   When Patricia Morison first met Cole Porter in
1947, she sang a Rodgers and Hammerstein song for him.
   ``I thought it was safer,'' she says with a laugh. Porter must
have liked what he heard from the young actress who at the time was
not known as a singer.
   ``He gave me the score for something called `Kiss Me, Kate' and
told me to learn it,'' Miss Morison recalls. ``He was having a
difficult time raising the money for the show. It took over a
year.''
   The wait was worth it. ``Kiss Me, Kate'' turned out to be
Porter's biggest musical success and gave Miss Morison the
opportunity to play the temperamental Lili Vanessi and sing such
songs as ``Wunderbar'' and ``So in Love.''
   Forty years later, she will sing those songs again in New York
at ``A Cabaret for Cole,'' one of the opening attractions of the
First New York International Festival of the Arts. The one-night
concert will be held Sunday at Town Hall.
   ``Broadway has always been my first love,'' says Miss Morison
who now lives in California. ``You never lose that once you've
tasted it.''
   One of the women who turned down a role in ``Kiss Me, Kate''
will also be on hand for the Sunday songfest. Mary Martin will sing
another Porter song, ``My Heart Belongs to Daddy'' from ``Leave It
to Me,'' a number she first sang on Broadway 50 years ago. The show
was Miss Martin's Broadway debut and the song, a coy striptease
number, made her a star.
   These two legendary women are not the only attractions at ``A
Cabaret for Cole.'' The other singers doing the songs of Cole
Porter also have impeccable credentials. They include Karen Akers,
Kaye Ballard, Barbara Cook, Michael Feinstein, Hildegarde, Sylvia
Syms, Margaret Whiting and Julie Wilson.
   The concert is a benefit for the Mabel Mercer Foundation which
was founded after Miss Mercer's death in 1984 to widen the audience
for cabaret. The singer was generally considered to be the supreme
cabaret artist, known for her ability to interpret a song's
emotional sense.
   From the late 1930s until the late 1970s, she sang in several
New York nightclubs including Le Ruban Bleu and Tony's, as well as
at the St. Regis Hotel.
   Porter was a great friend of Miss Mercer. He thought her
rendition of ``Just One of Those Things'' was the best version ever
done.
   For Miss Morison, the chance to appear in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' 40
years ago was a dream come true. To do it, she needed to get out of
a commitment to appear in what was a new line of work for actors in
1947 _ a TV series.
   ``I think it was called `The Cases of Eddie Drake,''' Miss
Morison says. ``I played a lady psychiatrist to whom the detective
came and told his stories, lying on the couch.''
   Miss Morison did get to New York after the producer shot all her
13 segments on the television show in a quick two-week period and
she agreed to publicize the series.
   ``Cole was a wonderful friend,'' Miss Morison says. ``He had an
essential musicality. Plus there was the elegance of his lyrics.
   ``I just saw a concert version of `Jubilee' which is where
`Begin the Beguine' came from. That was done in 1935. Even with all
the topical and `in' jokes of the period about Dorothy Parker and
Elsa Maxwell and Noel Coward and others, the young audience
watching it got everything. Cole never seems to really date.''

<TEXT>
   Experts investigating why the Sphinx
is crumbling say the culprit is sewage from a tacky tourist village
and a hotel favored by the rich and famous.
   Cries of alarm were raised in early February after a chunk of
limestone fell from the 4,500-year-old statue's right shoulder.
Suddenly, salt oozing through the limestone statue and previously
ignored cracks in its pharaoh's face and lion's body were seen as
evidence the monument was near collapse.
   A committee of specialists from Egypt, France, West Germany and
Italy probed, scraped and tested the stone for four months to see
what is happening to one of the world's best-known ancient
monuments.
   The answer is quickened decay, and the reason is sewage, said
Zahi Hawass, an Egyptologist and director general of the pyramids
area where the Sphinx has crouched since the Old Kingdom.
   Hawass blamed sewage water flowing freely from the nearby
tourist village of Nazlet al-Samman and an inadequate sewage system
at the well-known Mena House Hotel.
   Once a sleepy town at the edge of the desert, Nazlet al-Samman
has mushroomed in the last 20 years with an injection of funds
earned by locals in the Persian Gulf oil countries. The town boasts
an ever-sprouting array of tourist shops selling pharaonic
bric-a-brac, with names like Moses' Place, Pharaoh's Perfume
Factory and Cleo's Bazaar.
   Just to the northwest, the Mena House was built in 1868 to house
dignitaries assembled for the opening of the Suez Canal.
   The stately hotel's reputation grew over the decades as it
hosted Charlie Chaplin, British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery,
Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Jimmy Carter, Winston
Churchill and others. In 1974, 400 rooms were added to the original
150.
   Hawass said no sewage system was installed to meet the needs of
the bustling village, and the hotel's system was inadequate for its
expanded size. Thus, excess waste water entered the water table and
undermined the Sphinx.
   Before the recent study, Hawass said, it was assumed the statue
was deteriorating due to changes in the underground water table,
caused by the Aswan High Dam's regulation of the Nile River's flow.
   Now that the cause of the damage is determined, he said, work
will begin on repairing it.
   Egyptian experts are being joined by others from West Germany,
Britain and the University of Louisville in the United States to
formulate a long-term save-the-Sphinx plan.
   The government already has allocated $2.3 million for a new
sewage system aimed at halting the dirty-water flow beneath and
around the Sphinx, Hawass said.
   A committee set up to oversee repairs met Thursday and approved
plans to have a masonry support of limestone blocks laid just below
where the chunk of rock fell in February, then to replace the rock
on July 9.
   Hawass said restoration work in recent years, especially an
effort that began in 1982 and was stopped when the latest piece
fell, did not match ancient attempts to protect the monument. The
first on record was a patch-up campaign that began 1,000 years
after the Sphinx was created about 2,500 B.C.
   Hawass said cement used to secure loose rocks after 1982 had
turned the limestone to powder. ``The cement didn't allow the rocks
to breathe. Now we're removing all the cement and testing gypsum
mixed with rocks from Giza Plateau itself to see if the mix can't
protect sensitive areas.''
   The team of local and foreign experts also is to study the
effects on the Sphinx of Cairo's air pollution, which on most days
can be seen from Giza hovering in layers over the city of 12
million.
   Next to the Cheops Pyramid, the Sphinx is the most popular among
Egypt's thousands of monuments. But as Egyptians laugh at many of
the modern world's tribulations, they have chuckled at the Sphinx's
sewage problem through newspaper cartoons.
   In one cartoon, the Sphinx has lost his ever-present subtle
smile. He says: ``I don't care whether they call it waste water or
sewage runoff, this stuff stinks.''
   In another, pharaohs Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus, builders of
the world's three most famous pyramids on the plateau behind the
Sphinx, stand before an immigration officer, obviously ready to
leave town.
   ``We don't care what country you choose,'' one pharoah says,
``as long as it has a sewage system.''

   In a subdued setting of marble and etched glass,
bettors on Saturday's 120th running of the Belmont Stakes will drop
thousands of dollars while dining on the likes of Caesar salad or
lobster tails.
   It's called upscale wagering, and New York's Off-Track Betting
Corp. is counting on this as the course of its future.
   The restaurant in Manhattan's Wall Street financial district
with its thick carpeting, brass rails and maroon and sporting-green
decor is one of two opened within the last two years by OTB in the
city. Scattered through its rooms are 11 betting windows for
parimutuel wagers at track odds and several huge screens for
watching races.
   The restaurant, Skyward The Select Club, also has an overhead
stock-price ticker for Wall Street watchers and a $5 cover charge.
   The steep prices (lobster tails for lunch are $21.95), or at
least the ambiance that comes with them, are intended to attract
high-rollers. And it seems they do.
   ``We're consistently breaking $1,000 per capita daily, easily
North American records; other people say there's nothing
comparable,'' OTB spokeswoman Barbara Thompson said of the two
restaurants. Each exceeds the $1,000 mark at least five or six
times a month, she said, compared to an average of $20 to $30 per
bettor at other OTB offices.
   The upscale sites also are moneymakers in total take. Only about
the five busiest parlors in the city ever go over $100,000 a day,
and, Thompson said, the restaurants ``consistently'' do.
   OTB parlors, legal in the city since 1971, tend to be scruffy,
single rooms containing little more than betting windows, with no
seating, food service or toilet facilities. With the floors
littered by the debris of losing finishes, the city's stable of 104
standard-issue OTBs are hardly places to encourage the fastidious
to hang around and keep betting.
   But with the 1986 opening of its first restaurant, Inside Track
on the Upper East Side, OTB toned its image.
   Whether OTB is really attracting a new breed of bettor, or is
simply making life more pleasant for Damon Runyon characters of the
1980s, is hard to tell.
   A glance around The Select Club reveals few apparent tourists or
others unschooled in the ways of picking a daily double.
   For the conservative $2 bettor, a novice to the nuances between
a quinella and an exacta bet, the place has the hush and the aura
of serious business. Few murmur, much less cheer, even as horses
head for the finish. Many bettors do not dine, but sit hunched up
in easy chairs circled in front of the large screen at the end of
the main dining room.
   The $5 entrance fee doesn't apply to bettors who have a platinum
card _ that is, customers who keep a minimum of $1,000 in an OTB
escrow account. The betting corporation also takes telephone bets
and accepts credit cards from established patrons.
   A regular who would identify himself only as Keith said he's at
The Select Club every day until 4 p.m., when he's due at work
nearby. He carried a stack of punch-cards he said he uses to
handicap the horses.
   ``The history of every horse that races in this state is on
these cards,'' he said, shuffling the deck.
   When he was spotted there after 5 p.m. and asked why he wasn't
at work, he said he'd come in to cash a winning ticket for his boss.
   Keith said there was a mob at the restaurant for the Kentucky
Derby, and he expects the same Saturday. Actually, OTB figures
indicate that those who show up for high-profile races dilute the
take. On the Saturday before the Derby, paid admissions were 97 and
the per capita bet was $999. The 250 people on Derby day, May 7,
dropped the average to $650.
   In New York, the first of four states to legalize off-track
betting, the city's OTB has contributed $1.8 billion to city,
state, local governments and the racing industry from 1971 through
fiscal 1987.
   OTB President Howard P. Giordano said that in the city, where
the odds are high against finding low rents, OTB will continue to
upgrade its parlors ``just as fast as real estate will let us.''

<TEXT>
   Little League slugger Mike Curran has
hit six homeruns in his last 10 games. Now none of the opposing
teams will pitch to him, raising questions of less-than-adult
sportsmanship, his coaches say.
   Curran, 12, has a batting average of .888 and plays for the
league's top team, the Orioles. Harvey Katzen, one of Curran's
coaches, says the decision by the league's other coaches to
consistently walk the hot hitter fails to set a good example for
the players. Curran has been walked 12 times in his last four games.
   ``What are you teaching the kids? When they encounter a
difficult situation in life, they should avoid it?'' Katzen said.
   Curran's father, James P. Curran, said the general decision to
keep walking his son is unfair.
   ``The Little League should be for the kids, not the managers,''
he said. ``He's being punished because he is good.''
   The Middlesex News reported Thursday that the opposing coaches
have continued to intentionally walk the slugger despite a
league-wide advisory issued last week discouraging use of the
tactic.
   But the young player is taking it in stride.
   ``When they walk me, I just think about getting them back when I
pitch,'' he said. ``It's a joke really.''
   Curran has pitched two no-hitters this season.

<TEXT>
   USA Today founder Allen Neuharth, the
chairman of Gannett Corp., says he cares about sea turtles. It's
the Sea Turtle Protection Society he could do without.
   Society members patrol beaches nightly here in all-terrain
vehicles, searching for turtle poachers and bright lights that can
disorient nesting turtles.
   Two weeks ago, the society complained to police that lights at
Neuharth's oceanfront estate here were too bright under a city
ordinance that regulates beach lighting.
   A police officer knocked on the newspaper magnate's door after
midnight with two society members, Cocoa Beach City Manager Jim
Smith said.
   Neuharth told the officer that his lights did not violate the
ordinance because they were specially designed to direct the light
inland. He later complained about the intrusion to Cocoa Beach
Mayor Bob Lawton in a three-page letter.
   ``I strenuously object to this middle-of-the-night harassment,''
Neuharth wrote. ``I happen to agree with sea turtle supporters that
we should do anything within reason to encourage their nesting and
hatching. But I also know, as I'm sure you do, that sea turtle
soap-boxers are like all other special-interest pressure groups.
They get carried away with their causes.''
   Neuharth also threatened to sue the city if there is any
recurrence.
   Smith later told the society it could not use its vehicles on
the beach because it did not have a special permit.
   The society said it will no longer try to enforce the lighting
ordinance because the city's six-mile stretch of beach is too long
for volunteers to patrol each night on foot.

   ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' which swept
seven Tony Awards including Best Musical, will make its debut here
next May, says the show's British producer.
   ``We'll run the show as long as the Los Angeles public wants it
there,'' producer Cameron Mackintosh said from London Wednesday.
   The latest creation by British musical whiz Andrew Lloyd Webber
tells the story of a disfigured man in a mask who abducts the prima
donna of the Paris Opera House to the city sewers below.
   The show, which is scheduled to preview May 18 at the Los
Angeles County Music Center, will move to the Ahmanson Theater as
the fourth and final show of the 1988-89 Ahmanson season, and could
be booked for an extended run.
   The local ``Phantom'' will a new production with a budget
between $7 million and $8 million, Mackintosh said. Harold Prince,
who directed the New York version, will direct the Los Angeles, he
said.

   Leon Falk Jr., a leading Pittsburgh
industrialist and philanthropist died of a stroke Thursday. He was
86.
   Falk, whose foundations poured more than $10 million into the
University of Pittsburgh's medical programs, died at Shadyside
Hospital.
   The Falk family fortune was founded on steel. His father, Leon
Sr., and his uncle, Maurice, helped set up Weirton Steel Co. in the
1920s, which later became National Steel Corp.
   In 1929 Falk and his uncle established the Maurice and Laura
Falk Foundation, which during the Depression made large
contributions to economic research, creating the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
   In the late 1930s Falk became active in helping Jews escape Nazi
Germany, establishing an agricultural colony for Jewish immigrants
in the Dominican Republic.
   Falk supported the arts, including the Pittsburgh Symphony
Society and the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater.
   One of his hobbies was raising and marketing cattle at the
family farm in Schellsburg, Bedford County. He won honors at
national dairy cattle shows for his breeding of Jersey cows.
   In addition to his wife, Falk is survived by three daughters,
two sons, four stepsons, a stepdaughter and 26 grandchildren.

Acquisition</HEAD>

   A House subcommittee is recommending
continuation of bans on federal oil lease sales off the coasts of
California and New England and renewal of one covering part of
Florida's coast.
   The stance was taken Wednesday by the Appropriations interior
subcommittee as it gave voice-vote approval to a $9.7 billion
spending package for the Interior Department and the U.S. Forest
Service for the year beginning Oct. 1.
   The legislation would continue the bans that Congress has been
placing yearly on leasing oil and gas tracts in northern California
and along the Georges Bank in the Atlantic.
   It would also reinstate a leasing ban for southwest Florida
waters that had been imposed by Congress through September 1987.
   Chairman Sidney Yates, D-Ill., said he thought the proposed
bans, lasting through Sept. 30, 1989, would be endorsed by the full
committee at a vote scheduled for next week.
   The subcommittee bill, giving the department $400 million more
than it is receiving this year, would boost spending by the
National Park Service to $950 million, an increase of $50 million
over current levels.
   The legislation would provide $170 million to acquire land for
wildlife refuges and other open-space uses. That is more than 10
times the $15 million requested by the Reagan administration.
   Under the spending plan, the U.S. Forest Service would get $1.8
billion, a $100 million increase. Construction of logging roads
would be set at $166 million, down from the current $196 million.
   For the second straight year, the Tongass National Forest in
Alaska would get less than the $50 million annual appropriation it
is supposed to receive under a temporarily suspended federal law.
   The huge forest, which conservationists say is being
overharvested by commercial timbering, would get $31 million, $12
million below this year's level and $22 million under what the
administration sought for fiscal 1989.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York investment banker Nicholas Brady, who
has often served as an outside consultant to the Reagan
administration, may soon be joining the administration as the next
treasury secretary.
   Administration sources said Wednesday that Brady is on a short
list of candidates to succeed Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III, who is expected to resign this summer to oversee Vice
President George Bush's general-election campaign.
   These sources, who spoke on condition that their names not be
used, said that Brady was the leading candidate. They said other
officials being considered are Deputy Secretary of State John
Whitehead and Treasury Undersecretary George Gould.
   Publicly, all sides were saying that Baker has made no decision
to step down, but sources said that the decision was very close to
being made and the White House had begun reviewing possible
successors.
   Brady, the co-chairman of the Wall Street investment firm of
Dillon, Read & Co., is close friends of both Bush and Baker, and
because of these ties the administration has used him in a
succession of advisory positions.
   He headed the administration task force which investigated the
causes of last October's stock market crash although his final
report, which called for tighter regulations of financial markets,
displeased the administration's free-market advocates.
   In addition to leading the Brady commission, Brady has served at
the president's request on the Packard Commission that studied
defense reforms; the Scowcroft Commission that studied MX missile
deployment; and the Kissinger Commission that studied U.S. policy
in Central America.
   One source said the ultimate choice was likely to wind up
between Brady and Whitehead because Gould, while highly respected
for the job he has done on banking issues, does not have the
necessary international experience for the top spot.
   In addition, Gould holds the No. 3 job at Treasury and his
elevation to the top spot would be seen as a slap at Deputy
Treasury Secretary M. Peter McPherson, the No. 2 official.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
insisted that the administration did not have any candidate list
because no vacancy exists. But the Wall Street Journal reported
Wednesday that the selection of Brady was being discussed at the
``highest echelons'' of the administration.
   The choice of Brady would likely be well received in domestic
and international financial markets, in part because of his
longtime ties with both Bush and Baker.
   The markets, which are still jittery after the October collapse,
would likely view Brady as someone brought in to continue the
approach started by Baker, who has won high praise for his handling
of economic issues.
   Sources said they believe Baker will step aside as Treasury
secretary sometime around the Aug. 15-18 Republican convention to
run Bush's campaign, a belief that has intensified in recent weeks
as the Bush camp has been beset by internal staff dissension and
the candidate's plunge in the polls behind Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Baker has denied he has decided to leave his post to join the
Bush campaign, saying as recently as Sunday that ``there is no
agreement, no arrangement, no deal.''
   But Baker has also been saying recently that he would respect
the wishes of the president and vice president on his future.
   Brady refused to comment on the speculation, saying: ``I've
heard the rumor a hundred times. I'm very happy at Dillon Read and
I intend to stay here. I'm not going to speculate about a
hypothetical comment.''
   Brady served briefly in the Senate in 1982 when he filled out
the term of former Sen. Harrison Williams of New Jersey, who was
convicted of bribery and corruption in the 1980 Abscam scandal.
   Brady had been viewed as the front-running candidate to serve as
Treasury secretary in a Bush administration.
   His elevation to that job in the Reagan administration would
make sense, sources said, because as a former senator he could be
expected to have an easier time winning Senate confirmation, a
primary consideration given that only seven months remain in the
current administration.

   John Glenn says the Democrats' vice

   ``But I've talked to Neil Armstrong, and he's not interested,''

the second spot on the national ticket with probable nominee
Michael Dukakis. And many Democratic insiders agree that the first
American to orbit the Earth would be a good choice.
   ``He's on everybody's short list and ought to be,'' Democratic
party chief Paul Kirk told a Chicago fund-raising audience recently
as he introduced Glenn.
   Even Jesse Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, puts Glenn
on his VP list, right behind Jackson.
   ``It's a great American story. You take Mike Dukakis, son of
Greek immigrants, and John Glenn, a small-town boy who married his
childhood sweetheart, a woman who overcame a stuttering problem _
and then Glenn goes on to be the world's most famous astronaut and
a U.S. senator,'' said Austin, an Ohio political consultant.
   And a recent California poll provides another argument for
Glenn, who hails from New Concord, Ohio.
   Dukakis led Bush without any mention of a running mate by 13
points in mid-May. But with Gov. George Deukmejian on the GOP
ticket, it was an even race.
   Except against Dukakis and Glenn. That Democratic ticket bested
the home-state choice in California by 10 percentage points.
   Glenn's office declined a request for an interview to discuss
the possibility of the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   So why won't Dukakis pick Glenn, who will celebrate his 67th
birthday on the day the Democratic National Convention opens in
Atlanta on July 18?
   One big reason is 1984.
   Glenn sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984, an
effort that was, by even his own account, a disaster.
   ``I humiliated my family, gained 16 pounds and went over $2.5
million in debt. Outside of that, it was a great experience,''
Glenn said last year in assessing his 1984 performance.
   Glenn was judged the top opponent to former Vice President
Walter Mondale for the 1984 nomination. But a campaign torn by
dissention and lackluster performances on the stump by the
candidate brought a quick end to the bid before spring.
   Even if the memories of 1984 fade, the debt hasn't.
   The campaign still owes about $2.4 million to vendors and to
four Ohio banks, more than four years later. And much of that time
has been spent fighting with the Federal Election Commission over
the legality of the loans. That battle was settled last year with a
promise by the campaign to pay $4,000 to the FEC.
   With Dukakis emphasizing his own management of fiscal policy and
his legendary tight-fisted personal habits, Glenn's debt might be a
problem.
   What most Americans remember about Glenn comes not from 1984,
but from 1962.
   That year the Marine Corps pilot was the first American to orbit
the Earth, blasting off from Cape Canaveral aboard the Mercury
capsule, Friendship 7, on a journey that moved the nation firmly
back into the space race.
   Glenn returned to ticker-tape parades and the adulation of a
nation that had been shaken by Soviet successes in space.
   He returned to Ohio to enter politics in his home state, but
success eluded him. He failed in Senate bids in 1964 and 1970,
before winning a bitterly contested primary against Howard
Metzenbaum in 1974 and going on to Capitol Hill.
   The retired Marine Corps officer has followed a moderately
liberal course in the Senate, focusing intensely on one or two
issues, too intensely critics have said. But he has been the
Senate's expert on efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to
other countries.
   His record on military matters has not been one of unquestioning
support for the Pentagon. Glenn supported the B-1 bomber strongly,
but opposed the MX missile. He backed production of binary nerve
gas weapons, but opposed aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Through his career, he has had moderately high ratings from
liberal groups such as the Americans for Democratic Action and
moderately low marks from conservative groups such as the American
Conservative Union.
   And he argues that such a middle path is the winning choice for
the party in the general election.
   ``The Democratic Party should pursue a reasoned and a middle
course,'' Glenn says. ``If our agenda is the nation's agenda, then
rank-and-file Americans will come home to the Democratic Party. I
believe we can and should be the party of ... the sensible center.''

<TEXT>
   Burned but not shy after its unsuccessful
venture with ``Amazing Stories'' two years ago, Steven Spielberg's
Amblin Entertainment is ready to plunge into television in a big
way.
   Amblin has organized a new television division to be headed by
Carole M. Kirschner, the company announced Wednesday. She had been
director of comedy development at CBS, where she worked on such
shows as ``Designing Women,'' ``Frank's Place'' and ``Coming of
Age.''
   Amblin's new television division will concentrate on developing
TV series programming, particularly half-hour comedies and
hour-long concepts.
   Spielberg's company is most noted for its motion pictures, which
include the monster hit ``E.T. - The Extraterrestrial,'' ``The
Color Purple,'' and ``The Money Pit.''
   His first venture into television since founding Amblin was
``Amazing Stories'' for NBC two years ago. It was a critical and a
ratings failure.

   It could be the lead-in to a prime time crime
show. With the rat-a-tat of a machine gun and a wailing siren in
the background, a deep-voiced announcer delivers his lines.
Pictures of assassination victims flash on the screen.
   In fact, it's an ad for the government of Colombia.
   For the past week or so, stations in New York and Washington
have been showing 15-second spots purchased by Colombia to
dramatize its position on the front lines of the global drug war
and dispel the notion Colombians aren't fighting the drug lords.
   ``All we ask, when you think of Colombia, don't just think of
the drug dealers; remember the Colombian heroes who are dying every
day,'' the announcer says.
   Half-page ads displaying the names of ``fallen heroes in the war
against drugs'' _ policemen, judges, government ministers,
journalists and prosecutors killed in Colombia _ have appeared in
The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post.
   Rodrigo Pardo, counselor to Colombian President Virgilio Barco,
said Wednesday that the $350,000 campaign is an effort to counter
an impression Americans might have that Colombia is complacent
about its reputation as a drug barony.
   ``We want to show it isn't true, that we are engaged in a
struggle,'' he said. The ads are ``a step toward an accurate
understanding of the situation.''
   President Barco, as it turned out, had to cancel a U.S. visit to
promote the campaign because of what might be another battle in the
drug war: the kidnapping of Alvara Gomez Hurtado, a leading
Colombian political figure. Barco stayed home to monitor the crisis
caused by Hurtado's abduction.
   For years, South and Central American countries listed as major
sources of narcotics for the U.S. market have been asserting that
the Reagan administration should stop picking on producing
countries and do more to stop demand on the streets of America.
   Standing in for Barco at a news conference at the Colombian
embassy, Foreign Minister Julio Londono stated the view bluntly.
Asked if he thought President Reagan was doing enough to stop
drugs, Londono declared, ``all the information I have received
shows the consumption of drugs has increased the past few years.''
   ``I'm surprised that when you walk down 42nd Street in New York
people are selling phony watches, cocaine and crack and that's
right under the noses of the police,'' Londono said. ``I would hope
there is sure punishment on a daily basis to those selling in the
streets.''
   As for the use of U.S. military forces to stop drugs in
Colombia, Londono said, ``It would be akin to the Colombian police
going to New York City to help the New York police stop drug
consumption.''
   The print ads prepared by the Sawyer Miller Group, a New York
agency handling the campaign, suggest that Colombia is fighting
drugs, but the United States' campaign is all talk.
   Below a news photo of a funeral cortege, presumably for a
government victim of the drug cartel, the ad says, ``In Colombia,
Our Drug War Is Not A War of Words.''
   Another ad says: ``In America, we ask you to remember that our
war is your war. We are fighting for our children ... and for
yours. We must fight for the future of all of us. And to win this
war we must fight together.''

<TEXT>
   A pair of congressmen who are working to have
the first Medals of Honor awarded to black servicemen who fought in
the two world wars say they'll take their case to the White House
if the Pentagon can't be swayed.
   Sgt. Henry Johnson, a World War I hero, and Seaman Dorrie
Miller, a World War II hero, were among the 1.37 million black
Americans who fought for the United States during the two world
wars.
   Reps. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., and Mickey Leland, D-Texas, sent
a letter Wednesday signed by 102 of their colleagues asking Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci to clear the way for the medals to be
awarded. Both Johnson and Miller are deceased.
   Of the 549 Medals of Honor that were awarded for heroism during
the two wars, not one went to a black serviceman, DioGuardi said.
``The basic issue here is fundamental justice,'' he said at a news
conference Wednesday.
   ``I think the next step at this point is to hope that Secretary
Carlucci recognizes this is an oversight,'' he said. ``No matter
what the secretary does, no matter what the Army does, no matter
what the Navy does, we are prepared to go to the White House to get
these medals issued.''
   Last month, Army and Navy brass wrote to Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wisc., who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to
voice their opposition to legislation that would allow the two
servicemen to be considered for the medal. The Army and Navy object
because the statute of limitations for awarding the medals ran out
long ago.
   ``Many Medals (of Honor) have been awarded after the five-year
limitations statute has expired,'' the congressmen wrote to
Carlucci. ``We need to correct this as soon as possible.''
   The legislation, introduced last October by DioGuardi and
Leland, is stalled in the Armed Services Committee for lack of
Pentagon support. Leland said the bill was unlikely to go anywhere
without Army and Navy backing.
   ``We would rather not have a war against the Pentagon,'' he said
at the news conference.
   DioGuardi also said aides to President Reagan told him last week
that the White House will not put up roadblocks to the bill.
   Johnson, of Albany, N.Y., served in France during World War I.
One night while on sentry duty, he killed four German soldiers,
rescued a wounded comrade and captured a stockpile of weapons,
despite being severely wounded himself. He was awarded the Croix de
Guerre, France's highest military honor.
   Miller, of Waco, Texas, was stationed as a mess steward aboard
the USS Virginia when the ship was attacked at Pearl Harbor. When
his captain was mortally wounded, Miller dragged him to safety and
manned a machine gun, shooting down two enemy aircraft. He was
awarded the Navy Cross, the service's second highest honor. A
warship, the USS Miller, was named in his honor in 1971.

   An alleged gangster who
survived a mob-style attack two years ago was gunned down in a
hospital corridor. Police described the slaying as part of an
underworld feud.
   An official of the Carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary force, said
a gunman, firing an automatic weapon, killed Francesco Stillittano,
34, on Wednesday.
   Stillittano was hit 10 times, including in the head and the
heart, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The victim was in Polyclinic Hospital, apparently to visit his
daughter, the official said, and was shot in a hallway near an
entrance.
   He said the gunman escaped, possible aided by an accomplice, and
that the investigation has been hampered by reluctance of witnesses
to talk to police.
   Two years ago, Stillittano, who has been convicted of criminal
association, was leaving his house to go to work in a pastry shop
when gunmen opened fire. Stillittano was injured and a railway
worker who accidentally got into the way was killed, the
Carabinieri official said.
   Police said both attacks appeared connected to a bloody rivalry
between two clans of the 'ndrangheta, Calabria's version of the
Mafia.
   Reggio Di Calabria, at the tip of the Italian peninsula, is
Italy's deadliest province, where police say mob families are
engaged in a bitter battle for control of construction and other
public contracts.

   House rejection of a home health care plan
buried any chance of action on the proposal this year, but
lawmakers and lobbyists say the next Congress is likely to pass an
even broader program.
   ``It is safe to say that 1989 will be the year that Congress
considers seriously a comprehensive long-term care program,'' said
Ron Pollack, executive director of Villers Advocacy Associates, a
lobbying group for the low-income elderly.
   The House on Wednesday voted 243-169 not to consider a long-term
home health care bill proposed by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., 87,
known and revered by senior citizens across the country as a
champion of their concerns.
   Pepper won lavish praise from his colleagues and a standing
ovation after making a tearful appeal for his five-year, $28
billion Medicare expansion plan. But in the end he was defeated by
a coalition of Democrats and Republicans who objected not only to
parts of the bill itself but also to the fact that it never
underwent committee scrutiny.
   The vote ``was not a vote against the elderly, or others in need
of long-term care,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over
Medicare.
   Rostenkowski said a commission on long-term care needs _ both at
home and in nursing homes _ is scheduled to report to Congress in
six months.
   ``I fully anticipate that the commission's report and
recommendations will form the starting point for congressional
action on long-term health care in the next Congress, irrespective
of who is the president in November,'' Rostenkowski said on the
floor.
   Pepper's bill would have provided long-term home services to the
disabled and chronically ill of all ages. It would have been
financed by imposing the Medicare payroll tax on income above
$45,000, which is currently exempt. An estimated 2.2 million people
would qualify for the benefit in 1990.
   The bill came to the floor without going to Rostenkowski's panel
or the Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., as a result of a special arrangement between Pepper and
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   The spurned chairmen ``put on a lot of heat,'' Pepper commented
after the vote. He accused the 99 Democrats who voted against him
of forgetting ``what the Democratic Party stands for.'' The
Republicans, he said, ``have not changed their stripes.''
   Pepper won the opportunity for a floor vote by agreeing not to
attach his plan to the catastrophic illness bill that won final
congressional passage Wednesday and was headed for the White House.
House leaders feared it would sink that bill, a Reagan
administration initiative designed to help the elderly deal with
the costs of acute illness.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., blasted the
Pepper bill as ``a shallow and costly election year paste-up job.''
Long-term care ``should be viewed as a health care problem and not
a political opportunity,'' he said.
   Lawmakers of both parties voiced concerns ranging from the cost
of the bill to its lack of aid to nursing home patients and their
families.
   Many said the program promised more than it could deliver
because the agencies and services it requires do not yet exist.
They questioned opening Medicare to all age groups as well as a
provision requiring Congress to cut services and charge
beneficiaries if, as expected, the program began to run a deficit.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Pepper program
would cost $28 billion over five years and, after that, the
Medicare tax increase would not be enough to cover it. Health and
Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said administration
calculations indicate the program would rack up a $9 billion
deficit in 1990 and $26 billion by 2000.
   Among those fighting the Pepper bill was the Coordinating
Committee for Long-Term Care Policy, a coalition of insurance and
business groups that includes the American Council of Life
Insurance and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The chamber praised the House action in a statement issued after
the vote. The group said filling the gaps in long-term care ``will
require a partnership between the public and private sectors, not
precipitous action by government alone.''

   Education Secretary William Bennett is
opposing proposals within the Reagan administration to take away
student loans, drivers' licenses and public housing from anyone
convicted of using drugs, administration sources say.
   The Cabinet-level National Drug Policy Board is considering
whether to endorse withholding federal aid from state and local
governments, colleges and universities and other publicly financed
institutions if they don't adopt the anti-drug proposals, which are
still in the discussion stage. Attorney General Edwin Meese III
chairs the policy board.
   ``Some of these measures may appear Draconian but may be very
necessary, while others may be Draconian and may be rejected, but
the point is that somehow, some way, the American public needs a
2-by-4 between the eyes to convince them to stop this insatiable
appetite for drugs,'' said acting Associate Attorney General
Francis Keating, the No. 3 official at the Justice Department.
   But Bennett is trying to steer the Reagan administration away
from the proposals.
   Bennett, who favors increased use of the military as an
anti-drug measure, has expressed doubts that the current proposals
would be effective, administration sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Wednesday.
   A spokesman for the Department of Education, Loye Miller,
declined to comment on Bennett's views.
   Under current law, educational institutions receiving federal
aid are required to certify that they have drug abuse prevention
programs. The drug policy board is considering support for
toughening those requirements with specific punishments for drug
pushers and users. While Bennett doesn't oppose ``putting teeth in
the law,'' he doesn't feel such steps are ``central to the war on
drugs,'' said one source.
   Bennett argued successfully at a policy board meeting May 27
against one proposal, to make anyone ineligible for student aid
once they are convicted of drug use, according to the sources.
   At the meeting, Bennett ``focused on the broader point as well,
that we should be extremely tough on people who are pushing drugs
in public housing projects or anywhere else, but that we want to
protect the people living in public housing, not putting our weight
behind proposals that would cut off aid to poor people,'' said one
source.
   If endorsed by the policy board, the White House and adopted
through a combination of legislation and federal regulation, the
proposals would represent an expansion of the administration's
``zero tolerance'' program. Under it, law enforcement officials are
seizing cars and boats in which drugs are found, no matter how
small the amount.
   Policy board members are discussing having student loan
recipients sign a document stating that being a convicted drug user
can mean loss of the loan.
   They also are discussing making it a federal crime to sell drugs
near public housing, similar to the federal schoolyard law making
it a federal crime to sell drugs in the vicinity of schools.
   Another proposal under discussion at the policy board calls for
state governments to refuse to issue first-time drivers' licenses
to minors who have been convicted of drug use. The federal
government would enforce this by threatening to withhold federal
transportation financing.

   Vice President George Bush, trying to
recapture lost ground in public opinion polls, is revamping his
campaign tactics and will seek to take the offensive in the weeks
ahead, campaign advisers say.
   Part of Bush's new post-primary strategy will include trying to
paint Democrat Michael Dukakis as an ultra-liberal ``to the left of
(Walter) Mondale,'' said campaign official Ed Rogers, referring to
the 1984 Democratic presidential candidate.
   ``The guy (Dukakis) is a wimp. The guy opposes every major
weapons system there is. He is for the nuclear freeze, he is
against more aircraft carriers, he is for pulling troops out of
South Korea. He's a Sandinista lover. He'll blast our allies and
say nothing bad about the Sandinistas or Castro,'' Rogers said.
   But other Bush advisers, and prominent Republican leaders,
caution that such attacks could go too far.
   ``You don't become president by only diminishing your opponent.
That, in fact, enlarges your opponent,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill., national co-chair of Bush's presidential campaign.
   John Sears, a Washington lawyer and political consultant who
managed Ronald Reagan's unsuccessful 1976 presidential bid, agreed.
   ``He isn't that far back in the polls to be desperate,'' Sears
said. ``Attacks on Dukakis at this point could come back in his
face. He should be out there making positive points about what this
administration has accomplished and not let the agenda be
constructed by the Democrats.''
   Bush, changing gears with the Tuesday's end of the primary
season, was embarking today on a series of appearances aimed at
building up party unity and broadening his base of support outside
the traditional GOP constituencies.
   The vice president was flying to his adopted hometown of
Houston, where he will meet with a group of Hispanics and address
the Texas state Republican convention.
   On Friday, he'll travel to Denver for the first in a series of
what the GOP has billed ``Unity '88'' conferences. Bush will be
joined there by three vanquished Republican White House hopefuls _
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp and television
evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Meanwhile, Reagan on Tuesday promised to do ``everything I can''
to help Bush win in November and said Bush shouldn't worry about
his underdog status in the polls.
   ``I'd say, `George, wait until you and I get out there on the
trail and start pinning him (Dukakis) down on the things he claims,
which we know are not true,''' Reagan said during a
question-and-answer session with regional reporters.
   Reagan said Bush had ``a part of everything we've accomplished
in this administration.''
   The president appeared unconcerned about recent attempts by Bush
to distance himself from the administration's policies.
   In particular, Reagan was asked to respond to comments the vice
president made about the Soviet Union and human rights issues,
which seemed at odds with Reagan's more positive assessments voiced
at the Moscow summit.
   ``No, he's being as careful as we all must be,'' Reagan said.
   Bush advisers said that candidate's post-primary strategy will
focus on Dukakis' record as governor of Massachusetts and will
stress both his lack of foreign policy experience and his
opposition to weapons systems.
   A Republican party official knowledgeable about the Bush
campaign's general election strategy said that Bush was unlikely to
break with Reagan over any heavyweight issues such as the 1981 tax
cuts, the easing of government regulation of business or the
military buildup.
   ``I don't think Bush is going to give a `stop the bombing'
statement like Hubert Humphrey, when he broke with Lyndon Johnson
over Vietnam,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   In fact, this official said, the Bush campaign may be spending
too much time engaging in discussions of the candidate's obstacles
to election this fall. ``There may be too much
temperature-taking,'' he said.
   Bush will be partly constrained in his activities until after he
formally receives the GOP nomination in August by a shortage of
funds.
   The campaign is within just $1 million of the federal
pre-convention $27 million spending limit and had to lay off dozens
of campaign workers. But aides said Bush would take advantage of
other fund-raising events _ including today's Texas GOP convention
and Friday's unity dinner in Denver.
   ``We can raise money for the Republican National Committee, for
Republican candidates, for the unity conferences, for state
parties,'' said Bush spokesman Stephen Hart.

   Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., the controversial
former U.S. Civil Rights Commission chairman, was eulogized
Wednesday as a tireless advocate of a colorblind society who died
before seeing his dream achieved.
   ``Sadly, a strong voice has been silenced, but not the words he
gave us or his powerful thoughts,'' said William Bradford Reynolds,
assistant U.S. Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.
   ``Clarence Pendleton was a remarkable leader, a man in many ways
ahead of his time,'' he said.
   Pendleton, 57, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack while
exercising in a San Diego health club. He was the first black to
head the nation's Civil Rights Commission when President Reagan
appointed him to the post in 1981.
   His wife, Margrit, and three children attended the service at
St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral with more than 500 mourners,
including U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Civil Rights
commissioners and government officials.
   ``He was one of the outstanding leaders of President Reagan's
team, and he will be missed very much,'' Meese said afterwards.
   Pendleton's conservative views, such as his frequent reference
to programs that specially benefitted minorities as ``the new
racism,'' angered some congressional members and civil right
leaders.
   But Reynolds praised Pendleton in his eulogy for daring to
challenge conventional ideas advocating racial equality through
affirmative action quotas and similar programs.
   ``The road Penny traveled was not smooth or easy, and ...
integrity was his middle name,'' Reynolds said. ``He held to his
beliefs tenaciously and was not afraid to stand alone.''
   Pendleton's wife and 9-year-old daughter, Paula, each placed a
red rose on top of his coffin as six pallbearers, including San
Diego Police Chief Bill Kolender, wheeled it to the hearse after
the funeral service ended.
   Reynolds, whom Pendleton counted among his best friends along
with Meese, said the former head of the San Diego Urban League
shared the dream of a society without racial prejudice ``just as
fervently and just as fully'' as slain civil rights leader, the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   Pendleton's body will be cremated and his ashes buried at
Lincoln Memorial Cemetary during a yet-unscheduled private
interment, Civil Rights Commission spokesman John Eastman said.
   A public memorial service in Washington, D.C., is planned
sometime within the next two weeks, he said.

<HEAD>Cuomo Endorsement For Dukakis _ Finally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo finally endorsed
Michael Dukakis for the Democratic presidential nomination, but
insists his support was ``never relevant.''
   In the early stages of the campaign, many Democrats had hoped
that Cuomo might emerge as the nominee. Cuomo repeatedly said he
wasn't running, but refused to flatly rule out a draft until less
than two months ago.
   Cuomo gave his backing to Dukakis on Wednesday, a day after the
Massachusetts governor wrapped up the nomination in the final four
primaries of the season.
   Cuomo's public endorsement of Dukakis came only after prodding
by reporters at the governor's news conference. When Cuomo revealed
that he had talked to Dukakis on Wednesday morning, reporters asked
about an endorsement, and Cuomo brushed the question aside.
   ``For months, I said I was for whoever comes out of the primary
process first ... so that was a fait accompli as soon as the
primaries were over,'' said Cuomo.
   Pressed on the point, he said, ``It's an empty question. ... My
endorsement was never relevant.''
   ``Why can't you bring yourself to say that you endorse him?''
one reporter finally asked.
   ``I endorse him! I endorse him! I endorse him!'' Cuomo burst out
in response. ``There, three times I endorsed him.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis has gained the support
of Rep. Richard Gephardt, a former rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Dukakis, who stopped briefly at Lambert St. Louis Airport on
Wednesday, told a small group of supporters and local politicians
that he was happy to have the Missouri congressman's endorsement.
   ``I will not forget his support,'' Dukakis said.
   Gephardt asked every Democrat who had stood with him before to
stand with him once more as he throws his support to Dukakis.
   ``Together we can regain America's true strength, reclaim
America's true legacy, and restore America's true promise,''
Gephardt said. ``That is the vision Mike Dukakis and I share. That
is the fight we now wage together.''
   Dukakis staffers released a list of Missouri delegates who they
say are switching support to Dukakis. At least 27 of Gephardt's
remaining 42 delegates in Missouri have now committed to Dukakis,
according to Gephardt aide Joyce Aboussie.

   Relatives of Michael Dukakis from the
island of Mytilene on Wednesday hailed his success in wrapping up
the Democratic presidential nomination as ``a great achievement for
us and for Greece.''
   In Pelopi, home of the Dukakis family before they migrated to
the United States, the village council already has renamed the main
street after him.
   They also erected a pair of signs on the dirt road leading to
Pelopi announcing in Greek and English: ``Welcome to the home town
of Michael Dukakis.''
   ``Michael's progress is a great achievement for us and for
Greece. He deserves to become president. ... I think he could write
a golden page in Greek history,'' Mrs. Cleopatra Stephanidou, a
second cousin of the Massachussetts governor, said in a telephone
interview from Mytilene.
   Costas Stephanou, president of the Pelopi village council and a
distant family relative, said by telephone: ``This is really a
great achievement. I'm convinced he can become president.''
   Stephanou said residents of Pelopi, a village of just over 600
people, have been closely following primary election results for
weeks, hoping that Dukakis would wrap up the nomination.

<HEAD>Farm Export Forecasts Raised By $1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department economists are
forecasting an additional $1 billion in farm exports over
February's estimate for the current year, raising the total amount
to $33.5 billion.
   The volume of exports also should increase by 3 million tons to
145.5 million, USDA said Wednesday in a report on the outlook for
farm exports.
   It said the rise in value chiefly reflects greater shipments of
animal and horticultural products as well as soybeans.
   Tonnage increased was primarily attributed to additional
shipments of wheat, feed ingredients and soybeans.
   The forcast was for an increase of 16 million tons and $5.6
billion over the export levels for last year.
   Animal products, in this case mainly those derived from
livestock, were estimated to be in for a $600 million increase to a
record $5.6 billion, an increase of 12 percent. Stronger demand
overseas is bringing higher prices for red meats, animal fats,
hides and skins, the report said.
   Meanwhile, USDA economists said imports would climb $500 million
from February's estimate to $21 billion. They said the nation's
surplus in agricultural trade most likely would reach $12.5 billion.
   Wheat and flour exports are being estimated at 40.2 million
tons, an increase of 1.2 million tons or 3 percent from the
previous forecast, the report said. It attributed a significant
amount of the gain to Export Enhancement Program payments to grain
companies to subsdize sales.
   Much of the increase was due to purchases by the Soviet Union
and China, the report said. It said India is also buying more wheat
this year.
   Reduced Brazilian soybean production was cited by the economists
as the reason for prospective $300 million increase in oilseed and
oilseed products exports to $7.7 billion. Most of the increase was
expected to be in soybeans.
   The increase also was expected to more than offset By a
prospective reduction in soybean meal exports.
   Exports of sunflower seed oil should reach 300,000 tons, the
report said, from a previous forecast of 200,000 tons.
   Competitive prices stemming from the lower dollar plus a
substantial boost in U.S. almond sales in Western Europe and the
Soviet Union are contributing to improved prospects for
horticultural products, the economists said. They put the forecast
at $3.7 billion, an increase of $200 million from the previous
forecast.
   Coarse grain, rice, cotton and tobacco exports were expected to
remain at the levels forecast in February, according to the
document.

   An 18-year-old rule that bars husbands and
their wives from each collecting federal farm payments is being
eased.
   Responding to a federal court order, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng said the Agriculture Department would no longer
consider husbands and wives engaged in separate farming operations
before and after their marriage as ``one person'' when federal
payments are being figured.
   Under the rule, when husband and wife are viewed as ``one
person'' they are eligible for only one payment.
   The announcement Wednesday came after a U.S. District Court here
ordered the department to halt the practice with respect to
husbands and wives who contribute equally to farming operations.
   The court acted in a lawsuit filed by Women Involved in Farm
Economics (WIFE), a nationwide organization of farm women. It
called the rule unfair.
   Lyng said the new rule would apply to the 1988 crop year and was
subject to revocation if USDA wins its appeal of the lower court
ruling.
   The payments would have to be refunded with interest if the
appeals court overturns the ruling, Lyng added.

   USDA scientists said Wednesday they are
fighting an $800,000 war against the Russian wheat aphid, a newly
imported pest that caused an estimated $36 million in damage to
wheat and feed grains last year.
   ``We will look for methods that will work even if the pests are
protected under curled leaves,'' said Richard S. Soper, an official
of USDA's Agricultural Research Service.
   The wind-borne pest native to the Soviet Union, Iran and
Afghanistan injects disease and toxins into leaves as it feeds on
them.
   It was first detected in the Texas Panhandle in 1986 and has
since spread to 13 western states, the department said. It said the
pest was believed to have arrived in Texas from Mexico.
   Some 60 million acres are considered susceptible to the
creature's attack, the department added.

<HEAD>Jackson Pushing Hard For Vice Presidential Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says the vice presidency is a
great job and anyone who thinks he wouldn't want it should think
again.
   While Jackson didn't come out and say he wants the post, he used
glowing terms Wednesday to characterize it as ``a position of great
leadership and great responsibility.''
   ``You understand my background?'' the Baptist minster who was
born illegitimately to a poor teen-age girl in South Carolina asked
reporters Wednesday.
   ``The vice presidency is not quite the top, but it's a long way
from where I started,'' he added, speaking on the day after he
suffered a final round of primary losses to Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson arrived Wednesday night at the posh La Costa resort near
San Diego. He had no activities scheduled today except an afternoon
meeting with aides.
   Jackson has been saying for some time that he deserves to be
considered for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. After Dukakis won
enough delegates for the nomination, Jackson took it one step
further.
   ``Consideration means an offer,'' he said. ``If in fact, the
offer is made, at that time I'll make a judgment but I've earned
that option.''
   He told reporters he has a good resume for the job.
   ``If the issue is we need someone from the South _ I'm from the
South,'' he said. ``Someone who can mobilize masses of Democrats _
I've done that. Someone not limited to regional appeal but has
national appeal _ I've won primaries'' across the nation.
   On the day after Dukakis beat him resoundingly in the last four
primary contests Jackson was asked if he were conceding the
nomination.
   ``Of course not,'' he said. ``The nominee will be determined by
the convention in Atlanta.''
   However, he extended congratulations to Dukakis on Tuesday night
after the Massachusetts governor won primaries in California, New
Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   Jackson said he will be contacting all the so-called super
delegates and at-large delegates, even those who have announced
support for Dukakis.
   ``These delegates are by definition not committed until they
vote. Their votes are fluid. We will compete in every state and in
every congressional district for their support,'' he said.
   Jackson announced a busy schedule for the weeks leading up to
the convention.
   He will hold strategy meetings with advisers regarding the
convention and a series of meetings with interest groups, beginning
next week with civil rights leaders in Chicago.
   Jackson also plans speaking appearances, a voter registration
drive, and a strategy to woo more delegates to his side.
   Between now and the convention, Jackson said, he wants to press
Dukakis and the Democrats to come around to his positions on issues
and on delegate selection rules that he considers unfair.
   He indicated he expects to have such changes apply not only to
future conventions but to be put in place this year to help him
garner the added delegate strength he believes he has earned.
   He cited Pennsylvania and New Jersey where the winner of each
district gets all that district's delegates, rather than having
them distributed proportionately according to the popular vote. For
Jackson that resulted in far fewer delegates than he would have
received if they were chosen proportionately.
   He said he had spoken Wednesday morning to Democratic Party
chairman Paul Kirk and was confident they could work out ``some
remedy.''

   Here is the 61-37 roll call Wednesday by which
the Senate failed to override President Reagan's veto of the trade
bill.
   On this vote, a ``yes'' vote was a vote to override the
president's veto while a ``no'' vote was a vote to support the veto.
   A two-thirds majority ``yes'' vote by the 98 senators who were
voting on the bill was required to override the president's veto
and thus put the bill into law over his objections. Because a
two-thirds majority ``yes'' vote was not obtained, Reagan's veto
was sustained and the bill thus died.
   Voting yes were 51 Democrats and 10 Republicans.
   Voting no were 2 Democrats and 35 Republicans.

<HEAD>Highlights of Catastrophic Health Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some highlights of the House-Senate
compromise catastrophic health insurance bill.
   HOSPITAL _ Full coverage for 365 days a year of hospital bills
after a once-a-year deductible estimated at $564 in 1989. The
deductible is indexed to rising hospital costs. Medicare now
charges a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and
provides full payment for just 59 days a year.
   DOCTOR BILLS _ Full payment of ``reasonable and proper'' doctor
bills after a $1,370 annual cap is met. Medicare continues to pay
80 percent of charges, after a $75 deductible. Both the initial
deductible and the 20 percent patient co-payment will count toward
the $1,370 cap. Patient remains responsible for that portion of
fees that exceed the amount allowed by Medicare.
   DRUGS _ Medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs, after
a $600 annual deductible, starting in 1991. Medicare pays 60
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter,
with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs. Medicare
now has no across-the-board prescription drug coverage.
   COSTS _ To be paid solely by Medicare beneficiaries. Current
Part B premium of $24.80 to increase by $4 a month in 1989. By
1993, the ``catastrophic'' monthly premium is projected at $10.20,
in addition to whatever the regular Part B premium is at that time.
More than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by
an additional ``supplemental'' premium that is linked to federal
income tax liability. The supplemental starts at $22.50 a year per
$150 of tax liability in 1989, rising to $42 a year per $150 of tax
liability in 1993.
   NURSING HOME _ Expands number of days per year for skilled
nursing facility care from 100 days to 150 and reduces co-payment
from $67.50 a day after 20th day to $20.50 a day for first eight
days, then none. No provision for long-term custodial care.
   RESPITE CARE _ 80 hours per year home health services to relieve
unpaid care providers. This is a new benefit.
   HOME HEALTH CARE _ Expands present coverage of up to three weeks
of care per illness for five days per week to up to 38 days of care
per illness for seven days per week.
   HOSPICE CARE _ Expands present 210 days per year to 365 days per
year as long as patient is certified as terminally ill.
   MAMMOGRAMS _ A mammogram examination every other year for women
over 65. This is a new benefit.
   MEDICAID _ The bill phases in, over four years, a requirement
that state Medicaid programs pay all Medicare premiums, deductibles
and co-payments for the elderly and disabled with incomes below the
federal poverty line but too high to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
This improvement varies widely from state to state depending on
what the state already does.
   SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT _ Gradually raises the income that may be
retained by a spouse remaining in the community when the husband or
wife has to go to a nursing home at Medicaid expense. Starting Oct.
1, 1989, the spouse at home can keep at least $786 per month, or
122 percent of the federal poverty level for a two-person family.
Spouse also allowed to keep up to $12,000 in liquid assets.

   A part-time bodyguard for actor Sylvester
Stallone foiled a bank robbery after he spotted a suspicious
customer while driving by the bank.
   Skystone-Eagle Lambert, 34, was off duty Monday from his regular
job as a patrolman for the Santa Monica Police Department when he
noticed a bicyclist wearing a heavy black jacket, despite
temperatures in the high 60s.
   Lambert watched the man park his mountain bike in an alley
behind the First Interstate Bank of California in Gardena, 12 miles
south of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``We are trained to spot suspicious circumstances,'' Lambert
said. ``It's my police instinct.''
   Lambert followed his suspicions as the bicyclist got in line.
Lambert quietly warned bank officials about a possible robbery.
   The man handed a teller a note reading, ``Don't scream, I have a
gun, give me all your money or I will blow your head off,'' police
said.
   The teller handed the robber an undisclosed amount of cash, then
shouted ``We've been robbed!'' as the bicyclist ran out the front
door.
   Lambert ran out a back door. By the time the robber ran to his
bike, Lambert was waiting with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol leveled
at the suspect.
   The off-duty officer held the man until police arrived. Raymond
Jackson, 21, was booked for investigation of bank robbery and held
for the FBI, police said.

   Here are some questions and answers about the
House-Senate compromise catastrophic health insurance bill.
   Q: What's the purpose behind this legislation?
   A: To insure America's 32 million Medicare beneficaries _ most
of them elderly _ against financial ruin from a particular illness
or series of illnesses.
   Q: How does it do this?
   A: By setting a limit on the amount of money people covered by
Medicare will have to pay out of their pockets. Above that limit,
the government picks up the costs.
   Q: How is it financed?
   A: By the Medicare beneficiaries themselves.
   Q. How?
   A: Through a combination of flat monthly premiums on all
Medicare recipients and an additional supplemental premium that
works like an income tax surcharge _ it assesses those who can
afford to pay more.
   Q: But it's only the elderly who have to pay the higher tax?
   A: The elderly and about 3 million disabled people under age 65
who are covered by Medicare. The tax would be imposed if they have
enough taxable income to pay income taxes.
   Q: There are about 29 million elderly people. You mean their
taxes are being raised?
   A: Estimates are that about 60 percent of the people over 65
don't have enough income to pay income taxes and therefore will pay
only the higher flat monthly premium.
   Q: How much is that?
   A: In the first year of the plan, 1989, it is $4 a month. By
1993, the ``catastrophic'' monthly premium will be $10.20.
   Q: What about the tax for the other 40 percent?
   A: It varies according to income. For example, it starts at
$22.50 a year per $150 of federal income tax liability in 1989 and
rises to $42 a year per $150 of tax liability in 1993.
   Q: How much money does a person have to make before having to
pay the supplemental premium?
   A: The estimates are that individuals with incomes below $10,000
a year would not be subject to the supplemental premium _ or tax
surcharge if that is what you prefer to call it.
   Q: What do they get for their money?
   A: Medicare will pay full charges for 365 days hospitalization a
year instead of 60 days, as the law presently provides. There is a
one day deductible of $564 in 1989.
   Q: I have to pay that deductible every time I go in the hospital
now. Does that change?
   A: Yes. No matter how many times you are hospitalized from 1989
on, or for how many total days, you only pay one deductible a year.
   Q: How about doctor bills?
   A: Medicare will pay all ``reasonable and proper'' charges after
you pay out $1,370 from your own pocket in any given year.
   Q: That doesn't sound like an improvement. I only have to pay a
$75 deductible now before Medicare kicks in.
   A: That's true, but under the new plan Medicare still will pay
80 percent of your ``reasonable and proper'' charges after the $75
deductible. Under the expansion, the $75 you pay up front and your
20 percent share will count toward your $1,370 annual ``cap.''
After that, Medicare pays 100 percent of ``reasonable and proper''
charges.
   Q: ``Reasonable and proper'' _ that sounds like some kind of
loophole.
   A: It is important to understand what that means so you won't be
surprised by a big bill Medicare won't pay. Medicare has a set fee
schedule for every kind of treatment provided by doctors, and your
doctor knows what that fee is. However, many think it is too low
and charge their customers more than what the government thinks is
``reasonable and proper.'' If your doctor is one of those, it is
between you and him or her to settle up on the amount Medicare
won't pay. An increasing number of doctors accept Medicare as
payment in full and the government is trying to push even more to
do so.
   Q: Didn't I hear something about a new prescription drug benefit?
   A: Yes; there will be a general prescription drug benefit for
the first time since Medicare was set up 23 years ago. Medicare
will pay half of outpatient drug costs, after a $600 annual
deductible, starting in 1991. Medicare pays 60 percent the
following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter.
   Q: Anything else new?
   A: Effective in 1990, Medicare will pay for a mammogram every
other year for women 65 and older and at various intervals for
younger women covered by Medicare.
   Q: I hear this bill does nothing for people who have to go into
nursing homes.
   A: That's correct, if you're talking long-term custodial care,
the sort of situation in which an elderly person too frail to live
alone _ but not necessarily needing hospitalization _ goes to a
nursing home.
   Q: What other kind is there?
   A. What is called skilled nursing home care where a person needs
special care to recuperate from a serious illness.
   Q: What does this bill do in that area?
   A: Expands the number of days covered from 100 days to 150 days
per year. And the person covered no longer will have to spend at
least three days in a hospital before becoming eligible.
   Q: Anything else?
   A: Yes. Instead of having to pay $67.50 per day for each day
beyond 20 days out of his own pocket, as is the case now, after
1989 the person will have to pay $20.50 a day for the first eight
days and the next 142 days are free.

<HEAD>Vonnegut Says Play Not A Political Statement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years after ``Happy Birthday, Wanda
June'' opened off-Broadway, author Kurt Vonnegut says he's glad the
play is no longer seen as a political statement.
   ``When the play opened, there were strong divisions about the
Vietnam War,'' said Vonnegut, 65. ``It was a confusing time. Today
it stands as a play and not a political statement, and I much
prefer it that way.''
   Last year, director Joe Abramo told Vonnegut the Rocky Mountain
Theater Guild planned to stage ``Wanda June'' in Denver. It was
scheduled to open today at the University of Denver.
   ``I envisioned him coming here to do some kind of workshop,''
Abramo said. ``He told me he had been on the road for many years
and was staying away from that. But he was happy that someone was
doing the play.''
   In ``Wanda June,'' a swaggering adventurer and male supremacist
named Harold Ryan returns from eight years in the Amazon rain
forest, having missed the 1960s altogether. His wife, Penelope,
believing Harold was dead, had formed a romantic attachment with a
pacifist.
   When Harold's roughneck values clash with her new love's
peacemongering, Penelope is forced to confront her feelings for
each man.
   The original production of ``Wanda June'' received mixed reviews
and was closed early because of an actors strike.
   ``It had the life it deserved,'' Vonnegut said. ``Novelists
aren't good playwrights anyway.''

   Guests evacuated the downtown 34-story
Fitzgeralds Casino-Hotel after a carelessly discarded cigarette
ignited a pile of linen on the 24th floor, officials said.
   There were no injuries among the hotel's occupants, who
evacuated without incident shortly after noon Wednesday, but one
firefighter was hurt when a high-pressure hose snapped and struck
his head.
   A hotel employee discovered the blaze shortly after noon, and
fought it with a hand-held extinguisher until firefighters arrived,
said Evert Wilson, a fire department spokesman.
   Wilson said the fire began in a service elevator area when
someone discarded a cigarette onto the linen, but the fire never
got hot enough to activate the resort's automatic sprinklers.
   Hotel spokesman Fred Kosik said 98 percent of the hotel's 655
rooms were rented, but he didn't know how many people were actually
in the hotel, the state's tallest building.

<HEAD>Thousands Attend Funeral of Ethiopian Archbishop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABEBE ANDUALEM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Teklehaimanot, the
former barefoot monk who led Ethiopia's 20 million Orthodox
Christians through the turbulent transition from feudal empire to
Marxist state, has died. He was 70.
   State television and radio gave unexpectedly long coverage to
Teklehaimanot's funeral Wednesday, including a half-mile procession
with much pomp through downtown Addis Ababa to Trinity Cathedral
for the Requiem.
   Thousands of weeping Ethiopians laid flowers on his coffin.
   Memorial services have been held across this East African nation
for the patriarch, who died Sunday night after an undisclosed
illness.
   Teklehaimanot dedicated his life to missionary work in primitive
rural areas and was more at home shepherding his peasant converts
than with the pomp of high church life.
   He was elected patriarch in June 1976 at a time when the new
military government was attacking the church for its opposition to
change.
   Significantly, the former Father Melaku chose the name
Teklehaimanot, which means ``the tree of faith.''
   Teklehaimanot replaced Archbishop or ``Abune'' Tewoflos, an
urbane and widely traveled man who was detained in February 1975,
five months after a Marxist clique of army officers overthrew
Emperor Haile Selassie.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government never brought
charges against Tewoflos, whose fate is unknown.
   After Teklehaimanot was elected patriarch, the government
continued its onslaught against the church, nationalizing its vast
lands and buildings.
   The government gave the church a modest annual budget, but
Ethiopians flocked to church in the millions after the revolution,
attendance was at an all-time high and most parishes were
self-supporting.
   Anecdotes spread overnight that the new patriarch had difficulty
wearing his new shoes and was more comfortable in the rough yellow
kaftan of a monk than the fine robes of a prelate.
   Within months of his election the frail, sad-faced monk was
accepted as a humble and dedicated churchman whose ambition was to
guide his adherents through the turbulent times without
confrontation with the new military rulers.
   Teklehaimanot involved the church in relief work in
drought-stricken areas and often weeped openly when he preached of
the plight of famine and drought victims.
   Nearly half of Ethiopia's 44 million people belong to the
Orthodox Church while the remainder are mostly Moslems.
   Teklehaimanot was born into a poor farming family in northern
Showa province. He proselytized in remote parts of southern Sidamo
region, bringing Christianity to an area where paganism was
widespread.
   Christianity was introduced to Ethiopia in the 4th Century by a
Syrian boy called Frumentius, who converted the king, Ezana.

<HEAD>Parliament Votes To Begin Unplugging Nuclear Energy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweden became the first nation to
endorse a program to rid itself of nuclear power as its Parliament
voted to unplug two nuclear reactors by 1996.
   The bill, adopted Tuesday, set the timetable for dismantling the
first of Sweden's 12 reactors and established a mechanism for
deciding when to shut down the others within 21 years.
   The bill passed with support of 160 of Parliament's 349
legislators, but 70 others voted against and 82 abstained. The rest
were absent.
   Under the law, one reactor will close in the Barseback complex
in southern Sweden and another in Ringhals on the western coast.
   Swedes voted in a 1980 non-binding referendum to dismantle
nuclear energy by the year 2010.
   Though the power stations have proven safe and provided cheap
electricity, Energy Minister Birgitta Dahl said ``it is a matter of
honor'' to keep the referendum's promise.
   But doubts remain about the wisdom of the public's decision,
taken in the heat of worldwide debate following the nuclear
accident at Three Mile Island. The plant near Harrisburg, Pa., was
damaged in March 1979 after a combination of human and mechanical
errors led to a partial meltdown of the nuclear core.
   Sweden's first reactor was built in 1971, and the final two were
installed five years after the referendum.
   Nuclear power provides half the energy needs of Sweden, a
country slightly larger than California with a population of 8.4
million.
   Dismantling the two reactors could cost $800 million and the
nuclear plants will probably be replaced with coal or oil-fired
stations, according to Vattenfall, the government's energy agency.
   Swedes now pay about three cents per kilowatt hour, which means
an average household pays about $30 a month for electricity,
including heating during the long, frigid winters.
   Fear of expensive bills has prompted some industrialists and the
largest trade unions to voice reservations about eliminating
nuclear power.
   Critics of the nuclear shutdown also say dirty, fossil-fuel
energy that replaces atomic power will threaten Sweden's pristine
forests and hundreds of thousands of clear lakes.
   But Sweden was hit badly by the 1986 Chernobyl accident, costing
the authorities $84 million to compensate reindeer herdsmen and
farmers for contamination and to counter other effects, said the
Radiation Protection Board.
   The government plans new investment in hydroelectric power, oil,
gas and coal plants and in wind power. A government committee is
investigating the possibility of placing hundreds of 300-foot-high
windmills off the island of Oland, in the Baltic Sea.

   Pop singer Whitney Houston gave Rome an unscheduled
performance as she soaked up the sun on a hotel balcony, drawing an
audience of cheering fans, including Olympic skiing champion
Alberto Tomba.
   Ms. Houston, in Rome for a concert, was spotted sunbathing
Wednesday in shorts and a T-shirt with her legs dangling from the
hotel's second-floor balcony on the central Via Veneto.
   Italy's state television alarmingly reported on the midday news
that there were rumours she was going to jump.
   Meanwhile, cheering fans gathered outside, shouting ``sei

   Tomba, in Rome for a tennis tournament, heard the shouts from
his fourth-floor room and thought the ovation was for him.
Realizing his mistake, Tomba joined in the cheering.
   The commotion also attracted police officers standing guard at
the nearby U.S. embassy. The police, who said they feared for the
singer's safety, dispersed the crowd and asked Ms. Houston to
return to her room.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher got an explosive
surprise when she fired a laser beam to set off fireworks at the
groundbreaking of an amusement park.
   The fireworks spelled out the name of the park, The Battersea,
accompanied by a huge bang and blue smoke.
   ``They could have warned me,'' joked Mrs. Thatcher, who was
wearing a hard hat for Wednesday's ceremony at a former power
station that will be converted into the Disney-style park.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the $360 million park on the south bank of
the River Thames would create 4,500 jobs and is expected to attract
4 million visitors in its first year.

shouts of ``Bravo, bravo!'' after each led a 200-member orchestra
in a concert capping the U.S. orchestra's tour.
   Wednesday evening's performance drew thousands of Muscovites,
who huddled under umbrellas in showers at Gorky Park.
   The covered stage resembled a checkerboard of musicians, with
the Soviets from the State Symphony Orchestra of the Ministry of

   ``May we thank you on the last day of our tour for your
incredible hospitality and the warmth of your public that we will
not forget for a long time,'' Mehta told the audience.

   Derek Walcott, the Caribbean poet and playwright
who has given pungent voice to themes of cultural identity and
assimilation, was awarded Queen Elizabeth II's Gold Medal for
Poetry, the first Commonwealth writer ever to win the prize.
   Walcott, who is in his 50s, was born in the former British
colony of St. Lucia. He has written eight volumes of poetry and
more than three dozen plays, and also teaches English at Boston
University.
   Walcott, whose writing draws on such disparate poets as T.S.
Eliot, Andrew Marvell and W.H. Auden, a list of recipients who have
included Norman Nicholson and Britain's current poet laureate, Ted
Hughes.
   A six-person committee headed by Hughes and including the Irish
poet Seamus Heaney awarded Walcott the prize Wednesday. It has been
given periodically since King George V made the first presentation,
in 1933.

   Former Gov. Ray Blanton, who served two
years in federal prison in a liquor license conspiracy case and is
now seeking a congressional seat, plans to marry for the second
time, an aide said.
   Blanton, 58, is to marry Karen Flynt of Washington, a former
staff member of the Appalachian Regional Commission, said Charlie
Burns, Blanton's campaign treasurer.
   Burns said Wednesday he did not know when or where the wedding
would be, but the Nashville Banner reported the ceremony would be
today in Washington.
   Blanton and his first wife, Betty, divorced in April.
   The ex-governor is running for the Democratic nomination for the
seat of U.S. Rep. Ed Jones, a Democrat who is retiring.
   Blanton served the prison term for his 1981 conviction on
charges of mail fraud, extortion and conspiracy in connection with
the issuance of 12 liquor licenses to his friends. A U.S. Supreme
Court ruling led to a judge's vacating of the mail fraud charges.
Blanton is appealing the other charges.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus May Have Appeared 40 Years Ago, Study Suggests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A genetic study of the ``family tree'' of the
AIDS virus suggests it may have appeared only about 40 years ago,
scientists reported today.
   At most, the results suggest it probably evolved from its West
African cousin within the last 100 years, said researcher Temple
Smith.
   AIDS viruses are found in humans and monkeys, but the study
could not determine whether an ancestral virus jumped from monkeys
to humans, or vice versa, said Smith, director of the Molecular
Biology Computer Research Resource at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute of Harvard Medical School.
   The work follows a study published last week that suggested an
ancestral AIDS virus infected the primitive ancestors of humans and
monkeys more than 20 million years ago. Smith said he doubts that
conclusion.
   The new work, which used a different method of analysis, appears
in the British journal Nature. Smith wrote it with colleagues at
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico.
   It concerns the AIDS virus, called HIV-1, a West African
relative called HIV-2, and a monkey AIDS virus called SIV.
   Researchers focused on genes, which act as inherited blueprints,
for proteins from the coating of the viruses. They compared genes
from a total of seven samples of HIV-1 and HIV-2, plus two samples
of SIV.
   After defining similarities and differences that resulted from
the evolutionary history of each virus sample, they constructed a
family tree that would account for the similarities and differences
they found.
   To measure how fast HIV-1 was evolving, they compared a 1976
sample to others found during the 1980s.
   Results suggest that HIV-1 and HIV-2 split into separate
evolutionary paths at least 40 years ago, Smith said in a telephone
interview. And ``unless there is something very unusual going on,''
he said, the split must have occurred no more than 80 to 100 years
ago.
   Russell Doolittle, biology professor at the University of
California, San Diego, said the estimate made sense to him.
   Other researchers also have concluded the split in the human
virus occurred relatively recently, said Doolittle, who has studied
the evolution of the family of viruses that includes the one
causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Smith said the monkey virus also have split from the human
viruses 40 years to 100 years ago. But that assumes that the monkey
virus has evolved at about the same rate as the human viruses, and
no information is available on that, Smith said.
   Such a recent branching into human and monkey viruses contrasts
sharply with last week's study that suggests the split occurred
more than 20 million years ago, when humans and monkeys went their
own ways on the family primate tree.
   Smith said he doubted that various samples of the human AIDS
virus found so far would resemble each other so closely if a human
version had so much time to evolve into different variants.

   A woman whose 20-year accumulation of trash
and garbage in a rat-infested home forced authorities to move in
and clear away 40 tons of debris has died from a stroke. She was 72.
   Erleen Burman of Pomona was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical

stroke on Saturday, the hospital said.
   The Pomona Fire Department last month had ordered debris removed

   Miss Burman had entered into a house-cleaning contract with
Dennis Dewald, owner of D and J Screen Co., and Curnelius King Sr.

   Dewald said he plans to continue remodeling her kitchen free of

Burman.
   ``I liked her,'' he said. ``I'm not out for the almighty

   So far, he has installed a new subfloor and has ordered a new

<HEAD>Distributing Needles to Drug Users to Curb AIDS Worth Trying, D.A.
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first test of distributing
hypodermic needles to drug users for curbing AIDS will begin next
month in Portland, Ore., and the prosecutor says it's worth a try.
   ``I'm saddened we have a population that warrants such a
program, but I see there are valid public health and public policy
reasons for such a program, or at least putting it in place,'' said
Multnomah County district attorney Michael Schrunk.
   ``To me, the AIDS prevention and the drug treatment counseling
for each participant is really the key to it,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Such counseling may reach people who would not otherwise get it,
so it ``may well benefit the community,'' he said. ``I'm willing to
gamble the counseling will be good.''
   But Schrunk, who said he believed in a firm drug enforcement
policy, declined to say whether the program would break laws.
``Those are things we'll have to work through,'' he said.
   Legal opposition has been holding up a similar program in New
York City. In Massachusetts, state lawmakers on Wednesday debated a
needle distribution program in Boston.
   The Oregon project will be conducted by Outside-In, a social
service agency, under a $67,000 grant from the American Foundation
for AIDS Research, said Kathy Oliver, Outside-In's executive
director.
   The yearlong program, in which 125 drug abusers will get
counseling and exchange used needles for new ones, is designed to
study whether such programs can reduce the spread of the AIDS virus
among drug abusers, said project consultant Don Des Jarlais of
Narcotic and Drug Research Inc., a non-profit New York foundation.
   A needle used by an infected person can infect the next person
who uses it. Besides providing sterile needles, exchange programs
provide opportunity for counseling about drugs and AIDS, said Des
Jarlais, who is also coordinator of AIDS research for the New York
State Division of Substance Abuse Services.
   He and other health officials said they knew of no other such
program in the nation.
   No starting time has been set for New York City's planned
program, which must wait at least until a state regulation allowing
it takes effect next month, said city health department spokesman
Sam Friedman.
   In addition, officials must complete ``delicate conversations
with law enforcement and prosecutorial people in New York City,''
he said.
   The city's special drug prosecutor in February declared that
dispensing the needles would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to a
year in prison.
   In Boston, the Legislature's Health Care Committee conducted a
hearing on a bill that would allow the city to set up a pilot
needle exchange for six months.
   Such programs have begun in Europe, but the idea has sparked
controversy in the United States.
   ``It does carry an implied message that government is condoning
the drug use, which we think is an inappropriate message for
youth,'' said Allan Randall of the National Federation of Parents
for Drug-Free Youth, based in Silver Spring, Md.
   But Des Jarlais said he believes the Portland program will send
the opposite message because of its drug counseling.
   To qualify for the Portland program, a person will have to admit
intravenous drug use, show identifiable injection marks and have a
needle to exchange for a new one. But no used needle will be
required the first time they get a new one.
   About 5 percent of the Portland area's estimated 7,000 to 10,000
intravenous drug users are thought to be infected with the virus
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Des Jarlais said.
   But that proportion could jump to 50 percent in a few years
unless effective action is taken, he said.
   Participants in Portland will be interviewed and their blood
tested periodically. Results will be compared to members of a
second group of drug injectors, recruited from 11 other cities and
matched to the participants for such characteristics as race, age,
and the period since the person began regular injections.
   A third group will be 125 people seen at Outside-In who have
histories of using non-injected drugs. They will be compared to a
fourth group of similar size, from New York City, of people who do
not inject drugs but are high risk for starting injections because
of their use of heroin or cocaine.
   Both non-injecting groups will receive limited AIDS education
and counseling. They will be included to see if needle programs
encourage non-injectors to start intravenous drug abuse, a prospect
most experts doubt, Des Jarlais said.

<HEAD>Arafat Asks For Support For Uprising; Arab Summit Does Not Respond</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat asked Arab
leaders for more support for Palestinian protests in Israeli-held
territories, and Jordan's King Hussein blamed the United States for
the Middle East deadlock.
   Despite Arafat's plea Wednesday, delegates from 20 nations at
the Arab League summit did not immediately extend new financial aid
for the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Summit sources said Arab leaders were discussing financial
support for the uprising in the range of $300 million to $400
million to compensate for loss of income caused by strikes.
   But nothing had been done about by Wednesday evening.
   The three-day summit opened Tuesday to discuss ways of backing
the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, in which more than 200 Palestinians have died.
   Hussein, speaking behind closed doors to the leaders of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and the Arab nations, endorsed
some aspects of Secretary of State George P. Shultz's Middle East
peace plan.
   But he accused the United States of dragging its feet on a
Middle East peace settlement.
   ``The United States has no Middle East policy other than support
for Israel,'' Hussein said.
   Hussein, who lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 war, urged
Arab states to keep up the pressure on Israel by encouraging and
subsidizing the continuing Palestinian revolt in the occupied
territories.
   The king renewed his endorsement of the PLO as the Palestinians'
``sole legitimate representative'' and said he would not be
involved in any peace process that did not include PLO
participation.
   Aides distributed copies of his speech to reporters.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi meanwhile angered some
delegates by telling Arab leaders who collaborate with the United
States that they undermine the Arab cause and should ``go to
hell.'' He did not refer to any leaders by name.
   Gadhafi wore a white glove on his right hand, and one Libyan
delegate said the glove was intended to ``avoid contact with a hand
that shook that of (Israeli Foreign Minister) Shimon Peres.''
   Morocco's King Hassan II received Peres, then prime minister, in
July 1986.
   Hussein also said in his speech that if Arab leaders make the
establishment of a Palestinian state a condition for a peace
conference, then ``we shall not differ with them on that.''
   But he cautioned that such a stand, which conflicts sharply with
American and Israeli positions, may end hope for convening an
international Middle East peace conference.
   Egypt was not invited to the summit. It was suspended from the
Arab League in 1979 after agreeing to the Camp David peace accord
with Israel.

<TEXT>
   The cumbersome launchers and the
cruise missiles are lined up inside this U.S. Air Force base, the
anti-nuclear protesters remain outside _ and everybody is waiting
for the Soviet inspectors.
   ``They could do it today, I'm ready to go,'' said Col. William
E. Jones, an ebullient Tennessean who is the commander at Greenham
Common, 50 miles west of London.
   ``I have 29 launchers, I have 101 missiles. Everything I have is
for display,'' he said Wednesday.
   In the background, photographers milled round a 55-foot missile
launcher _ on show for the first time.
   U.S. military authorities lifted the veil at Greenham Common and
two other intermediate-range nuclear missile bases, at Florennes,
Belgium, and Mutlangen, a Pershing II missile base in West Germany,
ahead of the Soviet visits.
   The teams of up to 10 inspectors are due to arrive at 16 hours
notice sometime in July or August, implementing the first step of
the superpower accord to eliminate by 1991 the 2,700 land-based
intermediate range missiles both sides have deployed in Europe.
   The initial checks under the agreement ratified June 1 are to
inspect the missiles before they are dismantled.
   While Soviet inspectors visit 12 bases in five West European
countries and 14 in the United States, American teams have a
reciprocal right to check 133 sites in Eastern Europe.
   During the Greenham display, the launchers, which are scheduled
for destruction along with their missiles, trundled out of giant
bunkers ringed by four layers of rolled barbed wire _ then roared
through muddy lanes, showing off their paces.
   On the perimeter fence, a favorite target of protesters, hung a
banner with the slogan, ``Bread Not Bombs.'' A solitary woman
protester tried to climb the fence, but jumped back and disappeared.
   Outside a nearby gate, a dishevelled half-dozen group of women
protesters sat round a camp fire, a broken baby carriage and other
litter in the background.
   Women protesters have camped at Greenham since 1981 _ two years
before the cruise missiles arrived.
   On Wednesday, they said that they, or others, will still be
living in the tent and plastic camps here long after the missiles
have gone _ ever-suspicious that cruise missiles will simply be
replaced by something just as deadly.
   ``The Americans have a history of reneging on agreements,'' said
a young woman in her 20s, a former clerk who identified herself as
Xak Aroo.
   ``So they're going to take out the cruise _ it's no big deal. We
object to Americans being here anyway.''
   Inside the base, preparations have included fullscale rehearsals
_ mock inspections with Pentagon officials playing the part of
Soviet inspectors.
   ``The first group played very belligerent _ out of sorts Soviets
_ and we had to deal with that,'' said Lt. Col. Michael McCarney.
   ``The second group were what we expect _ very professional, very
businesslike Soviets and we found that ... you really could do the
inspection in two to three hours.''
   McCarney, project director for the inspection arrangements, said
he does not expect suspicion to cloud each Soviet visit.
   ``I think they are as anxious as we are to make this thing
work,'' he said.
   The fine print of the agreement means that the longest Soviet
teams can stay on any one inspection visit is 4{ days.
   The visitors will fly to Greenham and remain at the base _ or go
under escort to the second cruise base in Britain, at Molesworth,
near Cambridge, where 24 missiles are deployed.
   McCarney said he's laying on a few extra touches _ miniature
bottles of vodka and videos. He's also been collecting Sears,
Roebuck department store catalogues because, he said, that's what
Soviets who inspected a facility in San Diego recently took home.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill To Reinstate Limits on Kids' TV Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House-passed legislation would restore limits
to the amount of advertising during children's television programs,
a measure opposed by the Reagan administration as ``inimical'' to
free speech rights.
   Lawmakers voted 328-78 on Wednesday for the bipartisan measure,
which would limit commercials in children's programs to 10{ minutes
per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays.
   In a related action Wednesday, the Senate voted approval of a
bill designed to curb violence on television.
   That measure, sponsored by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., exempts
members of the television industry from federal antitrust laws for
three years to allow them to work together to develop voluntary
standards on TV violence.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote, moves to the House, where
the Judiciary Committee plans to hold hearings shortly.
   The FCC abandoned its children's TV advertising limits four
years ago on the theory that commercials would be regulated by
marketplace forces.
   The House-passed bill would give TV stations until Jan. 1, 1990,
to comply with new ad limits, and it would allow the FCC to modify
the time standards after Jan. 1, 1993.
   During debate on the bill, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said,
``For far too long, we have allowed children's television to be
driven solely by commercial considerations.''
   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo, R-N.J., ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said the measure ``strikes a balance between
financial support for children's programming and the desire to
shield children from overexposure to commercial messages.''
   Opponents say the measure is misdirected and raises
constitutional questions.
   An administration statement said: ``Attempts such as this one,
to inject the federal government into programming and advertising
decisions that are properly those of television broadcast
licensees, are inappropriate, ill-advised and inimical to the
spirit of the First Amendment.''
   The House compromise was stripped of earlier proposals to
prohibit programs that feature toy manufacturers' products,
referred to by critics as ``program-length commercials.''
   Legislation pending in the Senate would ban such programs. No
hearings have been scheduled on the Senate bill, which is sponsored
by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.

   A military transport plane crashed and
burned in a fireball Wednesday near the Greenville airport, killing
the six Air National Guardsmen aboard, authorities and witnesses
said.
   The aircraft, a big four-engine turboprop C-130 used to
transport troops and equipment, crashed about a mile north of the
airport around 2:40 p.m.
   ``I went down there but you couldn't get close to it,'' said
Reggie Kellems, whose family owns the field where the plane
crashed. ``No one could have come out that thing _ and didn't.''
   The aircraft was assigned to the 189th Tactical Airlift Group of
the Arkansas Air National Guard and was on a training mission, said
Maj. Jim Bates, public affairs officer at Little Rock Air Force
Base.
   ``They had been with us for some time doing touch-and-go
training landings,'' said Richard Brewer, air traffic manager at
the northeast Mississippi airport. ``The plane was in the pattern
and the first we knew something was wrong was when it impacted.''
   Witnesses said the plane appeared to veer to its left as it was
landing and crashed into a clearing near the runway. Military
authorities sealed off the area shortly after the accident.
   ``When I saw it, it was a just a big fireball,'' said Kellems.
   Another witness said the plane appeared ``to nose straight into
the ground'' and the tail and six or seven feet of the body of the
plane were the only sections left intact.
   Four bodies were recovered by late Wednesday and the remains of
the two others were believed under the wreckage, said Col. Dennis
Wood, another spokesman for the base.
   A spokeswoman for the Air Force Base, Airman 1st Class Deborah
Doyle, identified the dead as:
   Maj. Andries R. Zwaan, 39, a pilot with the 189th Tactical Air
Lift Group at the Arkansas Air National Guard based in Little Rock;
Staff Sgt. David Bingham, 24, a member of the 181st Tactical Air
Lift Squadron at Hensley Field in Texas; 2nd Lt. Mark R. Brandt,
24, of the 180th Tactical Air Lift Squadron at Rosecrans Municipal
Airport at St. Joseph, Mo.; 2nd Lt. Thomas D. Leece, 28, whose home
unit is the 934th Tactical Airlift Group of Minneapolis, Minn.; and
Master Sgts. Edwin J. Smith Jr., 35, and Danny W. Holland, 39, both
assigned to the 189th.
   Bates said a board of officers will investigate the accident.
   Bates also said it is not unusual for members of the Arkansas
Air National Guard to be on training missions out of state.
   The most recent crash of a C-130 stationed at Little Rock was in
March 1985, when a crash near Fort Hood, Texas, killed six crewmen.
   Prior to that, seven airmen were killed when a C-130 exploded
and crashed near Judsonia, Ark., on May 12, 1982, due to mechanical
failure.
   Officials said that prior to the 1982 crash, human error was to
blame for five crashes and mechanical malfunctions were responsible
for two crashes.
   Bates said the Air National Guard has nine C-130s in Arkansas.

   PLO underground leaders ordered Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip to observe a general strike today to
mark six months of rebellion against Israel's 21-year occupation.
   Meanwhile, the Arab mayor of the West Bank town El Bireh, who
was stabbed in the heart in an assassination attempt, called on
other Israeli-appointed mayors to defy demands by Palestinian
militants that they step down.
   ``Justice is on my side because I'm serving the people,'' Hassan
Tawil, 74, told Israel television from his hospital bed Wednesday,
a day after he was stabbed outside his office.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Arab militants have stepped
up attacks on Palestinian officials in the past three weeks and
offered the officials more protection, though telling Israel radio
``most can take care of themselves.''
   In two clashes near the West Bank city of Nablus on Wednesday,
troops shot and wounded four Palestinians, hospital officials said.
The army confirmed the shootings in the Balata refugee camp and the
nearby village Beit Fourik, but put the number of wounded at three.
   An Israeli driver suffered minor injuries when assailants threw
a firebomb at his car near the West Bank village Beit Ur Et Tahta,
the army said. Soldiers later clamped a curfew on the village.
   In a new leaflet issued this week, the United Leadership of the
Uprising, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization, ordered
Palestinians to shutter their stores and stay away from their jobs
today.
   Since the anti-occupation unrest began Dec. 8 in the lands
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war, 202 Palestinians and two
Israelis have been killed. More than 5,000 Arabs have been wounded
or injured and 5,000 are in jail.
   Tawil was reported in stable condition Wednesday night at
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital.
   In his first interview since the stabbing, he said he was
determined to stay on the job.
   ``They (the leaders of the uprising) should come and talk to us
and explain how to work. If we are against the people, we will go.
But I think we are helping the people. This is a message for
everybody,'' he said.
   Tawil also described the attack for the first time. He said a
stranger approached him, demanded a passport, and then stabbed him.
   Tawil was appointed mayor of El Bireh, a town of 10,000 about
nine miles north of Jerusalem, in 1986.
   About a dozen mayors and 85 village council leaders appointed by
Israel serve in the West Bank. The municipalities and village
councils provide local services and serve as a buffer between
residents and Israeli military authorities.
   ``In the past three weeks, most of the firebombs and other
violence have been directed against other Arabs,'' Rabin told
Israel army radio during a tour of the Gaza Strip.
   In other developments, the head of Israel's military
intelligence, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, said the Arab summit in
Algiers would have little influence on the uprising.
   ``I don't think (PLO chief Yasser) Arafat is waiting for Arab
summit decisions to run the struggle here,'' Shahak told Israel
television. ``What will happen (with the uprising) depends very
much on the residents themselves, on decisions they'll adopt
together with the PLO leadership.''
   Arafat had asked Arab leaders at the summit to help fund the
uprising.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India
said southern Asia will be threatened if fundamentalist Moslems
take power in Afghanistan.
   ``We see the biggest danger in Afghanistan of a fanatical,
fundamentalist government, which would be the worst possible
situation for our region,'' Gandhi told reporters Wednesday at the
end of a three-day visit to West Germany.
   Gandhi called for strict adherence to the Geneva accords, under
which Soviet troops are being pulled out of Afghanistan after
helping the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem rebels for
nine years.
   ``We would like the Afghans to dictate their own future. We
would like a non-aligned Afghanistan, and one that is not fanatical
and fundamentalist,'' Gandhi said.
   Asked what India would do if fundamentalists did come to power
in Afghanistan, Gandhi said: ``We do not contemplate taking any
action.''
   Gandhi also accused Pakistan of not cooperating fully with the
Afghanistan accords, but he did not elaborate.
   Pakistan, the United States, the Soviet Union and Afghanistan
signed the accords in April. The Afghan guerrillas have operated
out of bases in neighboring Pakistan.
   Gandhi criticized Pakistan for allegedly helping Indian Sikh
militants who have been staging terrorist attacks in India's Punjab
state.
   ``Pakistan today is perhaps the largest supporter of terrorism
in the world,'' he said.
   Gandhi also said India has no intention of building a nuclear
bomb, but that he would have to ``look again at our options'' if
Pakistan did develop a nuclear weapon.
   ``We have demonstrated our will not to make nuclear weapons,
although we have that capability, and we will do everything not to
go down that road,'' Gandhi said.

<HEAD>VA Finds No Conclusive Evidence of Agent Orange Health Effects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veteran's Administration says there is a
``growing scientific consensus'' that the herbicide Agent Orange
cannot be conclusively blamed for cancer and other illnesses among
Vietnam veterans.
   Thomas E. Harvey, the VA deputy administrator, told the House
Committee on Veterans' Affairs on Wednesday studies have
demonstrated no basis for the nation to compensate Vietnam veterans
based on their exposure to Agent Orange.
   He said none of the numerous studies on dioxin, the contaminant
in Agent Orange, has established that the chemical causes cancers
or illness among veterans or birth defects in their children.
   But he told the panel further research is needed as a result of
one study that showed an ``inconclusive'' association between
herbicide exposure and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of cancer.
   Harvey said the VA's Agent Orange Registry has now recorded the
results of physical examinations of 220,000 Vietnam veterans and
``still does not show any unusual health patterns'' among them.

   Deposits at savings and loans institutions
increased by $1.2 billion in April despite growing publicity about
federal bailouts and closings of troubled thrifts.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported Wednesday that April's
report was the seventh consecutive monthly increase and brought
deposits at the nation's 3,113 federally insured S&Ls to $962.4
billion.
   ``The steady deposit gains continue to indicate consumer
confidence in thrifts as a secure haven for funds,'' the bank board
said in a statement.
   The April deposit growth was less than the $4.3 billion increase
reported in March, but bank board economist James Barth said
deposit receipts normally decline in April as people pay their
federal income taxes.
   Net deposits during the first four months of this year totaled
$16.3 billion. Last year, there were $14.3 billion in net
withdrawals in the same period.
   So far this year, 37 institutions have been closed or, with
government assistance, merged into other S&Ls.

<HEAD>Bill Paves Way for Building Interstate Coal Pipeline</HEAD>

   A second House panel will consider legislation
designed to begin construction of an interstate coal pipeline now
that the House Interior Committee has approved the measure.
   The bill, approved 25-13 on Wednesday and sent to the House
Public Works and Transportation Committee, would grant a coal
pipeline company the power of eminent domain to enable it to
condemn land needed for the facility.
   The legislation, similar to a bill defeated by the House in
1983, is being pushed by coal companies as an alternative to what
they say are excessively high rates charged by railroads to haul
coal.
   Earlier this year, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee approved a version of the bill, which is awaiting action
by the full Senate.

   A black woman was holed up in a church a second
day today after being sentenced to jail for not testifying about
her daughter's alleged rape by whites, and a family adviser
insisted, ``We will never back down!''
   Glenda Brawley probably will not be arrested as long as she
remains in the Queens church, state Attorney General Robert Abrams
said Wednesday.
   ``That decision is in the hands of the sheriff,'' said Abrams,
the special prosecutor in the investigation.
   ``But I think he and I agree that if we charge that church
today, that would be precisely what the advisers for the Brawley
family would want in terms of their agenda and another chapter of
the media circus they have performed.''
   Mrs. Brawley, 33, spent Wednesday in the Ebenezer Baptist
Church, where more than 400 supporters gathered in the evening for
a prayer service, giving her a standing ovation.
   ``We will never back down! We will never give up! We will never
buckle under! We will never apologize!'' the Rev. Al Sharpton, one
of Mrs. Brawley's advisers, told the gathering.
   In Poughkeepsie, where a grand jury investigating the case met
again Wednesday, Abrams said: ``If Glenda Brawley chooses to exile
herself, confine herself, jail herself, in a particular church, and
she wants to do it for a day, 10 days, 30 days, that's her choosing.
   ``It's only going to be added to, and on top of, a 30-day
eventual jail sentence she will have to serve for her violation of
the court's order.''
   Dutchess County Sheriff Fred Scoralick refused to say what
action, if any, was being taken. On Tuesday, the department issued
a statewide arrest warrant for Mrs. Brawley.
   Sharpton said, ``We're going to stay here until the warrant is
killed.''
   Tawana Brawley, 16, disappeared for four days in November and
was found wrapped in a plastic bag about 10 miles from her
Wappingers Falls home.
   Some of her hair had been chopped off, animal excrement was
smeared and racial epithets were scrawled on her body.
   In sketchy interviews with authorities, she said she had been
abducted and sexually abused by six white men, one of whom had a
police-style badge. A hospital found no evidence of rape.
   Her mother was sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail for defying a
grand jury subpoena, but she had been given until Wednesday to
cooperate. Mrs. Brawley made no statements Wednesday.
   Sharpton and lawyers Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason say
Miss Brawley and her mother won't cooperate with the grand jury,
which they claim is biased against blacks.
   They have accused authorities of conspiring in a cover-up and
are demanding a new special prosecutor.
   ``We've got the facts and the evidence,'' Sharpton said during
the prayer service, addressing Abrams and Gov. Mario Cuomo. ``All
you've got to do is call our bluff and give us an impartial
prosecutor. Give us a prosecutor and tell us to put up or shut up.''
   Cuomo on Wednesday supported Abrams' handling of the case.
Referring to the Brawley advisers, he said: ``They say in effect no
black person gets justice in this state, and therefore they will
not participate.
   ``If they were to be utterly logical, then no black person
should ever pay a parking ticket, no black person should ever pay
their income taxes nor serve on a jury nor in any way participate
in this society. And that's an absurdity. I think most of this
state and most of the country recognize it for what it is.''
   The attorney general has said that if there is no cooperation
from the family the grand jury would likely wind up its
investigation in about a month.

   The Soviet Union has stolen the
disarmament show with a dramatic invitation to U.N. leaders to
witness the destruction of intermediate-range nuclear missiles on
its soil next month.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, speaking
Wednesday at a U.N. disarmament session, asked Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, members of the Security Council and
representatives of the 102-nation non-aligned movement to come to
the nuclear bonfire in July.
   It will be ``not the Bolshoi Theater, but a major premiere
nonetheless, a momentuous historic event,'' he declared.
   ``When the first public execution of weapons in human history
takes place, no one is likely to cry or weep. It will herald an end
to a lot of tears,'' he said. ``But having dug a grave for weapons
of mass destruction, mankind must now build the foundation of a
nuclear-free and nonviolent world.''
   Diplomats said Shevardnadze's speech was a tour de force that
put the United States on the diplomatic defensive.
   Even U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters praised the speech as
``hopeful, useful and good.''
   ``It was an extremely interesting new speech, it broke a lot of
new ground and it is deserving of study,'' he said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz plans to deliver a U.S.
statement before the 40-nation conference next week.
   But diplomats speculated that Vice President George Bush, or
even President Reagan, might make a last-minute decision to offset
the Soviet first-strike advantage and deliver a weighty American
rejoinder.
   ``The Soviet Union got on the stage first and kept up the
momentum of its view from the Moscow summit. They showed they are
in the forefront of the disarmament effort,'' said one U.N.
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They have made the
U.N. their forum.''
   The missiles will be among the first scrapped under the
now-ratified Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   In a news conference Wednesday, Soviet arms negotiator Viktor
Karpov said the destruction of the missiles would begin soon after
July 1. Under the treaty, all 2,700 land-based intermediate-range
missiles the superpowers have deployed in Europe are to be
destroyed by 1991.
   In his speech, Shevardnadze also invited the United States to
join the Soviet Union in banning all nuclear tests as the first
move toward ``a step-by-step elimination of nuclear weapons by the
year 2000.''
   And, for the first time, he said the Soviet Union would announce
the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on naval ships on
foreign port calls if the United States and Western allies do the
same.
   The United States has consistently refused to confirm or deny
whether its ships are nuclear-powered or carry nuclear weapons.
   Shevardnadze also called for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the Warsaw Pact each to reduce their forces by
500,000 troops.
   In August 1985, the Soviet Union commenced a unilateral nuclear
test moratorium, but the United States continued testing. The
Soviets ended their moratorium 1{ years later.
   ``On the basis of reciprocity with the United States, we are
ready to reintroduce and to observe it, this time not for a year
and a half, but for all times,'' Shevardnadze said.
   On conventional disarmament, the area in which NATO says the
Soviets hold a clear advantage in Europe, Shevardnadze proposed an
exchange of official data on troop strength, followed by on-site
inspections.
   This session, the third in 10 years, is debating disarmament
issues and will draw up a declaration of objectives and an
international action plan.
   Those attending include Prime Minister Noburo Takeshita of
Japan, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, President and Nobel
Prize winner Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, British Foreign Secretary
Sir Geoffrey Howe and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel.
   Shevardnadze also called for:
   _A global ban on chemical weapons.
   _Establishment of a U.N. agency that would coordinate and
monitor arms reduction agreements, verify compliance and monitor
the military situation in conflict areas.
   _Preventing the introduction of weapons into outer space and
establishment of an international space monitoring agency.
   _Restrictions on sales and supplies of conventional arms.
   _Limits on development of more destructive conventional arms and
new technologies, such as laser beams, genetic and electromagnetic
systems.
   _Including naval forces in disarmament negotiations.
   _Creation of U.N. naval forces of permanent Security Council
members. He proposed a joint trial in which the member fleets would
practice maintaining freedom of navigation by U.N. forces.
   The United States and many Western countries, which have naval
forces in the Middle East, have opposed a U.N. force as unworkable.

   The United States plans to urge its Western
European allies to use economic assistance to Eastern Europe as a
lever to bring about political reforms in the Soviet satellites, a
U.S. official said.
   The 16 NATO foreign ministers meeting here today and Friday plan
to focus on the outlook for Eastern Europe in light of Mikhail S.
Gobachev's push for reforms in the Soviet Union.
   Lord Carrington, the NATO secretary-general, said the alliance
has a great interest in the new Soviet policy of political and
economic change ``and what effect it will have on us.''
   The Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization holds its
semiannual spring assembly in Madrid on Thursday and Friday.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``Eastern Europe will be a testing ground for Gorbachev's
reforms.'' The official added that the United States will urge its
European allies not to aid Eastern European countries unless they
undertake substantial political reforms.
   The United States has been ``making the point all along that
economic reform is not going to work unless there is political
reform as well,'' the official said.
   The United States will be represented by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz; Alton Keel Jr, U.S. ambassador to NATO; and
Roseanne Ridgeway, the assistant secretary of state for European
affairs.
   No formal communique will be issued when the meeting ends
Friday, but Carrington said he would read a brief statement.
   East European nations in the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet bloc's
counterpart of NATO, are Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union.
   Carrington said the NATO ministers would also discuss arms
control and how NATO members divide up the cost of Western defense.
That includes transferring 72 U.S. F-16 fighter-bombers from Spain
to Italy, acceding to a Spanish demand that the fighter wing leave
its soil.
   The Council's meeting in Madrid is the first in Spain since it
joined NATO in May 1982.
   Spain is not integrated into the NATO military command in
accordance with a March 1986 referendum in which Spaniards also
voted to remain in NATO only on condition that U.S. military
presence in Spain be substantially reduced.
   The American official said the United States planned to tell its
allies it feels it is carrying the financial burden of NATO's
defense.
   He said Congress will probably seek a reduction in the 325,000
U.S. troops stationed in Europe unless this burden is more
equitably distributed.

<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old chemical poisoning lawsuit
ended with Monsanto Co. agreeing to pay $1.2 million to six of the
173 former workers who sued, but one who will share the award said
the money doesn't make up for his cancer.
   As part of the agreement announced Wednesday, Monsanto will pay
$200,000 each to the six retired employees who said their exposure
to a rubber additive at the company's Nitro plant gave them bladder
cancer.
   As part of the settlement, 127 dioxin-related claims and 34
other chemical poisoning claims will be dropped.
   In addition, the St. Louis-based corporation agreed to drop its
$300,000 court-costs claim against six other retired workers who
unsucessfully claimed the company recklessly exposed them to highly
toxic dioxin at the plant. Monsanto had attached liens to their
homes to guarantee payment.
   ``I'm pleased with it,'' said retired worker John Hein of the
$200,000 he will receive.
   But the Nitro resident said the money ``doesn't make up'' for
his illness, which sends him to a hospital twice a year for
treatments. He also said he was unhappy that the other plaintiffs
were left out of the settlement.
   ``There's a lot of them that the statute of limitations ran out
on. I don't like that,'' Hein said.
   Hein was one of the 173 former Monsanto workers who filed suit
in 1981.
   He was awarded $200,000 in 1985 after proving in an 11-month
trial that exposure to PAB, a rubber additive, caused his cancer
and that Monsanto knew the risk. However, it wasn't until
Wednesday's settlement that Monsanto agreed to pay the award.
   But he and six other retirees in the marathon trial lost their
dioxin poisoning claims, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected their appeal.
   It was after that trial that Monsanto sought to recover
$304,000, a fraction of its court costs, from the retirees. The
workers faced losing their homes if the chemical company prevailed.
   The settlement was reached a week before the scheduled U.S.
District Court trial of Hein and the five other bladder cancer
victims who will split the money.
   Attorney Stuart Calwell, who filed the original lawsuit against
Monsanto, said the six PAB-related claims were ``really all that's
left of the case.''
   ``I am very pleased for my clients,'' he said. ``I think for
them it's a very good settlement.''
   Added Monsanto lawyer Charles Love III: ``We're relieved, of
course, that it's over. We do not believe we injured these people
intentionally. However, rather than go through this again, we
decided to settle the matter.''
   Monsanto manufactured PAB at its Queeney plant in St. Louis and
shipped it to Nitro for manufacture into rubber chemicals. Calwell
said other Nitro workers exposed to PAB ``have a precancerous
condition'' but were not part of the lawsuit.
   Until 1983, West Virginia law allowed employees to sue their
employers for job-related injuries if workers could improve willful
and reckless disregard for their safety.
   Calwell said the case attempted to ``test the political
alignment of the courts in this country'' to determine how much
risk employers can expose workers to without losing protection from
civil suits.
   The federal jury hearing the dioxin claims found that the
chemical, a byproduct in Agent Orange production, was dangerous to
Monsanto employees' health. Dioxin has been linked to cancer. The
workers said they were exposed when the plant made the herbicide in
the 1950s and '60s.
   The jury ruled that the dioxin claimants failed to prove
Monsanto knowingly risked their safety. Monsanto then sought the
court costs.
   One of the dioxin plaintiffs, Lonnie Hurley, died in 1987 from
liver cancer that spread into his lungs, Calwell said. During the
trial, Calwell had tried to prove that Hurley's cancer was
attributable to his exposure to dioxin, while Monsanto lawyers
blamed it on Hurley's lifestyle, including his cigarette smoking.
   ``We had an autopsy done on Lonnie Hurley and sent out tissue
samples and those samples had dioxin in them,'' Calwell said.

<HEAD>Survey Says 8 Percent of West Germans Polled are Vehemently
Anti-Semitic</HEAD>

   Nearly 8 percent of West Germans
are vehemently anti-Semitic and a third believe Jews have too much
influence in the world, according to a survey sponsored by a Jewish
group.
   The survey, commissioned by the Anti-Defamation League of New
York's B'nai B'rith, said 15 percent of West Germans polled have
some prejudice against Jews. It said elderly men, rural people and
those with lower-level jobs made up much of the group.
   West Germany's respected Allensbach research and polling
insitute conducted the study last fall in conjunction with the
Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at West Berlin's Technical
University.
   Researchers planned to present the study formally at a news
conference today in Berlin. They made the written results available
to The Associated Press a day in advance.
   The pollsters interviewed 2,102 people over age 16 in West
Germany and West Berlin between Sept. 24 and Oct. 5, 1987, with a
standardized questionnaire.
   About 33 percent of those polled believe that Jewish influence
in the world is too high, but West Germans are not fearful of
Jewish influence in their own country, the researchers said.
   Only about 36,500 Jews remain in West Germany and West Berlin
after the Nazi Holocaust wiped out much of the European Jewish
population.
   ``Anti-Semitism after 1945 in the Federal Republic (West
Germany) is largely an anti-Semitism without Jews,'' the survey
report said. ``That means that anti-Semitism in the Federal
Republic always must be discussed in the context of the Nazi era,
the debate over the past and the question of guilt and
reparations.''
   The study said: ``Overall, just under 8 percent of the
population must be classified as vehemently anti-Semitic.''
   It added that 15 percent of the population demonstrated some
level of ``anti-Jewish prejudice.''
   ``This group is drawn in an above-average way from older men
above age 60, people in the lower education and job strata, and the
rural population,'' said the study.
   Violence and vandalism occasionally are directed against Jews in
West Germany.
   Before dawn on April 18, unknown attackers exploded a bomb
outside Frankfurt's Jewish Community Center. The blast caused
substantial damage but injured no one.
   Prosecutors speculate the bomb may have been in retaliation for
the assassination two days earlier of Khalil Wazir, the Palestine
Liberation Organization military commander.
   On June 4, vandals painted Nazi slogans and emblems on a new
stone memorial for Holocaust victims erected in the Saarland town
of Waldmohr.
   Federal officials in Bonn say there are about 1,520 neo-Nazis in
West Germany and that about 200 of them are considered ``militant.''
   West Germany continues to pay compensation to Jews and other
victims of the Nazis' terror. The total amount now stands at $48
billion and is expected to reach $60 billion by the turn of the
century.
   The survey did not address whether anti-Jewish feeling had
changed after Palestinian unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEAD>`Indian Joe' Leaves Legacy With His Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man they called Indian Joe lived
at Pickerel Lake for more than 40 years, steadfastly guarding his
precious 232 acres and refusing to sell to developers who promised
him fortunes.
   The death Sunday of Joseph ``Indian Joe'' Cizauskas marked the
end of an era in Kent County outside Grand Rapids, where some say
the property is worth millions to housing developers.
   Cizauskas, an eccentric loner who poured his earnings into
buying the land, apparently left no will. Though he was married
years ago, he has no children. What happens to the unspoiled
territory likely will be decided by a court, relatives say.
   ``It will likely have to be sold now. It's a shame someone
couldn't continue to use the land as he had,'' said Rose Kerr,
Cizauskas' niece.
   Cizauskas, who relatives say was about 80, was buried Wednesday
in Grand Rapids. And while the rugged-looking man with decaying
teeth and a wild thatch of hair may not have left a will, he did
leave a legacy.
   ``I think his appearance frightened some people, but I admired
him for what he stood for and for what he did,'' said Leonard
Weller, Cannon Township's clerk since 1969.
   ``All the material things in life didn't mean much to him _ the
houses, the radios and televisions, the clothes and fancy cars that
we all want _ those things didn't mean much to him. Only his
land,'' Weller said.
   Cizauskas lived at the end of a long dirt road in a two-room,
concrete-block-and-steel building that had electricity but no
plumbing. He built the place to be fireproof after his ramshackle,
wooden home mysteriously burned eight years ago.
   He lived on Social Security and retirement benefits from his
years of work in the tannery in Rockford.
   In the summer, he offered a day's fishing on his lake for 50
cents. In the late fall, customers lined up to select a $5
Christmas tree from the thousands of Colorado blue spruce he had
planted on the rolling land.
   Though Cizauskas' weathered features resembled those of an
American Indian, he was born in Lithuania. He attributed his
nickname to the children who visited him over the years from
neighboring Camp Roger.
   Though he seemed to enjoy his solitude, Cizauskas freely shared
his views on everything. Many of his favorite philosophies,
including his cure for inflation _ freeze prices _ could be found
on hand-drawn signs posted about his land.
   ``He wasn't really a hermit. He loved to talk to you for a few
minutes at a time, sharing his ideas. But he was never long in one
spot,'' Weller said. ``He was always right back to his land.''
   For the last 10 years, township secretary Ruth Hatt greeted
Cizauskas when he came to the township hall to pay his property tax
bill. He always made the trip in person.
   ``He knew he had to pay, and he never griped about it,'' Hatt
said. The property was valued at $122,200.
   In recent visits, Hatt said she noticed Cizauskas ``wasn't as
spry as he used to be.''
   But Cizauskas distrusted the medical profession, claiming he
hadn't been examined by a doctor in 30 years.
   Cizauskas once told a reporter he didn't care what happened to
the land or his body after he died.
   ``I'll tell you,'' he said, ``when I die you can take me out and
throw me on the garbage heap. When you're dead, you're dead.''

<TEXT>
   A four-month epidemic of hepatitis in Shanghai
has ended after more than 300,000 people contracted the disease and
30 died, an official newspaper said today.
   The China Daily quoted a Public Health Ministry official as
saying the daily average incidence of hepatitis A in China's
largest city has returned to a normal level of about 90 cases.
   The 311,938 cases were recorded between Jan. 19 and May 26, the
official said, adding that the epidemic began to wane in late March
and April after patients were put in isolation and restrictions
were put on the production and sale of clams, believed to be the
cause of the outbreak.
   The report said the spread of hepatitis had also been brought
under control in neighboring Jiangsu Province, after afflicting
70,453 people through May 10.
   In March, health officials also announced that 122,000 people
were infected and 650 had died in an 18-month epidemic of non-A,
non-B type hepatitis in the western region of Xinjiang.
   Hepatitis is caused by a virus transmitted in food and water and
is characterized by nausea, vomiting and fever.

<TEXT>
   Russian sailors danced in this
remote American outpost during a shore-leave blowout celebrating
the recent U.S.-Soviet fisheries agreement.
   More than 600 Soviet sailors, many clutching fistfuls of
dollars, arrived late Tuesday in this Aleutian Island town of about
1,900 people 800 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   They were treated to rock music, mounds of food and gallons of
various beverages, welcome sights and sounds for Soviet sailors who
had been at sea more than six months.
   ``This is the first time I meet Americans,'' said Alexander
Cherkov, first mate aboard the vessel Semiozernoye. ``Americans are
very nice people.''
   ``These people are real people,'' an American fisherman who
identified himself only as Captain America slurred as he staggered
off, his arms around two Soviet seamen. ``Just like you and me. Can
you believe it?''
   The party was held partly to celebrate the fisheries agreement
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed during
last week's Moscow summit meeting. The agreement allows U.S.
vessels to fish in Soviet waters and use Soviet ports, and joint
fishing and conservation in the North Pacific.
   Soviet seamen have been coming here for the past three years or
so, but Mayor Paul Fuhs said he could not remember when more
Soviets had visited at one time.
   ``This is great, just great,'' said a beaming Fuhs, who also
played with one of the rock bands. ``Where else could this happen?''
   Fuhs finished the evening with a red carnation tucked behind his
ear. ``It was one of those nights,'' he said.
   As the party picked up steam, a Soviet maritime officer in full
uniform tried to make his way across the windblown town dock jammed
with hundreds of dancing people, but was beseiged by giggling
children. He stopped, put down his coat and began playing games
with them.
   Soviet sailors showered toys, candy and other gifts on any child
in sight.
   Americans and Soviets struggled to converse, and traded pins,
hats and anything else not nailed down.
   While music blared from the rusty flatbed trailer that served as
a bandstand, the Soviets showed old flickering black-and-while
films of Lenin and Soyuz space launches on a screen dangling from
the side of a ship.
   Soviet sailors lined up to have their pictures taken with police
officers. Off to the side, a young Soviet seaman quietly played a
guitar for an American girl.
   By night's end, the sailors had to help one another back aboard
their vessels; many townspeople were in no better shape.
   ``The party was a success,'' Harbormaster Gary Daily said early
Wednesday. ``Everybody seems to have survived.''
   ``This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to
Soviet-American relations,'' said Dianna Matthias, lead observer of
the Soviet fleet for the National Marine Fisheries Service. ``I
never, never again want to hear that these people and Americans
can't get along.''
   ``I love these guys,'' said Ed Cameron, a fisherman from Tacoma,
Wash. ``This is the fishermen's summit. ... I could never raise a
hand or gun to any of them. If we ever have a war with them, I'll
be a conscientious objector.''
   The Soviets started coming ashore at Dutch Harbor for crew rests
around 1985, said Mark Dudley, Dutch Harbor manager of Maritime
Resources Co. International, a joint U.S.-Soviet fishing venture.
   ``Word spread like wildfire in the Soviet fleet,'' Dudley said,
yelling to be heard over the music. ``And every year after that
there have been more and more calls.''
   He said his company expects its Soviet vessels to make about 30
port calls by year's end. Town officials said they expect perhaps
10 additional Soviet ships.
   Each ship's crew is given up to $20,000 to spend here, Dudley
said.
   The sailors come ashore to buy American and Japanese goods.
Before the party, they descended on stores to stock up on such
goods as music tapes, portable radio-tape decks, solar powered
watches, ice cream and gum _ lots of gum.
   ``My kids call it hooba booba,'' said Alexander Mokhov, captain
of the Mys Chassavoi, a 285-foot fish processor. ``They want
nothing else. If the gum sticks to your hair, they know it is good
gum.''

   Attackers tried to assassinate Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni after hundreds of his soldiers mutinied
in April, Ugandan dissident military officers said.
   At least 200 mutineers of the 19th Artillery Regiment and the
8th Infantry Battalion were killed in clashes with 3,000 loyal
troops April 7-8 before rebel units surrendered, the sources said
Wednesday. The two units are based near the Ugandan capital of
Kampala.
   About 700 mutineers were captured and detained by military
police at Luzira prison in Kampala, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A presidential convoy was ambushed April 11 on the 22-mile
highway from Kampala to the State House in Entebbe. Mutineers
killed at least 16 military escorts when they fired on two of three
military trucks, the sources said.
   But Museveni was not traveling in his official bulletproof car.
He had flown by helicopter from Kampala to the State House and
evidently had sent the seven-vehicle convoy along the road without
him, the sources said.
   The attackers escaped.
   Military headquarters in Kampala ordered local journalists not
to report the mutiny, and several people were detained in the
capital for discussing it publicly, the sources said.
   The sources said they belong to a group of dissident officers
who want Museveni to hold peace talks with several rebel armies,
improve conditions for soldiers and expel 100 Libyan and 250 North
Korean military instructors from the former British colony in East
Africa.
   They said the mutiny and ambush were aimed at toppling Museveni.
   The military command in Kampala, contacted by telephone from
Nairobi, would not confirm or deny the reports.
   Telephones at State House alternately went unanswered or were
busy.
   No previous attempts to assassinate Museveni have been reported.
   Museveni seized power Jan. 27, 1986, ending a five-year bush war
against civilian President Milton Obote and the military junta that
ousted Obote in July 1985.
   The sources said the captives had not been ill-treated and would
be sent to re-education camps at Entebbe, Kyankwanzi west of
Kampala and Mobuku near the Zaire border. The government set up the
camps to screen surrendering rebels before they are absorbed into
the army or allowed to return to civilian life.
   Soldiers loyal to Obote and other toppled Ugandan leaders,
including military dictator Idi Amin, have mounted insurgencies
since August 1986 and Museveni's National Resistance Army has been
battling several rebel groups.
   On Saturday, Museveni signed a peace agreement with the
commander of the largest rebel group, Lt. Col. John Angelo Okello
of the northern-based Uganda People's Democratic Army. But Eric
Otema Allimadi, the rebels' leader in exile in London, rejected the
accord in advance.
   Museveni envoys are trying to negotiate a similar agreement with
a smaller rebel group fighting in the east, the Uganda People's
Army.

<TEXT>
   The first apparent example of an
Einstein ring, a celestial illusion predicted by the famed
physicist more than 50 years ago, has been discovered by
astronomers.
   They found an elliptical ring they believe occurs because radio
waves are bent by the gravity of a distant cosmic object. The
discovery, reported today in the British journal Nature, was made
by Jacqueline N. Hewitt of Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and other radio astronomers.
   The scientists believe the sighting is another example of a
gravitational lens.
   During the past decade, several other celestial mirages have
been spotted. A galaxy relatively close to Earth acts as a lens,
bending the light emitted by a more distant object. In most of the
other examples, the result has been the appearance of two objects
where only one actually exists.
   However, the latest probable gravitational lens is bending radio
waves, rather than light, into a ring.
   Albert Einstein speculated in 1936 that such things exist but
are too small to see. That was before the development of radio
astronomy.
   Hewitt's discovery was made with the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory's VLA, or very large array, telescope near Socorro,
N.M. It was based on observations in 1986 and 1987.

   A seven-week hunt for the Abominable Snowman in
the wilds of Tibet yielded strange footprints in the snow and the
remains of two skinned sheep but no proof that the mythical apeman
exists.
   A six-man expedition explored the 23,237-foot Menglungtse
summit, where British explorer Eric Shipton took his famous
photograph of a four-toed footprint in 1951.
   Since Shipton's photograph, there have been scores of alleged
sightings of a fearsome hairy beast, known both as Yeti and the
Abominable Snowman, with the characteristics of Neanderthal Man.
   But Chris Bonington, 53, leader of the expedition, told a news
conference Wednesday ``there's certainly not any conclusive
evidence one way or another'' that the legendary apeman exists.
   In a London radio interview, Bonington said the team's main
evidence consists of the skins of two mountain sheep known as
bharals that were found at 17,000 feet.
   The skins seemed to have been ripped cleanly off the sheep in a
manner inconsistent with any of its known predators.
   Bonington said Tibetans pass through the area where the skins
were found, but not at this time of year. In addition, the Tibetans
would have taken the skins because of their value, he said.
   He said one member of his team also found a ``very, very good,
very clearly distinct line of tracks that seemed to be of a biped.''
   The team is waiting for the film to be developed.
   Adding to the mystery was the sighting by British Broadcasting
Corp. film producer John Davidson of a dark figure at about 1,000
feet.
   ``My first impression was that it was probably a bear,''
Bonington said. But it didn't act like one.
   Finally, team members said they could not explain what happened
to ski poles that vanished after Andy Fanshawe, 25, and Alan
Hinkes, 34, buried them under a heavy pile of rocks.
   The team has turned over its evidence to London's Natural
History Museum for scientific tests.

<HEAD>Government Report Links Leukemia To Nuclear Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate of leukemia among young people living
near a nuclear complex in a barren area of northern Scotland is
nearly twice Britain's national rate, a report published today says.
   The report by the government-sponsored Committee on Medical
Aspects of Radiation in the Environment says six known cases of
leukemia were diagnosed among young people under 24 who lived
within 15 miles of the plant in Dounreay between 1968 and 1984.
   ``This is twice the number expected on the basis of the national
rate,'' the report says, adding that the likelihood of such a high
rate occurring by chance is about one in 12.
   Five of the victims lived within 7.8 miles of the nuclear
complex, the center for Britain's fast-breeder reactor research
program, the study says.
   The report says the reason for the number of leukemia cases is
not known, though the findings echo a 1986 government investigation
showing the childhood leukemia rate near the Sellafield nuclear
reprocessing plant in Cumbria, northwest England, to be four times
the national average.
   ``It is hard to imagine that you could see an excess around
Dounreay and an excess around Sellafield, and it is just bad
luck,'' said commission chairman Martin Bobrow.
   The committee said it was ``conceivable that minute amounts of
radioactive material carried home may accumulate and lead to
exposure of infants in some unforeseen way.''
   But it said the level of leukemia might also be due to exposure
to chemicals, viruses or even chance.
   Scottish Health Minister Michael Forsyth said the government had
accepted the committee's recommendation to hold an investigation
into the high rates, despite the``small number of cases involved.''
   However, union spokesman Bryan Durrans of the Institute of
Professional Civil Servants called the report ``inconclusive.''
   ``If most of us thought anything was likely to happen to our
children or families, we would not be here.'' he said.
   The Dounreay complex employs 2,100 workers in a barren area of
Northern Scotland that offers little alternative employment.
   The environmental group Friends of the Earth lauded the report
as the first government admission of a link between leukemia and
nuclear emissions, and called for an immediate closure of both the
Dounreay and Sellafield plants.
   ``The nuclear industry has finally been implicated in causing
cancers _ something it has denied for years,'' said spokesman
Stewart Boyle.
   Leukemia clusters _ occurrences of the disease statistically
higher than normal _ have also been found in southern England near
the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, the Royal Ordnance
Factory and the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority.
   In each case, scientists in the nuclear industry argued that
recorded emissions of radiation were not high enough to account for
higher rates of the radiation-linked disease.
   The national leukemia rate is eight cases per 100,000 people.

<TEXT>
   Police today stepped up a search for
at least three members of the Japanese Red Army terrorist group
after the deportation of another member suspected of plotting to
disrupt the Olympics.
   Hiroshi Sensui, 51, was deported Wednesday after his arrest at a
Manila clinic where he had undergone plastic surgery.
   Japanese officials said Sensui was serving a life sentence for
murder and robbery until he was freed in 1977 in exchange for
hostages aboard a Japan Air Lines jet hijacked in Bangladesh.
   Morishi Aoki, an official at the Japanese Embassy, said two
other members of the leftist terrorist group were believed living
in the Philippines. A third, Noruyo Zasaki, lives in Singapore but
regularly visits here, Aoki said.
   Immigration Commissioner Miriam Defensor-Santiago told foreign
reporters Wednesday that her department was redoubling its efforts
to track down Red Army members ``so we can make similiar arrests.''
   She said intelligence agencies believed Sensui and other Red
Army members were plotting attacks on the Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea, from a base in Manila.
   Another member, Osamu Maruoka, told police last November that
the Japanese Red Army had a ``sleeper agent'' in the Philippines,
police said.
   Police said Sensui entered the Philippines in 1984 under the
name Noboru Yamaguchi, married a Filipino woman and introduced
himself as a businessman.
   The couple lived in suburban Paranaque until last November, when
they moved to a hotel in Manila's Chinatown district. Police had
begun searching for Sensui but lost track of him until he surfaced
Tuesday in the Makati Medical Center.

<TEXT>
   France will wipe out a third of the debt owed to it
by the world's poorest nations and has proposed that the world's
six other major industrial powers do the same, an aide to President
Francois Mitterrand said.
   Mitterrand set out his proposal in a letter sent to the six
other leaders with whom he will be meeting at the Toronto economic
summit June 19-21, special counselor Jacques Attali said Wednesday.
   ``It has never been so urgent and so necessary to act to help
the countries of the Third World, while the gap between rich
countries and poor countries continues to grow,'' Mitterrand wrote.
Excerpts of the letter were made public by his office.
   Mitterrand, President Reagan and the leaders of Canada, Britain,
West Germany, Italy and Japan will be present for the annual
three-day meeting.
   France is proposing that the seven summit nations agree to take
one of three approaches:
   _ Consolidate existing debt at market rates of interest, but
extend repayments over 25 years rather than the current norm of 20
years.
   _ Consolidate the debt at a preferential interest rate of no
more than half the market rate, but with repayments over about 15
years.
   _ Forgive one-third of the total public or government-guaranteed
commercial debt, with the rest consolidated at normal market terms.
   ``It's a very new procedure,'' Attali said. ``With its menu of
options, it gives us reason to hope for a consensus.''
   Whether or not the summit partners agree, France intends to go
ahead with the first option, wiping out one-third of the debt.
   Attali refused to specify how much money was involved, beyond
saying the amount is ``not just in the hundreds of millions of
francs.'' At current exchange rates, 100 million francs is about
$17.2 million.
   He declined to identify the countries that would be eligible,
saying only that they numbered about 20. To qualify, a nation must
be extremely poor, deeply in debt and in the process of improving
the management of its economy, he said.
   Among France's biggest debtors are its former African colonies.
   The Mitterrand plan would not apply to the world's most indebted
nations, such as Mexico and Brazil, because they are not among the
poorest. The president said such countries must also be aided, with
new resources and inventive techniques.
   Attali said France will be represented in Toronto by Mitterrand
and Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy.

   A ``peace convoy'' was stalled at the
Mexican border by trade restrictions, but organizers say the 41
vehicles carrying food and medical supplies for Nicaragua won't
budge until they are allowed to cross the Rio Grande.
   ``Right now, we're prepared to stay here until we are allowed to
leave our own country,'' said Gerry Condon, one of the nearly 100
participants in the Veterans Peace Convoy to Nicaragua.
   ``We feel like we are being held hostage with this humanitarian
aid.''
   The group held a closed meeting Wednesday night at its Laredo
campground base to plan actions ``that would be dramatic, that
would up the ante,'' said Condon, a Vietnam veteran from Santa
Cruz, Calif.
   They marched Wednesday through Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, just across
the river, carrying signs and chanting slogans, then briefly
blocked one of the international bridges with Mexican supporters.
   New York lawyer Stephen Somerstein, traveling with the convoy,
said attorneys with the New York-based Center for Constitutional
Rights are representing the convoy in its negotiations with the
Treasury Department.
   Somerstein said he expected demonstrations of support around the
country, including a protest planned today at the federal building
in San Francisco.
   Convoy organizers, who oppose the U.S government's trade
restrictions against Nicaragua and aid to the Contras who have
fought to overthrow the leftist government, had planned to cross
the Mexican border Wednesday morning.
   They had hoped to reach Nicaragua on June 18.
   But on Tuesday night, federal officials advised them that
although the food, clothing and medical supplies would be allowed
to be taken to Nicaragua, the vehicles they planned to leave in the
Central American nation for distribution of the aid would violate a
trade embargo.
   The Nicaraguan Trade Control Regulations of the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibit the
unlicensed export of goods to Nicaragua, except for ``donated
articles such as food, clothing and medicine, intended to be used
to relieve human suffering.''
   In order to take the five buses and 36 trucks and cars to
Nicaragua, the Treasury Department said, the convoy would have to
post bonds equal to the value of the vehicles as assurance that
they would be returned to this country.
   The group also would have to return them to the United States
within 30 days or face forfeiture of the bonds and other federal
penalties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,
according to a notice the department gave to convoy members.
   ``We do not plan to bring them (the vehicles) back,'' said
convoy member Dave Silk, from Stonington, Conn. ``That's part of
our humanitarian aid.''
   Convoy organizers say the vehicles are needed in Nicaragua so
private relief agencies can distribute the donations. The 150 tons
of aid, including food, concentrated milk, diapers, hospital beds,
toys and bicycles, is for children, they said.
   Customs officials said they took the initiative Tuesday night to
tell the convoy about the regulations, and maintained that the
group was not being harassed.
   ``It's a very usual, ordinary and customary procedure,'' said
Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman in Houston. ``All they are
doing is going through our usual export control procedure.''
   The convoy started May 21 from points in the West Coast, the
Rockies, Midwest and East Coast.
   By the time it reached the border Tuesday night, it included 55
veterans from World War II, Korea and Vietnam, as well as 39
supporters.
   ``As long as the Reagan administration wants to have veterans
sitting here with baby food on the border, that's how long we'll be
here,'' said Condon.

   Palestinian guerrilla factions battled
each other in two Beirut refugee camps during the night, leaving
two dead and 10 wounded, police said today.
   Guerrillas from Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, the main
component in the Palestine Liberation Organization, fought a
breakway Syrian-backed faction, the Fatah-Uprising led by Col.
Saeed Mousa, police reported.
   The two groups battled with howitzers, mortars, rocket-propelled
grenades and machine guns in the Bourj el-Barajneh and Chatilla
camps, police reported.
   Mousa's gunners deployed in mountains overlooking Beirut shelled
Arafat's followers with howitzers.
   The fighting ended at daybreak after a cease-fire worked out by
several Palestinian factions took effect.
   Mousa broke from the PLO in 1983 and set up his headquarters in
Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   Fatah and Mousa's faction have clashed repeatedly in recent
weeks, despite moves by Arafat, the PLO chairman, and Syrian
President Hafez Assad to reconcile after a five-year feud.

<TEXT>
   The woman behind some of the biggest hits of the
Fifth Dimension, singer-songwriter Laura Nyro, is returning to the
concert stage after 10 years.
   Why?
   ``I quit smoking last summer,'' she told the Daily News. ``It
made my instrument very rich and stable. Also, whenever you quit
any addiction, your life is new again. You feel if you can free
yourself that way, you can do almost anything.''
   Nyro, 41, said her summer tour, which begins tonight in suburban
Rochester, is dedicated to the animal rights movement. She also
plans to record an album for Columbia Records to add to her others,
including ``Eli and the Thirteenth Confession,'' ``New York
Tendaberry'' and ``Gonna Take a Miracle.''
   Nyro was 17 years old when Peter, Paul and Mary popularized her
song, ``And When I Die.'' Other hits she has penned include
``Stoned Soul Picnic'' and ``Up, Up and Away,'' made famous by the
Fifth Dimension.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key indicator closed at
a record high today, and the U.S. dollar gained slightly against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues ended the day at
28,072.02, up 159.37 points or 0.57 percent, surpassing its
previous record close of 27,996.24 set Monday. On Wednesday, the
index slipped 54.67 points.
   ``The overnight surge on Wall Street gave Tokyo stocks a
boost,'' said a stock analyst with a major Tokyo securities house,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The New York Stock Exchange's Dow Jones industrial average rose
48.36 points to close at 2,102.95 Wednesday.
   It was the first time the Nikkei index has closed above the
28,000 mark.
   The analyst said apprehensions among some investors that the
market was rising too high promoted profit-taking that eased share
prices a little during the afternoon session.
   The Nikkei index ended the morning session at 28,148.77, its
highest level ever.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 2.6
billion shares, up from 1.8 billion shares traded Wednesday. It was
the heaviest volume this year, and near the market's record of 2.83
billion shares set in March 1987.
   Prominent among gainers were steel stocks and issues related to
domestic demand, including real estate and construction. Textile,
non-ferrous metals and machineries lost ground.
   In the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
125.43 yen, up 0.11 yen from Wednesday's close. It opened the day
at 125.55 yen, but never moved higher, ranging between 125.40 and
125.55 yen.
   ``Trading was quiet and the dollar moved very little, with a
lack of incentives to direct the market,'' said a currency dealer
at a major commercial bank in Tokyo.
   Many participants sat out the day's trading, awaiting the
release of U.S. trade figures for April, due out next week, the
dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Sikh militants fired a rocket at a base
of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force and killed one
policeman, the Press Trust of India news agency said today.
   Five policemen were injured in the attack Wednesday night on the
post near Amritsar in Punjab state, the news agency said.
   It was the fifth time this year the militants have fired a
rocket. Previous targets were a police jeep, a Central Reserve
Police barracks, a police patrol party and the house of a moderate
Sikh leader.
   Elsewhere in Punjab on Wednesday, Sikh militants killed two
people, both Sikhs, officials said.
   The killings raised to 1,270 the number of deaths in Punjab this
year from the Sikh militants' violent agitation for an independent
homeland.
   The victims have included at least 542 Sikhs who the militants
claimed were police informers.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are
in a majority in Punjab. Dissident Sikhs launched a campaign for an
independent homeland in Punjab in 1982, claiming discrimination by
Hindus, who comprise 80 percent of the national population.

   A 36-year-old jet skier has been charged
with manslaughter in the death of a woman who officials say was
literally scared to death when he zoomed by within inches of her on
Lake Lanier.
   Barbara Reyes, 40, of Norcross, who had a history of heart
trouble, was floating on an inflatable raft during an outing the
weekend before Memorial Day when she died.
   Gwinnett County Police arrested Adrian Stanoiu, 36, of Norcross,
on a misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter charge Wednesday. If
convicted, Stanoiu could face a year in jail. He was released on
$550 bond.
   According to police, Mrs. Reyes was enjoying a Sunday outing
with her husband and some friends at Lanier Park Beach near Buford
when Stanoiu began riding a motorized jet ski close to shore, where
several people were swimming and Mrs. Reyes was rafting.
   Her husband, Fermin Reyes, told police the skier refused to
leave when he tried to warn him away. His wife panicked when the
skier came within 6 inches of her raft, and she began paddling
frantically toward shore.
   She collapsed in a few inches of water and died shortly
afterward. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to have been a
cardiac arrhythmia brought on by fright, said Coroner Randy Simpson.

   It wasn't an easy climb for Carmen Hudson-White,
who grew up in a public housing project and struggled on welfare as
a single parent. But climb she did. On Sunday, she'll receive her
medical degree.
   And in July, the 41-year-old Ms. Hudson-White will enter the
residency program at the University of Illinois Medical School's
hospital.
   ``I've been very busy the last few years,'' said Ms.
Hudson-White, who is getting her degree obstetrics and gynecology
from the university.
   And she's watching proudly as her children follow her through
college, inspired by her. Her son, Joseph, 20, is a criminal
justice student at Chicago State, and her daughter, Charisse, 22,
graduates this month from the University of Illinois in Champaign
and will enroll at the University of Illinois College of Medicine
in the fall.
   ``My mother has been an inspiration,'' says Charisse. ``Even
though she was going to school, she was always there when I needed
her.''
   Ms. Hudson-White said she was separated and living with her
children in 1974 when she decided to resume her studies.
   ``Being a doctor has always been a goal,'' she said Wednesday.
``But I also wanted a family and decided to work on that first.''
   The family had to survive on welfare payments that gave them
enough for food and used furniture. Ms. Hudson-White got a
fellowship to cover her tuition.
   In 1979, she earned a bachelor's degree, and in 1981 a master's
degree in biology from Chicago State University. Then she began
applying to medical schools in Illinois and surrounding states _
only to be rejected again and again because of low test scores.
   ``At first I thought I was too old,'' she said. ``But my Medical
College Admissions Test scores weren't as good as they could have
been.''
   She took the test again in 1982, improving her scores, and
re-applied to the 20 schools. This time, most accepted her.
   ``I chose University of Illinois because it was home and cost
less than the others,'' she said. ``Besides, I had two children
still in high school and to start things anew whould have been a
real hardship both emotionally and economically.''
   Her medical school costs were covered by a scholarship from the
Illinois Department of Public Health. She also received a stipend
to cover living expenses.
   Although her children were used to her as a student, the
adjustments of medical school weren't easy for them, Ms.
Hudson-White acknowledged.
   ``My son was really used to having me do things mothers do,''
she said. ``He didn't make the adjustment as well as my daughter.
He would leave notes such as `A good mother would make dinner for
her children.' But we worked it out.''
   Karen Pike, a class coordinator at the school, says Ms.
Hudson-White has handled a difficult task well.
   ``In her junior year, she usually had to be in the hospital from
7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily and was on call three or four nights a
week,'' Ms. Pike said.
   Ms. Hudson-White says her goal is to have her own practice. But
first, she is committed to working three years in impoverished
areas, including the Altgeld Gardens housing project where she grew
up.

<TEXT>
   Two-time Tony winner George Rose, slain last
month at his Caribbean vacation home, was remembered by his friends
from the Broadway stage as a Renaissance figure, friend and teacher.
   Actress Betty Buckley, a co-star of Rose in ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood,'' moved many in the audience to tears when she sang
``They Can't Take That Away from Me'' at Wednesday's service at the
Shubert Theater.
   ``It reminds me of George, a time when things were gentler, more
elegant,'' she said in explaining her choice. ``George Rose was a
teacher of mine. He was the epitome of elegance and high standards.
I can only aspire to his standards.''
   Producer Joseph Papp, who worked with Rose on ``Drood,'' called
him ``a Renaissance figure, and it was all presented on the stage.''
   Rose won his second Tony for his role as the chairman in
``Drood''; his first was as Eliza Doolittle's father in a revival
of ``My Fair Lady.''
   Judy Kaye, who won a Tony on Sunday for ``The Phantom of the
Opera,'' called Rose ``one of the best actors who ever walked the
planet.''
   Others who appeared to sing or just reminisce included Jack
Gilford; Rupert Holmes, who composed ``Drood''; Maureen McGovern,
who played Rose's daughter for a year in ``The Pirates of
Penzance''; and Howard McGillan, who was in ``Drood'' and now is in
``Anything Goes.''
   Rose, 68, was born in England but lived since 1961 in New York,
nearly always working on Broadway. He was killed May 4 by his
adopted son and three people in the Dominican Republic, authorities
there said.

   Iraq said today its warplanes hit a ship
off Iran's Persian Gulf coast during the night, and Iran said its
interceptors shot down an Iraqi jet in a dogfight over the waterway.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said one civilian was killed and six wounded when Iraq
planes bombed a village near Sardasht in northwestern Azerbaijan
province Wednesday.
   The agency said the French-built Iraqi Mirage F-1 was shot down
and exploded over the gulf.
   There was no confirmation from Baghdad. But the official Iraqi
News Agency reported that Iraqi helicopter gunships shot down an
Iranian Bell 214 helicopter today over the northern sector of the
gulf war battlefront.
   Baghdad Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a military
communique as saying Iraq fighter-bombers carried out the
``accurate and effective'' shipping raid Wednesday night.
   It did not identify the vessel and there was no immediate
independent confirmation of the attack from shipping sources.
   The official radio said the attack was carried out as part of
Iraq's campaign to choke off Iran's vital oil exports on which
Tehran depends to bankroll its war effort.
   The two countries have been at war for nearly eight years.
   The Iraqis claimed to have hit another ship in the tanker
holding area near Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal June 4. But
there has been no independent confirmation of that attack either.
   The last confirmed Iraqi air strike against shipping in the gulf
was May 16 when fighter-bombers attacked the 112,445-ton Iranian
tanker Bisoton.
   The Bisoton was formerly the Norwegian-owned Mia Margrethe,
which was hit by two Iranian gunboats in the southern gulf last
June 26 and set on fire.
   About 500 merchant ships have been attacked by both sides in the
so-called ``tanker war'' that began in early 1984. More than 300
seamen have been killed.

   Chinese militiamen this month killed or wounded
12 Vietnamese soldiers who intruded into Chinese territory, the
official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   The report quoted military sources as saying militiamen killed
or wounded four Vietnamese special agents in Diaobao Village,
Yunnan province on June 4.
   Two days later four more intruders were gunned down by Chinese
soldiers who came to the aid of farmers under attack.
   Another surprise attack was put down on June 7, with four more
Vietnamese falling, the report said.
   Xinhua did not say whether there were any Chinese casualties in
the clashes.
   Chinese and Vietnamese forces have fought intermittently along
the common border since China launched a short cross-border war in
1979 to ``punish'' Vietnam for invading Cambodia.
   Reports by both sides of intrusions and battles cannot be
independently confirmed.'

<HEAD>Blacks Return to Work After Anti-Apartheid Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks returned to work and
school today after more than 2 million stayed away for three days
to protest curbs on anti-apartheid activity and legislative
proposals to limit the right to strike.
   Organizers called the nation's longest and largest general
strike a success, and the white minority government's manpower
minister said he might delay action on the proposed labor
legislation.
   Employers estimated that the strike cost the economy $250
million.
   Downtown Johannesburg, which had been relatively deserted, was
bustling again. For the first time this week, fleets of mini-bus
taxis arrived carrying workers from the huge black township of
Soweto.
   In Durban, the port city where the strike was most effective,
transport companies said ridership on commuter trains and buses
remained 20 percent below normal. Officials suggested some blacks
feared it was unsafe to return to work because commuter buses had
been stoned and firebombed during the strike.
   Police said three men were stabbed to death by other blacks
during the night at Riverview in Natal province. There was an
unconfirmed report that a fourth man was killed there today when a
mine in his possession exploded.
   Eight other killings were reported earlier this week in Natal,
where groups supporting and opposing the protest clashed. Two
people were killed in unrest elsewhere during the strike.
   Black labor federations, backed by prominent clergymen,
organized the strike to protest restrictions put on anti-apartheid
groups Feb. 24 and proposed legislation that would limit the right
of unions to strike.
   Today's editions of the financial newspaper Business Day quoted
Manpower Minister Pieter du Plessis as saying he planned to send a
formal invitation to black labor leaders to meet with him.
   Du Plessis also offered to suspend action on certain clauses of
the labor bill if the unions could convince him this was warranted,
Business Day said.
   To anti-apartheid activists, the protest was a success because
it took place without overt help from the restricted opposition
groups.
   ``The stayaway is an indication of the determination of the
people to oppose the apartheid government,'' said the Rev. Frank
Chikane, general secretary of the South African Council of
Churches. ``It means the February restrictions have not suppressed
the spirit of resistance.''
   Security forces maintained a relatively low profile during the
protest and government officials made virtually no public
statements about it, but employers threatened to reduce work forces
and move toward mechanization if political strikes continue.
   Black miners virtually ignored the strike and kept the nation's
most lucrative industry operating almost normally despite support
for the protest by the National Union of Mineworkers leadership.
   Mining produces 80 percent of South Africa's export earnings.
   Including the near-total boycott of urban black schools, the
number of participants each day appeared to have exceeded 2 million
_ the number of people who stayed home June 16, 1986 to protest the
nationwide state of emergency imposed four days earlier.
   President P.W. Botha declared the emergency to combat a black
uprising against apartheid, the racial policy that preserves power
for South Africa's 5 million whites and denies the 26 million
blacks a voice in national affairs.
   It is expected to be renewed this week for a third year. The
state of emergency gives police sweeping powers of detention
without trial, imposes press restrictions and outlaws several forms
of peaceful protest.
   Police told news media this week it was illegal under emergency
regulations to report on the extent of a general strike.
   Such reports were carried by pro-government newspapers and the
state-run broadcasting company, along with other media, but many
accounts were worded cautiously and avoided positive assessments of
the strike.

a 17-year-old Arab in a clash.
   Meanwhile, Israeli physicians accused the army of causing
paralyzing injuries by using powerful high-speed bullets to
disperse demonstrators.
   Seventeen-year-old Ahmed Hassan Hawari died after he was shot in
the head during a confrontation with troops in Sebastiya, near
Nablus in the West Bank, said officials at Ittihad hospital in
Nablus.
   An 18-year-old youth and a 12-year-old girl were shot and
wounded when soldiers fired at protesters in the West Bank town of
Tulkarem, officials at the Tulkarem and Nablus hospitals said. Both
were shot in the legs.
   Another seven Tulkarem residents were treated for cuts inflicted
by rubber bullets, the hospital official said.
   An Israeli military spokesman said the army was checking the
reports.
   Since the anti-occupation unrest began Dec. 8 in the lands
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war, 203 Palestinians and two
Israelis have been killed. More than 5,000 Arabs have been wounded
or injured and 5,000 are in jail.
   Underground leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization
ordered today's general strike. Stores were closed, workers stayed
home, public transportation was paralyzed and many children stayed
home from school.
   Men with kafiyeh headresses wrapped around their faces went into
schools in the West Bank and encouraged children to leave classes
and demonstrate, Israeli army radio said.
   An underground leaflet calling for the general strike urged
children to stay out of schools, which have opened in recent weeks
after a four-month shutdown ordered by Israeli military authorities.
   The army clamped curfews on about 110,000 Palestinians in
villages or refugee camps. They included the Jabaliya refugee camp
in Gaza, which has been under curfew for a week, and the West Bank
village of Janiya and Beit Ur Et Tahta, where attackers hurled
firebombs at two Israeli vehicles overnight.
   Two army officers suffered minor injuries when their jeep was
hit by a firebomb and set ablaze in Janiya, the army said.
   Six Israeli doctors said in a report on military action in the
Gaza Strip that the army should not disperse protesters with
high-velocity bullets of the type used in the M-16 automatic rifle.
   The report said such bullets produced 13 paraplegics and two
quadaplegics and caused 20 cases of serious internal injuries.
   It also accused the army of misusing tear gas by firing into
enclosed areas, failing to keep proper records of injuries and
failing to carry out autopsies in unexplained deaths.
   In some cases, the army transferred seriously injured people to
Israeli hospitals to interrogate them, thereby exposing them to
increased risk, the report charged.
   A military spokesman denied most of the charges in the medical
report and said the army never gives out information about the
types of ammunition it uses.
   ``Transfer to hospitals in Israel is done solely in order to
give the patient better treatment that is not available in Gaza
hospitals,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. ``It is
done for only humanitarian reasons.''
   He said the army frequently does not conduct autopsies because
Arab families oppose them and regularly take away and bury the
bodies of relatives before autopsies can be performed.
   The team of doctors, organized by left-wing Parliament member
Dedi Zucker, said it could not determine whether tear gas causes
miscarriages. Palestinian women have charged they suffered
miscarriages after being exposed to tear gas in enclosed spaces.
   The physicians did report that a 35-year-old pregnant woman's
fetus died after troops twice accidentally fired tear gas into her
home.
   Two elderly women suffered a heart attack and a paralyzing
stroke after being exposed to tear gas in a closed area, the report
said.
   ``We deny altogether that the army uses tear gas incorrectly or
that it causes miscarriage,'' said the army spokesman, who said the
tear gas was tested for side effects. But he said ``there may be
specific cases where for example tear gas penetrate a home by
accident.''
   The report, described as a preliminary study, was based on
interviews with Arab physicians and medical officers for the army's
administration in the Gaza Strip.

   The U.S. dollar rose in moderate European trading
early today. Gold bullion fell.
   The dollar benefited from statements Wednesday by central
bankers meeting in Chicago indicating support for stabilizing the
currency.
   Profit-taking put some pressure on the dollar in the first hours
of European trading today, but it was holding steady at generally
higher levels.
   Traders said they did not expect any big currency swings, given
market uncertainty over next Tuesday's report on the U.S. trade
deficit in April.
   Here are selected midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared
with late Wednesday:
   _1.7219 West German marks, up from 1.7183
   _1.4370 Swiss francs, up from 1.4350
   _5.8105 French francs, up from 5.7923
   _1.9336 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9250
   _1,279.20 Italian lire, up from 1,273.50
   _1.2225 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2220
   The dollar rose against the British pound, which slipped to
$1.8120 from Wednesday's $1.8175.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.43 Japanese yen, marginally
up from 125.32 yen on Wednesday. In London trading later today, the
dollar fetched 125.30 yen.
   London's main bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $455 a troy ounce, down from $458 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold traded at a bid of $454.90, down from $458.50.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $456.59, down
from $458.98.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $7 a troy ounce,
down from $7.15.

<HEAD>Federal Inspectors Launch Probe of O'Hare Controller Errors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three mistakes in two days by air traffic
controllers at O'Hare International Airport prompted federal safety
officials to begin an investigation of the system for directing
planes in the area, officials said.
   Officials at the National Transportation Safety Board were
alarmed because controllers made two errors Monday and one Tuesday,
raising to 20 the number of mistakes they've made at the nation's
second busiest airport this year, said Mike Benson, an agency
spokesman.
   ``The significant increase in operational errors, from 12 in all
of last year to 20 already this year, set off concern for us,''
Benson said Wednesday.
   Benson said four investigators would arrive in Chicago, possibly
today. Their investigation initially will focus on controllers in
O'Hare's radar room, where most of the mistakes have been made,
Benson said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration plans to send three safety
specialists to assist and ``allow the FAA to take immediate action
if any discrepancies are uncovered,'' FAA Administrator T. Allan
McArtor said.
   The FAA also said it has assigned eight additional air-traffic
controllers to help overworked controllers at O'Hare during the
busy summer season, The Washington Post reported today.
   Controllers in the radar room are in charge of routing air
traffic in a 30-mile radius of O'Hare, while controllers in the
tower primarily direct landings and takeoffs, Benson said.
   Last year, controllers in O'Hare's radar room made nine of the
12 operational errors, he said. This year, the radar room has been
responsible for 15 of the 20 mistakes, including the three this
week, Benson said.
   Monday's first error involved a United Airlines jetliner bound
for Ontario, Calif., and a Lear jet, Benson said.
   After take-off, radar records showed that the Boeing 727,
carrying 128 passengers, came within 1,200 feet of the other plane,
said Dan Sheehy, a United spokesman.
   Such incidents are not classified as near-collisions unless the
aircraft come within less than 500 feet of each other.
   Sheehy said the United pilot did not file a near-collision
report, but the company was investigating the incident.
   ``Our captain did not take any evasive action because there was
no reason to _ there was enough separation between the planes,''
Sheehy said.
   But the pilot of the Lear Jet filed a near-collision report,
said agency spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   Later Monday, radar room controllers were blamed for an error
involving United Flight 608, a Boeing 727 bound for Washington, and
a Cessna 172 airplane, said Sheehy and Benson.
   Tuesday's error involved an American Airlines DC-10 and a Midway
Airlines Boeing 737, Benson said. He said he could provide no other
details.
   The NTSB team will begin by investigating the three errors and
then interview the controllers involved in this year's other
mistakes, he said.
   Then they will interview a cross-section of controllers and
examine programs that influence their job performance, such as
training, quality assurance and amount of overtime worked.
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, based in
Washington, said O'Hare, like other airports nationwide, is plagued
by short staffing and overworked controllers.
   ``We would welcome any type of outside oversight right now,''
said John Thornton, the group's national coordinator. ``Around the
country we're seeing short staffs, equipment problems and sometimes
an insensitivity on the part of the FAA to resolve these problems.''
   During the past several years, the FAA's air-traffic control
operations at O'Hare have been scrutinized by the safety board and
Congess because of the airport's congested skies and a shortage of
fully trained controllers.

   Is honesty still the best policy?
Only if you talk to the right bureaucrat.
   Consider the case of Peter Elia of Mendham Township, who during
one recent morning rush found a cashier's check for $10,000 on the
floor of a commuter train station not far from this New York City
suburb.
   An amazing stroke of luck, but not for Elia, who spent the
better part of his day trying to return the check to its owner.
   Elia, 36, said he made several calls to Chemical Bank in New
York, which had issued the check, but nobody at the bank would take
responsibility for finding its owner.
   ``They switched me to about eight different branches,'' he said.
``Amazingly, one guy even told me how to cash it.''
   But Elia perservered, finally taking the check to the New York
Post, which contacted Chemical Bank officials.
   The bank issued a red-faced apology to Elia, a merchandising
manager for Kinney Shoes in Manhattan.
   ``I certainly extend our apologies to Mr. Elia,'' bank spokesman
Kenneth Herz said. ``We very much appreciate what he did.''

   A man and woman who made it through 48
states on motorcycles in less than seven days said they roared
swiftly to their goal _ until they hit the East Coast.
   ``It wasn't just one traffic jam,'' said Michael Kneebone of
Chicago. ``There was road construction, accidents, morning traffic.
... Everywhere we went up the East Coast there were massive
accidents and trouble.''
   Kneebone and Fran Crane of Santa Cruz, Calif., drove 7,700 miles
to Brattleboro from Pendleton, Ore., in six days, 13 hours, 21
minutes, hoping to land in the Guinness Book of World Records.
   If Guinness officials confirm the time, it will shave more than
four days off the unofficial world record for the feat, and even
more from the current record in the Guinness Book.
   Kneebone said the trip went very smoothly the first six days,
until they reached Baltimore.
   ``From there on in is where everything fell apart,'' he said.

   Heidi and Holly Smith didn't find a
pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, but the cousins did find a
cache of cash in the trash.
   Holly, 13, and Heidi, 10, were helping Holly's sister-in-law,
Kathy Dockweiler, at the Daylight Donuts shop Monday when they
stumbled on the cash while dumping a load of garbage.
   ``I asked Heidi if I was dreaming and she said I probably was,''
Holly said.
   The girls brought the money, wet and covered with coffee
grounds, inside and Dockweiler helped lay it out to dry.
   ``It looked like we were counterfeiting money,'' Holly said.
   There was little question about the money's owner: checks were
made out to the Daylight Donuts shop and there was a shop invoice
among the cash.
   Shop manager Klynn Knoll confirmed the trash cash belonged to
the store, but wasn't quite sure how the money _ about $380 in cash
and $120 in checks _ got into the garbage.
   ``I told them that they ought to be really proud of
themselves,'' Knoll said about the money finders. ``They were
really honest with it and returned it all.''

   Muhammad Ali says he must take medication
every three hours to relieve some of the symptoms of Parkinson's
syndrome, but he insists he is not brain-damaged and his slurred
speech comes from fear of crowds.
   ``It's unfortunate that people have an image of me as a
legendary figure ... and if they see me as anything less than
Superman, they can't accept it,'' he said in an interview published
today in The Washington Post.
   The former three-time heavyweight champion said he is frustrated
that he can't demonstrate to people that he is not brain-damaged
and that he is hurt when people talk about him in his presence as
if he doesn't understand them.
   ``I bet you're surprised I'm talking this good,'' Ali said to a
Post reporter during the telephone interview. ``See, I'm not
stupid. I'm not brain-damaged. The mind is good. ... The difference
now is that I don't feel so crowded.''
   ``When it's crowded, I feel pressure and I just can't project,''
he said.
   Ali was in Washington to attend a Capitol Hill news conference
Tuesday to announce the appointment of a friend, Stephen Saltzburg,
to a Justice Department post.
   Doctors have said Ali's illness is a progressive neurological
degeneration related to Parkinson's disease that was caused by
blows he suffered during his boxing career. Parkinson's disease is
a potentially fatal condition that causes gradual loss of muscle
control, sometimes leading to the slurred speech that has been the
source of rumors about Ali being brain-damaged.
   Ali said the medication he takes every three hours ``makes a
real difference'' in how he feels. He wouldn't discuss the
treatment in detail, but said his speech shows it if he deviates
from the regimen.
   ``God gave me this physical impairment to remind me that I am
not the greatest. He is,'' he said.
   During the wide-ranging interview, Ali also spoke of Jesse
Jackson's presidential campaign and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``I like Jesse, but I think his timing's off,'' he said.
   ``He needs to prove that he is not just a cheerleader. He should
run for office and get himself elected governor or senator. I think
it's too big a responsibility for him to be the leader of the free
world right out of the starting gate.''
   About Gorbachev, Ali said: ``If it's all a show, he's a better
actor than Ronald Reagan.''

   A Navy investigator has begun
deliberating on whether five swimming instructors and a commanding
officer should be court-martialed for a recruit's death during a
training program.
   A Navy prosecutor contended Wednesday in his closing arguments
that the use of force to stop Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki from
quitting the elite rescue swimmer training program was a crime.
   ``These men were not malicious, they were hardened,'' said Lt.
Cmdr Larry D. Wynne in his closing arguments. ``They were not
vicious; they were indifferent. They saw, saw but did not
perceive.''
   Five of Mirecki's instructors at the Pensacola Naval Air Station
rescue swimmer school and its commanding officer should be
court-martialed, Wynne contended as attorneys concluded their cases
in the four-day investigative hearing.
   Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio Jr., the investigator, will make a
recommendation on the court-martial charges to Rear Adm. David
Morris, chief of naval air training, at a later date.
   Morris, based in Corpus Christi, Texas, has 120 days after the
May 10 filing of the charges to begin court-martial proceedings, if
that is his choice. Other options are non-judicial punishment or
dismissal of the charges.
   The 19-year-old recruit from Appleton, Wis., died March 2 after
allegedly being forced back into a pool when he tried to quit
during a drill.
   A pathologist testified that Mirecki, who suffered heart failure
before he drowned, had a phobia about being pulled under water and
literally was scared to death. Classmates were ordered to turn
their backs on the pool and sing the national anthem before Mirecki
collapsed, witnesses said.
   The instructors charged with involuntary manslaughter are Petty
Officers 1st Class Richard E. Blevins and David J. Smith and Petty
Officers 2nd Class Frankie D. Deaton, John W. Zelenock and Michael
W. Combe.
   Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, the officer in charge of the school, is
accused of dereliction of duty.
   Mirecki had a right to quit, and the Uniform Code of Military
Justice prohibited the use of force against him, Wynne said.
   Defense lawyers argued that pushing scared, exhausted or
malingering trainees into the pool or pulling them off its walls
was an accepted practice. ``This is the Navy,'' said Lt. Julie L.
Hoving, Deaton's lawyer. ``The students must be forced to their
limits.''
   She and other defense counsel contended that failure to use
force to simulate the stress of an actual rescue in bad weather or
combat situation would not adequately prepare students and could
endanger them and those they are trying to save.
   Wynne said Torchia was in his office overlooking the pool 100
feet away when Mirecki was being pushed in. He contended the
officer could see and hear what was happening but did nothing.
   Torchia's lawyers introduced a report on a lie detector test
indicating he was telling the truth when he said he was taking a
telephone call from headquarters in Washington, and neither saw nor
heard what was going on.
   Witnesses testified Mirecki had tried to quit training a month
before he died and subsequently was classified by a flight surgeon
as unfit to continue because he had a phobia about being dragged
under water.
   A clinical psychologist disagreed with the finding, and Mirecki
was returned to training through a series of errors without
obtaining a required physical examination and a flight surgeon's
approval, witnesses said.

<TEXT>
   Motown Records, which exploded onto the music
scene 20 years ago with a string of hits by Smokey Robinson, the
Supremes and others, is about to be sold for $61 million, a
newspaper reported today.
   A tentative agreement calls for MCA to pay 20 percent of the
purchase price, with the investment group Boston Ventures Limited
Partnership putting up the balance, according to the Los Angeles
Times.
   MCA would retain distribution rights to Motown's recordings for
10 years, the newspaper said.
   Motown, founded by auto worker-turned-songwriter Berry Gordy Jr.
in Detroit, is of the most prestigious record labels in the music
industry but has had less success in recent years.
   Motown introduced such black artists to the music world as
Robinson, the Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the
Temptations, Gladys Knight and the Pips and the Jackson 5, which
featured Michael Jackson.
   In 1966, Motown had 22 Top-20 hits, but stars like Jackson and
Diana Ross, originally with the Supremes, have since moved on.
   The company, which moved to Los Angeles in 1971, had only two
gold albums _ at least 500,000 copies sold _ in 1987. In the latest
Billboard magazine, only one Motown album is ranked in the Top 200,
Wonder's ``Characters, in 125th place.
   Not included in the proposed sale are Motown's music publisher,
Jobete Music, which owns the rights to nearly all of the company's
hit records, and Motown Productions, a TV and film production unit.
   MCA nearly bought Motown early in 1987, but the deal fell
through. Gordy reportedly changed his mind.

   Kidnappers freed a 30-year-old
building contractor they had held for six months after his family
paid a ransom of $2.4 million, Italian news agencies reported today.
   Oreste Villa was released late Wednesday, police said. He had
been held in tiny tents and cabins in the Aspromonte mountains of
southern Italy.
   Villa was kidnapped Nov. 24 while driving to his home near Como
in northern Italy's Lombardy region. Police said he was taken by
truck to the Calabria peninsula, at the toe of the Italian boot.
   Villa's father, Arialdo Villa, was quoted by the ANSA news
agency as saying that his son was held in six or seven different
hideouts, always small huts or tents. ANSA said Villa told police
that he had one foot chained to a post at all times.
   Villa was reported exhausted but in fair condition. He was
staying at a hotel with his father before returning to Como.
   ``The only problem is that his legs hurt from the cold of the
long months and long walks in the snow,'' his father was quoted as
saying.
   Police said Villa was released near Santa Cristina d'Aspromonte,
a small mountain town about 50 miles outside the provincial capital
Reggio di Calabria. He walked for several hours before coming upon
a police patrol.
   Police began a massive search for the captors, whose identities
and exact number were not immediately known.

   Three fifth-graders accused of raping
other boys in the school bathroom told police they were mimicking
things they had seen on cable television, authorities said.
   The three boys, ages 10, 11 and 12, were arrested Wednesday on
one count of each of sexual battery.
   ``They indicated they saw risque movies late at night on
cable,'' said police Sgt. James Mazer.
   The boys and the alleged victims are in the same class at Ida M.
Fisher Elementary School. Principal Paulette Martin alerted police
about the alleged attacks, which occurred during school hours
between January and April, Mazer said.
   ``We're talking perhaps six to nine victims, but we're really
not sure yet,'' said police spokesman Tom Hoolahan. ``We do know
that the victims are isolated within one group within the school.''
   The three alleged offenders were ``older looking and stronger''
and apparently coerced their victims, Mazer said. The three acted
as a group and also individually, he said.
   ``We get victims as young as three months, but I don't remember
ever hearing of such young offenders,'' said Mazer.
   The two older boys have been placed in state custody, although
the 11-year-old already was under state custody for unrelated
battery charges, Mazer said. The youngest of the accused was
released to his parents' custody.
   ``I'm shocked because my son goes to that school,'' Victoria
Hernandez said. ``My son is only 8 years old and I'm afraid now for
him and for all the children there in the school. It's terrible.''
   ``They're not doing their job,'' said another parent, Victoria
Gomez. ``They're not watching the children the way they should be
watched.''
   James Fleming, assistant superintendent of Dade County schools,
said the school had the same security other public schools have.

   The Bavarian capital of Munich has
set up a ``Kiss and Ride'' zone near a busy subway station to
prevent parting couples from causing traffic jams, a city offical
said today.
   The head of Munich's public transport system, Dieter Lippert,
said a ``test Kiss and Ride area'' has been set up near the Olympic
Stadium Center subway station, where men and women often drop off
their partners to catch the subway to work.
   ``The kissing especially held up rush-hour traffic ... and cars
often barely avoided accidents because of it,'' Lippert told The

   Lippert, who heads the city's subway, bus and streetcar system,
said that a side strip of road near the station is being clearly
marked with signs for ``Kiss and Ride'' passengers.
   If the test proves successful, more such zones may be set up
along busy Munich streets where couples drop off their partners, he
said.
   ``I don't think they'll turn into necking zones,'' Lippert said.
``The drivers usually don't get that carried away.''

<TEXT>
   An Amish convict must submit to an ID
photograph despite objections on religious grounds, a federal
appeals court has ruled.
   The 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld a
lower court ruling in the case of Andy Slabaugh of Canton, Minn.,
who was charged in 1986 with offering an IRS agent a $500 bribe.
   Federal marshals were required to photograph him at the time of
prisoner processing.
   Slabaugh, however, cited the biblical commandment against the
making of graven images and argued that his appearance was
distinctive enough to make a photo unnecessary _ he has one arm and
wears a long beard and plain Amish dress.
   The picture-taking was delayed until the court could hold a
hearing. Before the hearing could be held, he pleaded guilty and
was placed on three years' probation.
   A U.S. District Court later ruled that the government had a
compelling public-safety interest that overrode Slabaugh's right to
free exercise of religion.
   The appeals court affirmed the ruling but said that because
Slabaugh had pleaded guilty, the lower court needed only to find
that the photograph had a ``reasonable relationship'' to the
purposes of the probation law.
   Scott Tilsen, a public defender who represented Slabaugh, said
he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<NOTE>Eds: TOPS with 9 grafs on AIDS hotline calls; picks up 3rd graf,
Regrettably, perhaps.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A federal health official said today that
national distribution of a pamphlet on AIDS has dramatically
increased calls to AIDS hotlines, but he acknowledged that not all
of them are giving callers the same answers.
   Dr. James Mason, director of the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, said calls on the centers' Spanish-language hotline have
risen from about 20 a day before May 26, when the mass mailing
began, to almost 6,000 a day now.
   One day last week, there were 17,000 calls on all the centers'
hotlines, compared to about 6,000 a day before the mailing to 107
million U.S. households, he said.
   Meanwhile, a congressional report released Wednesday said
``substantial misconceptions'' remain about AIDS, and witnesses
told a panel that efforts to educate the public are often bogged
down in red tape.
   Mason, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said it is
understandable that callers to the ``literally hundreds'' of
hotlines around the country are getting different answers on some
aspects of the disease.
   ``We need to do everything we can to standardize those answers,
and we're doing that, but that you're getting a few different
answers is not really surprising,'' Mason said.
   He said the CDC has put out a list of 30 standard questions and
answers about the disease, but it does not cover every conceivable
situation that callers might raise.
   Mason said hotlines run by state health agencies and most
community hotlines are reliable. But if callers ``want to be
sure,'' he said, they should call federal or state government
hotlines.
   A Philadelphia city official, testifying before Congress, said
bureaucracy has become ``a major enemy'' of cities trying to fight
the AIDS epidemic, and singer Dionne Warwick said the AIDS
information pamphlet distributed by the federal government to every
household is no panacea.
   ``Regrettably, perhaps the most important people that we need to
reach to stem the spread did not receive these brochures, or if
they did, simply ignored them and never read them,'' Miss Warwick
told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at a hearing
Wednesday.
   Miss Warwick has begun a foundation to award grants to community
groups for AIDS education programs, especially those targeted at
minorities that are disproportionately affected by the disease.
   A study released at the hearing by the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment found that ``the general population continues
to hold substantial misconceptions'' about how the AIDS virus is
transmitted.
   These include believing one can become infected by donating
blood or by working near someone with the virus, the study said.
   Still, OTA said education through the mass media can change
behavior, as shown in campaigns to stop people from smoking. The
agency also noted that ``dramatic behavioral change has occurred
among homosexual males in response to the AIDS epidemic.''
   David Fair, executive assistant to the health commissioner for
AIDS programs in Philadelphia, told the panel that three AIDS
testing and counseling centers have not yet opened because $800,000
in federal money the city expected to receive last September has
become entangled in bureaucracy.
   The problem, he said, lies in Philadelphia's reliance on the
state government, which distributes the federal money to cities.
   ``They hold up, they play that kind of politics even though it's
an AIDS situation?'' committee chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio, asked.
   ``Absolutely,'' Fair replied. ``The reference that I use when
talking to state legislators is that AIDS is not a weatherization
project. They need to treat it a little bit differently.''
   Asked by Glenn whether the Pennsylvania case was common, Alan
Hinman of the federal Center for Prevention Services, said, ``Not
every state has problems getting funds out, but there are problems,
yes.''
   Gary Noble, deputy director for AIDS at the federal Centers for
Disease Control, said the agency is re-examining the criteria for
distributing money to large cities, where acquired immune
deficiency syndrome is most prevalent.
   CDC staff levels present another problem, Michael Zimmerman of
the General Accounting Office said.
   The staff assigned by CDC to manage its AIDS education efforts
``appears to be insufficient to monitor state and local health
departments and advise them on how to develop and operate effective
AIDS education programs,'' he said.
   AIDS, a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, is spread most often through sexual contact, needles shared
by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
infected pregnant women to their offspring.

<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A Valparaiso University fraternity has
been suspended for at least three years for a ritual May 16 in
which a senior was burned in a hot mixture of peanut butter and
excrement.
   University President Robert V. Schnabel, in a statement
Wednesday withdrawing campus recognition from Sigma Phi Epsilon,
called the matter a ``deplorable and unfortunate incident.''
   Steven R. Jenny, 23, was stripped of his clothes and four
gallons of peanut butter, urine and feces were poured on him in a
fraternity ritual known as lavaliering.
   The senior suffered burns on his back, buttocks, abdomen and
groin. He was hospitalized for two days but refused to press
charges against the 30 or so people involved in the incident in the
fraternity house parking lot.
   The ritual is performed when a fraternity member gives a
lavalier, or necklace, to a woman.
   During the suspension, the fraternity house may be kept open for
seniors, but they cannot hold fraternity activities and the group's
sign will be removed from the house, said Daryll Hersemann, vice
president of student affairs.
   ``The university has determined that its regulations have been
broken and that the moral and ethical standards and agreements
which it expects all members of its community to adhere to have
been seriously violated,'' Schnabel said.
   Students at the university have gone home for the summer.
Fraternity president Glen Mutscher could not be reached for comment
about the suspension.
   David Gring, whose term as chapter president ended in December,
said he was left ``speechless'' by the penalty. ``I didn't think it
would be three years. I don't know how the rest of the alumni will
react,'' he said.

<HEAD>Group Will Consider Proposal for National Health Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Society and individuals alike have a moral
obligation to promote good health, and the government should
establish a ``national health standard,'' says a proposed policy
before the nation's largest Presbyterian group.
   The report on health costs and policies was one of a number of
papers on the agenda today as 630 delegates to the annual meeting
of the 3-million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) began two days
of committee meetings.
   Central America, denominational finances, pornography and
political and social involvement also will be discussed in meetings
through Saturday, when the delegates, or commissioners, assemble to
act on committee recommendations.
   On Wednesday, the first full day of the 200th General Assembly,
the Rev. C. Kenneth Hall, 63, was elected moderator, or chief
spokesman, of the denomination. Hall, pastor of the 640-member Hill
United Presbyterian Church in Butler, Pa., defeated four other
candidates on the first ballot.
   Health care is a ``crisis of economics with serious moral
import,'' according to the paper prepared by the church's Advisory
Council on Church and Society.
   ``We are killing ourselves needlessly with substance abuse,
highway accidents, violence and suicide,'' the paper says, ``and
our health is undermined and continually threatened by pollution of
our environment by chemical toxins, nuclear and industrial waste,
and ocean dumping of garbage.''
   The paper calls on Congress to define by 1990 a National Health
Standard of ``adequate, quality health care, including prevention
and health promotion; acute care; chronic care; long-term
institutional care; rehabilitive care, and care for catastrophic
illness.''
   Congress should then require all employers, public and private,
to provide their employees and their dependents with insurance that
meets the standard, the paper says.
   The paper says individuals have ``a public and private duty to
value and care for his or her own health and the health of the
community.''
   Hall said his unusual first-ballot win reflected delegates'
concern over the loss of 300,000 members since 1983, when the
denomination was formed by merging the United Presbyterian Church
in the United States of America and the Presbyterian Church in the
United States, the Southern stream.
   He said his victory gave him a mandate to concentrate on
evangelism and healing. Hall selected 50-year-old Ruth Montoya of
Arvada, Colo., as vice moderator.

   The owners of a restaurant are having
a food fight with the Health Department over when, exactly,
leftovers become leftovers.
   Saginaw County health officials have ordered the Bavarian Inn to
stop serving food left on its platters to employees.
   ``As of (Tuesday), everything is going down the drain like they
say it has to,'' said Don Keller, the restaurant's marketing and
sales director. The restaurant faced revocation of its license if
it didn't comply.
   The owners admitted to health inspectors during an inspection in
April that they re-served food to employees, a violation of state
law, officials said.
   Keller said the law is not properly written for family-style
restaurants such as the Bavarian Inn where food is served on
platters that diners pass around the table.
   ``We agree it would be revolting to take food off someone else's
plate,'' Keller said. ``But we are saying it isn't served until it
goes on the customer's plate. The health department is saying, once
it leaves the kitchen, it is served.''
   ``We are quietly trying to figure out some way this good food
can be used again,'' Keller said.

<HEAD>Fallen Gorbachev Protege Elected as Party Conference Delegate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, a fallen protege of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has been elected a delegate to a
Communist Party conference that will review reforms in the Soviet
Union, a government official said today.
   Yeltsin will represent the party organization of Karelia, an
autonomous Soviet republic northeast of Leningrad, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters at a news briefing.
   The selection of Yeltsin could make for lively debate if he
speaks at the conference, which runs from June 28 to July 1.
   Yeltsin, 57, was fired as Moscow party boss and stripped of his
post as a non-voting member of the country's ruling Politburo
because of an angry speech he gave last October.
   In the speech to the party's policy-making Central Committee,
Yeltsin criticized the No. 2 man in the Soviet leadership, Yegor K.
Ligachev, and complained that reforms were moving too slowly.
   He gave several interviews to Western television networks last
week, solidifying his reputation for speaking his mind freely about
controversial matters. In one interview, he called for Ligachev to
resign because he said Ligachev was blocking reforms.
   Gerasimov said there was no requirement in party rules that a
conference delegate live or work in the area he is chosen to
represent. Yeltsin lives in Moscow, where his current job is first
deputy chairman of the State Building Committee.
   The Karelian Autonomous Republic borders Finland and has a
population of 746,000. It has played an important role in the
careers of other party officials. The chief of the area's Komsomol,
the party youth organization, from 1940-1944 was Yuri V. Andropov,
who went on to succeed Leonid I. Brezhnev in November 1982 as
general secretary of the national party. Andropov died in 1984.
   The party conference is shaping up to be a battleground for
supporters of Gorbachev's social and economic reforms known as
perestroika and the mid-level managers who resist him.
   Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a prominent Soviet sociologist, has said
``the most pronounced advocates of perestroika were not selected''
as conference delegates.
   The newspaper of the Moscow city party, Moskovskaya Pravda,
complained today that ``election of the candidates not everywhere
has been conducted in the atmosphere of wide glasnost,''
Gorbachev's policy of openness on selected issues.
   The newspaper said the nominating procedure should be changed
because some party and non-party members ``could not speak out
their opinions.''
   The conference, the first of its kind in 47 years, will review
proposals to consolidate political changes favored by Gorbachev,
including limits on terms for party officials.
   According to party sources, there will be about one delegate for
every 3,800 party members at the conference.

   China told the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that
terrorists from another country may be planning attacks on
Americans in the Chinese capital, the U.S. Embassy said today.
   The embassy sent out an ``urgent notice to American citizens''
warning them of the security threat and telling them be cautious.
   Embassy officials circulated among staff members and American
businessmen a 15-point list of ``personal security tips'' giving
such advice as ``Don't daydream while traveling to and from work''
and ``Vary your activities, times, and transport routes.''
   The notice said there was no specific information on the time or
place of such an attack. ``But the embassy believes that this
warning reflects a genuine threat and that American citizens in the
Beijing area should take appropriate steps to protect themselves,''
it said.
   Consular Office Second Secretary Dewey Pendergrass said the
embassy had been informed of the threat Wednesday from high-level
public security officials.
   ``We're taking it seriously,'' he said.
   Pendergrass said an emergency meeting of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Beijing was called today to discuss the reported threat.
   It said Americans should not be lured into conversations with
strangers and should not stop where crowds have gathered as a
result of a traffic accident or supposed misunderstanding.
   The notice recommended that American citizens avoid gathering
points for Americans or foreigners, such as certain restaurants,
markets or nightclubs.
   It went out to all registered American residents in Beijing and
the port city of Tianjin 60 miles to the southeast.
   About 1,100 Americans living in the Chinese capital have
registered at the embassy. It is believed there are another 400 to
500 Americans, mainly students, who have not notified the embassy
of their presence in Beijing.
   So far there have been no reported incidents in communist China
of terrorists attacking Chinese or foreign citizens.
   Embassy spokeswoman Sylvia B. Rifkin said the embassy previously
has sent out warnings to Americans based on worldwide alerts
against terrorists, but this was the first time the warning
specifically concerned China.
   Asked to speculate on who might pose a threat to Americans, she
said, ``Your guess is as good as mine.''

<TEXT>
   The Bishop of Shanghai met Taiwan's archbishop
in Hong Kong today in the highest-level public encounter between
religious leaders from Communist China and Nationalist Taiwan.
   Bishop Jin Luxian of Shanghai called for early negotiations
between China and the Vatican to improve their relationship. The
Chinese Catholic church broke ties with the Roman Catholic Church
in 1957.
   During a recess in an international conference on Confucianism
and Christianity, Jin invited Roman Catholic Archbishop Lo Kuang to
visit China, which the Taiwan prelate left 58 years ago.
   Lo told reporters his health would not permit him to visit the
mainland. The Nationalist Chinese fled to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to the Communists.
   Jin said he conferred for an hour with Lo after arriving here
from China on Wednesday. He said they talked about the Catholic
church on the mainland and in Taiwan.
   Jin said he first met Lo in 1948 when he was studying in Rome
and Lo was the Chinese Nationalist Party's representative at the
Vatican.
   China's breakaway Catholic Church claims 3 million members. An
unknown number of other Catholics remain secretly loyal to the
Pope, and several are imprisoned for their religious beliefs.
   Jin said the last two imprisoned priests, Zhu Weifang from
Zhejiang province and Chen Tianxiang from Jiangxi province, will be
released soon. He gave no other details.
   Referring to ties between Beijing and the Vatican, Jin said
nothing can be solved without negotiations.
   The Shanghai Bishop said he had also invited the newly-elevated
Cardinal of Hong Kong, John Baptist Wu, to China.
   Wu was named cardinal on May 29 by the pope. Vatican officials
described the appointment as especially significant because Hong
Kong will revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
   More than 70 scholars and religious leaders from North American,
Europe and Asia are attending the week-long conference in Hong Kong.

   A former E.F. Hutton broker has pleaded
guilty to taking part in a money-laundering scheme at the firm's
local branch.
   Brain J. Lareau, 46, of Jamestown pleaded guilty Wednesday to
violating the Social Security Act and money-laundering. Lareau, who
worked at the branch from 1980 to 1985, admitted laundering
$183,950 from August 1982 to October 1984.
   Lareau, and another former broker, Stephen S. Fusco, who has
since died, helped clients hide about $1.5 million in cash from the
Internal Revenue Service and Securities Exchange Commission,
according to authorities.
   According to court documents, Lareau created a fictitious
account with a fake Social Security number and used it to conceal a
customer's money. Fusco was accused of helping organized crime
figures launder illegal profits.
   Lareau could receive up to six years in prison and $6,000 in
fines at sentencing July 22. Under a plea bargain, prosecutors will
recommend no more than six months in prison.
   E.F. Hutton & Co. Inc. pleaded guilty May 16 to money-laundering
and conspiracy and was fined $1.01 million, the largest fine ever
imposed in a money-laundering case.
   Hutton was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
The company now is known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

   Gary Stollman, 34, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of

thousands of viewers.
   ``I didn't think it would benefit anyone to put Gary in the
general prison population,'' Horowitz said of the sentence. ``I'm
satisfied that Gary will get the treatment he needs.''
   ``The positive side of te Gary Stollman case is that for three
years I was standing on a soap box screaming about lookalike toy
guns,'' Horowitz said. ``What Gary Stollman did was focus attention
on an issue that would have gotten no attention if this hadn't
happened.''
   Since the episode, he noted, several cities and states,
including California, have moved to ban toy guns
   Stollman's father, Max Stollman, is a former reporter for KNBC.

   House Speaker Jim Wright said today he is
``supremely confident'' allegations against him will be put to rest
once the House ethics committee hears his answer to charges he
violated conflict-of-interest rules through a book contract and
lobbying for oil companies.
   Wright, D-Texas, said he was filing a brief with the committee
today and was preparing a narrative to release to the public, but
he had not yet been asked to appear before the panel.
   ``I am supremely confident, when all of it is seen out on the
table in the sunlight it will be abolutely clear to everyone'' that
no rules were violated, Wright told reporters.
   The committee today holds its second meeting to review the case
against Wright and set the scope of its inquiry. Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed the complaint against Wright, has also
asked the panel to hire an independent counsel for the probe.
   Gingrich, a political foe of the speaker, charged that Wright
had a financial stake when he lobbied U.S. and foreign officials on
behalf of oil companies, and when he accepted an unusually
lucrative royalty contract from a friend and campaign contractor
who published his last book.
   Common Cause, a non-profit group which pushes for tighter
government ethics standards, also has called for an ethics
investigation.
   ``I believe I can put all the allegations to rest,'' said
Wright. ``If the committee will give priority into looking at each
and every (charge) .... it will discover I have violated no rule
and certainly violated no commonly accepted ethical standard.''
   ``I would like for it to be done at the earliest possible
time,'' he said. However, the ethics committee had not yet asked
him to appear, he said.
   Wright, chairman of next month's Democratic National Convention,
was asked if the party was concerned that his troubles might hurt
chances of regaining the White House in the fall.
   ``I haven't heard that concern expressed,'' he said, adding that
anyone who was so concerned should come and see him. The speaker
and other Democratic leaders have said Wright is a victim of a GOP
effort to distract attention from ethical lapses in the Reagan
administration.
   Privately, Wright's aides said they were frustrated with the
slow pace of the ethics committee probe.
   The committee held its first meeting on the case a week ago.
   Since that meeting, it has been reported that Wright's book, a
collection of his stories and sayings, was completed with the help
of one of his Capitol Hill staff, who took a taxpayer-financed trip
to Texas to do some of the work.
   Gingrich subsequently conceded that one of his aides helped him
with a book.
   Wright is working on another book with help from one of his
assistants, but the aide says this work is being done in his spare
time.
   The ethics committee, officially called the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct, is the only House panel with equal
representation of the two parties, with six Democrats and six
Republicans.

<HEAD>Costa Rican President Cautions Against Military Move To Oust
Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias said today that
Central American leaders oppose the use of military force to oust
Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``My conviction is that only through persuasion'' can Noreiga be
removed, Arias said at the Statehouse after a meeting with Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.
   Noriega, under indictment in the United States on drug charges,
has held on to power in the Panama despite U.S. sanctions and
protests at home.
   ``I don't think any Latin American country would be in favor of
a military solution, of military pressure, of economic sanctions,''
said Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring
peace to Central America.
   ``They hurt the Panamanian people, not necessarily the
government. ... We must reach a diplomatic solution and we would
never be in favor of military pressure.''
   Arias met with Dukakis before attending the Harvard University
commencement, at which he was to deliver a speech and receive an
honorary degree.
   ``Twenty-nine years ago I tried to get into Harvard and I wasn't
accepted. Now they are giving me an honorary degree,'' Arias joked.

   A U.S. Army helicopter on a
routine training mission struck a power line today and crashed in a
field along a busy highway, killing all three Americans on board,
Bavarian police said.
   Sgt. 1st Class John D'Amato of the 56th Field Artillery Brigade
in Schwaebish Gmuend confirmed the three crew members aboard _ all
American servicemen _ were killed.
   D'Amato said the crash occurred near the village of Hittistetten
in the district of Krumbach, about 50 miles west of Munich.
   The model UH1H helicopter was on a routine training mission and
was returing to its home base at Goettingen, nine miles west of
Schwaebisch Gmuend, when it crashed, said D'Amato. Schwaebisch
Gmuend is about 25 miles east of Stuttgart.
   ``Names of the dead are being withheld until next of kin are
notified,'' he added.
   The aircraft belonged to the 193rd Aviation Company, a support
unit of the 56th Field Artillery Brigade. A team of investigators
was on its way to the site to determine the cause of the accident,
the spokesman said.
   After crashing in the field, one of the poles supporting the
power line crashed onto the busy A7 autobahn.
   It was not immediately known if anyone on the ground was
injured. Police said a stretch of the highway temporarily was
closed after the accident.

   Thousands of radical students armed
with clubs, rocks and firebombs and screaming ``Yankee go home''
stormed into the streets today and battled riot police, who blasted
them with tear gas.
   The vicious street fighting occurred around Yonsei University,
where roughly 20,000 students had gathered for a march Friday to
Communist North Korea to press for unification of the divided
peninsula.
   Korea was split into the communist north and pro-Western south
in 1945.
   Students clashed with riot police in at least eight provincial
cities when authorities tried to block marches in support of
Friday's march or tried to stop radicals going to Seoul.
   Riot troopers guarded government buildings and diplomatic posts
in Seoul to prevent student attacks. Hundreds of police ringed the
U.S. Embassy.
   In Seoul, police armored vans fired hundreds of tear gas bombs
into the charging students as special martial arts squads tried to
hold the protesters off. At least a dozen riot policemen were
engulfed in orange flames after being hit by firebombs.
   Scores of police and protesters were injured in the fighting.
   The students had surged out the school's main gates to attack
police after they heard the sound of fighting in nearby streets,
where cordons of riot police were trying to turn away students
attempting to reach the campus.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``March to North
Korea!'' students yelled as they pelted the lines of riot police
with rocks and bricks.
   Police, trying to fend off the attacks with shields, hurled
rocks and bricks as well as tear gas grenades at the charging
protesters.
   Masked students repeatedly ran right up to the police lines to
hurl firebombs at close range. Officers with fire extinguishers
doused the blazing clothes of comrades set on fire.
   Students from dozens of colleges had gathered at Yonsei for an
overnight vigil before trying to march Friday to the North Korean
border in efforts to force unification of the divided peninsula.
   North Korea's official news agency, monitored in Tokyo, said a
North Korean student delegation already had left the capital of
Pyongyang for the border to meet the South Korean students and seek
a breakthrough for peaceful unification.
   Earlier, police had arrested scores of students who were trying
to reach the Yonsei University campus and used tear gas to disperse
groups of students in nearby side streets.
   National Police officials in Seoul reported that about 25,000
students took part in rallies at 78 colleges nationwide, but the
figure appeared low.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 1,000 students hurling
firebombs and rocks attacked riot police when authorities tried to
stop them leaving for Seoul. Police arrested about 200 students.
   Students also fought police in Suwon, Taejon, Taeju, Mockpo,
Chung, Iri and Kyongju.
   The government deployed more than 60,000 riot police and put all
security forces on maximum alert to stop Friday's planned march to
the border truce site of Panmunjom, 30 miles north of Seoul.
   Government leaders said the march was a threat to national
security and students were playing into the hands of the communist
North. Opposition politicians urged the students to cancel the
march.
   In Taejon, about 5,000 people held an anti-communist rally today
in front of the railway station to urge the students to abandon the
march.
   Radical groups claim the United States enforces partition of the
peninsula and rules the south as a colony. Their protests have been
violently anti-American, calling for withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops in the south.
   The students, a small but powerful minority, claim they are not
communist but insist Korea must be reunited and ideological
differences are secondary.
   President Roh Tae-woo insists all contacts with the north be
handled by the government. He has said he would seek meetings
between north and south students under proper supervision.
   There are no inter-government unification talks now. The last
contacts between the two sides were in 1985. North Korea rejected
talks in 1986 because of U.S.-South Korean military exercises it
said was preparation for war.
   Both sides have proposals on new talks that the other rejects.
   North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War
and repeatedly has staged terrorist attacks over the years.

   President Reagan will deliver a speech and
probably hold a news conference in Toronto on June 21 following the
close of the annual, seven-nation economic summit, it was announced
today.
   Reagan will fly to Toronto on June 19 for three days of talks
with the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy
and Japan.
   At the close of the meetings on June 21, the president probably
will hold a news conference, as he has in the past, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   In addition, Reagan will address a joint dinner of the Empire
Club and the Canadian Club, which Fitzwater described as being
dedicated to the free flow of ideas between the United States and
Canada. Fitzwater said Reagan will return to Washington late in the
evening.
   To set the stage for the summit, Reagan will deliver a speech on
Monday at the State Department before an audience of the Atlantic
Council.

<HEAD>Rocket-Fuel Plant To Resume Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only remaining U.S. plant
manufacturing a critical fuel component used in military rockets
and the space shuttle has announced it will resume production next
week.
   Kerr-McGee Corp. said Wednesday it will resume manufacture of
ammonium perchlorate Monday at its Henderson plant, which shut down
under public pressure May 12 after an explosion destroyed a
competitor's plant nearby.
   The announcement came after Rep. Robert Rowe, D-N.J., told a
hearing in Washington that the May 4 blast at the Pacific
Engineering & Production Co. plant and the shutdown at Kerr-McGee
put the nation ``on the brink of a national emergency.''
   The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology was told
that demand for ammonium perchlorate, a fuel oxidizer, would rise
from 37.8 million pounds this year to more than 60 million pounds
in 1989. The bulk of the fuel would be used by NASA, the Army, Navy
and Air Force and the rest for commercial, export and other uses.
   Anita Bridges, a Kerr-McGee spokeswoman, said company officials
have resolved their differences with the Clark County Fire
Department and state officials over the plant's safety and are
ready to resume production.
   Ms. Bridges declined to reveal the details of an agreement
reached with the department, which had threatened to block
reopening of the plant because of fears of another explosion.
   ``We've addressed all of the concerns that they raised in their
letter of May 27,'' she said.
   Fire department officials did not immediately return telephone
calls for comment.
   Ms. Bridges said the company hired a team of independent safety
experts to inspect the plant and has ``done everything humanly
possible to try to alleviate the fears and concerns of our
operation.''
   The explosion at Pacific Engineering killed two people and
caused an estimated $73 million damage.
   The Kerr-McGee plant has the capacity to manufacture 36 million
pounds a year of ammonium perchlorate. The Pacific Engineering
plant had a capacity of 20 million pounds per year.
   Ammonium perchlorate is used in such rockets as the MX and
Minuteman missiles and in the space shuttle.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said Wednesday that the agency had eight booster rockets on hand,
enough for four flights.
   Richard Truly, chief of NASA's space flight program, said the
agency's schedule of nine missions next year might have to be
adjusted, depending on how long the shortage lasts.

<TEXT>
   Opposition groups announced an
eight-hour nationwide strike for Sunday to a law making Islam the
state religion of Bangladesh.
   In separate announcements late Wednesday, the three major
political opposition alliances and the fundamentalist
Jamaat-e-Islami called for the general strike to protest the
measure, which opponents fear will lead to imposition of harsh
Islamic law.
   The eight-party alliance led by Sheik Hasina also said it would
hold a rally against the law Saturday in Dhaka, and the seven-party
coalition headed by Khaleda Zia is conducting a weeklong protest
against the measure.
   Parliament passed the bill Tuesday by a 254-0 vote after 15
opposition lawmakers walked out in protest. President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad's Jatiya Party holds 252 seats in the 300-member
assembly and was joined by two independents.
   Within minutes of the passage, thousands of people took to the
streets of the capital to protest the bill.
   Since then, at least 30 people have been injured in clashes with
police and 25 people arrested. Demonstrators also have damaged
about 35 vehicles, most of them state-owned.
   The bill amends the constitution by inserting the sentence:
``The religion of the republic is Islam, but other religions may be
practiced in peace and harmony.''
   A senior member of the Jatiya Party said today that Ershad
probably would sign the bill Saturday.
   Bangladesh is 87 percent Moslem, but opponents include women,
opposition politicians, students, labor groups and members of the
minority Christian, Hindu and Buddhist religions.
   The government denies the measure will lead to Islamic law,
saying it has no plans to change the Anglo-Saxon based civil law in
Bangladesh.
   Ershad also defended the law Wednesday in a speech near
Faridpur, 60 miles southwest of Dhaka.
   ``The law has foiled conspiracies against our religion (Islam)
and nipped the attack on our distinctive identity and
sovereignty,'' Ershad said without elaborating.

   Three fifth-graders accused of sexually
assaulting other boys in the school bathroom told police they were
mimicking things they had seen on cable television, authorities
said.
   The three boys, ages 10, 11 and 12, were arrested Wednesday on
one count each of sexual battery.
   ``They indicated they saw risque movies late at night on
cable,'' said police Sgt. James Mazer.
   The boys and the alleged victims are in the same class at Ida M.
Fisher Elementary School. Principal Paulette Martin alerted police
about the alleged attacks, which occurred during school hours
between January and April, Mazer said.
   ``We're talking perhaps six to nine victims, but we're really
not sure yet,'' said police spokesman Tom Hoolahan. ``We do know
that the victims are isolated within one group within the school.''
   The three alleged offenders were ``older looking and stronger''
and apparently coerced their victims into performing sexual acts,
Mazer said. The three acted as a group and also individually, he
said.
   ``We get victims as young as three months, but I don't remember
ever hearing of such young offenders,'' said Mazer.
   The two older boys have been placed in state custody, although
the 11-year-old already was in state custody on unrelated battery
charges, Mazer said. The youngest of the accused was released to
his parents' custody.
   ``I'm shocked because my son goes to that school,'' Victoria
Hernandez said. ``My son is only 8 years old and I'm afraid now for
him and for all the children there in the school. It's terrible.''
   ``They're not doing their job,'' said another parent, Victoria
Gomez. ``They're not watching the children the way they should be
watched.''
   James Fleming, assistant superintendent of Dade County schools,
said the school had the same security other public schools have.

   Leftist guerrillas fired mortars at the home
of U.S. Ambassador Alexander Watson, and one round struck the roof,
causing minor damage but no injuries, U.S. Embassy and police
officials said.
   Embassy spokesman Joao Ecsodi said Watson, his wife and their
infant daughter were in the two-story, colonial-style residence and
heard one mortar round strike the roof.
   ``The ambassador thought at first it was the backfire of a car.
It was not a big explosion,'' Ecsodi said.
   He said the 60mm mortar round destroyed a ramp and lighting
fixture on the roof. Ecsodi said there was no other damage.
   Police said at least three rebels fired three rounds at the
residence, but Ecsodi said the embassy was aware of only two mortar
rounds.
   Members of the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement left
fliers where the mortars were launched, about one block from the
residence, Ecsodi said.
   The fliers commemorated the death of a pro-Cuba guerrilla
leader, Luis de la Puente, who launched his insurgency on June 9,
1965. He was killed in combat four months later and his group
broken up. The Tupac Amaru band became active in 1984.
   The building is enclosed behind a 10-foot-high concrete wall.
The building and gardens cover nearly a square block.
   Ecsodi said Watson was having breakfast when the attack occurred
at 6:30 a.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT).
   Embassy officials did not say what happened with the other
mortar rounds, which apparently missed their target.
   In April 1986 the Tupac Amaru rebels exploded a car containing
130 pounds of dynamite at the side of the rear wall enclosing the
compound. The explosion damaged the wall but cause no damage to
residence.
   The ambassador then was David Jordan. Watson has held the post
since late 1986.

   Kitty Dukakis was released from the hospital
today, six days after delicate spinal surgery. She was accompanied
by her husband, Michael Dukakis, who clinched the Democratic
presidential nomination Tuesday night.
   Mrs. Dukakis, wearing a neck brace, said that she always knew
that Massachusetts General Hospital was ``the greatest hospital in
the world, and now I know why.''
   Her husband the Massachusetts governor, made no comment. He was
to accompany her to their home before returning to work at the
Statehouse.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 51, was in visible pain, but spent several minutes
thanking the doctors, nurses and hospital staff who treated her.
   She will have to wear a neck brace for several weeks, but said
her doctors told her she could take it off at the Democratic
National Convention in July on the night her husband formally
accepts the nomination.
   Mrs. Dukakis said Wednesday she was no longer experiencing the
numbness and pain she suffered for several weeks prior to the
operation to replace two herniated discs in her neck. But she said
her hip was very painful. Doctors removed bone slivers from her
left hip to replace the discs.
   ``It hurts, but I've been walking a lot,'' she said in a
telephone interview. ``I'm going to practice some stairs in a
little while.''
   Dukakis gained a mathematical lock on the nomination Tuesday
with victories in the final four primaries.

<TEXT>
   The oil-rich Persian Gulf states have
agreed to give the Palestine Liberation Organization a massive
subsidy to finance the six-month-old uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories, the PLO said today.
   Sources in other delegations at the Arab Summit said the amount
may exceed $100 million per year.
   Earlier, Saudi Arabia and North Yemen called on the Arab states
at the summit take Egypt back into the Arab League but were
rebuffed by the summit host, Algeria, officials said. The league
expelled Egypt after it signed a peace accord with Israel in 1979.
   The summit, due to close later in the day, was called primarily
to discuss the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. More than 200 Palestinians have died since the uprising
began Dec. 8. Two Israelis also have died.
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat initially asked the summit to provide
$600 million a year. He said the revolt cost the PLO more than $50
million a month in relief, compensation for wages lost by striking
Palestinians and medical expenses of injured rioters.
   The requested sum was reduced following negotiations among an
eight-member committee of delegation chiefs convened to seek
agreement on the subsidies as well as payments to Jordan and Syria
for costs stemming from the uprising.
   The committee included delegates from Algeria, Syria, Jordan,
the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the PLO.
   PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif denied news reports the summit
had rebuffed PLO demands for financial support for the uprising,
the most serious challenge to Israel since it captured the West
Bank and Gaza during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Delegation sources said the gulf states turned down Arafat's
initial request, claiming funds were limited by instability in the
world oil market and the effects of the Iran-Iraq war on oil
exports.
   They said the PLO later agreed to cut its request to $300
million to $400 million, but delegates of the gulf states said even
that was too much.
   There was no mention of Egypt during the first two days of the
summit, but Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal raised the issue
late Wednesday as a ministerial committee was drafting the summit's
final communique.
   Al-Faisal argued that since a majority of the Arab nations have
restored diplomatic ties with Egypt, it was ``counter-productive''
to keep the largest and most powerful Arab nation outside the Arab
League.
   Summit delegates, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Algeria and the moderate pro-Egyptian majority in the 21-member
league reached a compromise that would pave the way for Egypt's
possible readmission to the league at its next regular summit
scheduled for November in Riyad, Saudi Arabia.
   But Libya and Syria maintained their uncompromising opposition
to Egypt's readmission, the sources said.
   After intense backstage discussions, Algeria and Saudi Arabia
agreed to postpone the issue until the Riyad summit, they said. In
a compromise, Algeria agreed not to object to a proposal to be
presented at Riyad inviting Egyptian Hosni Mubarak to join the
meeting.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and Syrian President Hafez
Assad said they would continue to oppose the readmission of Egypt
for ``betraying the Arab cause.''
   Gadhafi angered some delegates by telling Arab leaders who
collaborate with the United States that they undermine the Arab
cause and should ``go to hell.'' He did not refer to any leaders by
name.
   Gadhafi wore a white glove on his right hand, and one Libyan
delegate said the glove was intended to ``avoid contact with a hand
that shook that of (Israeli Foreign Minister) Shimon Peres.''
   Morocco's King Hassan II received Peres, then prime minister, in
July 1986.

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Denies Aid to Blast-Shattered Nevada Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House space committee is
criticizing the Reagan administration for refusing federal aid for
the explosion-damaged Nevada town which makes a vital component of
the fuel that powers the nation's rockets and the space shuttle
booster.
   Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., asks how the townspeople of Henderson,
Nev. can be expected to drop their opposition to making the
volatile chemical ammonium perchlorate there at the same time the
federal goverment turns down a request for disaster assistance.
   One of the town's two ammonium perchlorate plants, operated by
Pacific Engineering and Production Company, exploded on May 4,
killing two people, injuring hundreds and causing $73 million in
damage. The second plant, operated by Kerr-McGee Corporation, was
shut down after the explosion, reopened briefly and closed again
after Gov. Richard Bryan threatened to sue on grounds that the
facility was a safety hazard.
   A few hours after a hearing by Roe's investigations subcommittee
of the House Science and Technology Committee ended Wednesday,
Kerr-McGee announced in Henderson that differences with the Clark
County Fire Department had been ironed out and that the company
plans to resume production of ammonium perchlorate next week. The
fire department had found some safety violations and threatened
action.
   Together, the two plants were the only U.S. source of the
chemical, which is also used in dozens of rockets such as the
Trident, Peacekeeper, Minuteman, Titan and Delta.
   On Wednesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected a
request from Bryan for disaster relief for Henderson.
   ``Why in God's name would we not give them aid?'' Roe asked.
``It's extraordinary to me that here we are looking for the
cooperation that we need desperately now with the good authorities
in Nevada and we are coming back and saying `Too bad, you can
rebuild your own libraries, rebuild your own schools, we want to
get the most production out of this facility, but we're not going
to do anything to help you.'''
   Richard Truly, the head of NASA's space shuttle program,
responded that while the probleble of producing 40
million pounds of a major solid rocket fuel component called
ammonium perchlorate. Kerr-McGee can produce 36 million pounds.
   The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Wednesday that the Pacific
Engineering plant had been cited by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration for 123 health and safety violations since
1974. Company spokeswoman Connie Richardson declined to comment on
the report.
   Truly told the House committee that NASA has four sets of
booster rockets on hand and if the fuel shortage continues next
year some flights will have to be dropped.
   He said Morton Thiokol, which builds the rockets, ``will be in a
position'' in mid-June to direct Pacific Engineering to build a new
facility capable of producing 30 million pounds of fuel a year.
That, he said, could be accomplished within six months to eight
months, with some added time for testing.
   The money for the plant, Truly said, would come from a 5 cents
per pound surcharge on the fuel. The same method might be used to
expand Kerr-McGee's facility.
   ``Our first and foremost effort,'' Truly said, ``must be to
safely but as quickly as we possibly can, to get Kerr-McGee
production back in place. We must rebuild our lost capability and
we have moved out to do so.''
   The committee was told that demand for ammonium perchlorate
would rise from 37.8 million pounds this year to more than 60
million pounds in 1989. The bulk of the fuel would be used by NASA,
the Army, Navy and Air Force and the rest for commercial, export
and other uses.
   Truly also said NASA was weighing options for fixing and using
six sets of booster rockets remaining from before the Challenger
accident in January 1986. Those rockets have the same flaws in the
joints that doomed the Challenger.
   ``We are seriously thinking about how those boosters would be
used,'' Truly said. ``It would be very premature as to what options
we may have.''
   Each set of shuttle boosters uses 1.7 million pounds of ammonium
perchlorate.

<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Paul Newman today denied
promising stock or profits from his food business to a Westport
delicatessen owner.
   The 63-year-old president and founder of Newman's Own Inc.
testified that the idea for the company's salad dressing, its
recipe, label and packaging were his.
   A few other people were involved, Newman said, but he insisted
that deli owner Julius Gold was not among them.
   Gold has alleged that an attorney for Newman promised him 8
percent of the stock from Newman's food company in return for
helping Newman's Own.
   Gold has said he contributed 30 months' effort to Newman's
company and believed that his ``judgment and perseverance ... led
to the success of this corporation.''
   Newman's Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn, has donated $15 million to charity since 1982 and
helped create a camp for seriously ill children in northeastern
Connecticut, which opened last week.
   Newman joked on the stand that he declined requests from state
Democrats that he run for the U.S. Senate because he wanted to be
the ``Salad King of New England.''

   Michael Dukakis took his wife home from the hospital, met with
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and got back to work at the
Massachusetts Statehouse today in his first day back in Boston
after sewing up the Democratic presidential nomination.
   His presidential campaign focused on choosing a running mate.
   Vice President George Bush, the all-but-certain Republican
nominee, was opening his post-primary campaign with a trip to
Texas, grateful for new words of support from President Reagan who
said Wednesday he would do ``everything I can'' to help Bush win.
   Dukakis, who has strongly criticized Reagan administration
policies in Latin America, praised Arias' peace plan for Central
America and said the United States must ``develop a new
relationship based on respect'' with the region's areas.
   Arias sidestepped a question about the U.S. elections, saying
only that he would be a ``good friend of whoever you decide to
elect in November.''
   Dukakis then went to the hospital where his wife Kitty was
released six days after undergoing spinal surgery.
   Mrs. Dukakis wore a neck brace and appeared to be in some pain.
She said her doctors told her she could take the brace off at the
Democratic National Convention in July on the night her husband
formally accepts the nomination.
   Dukakis, whose victories in the final four primaries of the
season on Tuesday gave him the delegates he needs for a
first-ballot victory at the convention, received a round of support
from onetime opponents on Wednesday.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, Sen. Paul Simon and former Arizona Gov.
Bruce Babbitt all weighed in with endorsements Wednesday. And New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, the most speculated-about non-candidate of
the year, finally lent his backing, although it wasn't exactly the
flowery tribute traditionally offered on such occasions.
   ``I endorse him! I endorse him! I endorse him!'' an exasperated
Cuomo said after persistent questioning by reporters. ``There,
three times I endorsed him.''
   Even though the nomination is numerically his, Dukakis is still
engaged in a duel of sorts with Jesse Jackson, the second-place
finisher in the primary sweepstakes.
   Jackson says he'll continue his campaign up until the
convention. And he has put Dukakis on notice that he wants to be
offered the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   The Massachusetts governor has said he'll consider Jackson as a
possible running mate. But Jackson says consideration alone won't
do it.
   ``Consideration means an offer. It does not mean just in
passing,'' he said Wednesday. ``The vice presidency is not the top
but it is a long way from where I started.''
   Dukakis kept to what has become his stock line on the subject _
that Jackson himself has said it's the nominee's decision to make.
   ``I'm going to cast my net far and wide,'' he said, adding that
he hoped to have ``a very good idea'' prior to next month's
convention of whom he wants for a running mate.
   Jackson was spending a few days at a California resort, resting
and talking to advisers. He waged a grueling primary campaign,
seldom missing a day of stumping.
   Bush, on the other hand, was heading back out on the trail
today. He was traveling to Houston, where he was to address the
Texas state GOP convention.
   Like Dukakis, Bush was seeing former rivals line up behind him.
Three of them _ Bob Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp and television evangelist
Pat Robertson _ were joining him on Friday at a ``Unity '88''
conference in Denver.
   On Wednesday, Bush met with Reagan, who pledged afterward he
would campaign hard for his vice president and do ``everything I
can'' to keep the White House in Republican hands.
   ``George, wait until you and I get out there on the trail, and
start pinning him (Dukakis) down on things he claims, which we know
are not true,'' the president said.
   As Bush has been doing in recent days, Reagan accused the
Democrats of being too pessimistic.
   If he listened to Dukakis, the president said, ``I would be
convinced that we're in an economic downturn, and that people are
homeless, and that people are going without food and medical
attention, and that we've got to do something about the
unemployed.''
   Dukakis responded, ``Good jobs and affordable housing and health
insurance for working families are what the American dream is all
about.''
   ``We can do a lot better than we've been doing to make that
dream come true for every citizen in the land,'' the governor said
in a statement released by his campaign.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked today about
Reagan's remark, said, ``The president believes the homeless is a
very serious problem, but what he was saying yesterday is that
Dukakis is the prophet of doom and gloom and always uses the
homeless as an example of how everything is going wrong in
America.''
   Bush has been saying he is unworried by recent polls suggesting
he trails Dukakis. He insists he relishes the underdog's role.

   An East German trade official based in
West Germany has defected along with his wife and son, a West
German government official said Thursday.
   The official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that 42-year-old Klaus Gruetzmacher, who was
employed by the East Germans as a trade expert in Duesseldorf, had
defected.
   The official also confirmed details of the defection contained
in a report by the mass-circulation Bild tabloid. The Bild report,
which is to appear in newspaper's Friday editions, was telexed in
advance to other news media.
   Bild said Gruetzmacher's wife, Hannelore, who worked for an East
German trucking company in Hamburg, and his son Jens, a member of
the East Berlin Comic Opera, had also defected to the West.

   ``Cry Freedom,'' a film about
the death in detention of black consciousness founder Steven Biko,
will be shown in South African theaters next month, the
distributors said Thursday.
   The Richard Attenborough film, nominated for three Academy
Awards, was to have been shown in South African theaters in April,
but the distributors, United International Pictures, withdrew it
because of fears of prosecution.
   The film is based on a book by Donald Woods, a white South
African newspaper editor who fled the country after Biko's death in
1977.
   Woods is a ``banned'' person in South Africa and cannot be
quoted, but the film was passed without cuts by the government's
censorship body, the Publication Appeals Board.
   The movie uses direct quotes from Woods, and the distributors
had placed advertisements in South African newspapers quoting him.
   Peter Dignan, United International spokesman in Johannesburg,
said he was given orders from London to place the film in 30
cinemas nationwide on July 29.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis met today with Costa
Rican president Oscar Arias and said the United States must
``develop a new relationship based on respect'' with Latin American
leaders. His presidential campaign focused on choosing a running
mate.
   Dukakis praised Arias' peace plan for Central America and said
the U.S. government should consult frequently with leaders of the
troubled region. Arias sidestepped a question about endorsing the
certain Democratic nominee, saying only that he would be a ``good
friend of whoever you decide to elect in November.''
   Dukakis attended the Harvard University commencement, where
Arias was to give the main address, and was at wife Kitty's side as
she was released from Massachusetts General Hospital. Mrs. Dukakis
is recovering from spinal surgery a week ago.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis placed Paul Brountas, his senior adviser
and friend since law school, in charge of his vice presidential
selection process.
   ``He was the guy with the ideas,'' Brountas said of the
Massachusetts governor. ``We talked about timing, how to go about
developing the process, getting moving, how we're going to do it.''
   Dukakis stopped in St. Louis along the way to receive the public
backing of a defeated rival, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. Two other
rivals also clambered aboard the Dukakis bandwagon _ Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona. And he got
the backing of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo as well.
   ``We clashed from time to time, but that conflict, that trying
and testing of ideas and energies, can only be good for the party
and for the nation,'' Gephardt said.
   Dukakis picked up 27 Missouri delegates along with Gephardt's
backing, and Simon released the delegates he had won. But it hardly
mattered.
   Dukakis had gained a majority of delegates with his two-to-one
victory in California, bringing down the curtain on a race for the
nomination that had long since lost its suspense.
   At his first news conference since gaining a mathematical lock
on the nomination, Dukakis rejected Jackson's assertion that he had
earned the right to choose whether he would join Dukakis on the
ticket.
   ``He deserves consideration. He's done a very impressive job in
running his campaign,'' Dukakis said. ``But there are other people
who will be considered as well, and it's up to the nominee to make
that selection.''
   He said his top priority would be selecting a ``first-rate''
candidate who could assume the presidency if needed, and said
traditional political considerations such as geographic region or
ideology were of less importance.
   ``Other considerations obviously are not irrelevant, but they
pale by comparison,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I'm going to cast my net far and wide,'' he said. ``It is best
to begin with as large a group as possible.''
   He said he hoped to have ``a very good idea'' of who his running
mate would be before the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
in mid-July.
   Brountas said no formal search committee was planned, and that
he would discuss the selection with top campaign staff members and
consult with political, business and labor leaders.
   Brountas also said ``I'm sure'' Jackson would be among those
consulted.
   Dukakis was asked if any women were on his list, and replied,
``There's no list.''
   He said there was no ideological or issue litmus test. ``I'm not
looking for a clone,'' he said.
   Dukakis turned briefly to the fall campaign against Republican
nominee-to-be George Bush, taking issue with the vice president's
comparison of this election race to the 1972 campaign between
George McGovern and Richard Nixon.
   ``That's nonsense,'' Dukakis told a television interviewer.
``This isn't Nixon-McGovern, and it's not FDR-Hoover. This will be
a campaign between two individuals, both of whom have been in
public life for a long time.''
   When Dukakis returned home on Wednesday night, he was greeted by
a crowd of about 75 people, most of them campaign workers in his
Boston headquarters.
   He arrived several hours late after being delayed in St. Louis
by severe thunderstorms.
   ```Here I am the nominee. I can't do anything about the
weather,'' he joked.
   He thanked the campaign workers for their support and help,
saying: ``You have helped to teach me, and I'm very grateful to all
of you.''

   A man received a two-year jail sentence Thursday
for threatening to contaminate meat with AIDS-infected blood unless
one of Britain's large grocery store chains paid him $135,000.
   Unemployed Arthur Adams, 40, wrote to J. Sainsbury PLC in
November demanding the money, claiming he represented a man
suffering from AIDS, prosecutor Martin Heslop told Old Baiey
Central Criminal Court.
   Sainsbury's contacted the police and Detective Chief Inspector
Graham Clifford, posing as a store representative, started
negotiations with Adams.
   Clifford's numerous phone calls led first to Adams' dropping his
demand to more than $70,000 and then to his arrest when he tried to
collect the money.
   ``I was at the end of my tether,'' Adams was quoted as telling
police.
   ``My mind was twisted with hatred and depression ... I had no
reason for choosing Sainsbury's. It could have been anyone. I never
had any AIDS samples or knew anyone with the disease. It was merely
a confidence trick.''

   A high school senior says administrators
apparently misinterpreted his comments in deciding to cancel
graduation ceremonies and final exams for fear that students would
carry out a suicide pact.
   Neal Loeslein, 18, denied the existence of a suicide pact or
other plans for violence among students at Fairview High School.
   ``There wasn't one. That was just a rumor,'' he said in today's
Pittsburgh Press.
   Loeslein told the newspaper he was the student present at
Christmastime at the home of another senior who fatally shot
himself in the head with a handgun in this affluent Lake Erie
suburb of about 7,500 people.
   He said that talk of a suicide pact surfaced soon afterward and
that the talk apparently intensified two weeks ago when he told
classmates in a general way, ``This is a graduation we will all
remember.''
   Loeslein said he had planned to play out a practical joke at the
ceremony but had not decided on the joke.
   He accused administrators of spreading rumors. ``They built all
of this out of nothing,'' he said.
   Officials on Tuesday canceled baccalaureate ceremonies scheduled
for today and graduation ceremonies scheduled for Sunday for about
150 seniors, saying they have evidence of a suicide pact among
friends of the dead student.
   Officials said another, similar handgun was stolen from the dead
student's home.
   ``It's more than just pranks,'' said school Solicitor Frank
Kroto. ``It's more than the typical end of the year dissatisfaction
with authority.''
   Administrators, who spoke to the Erie Morning News on condition
they not be identified, said consultants determined at least two
students involved in the alleged suicide pact were indeed suicidal.
   Kroto also said several school administrators also received
personal threats and are under police protection. He gave no
details.
   State police Cpl. James Scheig said law enforcement authorities
are not investigating the alleged threats of violence or the
possibility of suicides. He said some administrator's homes were
being checked periodically.

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government
outlined a plan today that could lead to a lasting cease-fire in
its six-year civil war with U.S.-backed rebels.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister, released a timetable
to free imprisoned rebels and former national guardsmen, to discuss
democratic reforms and to disarm the rebels, known as Contras.
   The plan, if approved by the Contras later today, would begin
Friday with the release of 200 former national guardsmen.
   ``They (the Contras) asked for the timetable and now they don't
have any pretext not to sign'' a peace agreement, said Paul
Reichler, a Washington attorney who is on the Sandinista
negotiating committee.
   Ortega released the plan at a news conference and said he was
giving it to Contra negotiators. There was no immediate comment by
Contra leaders.
   Under the plan, Contra combatants should begin moving into seven
determined zones and Sandinista troops will move out of those areas
on June 16.
   On July 12, the Contras could relieve ``exclusively humanitarian
aid'' and eight Contras can take part in internal talks with the
political opposition in Managua. On the same day, the government
would begin 60 days of talks on democratic reforms.
   At the end of that period, the Contras would begin disarmament,
Ortega said. By Oct. 10, Contras would leave the zones and
disarmament would be completed.
   On the same date, the Contras can receive ``exclusively
humanitarian aid.'' Also, eight Contra representatives can take
part in internal talks with the political opposition parties in
Managua. Also, 50 percent of the Contra prisoners will be freed and
400 ex-national guardsmen will be freed.
   The Contras had agreed to extend a truce that began on March 21
until today. It was not immediately clear whether the fighting,
which has killed more than 26,000 people would start again.
   The Sandinistas say they will unilaterally observe a truce until
June 30.
   The rebels accused the Sandinistas of being evasive about when
promised democratic reforms would be enacted.
   ``In our view, a concrete result depends on the political
goodwill of the government,'' Matamoros said.
   The Contras complained that the government postponed until today
a meeting that had been planned Wednesday afternoon with leaders of
Nicaragua's opposition political parties.
   The meeting would be the first time Contra leaders would be
allowed to hold political talks with the internal opposition groups.
   Meanwhile, the Sandinista police Wednesday rounded up 14
political opposition figures for staging an ``unauthorized march.''
They were detained briefly, then released.
   The demonstration was called to protest a law that has enabled
the Sandinistas to close radio stations for broadcasting what the
government claims to be misinformation or unconfirmed news about
the war or military draft.
   Among those detained were Erick Ramirez, president of the Social
Christian Party, and Agustin Harquin Anaya, president of a faction
of the same party.
   Negotiators for the government and the rebels differ on amnesty
for political prisoners, political representation in national talks
and disarmament.
   Matamoros said the Contras on Wednesday prepared a list of the
names of 4,207 political prisoners in 37 Sandinista jails. The
government claims there are 3,100 such prisoners.

   People who arrange surrogate births for a
profit would face up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine
under legislation approved today by the Michigan House.
   Representatives voted 90-10 to outlaw pregnancy-for-pay
contracts as being unenforceable and contrary to public policy.
   However, the legislation would let a woman in a surrogacy
agreement be compensated for her expenses. She also could accept
gifts from the contracting couple, as long as it's clear the gift
didn't amount to the buying of a child.
   The legislation would guarantee that in the case of a custody
dispute the baby would remain with its mother until a judge
determined whether it was in the child's best interest to give
custody to the father.
   The Senate is expected to give final approval, said Sen. Connie
Binsfeld.

   A military transport plane was
practicing touch-and-go landings before it crashed and burned in a
fireball, killing the six Air National Guardsmen aboard,
authorities and witnesses said.
   The last two bodies were pulled from the wreckage of the C-130
turboprop this morning, said Col. Dennis Wood, a spokesman for the
Air Force Base in Little Rock, Ark., where the plane was based.
   The plane was about a mile short of the Greenville Municipal
Airport runway when it crashed Wednesday afternoon. Workers used
lights to search through the night for bodies.
   Witnesses said the plane appeared to veer to its left as it was
landing and crashed into a clearing near the runway.
   ``I didn't see it come down. When I saw it, it was a just a big
fireball,'' said Reggie Kellems, who was driving a tractor about
100 yards away. ``There was debris flying all up in the air.''
   Military authorities sealed off the area shortly after the crash.
   Air Force officials said the plane was on a training mission.
   ``They had been with us for some time doing touch-and-go
training landings,'' said Richard Brewer, air traffic manager at
the northeast Mississippi airport. ``The plane was in the pattern
and the first we knew something was wrong was when it impacted.''
   Air Force officials said they couldn't confirm that it was
practicing a touch-and-go landing when it crashed.
   In September 1986, a C-130 practicing touch-and-go landings
crashed at Fort Campbell, Ky., killing three of the five National
Guardsmen aboard. A survivor said the plane had lost an engine. In
June 1987, three Navy aviators died when their EA-3B Skywarrior
electronic warfare jet crashed during a touch-and-go drill at
Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego.
   In touch-and-go drills, a pilot allows the plane's wheels to
briefly touch the runway before taking off again. The drills often
simulate a ground drop in combat conditions, in which cargo would
be dumped out of the moving plane.
   Maj. Jim Bates, a spokesman at Little Rock Air Force Base, said
the aircraft was assigned to the 189th Tactical Airlift Group of
the Arkansas Air National Guard.
   He said it is not unusual for members of the Arkansas Air
National Guard to be on training missions out of state.
   Wood said guardsmen from other states train at the air base,
where 81 of the large planes are stationed.
   A spokeswoman for the air base, Airman 1st Class Deborah Doyle,
identified the dead as:
   Maj. Andries R. Zwaan, 39, a pilot with the 189th Tactical Air
Lift Group at the Arkansas Air National Guard based in Little Rock;
Staff Sgt. David Bingham, 24, a member of the 181st Tactical Air
Lift Squadron at Hensley Field in Dallas, Texas; 2nd Lt. Mark R.
Brandt, 24, of the 180th Tactical Air Lift Squadron at Rosecrans
Municipal Airport at St. Joseph, Mo.; 2nd Lt. Thomas D. Leece, 28,
of the 934th Tactical Air Lift Group of Minneapolis, Minn.; Master
Sgts. Edwin J. Smith Jr., 35, and Danny W. Holland, 39, both
assigned to the 189th.
   Another C-130 from Little Rock arrived late Wednesday with more
than 40 crash investigators and support personnel.

   A fire swept through the domestic
passenger terminal at Sydney's airport early Thursday, but no
injuries were reported.
   The fire caused severe damage to a first-class lounge, the
terminal's roof and a baggage check-in area and forced hundreds of
workers and passengers to flee the building, a spokesman for
Australian Airlines said.
   The blaze started in an air-conditioning duct and caused
millions of dollars in damage, said the spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Flights were delayed for up to three hours by the blaze and
eight were canceled. The cause of the fire was being investigated.

   Assemblies of God ministers still
associated with defrocked evangelist Jimmy Swaggart as of Oct. 1
will lose their own credentials, the nation's largest Pentecostal
denomination announced today.
   Ministers working for Swaggart's church, television operations
or Bible school ``are being required to resign ... on or before
Oct. 1 in order to maintain their credentials with the church,''
said Assemblies spokeswoman Juleen Turnage.
   The 13 members of the Executive Presbytery headed by General
Superintendent G. Raymond Carlson made the decision Wednesday
during a regular meeting here, Mrs. Turnage said.
   She said she did not know how many Assemblies ministers were
still working for Swaggart but estimated the number at 80 or 90.
``Even when we had a relationship with Jimmy Swaggart we didn't
have a list of his employees,'' she said.
   On April 8 the Executive Presbytery dismissed Swaggart for
refusing to accept a year's banishment from the pulpit for an
unspecified sin. A prostitute has claimed the fire-and-brimstone
preacher paid her to pose nude in a motel room.
   The Baton Rouge, La., evangelist has since returned to his
pulpit.
   Jim Rentz, pastor of Swaggart's Family Worship Center, resigned
both his ordination and his position on the Assemblies' Louisiana
presbytery to align himself with Swaggart, according to Assemblies
ministers.
   Ray Trask stepped down as president of Jimmy Swaggart Bible
College rather than lose his Assemblies affiliation.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan began telephoning members of
Congress about a new trade bill Thursday as the White House
expressed concern over a Democratic parliamentary move in the wake
of the Senate vote sustaining his veto of a previous version.
   ``The will of the Senate was expressed yesterday ... and we are
proceeding to work with the leadership in developing a new bill,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``President Reagan is calling a number of members today to urge
them to proceed as rapidly as possible on a new bill and I think we
will be able to show some movement very soon,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman declined to identify the members the president was
calling but said they were ``the leaders who have been involved in
the development of this trade bill over a long period of time.'' He
said they included both Democrats and Republicans.
   The Senate fell five votes short Wednesday of the two-thirds
majority required to make the trade measure law despite Reagan's
objections.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a strong supporter
of the trade bill, voted against it at the last minute in a
parliamentary maneuver that could later allow him to ask for
reconsideration of the 1,000-page bill.
   Fitzwater said Byrd's action ``does complicate it and we
certainly are discouraged that he would try to do that. It is
certainly clear that the president wants a trade bill; the
Republicans want a trade bill; the Democrats, most of them, want a
trade bill; and we would like to see it proceed as quickly as
possible.''
   Byrd, in announcing his action, said, ``This is insurance that
the American people can still have a trade bill this year.'' He
argued that efforts to draft a new measure could become hopelessly
bogged down in debate over complex amendments.
   The bill Reagan vetoes would have overhauled the government's
system for imposing import curbs to aid U.S. industries and
retaliate against trade violations.
   Reagan objected to a provision to require companies with 100
employees or more to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs.

   A woman has been sentenced to life in prison for
the beating deaths of her AIDS-infected, heroin-addicted infant
twin sons.
   ``The human soul is capable of evil acts,'' Judge Michael Sapala
said Wednesday in sentencing Linda Diane Cannon, 30, of Detroit.
   Sapala, in a non-jury trial, convicted Cannon two weeks ago of
second-degree murder in the deaths of Shawn and DeShawn. The
4-month-old babies died of skull fractures induced by severe
beating in October 1987.
   According to testimony, both children contracted AIDS and became
addicted to heroin before birth from their mother.
   The twins were Cannon's ninth and 10th children. Seven have been
placed in foster homes, while the other died of sudden infant death
syndrome.
   Cannon's attorney, Robert Edick, said his client was unable to
handle ``the never-ending cycle of demands ... with twins.''
   Cannon told Sapala she was sorry and wanted to rebuild her life.
She will be eligible for parole in 10 years.

   A year after banning smoking in all
buildings, the Mayo Clinic is taking on a new pollutant _ microwave
popcorn.
   Employees cannot pop corn in breakrooms, and the clinic has
removed the microwave product from vending machines.
   The ban was prompted by complaints from patients who were teased
by the smell while fasting in preparation for exams, clinic
spokeswoman Meg Black said.
   ``The strong aroma would permeate to patient areas, and it
certainly wouldn't be fair to tell them they can't eat and then all
of a sudden have them smelling popcorn,'' Black said.
   ``I can sympathize with those patients,'' said Tom Elsen of
Jolly Time Pop Corn of Sioux City, Iowa. ``Our only hope is that
they return to good health in the future and again can enjoy
popcorn for themselves.''

<HEAD>West Bank Commander Sees Waning Revolt but Surge in Terror</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli military official said Thursday his
troops have quelled the Palestinian uprising against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip but now are bracing for
increased terrorism by a ``hard core'' of Arab youths.
   ``It took us more time than we expected,'' said Maj. Gen. Amram
Mitzna, but Israeli troops have ``gained back the deterrence that
we lost at the beginning of the intifadah'' _ Arabic for uprising.
   Mitzna, the military commander of the West Bank, spoke to
reporters during a visit to Washington about the 7-month Arab
revolt that has resulted in the deaths of 203 Palestinians and two
Israelis.
   ``There is no more high velocity of violence in the streets,''
Mitzna said. ``The situation is calming down.''
   The Palestinians' willingness to openly confront Isaeli soldiers
``is less and less,'' Mitzna said.
   Instead, Palestinians are resorting to ``pinpoint attacks'' such
as hurling firebombs at Israeli patrols, Mitzna said. He predicted
the Palestinians will turn more to bombs and guns rather than the
stones and burning tires that were their main weapons until now.
   ``A hard core of Palestinian youngsters is still there,'' Mitzna
said, although the majority of the population is tiring of the
revolt.
   Having failed to accomplish political gains in the uprising,
``it is a great worry for us that once again pure terrorism will
return'' as Palestinians seek recognition for their demands, he
said.
   The 1.5 million Palestinians in the territories captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war are demanding an end to Israeli
control and an independent state.
   Mitzna said the terrorism would be directed both against the
estimated 65,000 Jewish settlers in the predominantly Arab
territories, and against dense Israeli population centers.
   He predicted Israel will have to maintain higher than normal
troop levels in the occupied territories despite the returning calm
because ``I don't think we'll be able to go back to the status
quo.''
   Israeli intelligence has reported broad disagreement within the
leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organizaiton over the future
course of the revolt, he said.
   Some think the uprising should be stopped because of its failure
to achieve a political breakthrough and the high human toll it has
exacted, he said.
   Others in the PLO think the anti-Israel violence should be
escalated in order to drive a permanent wedge between the
Palestinians in the territories and Israel.
   Instructions by the Palestinian leadership to boycott Israeli
products, resign from Israeli-paid jobs and withhold payment of
Israeli taxes have had partial success which is now being eroded,
he said.
   He conceded that Israel still does not know who are the leaders
of the uprising.
   But he said the assassination in Tunis last April of Abu Jihad,
the No. 2 man in the PLO, will adversely affect the ability of the
organizers to continue their revolt. Abu Jihad, who is widely
believed to have been killed by Israeli commandos, was in charge of
operations in the occupied territories.
   Israel has also taken another step to crush the leadership of
the revolt by ordering the expulsion of Mubarak Awad, a Palestinian
with U.S. citizenship whom Miztna described as the theoretical
``mastermind'' behind the revolt.
   ``His deportation is first of all to cut his immediate influence
in the area,'' he said.
   The United States has asked Israel to reconsider the move, but
Mitzna insisted that although Awad did not have a role in
organizing the revolt, its leaders were translating his anti-Israel
writings into action.

   Glenda Brawley's home was
burglarized early today while the black woman was holed up in a
church to avoid arrest for refusing to testify about her daughter's
alleged abduction and rape by whites, police said.
   However, police this morning were told by Mrs. Brawley's sister,
Juanita Brawley, to cease their investigation of the break-in, said
Lt. William McCord.
   About $700 in cash was stolen from a telephone book in a book
rack at the apartment, which was entered about 1:40 a.m. by
breaking a pane of glass in a door and unlocking it, said McCord.
   ``I think that's the last place I'd look for money, the phone
book,'' he said. The break-in was reported by Juanita Brawley,
McCord said.
   The apartment was ransacked but there was no apparent damage, he
said.
   ``They told us not to take any fingerprints, nothing. We're
going to comply with their wishes,'' McCord said. ``That's the
farthest we can go without the further cooperation of the
complainant.''
   At the time, Mrs. Brawley, 33, was in a New York City church.
She was found in contempt of court and sentenced to 30 days in jail
Monday for refusing to cooperate in an investigation of the alleged
attack on her 16-year-old daughter Tawana.
   The Brawley family's lawyers contend law enforcement authorities
are engaged in a racist cover-up.
   Miss Brawley disappeared for four days in November and was found
wrapped in a plastic bag about 10 miles from her home. Some of her
hair had been chopped off, animal excrement was smeared on her body
and racial epithets were scrawled on her.
   In sketchy interviews with authorities, she said she had been
sexually abused by six white men, one of whom had a police-style
badge. A hospital found no evidence of rape.

<HEAD>Dukakis Carefully Draws Line Between Candidate, Governor Roles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was 9 a.m. and Tom Herman was out the door of
the Massachusetts Statehouse after an early morning meeting with
his boss, Michael Dukakis.
   Herman's time was up _ this was a Statehouse day for Dukakis,
who for 15 months has carefully juggled his dual role as
Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate.
   Herman, a top presidential campaign issues adviser, recalls
asking Dukakis to review position papers on health care and crime
on a day the governor was tending to state duties.
   ``Tom, Statehouse days are state business days,'' Dukakis
lectured him.
   ``It drives some people crazy, but that's Mike Dukakis,'' Herman
said. ``He has two more-than-full-time jobs now, and while it can
sometimes be very frustrating for us at the campaign, he feels very
strongly about Statehouse days.''
   Throughout his presidential campaign Dukakis, with few
exceptions, has spent at least two and generally three full days a
week at the Statehouse. Those Statehouse days mean campaign aides
have limited access to their candidate.
   Although he does use his Statehouse office for some campaign
staff meetings and receptions with visiting congressmen, such
sessions are infrequent and generally held either in the early
morning before state offices open or in the late afternoon.
   ``We respect his time as governor and will only interfere with
that if it is absolutely necessary,'' said campaign spokesman
Leslie Dach. ``Campaign folks always want more time for the
campaign, but he's got a big job here.''
   There are some obvious signs of the separation of governor and
candidate.
   Dukakis had a campaign-financed telephone installed in his
Statehouse office so that he doesn't call advisers, delegates,
supporters, congressmen and others on his state phone. Campaign
phones also were installed in the governor's press office and those
of his top aides.
   ``In fact I'm speaking to you on that phone,'' John DeVillars,
the governor's deputy chief of staff, said in a recent interview.
``Michael has a very cautious and careful and conservative approach
to making certain that his political activities are separate and
distinct from the exercise of his responsibilities as chief
executive. That's an approach that has marked his entire career.''
   The state each month charges the campaign for copying, courier
services and other campaign-related expenses it incurs.
   The careful bookkeeping is nothing new for Dukakis, who for
years has reimbursed the state whenever his state car has been used
to drive him to fund-raisers or to the supermarket. He also lists
such trips as income on his tax returns.
   But Dukakis now has a horde of campaign reporters following him
daily and it is inevitable that there will be some overlap between
his state duties and his candidacy. At recent Statehouse briefings,
Dukakis has set the ground rules: questions on the topic of the day
first before the media free-for-all.
   Sometimes overlap is deliberate; other times it is not.
   When Dukakis signs state legislation that he believes helps his
national candidacy, the words ``model for the nation'' frequently
flow from the mouth of the governor-candidate. He also is quick to
schedule photo sessions with visiting congressmen or dignitaries.
   But when campaign reporters are trying to make a national issue
of a state problem _ its current budget crisis or controversial
prison furlough program, for example _ Dukakis is equally quick to
link them to a ``national problem'' or cite his record of making
``tough choices,'' a stock line in his campaign stump speech.
   Other examples of overlap include the inclusion of a campaign
aide in the governor's scheduling meetings and increased demands on
Dukakis Statehouse aides to answer campaign-related queries.
   Dukakis also has used his gubernatorial stationery when sending
campaign-related letters to President Reagan, Secretary of State
George Shultz, other administration officials and congressional
leaders.
   The overlap also works the other way.
   While on the road campaigning, Dukakis lugs along two nylon bags
filled with state work, which he tends to at breakfast and while
traveling between campaign stops.

<TEXT>
   A child molester who murdered five boys
will die by injection after midnight tonight, barring any
unforeseen appeals.
   Arthur Gary Bishop, who has forgone further appeals, met
Wednesday with his parents, his lawyer and Mormon Bishop Heber
Geurtz and planned to spend his final hours fasting, said
Corrections Department spokesman Juan Benavidez.
   ``He seems to be preparing himself for what will take place, as
well as anyone can,'' Benavidez said.
   Bishop, 36, would be the third person in Utah and the 99th
person in the nation to be executed since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstituted capital punishment in 1976.
   Because Bishop wants to die and has been found competent by a
judge, civil rights groups such as Amnesty International and the
American Civil Liberties Union say last-minute friend-of-the-court
appeals are unlikely.
   Bishop fired his attorneys and said he would not contest his
death sentence further after the Utah Supreme Court rejected his
appeal in February. He has said he hopes his death will bring peace
to the parents of his victims.
   ``Art is resolute in his decision to go through with this,''
said his attorney, Walter F. Bugden Jr. ``He is as ready as one can
be to die.''
   Bishop was taken late Wednesday to a holding cell near the death
chamber. Utah law allows the condemned to choose between death by
lethal injection or firing squad.
   Bishop's oldest victim was 13; two were 4, another was 6 and the
other was 11. Two of the boys were drowned after being struck on
the head with a hammer, another was killed with a hammer, one was
suffocated and one shot.
   In taped statements to police after his arrest, Bishop, an Eagle
Scout and excommunicated Mormon missionary, said: ``I know I'm
damning myself to hell for doing it. I'm glad you caught me,
because I couldn't stop. ... I would do it again if I had a
chance.''
   He also laughed at several points during his confession,
describing to police how he ``did'' his victims.
   The lawyer said Bishop's spirits were ``not particularly high,''
but he did joke about closing out his $5 commissary account at the
prison.
   ``He said something about not wanting to overdraw the account
here because we already know there are First Security banks all
over hell,'' Bugden said.
   The money was given to his brother, Douglas Bishop, who is
serving a prison term for sexually abusing boys.
   The last execution in Utah was in August, when Pierre Dale Selby
was put to death for the 1974 torture-murders of three people
during a robbery at a stereo shop.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly passed legislation expanding Medicare to
help the elderly deal with the costs of serious illness received
favorable mention from the White House and the endorsement of Vice
President George Bush on Thursday.
   ``The president is very concerned about long-term health care,
as he has said a number of times,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said. ``We don't want to forecast the final action on
this bill, but we look favorably upon it.''
   Bush, who flew to Houston to campaign for the presidency,
endorsed the measure in a statement issued a statement through his
office.
   ``The legislation which passed yesterday will, for the first
time since the founding of Medicare, extend benefits for our
seniors,'' the vice president said. ``Now they do not have to live
in fear that their life's savings would be wiped out by a prolonged
hospitalization.''
   The legislation, the first major expansion of Medicare in 23
year, is more ambitious than the proposal originally laid out by
the president. However, Secretary of Health and Human Services Otis
Bowen has said he will recommend that Reagan sign it.
   The measure passed the Senate, 86-11, on Wednesday and was sent
to the White House.
   The new legislation provides a kind of safety net for Medicare
beneficiaries faced with extraordinary expenses from acute
illnesses such as cancer.
   It also introduces a general prescription drug benefit into the
Medicare program for the first time, applying to those who run up
more than $600 a year in drug bills.
   The expanded benefits are estimated to cost $32.6 billion over
the next five years and are to be paid by the potential
beneficaries through an assessment of $4 a month on Medicare
premiums of 32 million covered individuals.

   Corporate employees in New Jersey may know
the difference between a profit and a prophet but they might not be
able to spell it.
   That is the belief, anyway, of officials with the Olsten Corp.,
a national employment-agency chain based in Westbury, N.Y., which
is sponsoring the ``Olsten Corporate Great Grown-Up Spelling Bee''
beginning Saturday in Secaucus.
   ``There is a need to improve good, solid basic communication
skills, and spelling is obviously one of those skills,'' company
spokeswoman Mary Iorns said. ``Bees seem to be a really fun way to
draw attention to the issue of literacy.''
   The top 30 scorers on the written section of the bee will
advance to the oral finals on June 18.
   Representativs from about 80 corporations with sites in New
Jersey are competing, according to Olsten officials.
   Betty LaGrotteria of United Jersey Bank in Hackensack beat out
40 competitors in in-house bees for the right to compete Saturday.
   ``When the bank circulated the memo, it sounded like a fun thing
to get into and I always thought I was a good speller,'' said Ms.
LaGrotteria, 54, of River Edge.
   The grand prize is a trip for two to the Caribbean. Second prize
is a $2,000 scholarship and third prize is a $1,000 scholarship.

   It's acceptable for Rocky III
or Queen Elizabeth II, but not for Gerald Charles O'Hara Thompson
IV.
   So the 4-month-old boy doesn't officially have a name.
   It's all a question of numbers, as Colleen O'Hara discovered
when she tried to register her newborn's name 3{ months ago with
the British Columbia division of Vital Statistics.
   She wanted to upgrade him one number from his father, Gerald
Charles Thompson III. But she was told legislation prevents Roman
numerals from being used in names.
   ``That's the name I wanted,'' she said Tuesday. ``I want my son
to carry on his father's name.''
   District manager Franca Santucci said that if Ms. O'Hara wants
to continue the family tradition she would have to spell out the
Roman numeral, so the infant's name would be Gerald Charles O'Hara
The Fourth Thompson.
   ``I don't want his middle name to be The Fourth and that's what
it would end up being,'' Ms. O'Hara said. ``I'm not giving up.
Eventually he has to have a name.''

   Identical twin sisters came up winners
this week in Florida's Cash 3 lottery, unaware each had bet on
identical numbers.
   ``It's so weird,'' said Karen Snyder, 23, of Pompano Beach, a
first-time winner who earned $1,080 from her three $1 tickets with
the number 2-4-6.
   ``It's just a strange coincidence,'' said Kathy Snyder of Boca
Raton, whose single ticket paid $290. ``This is really the first
thing that ever came up exact for us.''
   The twins reacted the same way to their Tuesday wins, said their
father, Jim Snyder of Fort Lauderdale.
   ``I was on the phone with Kathy and a beep for call-waiting came
on the line,'' he said. ``It was Karen to tell me she'd won.''
   Both twins said they plan to spend their winnings on goodies,
travel and presents.
   ``That's pretty neat,'' said lottery spokesman Ed George.
``We've never had anything involving twins.''

   Jesse Jackson says the reporters covering his
campaign will be better people for the experience and should in
turn ``educate their bosses.''
   Jackson frequently criticizes the news media in his speeches,
telling voters not to be misled by reports that play down his
chances of winning the presidential nomination.
   But he suggests he's done plenty for the reporters, educating
them on American culture by taking them to the back corners of the
nation where he campaigned.
   ``I've taken media people to low places. I've taken them to the
ghettos, the barrios, to reservations. I've also taken them to the
high places to see the real America,'' he said.
   He said this week he has seen a shift in news media attitudes
toward his candidacy over the course of the campaign
   ``There has been an evolution in the media's consciousness and
in its maturity,'' he said. ``After all, the media leaders
themselves are bound by their own culture and they must grow and
expand.''
   ``Our campaign in some measure has been a factor in educating
many members of the media. Some have made better grades than
others,'' Jackson said. ``In the course of our campaign you have
seen a growth process taking place.''
   ``The people working on my campaign will be better people when
it's over. They'll be different people. They've seen more of
America than most Americans have. The media people working on my
campaign know more than their editors do, their publishers do.''
   These reporters now must ``educate their bosses,'' he suggested.
   He objected that news reports have raised the issue of his race,
and he said there should be more minority members and women in
positions of news leadership.
   ``I'm the stimulus. I'm the catalyst for that change. And one
day when you look into newsrooms you're going to see black, white
and brown publishers and editors, correspondents, script writers,''
he said. ``There must be a multicultural presence in that room to
have a multicultural result.''

<HEAD>Export Boom Fuels Best Capital Spending Outlook in Four Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses enjoying a boom in export sales
plan to modernize and expand at the fastest rate in four years, the
government said Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said a survey completed in May showed
U.S. companies plan to spend $435.2 billion on capital projects, an
11.9 percent increase over last year's spending of $388.8 billion.
   If realized, it would be the biggest gain in plant and equipment
spending since 1984, when spending shot up 16.6 percent as
businesses recovered from the 1981-82 recession. The rate of
increase would be seven times greater than the anemic 1.7 percent
gain posted in 1987.
   In 1986, investment spending fell by 2.6 percent as firms put
plans on hold while Congress rewrote the tax code. Spending had
increased a strong 9.6 percent in 1985.
   The new estimate, which is adjusted to remove the effects of
inflation, represents an upward revision from a previous survey
completed in March which had put the gain for 1988 at 8.0 percent.
   Analysts said the report was good news for the economy. Because,
the cheaper dollar has created more demand abroad for American
goods, U.S. industries need to increase their manufacturing
capacity in order to simultaneously boost export production and
avoid inflationary pressures.
   ``Manufacturing, especially in 1988, looks like it has very
aggressive plans. ... That's got to be good news,'' said David
Wyss, chief financial economist of Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass.
   Manufacturers expected to boost spending by 12.9 percent. Makers
of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or
more years, expect to boost capital spending by 11.6 percent, while
producers of non-durable products expect a 14.2 percent increase.
   Non-manufacturing firms projected an 11.3 percent increase, with
transportation companies predicting a 10.1 percent rise, mining
companies a 5.6 percent increase and utilities a 3.2 percent gain.
   However, Wyss warned that rising interest rates or renewed
trouble in the stock market could cause businesses to quickly scale
back expansion plans.
   ``People are still very nervous, especially after the stock
market crash. As result, any evidence of a slowing economy or
financial turmoil could have an even bigger effect than normal on
expansion plans,'' he said.
   Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Co. in
New York, sounded another cautionary note. Although increases in
capital spending are ``real and very solid,'' much of the
investment surge is going for high-technology items like computers,
telecommunications equipment, photocopiers and scientific
instruments, he said.
   ``We continue to feel that the bulk of this increase is not
showing up in any dramatic new construction of industrial
facilities, and that's where our capacity shortfall is most
notable,'' he said.
   More spending by businesses for high-technology equipment, much
of it imported from abroad, is probably bad news for efforts to
reduce the trade deficit, he said.
   The new survey, taken after businesses had the actual spending
totals for the first quarter, showed a 1.0 percent increase in
investment spending during the first three months of this year,
following a 3.8 percent increase in the last three months of 1988.
   Expectations for the rest of the year are for a giant 4.8
percent rise during the current quarter, a 2.2 percent increase in
the third quarter and a 1.8 percent gain in the fourth quarter.
   Roach said that pattern was consistent with the theory that
businesses are spending sooner rather than later because of
uncertainty about the stock market and interest rates.

<TEXT>
   Elementary school parents jammed a
principal's office Thursday after learning that three fifth-graders
were arrested for sexually assaulting boys in the school bathroom.
   The incidents took place between January and April, said police
spokesman Tom Hoolahan, and involved up to nine victims who in some
cases were forced into oral sex.
   The suspects _ ages 10, 11 and 12 _ were arrested Wednesday and
charged with one count each of sexual battery.
   Ida M. Fisher Elementery School Principal Paulette Martin
announced Thursday that the boys had been suspended, and denied
there were security problems at 830-pupil school.
   ``Everyone there says that there's security,'' said parent
Teresa Troy, among those at Ms. Martin's office Thursday. ``There's
no security _ they're lying and everyone's covering it up.''
   Another mother, Debra Allen, complained her daughter had come
home with a black eye earlier in the week, and school officials
knew nothing about it.
   The alleged offenders, described by police as ``older-looking
and stronger,'' were in the same fifth-grade class as the victims.
The teacher allowed groups of boys to go to the bathroom to
minimize class disruption, school officials said.
   The case was discovered Monday when one victim told a teacher
and Ms. Martin alerted police.
   The boys told investigators they were mimicking acts they saw on
late-night cable television, said police Sgt. James Mazer.
   ``The incidents are isolated to students in this one class,''
Mazer said. ``We don't know with what regularity the attacks
occurred. We believe they didn't happen every day, but a few
times.''
   The two older boys have been placed in the custody of the state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. The youngest
suspect was released to his parents' custody.

   A force of 800 firefighters closed the
noose early today around the fire that has scorched nearly 23,000
acres of grass and timber since Sunday on the Northern Cheyenne
Indian Reservation.
   Fire boss Al Kutt said he probably would declare the blaze
contained tonight and under control Friday night _ a day earlier
than he had predicted _ and might be able to begin demobilizing the
firefighting force on Saturday.
   ``It's looking great, really great,'' Kutt said.
   Four days of temperatures over 100 degrees and low humidity had
fueled the fire, but sudden cooling Wednesday night gave
firefighters a boost, Kutt said.
   ``I'm sitting here with a wool sweater on,''' he said.
   The fire was 98 percent contained by Wednesday night, said fire
information officer Michelle Ravnikar. Hot, dry weather and wind
gusts combined to double the size of the fire Tuesday night, when
it ballooned from about 10,000 acres.
   ``That's about the most extreme fire behavior I've ever seen,''
Al Kutt, incident commander, said Wednesday. ``It went bananas last
night.''
   At the most extreme points, the fire stretches about 10 miles
from east to west and seven miles from north to south.
   Crews came from Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and the Dakotas fought
the blaze. Officials have estimated the cost of the firefighting
effort at $450,000.

   A Czechoslovak Catholic activist who
published underground religious literature will stand trial next
week on charges of subversive activity, an emigre source reported
Thursday.
   The trial of Ivan Polansky, 52, will take place in Banska
Bystrica, central Slovakia, on Monday, said the source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Polansky, who reportedly suffered a heart attack before his
arrest, has been in custody for six months. The Czechoslovak
Committee for the Unjustly Prosecuted said Polansky has been denied
transfer to a prison hospital.
   He was accused in the indictment of ``publishing and
distributing unofficial religious and other literature.'' If
convicted, he could receive a maximum of 10 years in prison.

   The school board in this mountain resort has
decided to go into the real estate business to help employees live
in the community, where the average price of a house is $275,000.
   ``Aspen is a very expensive place to live. We want our teachers
to be an integral part of our community and not have to commute,''
board President Jon Seigle said Wednesday.
   The district, with an enrollment of just over 1,000, is
negotiating to buy a three-bedroom condominium and may lease a
house and rent it to a new administrator, he said.
   Officials also are looking at buying land and leasing it to
teachers to build homes, Seigle said. The board is working with the
Aspen-Pitkin County Housing Authority to acquire 10 to 15
properties in coming years, he said.
   In Aspen, the going price for a two-bedroom condominium is about
$1,200 a month, he said, while the school district's average salary
is about $2,600 a month.
   ``While Aspen is a very attractive place to come and work, it
causes us problems when we get a final candidate for a job and they
look at the price of housing,'' Seigle said.
   Some teachers and administrators commute 20 to 30 miles, he said.
   ``Every employer group is affected, from the person who is
trying to hire the dishwasher to the people who are hiring the
school superintendent,'' said Jim Adamski, executive director of
the housing authority.
   Costs for housing provided by the district will be negotiated in
future salary and benefit packages, with the teacher or
administrator paying the district rent, said Seigle.

   The House approved a two-year, $4.2 billion
spending plan for the National Science Foundation on Thursday after
trimming the measure down to comply with President Reagan's request.
   The bill, which continues programs that give government grants
to researchers, was approved 405-5 and sent to the Senate.
   The bill as approved by the Science, Space and Technology
Committee had envisioned $210 million more spending than the
president requested. By voice vote, the House approved an amendment
by Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., to cut that amount.
   The House also added a provision offered by Rep. James
Traficant, D-Ohio, giving domestic firms an advantage in bidding
against foreign companies for government science contracts.
   The bill included language prohibiting the science foundation
from spending money in cases in which employers have not taken
steps to ensure a drug-free workplace.

   Leaders of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany,

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan will address
the annual meeting of the Atlantic Council on Monday and his speech

North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
   Fitzwater said Reagan would address a joint dinner of the Empire

``undoubtedly will deal with the conclusions and results of the

   The spokesman said the two clubs are ``devoted to the flow of
ideas and the encouragement of public speakers on various national

   Reagan will return to Washington following the speech.

<TEXT>
   For Barbara Kirchner and her band
of die-hard anti-nuclear protesters, the vigil goes on outside a
rocket base despite the superpower accord scrapping medium-range
nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Ms. Kirchner, 21, vows to persist until the last of the missiles
leaves West Germany in 1991. But now she's under pressure from the
anti-nuclear movement to clear out of a house near the Mutlangen
U.S. missile base, 25 miles east of Stuttgart.
   For the past two years Ms. Kirchner has been the most outspoken
among the few remaining activists occupying the ramshackle building
200 yards from the entrance of the Pershing 2 missile site.
   ``Only about six to eight are regulars here anymore,'' Ms.
Kirchner said of what was once a group of more than two dozen that
occupied the house and regularly protested at the site after
missiles were stationed in November 1983.
   The house is owned by a peace group called the ``Peace and
Encounter Center,'' Ms. Kirchner said. ``Now (with the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty ratified June 1) they want
us to move out so they can use it to conduct seminars on
non-violent resistance,'' she said. ``But we don't want to leave
and we're not going to stop until everything is out.''
   In the months before and during initial deployment of the
missiles in West Germany, hundreds of thousands of West Germans
protested nationwide. As the first site to get the nuclear weapons,
Mutlangen became a focal point for demonstrators.
   Ms. Kirchner spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday during a
press tour of the site given by U.S. officials to explain how
verification and removal of the Pershing 2s in accordance with the
INF treaty would be conducted.
   About 100 protesters stood outside the entrance as reporters
were bused in, some waving, others holding up banners reading:
``Take the Toys from the Boys,'' or ``You Can't Have Both, Babies
and Bombs.''
   Within the West German anti-missile movement there are mixed
feelings about the results of the superpowers' INF treaty to remove
the Pershing 2s. Some see it as a victory, while others see it as a
propaganda stunt.
   ``It's being sold to the public as disarmament, when in fact
there are still thousands of air, sea and other nuclear weapons,''
Ms. Kirchner said.
   But she claimed the treaty shows her group has been successful.
   ``We have achieved something. The (West German) government will
find it very difficult to ever again take part in an arms
buildup,'' Ms. Kirchner said.

   A fire at a Chevron refinery was
extinguished Thursday after burning for nearly 20 hours following
an explosion at the plant.
   The fire began in a pump station at the refinery west of Port
Arthur on Wednesday morning and spread to some small storage tanks
nearby.
   Later Wednesday, some burning fluid began spreading along the
ground and into ditches, but was kept isolated, Chevron spokesman
Art Spencer said.
   Five people suffered minor injuries. And one firefighter was
admitted to a hospital for observation, suffering from dehydration
and heat exhaustion.
   Spencer said it was too early to determine what caused the
explosion.
   Crews located a valve believed to be feeding the fire with
unfinished gasoline and closed it off Wednesday afternoon, but the
fire continued through the night.
   Spencer said most of the blast occurred away from the main
manufacturing area and was not affecting all operations at the
plant.
   The refinery pump station moves hydrocarbons _ unfinished
gasoline _ from the manufacturing section to the storage area,
Spencer said.

   A man who allegedly rode his jet ski within
inches of a woman rafting at Lake Lanier has been charged with
manslaughter after officials said he literally scared her to death.
   Adrian Stanoiu, 36, of Norcross was arrested Wednesday on a
misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter charge. If convicted, he could
face a year in jail. He was released on $550 bond.
   Barbara Reyes, 40, of Norcross, who had a history of heart
trouble, was floating on a raft with her husband and friends at
Lanier Park Beach near Buford the weekend before Memorial Day.
   According to police, Stanoiu began riding a motorized jet ski
close to the shore. Fermin Reyes, Mrs. Reyes' husband, told police
the skier refused to move when Reyes tried to warn him away.
   His wife panicked when the skier came within six inches of her
raft, and she began paddling toward shore. She collapsed in a few
inches of water and died shortly afterward. An autopsy revealed the
cause of death as a cardiac arrhythmia brought on by fright, said
Gwinnett County Coroner Randy Simpson.

   Defendants were jailed in serious cases only
as the city struggled today to meet a court-imposed cap on its
prison population.
   The city had freed 180 inmates as of Wednesday afternoon, but it
was not enough to meet the limit of 3,750 prisoners by the court's
deadline of 5 p.m. Wednesday. That triggered a moratorium on the
jailing of inmates on minor charges.
   At midnight Wednesday, the count stood at 3,865, according to
Bail Commissioner Charles Murray.
   Under the court order, the moratorium is the only sanction
imposed against the city for failing to meet the cap, said William
C. Babcock, special court-appointed prison master. The order
contains no fines or other penalties, he said.
   District Attorney Ronald Castille, who unsuccessfully challenged
the population cap, criticized the city's decision to bail out
inmates.
   ``If the city puts up the bail, there's no incentive for the
person to show up,'' he said. ``If he wants to come in, he can. But
why should he?''
   A small group of Philadelphians cursed inmates leaving one jail
Wednesday, and people driving by shouted, ``Lock 'em up,'' and
``Don't let them out!''
   Terry Williamson, a spokesman for the district attorney's
office, said the order prevents the city from jailing all but those
accused of the most serious crimes _ murder or attempted murder,
rape or attempted rape, kidnapping, arson, robbery, aggravated
assault, or crimes involving a gun, knife or large amounts of drugs.
   Other suspects will be arraigned, given court dates and freed.
   Police will continue to make arrests without regard for the
prison population, said spokesman Detective Edward Tenuto. ``Police
will do their duty as they're trained to do,'' he said.
   U.S. District Judge Norma Shapiro on Friday ordered the city to
reduce the prison population to 3,750 inmates, 259 fewer than
Monday's total.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an emergency stay
at Castille's request but unexpectedly reversed itself Tuesday
without explanation.
   The ceiling was set in a consent decree the city signed in 1986
and originally was scheduled to meet a year ago. The agreement
stemmed from a 1982 class-action suit by inmates challenging
conditions in Philadelphia's four prisons.

<TEXT>
   The former manager of a plant
supplying bomb guidance components to the Air Force and Navy has
pleaded guilty to lying to conceal defects in the parts.
   Ralph Iadarola, 53, manager of the Courter Operations plant in
Boyne City in 1985-86, on Wednesday told U.S. District Judge Robert
Holmes Bell that he was aware of unreported test failures on
laser-guided bomb gyroscopes made by Allied Corp.'s Bendix Guidance
Systems Division.
   ``I literally shut my eyes,'' said Iadarola, currently of
Roseland, N.J. ``I knew of the problems, but I did nothing to
disclose the problems or solve them. This was wrong.''
   Iadarola was indicted in August on one count of conspiring with
six employees he supervised to defraud the U.S. government by
allowing the reports to be falsified and sent to the government. He
also was charged with 19 counts of making the false statements and
concealing facts from the government and with 14 counts of mail and
wire fraud.
   He pleaded guilty Wednesday to the conspiracy count and one
count of causing a false report to be prepared and facts to be
concealed from the Air Force.
   Iadarola faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000
fine on each count at sentencing Aug. 19.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas J. Gezon said Iadarola
pleaded guilty in exchange for the government's agreement not to
fight his request that he receive a sentence similar to those his
former employees received.
   The six men were each fined $5,000. Bell also ordered each to
perform 200 hours of community service and placed them on three
year's probation.
   The U.S. Defense Department has barred all seven men from
supervising military projects for three years.

   Broadway dancer Elizabeth Duggan has
died of cancer, less than a month after the death of her husband,
actor Andrew Duggan, relatives said. She was 56.
   Mrs. Duggan, who quit dancing professionally to raise a family,
died Tuesday at St. John's hospital, said her son, Richard.
   She began her career at age 17 after studying at the
Professional Children's School in New York City, her son said.
   She met Duggan while working with a touring company of ``Paint
Your Wagon,'' and the couple married in 1953.
   Duggan went on to become a successful character actor in films
and television. He died of cancer May 15.
   Mrs. Duggan's Broadway credits included ``Brigadoon,''
``Flahooley,'' ``Month of Sundays,'' and ``New Faces of '52.''
   In addition to her son, Mrs. Duggan is survived by two
daughters, Nancy and Melissa; her parents and a sister.
   A funeral service is scheduled Friday in Westwood.

<HEAD>From Interpreters To Vodka, Missile Bases Ready For Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GREENHAM COMMON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at this U.S. air base
are thinking of everything, from interpreters to miniature bottles
of vodka, as they prepare for a Soviet inspection of the base's 101
cruise nuclear missiles.
   At a half-dozen gates around the base, disheveled groups of
anti-nuclear protesters are waiting it out too.
   The protesters' smoky, littered tent and cardboard camps have
been at Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London, since 1981.
   It is one of the oldest of the ``peace camps'' set up at U.S.
facilities to protest the deployment of U.S. intermediate-range
missiles in Europe.
   Deployment began in November 1983 when the first missiles
arrived at Greenham Common.
   Under the superpower arms control agreement ratified June 1, the
900 missiles are being removed from bases in four West European
countries, along with around 1,800 Soviet medium-range missiles
aimed at Western Europe.
   But the protesters say they will stay on _ suspicious that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government and the United
States will simply agree to install some other deadly weapons at
Greenham.
   ``I doubt if ratification means much,'' said Sarah Hipperson, a
middle-aged protester who gave up a job and a regular home six
years ago to live outside Greenham Common. ``We are looking for a
whole conversion (away from nuclear weapons.)''
   On Wednesday, the U.S. military allowed journalists into
Greenham Common and two other intermediate-range nuclear missile
bases, at Florennes in Belgium and Mutlangen, West Germany, for the
first time.
   The previously closely shrouded weapons were shown off before
the arrival of the Soviet inspectors. According to the treaty, the
first inspections by 10-member teams will take place at 16 hours
notice in July or August.
   The inspectors will make ``baseline'' checks to verify the
missiles in place before dismantling. By 1991 all the missiles must
be gone, sent back for destruction under Soviet eyes at U.S.
facilities.
   ``What you'll have at the end of this is scrap metal,'' said
Greenham Common comander William E. Jones, indicating the 55-foot
missile launchers lined up beside the giant, grass-covered bunkers
_ from which they still make forays into the English countryside on
manuevers.
   ``When they've been, I shall feel very verified,'' said Jones,
46, of Memphis, Tenn., adding the treaty provisions were tight
enough to stop cheating by either side.
   The Soviet team, which can stay as long as 4{ days on any one
inspection visit, will remain on the base or be taken under escort
to the second cruise base in Britain, at Molesworth. Twenty-nine
missiles are deployed there.
   Lt. Col. Michael McCarney, project director for the inspection
arrangements, has collected miniature bottles of vodka for the
Soviets, and is piling up Sears, Roebuck catalogues _ a favorite
with a Soviet team that visited a facility in San Diego recently.
   Greenham Common, a U.S. air force base for most of the time
since World War II, has been part of historic events before.
   On June 5, 1944, the eve of the D-Day landings to defeat
Hitler's Germany, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower addressed paratroopers
of the 101st Airborne Division at Greenham Common. ``The eyes of
the world are upon you tonight,'' he said in words echoed around
the globe.

<TEXT>
   The world's most powerful particle
accelerator has passed its last major test and will begin operating
this September to help physicists explore the fundamental nature of
matter, its director said.
   The K800 cyclotron at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory was successful in accelerating a beam of atomic
particles to nearly 40,000 miles per second _ one-fifth the speed
of light _ and then directing it onto a stainless steel target.
   ``The K800 now will really move into a 10- to 20-year career as
a very important research instrument. This should really be the
world's center for heavy ion nuclear physics,'' said Henry Blosser,
co-director of the government-funded cyclotron laboratory at
Michigan State University.
   Blosser said the $10 million machine, which has been under
construction since 1980, would be ready to go to work in September.
   The laboratory will ask scientists from around the world to send
in proposals for experiments that will be evaluated by an advisory
committee, he said. About 75 percent of the experiments selected
will be done by American scientists while the rest will be
conducted by foreign researchers.
   Blosser said once experiments began, the cyclotron would operate
24 hours a day, seven days a week. ``Beehive is a good word for
what it will be like,'' he said.
   The energy of the test beam generated was 360 million electron
volts, but the machine is capable of accelerating particles to a
level approaching 8 billion electron volts.
   By comparison, the world's second most powerful heavy ion
cyclotron, GANIL in Caen, France, has accelerated beams to an
energy level of 4 billion electron volts.
   The K800 cyclotron, funded by the National Science Foundation,
can accelerate atomic nuclei as heavy as uranium, which is the
heaviest of the naturally occuring elements.
   ``In comparison with pre-1980s cyclotrons, it's like being able
to accelerate cannon balls instead of BBs,'' Blosser said.
   Sam Austin, the lab's other co-director, said experiments
performed on the machine could guide physicists to fundamental
rules governing subatomic matter. This in turn could lead to a
better understanding of cosmic events, such as the explosions of
stars or supernovas.
   ``It will be possible to see how nuclear material behaves when
it is compressed by the high-speed impact of one very heavy nucleus
on another,'' Austin said. ``This compression leads to extremes of
density and temperature as great as those that cause stars to
explode and led to the `Big Bang' that created the universe.''
   Physicists think that the universe began from a point of
incredibly dense matter that exploded billions of years ago and is
still expanding.
   Scientists generated the K800's first high-energy beam in
February, using its superconducting magnet to accelerate
electrically charged helium and carbon nuclei in a tight spiral.
Within the 7-foot diameter confines of the cyclotron's magnetic
field, the nuclei gradually reached a speed of more than 60,000
miles per second, or about a third the speed of light, 186,451
miles per second.
   The latest test succeeded in targeting a beam consisting of the
cores of heavier atoms.
   For their experiments, scientists will direct the beam into
other atomic particles. A complex array of electromagnetic
radiation detctors linked to computers will record the outcome of
the collisions.
   Physicists hope that by studying the effects of temperature,
pressure and energy of impact, they will be able to define
fundamental relationships governing nuclear matter and reactions.
   An earlier model of the K800, the K500, went into operation in
1982 and has been used by more than 275 scientists from 47
institutions.

<HEAD>Commerce Department Releases Adjusted Deficit Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department released new figures
Thursday showing that the country's huge trade deficits are
improving but not as quickly as previously believed.
   The department's new statistics for the first time in two years
adjust the monthly numbers for normal seasonal changes in shipping
patterns.
   With seasonal adjustment, the trade deficit for March turned out
to be $11.9 billion, 22 percent higher than the previously reported
$9.7 billion figure.
   The non-adjusted figure, the best showing in three years, had
been hailed by the Reagan administration as solid evidence that the
country's trade problems had finally turned around.
   The administration said the new figures still show an improving
trend, noting that the average monthly deficit for the first three
months of the year was $12.5 billion, compared to an average
deficit of $14.3 billion in the final three months of 1987, a
decline of 13 percent.
   The non-adjusted figures showed a sharper 21 percent drop from
the fourth quarter to the first quarter.
   ``The trade deficit is on a downward trend, exports are
increasing and it's a very encouraging picture in terms of the
foreign trade deficit,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater in an assessment that was echoed by private economists.
   ``The seasonally adjusted figures show that trade is slowly
turning and that should be the story for the rest of the year,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``There is no
reason to be discouraged by the new figures.''
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said the revised figure
had been anticipated, given the fact that U.S. export sales always
climb sharply during March and the seasonal adjustment would take
that into account.
   Most government statistics are adjusted to factor out
fluctuations which occur on a seasonal basis, such as the normal
drop in housing construction during winter months. But the
government was forced to abandon seasonal adjustments of the trade
figures for two years because of problems with collecting the data
on a timely basis.
   With that problem solved, the government will resume reporting
seasonally adjusted trade figures beginning with the April trade
report, scheduled to be released next Tuesday.
   Ortner said that the deficit so far this year is running at an
annual average of $150 billion, about what the administration has
been expecting. The merchandise trade deficit hit a record $170.3
billion last year.
   The annual figure for 1987 was revised slightly from an original
figure of $171.2 billion. The 1986 figure was also revised to show
a deficit of $155.1 billion. The changes in the annual totals
reflected more complete data rather than any effect from seasonal
adjustments which will not change annual totals.
   The February deficit, which had originally been reported at
$13.8 billion, was raised to $14.4 billion while the January
deficit, originally reported as $12.4 billion, was lowered by the
seasonal adjustment to $11.3 billion.
   Government statisticians hope that the seasonal adjustments, by
smoothing out the month-to-month volatility will ease some of the
extreme reactions financial markets have had to the monthly trade
figures.
   Bad trade figures were blamed for adding to the pessimistic mood
right before last October's stock market crash. Just two months ago
the original report on the February deficit, which was much higher
than had been expected, sent the Dow Jones industrial average down
by 101 points, its fifth worst loss ever.
   The seasonal adjustments will cover about 80 percent of U.S.
trade. One major exception will be oil imports. The government said
it could not detect any seasonal pattern to these shipments so they
will not be adjusted.
   Before 1986, the government had always adjusted the monthly
import and export figures to smooth out seasonal shipping patterns.
However, it was forced to abandon the practice when a tide of
imports overwhelmed the ability of the Customs Service to process
the trade information on a timely basis.
   In some months, the so-called carryover of late information from
previous months accounted for 50 percent of the new month's total.
That figure has now been reduced to around 3 percent per month.

   Eight homes were destroyed in the
Bosnian mining town of Tuzla when a 65-foot-wide hole opened
beneath them and escaping gas caught fire, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   No injuries were reported. A dozen people fled their homes
before they were destroyed by the 50-foot-deep hole in the
salt-mining town 90 miles west of Belgrade, the daily Vecernje
Novosti reported.
   Escaping gas caught fire at the bottom of the sink hole when it
formed around noon Wednesday. Authorites quickly put out the fire.
   ``It happened with a bang and when I looked through the window
all I could see was dust,'' Mensur Jasarevic, a Tuzla citizen, said.
   Ibrahim Imamovic, a professor in Tuzla, said underground water
dissolved salt deposits causing the earth to cave in.

not going to let him hurt her, or her hurt him either. It's a fun
bout.''
   Brennan needs $125,000 for his operation, said Mrs. Arnold. The
fund drive so far has raised about $55,000. The Bolins and the
McClures are acquaintances, said Mrs. Arnold.

   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh today
selected fired National Security Council aide Oliver L. North as
the first of four defendants to be tried in the Iran-Contra
conspiracy case.
   Walsh advised U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of his
selection of North, but also asked the judge to reconsider his
decision ordering separate trials for North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and Richard A. Secord.
   Walsh asked that Gesell order two dual-jury trials in which
North and Poindexter would first be tried together and Hakim and
Secord would then go to trial jointly.
   Gesell had ruled that trying the four defendants jointly would
prejudice their constitutional rights because of the inability to
use the defendants' immunized congressional testimony as part of
the defense.
   Gesell had ordered separate trials to allow one defendant, for
example North, to use Poindexter's congressional testimony as part
of his defense.
   ``The government recognizes the need to safeguard such rights,
but submits that there are ways to accommodate those interests
without imposing the tremendous burden of four sequential trials on
the government and the judiciary,'' Walsh said in a brief filed
with the court.
   Walsh said that two juries could be empaneled to hear a joint
trial of North and Poindexter without prejudicing each defendant's
constitutional rights. ``The evidence the government would offer at
separate trials of North and Poindexter and of Secord and Hakim
would be overlapping,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh said it would be logical to try North and Poindexter
together because they are accused of ``using their positions of
trust and power to facilitate and protect an illegal financial and
logistical network'' to divert U.S. arms sale profits to the
Contras.
   Secord and Hakim should be tried together, Walsh said, because
they are accused of operating an illegal enterprise ``to carry out
activities forbidden to the government.''
   Walsh explained how a dual-jury trial could protect an
individual's constitutional rights. ``When one of the two
defendants being tried together seeks to introduce the immunized
testimony of his co-defendant, the co-defendant's jury can be
excused from the courtroom, thereby protecting the defendant's
constitutional right not to have his immunized testimony used
against him,'' he said.
   Walsh had been given till Friday to notify Gesell which
defendant he wanted to proceed with first. In asking the judge to
reconsider his severance ruling, Walsh said that ``four separate
and sequential trials will result in at least some of the
defendants living under the cloud of an indictment for several
months.''
   ``The public has its own interest in a speedy resolution of the
charges against the defendants which may not be met if these cases
are permitted to extend over a period of years,'' he said.
   Legal experts say the Iran-Contra prosecutors were handed a
``worst case scenario'' when Gesell ruled that the defendants must
each be tried separately.
   ``It's like kissing a rattlesnake,'' said former federal
prosecutor E. Lawrence Barcella Jr. of Washington, describing the
ordeal of conducting what is essentially the same case over and
over again. ``It's not fun and usually injurious to your health.''
   The immunized testimony would likely be inadmissible in a single
trial, thus denying defendants their normal right to cross-examine
each other on their prior statements.
   The defendants have said the immunized testimony of the other
defendants before the congressional Iran-Contra committees would
show their innocence. Prosecutors cannot introduce the immunized
testimony of the specific defendant on trial as part of their case
against that defendant.
   The four defendants are charged with conspiring to illegally
divert profits from U.S. arms sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan
Contras when such assistance was banned.
   Gesell said either North, a former National Security staffer, or
Poindexter must be tried first. North is charged in 16 counts of
the 23-count indictment, while Poindexter is named in seven.
   The judge also said he had not made final decisions on whether
the congressional immunity, given to all defendants except Secord,
posed such a serious problem as to preclude trying the cases at all.
   He said he would decide that and other major pre-trial issues by
July 1 so he could set a date for a prompt trial.
   One legal source familiar with the case who would comment only
on condition of anonymity said the ruling could have one beneficial
effect for the prosecution.
   He said Walsh would have the right to call anyone convicted in
an earlier trial as a witness in a subsequent trial. If the four
had been tried together, the prosecution could not call one
defendant to testify against another.
   But Barcella, who handled major anti-terrorism cases as an
assistant U.S. attorney in Washington _ and his former boss,
ex-U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova _ agreed that on balance, the
ruling went against prosecutors.
   ``This ruins the prosecution's entire strategy,'' diGenova said.
``It's what every prosecutor dreads. It's the worst case scenario
for the independent counsel.
   ``Prosecutors wanted all four in the courtroom together,'' he
said. ``They wanted the entire conspiracy before the jury, which
could look at them, see the evidence against all of them, and weigh
the conspiracy against them.''
   In his ruling, Gesell said: ``Any defendant should have
considerable leeway to use indirectly ... and possibly directly
immunized testimony while defending the charges against him.
   ``Each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimony
revealed information which one or more of the defendants considers
helpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect'' of the
case, Gesell said.
   Separate trials are needed because trying the defendants jointly
would compromise each defendant's Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to challenge the
testimony through cross-examination, the judge said.
   The judge provisionally denied a defense motion to continue the
trials until after the November election, saying prospective jurors
would have to be questioned about whether political discussions
about the Iran-Contra affair would undermine their impartiality.
   The judge also ruled all the trials would be held in Washington,
denying defense requests that they be moved because of extensive
pre-trial publicity.

<HEAD>GOP Senate Candidate Blair Withraws From Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas L. Blair, Republican Senate candidate
who faced a stiff race against incumbent Democrat Paul Sarbanes,
said Thursday he is withdrawing as his party's candidate.
   Blair cited ``intense pressures and business events'' in a
letter dated June 8 to Daniel Flemming, state Republican Party
chairman.
   ``I regret my present inability to conduct a full-time campaign
to retire Mr. Sarbanes from the Senate,'' Blair, 43, said in the
letter. ``He should and can be defeated, but he won't be defeated
by anything less than a full-time candidate. To my great regret, I
find I simply cannot meet that responsibility.''
   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, state GOP national committeewoman,
and Jackie Phillips, a campaign official, had tried to persuade
Blair to delay the announcement until party leaders decide what to
do, The Evening Sun of Baltimore reported Thursday.
   Nelson Warfield, state GOP executive director, said Thursday
afternoon that no letter had been received at the party's Annapolis
office and as far as he was concerned Blair was still a candidate.
   Blair's office said he was unavailable Thursday and referred
calls to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee in
Washington, D.C. Blair's letter was released through that office.
   Blair, who has never run for political office, extensively used
radio and television ads in winning the March primary over eight
opponents. But he faced an uphill fight against the two-term
incumbent Sarbanes.
   A party source, quoted in The Evening Sun, said that the firm
that took over Blair's company, a health care management consulting
firm called Jurgovan & Blair, won't give him the time off to
campaign. Jurgovan & Blair became a wholly owned subsidiary of
American International Group in July 1986.
   Patricia Sutter, public relations manager for American
International in New York, said she couldn't comment.
   Blair had not voted for nearly eight years before re-registering
just prior to filing his candidacy last year. His only previous
activity with the Republican Party had been to head a fund-raising
club called the Eagles Club whose members make a $2,500
contribution to the party.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze said today that a team of Israeli diplomats will visit
the Soviet Union next month but said full diplomatic relations
cannot be resumed until Israel agrees to an international peace
conference on the Middle East.
   Shevardnadze made the statement to reporters after a meeting
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel. Both men described
the session as friendly and useful but without any breakthrough or
flexibility on either side.
   The Soviet minister also said emigration of Soviet Jews was
continuing. He said there were some constraints, which he
identified as ``military secrets only.''
   ``I would not call this meeting a new stage in relations, but it
was a useful meeting,'' Shevardnadze later told a news conference.
   ``If we can convene an international conference,'' Shevardnadze
said, ``that would make it possible to settle the problems of our
diplomatic relations.''
   Shevardnadze, asked if the Soviet Union would not restore full
diplomatic relations without a U.N.-sponsored conference, answered,
``Yes.'' He said a conference was the only way to reach a
comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem.
   Shamir told reporters the hour and 50-minute session was ``very
friendly, productive and useful.'' But he stood firm against an
international peace conference.
   Shamir told Israeli reporters that a consular team would visit
the Soviet Union in the second half of July and indicated it would
issue visas to Soviet Jews who wish to emigrate.
   A Soviet consular team earlier visited Israel and this would be
a reciprocal visit.
   But Shevardnadze, asked if the team would issue visas, said,
``No.''
   It was Shamir's first meeting with a Soviet official since 1984,
when he met Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. Shevardnadze has met
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who takes a more flexible
position on the Middle East.
   Diplomats said the meeting could signal a new warming of
Soviet-Israeli relations and reflected the increased Soviet
interest in improved ties and increased influence in the Middle
East.
   Shamir said it would be difficult for the Soviet Union to play a
constructive role in a Middle East settlement without having
diplomatic relations with Israel. The Soviet Union broke relations
during the 1967 Middle East War.
   The Israeli prime minister said the two discussed the Middle
East situation, the state of Soviet-Israeli relations, the problem
of emigration of Soviet Jews, the arms race and arms reduction.
   He gave no details but said, ``I think there will be some
further discussions on the same problems.''
   The Soviet Union sought the meeting with Shamir in its first
contact with the conservative leader. Shamir has opposed a Soviet
call for a Middle East peace conference and the exchange of
Israeli-occupied Arab lands for peace. Peres has been more
conciliatory.
   Israel favors direct talks with her Arab neighbors and officials
say an international conference is an excuse for not negotiating
directly with Israel. It says it will not accept any imposed
settlement.
   Israel is opposed to inclusion of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in any conference, while most nations regard the PLO
as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.

<HEAD>Yeltsin To Attend Conference That May Become Battleground For
Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist Party firebrand
and fallen protege of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has been elected to
attend a party conference where he and other reformers may square
off against conservatives over Gorbachev's reforms.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Thursday
that Yeltsin will attend this month's 19th Communist Party
Conference.
   The presence of the outspoken, acid-tongued Yeltsin, who was
ousted in November as Moscow party boss, may make for lively debate
at the nationwide conference, the party's first in 47 years.
   The election of Yeltsin to the party conference continues the
roller-coaster career of the 57-year-old Russian who was fired as
Moscow party boss and stripped of his post as a non-voting member
of the Politburo because of a speech he gave to the Central
Committee in October.
   Prominent advocates of Gorbachev's reform drive allege that
middle-echelon apparatchiks in the 20-million member Communist
Party have maneuvered to bar many Gorbachev allies from the meeting.
   The newspaper of the Moscow city party, Moskovskaya Pravda,
complained Thursday that ``election of the candidates has not
everywhere been conducted in the atmosphere of broad openness.''
The nominating procedure should be changed because some party and
non-party members ``could not voice their opinions,'' it said.
   The conference is considered crucial because it will consider
potentially radical changes that remove vestiges of Stalinism from
the Soviet political and legal system. Those changes could be in
doubt if conservatives dominate among the 5,000 delegates. The
conference is scheduled to convene in Moscow June 28.
   Among changes they will consider is a proposed limit on the
terms of Communist Party officials, who have been virtually assured
of lifetime tenure.
   However, a set of proposals approved by the party's
policy-making Central Committee, published on May 26, advocates a
limit of two five-year terms for all party officials, including
Gorbachev, the party's general secretary.
   Such provisions, as well as Gorbachev's campaign for
``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, threaten the
power and privilege of many party officials.
   The contest for election to the 19th Party Conference has been
like no other party balloting in memory, with disputes openly aired
in official media, a petition drive on behalf of one reformist
candidate in Moscow's Pushkin Square, and a street rally in
Leningrad that reportedly drew 1,500 people.
   Prominent pro-Gorbachev supporter Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a
sociologist, charged Friday that because of conservative
bureaucrats' maneuvering, ``the most pronounced advocates of
perestroika were not selected'' as delegates to the conference.
   That evening, the Moscow party leadership put Zaslavskaya and
some other outspoken Gorbachev supporters back on the ballot as
candidates to help fill the 319 delegate slots from Moscow.
Zaslavskaya and several others were not elected, but other
prominent perestroika advocates were, including filmmaker Elem
Klimov and economist Leonid Abalkin.
   The Politburo, the party's ruling body, acted Monday to make
sure the views of rank-and-file Communists are represented at the
conference, in an apparent move to further short-circuit the
influence of middle-level officials.
   In an official communique, the Politburo instructed local party
committees to collect proposals from the grassroots to to make sure
they will be taken up. Yeltsin's October speech criticized the No.
2 man in the Soviet leadership, Yegor K. Ligachev, and complained
that Gorbachev's program for social and economic change was moving
too slowly.
   He gave several interviews to Western television networks last
week during the Soviet-American summit, solidifying his reputation
for speaking his mind freely about highly controversial matters. In
one interview, he called for Ligachev to resign because he was
blocking reforms.
   A week after being fired from his Moscow party job, Yeltsin was
named first deputy chairman of the State Building Committee.
   Yeltsin was named a delegate from Karelia, an autonomous Soviet
republic north of Leningrad and near the Finnish border. Yeltsin
has no known contacts with Karelia, but Gerasimov, speaking at a
government news briefing, said there was no requirement in party
rules that a conference delegate live or work in the area he is
chosen to represent.
   By calling a party conference, Gorbachev is using an instrument
that was last used, and then discarded, by Stalin. The party's
nominally supreme body is the congress, which meets every five
years. The last party congress, the 27th, took place in 1986.

   It costs an average of $118,200 a year to
protect a federal witness and $35,500 to conduct a state or federal
wiretap, the Justice Department said Thursday in a report on crime
and justice.
   The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics also found that it
costs $13,200 a year to house a federal prisoner and that crime
victims who receive compensation under various state programs are
awarded an average of $3,000 apiece.
   The U.S. Marshals Service operates the witness security program
for 5,200 people who testify for the government in major criminal
cases and, facing possible reprisals, are given new identities and
relocated at government expense.
   Some $46 billion in federal, state and local taxes was spent on
both criminal and civil justice system in the United States in
1985, the report said, reiterating a figure published in an earlier
study.
   The data, based on information gathered from 1980 to 1986, was
issued at a news conference where Attorney General Edwin Meese III
underscored the impact of crime.
   Meese referred to earlier studies that showed almost every
American will be the victim of a theft during a lifetime and that
if crime continues at current levels, five of every six people will
be the victim of an attempted or completed crime of violence.

   The moves toward peace by Nicaragua
and the rebels stemmed from the regional peace plan signed in
August by the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Costa Rica and Honduras.
   The following is a chronology of the events in Nicaragua to
bring about an end to the nation's more than 6-year-old civil war.
   Nov. 6, 1987 _ President Daniel Ortega asks Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo to mediate indirect talks between representatives of
the Sandinistas and the U.S.backed rebels, known as Contras.
   Dec. 3 _ The first round of indirect talks is held in the
Dominican Republic.
   Dec. 21 _ The second round of indirect talks takes place, again
in the Dominican Republic.
   Jan. 16, 1988 _ Ortega, at a meeting in Costa Rica of the five
Central American presidents, announces direct talks with the
Contras mediated by the cardinal.
   Jan. 28 _ The first direct talks are held in Costa Rica.
   Feb. 18 _ The second round of talks last only one day and are
broken off by Obando y Bravo, who cites the lack of flexibility by
both sides. The Cardinal then calls for the talks to include
democratic reforms.
   March 2 _ After a series of letters between the cardinal and the
president, Ortega removes Obando y Bravo from his post as mediator
and calls for face-to-face talks. He names his brother, Gen.
Humberto Ortega, as the head of the Sandinista delegation.
   March 8 _ The Contras back out of talks set for the following
day, citing a lack of preparation. The two sides later agree to
meet in the southern border post at Sapoa March 21.
   March 21 _ The two sides meet face-to-face for the first time in
Nicaraguan territory. Each announces a halt to offensive military
operations.
   March 23 _ The Sandinista leaders and the Contra representatives
announce cease-fire plan.
   March 27 _ The first 100 political prisoners are freed.
   March 28 _ Technical teams from the Sandinistas and the Contras
meet at Sapoa again to work out the mechanics of the cease-fire.
   April 1 _ The formal truce begans.
   April 4 _ Another round of unsuccessful technical talks were
held at Sapoa.
   April 14 _ The third round of technical talks begins.
   April 15 _ The Contra leaders come to Managua for the first time
to hold three days of high-level talks with the Sandinistas.
   April 28 _ The second go at talks in the capital were held.
   May 26 _ Both sides meet for three days of meetings in Managua.
The Sandinistas offered a proposal following a Contra demand for
democratic reforms.
   May 31 _ The 60 day truce formally ends. The Sandinistas
unilaterally extended it until June 30. The Contras agree to
prolong the cease-fire until June 9.
   June 7 _ The two sides hold the fourth attempt at talks. The
Contras said they would not resume meetings if no agreement was
reached. The Sandinistas offer a compromise plan calling for
democratic reforms before full disarmament by Oct. 10.

   Federal health officials recommended Thursday
that all pregnant women be tested for hepatitis and that newborns
of infected women be vaccinated, to prevent 3,500 babies a year
from becoming potentially doomed hepatitis carriers.
   The Centers for Disease Control, which in 1984 recommended
type-B hepatitis tests for women in high-risk groups _ such as
injectible drug abusers and some venereal disease patients _ said
Thursday that many obstetricians don't know what the high-risk
groups are, and the plan has not worked.
   ``It is now evident that routine screening of all pregnant women
is the only strategy that will provide acceptable control'' of
mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission, the CDC said in its
weekly report.
   Each year in the United States, about 16,500 babies are born to
mothers with hepatitis B infections, the CDC said. About 3,500 of
those infants become chronic hepatitis B carriers, and it is
estimated that more than 25 percent of them will die of liver
cancer or cirrhosis.
   The CDC's Immunization Practices Advisory Committee now
recommends that pregnant women be tested for hepatitis B during an
early prenatal visit. If a woman is infected, her baby should
receive hepatitis B immune globulin, preferably within 12 hours of
birth, to provide immediate protection, and hepatitis B vaccine
within seven days and again at 1 month and 6 months.
   Such a routine is between 85 percent and 95 percent effective in
preventing a child from becoming a chronic hepatitis B carrier, CDC
researchers said.
   The CDC also recommends screening household members and sexual
partners of infected women and vaccinating them if appropriate.
   ``Hepatitis B vaccine is the first human vaccine that can
prevent both serious chronic disease and a uniformly fatal type of
cancer,'' the CDC noted.
   Still, vaccinating every newborn child in the United States for
hepatitis B is not practical from a cost standpoint, said Dr. Mark
Kane, a CDC hepatitis specialist. A child's vaccine regimen costs
$60 or more, he noted.
   Hepatitis B is one of the two most common forms of hepatitis, a
serious inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B is transmitted
chiefly in the blood. There is not yet a vaccine for hepatitis A,
which is most commonly associated with poor hygiene.
   About 25,000 cases of each type occur in the United States each
year.
   High-risk groups for hepatitis B include injectible drug users,
homosexually active men, heterosexuals with multiple episodes of
venereal disease and medical personnel exposed to blood on the job.
   The CDC previously recommended hepatitis B tests for high-risk
women, but ``major problems have been encountered in implementing
these recommendations,'' the Atlanta-based agency said in its
weekly report.
   ``There have been about 10 scientific papers over the past two
years studying the matter, and almost all have pointed out that the
previous recommendations were inadequate,'' Kane said.
   In one study, 40 percent of obstetricians couldn't name more
than two high-risk groups for hepatitis B, and 72 percent didn't
know the recommended treatment for infants born to infected
mothers, the CDC said.
   In addition, studies in several inner-city hospitals which test
all pregnant women found that only 35 percent to 65 percent of
those infected would fall under the old guidelines.
   Also Thursday, the CDC recommended vaccination of all newborns
in certain small but very-high-risk populations, such as Alaskan
natives and Pacific islanders. In those groups, hepatitis B is
``highly endemic,'' the CDC said.

   Costa Rican President and Nobel laureate
Oscar Arias urged more than 5,550 graduates at a rainy Harvard
University commencement ceremony Thursday to use their education
``to contribute to ease suffering in the world.''
   Arias, who received an honorary degree during the school's 337th
commencement, also pledged to continue to seek peaceful solutions
to turmoil in Central America.
   ``What I am looking for is that the five nations of Central
America will be able to live out their destinies in freedom,
justice, peace and harmony, internally and externally,'' Arias said
in prepared remarks.
   Arias received the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his plan to end
regional conflict in Central America.
   ``The majority of young people in this world are neither here
nor in other university graduations,'' Arias said. ``That majority,
if they are lucky, got up early today to plow fields or to start up
machines in factories. Young people like yourselves are dying in
futile wars or barely subsisting with no hope.
   ``The privilege of knowledge bears a social responsibility. Upon
graduation, every student has an obligation to society. Your
actions of the future must make a difference, must contribute to
ease suffering in the world.''
   More than 25,000 graduates, alumni and guests attended the
outdoor ceremonies. Harvard President Derek Bok conferred degrees
en masse, school by school. Some doctorate recipients held children
aloft and students popped champagne bottles. Business school
graduates were booed roundly when they stood to receive their
degrees.
   In all, the school conferred 5,526 undergraduate and graduate
degrees.
   In presenting an honorary doctor of laws degree, Bok praised
Arias for his ``clear voice of peace and reason for our new world.''
   Other honorary degree recipients were: economist John Kenneth
Galbraith, Christian Science Monitor Editor Katherine Woodruff
Fanning, operatic soprano Jessye Norman, mathematician David Harold
Blackwell, ancient Roman historian Sir Ronald Syme, astrnomer Vera
Cooper Rubin and epidemiologist Sir Richard Doll.

   Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian and
wounded four on Thursday, one of the most violent recent days in
the occupied lands, and Arabs mounted another general strike to
begin the seventh month of their rebellion.
   At least 203 Palestinians have been killed and more than 5,000
injured since the uprising began Dec. 8, and 5,000 Arabs are in
prison. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish settler also have been
slain.
   Stores were closed and public transport halted Thursday in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and in Arab east Jerusalem, but
the army said many Palestinians ignored the general strike.
   A 40-year-old Arab motorist died of a heart attack after his car
was stoned as he passed the Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem,
the army said. Israel radio said camp residents stoned several
Arab-owned cars, apparently to enforce compliance with the strike.
   The radio quoted military officials it did not identify as
saying Thursday was one of the most violent days since the level of
protest began to decline in May.
   In an attempt to quell violence, the army put eight refugee
camps and towns under curfews that confined nearly nearly 10
percent of the 1.5 million Palestinians in occupied territories to
their homes.
   A report by six army doctors on army methods in Gaza accused
soldiers of misusing tear gas by firing it into closed spaces.
   It also said use of high-velocity bullets that can cause
devastating injuries is unjustified in dispersing protests. The
army will not say whether it uses such ammunition.
   At Khezaa village in the southern Gaza Strip, the army razed the
home of a Palestinian accused of trying to firebomb a building
Thursday that houses the local council appointed by Israeli
authorities.
   ``The message of demolishing the house must be clear to
everybody. Anybody who tries to harm these people (appointed Arab
officials) will be caught ... and severely punished,'' the army
commander of the southern Gaza Strip said on Israel radio. He was
identified only as Col. Yitzhkad.
   The unsuccessful attack occurred two days after the attempted
assassination by stabbing of Hassan Tawil, 74, the mayor Israel
appointed for El Bireh in the West Bank. Palestinian underground
leaders have demanded that all municipal officials appointed by
Israel resign.
   Israeli military officials in the West Bank said many students
and Palestinians who work in Israel ignored the strike called by
the United Leadership of the Uprising, which is led by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``School attendance was about 70 percent Thursday, compared to
nearly 100 percent Wednesday,'' said Olivier Rafowicz, a spokesman
for the military government.
   Army radio said masked men entered West Bank schools Thursday
and urged students to leave classes and demonstrate. Palestinian
leaders had asked students to boycott classes.
   Spot checks showed several schools closed, including some in
east Jerusalem and Ramallah.
   Rafowicz said most of the 45,000 West Bank Arabs working in
Israel reported to their jobs. He had no figures for Gaza.
   Arab doctors said soldiers killed Ahmed Hassan Hawari, 17, with
a bullet in the head in Sebastiya village near Nablus. The army
said Hawari was standing on a terrace and an officer shot him when
the youth raised a large rock, apparently to throw at soldiers.
   Dozens of protesters attacked soldiers with bottles and stones
in the Nablus market and the troops opened fire, wounding two, the
army reported.
   Hospital officials said soldiers shot an 18-year-old Palestinian
and a 12-year-old girl in the legs at Tulkarem. The army confirmed
one wounded.
   The team of Israeli doctors organized by Dedi Zucker, a
left-wing member of Parliament, said high-velocity bullets disperse
in the body and shatter bones.
   ``They work on the principle of the dumdum, so it is much more
damaging. The bone fragments virtually act as bullets in the
body,'' said Dr. Ruhama Marton. Her reference was to soft-nosed
bullets first made at the Dumdum Arsenal near Calcutta, India.
   According to the report, such bullets produced two
quadriplegics, 13 paraplegics and 20 cases of serious internal
injuries.
   The doctors accused soldiers of misusing tear gas by firing into
closed spaces but said they could not determine whether tear gas
had caused miscarriages.
   Bill Lee of the U.N. relief agency said last week that tear gas
fired into confined spaces, had killed 11 Palestinians and caused
dozens of miscarriages.

   Colossus will get his first glimpse of
another gorilla in more than 20 years when his gorilla girlfriend
arrives next week from St. Louis on a breeding loan, a zoo official
said Thursday.
   Colossus, billed as the largest lowland gorilla in captivity at
6-foot-2 and more than 550 pounds, hasn't seen another member of
his species since infancy, when he was captured in West Africa.
   Colossus and his soon-to-be girlfriend, Muke, are both 22, prime
breeding age for such apes, said Pat Quinn, director of The Zoo,
which is near this Pensacola suburb in western Florida.
   Muke, pronounced Moo-key, arrives Wednesday.
   ``Have I got a girl for him,'' Quinn joked.
   To prepare Colossus for his blind date, scientists from the
University of West Florida have been showing him videotapes of
gorillas.
   ``He did respond,'' Quinn said. ``He was most interested in
gorillas that interacted with humans because that's what he is used
to.''
   Colossus has been the star attraction at The Zoo since he took
his first step into the outdoors at a gorilla compound March 18. He
came to the zoo from Benson's Animal Park in Hudson, N.H., where he
had been kept in a small indoor cage since his capture.
   An effort in New Hampshire to produce offspring from Colossus
through artificial insemination failed because the huge ape wasn't
very sexually active. Quinn said Colossus has recently shown signs
of more sexual interest.
   Gorillas are an endangered species and Colossus is seen as
particularly attractive for breeding because he was captured in the
wild and will introduce a new gene pool into the community of
captive apes.

   The government on Thursday refused to grant an
autonomous homeland to Tatars forcibly deported from their Crimean
homeland during World War II. A member of the ethnic group said it
would protest the decision.
   A government commission said in a report ``there are no grounds
for establishing'' autonomy for Tatars, Turkic-speaking descendants
of the Mongols.
   ``Now we don't have any faith in the government,'' Zeni Ametov,
a 35-year-old Tatar, said in a telephone interview from his Moscow
home.
   Ametov said he was ``now in a state of shock'' and said Crimean
Tatars tentatively are planning June 20 demonstrations in Moscow
and other cities to protest the decision.
   The government announcement was a major setback for the ethnic
group, whose members have been agitating for a return from what
they consider exile in Central Asia to their ancestral lands on the
Black Sea.
   A government commission headed by President Andrei A. Gromyko
was formed to study Tatar grievances after activists staged an
extraordinary 21-hour demonstration in Red Square last summer.
   The commission's report, carried by the official Tass news
agency, criticized groups of Crimean Tatars for ``insisting that
the issue of creating a Crimean autonomy be resolved first.''
   It said there has been greater employment and educational
opportunities in the past year.
   The issue of disgruntled ethnic minorities has been a sensitive
one for Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has acknowledged
that appeasing the country's more than 100 national groups is among
the Soviet Union's most pressing problems.
   The Crimean Tatars, as well as ethnic Armenians, have taken
advantage of greater tolerance under Gorbachev to stage public
demonstrations.
   The Tatars were deported from their Crimean homes after Josef
Stalin accused them of collaborating with the Nazis during World
War II.
   Tatar activists say about 110,000 people, or 46 percent of their
population, died during or soon after the deportation. The rest
were resettled in the Ural Mountains, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
   The Tatars, who today number about 300,000, were rehabilitated
in 1967 but still not permitted to return en masse to the Crimean
Peninsula.
   The government statement noted that the Soviet Union has eased
restrictions that barred some Tatars from returning to the Crimea.
   ``Since the middle of 1987, about 2,500 Crimean Tatars have been
granted resident permits and fixed up with jobs in the Crimea,''
the statement said.
   In addition, ``extra conditions have been created to develop
their national culture and opportunities broadened to study their
native language.''
   But Ametov said Crimean Tatars who have moved back to their
homeland have done so solely on their own initiative after lengthy
battles with authorities.
   ``There are some improvements, but that is only through the
efforts of individuals,'' Ametov said.

<HEAD>Senior Says Remarks Were Misinterpreted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school senior says he told classmates
their graduation would be memorable, but he just intended a
practical joke, not the violence feared by administrators who
canceled final exams and graduation exercises.
   Neal Loeslein, 18, who witnessed a friend's suicide, denied that
some students at Fairview High School, troubled by the death, had
made a suicide pact.
   ``There wasn't one. That was just a rumor,'' he told The
Pittsburgh Press in a story published Thursday.
   Officials in Fairview, an affluent, suburban Erie County
district, decided earlier this week to cancel Wednesday's finals,
Thursday's baccalaureate service and Sunday's graduation for about
150 seniors because they felt they could not guarantee the safety
of students and guests.
   An administrator who spoke to Erie County newspapers on
condition he not be identified said psychologists believed the
threat of violence during graduation was real and they advised the
board to cancel all events that would give the troubled students a
forum to carry out their threats.
   Loeslein told the Press he was the student present at
Christmastime at the home of another senior who fatally shot
himself in the head with a .44-caliber Magnum. He said talk of a
suicide pact surfaced soon afterward and that the talk apparently
intensified two weeks ago when he told classmates in a general way,
``This is a graduation we will all remember.''
   Loeslein said he had planned to play a practical joke at the
ceremony but had not decided what it would be. He said his remarks
were misconstrued by classmates and officials.
   An attempt by The Associated Press to reach Loeslein by
telephone Thursday was unsuccessful because the family has an
unlisted number.
   Requests for comment on Loeslein's remarks were referred to the
school board solicitor, Frank Kroto, who did not return phone
messages Thursday.
   After the suicide, school officials called in experts from the
University of Pittsburgh's Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
to talk to students. Loeslein said his own counselor told school
officials he was doing well, but the Pittsburgh counselors warned
he was still troubled.
   Loeslein told the Press he has had trouble with school officials
for repeated rule violations. His mother, Shirley Loeslein, said
some teachers and students have an unfair opinion of her son.
   ``After (the student died), the paranoia set in,'' she said.
``They were afraid that he (Loeslein) might explode or something.''
   School administrators who spoke to The Erie Daily Times and The
Erie Morning News said the Pittsburgh counselors diagnosed at least
two unidentified students as suicidal and possibly homicidal.
   ``We went from trying to protect several students from
themselves to trying to protect the entire class and their parents
from these disturbed kids,'' one high-ranking administrator said.
   Kroto said several officials had received death threats, but he
would not be more specific.
   State police Capt. Douglas L. Greenfield in nearby Girard said
police were not asked for assistance until Wednesday, and a
spokesman said Thursday no complaint about any death threats had
been filed.
   State police said the homes of threatened administrators were
the object of increased routine patrols, and school board President
Barbara Junker said the administrators have been offered whatever
private protection they believe appropriate.
   Loeslein and other students said they know of at least one
administrator, in charge of discipline, who was the object of
written and verbal statements that could be misconstrued as threats.
   ``I think they are totally overreacting,'' Loeslein said.
   Senior class officers donated their $800 class fund, much of it
intended for flowers and other graduation costs, to create a
special suicide prevention fund to be administered by the school's
guidance department.
   ``The officers thought this was the best way to do something
positive,'' class President Gary Guzzardo said.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Completes Hearings On Judge Hastings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee completed public hearings
Thursday in the impeachment proceedings for U.S. District Judge
Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, with a woman contradicting the
testimony of Dade County Mayor Steve Clark.
   Florreyn Joyette Royals, a staff member of the Metro Miami
Action Plan, a civil rights organization, said Hastings did not
talk to Clark after a breakfast social meeting on Sept.6, 1985, as
the mayor had testified before the House Judiciary subcommittee on
criminal justice.
   Clark told the subcommittee on May 26 that after Hastings had
made a speech at the breakfast, the judge stepped off the stage,
shook the mayor's hand and told him to stay away from Kevin
``Waxy'' Gordon, against whom Hastings had approved an FBI wiretap.
   FBI agents testified last week that Hastings had compromised the
wiretap and caused them to close down three major corrpution
investigtions in the Miami area.
   Miss Royals told the subcommittee that she was assigned to
escort Hastings to the meeting and back to his car after he had
spoken. She said Hastings had told her he needed to be in court by
10:30 a.m. and for her to see to it that he finished his speech and
was on his way by 10:15 a.m.
   ``I started tugging at his coat at 10:15 a.m.,'' said Miss
Royals, who said she was stooping behind the judge as he made his
speech to the organization. ``After his speech, he left. He went
back through the catering area and went and got his car. The only
person he talked to was our executive director (Lanny Sumptner) who
he shook hands with as he went out the front door of the hotel.
   ``If he had shaken hands with Mayor Clark he would have had to
jump over the podium and would have dragged me with him, because I
was tugging on his coattails,'' said Miss Royals.
   Miss Royals and the Rev. Bryan O. Walsh, a Catholic priest in
the Miami diocese, testified on behalf of Hastings as the judge's
only witnesses before the subcommittee closed its public hearings.
Walsh said he talked briefly with Hastings and Clark together prior
to the breakfast meeting.
   Hastings declined to testify before the subcommittee.
   He said he believed the subcommittee would exonerate him of the
charges but that he is ``personally relieved and prepared to go
forward if the articles of impeachment are approved against him.
   ``I am legally correct, morally correct and spiritually
satisfied,'' said Hastings after the hearing.
   Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., said he would leave the record
open until next Friday so that the defense could submit any
documents or statements it wished to make.
   Conyers declined to say when the subcommittee would make a
recommendation to the House Judiciary Committee on whether Hastings
should be impeached. If Hastings is impeached by the House, the
Senate will conduct a trial to determine whether he should be
removed from office.
   In addition to the charge that he compromised the three
investigations by leaking the fact that the FBI had a wiretap,
Hastings also is accused of conspiring with Washington lawyer
William Borders to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying the
sentences of two convicted racketeers.
   Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe for
Hastings, was sentenced to five years in prison and was fined
$35,000. In a separate trial, Hastings was acquitted of the bribery
conspiracy charges.

<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis, the wife of likely Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, went home from the hospital
Thursday to further recover from delicate spinal surgery.
   Her husband made sure the ride home was comfortable, positioning
a pillow behind his wife's neck as they drove away from
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston toward their home in
suburban Brookline.
   She made several jokes about her inability to turn her head
because of a neck brace she must wear for several weeks.
   ``The one promise that my doctors have made is that the night
Michael accepts the nomination I can take this collar off,'' Mrs.
Dukakis said. That will come at the Democratic National Convention
in mid-July.
   Asked when she would resume campaigning for her husband, Mrs.
Dukakis smiled and said:
   ``The doctors and nurses are right here and my husband is to my
right so I have to tell you that I promised them that I will not
get back on the campaign trail until the convention.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, 51, began experiencing pain and numbness several
weeks ago, and a preliminary diagnosis indicated two herniated
discs in her neck. She underwent surgery six days ago.
   Two bone fragments were taken from Mrs. Dukakis' hip and fused
to the ruptured discs. Because of that procedure, Mrs. Dukakis is
expected to walk with a limp for several weeks.

<TEXT>
   Announcement of the first program to
distribute hypodermic needles to drug users has sparked a debate
between those who say the plan will curb the spread of AIDS and
those who say it will encourage drug use.
   ``It's like trying to put out a fire with gasoline,'' said Lon
Mabon, executive director of the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a
conservative political group opposed to the project.
   Outside-In, a Portland social service agency, will use a $67,000
grant from the American Foundation for AIDS Research to conduct the
nation's first test to determine if exchanging used needles for
new, sanitary ones will curb the spread of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Sharing needles has been one of the main ways
for transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.
   To qualify for the program, a person will have to admit
intravenous drug use, show identifiable injection marks and have a
needle to exchange for a new one. Participants, who can remain
anonymous, will receive periodic blood tests and counseling.
   ``In a way it's a hook to get drug users reconnected to the
helping system, while seeing if it doesn't decrease the spread of
the HIV virus,'' said Bradley J. Woodworth, president of
Outside-In's board of directors.
   But Mabon criticized it as sending a wrong message. ``It seems
very contradictory on one side of our government and society to say
drugs are wrong ... and then to be handling out needles,'' he said.
   Mayor Bud Clark said the needle exchange is ``worrisome'' and
might be interpreted as encouraging drug use at a time when the
city is making great efforts to eradicate drugs. He called for
researchers to make public results of the program as soon as
possible.
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt also has some reservations about the
program, said press aide Gregg Kantor. ``Any time you appear to
make these drugs easier to take, it worries him,'' Kantor said.
   That doesn't necessarily mean the governor opposes the idea,
Kantor said.
   ``We'll have to wait and see what the results show, and whether
it makes sense or not,'' Kantor said. ``It may, in fact, help
reduce the spread of AIDS.''
   Rosanna Creighton, executive director of Citizens for a Drug
Free Oregon, a group that lobbies for anti-drug laws, questioned
whether drug addicts would participate in the program.
   ``If you look at the history of their lifestyle and behavior
patterns, it doesn't look like a strong possibility,'' she said.
   Woodworth said a similar program in Scotland showed drug users
were willing to travel up to two miles to get clean needles.
   ``There may be some who are totally unsalvageable. We're trying
to find out if there's a percentage of people whose behavior can be
modified.
   Dr. Lester Wright, the state's top public health officer, said
he thinks the needle exchange program is worth a try.
   Wright, who is deputy administrator of the state Health
Division, rejected arguments that the program will encourage drug
use.
   ``Drug use is unhealthy, it's stupid and it's illegal, but it is
happening,'' he said. ``I don't see a need to make it any more
fatal than it already is.''
   ``Because of the AIDS problem, I think we have to look at
anything that could reduce its spread and evaluate whether it
works,'' Wright said.
   Several critics expressed fears that the program would hurt
Portland's reputation.
   ``This whole free needle thing is just one more nail in the
coffin as far as our image,'' said mayoral candidate Ron Still, a
former police chief.
   Legal opposition has been holding up a similar program in New
York City. In Massachusetts, state lawmakers on Wednesday debated a
needle distribution program in Boston.
   Woodworth said Portland's comparatively low AIDS infection rate
among drug users, 5 percent compared to 60 percent in New York,
makes the city an ideal location for the project.
   ``This is a city where it's not too late to see if it makes a
difference,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee approved
legislation Thursday to make it more difficult for drug dealers and
other criminals to hide their profits.
   The bill would require banks to file transaction reports for all
cashiers' checks, money orders and travelers' checks of $3,000 or
more. Now, banks need to file such reports on transactions of
$10,000 or more.
   The measure would also authorize law enforcement agencies to
inspect the records of bank insiders suspected of being involved in
criminal activity against the bank without the targeted people
being tipped off. The Financial Privacy Act now requires such
persons to be told when agencies are looking at their record.
   The legislation would also authorize the treasury secretary to
target an individual institution in a geographical area for
additional recordkeeping where drug activity is heavy and large
cash sums are being generated.

   A pair of wild pigs that wandered off
course got hit by an F-16 fighter, forcing the pilot to eject as
the jet veered off a runway and crashed at Jacksonville
International Airport.
   The pigs were killed. The pilot was bruised. The $16 million jet
was destroyed.
   Lt. Col. Sam Carter was rolling down the runway at 160 mph after
landing when saw ``a brown blur'' and felt a bump before his Air
National Guard jet veered toward a ditch and a stand of pines late
Tuesday night.
   Carter, who has flown jets for more than 24 years, including
sorties over Vietnam, ejected before the aircraft plowed into the
woods. The remains of a pair of wild pigs were found scattered on
the runway.
   ``It's a very inglorious way for a $16 million aircraft to come
to an end,'' said Carter, bruised but otherwise uninjured. It was
the first time he had ever bailed out of an aircraft.
   Carter, whose career includes 9{ years in the Air Force and 15
years with the Air National Guard, said Wednesday that he has heard
his fill of oinker jokes, including his wife's offer to let him pig
out at a pork dinner.
   Air Force investigators were at the scene Thursday.
   Airport officials said they planned to check for breaks in the
airport fence which is designed to keep animals off runways. Wild
pigs are common in Florida.
   Carter, 46, of Orange Park, had completed a training mission
over the Atlantic Ocean and returned to the airport.
   Col. Don Garrett, commanding officer of the Florida Air National
Guard's 125th Fighter Interceptor Group, said the pigs must have
been struck by the plane's left landing gear, causing the aircraft
to veer sharply and leave the runway.
   The gear broke off, probably after the plane ripped through a
ditch before crashing into the pine trees, he said.
   ``He (Carter) made a quick and timely decision to eject. You
never know when you're leaving a prepared surface, if the plane
could turn upside down. When it started heading for the trees, he
decided to eject,'' Garrett said.
   The rocket-powered ejection seat carried Carter 200 feet into
the air, barely high enough for his chute to open. Carter said the
parachute blossomed just before his feet hit the ground.
   He landed about 100 yards from where the aircraft came to rest
in the splintered pines.
   ``You don't expect that sort of thing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal herbicide expert said Thursday he
was forced out of his job for refusing to recommend use of a
plant-killing substance against cocaine-producing plants in South
America.
   Walter Gentner, 66, former national technical adviser on
narcotics, said he decided to take early retirement rather accept a
demotion from his Agriculture Department post.
   At issue is a preliminary plan by the government to use
Tebuthiuron, known informally as ``spike,'' to eradicate coca
plants in Peru and other Andean countries.
   Eli Lilly & Co., the Indianapolis-based manufacturer of the
herbicide, decided late last month not to sell the product to the
U.S. government for use against coca plants.
   This prompted an angry reaction last week from the State
Department, which said the ``safety and effectiveness of spike has
been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company.'' It said
numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance
with federal regulations.
   On Thursday, State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
appeared to back away from the earlier department statement by
asserting that the herbicide is still being tested by the U.S. and
Peruvian governments.
   Rep. Glen English, D-Okla., had expressed outrage over Lilly's
decision last week, calling the company a ``deserter'' in the war
on drugs. But an aide to English said Thursday that the
congressman, after conferring with Lilly officials, agreed that
there were environmental concerns ``that need to be met.''
   Gentner, who first told his story to National Public Radio and
spoke Thursday in a telephone interview from his Maryland home,
said his experience was a reflection of the ``tremendous pressure
to do something about drugs.''
   ``But we need the facts before we go and do something
irreversible,'' said Gentner, whose 39-year career with the
Agriculture Department ended several weeks ago.
   He said spike is manufactured in pellet form and is ideal for
use along railroads and highways. But he said the herbicide may not
be safe if it is applied to wet soils which are later drenched by
heavy rains. In that case, the pellets could roll downhill and
affect plants outside the target area, he said, adding that
coca-producing areas in the Andes often have an inch of rain a day.
   Expressing sympathy for Lilly's position, Gentner said a
coca-eradication campaign in South America would represent only a
small part of Lilly's overall operation.
   But if the herbicide proved to be ecologically damaging, Lilly
could be faced with a wave of liability suits and give the product
a ``black mark,'' affecting its marketability in the United States
and elsewhere.
   The Washington Times reported in Wednesday's editions that an
EPA report concluded that the toxic effect of spike and two other
products under consideration in the anti-drug war have not been
fully evaluated.
   Gentner's boss, Thomas Army, deputy administrator of the
Agricultural Research Service, did not immediately a call Thursday
seeking comment on Gentner's allegations. But Army told The
Washington Times that Gentner wasn't aggressive enough.
   ``You got to get after it with a sense of urgency,'' Army said.
   Mrs. Oakley said the herbicide is widely used in the United
States and Brazil and that Lilly stands by the safety of its
product.
   But a Lilly spokesman, Ted McKinney, said Thursday the herbicide
is safe only ``when used according to labeled directions for
approved purposes.''
   ``Lilly has not tested Tebuthiuron for use in controlling coca
nor has the company tested Tebuthiuron under the actual conditions
found in Peru,'' he said.

   Somali troops executed dozens of men and

foreign aid workers said Thursday.
   The workers, who were airlifted from the northern Somali town of

accurate count of the number killed or wounded in fighting that
began with a moonlit rebel attack May 31. They also could not say
how many were civilians, soldiers or rebels.
   However, the accounts depicted bloodier hostilities than have
been admitted so far by the pro-Western government of Maj. Gen.
Mohammed Siad Barre.
   Jean Metenier, 28, a French technician working for the German
Emergency Doctors Humanitarian Organization, said he saw dozens of
bodies around Hargeisa, Somalia's second largest town, including
almost two dozen corpses of young men in civilian garb found behind
his house.
   ``The soldiers would make summary trials, and then execute
them,'' said Metenier, whose house was next to that of Gen. Mohamed
``Morgan'' Siyad, Somalia's northern army commander and Barre's
brother-in-law. ``They were all in civilian clothes and all young
men.''
   Metenier said he did not witness the executions, but heard the
gunfire and counted 21 bodies between May 31 and June 2.
   He said troops driving bulldozers scooped up five of the bodies
behind his house one day and dumped them on a street corner a block
away.
   Mentenier also said about 1,000 wounded were admitted to the
Hargeisa hospital in the first five days of clashes.
   ``Probably most of them were soldiers,'' Metenier said of the
wounded. ``I think in town, a lot of people have been injured,
mostly civilians.''
   Six evacuees seated with Metenier at Nairobi's Norfolk Hotel
corroborated his accounts of fighting, atrocities and the
destruction of homes of suspected rebel sympathizers, but they
would not speak individually to reporters.
   An American aid worker, Ron Wieland of Dazey, North Dakota, said
a shell went through the window of his house when government troops
chased rebel forces up a dry river bed running alongside his
compound. Wieland, 36, said no one in his house was injured but
that ``the situation warranted evacuation.''
   Metenier said the fighting was fiercest in the town center and
on Gennet, one of the nearby hills. ``The government was shelling
daily with tanks, bazookas and MiG-19 aircraft,'' he said.
   He said about 5,000 people lived on the slopes of the hill, the
site of the state National Refugee Commission compound.
   Food stores, other supplies, trucks and equipment were kept in
the compound where the commission coordinated the distribution of
relief aid to 350,000 Ethiopian refugees in 15 northern Somali
camps including Hargeisa, he said.
   He said that even if emergency stocks and transportation had not
been destroyed in the government bombardment of the hill, the
fighting had closed off the road to the camps, cutting off the
refugees' lifeline.
   Metenier also said rebels had taken control of a small power
plant about 12 miles outside Hargeisa which operated the water
pump. He said Hargeisa had been without water since the first few
days of the rebel attack.
   The rebels intensified their offensive in May, one month after
an agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia in which the Horn of
Africa nations agreed to cease support and sanctuary to insurgents
fighting each other's government.
   The rebels of the Somali National Movement, which took up arms
against the government in 1981, claim to control Barao, a town of
50,000 people 110 miles east of Hargeisa, the Hargeisa airport and
three nearby garrison towns.
   Siad Barre seized power in a 1969 military coup. The United
States is Somalia's staunchest ally.
   The evacuees who spoke were among 165 foreign aid and relief
workers airlifted from Hargeisa last Friday and Saturday in a
U.N.-coordinated airlift that angered the government.

   An Army laboratory in Hawaii has positively
identified four sets of remains as Air Force fliers missing from
the Vietnam war, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The four, three of whom died in a 1966 plane crash, were
identified by the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in
Honolulu and were transported to California on Thursday after a
full military honors ceremony at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci participated in the honors
ceremony shortly after his arrival at Hickam from visits in South
Korea and Japan following the Moscow summit.
   Carlucci, Adm. Ronald Hays, commander of U.S. Pacific forces,
and other military leaders stood on a reviewing stand as the four
flag-draped transfer containers were carried past an honor guard
and color guard to a C-141 transport plane.
   Carlucci made no remarks during the 25-minute ceremony.
   The four were among a group of 17 remains repatriated by Vietnam
to the United States on March 2, the Pentagon said in a statement.
The Army lab is still attempting to identify the others from that
group.
   Also awaiting identificaiton are 27 sets of rmeains that were
repatriated on April 6.
   The Pentagon identified the men as:

<TEXT>
   _Air Force Lt. Col. Vincent A. Chiarello, who was born on Aug.
30, 1939, and listed his home of record as New York City.
   _Air Force Lt. Col. Bernard Conklin, who was born on Feb. 27,
1932, and listed his home of record as Stony Point, N.Y.
   _Air Force Chief Master Sgt. James S. Hall, who was born on Oct.
5, 1935, and listed his home of record as Greensboro, N.C.
   Chiarello, Conklin and Hall were three of eight men aboard an
RC-47 reconnaissance plane when it was reportedly attacked by a MiG
jet fighter. According to Pentagon records, the plane went down
over Son La-Hoa Binh Province after a radio distress call.
   _Air Force Lt. Col. Robert R. Gregory, lost over North Vietnam
on Dec. 2, 1966. Gregory was born on March 22, 1932, and listed his
home of record as Cape Girardeau, Mo.
   According to the Pentagon, Gregory was the pilot of an RF-4C
reconnaissance jet that was shot down over North Vietnam. His
navigator survived the crash and spent more than six years as a
prisoner-of-war.
   With the latest identifications, 2,400 Americans remain listed
as missing in Indochina as a result of the Vietnam war, of whom
1,762 are listed as missing in either North or South Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 156 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States and subsequently identified by the laboratory
since the end of the war.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the cooperation of the
Socialist Republic of Vietnam that resulted in the recovery and
return of these remains and hopes it is representative of continued
cooperation to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue,'' the
Pentagon said in its statement.

   President Reagan said Thursday that America's
problem with drug use in the workplace stems in part from students
of the 1960s and 1970s who experimented with illegal substances and
retained their ``destructive drug habits.''
   ``In many ways, our country is still paying for the erosion of
our values and the decline in self-responsibility that occurred in
the 1960s and the 1970s,'' Reagan said in a speech to corporate
leaders trying to drive drugs from the work site.
   ``The students of that period who used illegal drugs in high
school or college have, in many cases, taken their destructive drug
habits with them into their places of employment,'' Reagan said.
   Drug users at the workplace, Reagan said, ``pose a threat to
their co-workers and represent a corporate crisis and a national
catastrophe.''
   First lady Nancy Reagan, in a separate speech, indicated that
she agreed.
   ``For years, young people were the biggest advocates of drug
use. Today young people are much more aware of the dangers,'' Mrs.
Reagan said in a speech to the World Gas Conference.
   ``Today, the real advocates of drug use are the aging holdovers
from the 1960s and 1970s,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   The president said that what was once defended as a victimless
crime ``is costing America billions of dollars a year in lost
productivity.''
   In his speech to the National Conference on a Drug-Free
Workplace, Reagan did not advance any new steps to combat drug
abuse.
   The Cabinet-level National Drug Policy Board is deliberating
proposals to take away student loans and deny drivers' licenses for
anyone convicted of using drugs and impose federal penalties for
drug dealing near public housing projects.
   But sources say the panel is split, and that Education Secretary
William J. Bennett is trying to steer the administration away from
adopting such harsh proposals.
   Reagan did not mention the panel's proposals.
   The president said there are ``limits on what can be
accomplished'' in fighting the supply of drugs, so the battle
against drugs must be directed against the user.
   ``Because so long as there is a demand for illegal drugs, there
will be a powerful financial incentive for drug traffickers to
satisfy that demand,'' Reagan said.
   The president said he believed there has been ``a major change
of attitude in America'' about drug use and that ``the momentum has
shifted from those who celebrated the drug subculture to those who
just say no and help others do the same.''
   ``It is this change in attitudes that I believe makes total
victory in the war on drugs not just possible but ultimately
certain,'' Reagan said.
   The National Drug Policy Board also is considering whether to
endorse withholding federal aid from state and local governments,
colleges and universities and other publicly financed institutions
if they don't adopt the anti-drug proposals, which are still in the
discussion stage.
   Under current law, educational institutions receiving federal
aid are required to certify that they have drug abuse prevention
programs.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III chairs the policy board, but
Bennett is trying to steer the Reagan administration away from some
of the proposals, according to administration sources speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Bennett, who favors increased use of the military as an
anti-drug measure, has expressed doubts that the current proposals
would be effective, the sources have said.
   A spokesman for the Department of Education, Loye Miller,
declined to comment on Bennett's views.
   Policy board members are discussing having student loan
recipients sign a document stating that being a convicted drug user
can mean loss of the loan.
   They also are discussing making it a federal crime to sell drugs
near public housing, similar to the federal schoolyard law making
it a federal crime to sell drugs in the vicinity of schools.
   Another proposal under discussion at the policy board calls for
state governments to refuse to issue first-time drivers' licenses
to minors who have been convicted of drug use. The federal
government would enforce this by threatening to withhold federal
transportation funds.

<TEXT>
   The best-dressed students at two public elementary
schools could be in blue-and-white uniforms this fall as principals
try to stifle fashion rivalry and tighten discipline.
   The Dade County School Board adopted the voluntary program
Wednesday for the Martin Luther King and Charles R. Drew elementary
schools in Liberty City.
   A study by the school principals found overwhelming acceptance
of the uniforms, and school officials anticipate a high rate of
cooperation.
   Drew and King are the first public schools in Dade to adopt
uniforms, but the practice has taken hold elsewhere. In Baltimore,
where four public schools adopted uniforms last year, the outfits
were so successful in raising self-esteem, ending fashion wars and
improving discipline that 35 more schools will follow suit this
fall.
   The uniforms at Drew and King will be jumpers or skirts and
blouses for girls and trousers, shirts and ties for boys. Uniforms
for low-income students will be donated by private companies.
   ``When they wake up in the morning, when they look in that
closet, they are going to know what they're going to wear and
they're going to come to school focusing on the basic skills,''
said Fred Morley, principal at Drew.

   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York and more than a
dozen other clergy celebrated Mass on Thursday at Moscow's only
Roman Catholic Church, the cardinal's secretary said.
   Monsignor James McCarthy said O'Connor, four other cardinals and
10 priests visiting Moscow for the celebration of the 1,000th
anniversary of Chrisitianity in this land, said Mass for about 70
people at downtown Moscow's St. Louis Church.
   O'Connor, who arrived with a Vatican delegation Wednesday, also
traveled to Zagorsk, a city about 35 miles northeast of the Soviet
capital for the closing session of a four-day Russian Orthodox
Church council dedicated to the millennium, McCarthy said.
   While in Zagorsk, the site of a medieval monastery that now
houses a seminary, the 68-year-old O'Connor met church officials of
various faiths including Metropolitan Filaret of Minsk, head of
external affairs for the Russian Orthodox Church, and Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie, the cardinal's secretary said.
   The Roman Catholic delegation to the millennium was honored at a
dinner given by Russian Orthodox church leaders Thursday evening.
   ``It was a very open, warm and cordial dinner with an honest
exchange'' between the two delegations, McCarthy said.
   Celebrations of the anniversary of Christianity continue in
Moscow through Sunday and then move to Leningrad, Kiev and Vladimir.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way For Morison Imprisonment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way
for the imprisonment of former U.S. intelligence analyst Samuel
Loring Morison, convicted of espionage and theft.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, denied Morison's emergency request to
remain free pending a formal appeal of his conviction.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had turned down Morison's
request on June 2 and Morison's lawyers then turned to Justice
William J. Brennan for help.
   After Brennan referred the request to the full court, a federal
trial judge in Baltimore ruled that Morison could remain free until
June 15 while the full court considered his bid to stay out of
prison.
   Presumably, U.S. District Judge Joseph Young's order now will be
set aside and Morison will have to begin serving a two-year term.
   The Supreme Court order issued Thursday was one sentence. It
said, ``The application for continued release from detention
presented to Justice Brennan and by him referred to the court is
denied.''
   Justices Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun
dissented. They voted to let Morison remain free until the court
acts on his formal appeal.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction in
April, rejecting Morison's arguments that Congress intended laws
against spying to protect against the distribution of classified
material to a foreign government rather than leaks to the press.
   Morison, grandson of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning naval
historian Samuel Eliot Morison, was convicted in October 1985 of
giving to Jane's Defence Weekly photographs taken by a U.S. spy
satellite of a Soviet nuclear aircraft carrier under construction.
   Morison, who worked as a civilian for the Navy, also was
convicted of the theft of the photos and government documents
describing a May 1984 explosion at the Soviet Union's Severomorsk
naval base.
   He was sentenced to two years in prison but remained free under
$100,000 bond pending appeal.
   Prosecutors said Morison's actions endangered national security
because the photos revealed how a U.S. spy satellite worked. They
also said he leaked the photos to get a full-time job with Jane's
after doing part-time work for the military journal while employed
by the Navy.
   Defense attorneys contended Morison was trying to educate the
public about a Soviet navalbuildup and that the photos told the
Soviets nothing they had not learned already from a 1978 incident
in which the spy satellite's operations manual was sold to a Soviet
agent.
   The case is Morison vs. U.S., A-876.

   The Senate voted 69-27 Thursday to choke off a
filibuster that has blocked action on a bill permitting the death
penalty for major drug dealers who kill police officers.
   The decision sets up a vote on the bill Friday that supporters
and opponents agreed probably would result in approval.
   ``This sends the message that we're not going to tolerate the
kind of warfare we're seeing on the streets of our cities,'' Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., chief author of the bill, told his
colleagues.
   But opponents such as Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., derided the
measure as an election-year attempt to appease public demands to do
something about illegal drugs. They also noted the death penalty
already exists in many states and it hasn't deterred drug pushers.
   ``Once again, we're going for an election-year slam dunk on
drugs,'' Evans said, noting that a similar bill was proposed in
1986. ``We're taking precipitous steps to indulge our own political
vanity.''
   Thursday's tally was nine votes more than the 60 needed to
invoke cloture, the parliamentary device used in the Senate to end
a filibuster. Opponents began an effort to talk the measure to
death after D'Amato originally attached it as an amendment to the
defense budget bill.
   But D'Amato dropped his amendment on the defense bill two weeks
ago, leading to Senate approval of that measure, in return for a
promise by Senate Democratic leaders to allow floor action on a
separate death penalty measure.
   Senate approval would send the bill to the House, where it faces
an uncertain future. It would go to the House Judiciary Committee,
which has in the past steadfastly refused to send such a measure to
the floor.
   D'Amato's bill provides that the death penalty can be imposed on
people who are convicted in federal courts of running a drug ring
and who are then separately convicted of killing law enforcement
officers or private citizens. It applies to federal laws, but could
also be followed by individual states.
   Before invoking cloture, the Senate killed, 65-31, a proposed
amendment that would have imposed a penalty of life imprisonment
without parole, instead of the death penalty, for persons convicted
under the terms of D'Amato's bill.
   While the Senate was debating, New York Mayor Edward I. Koch was
calling for the use of military forces to halt drug trafficking and
suggesting that the federal government should open tent jails in
Nevada to help relieve prison overcrowding caused by drug-related
arrests.
   ``We want the Navy with the Air Force on the high seas to
detect, apprehend and arrest drug smugglers,'' Koch told a hearing
by two House Armed Services subcommittees.
   The panels are looking at proposals approved separately by the
House and Senate to increase the military's role in the anti-drug
effort.
   Koch called for repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act, the 1878 law
barring the military from enforcing civilian laws. ``It's
ridiculous. Get rid of it!'' he said.
   He also noted prisons are too crowded now and suggested: ``The
federal government should open up tent jails ... out in Nevada.
Nevada won't like it ....''
   He was willing to split the cost with the U.S. government. ``If
the feds opened up additional jails _ as I hope that they will _
we'll pay one-third,'' Koch said. He endorsed creation of a federal
surtax with the new money to be devoted solely to anti-drug
programs.
   Meantime, President Reagan said the nation's problems with drugs
in the workplace arise partly from students who used illegal
substances in the 1960s and 1970s and who have retained
``destructive drug habits.''
   ``In many ways, our country is still paying for the erosion of
our values and the decline in self-responsibility that occurred in
the 1960s and the 1970s,'' the president said in a speech to
corporate leaders trying to drive drugs from the work site.
   ``The students of that period who used illegal drugs in high
school or college have, in many cases, taken their destructive drug
habits with them into their places of employment,'' Reagan said.
   Earlier Thursday, the House Banking Committee approved
legislation making it more difficult for drug dealers and other
criminals to hide their profits.
   The bill would require banks to file transaction reports for all
cashiers' checks, money orders and travelers' checks of $3,000 or
more. Now, banks need to file such reports on transactions of
$10,000 or more.

<HEAD>FAA Says Increase in Controller Errors at O'Hare Against Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp increase in errors by air traffic
controllers at Chicago's O'Hare Airport comes at a time when such
mistakes nationwide have been declining steadily, Federal Aviation
Administration officials said Thursday.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor directed an agency team to join
an investigation into why the number of controller errors have
increased at O'Hare. The independent National Transportation Safety
Board this week sent a team to look into controller operations at
Chicago because of the soaring number of controller miscues.
   ``We may have a team out there two or three weeks,'' FAA
spokesman John Leyden said of the agency's O'Hare investigation.
   The NTSB investigation was prompted by reports that there have
been 20 controller errors at the O'Hare facilities so far this year
compared with 12 such errors for all of 1987.
   During the first four months of this year operational errors by
controllers throughout the FAA air traffic control system declined
by 12 percent, according to the agency. Leyden said there were 345
such errors from January through April, compared with 393 during
the same four months of 1987.
   An operational error occurs whenever a controller allows two
aircraft under his direction to fly closer than regulations allow.n 18
percent increase in errors
during the first half of 1987, following two years of decline. The
number of errors dropped in the in the second half of 1987,
resulting in the number of errors increasing only slightly for the
full year.
   ``The national trend (in controller errors) is downward,'' said
Leyden.
   But the O'Hare tower and its radar room have repeatedly over the
years been a trouble spot for the FAA. In recent years the O'Hare
facilities have been investigated by FAA teams from Washington, the
NTSB and congressional committees.
   The tower handles planes in and out of O'Hare, which last year
had nearly 789,000 aircraft takeoffs and landings. The radar room
handles aircraft within a 30-mile radius of the airport, including
overflights and approaches and departures to and from Chicago.
   Some 112 controllers work at the two facilities, 27 fewer than
authorized, and only about half of them are classified as being
fully qualified to work at all air traffic positions, according to
the FAA.
   McArtor this week directed that eight additional controllers be
assigned to handle traffic at O'Hare because of the expected
traffic volumes this summer.
   But unusual jumps in controller errors is nothing new at O'Hare.
According to an investigation last year by the House Government
Operations Committee, the number of errors at O'Hare's tower
increased to 23 in 1986 from only 14 the previous year.
   That increase also came at a time when controller miscues
nationwide were declining.

Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The Florida crop, based on June 1 indications, was estimated at
nearly 141 million boxes, unchanged from last month but a 17
percent jump from last season, the report said.
   California production was forecast at 31.8 million boxes, an
increase of 3 percent over May but down 8 percent from the 1986-87
level. The Arizona crop was expected to total 2.3 million boxes, 27
percent below last season.
   The report said that Texas orange production was about 1.43
million boxes, compared with 875,000 boxes harvested last season.

   Low- and moderate-income families would

   The College Savings Bond Act of 1988 was sent to Capitol Hill by
Education Secretary William J. Bennett and Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III.
   For families with adjusted gross incomes under $60,000, interest
earned on the bonds would be tax-exempt if the proceeds were used
to pay for college tuition or related expenses by the bondholder,
spouse, child or dependent.
   The tax benefit would be reduced for families earning between
$60,000 and $80,000, and eliminated entirely for households with
incomes above $80,000.
   The Treasury Department estimated lost federal revenues would
total $11 million in fiscal year 1989 and gradually rise to $284
million by fiscal year 1994. The bonds would be available starting
Jan. 1.
   In a statement, Bennett said college savings bonds would be ``a
safe and convenient higher education investment for millions of
Americans and for their children.''
   An Education Department spokeswoman said the administration bill
would be formally introduced within the next few working days by
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and Rep. John Duncan,
R-Tenn., the senior Republican member of the House Ways and Means
Committee. Some 50 co-sponsors are expected on the House side, said
department spokeswoman Jane Glickman.
   The administration proposal is similar to a more generous bill
introduced last fall by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.; and Robert Stafford, R-Vt.
   Under their plan, no taxes would be due on interest earnings
used for educational purposes if the taxpayer's income was below
$75,000. The tax benefit would decline gradually to zero at the
$150,000 income level.
   Kennedy said at the time it had been estimated that if 1 million
families each bought $500 in bonds and held them for 15 years,
under his bill, the tax revenue lost when the bonds were redeemed
would be $845 million.
   Lawmakers and others have been seeking ways to help families
cope with rising higher education costs, citing a 75 percent hike
since 1980 and a major federal shift from grants to loans in the
student aid area.
   Vice President George Bush, when he launched his campaign for
the GOP presidential nomination last year, said he wanted to be
known as ``the education president'' and suggested the college
savings bonds approach.

<HEAD>Gesell Cancels Iran-Contra Hearing After Complaints About
Subpoenas</HEAD>

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case abruptly
canceled a closed pre-trial hearing Thursday following prosecution
complaints that the defense had improperly subpoenaed CIA, Justice
Department and White House documents.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell also quashed the subpoenas
issued for documents that showed how officials at the three
agencies were briefed and prepared for questioning by the grand
jury that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   Gesell's order came a day after six news organizations filed a
motion to open the proceeding to the public on grounds that the
judge had not sufficiently justified keeping it closed.
   The hearing, which Gesell had scheduled for next Monday, was to
have been held to determine whether government agency lawyers had
used the immunized congressional testimony of three of the
Iran-Contra defendants to prepare officials for questioning by the
grand jury.
   The possible exposure of grand jury witnesses to the immunized
congressional testimony of fired National Security Council aide
Oliver L. North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim is an issue before Gesell.
   The defense contends that the staff of independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh and grand jurors were exposed to admissions the
three defendants made to Congress under limited grants of immunity,
and, therefore, the case must be dismissed.
   Walsh contended in court papers that the defense improperly
served ``oppressive subpoenas ... calling for documents beyond the
scope of the ordered hearing in an effort to obtain internal
governmental materials _ some of them privileged _ which this court
has twice previously ruled that the defendants should not now
have.''
   In April, Gesell took similar action to quash defense subpoenas
for similar material and penalized defense lawyers by barring them
from presenting testimony at an earlier hearing on the immunity
issue.
   During that proceeding, the defense was allowed to cross-examine
Walsh, who testified about procedures he had implemented to prevent
his staff and grand jurors from being exposed to the immunized
testimony. Gesell also quashed subpoenas ordering other members of
Walsh's staff to appear at the hearing.
   This time, Gesell's response was to cancel the hearing. It was
not immediately clear whether he would hold another proceeding
later.
   But Gesell's action appears to make moot a motion by two
television networks and four newspapers to open the hearing to the
public.
   After he originally scheduled the proceeding, Gesell explained
in an order he was closing the hearing because ``it is expected the
testimony may to some extent involved classified materials and to
some degree relate to matters of attorney-client privilege.''
   The news organizations contended that ``the mere fact that
certain material may be classifed is not in itself sufficient to
warrant automatic closure of an entire hearing.''
   ``At most it would justify exclusion of the press and the public
from that portion of the hearing at which classified information
was discussed,'' said the brief filed by CBS, ABC, The New York
Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal and The
Washington Post.

   Federal health officials recommended that all
pregnant women be tested for hepatitis and that newborns of
infected women be vaccinated, to prevent 3,500 babies a year from
becoming potentially doomed hepatitis carriers.
   ``It is now evident that routine screening of all pregnant women

   Each year in the United States, about 16,500 babies are born to

   An experimental birth control vaccine shows
promise for blocking pregnancy for six months without significant
side effects, a preliminary study suggests.
   The vaccine spurred the immune systems of women volunteers into
making proteins, called antibodies, that block the action of a
hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin, which is produced
during pregnancy.
   The vaccine's effectiveness could not be tested directly because
the women had been surgically sterilized. But animal studies had
shown that an antibody attack on the hormone could halt a pregnancy
at an early stage, researchers wrote.
   The study is described in Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan said Thursday that a first lady
must be ``a stone wall'' when it comes to looking after her
husband's health, ``and if that interferes with affairs of state,
then so be it.''
   Mrs. Reagan, in a speech to the World Gas Conference, said ``no
first lady need make apologies for looking out for her husband's
welfare.''
   Although Mrs. Reagan made no reference to former White House
chief of staff Donald T. Regan, her remarks were clearly directed
at the critical portrait he painted of her in his recently
published book, ``For the Record.''
   The book disclosed that Mrs. Reagan consulted an astrologer for
aid in helping prepare her husband's schedule. Regan also portrayed
the first lady as controlling access to the president in the weeks
following his prostate surgery in 1985, and having engineered
Regan's ouster in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Mrs. Reagan has refused to comment directly on the assertions in
Regan's book. During a tour of Leningrad at last week's U.S.-Soviet
summit, reporters had a chance to question her, and she replied,
``Everything has been said about that, that needs to be said.''
   In her speech, Mrs. Reagan made no mention of astrology.
   Her address largely echoed a similar speech she delivered last
spring, when she defended her role as her husband's protector
several weeks after Regan's departure from the White House.
   ``No matter what is written about her, there's one thing on
which any first lady must be a stone wall. The first lady is first
of all a wife,'' she said Thursday.
   Speaking of his hospitalization, she said, ``I believe my
husband has as much right to a normal recuperation as any other
husband. And I think it's an important, legitimate role for a first
lady to look after a president's health and well-being. And if that
intereferes with affairs of state, then so be it.''
   The first lady also likened her life as ``a high-wire existence,
and I wouldn't trade the experience for even extra years added to
my life.''

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bill to Limit Private Employers' Use of
Lie-Detector Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate passed and sent to President Reagan
on Thursday legislation that would limit the use of lie-detector
tests by private employers.
   The legislation, which was approved 68-24, also would prevent
employers from taking adverse actions against employees solely on
the basis of the test results.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
Committee, said the legislation ``will put an end to decades of
injustice.''
   Kennedy said the measure ``carefully balances the interests of
employers and employees, based on the known scientific evidence
regarding lie detectors and their potential for abuse.''
   Judy Goldberg, representing the American Civil Liberties Union,
said the bill ``will protect thousands of workers who are currently
being labeled as liars by these machines that don't work.''
   The House approved the bill last week on a 251-120 vote.
   The Office of Technology Assessment estimated that two million
polygraph tests were administered in 1987, with 90 percent given by
private employers. Most of those tested were job applicants,
although tests also were given to workers under investigation.
   Twenty-two states prohibit the tests in the private sector, and
19 regulate private use of the tests.
   The accuracy of test results has been questioned, and so has the
competency of some examiners.
   The compromise legislation _ which followed passage of separate
polygraph bills by the House and Senate _ would permit private
sector testing of applicants for only two types of jobs.
   Those applying for security guard positions could still be
tested, and so could prospective employees who would have direct
access to the manufacture, storage, distribution, or sale of
controlled substances.
   In addition, an employer could test an employee during an
ongoing investigation involving economic loss or injury to the
company.
   However, the employee must have had access to the property that
is the subject of the investigation. And the employer must have
reasonable suspicion that the worker was involved in the incident.
   Before the test began, the worker would have to have been given
specific information about the incident under investigation.
   Only the federal government would be permitted to administer
tests to those employed by, assigned to, or detailed to the
nation's intelligence agencies and to FBI contract employees.
   To protect the rights of workers, the bill would prohibit an
employee from being discharged, dismissed, disciplined,
discriminated against, or denied employment or promotion solely on
the basis of the test or solely because of his refusal to take the
test. To take action against the worker, an employer would have to
have additional supporting evidence.
   Questions on religious or political beliefs could not be asked.
Questions would have to be submitted to the test subject in writing
before the examination. The examinee could end the test at any time.
   Qualification standards would be set for examiners, who would
need a license granted by the state, if one were required by the
state. The examiner also would have to maintain a $50,000 bond.
   The legislation would take effect six months after it became law.

<HEAD>Alabama Shrimp Processors Caught In `Unfortunate Bureaucratic
Snafu'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Alabama businessmen told Congress on
Thursday they were processing imported shrimp under instructions
from the Commerce Department when their plants were raided in April
by armed Customs Service agents.
   D.J. Ficarino Sr., an owner of Mobile Freezers Inc., and Joseph
E. Ladnier, president of Sea Pearl Seafood Co., said they had been
informed by Commerce officials that they could label imported
shrimp as a U.S. product once they peeled, deveined and repacked
the shrimp.
   ``If I though I was doing something illegal, I would have sure
locked up my doors and done it at night,'' Ficarino said. ``I
certainly wouldn't do it in broad daylight.''
   The Customs Service, however, decided that the two shrimp
processors, as well as a third south Alabama company, Gulf Coast
White Knight, were illegally labeling imported shrimp as a product
of the United States. And on April 13, agents raided the three
plants and seized about 600,000 pounds of shrimp worth several
million dollars.
   The shrimp processors, according to Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.,
were caught up in an ``unfortunate bureaucratic snafu'' that
resulted from differing interpretations by two U.S. government
agencies of the same law.
   That law permits an import to be labeled as a product of the
United States if it undergoes ``substantial transformation''
between the time it is imported and the time it is placed on the
market for sale to consumers.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of the
Commerce Department, had advised shrimp processors that peeling and
deveining of shrimp constiuted a ``substantial transformation.''
The Customs Service disagreed.
   At Thursday's hearing before the House Energy and Commerce
investigations and oversight subcommittee, U.S. Attorney Jefferson
B. Sessions III of Mobile, Ala., said he decided not to prosecute
the three shrimp processors because the advice they received from
the Commerce Department removed the element of criminal intent.
   Sessions said, however, that he agreed with the Customs Service
that peeling and deveining imported shrimp does not constitute a
``substantial transformation'' of the product.
   James W. Brennan, assistant administrator for fisheries at the
Commerce Department, acknowledged his agency had provided
misleading and inaccurate information to the south Alabama
shrimpers.
   But Brennan said that for the past 35 years, shrimp processors
all along the Gulf Coast have been placing ``product of the U.S.''
labels on imported shrimp they have peeled and deveined. And he
said his department received no notification from the Customs
Service prior to the April raids that such a practice now was being
considered illegal.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A securities industry representative offered a
compromise Thursday in an attempt to head off legislation that
would bar securities firms from requiring customers to settle
disputes through industry-sponsored arbitration.
   The finance subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee is reviewing a proposal that would prohibit firms from
forcing customers to waive their right to sue in court as a
condition of opening a brokerage account.
   William J. Fitzpatrick, general counsel of the Securities
Industry Association, said securities firms, like any other
business, have a right to set the terms under which they are
willing to do business.
   That includes the right to demand that customers sign a
so-called mandatory arbitration clause binding them to settle
disputes before an arbitration panel sponsored by a stock exchange
or other market organization, he said.
   Fitzpatrick said if there is a problem with customers
unknowingly signing such agreements, ``the industry would have no
objection'' to offering a separate document disclosing the
arbitration clause and explaining its terms.
   However, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
subcommittee, argued that mandatory arbitration, properly disclosed
or not, is ``inherently unfair and oppressive.''
   ``Investors, like all the rest of our citizens, believe they
have a right to their day in court,'' he said.
   Markey said a survey by the staff of the Securites and Exchange
Commission showed that 95 percent of the nation's top retail
brokerage firms require customers to sign arbitration clauses when
they borrow money from the firm on margin.
   Ninety percent of the firms require the clauses for customers
who trade options and 38 percent require the clauses for cash
accounts. An additional 32 percent intend to begin requiring the
clauses for cash accounts.
   ``No one's holding a gun to a customer's head. What is going on
is a sort of benign neglect and a hurried process where the
customer signs an arbitration clause without really knowing what he
is doing,'' said G. Richard Shell, a professor of legal studies at
the University of Pennsylvania.
   He termed the industry's argument that customers are voluntarily
choosing arbitration when they give up their right to sue ``a kind
of trick.''
   ``The industry is getting something and the customer is getting
nothing because the customer always has the right to arbitrate
regardless of whether they sign the agreement,'' Shell said.
   The legislation being considered by the subcommittee would also
bar people with connections to the industry from serving on
arbitration panels. And it would give arbitrators the power to
compel securities firms to produce documents relevant to the case.
   Boyd Page, an Atlanta arbitration attorney, said firms often
``stonewall'' document requests or produce them only at the last
minute.
   The SEC plans to vote July 7 on whether or not to endorse a ban
on mandatory arbitration clauses. Three of its five members have
said they support such a ban.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
said Thursday the Soviet Union wants to restore diplomatic
relations with Israel but will not do so until the Israelis agree
to an international conference on Middle East peace.
   He spoke to reporters after his first meeting with Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who leads Israel's right-wing Likud bloc
and firmly opposes such a conference.
   Both sides said a consular team will go the the Soviet Union
next month on the first visit by Israeli diplomats since the Soviet
Union broke diplomatic relations during the Arab-Israeli war of
1967. A Soviet consular team now is in Israel.
   Shevardnadze and Shamir said there were no breakthroughs in the
meeting, shich lasted just 10 minutes short of two hours, but
described it as friendly, productive and useful.
   It ``does not signify a new stage in relations, but it was a
useful meeting,'' Shevardnadze said. ``If we are able to convene a
conference, that would make it possible to settle the problem of
our relations with Israel.''
   He and Shamir were here for the special General Assembly session
on disarmament. It was Shamir's first session with a high Soviet
official since he met in 1984 with Andrei Gromyko, then foreign
minister.
   Israel has sought a resumption of relations for years and the
Kremlin has stepped up contacts in hopes of increasing its
influence on Middle East peace negotiations.
   The Soviet foreign minister has met with Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres, who approves of a peace conference and of trading occupied
Arab territory for peace, which Shamir opposes.
   Perez, who leads the center-left Labor Party, and Shamir are
partners and rivals in Israel's tenuous coalition government.
Elections are due in November.
   What role the consular team will play in Moscow is not clear.
Israeli officials indicated the diplomats might issue visas to
Soviet Jews wishing to emigrate, but Shamir told Israel radio he
did not know whether they would be allowed to deal with Jewish
matters.
   Shevardnadze answered ``No'' when asked whether the Israeli team
would issue visas. ``There is a certain frame in that agreement and
the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister and the group
itself are well aware of what that understanding is,'' he said
without elaborating.
   ``Our team was well received in Tel Aviv and normal conditions
were created for their work. We shall try to do likewise for the
Israeli group.''
   Emigration of Soviet Jews is continuing, he said, and ``there
are no obstacles, but some constraints.'' He identified the
constraints as ``military secrets only.''
   Shamir told Israeli reporters later that Shevardnadze said the
situation of Soviet Jews will improve and the special Communist
Party meeting scheduled for June 28 will consider the problems of
Jews.
   Answering a question about an international peace conference,
Shevardnadze said: ``Israel must accept a conference before we can
restore ties. These are inter-related elements. Let us convene a
conference and let us also hold serious discussion on settling our
relations.''
   Shamir said he told Shevardnadze, ``Our relations are not
normal. ... We want an embassy in Moscow and you should have an
embassy in Israel.'' He said Shevardnadze agreed, but said the
solution was a peace conference.
   The Israeli prime minister wants direct talks with Israel's Arab
adversaries. He contends Israel would be outnumbered at an
international conference and pressured to make concessions.
   He told the Israeli reporters it would be difficult for the
Soviet Union to play a constructive role in a Middle East
settlement without having normal relations with Israel.

<TEXT>
   Two House committees on Thursday approved
legislation that would sever virtually all economic ties between
the United States and South Africa to pressure the Pretoria
government to abandon its policy of racial apartheid.
   The measure was approved by the Intelligence and Armed Services
committees, both meeting in closed-door sessions, after amendments
were added that would permit the United States to share
intelligence information about Cuban military activities in
southern Africa and permit military cooperation with South Africa
if the president determines such ties to be in the national
interest, committee aides said.
   The bill, which still must clear two more committees before it
can go to the full House for action, would require U.S.
disinvestment in South Africa within a year and ban most trade
between the two countries.
   As originally written, the bill also would have banned military
and intelligence cooperation. But the two committees added language
creating an exemption for diplomatic activities and intelligence
sharing concerning Cuban activities in Angola, where U.S.-backed
rebels are fighting the Marxist government.
   Committee aides said the exemption was granted in part to avoid
having the sanctions bill become a vehicle for a renewed debate
over U.S. support for the Angolan rebels.
   The Armed Services panel also approved an amendment by Rep. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz., permitting military cooperation if the president
deems it in the national interest.
   Both committees reported the bill out on voice votes.
   The measure still must clear the Ways and Means and Interior
committees before being considered by the full House, where it is
expected to pass. The measure is expected to have a tougher time in
the Senate, however, because it lacks the Republican support which
was crucial to passage of a limited sanctions bill two years ago.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee gave
voice-vote approval Thursday to an $18.05 billion fiscal 1989
spending package for water and energy development programs.
   The bill, totalling $92 million less than President Reagan
requested, is noteworthy because it contains no money for new
construction starts by the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of
Reclamation.
   The no-new-starts posture is identical to the stand taken by the
House last month when it approved its energy and water
appropriations bill for the year starting Oct. 1.
   Hundreds of dams, harbor improvements and irrigation systems
would continue to get money for operation and maintenance and work
would continue on dozens now under construction.
   The Senate and House bills would also apply the no-starts
stricture to the superconducting super collider, the huge
high-energy physics installation that would enable scientists to
delve deeper into the nature of matter.
   Both bills would provide $100 million to continue preliminary
research for the SSC, but they would bar the start of construction
on the multi-billion dollar project in fiscal 1989.

   Ex-mercenary Sam Hall said Thursday he will go to
jail rather than testify in a $24 million civil suit brought by two
journalists who accuse U.S. officials and Nicaraguan rebels of
arms-for-drug deals in Central America.
   Hall has refused to answer some questions during depositions
taken in connection with suit about his relationship with two of
the defendants, retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub and Iran-Contra
figure Robert Owen.
   Hall is to appear for a contempt hearing in U.S. District Court
next Wednesday. The suit is scheduled to go to trial June 27.
   ``There are some embarrassing questions and I've been asked not
to answer them,'' Hall said in a telephone interview from his home
in Redington Shores near Tampa. He refused to say who asked that he
remain silent.
   ``There are some things I can't answer, like who briefed me (in
Nicaragua), like who gave me money, who gave me C-4 (plastic
explosive) instructions,'' he said. ``It would make me guilty of
violating the U.S. Neutrality Act.''
   Hall, brother of U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, was captured
spying on Nicaragua's Sandinista government in 1986. He was freed
in January 1987 because his captors said he showed signs of mental
instability.
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs, Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey,
want to know what Hall was doing for the U.S.-backed Contras and
who guided him.
   The suit, filed long before the Iran-Contra affair became
public, accuses Singlaub, Owen and other defendants of running a
secret right-wing terror network dating back to 1959.
   Also named in the suit are Theodore Shackley, former deputy
director of operations for the CIA; Contra director Adolfo Calero;
Medellin Cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa
Vasquez; Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and Albert Hakim and
others.
   The suit accuses the defendants of funding illegal Contra
activities with drug runs in cooperation with the Medellin Cartel,
and threatening, imprisoning and even killing anyone who threatened
to uncover the ring.
   The suit also accuses them of responsibility for the 1984
bombing of a news conference in Nicaragua in which Avirgan was hurt
and eight people died.
   Hall said Singlaub's attorney, Thomas Spencer, had encouraged
him to testify, but Hall said he would refuse to testify to protect
his former boss.
   He said he also had contact with Owen, now a figure in the
Iran-Contra case, in the course of his work for the Contras.

   Representatives of NASA and the Defense
Department began discussions Thursday to decide which agency will
get the first batches of rocket fuel when the sole supplier of a
key ingredient gets back in business next week in Nevada.
   Kerr-McGee Corp. has announced it will resume manufacture of
ammonium perchlorate Monday at its Henderson plant, which shut down
under public pressure May 12, eight days after an explosion
destroyed a competitor's plant nearby.
   In Nevada, meanwhile, seeking to alleviate concerns about the
dangers of continuing manufacture of the fuel, Gov. Richard Bryan
ordered weekly inspections of the Kerr-McGee plant by the state
Division of Occupational Safety and Health.
   Bryan said he won't try to block resumption of operations but
that he will work with federal officials to minimize the amount of
ammonium perchlorate stored at Kerr-McGee.
   Kerr-McGee and Pacific Engineering & Production Co. were the
only producers of ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in the
space shuttle booster rockets and in such military rocket programs
as the Navy's Trident, the Army's Stinger and the Air Force's
Peacekeeper (MX), Minuteman, Titan 34D and Delta.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration lost the fuel
for two shuttle boosters when the Pacific Engineering & Production
Co. plant was demolished by a series of explosions that also killed
two people. It left the space agency with rocket sets for only four
flights.
   ``The fact that Kerr-McGee is opening Monday does help the
situation,'' said Russ Bardos, director of shuttle propulsion for
NASA. ``The longer the delay in Kerr-McGee opening up, the more
serious the immediate problem in terms of keeing the flow and
processing moving on schedule.''
   Bardos and George Abbey, the No. 2 man in NASA's space shuttle
program, is scheduled to meet again Friday with representatives of
other rocket users to allocate the fuel.
   The ingredients in the fuel mix are different for each
application and the priorities must be decided in advance. Bardos
said it takes 10 days to two weeks to produce the 1.7 million
pounds of fuel used by the shuttles.
   NASA had scheduled nine shuttle flighs next year.
   ``We have lost two batches in the Pacific Engineering explosions
and we cannot recover those two batches in the next few months,''
Bardos said. ``Therefore, there will be an impact on at least two
flights.''
   But he cautioned that does not mean the shuttle can fly only
seven times next year. Four of the first 11 post-Challenger flights
_ two this year _ are dedicated to secret Air Force cargo, giving
the Pentagon an incentive to allocate some of its fuel to those
missions.
   Anita Bridges, a Kerr-McGee spokeswoman, announced Wednesday
that agreement had been reached with the Clark County (Nev.) Fire
Department and state officials over the plant's safety and are
ready to resume production.
   The impasse had threatened to block reopening of the plant
because of fears of another explosion.
   Kerr-McGee hired a team of independent safety experts to inspect
the plant and has ``done everything humanly possible to try to
alleviate the fears and concerns of our operation,'' the
spokeswoman said.

   A U.S. Army UH1H helicopter hit a
power line Thursday and crashed in a field along a heavily traveled
highway, killing its three-man American crew, a military spokesman
said.
   The crash occurred near Hittistetten village in the Kreumbach
district, 50 miles west of Munich, said spokesman Sgt. 1st Class
John D'Amato of the 56th Field Artillery Brigade in Schwaebish
Gmuend, 24 miles east of Stuttgart.
   He said the victims' names were withheld until families were
notified.
   D'Amato said the helicopter was returning from a training
mission to its home base at Goeppingen, 15 miles east of Stuttgart,
when it crashed.
   Bavarian police said a fallen powerline pole closed a stretch of
the highway for a time after the accident, but no one on the ground
was hurt.
   D'Amato said a team of investigators was on its way to determine
the cause of the crash.

<HEAD>Nuns Say Church Response to Their Abortion Statement Is Cause for
Hope</HEAD>

   A decision by Roman Catholic officials not to
expel two nuns who signed an advertisement challenging the church's
anti-abortion stance may mark the end of the use of dismissal to
quiet dissent, one of the nuns said Thursday.
   ``I would like to hope that it's the beginning of a process for
our community ... and others to begin to look at the question and
to look at the question of choice for women,'' Sister Patricia
Hussey told a news conference. ``It's about our right to dissent
and our right to dissent publicly on the issue of choice.''
   ``I think also that dismissal would never again be used as an
instrument to quiet dissent,'' she said. ``It is not helpful. It is
not lifegiving, and in fact it's very draining and not for the good
of our congregation and not good for the church.''
   Hussey and Barbara Ferraro, members of the General Government
Group of the Sisters of Notre Dame deNamur, were under threat of
expulsion from the order after they refused to recant opinions in
an Oct. 7, 1984, advertisement in The New York Times which bore
their signatures.
   The full page advertisement, which noted the church's position
that abortion is never permissible, said ``there is a mistaken
belief in American society that this is the only legitimate
Catholic position.'' It also said ``a diversity of opinion exists
among committed Catholics'' on the issue of abortion.
   Shortly after publication of the advertisement, the 22 nuns and
four priests who signed the statement were asked to recant or face
dismissal from their religious orders. Because Hussey and Ferraro
refused to do so, they expected to be dismissed.
   Last Saturday, the order issued a statement from the Vatican
saying it ``will not proceed with the process to dismiss'' the nuns.
   ``We were as astounded on Saturday upon hearing the decision,''
Hussey said. ``I think they seriously listened to women in our
(religious) community ... who said dismissal and the threat of
dismissal is violent, it's non-gospel and it's non-Christian.''
   The nuns, who work with the homeless in Charleston, W.Va., at
the Covenant House, acknowledged that the Vatican still has the
final word and they could be excommunicated and their superiors
dismissed.
   Hussey said she hoped the Vatican would honor the order's
decision and that ``we will be able to be respected as autonomous
women in religious communities.''
   ``I hope the Vatican clearly knows that dissent is extremely
important to the life of the church and doesn't use its tactics as
it has in the past to squelch dissent,'' she said.
   ``Wouldn't it be wonderful if women now, and men in the Roman
Catholic Church, would not be fearful and would not be afraid to
speak out on their positions,'' Ferraro said.
   She cautioned, however, that those who go public could pay a
price.
   ``People need to realize it will not be without struggle, it
will not be without great personal cost. And based on what we went
through the past four years, it just does not come easily.''

<HEAD>Overhauled Plan To Let Parents Pick Schools From Clusters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of students bused for integration in
Seattle will be halved by 1989, school officials said Thursday
after the first major city to desegregate its classrooms without a
court order adopted a system to educate many pupils closer to home.
   Seattle is adopting a cluster school concept designed after one
instituted in Cambridge, Mass., in 1981. The plan divides Seattle
into eight racially balanced clusters, each with six to 10 schools
from which parents have a ``controlled choice'' of schools.
   Michael Alves, a Massachusetts consultant who has worked on
similar efforts across the country, pronounced the plan
``first-rate'' after it was adopted unanimously Wednesday night by
the city's seven-member school board.
   ``It will maintain desegregated schools, it should work in a way
that is fair, and I think it is constitutionally defensible,''
Alves said.
   Seattle's black civic leaders were among those who had to be
convinced that changing the 10-year-old busing plan would not mean
a return to segregation.
   Lacy Steele, president of the Seattle chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he was
impressed with the work done by Superintenent William Kendrick and
his planners, who spent two years on the cluster program.
   The plan ``should result in less black students being bused
because they have borne the brunt of the busing,'' Steele said.
``We say, on the surface, it seems to be a fair plan.''
   Kendrick hopes the plan, which takes effect in September 1989,
will save money spent on busing and improve classroom learning for
the district's 43,400 students.
   Some schools will be closed and other programs consolidated to
save as much as $2 million the first year and as much as $3.7
million annually in future years, Kendrick said.
   Parents in each neighborhood would pick from two middle schools
and two high schools. Several other schools still would be
available to the whole city at each level, with ``magnet'' programs
attracting those desiring special approaches or concentrations of
study.
   Depending on families' choices, the plan may be totally
voluntary, said Donna Dunning, director of district relations. If
not, school assignments will be made on a first-come, first-served
basis.
   Administrators say at most, 4,800 students will be bused for
desegregation, compared with between 10,000 and 11,000 now riding
buses to keep a racial balance.
   At a cost of $12.2 million per year _ of which the state pays 62
percent _ a total of 22,000 of the district's students are bused,
including some for special education, English as a second language
and preschool needs.
   Changes in the 10-year-old desegregation plan also were needed
because the minority population in the schools climbed from 35
percent in 1977 to 52.5 percent this school year, partly reflecting
a white exodus to private and suburban schools, official said.
   ``It's a plan that many people said needed major surgery,''
Kendrick said. ``We will change the perception that kids are bused
all over the countryside. We will see kids coming back into the
public schools from the private schools,'' he said.
   A major compromise made to meet concerns of some parents allows
``grandfathering'' to keep students entering grades three, four,
six, seven, 10 and 11 next fall at the same schools.
   The plan makes all grade schools teach through grade five, and
middle schools grades six through eight.
   The new plan for the first time includes kindergartners in
mandatory busing outside their neighborhood, but that issue may be
reconsidered, school board members said.
   John Davis, president-elect of the Seattle Education
Association, said the teachers union would closely follow how the
district handles teacher and program transfers.
   ``There are parts of the plan that are there in skeleton form,
and I'm interested in seeing how the flesh is added,'' he said. ``I
have some real concerns about the whole new framework. It's going
to create some initial chaos.''

   Artist George Rodrigue said Thursday he will
have a one-day show on Capitol Hill of paintings that he had to
smuggle out of the Soviet Union following his exhibition there.
   Rodrigue, 43, of LaFayette, La., attracted widespead attention
when Soviet officials ordered him during the Moscow summit to
remove from display his oil paintings of President Reagan and
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Denied exit permits to take his exhibit out of the country,
Rodrigue said he turned to the visiting news media to ferry his 13
paintings back to the United States.
   He said some Americans traveling with Reagan's entourage
volunteered to carry the paintings on Air Force Two, the plane that
ferried the press. Rodrigue refused to identify the couriers, but
he said: ``They didn't have to go through customs.''
   Back in the United States, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., agreed to
co-sponsor the show on Friday ``to allow the American people to see
the paintings that the Soviet people were banned from seeing.''
   No one answered the telephone at the Soviet information office.
A message left on the recording machine was not returned.
   Rodrigue said his experience with Soviet functionaries left him
with a sour taste.
   ``The ordinary people I met were real nice,'' said the Cajun
painter. ``But the Soviet bureaucracy we could not deal with. There
was no negotiation.''
   Rodrigue was invited to the Moscow summit by a Soviet delegation
that hoped to create a Louisiana theme.
   During the summit, 13 of Rodrigue's paintings _ including the
oils of Reagan and Gorbachev _ were to hang in a restaurant at
Moscow's international trade center where a Louisiana chef served
Cajun food. Rodrigue said he was disappointed the Soviet people
could not enter the trade center without special passes.
   The day after Rodrigue put up the oils showing Reagan as a
cowboy on a white horse and Gorbachev carrying a red flag, Soviet
officials confiscated the paintings. Officials gave conflicting
reasons for the action.
   ``They asked `Why wasn't Gorbachev on a horse?''' he said.
``Then they said the paintings were too expensive. ... Then they
asked why Reagan's painting did not have a sun in it.''
   The various reasons were ``real stupid,'' Rodrigue said. ``The
bottom line really is they didn't want the president hanging in a
Russian restaurant. That's what I think.''
   But Rodrigue speculated widespread media attention on the
painting prompted the Soviets to reconsider. Two days before he was
to leave, they re-hung the two paintings.
   Then, he said, various officials tried to persuade him to donate
the picture of Gorbachev to the Soviet Union, an offer Rodrigue
said he would grant only if he could personally hand the painting
to the Kremlin leader.

   The U.S. Embassy issued an ``urgent notice'' to
Americans on Thursday after China warned that terrorists from
another country may be planning attacks on Americans living in the
Chinese capital.
   The unprecedented warning caused the U.S. Embassy to issue an
alert to the 1,500 Americans living in China that they should take
measures to protect themselves, said U.S. consular official Dewey
Pendergrass.
   The embassy said high-level Chinese public security officials
told the embassy Wednesday of possible terror attacks on Americans
by an unspecified third country. The Chinese did not give specific
information about the terrorists or what kind of attacks might be
planned.
   In Washington, a U.S. government official said the Chinese did
tell U.S. authorities that there was Middle Eastern involvement.
   The State Department has said in recent weeks that it suspects
Libyan involvement in a series of terrorist attacks in Latin
America and Europe in April and May. Libya has envoys in China
based at its ``People's Bureau,'' or embassy.
   Asked if Libya was suspected in the threat against Americans in
China, the official in Washington said, ``The country involved was
not specified.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the department
did not issue a travel advisory to tourists because it was a
``generalized threat'' and was issued only against Americans living
in Beijing.
   The embassy notice said officials believe ``this warning
reflects a genuine threat and that American citizens in the Beijing
area should take appropriate steps to protect themselves.''
   A second memo distributed to embassy staff and American
businessmen who held an emergency meeting Thursday afternoon
advised against ``frequenting areas known to be American hangouts''
and wearing clothes that are characteristically American.
   ``We're taking it very seriously,'' Pendergrass said at the
meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing that was
called to discuss the threat.
   The embassy warning was sent to about 1,100 Americans in Beijing
and the port city of Tianjin 60 miles away who have registered with
the embassy. However, embassy officials say they believe 400 to 500
Americans, mostly students, are not registered.
   Security is good in the Chinese capital, which is considered one
of the safer cities worldwide. There have been no reported
incidents of terrorists attacking foreigners or Chinese.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday that the safety of
foreign embassies and citizens in China is ensured.
   Li Zhaoxing, responding to reporters' questions at a weekly news
briefing, said he was not aware of any discussions between Chinese
authorities and the U.S. Embassy on how to prevent possible
terrorist attacks.
   Embassy spokeswoman Sylvia B. Rifkin said the embassy has in the
past sent out similar warnings based on worldwide alerts against
terrorist, but this was the first time the threat was directed
specifically to Americans in China.
   ``Your guess is as good as mine,'' she said when asked who might
be behind the threat.
   The embassy warning recommended that Americans avoid certain
restaurants, markets and nightclubs known to be gathering points
for Americans or foreigners, and report suspicious incidents to the
embassy.
   A 15-point advisory of ``personal security tips'' was
distributed at the Chamber of Commerce meeting Thursday.
   It told Americans, ``don't daydream while traveling to and from
work,'' and that they should ``avoid public gathering places such
as Western hotel lobbies, the airport and tourist restaurants.'' It
added that Americans should not ``be lured into conversations with
strangers and don't agree to meetings arranged through strange
telephone calls or chance encounters.''

   President P.W. Botha on Friday
morning extended the nationwide state of emergency for a third
year, according to a presidential statement.
   The statement came two days after blacks ended their biggest and
longest general strike. The extension takes effect upon publication
Friday in the government gazette.
   Botha said despite success in curtailing violence and unrest, he
believed ordinary laws were still inadequate to ensure public order
and safety.
   ``It is indeed the aspiration of the government that conditions
will change to such an extent that the declared state of emergency
can be lifted,'' Botha said in the statement.
   ``Intimidation and terror are aimed at undermining the
political, economic and social activities of all our communities.
It is also being employed to disrupt our courts and legal
procedures,'' he said.
   There were no immediate details of any possible changes in the
emergency regulations, which allow sweeping powers of detention,
outlaw many forms of peaceful anti-government protest, and restrict
freedom of speech, press and assembly.
   ``We might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent state
of emergency,'' independent member of Parliament Jan van Eck told a
gathering in Johannesburg earlier Thursday. ``A minority regime
will not be able to govern this country without the very wide and
very aribitrary powers afforded by these state of emergency.''
   Despite banning of apartheid groups and restrictions on their
leaders, more than 2 million blacks stayed away from work, school
and shops from Monday to Wednesday.
   The action left streets deserted in major cities such as
Johannesburg and Durban and cost the economy about $250 million,
according to the Associated Chambers of Commerce.
   Botha first issued the nationwide decree on June 12, 1986, after
two years of daily violence that claimed 1,700. By mid-1987 the
violence lessened, but not after an additional 2,500 people died in
township political violence, security force action and in strikes
and other protests against the government's apartheid policies.
   About 100 bombings and land mine explosions have taken place in
the country in the past two years, most of them blamed on the
outlawed African National Congress. The ANC is waging a sabotage
campaign to end white domination of the government and apartheid
legislation which separates the races and restricts where the 26
million black majority may live, attend school, work and play.
   Although the violence has considerably subsided, except for
continual bloodshed between Zulu political groups in the natal
province townships, new emergency decrees were added this year.
   In February, 17 anti-apartheid organizations, including the
United Democratic Front coalition and the Azanian Peoples
Organization, were banned from all political activity. The two
Front presidents and treasurer, the last executive members not in
hiding or in detention, were banned from giving speeches or news
interviews.
   New restrictions on the press have been added periodically.
Journalists now are prohibited from being on the scene of unrest,
reporting security force action, treatment of emergency detainees
and a wide range of political statements the government considers
subversive.
   Two newspapers have been banned this year, and seven others
threatened with shutdown for publishing material the minister of
home affairs considers objectionable.
   When the emergency was reimposed in June last year, about 1,000
detainees were reported to have been technically freed from
detention for a few minutes, then redetained under the new decree
without ever leaving their cells.
   An estimated 40,000 people, including 10,000 children, have been
detained at some time during the past two years, according to the
now-banned Detainees Parents Support Committee.
   Several people detained at the beginning of the emergency,
including a black free-lance journalist and a white university
professor, remained in detention without charge two years later.
   The government has refused, even in Parliament, to give
definitive numbers of people in detention, saying it is not in the
national interest to divulge the information.

<HEAD>25 Years After Wallace's Stand, Racial Gains Noted At University</HEAD>

   At 25 years after George Wallace's
``stand in the schoolhouse door'' at the University of Alabama, one
in 10 of its students is black, and on Thursday the school
sponsored a forum on race relations.
   The conference attracted more than 300 academics, alumni and
journalists. Harry Knopke, a university official who helped plan
it, said the event would mark the anniversary with something
``positive, productive and informative.''
   Since Wallace's showy, futile attempt to block two blacks from
enrolling at the state campus, black students and faculty members
agreed that much progress has been made at the university.
   Three blacks sit on the 15-member board of trustees; five blacks
have been elected homecoming queen and one black as student
government president; and black fraternities and sororities are on
the picturesque fraternity row.
   ``I like going to school up here,'' said Laura Tate, a black
senior from Selma. She said race relations on campus are a
considerable improvement over her hometown, where she said
incidents of racial hostility were commonplace.
   ``But there's always room for improvement,'' she said of the
university.
   Tate recalled her sophomore year, when her sorority, Alpha Kappa
Alpha, was greeted by a burned cross when they moved into a house
on all-white sorority row. Two white male students later were
suspended for the cross burning.
   ``When we acquired the house, they didn't like it. But I think
now people have just gotten used to us being there,'' she said.
   ``The university did react and deal with it in a very forthright
manner,'' said Rhoda E. Johnson, who heads the women's studies
department. She credited the university for efforts to deal with a
problem many institutions have ignored.
   ``At least we are trying to deal with the issue of race
relations at the university. That's a far cry from a lot of other
places,'' she said.
   The first black graduate, Vivian Malone Jones, finished in 1965;
ten years later, 10 percent of the school's students were black.
The figure dipped in the early 1980s and remains at about 9 percent
of a student population now 16,000 strong.
   Knopke, executive aide to the university president, said the
school has succeeded by systematic recruiting that reaches out to
Alabama students as early as ninth grade.
   The school's black enrollment is significantly greater than that
of it cross-state football rival, Auburn University, which had a
3.5 percent black enrollment in 1986.
   Like many other schools, Alabama has had a difficult time
attracting black faculty members. Knopke said about 2.5 percent of
the school's faculty is black _ a figure the school is trying to
increase.
   ``It's a common goal for both the adminstration and the
departments,'' he said. ``We're interested in a setting here that
fosters multicultural development. That's what a university is all
about. That's how people learn.''
   Jarrod Bentley, a black senior from Birmingham, agreed.
   ``I think Alabama has better prepared me to live in the real
world,'' he said. ``In deciding on a college, I wasn't thinking,
`Well, Wallace stood in the door 25 years ago.' I was thinking
about getting an education.''
   Bentley, an accounting major, said he has at times witnessed and
felt discrimination at the university.
   ``I'm not blaming it on the university or the state of
Alabama,'' he said. ``America itself still has a long way to go.''

<TEXT>
   A four-day competition that ended
Thursday pitted highly trained squads against each other from the
East, the West and the Arab world to determine who was best at
thwarting terrorists.
   Austria's Cobra Force won the first three places overall and
also triumphed in the team tactical and obstacle contest. The U.S.
squads, Delta Force and Seal Team Six, took first and third,
respectively, in the combat competition.
   Scores were computed on time and accuracy in fulfiling set tasks.
   Observers saw an American in combat fatigues shoot out five
small balloons, pepper a standing target, blast a line of tin cans,
pump bullets into a human silhouette and smash six plates with
shots from his hip pistol.
   Several miles away, a steel-helmeted Polish police team scaled
walls and went through windows in a simulated raid on a terrorist
safe house.
   Hosts for the competition were the 142 men of the Austria's
Cobra Force, who sponsored the ``anti-terrorist games'' at their
base, the 19th-century Schoenau Castle, to mark the squad's 10th
anniversary.
   Competition began with a combat contest at a shooting range six
miles from Schoenau and a tactical competition to smash a mock
terrorist headquarters at a training complex in a forest south of
Vienna.
   It ended Thursday with a scramble over, across and through
natural and man-made obstacles on the Schoenau grounds.
   Taking part were 145 entrants in team and individual competition.
   Other Western European teams came from France, Italy, Spain and
West Germany. From the Arab world were Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Tunisia. The communist world was represented by China, Hungary,
Poland and Yugoslavia.
   Col. Kurt Werle, deputy chief of the Cobra Force, said the
competition would help improve cooperation among anti-terrorist
squads.
   ``Austria has no home-made terrorism but we have to cooperate
with other countries because we are not an island and terrorism can
come any time,'' he said. ``We must not give it any chances.''
   Among the toughest challenges to the Cobras since the group was
formed a decade ago was an attack by Palestinian terrorists at
Vienna's Schwechat airport Dec. 27, 1985, in which three civilians
and a terrorist were killed.

<HEAD>Program Would Enable Cities To Make New Low-Income Housing Loans.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A corporation formed to help revitalize poor
communities announced Thursday a program to enable cities to sell
unprofitable mortgages and use the proceeds to make additional
low-income housing loans.
   Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., a congressionally chartered
organization, said there were probably about $60 million in
unprofitable mortgage loans now in local government portfolios that
could be liquidated through the program.
   The loans would be purchased by Neighborhood Housing Services of
America, the private business partner of Neighborhood Reinvestment
Corp. NHSA would borrow money to purchase the loans, and the money
would go to the local governments to make additional low-interest
loans for housing rehabilitation in low-income neighborhoods.
   Allstate Insurance Co. has agreed to lend NHSA $10 million for
purchasing the initial loans in the pilot program, officials
announced at a news conference.
   The city of Cincinnati will become the first participant in the
project. Officials said the city would sell a $1 million loan
portfolio, realizing about $600,000 on the sale, to be used for new
loans to rehabilitate about 50 single family homes for low-income
people who would have difficulty qualifying for conventional bank
loans.
   Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp. said there had been discussions
with other cities about participating in the program, but declined
to identify them.

   Air Force investigators picked through
wreckage Thursday for clues to the cause of a plane crash that
killed six Air National Guardsmen as they completed a series of
touch-and-go landings.
   The C-130 transport plane plunged into a soybean field and burst
into a fireball about a mile short of the Greenville Airport on
Wednesday afternoon.
   ``Investigators are looking for important pieces of wreckage,
things that could give us a clue to what happened,'' said Maj. Jim
Bates, a spokesman for Little Rock (Ark.) Air Force Base, where the
plane had left about 1 p.m. Wednesday. ``They'll be able to get an
indication of what the impact was like.''
   Using search lights, rescued workers pulled the last two bodies
from the wreckage of the four-engine turboprop about 1:30 a.m. said
Col. Dennis Wood, interim head of the investigating team.
   At a news conference Thursday, Wood said investigators believe a
student pilot and an instructor were at the controls when the plane
crashed.
   Wood said the plane had just completed a touch-and-go landing at
the civilian airport and was returning for another in a scheduled
training exercise.
   The plane's approach would have completed the exercise, said Lt.
Michele McDowell, a base spokeswoman. ``They were about to get
finished. They were at the end of their training mission there,''
she said.
   Investigators will review control tower tapes to learn what
occurred just before the 2:40 p.m. accident, Wood said. The giant
cargo plane, which was manufactured in 1961, did not have a flight
recorder, he said.
   Newer C-130s have flight recorders, he said, and the Air Force
is modifying older models with recorders _ standard on commercial
airplanes, Wood said.
   In September 1986, a C-130 practicing touch-and-go landings
crashed at Fort Campbell, Ky., killing three of the five National
Guardsmen aboard. A survivor said the plane had lost an engine.
   In June 1987, three Navy aviators died when their EA-3B
Skywarrior electronic warfare jet crashed during a touch-and-go
drill at Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego.
   In touch-and-go drills, a pilot allows the plane's wheels to
briefly touch the runway before taking off again. The drills often
simulate a ground drop in combat conditions, in which cargo would
be dumped out of the moving plane.
   The aircraft was assigned to the 189th Tactical Airlift Group of
the Arkansas Air National Guard.
   A spokeswoman for the Little Rock base, Airman 1st Class Deborah
Doyle, identified the dead as:
   Maj. Andries R. Zwaan, 39, a pilot with the 189th; Staff Sgt.
David Bingham, 24, of the 181st Tactical Airlift Squadron at
Hensley Field in Dallas; 2nd Lt. Mark R. Brandt, 24, of the 180th
Tactical AirlIft Squadron at Rosecrans Municipal Airport at St.
Joseph, Mo.; 2nd Lt. Thomas D. Leece, 28, of the 934th Tactical
Airlift Group of Minneapolis; Master Sgts. Edwin J. Smith Jr., 35,
and Danny W. Holland, 39, both of the 189th.
   The bodies of the six were flown to Keesler Air Force Base in
Biloxi on Thursday morning for autopsies and positive
identifications.
   Air Force officials said Zwaan was the pilot instructor on the
C-130 and Brandt the student pilot.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate George Bush on
Thursday branded Michael Dukakis as an ``out-of-the-mainstream''
politician using ``moderate tones'' in an attempt to attract voters
inclined toward change.
   ``After eight years of one party in the White House, no matter
how successful, some good people will yearn for a change, hoping
that `change' means improvement,'' Bush told the Republican state
convention here.
   ``It's our job to let them know that this time, in this case,
change and improvement comes from the incumbent _ the incumbent
vice president.''
   In his most detailed, point-by-point attack on the Massachusetts
Democrat, his certain opponent in the fall, Bush said Dukakis would
raises taxes, harass Americans with IRS audits, weaken national
defense and advocate an isolationist foreign policy.
   Dukakis' communications director, Leslie Dach, scoffed at Bush's
contentions.
   ``Given where George Bush is in the polls, I think it's no
surprise that he's chosen to spend his time mudslinging and tearing
down,'' he said.
   Shortly before his speech to delegates assembled at the George
R. Brown Convention Center, the vice president told reporters he
was shifting his campaign into a more aggressive stance.
   ``I'm going to spell out the differences. I will do it
factually. I will do it fairly. I want to get it all together,'' he
said.
   In the speech, interrupted several times by applause, Bush said:
``At issue this year are two completely different visions of our
country and where it's going,'' the vice president told delegates
to the Texas state GOP convention.
   Bush said he believes he will do well this fall, despite polls
showing him trailing Dukakis, because he will run a
``look-at-the-record'' campaign.
   He said he and President Reagan inherited a sick country when
they were sworn into office in 1981, with the economy suffering
from ``stagflation'' and the United States suffering foreign policy
defeats abroad.
   ``The patient's back on his feet and better than ever,'' Bush
said. ``And now who do we hear knocking on the door but the doctors
who made him sick.''
   Bush charged that Dukakis would raise taxes and step up Internal
Revenue Service audits of citizens _ with or without justification.
   ``Governor Dukakis operates from the premise that most Americans
must be guilty (of tax cheating),'' he said. ``I operate from the
premise that most Americans are innocent and shouldn't be hassled.''
   On foreign policy, Bush accused Dukakis of favoring a policy of
retreat on the support of burgeoning democracies around the world
while opposing development of new U.S. weapons systems.
   The vice president said the Soviets would never have negotiated
a medium-range missile treaty if there had been the sort of nuclear
freeze that Dukakis advocates. He also chided Dukakis for
advocating greater reliance on multi-lateral bodies, such as the
United Nations, to advance U.S. foreign policy interests.
   ``He's...old-style '60s liberalism,'' on crime, Bush said of
Dukakis.
   Bush claimed that Dukakis lacks experience to make practical
decisions affecting taxes and the overall economy.
   ``When I wanted to learn the ways of the world, I didn't go to
the Kennedy School (at Harvard), I came to Texas,'' he said. ``I
didn't go to a symposium on job creation. I started a business. I
didn't study a monograph on the effects of economic growth, I met a
payroll.''
   ``My opponent is an articulate defender of a flawed world view,
a man who holds strong convictions and who speaks in moderate
tones,'' he said. ``But his views and values are too often, in my
view, out of the mainstream.''
   Earlier, at a news converence, Bush said he didn't put much
stock in polls showing him behind Michael Dukakis because ``I am
convinced the country doesn't want to swing left'' politically.
   ``Yeah, I don't worry about it,'' the vice president said when
asked to comment on a newly released Texas Poll showing him leading
Dukakis in his adopted home state by only 7 percentage points.
   ``I feel really relaxed about it. I really do,'' he said.
``We're not play-acting here. I like fighting back.''
   Bush said he had no quarrel with the way his campaign is being
run, although he acknowledged that ``there will be some changes
along the way.''
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater, while sidestepping the question of
whether Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III would be soon
arriving to head the campaign, strongly suggested that such a move
is in the offing.
   ``My sense is that everybody would love to see Jim Baker as
campaign chairman,'' he said. ``My idea is that anytime that he'd
like to come, we'd love to have him.''

   Michael Dukakis, the all-but-sure Democratic
presidential nominee, met Thursday with Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias and said the United States should encourage democracy in
Central America through economic assistance instead of military
force.
   The Massachusetts governor also attended Harvard University's
commencement, took his wife home from the hospital where she had
spinal surgery six days ago and spent several hours catching up on
state business.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, came under attack from Republican George
Bush, who spoke to Republicans at a Texas state convention in
Houston. Bush attacked the Massachusetts governor for
``old-style...60's liberalism'' whose views are ``out of the
mainstream.''
   ``It's clear that the vice president doesn't think that his own
record or vision can bring him the votes he needs in November,''
retorted Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Dukakis was speaking at a Thursday night victory party
celebrating his Tuesday primary victories clinching enough
delegates to assure his nomination. Dukakis' campaign, meanwhile,
continued a low-key search for a running mate amid quiet
preparations for the Democratic National Convention in July.
   Dukakis, who has been critical of Reagan administration Central
America policies, told reporters after meeting with Arias that if
elected he would ``develop a new relationship based on repect''
with the region's leaders.
   ``We did have an opportunity once again to talk about concerns
that he has and I have and all of us have about Central America,
about his leadership in bringing peace to the region and about the
opportunity economically for development,'' said Dukakis, who held
a similar meeting with Arias several months ago.
   Arias, in Boston to deliver a commencement address at Harvard,
laughed when asked if he would endorse Dukakis for president. He
said he would ``do business with whoever you decide to send to the
White House.''
   He then referred to Dukakis' fluent Spanish and said, ``Perhaps
it's easier, we can get along in the same language. That helps.''
   Dukakis, speaking in Spanish to a television reporter traveling
with Arias, said efforts to remove Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega from power should be centered on negotiations that involve
Central American leaders.
   The governor said the Reagan administration has failed to
consult with Arias and other leaders in the region during efforts
to persuade Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drug charges,
to step down.
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, Dukakis stood by as his wife,
Kitty, thanked the hospital's doctors and staff for caring for her
during her hospitalization after surgery to repair herniated discs
in her neck.
   Mrs. Dukakis said her doctors told her she could remove her neck
brace by next month when her husband formally accepts the
nomination at the Democratic convention.
   Outside the hospital, Dukakis smiled and refused to answer when
asked to comment on Jesse Jackson's assertion that he deserved to
be offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket because of his
strong performance in the primaries. On Wednesday, Dukakis said
Jackson deserved consideration but not a guaranteed offer.
   While Dukakis spent the afternoon at his Statehouse office,
campaign aides met to discuss strategy for weekend meetings in
Michigan where work is to begin on drafting the party's election
platform, a process that will involve negotiations with the Jackson
campaign. Deputy campaign manager Jack Corrigan will lead Dukakis'
delegation to the meetings, bringing with him most of the
campaign's top issues advisers.
   Dukakis is to work at the Statehouse on Friday and attend the
Massachusetts Democratic Convention on Saturday. On Sunday he is to
address the nation's mayors at a national conference in Salt Lake
City. Dukakis will focus on the nation's drug problems and their
effect on families, campaign aides said.
   Several members of Congress are scheduled to visit with Dukakis
early next week before he heads to the South for three days of
campaigning.

   The presidential contenders looked south Thursday, with Democrat
Michael Dukakis pledging a better relationship with Central America
and Republican George Bush traveling to Texas and launching his
harshest point-by-point attack yet on Dukakis.
   In a news conference in his adopted hometown of Houston, Bush
said, ``We differ, the governor and I, a great deal on domestic and
foreign affairs.'' He said he was eager to spell out those
differences because ``I am convinced the country doesn't want to
swing left.''
   Bush, who wrapped up the GOP nomination in April, met in Houston
with the Hispanic caucus to the Texas Republican convention, then
went to the convention floor to address the delegates.
   In his speech, the vice president branded Dukakis an
``out-of-mainstream'' politician with a ``flawed world view.''
   ``He's...old-style 60's liberalism,'' Bush said of his
Democratic rival. He said Dukakis would raise taxes, harass
Americans with IRS audits, weaken national defense and formulate an
isolatinist foreign policy.
   The Dukakis camp quickly fired back, defending Dukakis' record
on crime and his plan to collect unpaid taxes before considering
tax hikes.
   ``It's clear that the vice president doesn't think that his own
record or vision can bring him the votes he needs in November,''
said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Recent polls show the vice president trailing Dukakis by 10
points or more, but Bush said he wasn't worried. ``I feel really
relaxed about it,'' he said. ``I really do. We're not play-acting
here. I like fighting back.''
   In Boston, Dukakis, who mathematically locked up the Democratic
nomination with a four-state primary sweep on Tuesday, held his
second meeting with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias in as many
months. He urged the U.S. government to encourage democracy in
Central America through economic assistance rather than military
force.
   ``We did have an opportunity once again to talk about concerns
that he has and I have and all of us have about Central America,
about his leadership in bringing peace to the region and about the
opportunity economically for development,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor promised that if elected he would
``develop a new relationship based on respect'' with the leaders of
Central America.
   Arias, asked by reporters if he wanted to endorse Dukakis, said,
``I'm sure we'll be a good friend of whoever you decide to elect.''
However, noting Dukakis' ability to speak Spanish fluently, Arias
added, ``Perhaps it's easier, we can get along in the same
language. That helps.''
   Dukakis' discussion with Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace
Prize for his Central American peace plan, also included current
U.S. problems with Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Dukakis, speaking in Spanish to a reporter traveling with Arias,
said attempts to remove Noriega should involve consultation with
Central American leaders _ consultation he said the administration
has neglected.
   Arias and Dukakis also took part in commencement ceremonies at
Harvard University, where the Costa Rican president delivered the
keynote address and the governor joined the school's procession.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis escorted his wife, Kitty, home from
Massachusetts General Hospital, where she underwent surgery six
days ago to repair two herniated discs in her neck.
   Doctors said she will have to wear a neck brace while she
recuperates, but will be allowed to remove the brace by the time
her husband formally receives the nomination at the Democratic
National Convention in July.
   Outside the hospital, Dukakis refused to answer reporters'
questions about rival Jesse Jackson's contention that Jackson's
strong showing in the primaries warrants a vice presidential offer.
Dukakis said Wednesday that Jackson will be considered but no
candidate is ``due an offer.''
   Jackson met Thursday with his advisers at the La Costa resort in
California, where the candidate was resting after a grueling
campaign schedule in which he was on the stump nearly every day. He
has refused to concede the nomination to Dukakis despite the
governor's apparently insurmountable delegate lead.
   Bush, meanwhile, endorsed newly passed legislation that would
expand Medicare to help the elderly deal with the high cost of
serious illness. The Senate passed the bill 86-11 on Wednesday.
   ``The legislation ... will, for the first time since the
founding of Medicare, extend benefits for our seniors,'' the vice
president said in a statement issued by his Washington office.
``Now they do not have to live in fear that their life's savings
would be wiped out by a prolonged hospitalization.''
   In Michigan, a select group of Democratic delegates met with
representatives of the Dukakis and Jackson campaigns to find a
common ground for the party's platform.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, chairman of the Democratic
Platform Committee, set up the meeting in hopes of writing an early
draft that will help the party iron out its differences before the
national convention begins in Atlanta July 18.

   Leftist guerrillas damaged the U.S.
ambassador's residence with mortar fire Thursday. Elsewhere in the
capital, college students protesting a student's death clashed with
security forces at three campuses.
   Police said protesters lobbed dynamite sticks, firebombs and
rocks at police and soldiers who surrounded the schools on foot and
in small tanks and armored vehicles. Eighty students were arrested
and dozens were hurt after police fired buckshot and tear gas.

fired three mortar rounds at U.S. Ambassador Alexander Watson's
home and fled in a waiting car, police said. The roof was damaged
but no one was hurt.
   Watson was eating breakfast in the two-story colonial residence
and his wife and infant daughter also were at home when a 60mm
mortar shell exploded at 6:30 a.m., embassy spokesman Joao Ecsodi
said.
   ``The ambassador thought at first it was the backfire of a car.
It was not a big explosion,'' Ecsodi said.
   It was the third attack at U.S. government buildings in Lima
since April 1986.
   Ecsodi said the mortar round destroyed a ramp and lighting
fixture on the roof.
   A 10-foot-high concrete wall surrounds the residence, on a main
boulevard in Lima. Peruvian police frequently guard the perimeter
while embassy security agents patrol nearby.
   Police said the mortar was fired from a block away.
   Ecsodi said the guerrillas left circulars commemorating the
death of a pro-Cuba guerrilla leader, Luis de la Puente, who
launched his insurgency on June 9, 1965. He was killed in combat
four months later and his group broken up. The Tupac Amaru band
became active in 1984.
   Violence occurred at the main campus of San Marcos University,
about four miles west of downtown Lima; at its medical school
branch on the downtown periphery, and at the suburban National
Engineering University.
   The government had refused to grant permission for a planned
student march Thursday, saying it was fomented by campus-based
supporters of the Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group.
   Security forces surrounded the campuses to keep demonstrators
from parading downtown to mark the death of a student killed in
Lima University protests a week ago.
   Students said they were also protesting an incursion by police
into San Marcos campus last week amid violent demonstrations. More
than 100 students were arrested then, police said.
   Reporters on the scene said dozens of demonstrators were wounded
as protesters tossed rocks and police fired buckshot and tear gas.
   Associated Press photographer Alejandro Balaguer was knocked
unconscious by a demonstrator's rock.
   In highland Apurimac state, Shining Path guerrillas killed a
school teacher, a village police chief and a farm worker in
separate attacks, Santiago Roldan, Apurimac's chief administrator,
said Thursday.
   He said the violence occurred recently in Apurimac towns and
villages, but had no details. Nearly the entire state southeast of
Lima is under a state of emergency because of rebel attacks.

   Striking scriptwriters and producers
negotiated for the seventh straight day on Thursday, while some
optimistic reports emerged for the first time in the 14-week-old
strike.
   The talks resumed Thursday morning at the headquarters of the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Wednesday's
sessin lasted 12 hours.
   ``This is the seventh day of straight talks, and we expect to
have another long day,'' Writers Guild of America spokeswoman
Cheryl Rhoden said.
   Both sides have refused to characterize the talks. But in
discussing a report that a settlement was near, Ms. Rhoden said
``some issues remain unresolved.''
   The entertainment trade paper Daily Variety on Thursday reported
its sources said there was some basis for optimism in the
negotiations.
   The start of the fall television production season usually
begins the last week in June and the first week of July. The CBS
network has already announced a two-month delay for the debut of
its new shows, blaming the lengthy strike.
   Scriptwriters called the industry-wide walkout March 7, when
contract talks broke off over the issues of creative control on the
set and residuals for TV reruns.
   The strike has stalled TV and movie productions, with the
exception of a few independent producers such as Carson
Productions, which signed independent contracts with the union.
   The 9,000-member guild has signed full-term contracts with about
80 producers, but the alliance contends those producers employ only
a fraction of the 3,000 active writers.
   On Wednesday's ``The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson,'' the talk
show host noted in his monologue that it was the first
union-sanctioned show since the strike began. ``Tonight'' went back
on the air in mid-May with Carson writing his own scripts.
   ``Good evening, ladies and germs,'' Carson said, reading from
cue cards. ``It's good to have the highly paid writers back. You
can boo this monologue tonight, but bear in mind each joke has the
union label.''

   The leftist Sandinista government and
the U.S.-backed rebels ended negotiations Thursday without reaching
an agreement on a permanent peace.
   ``It is with deep consternation we announce that an agreement
for a permanent cease-fire was not reached,'' Contra leader Alfredo
Cesar said, reading from a statement.
   The talks ended after both sides exchanged proposals detailing
measures for disarmament of the rebels and bringing democratic
reforms to Nicaragua.
   Cesar said a temporary truce would remain in effect but he would
not say how long.
   ``The war that our people have been suffering for seven years
and that has almost stopped should not be renewed,'' Cesar said.
``The (Nicaraguan) Resistance will not initiate offensive military
operations.''
   He would not say whether further talks would be held.
   ``There is no new meeting programmed,'' he said. ``We have
reiterated our deep conviction to looking to solutions to the
conflict in our motherland in a civilized way.''
   The talks Thursday came on the final day of the fourth round of
talks since the sides signed a cease-fire accord on May 23. The
rebels and the government have been unable to work out the details
by which the rebels would disarm and reforms would take place in
Nicaragua.
   Earlier Thursday, the rebels objected to parts of the
government's proposal, including the Sandinista's amnesty plan and
the lack of a definite time schedule for granting democratic
reforms.
   ``These are fundamental for the (Nicaraguan) Resistance and
makes the difference between an agreement or no agreement,'' Cesar
had told journalists.
   The Contras had maintained that Thursday's talks were the last.
   Paul Reichler, an American lawyer working as a government
negotiator, told journalists sharp divisions among the Contra
leadership caused the talks to reach an impasse Thursday afternoon.
   He said he held several private meetings with Cesar, who told
him the problems were with Col. Enrique Bermudez, the ranking
military leader.
   ``He said Bermudez would follow orders from the (U.S.) State
Department and he called him Colonel America,'' Reichler said,
reportedly relating a May conversation with Cesar.
   Reichler also said he had met with Cesar on May 23 in Miami, and
said the two agreed on six demands by the Contras for bringing
democratic reforms to Nicaragua. He said those rebel demands were
included in the Sandinista's proposal.
   ``We fully expected there would be an agreement two weeks ago
based on what Alfredo (Cesar) told us,'' Reichler said. ``Cesar is
unwilling now to accept the terms he proposed unless Bermudez goes
along.''
   The government proposal, presented Thursday morning by Gen.
Humberto Ortega, called for a gradual political amnesty, with the
first 200 prisoners freed after the signing of an agreement and the
last coming on Sept. 28.
   The rebel proposal called for all of the prisoners to be freed
within five days of an agreement. Contra leader Aristides Sanchez
said it would be a ``show of good faith.''
   The rebels said there are 4,207 political prisoners, while the
International Red Cross, seen here as sympathetic to the
government, put the figure at 3,324.
   The Contras also demand the armed forces totally be separate
from the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front in name as
well as actions. The govenment agreed to the ``separation and
independence of the powers of the state.''
   The rebels want a clear timetable for enacting political
freedoms, including complete pluralism, freedom of expression, the
right to strike, electoral reforms and guarantees of a mixed
economy.
   The Sandinista proposal said those items would be discussed
during 60 days among the 14 political parties and eight rebel
representatives after it was certfied that the Contra combatants
moved into designated zones to disarm.
   The talks would be held before the date set for the fighters to
lay down their arms. The Contras said they needed assurances that
the democratic measures would not only be discussed but enacted.
   Several points in the rebel plan were ruled as unacceptable by
the government during earlier meetings. They included a 90-day
suspension of the military draft; permission for the Contras,
formally called the Nicaraguan Resistance, to open offices in
Nicaragua; and licenses for independent television stations.
   Both sides stopped offensive military operations March 21, the
first day of the first face-to-face talks that led to the plan
signed two days later. A formal 60-day truce ended at the end of
May but both sides extended it. Both sides have repeatedly accused
each other of violating the accord.

<HEAD>Indictment Says Video Mogul Made Illegal Campaign Contributions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The video wizard who marketed Jane Fonda's
workout tapes was charged Thursday with illegally funneling money
to the campaigns of presidential hopeful Gary Hart and other
candidates.
   A federal grand jury indictment accuses Stuart Karl of
conspiracy, false statement-concealment in a matter before a
government agency, making an illegal corporate contribution to a
federal candidate, making excessive contributions to a candidate
and making a campaign contribution in the name of another.
   Karl, 34, of Newport Beach, induced others to make political
contributions supporting candidates he favored in 1984 and 1986,
then reimbursed the donors to elude federal limits on such
contributions, the 12-count indictment alleges.
   The government alleges Karl solicited the small contributions
and that treasurers of the political committees involved declared
them small and lawful contributions made by people other than Karl.
   ``There is no evidence that Mr. Hart or the other senatorial
candidates were aware of the illegal contributions,'' U.S. Attorney
Robert Bonner said at a news conference to reveal details of the
indictment.
   Thirteen of Karl's former employees, used as conduits for the
alleged contributions, were not indicted because most cooperated in
the investigation and have been given limited immunity from
prosecution, Bonner said.
   ``Generally, we are more interested in the person causing the
contributions to be made,'' he said.
   The indictment alleges Karl also used his corporation,
Karl-Lorimar Home Video, to give an illegal $25,000 contribution to
a fund-raiser entitled ``An Evening With Barbra Streisand and Robin
Williams.''
   The fund-raiser benefited various candidates including Timothy
Wirth of Colorado, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Bob Edgar of
Pennsylvania, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and Alan Cranston of
California.
   Bonner and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Stock said a further
grand jury presentation will be made in the case involving other
possible participants in the conspiracy.
   They said members of Hart's political campaign who encouraged
the contributions were still under investigation and Ms. Stock said
that unidentified members of the Hart campaign are cooperating with
the government.
   The indictment contends Karl made $200,000 in illegal campaign
contributions to Hart and other candidates, $38,300 to
congressional and Senate candidates and $159,500 to Hart's 1984
campaign.
   If convicted, Karl faces 36 years in prison and fines totaling
at least $930,000. His arraignment was scheduled in U.S. District
Court in Santa Ana on June 20.
   Karl, who once described himself as a ``humble little guy with
the torn tennis shoes,'' became a millionaire because of his
foresight in the magazine and video markets.
   He started Karl Video in 1979. It was responsible for Miss
Fonda's first ``Workout'' video, which has sold millions of copies.
   After selling his company to Lorimar in 1984 for an undisclosed
amount, Karl became president and chief executive of Karl-Lorimar
Home Video division, with an employment contract running through
1989.
   In March 1987 Karl was forced to resign by Lorimar-Telepictures,
following conflict-of-interest allegations.
   Karl said in an interview then that the company's estimated
annual sales were between $80 million and $100 million.
   In November of 1987, Lorimar-Telepictures filed suit against
Karl, alleging he had violated terms of a financial agreement made
when he resigned from Karl-Lorimar. He denied wrongdoing and the
suit is pending.

<HEAD>Investigators Shut Down Barlowe Clowes Securities Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial investigators closed two Barlowe Clowes
securities management companies that handled $325 million invested
by 7,000 people, news reports said Thursday.
   The Times of London said Peter Clowes, chairman of the parent
company, refused to disclose the whereabouts of $249 million
investors put into Barlowe Clowes International based in Gibraltar.
   Investors of the other closed company, Britain-based Barlow
Clowes Gilt Managers, will get their money back, said Malcolm
London of accountants Cork Gully.
   Specific allegations against the companies were not announced,
but the Department of Trade and Industry began investigating the
two firms last November ``after concern about Barlow Clowes Gilt
Managers,'' Channel 4 said.
   It said action speeded up when the newly established,
government-sponsored Securities Investment Board began to operate
in London's City financial district on April 29.
   It said the board acted May 23 to stop Barlow Clowes Gilt
Managers taking on more business and two days later dealings in the
parent company, James Ferguson, were suspended.
   ``A winding up order against Barlow Clowes Gilt Managers was
obtained on May 27 and on June 7, Barlow Clowes International in
Gibraltar was closed down,'' the report said.
   Channel 4 said Clowes' lawyers in a statement Thursday night
said he was not going to be elusive and was working with them to
find a solution to the problem.
   The Gibraltar company specialized in managing government bonds
known as gilts, from gilt-edged securities, so known because
interest and repayment are guaranteed.
   The Times said Clowes came from the northern city of Manchester
and was associated with a range of bank accounts in London,
Gibraltar, Geneva and elsewhere and was a director of more than 20
companies operating in jewelry, computers, real estate management
and mailing services.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi addressed
fellow Arab leaders in a somber mood Thursday to offer his
apologies for creating an uproar by insulting them at a plenary
meeting earlier in the week.
   Wearing spectacles and with the white hood of his robe pulled
low over his eyes, Gadhafi assured the summit, including 17 other
Arab leaders, that his unprecedented public attacks on them were
not personal but should be considered as ``brotherly squabbles that
only serve to strengthen Arab unity.''
   Gadhafi outraged Arab heads of state at Wednesday's session,
telling them that those among them who cooperate with the United
States were ``lackeys of imperialism and ... can go to hell.''
   He held up the session for more than an hour, refusing to enter
the meeting hall until several leaders had pleaded with him. When
he finally came into the hall, he wore a white glove on his right
hand.
   The Libyan delegation put out word that the glove was intended
to avoid ``contact with traitors'' during the traditional
handshakes.
   He wore no glove while addressing the closing meeting of the
three-day summit, convened to consider the Palestinian uprising in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The rest of his speech was devoted to further exhortations for
Arab unity.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Spread Across Deep South</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled through much of the South on Thursday from
the Carolinas across the Gulf Coast states to eastern Texas, and
temperatures were unseasonably low across much of the nation.
   The storms produced golf ball-sized hail south of High Point,
N.C., and one-inch hail at Lillington, N.C., between Raleigh and
Fayetteville.
   Thunderstorms also developed in the western Plains and in the
Colorado Rockies. Small hail was reported near Colorado Springs,
Colo.
   Rain was scattered over southwest Oregon and northern
California, with the heaviest rain along the coast.
   Rain was widespread along the East Coast from southern New
England to the southern Appalachians.
   Temperatures soared to over 100 degrees Thursday in southwest
Texas and the southeast corner of New Mexico while much of the
nation had afternoon temperatures in the 60s and lower 70s.
   The cool temperatures extended as far south as northern North
Carolina, the Tennessee Valley and northern Arkansas and as far
west as the eastern portions of the northern and central Plains.
   A frost and freeze advisory was posted for Friday morning for
northern Michigan, a freeze warning for the northern mountains of
western Pennsylvania, with scattered frost in Wisconsin, New York
state and northern New England.
   Detroit had a record morning low for the date of 40 degrees,
which was 54 degrees less than Monday's record high. Flint, Mich.,
tied a record low of 35 just two days after a 91-degree record high.
   Other record lows for the date Thursday were Duluth, Minn., 31;
Miami Beach, Fla., 69; and Toledo, Ohio, 38.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Mount Shasta, Calif., to 106 degrees at Del Rio, Texas.
The nation's low Thursday morning was 21 degrees at South Lake
Tahoe, Calif.
   Friday's forecast called for scattered thunderstorms from the
eastern Carolinas to Florida and parts of the central Gulf Coast
region, widely scattered showers in northern Maine and western New
York, scattered thunderstorms over the Rockies and western parts of
the northern and central Plains, showers and a few thunderstorms
scattered in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s over much of
the nation, except 60s or below from the Great Lakes region across
the northern and central Appalachians to the northern and middle
Atlantic Coast states and along the Pacific Coast. Temperatures
were expected to climb to the 90s in parts of North Dakota and
eastern Montana and the 90s to near 105 degrees from southern and
western Texas to the Southwest deserts.

<TEXT>
   The parents of two toddlers crushed under the
wheels of a truck were awarded $25 million Thursday by a jury that
found a ``Walk-Don't Walk'' signal partly at fault.
   The jury awarded the money to Ismet and Fatima Delosovic in
connection with the deaths of their children, Vaid, 3, and Blerini,
5.
   The boys were killed while crossing a major avenue in Greenwich
Village on the morning of May 8, 1981 with their mother and baby
brother, who both suffered only minor injuries.
   Gary Pillersdorf, the Delosovics' lawyer, said the light did not
give pedestrians enough time to cross the street.
   Truck driver Stephen Rapczak, 25, of Garwood, N.J., testified
that he was unable to see the family in the crosswalk when he
proceeded through a green light.
   The truck, owned by Higgins Trucking Co. of Clifton, N.J.,
rolled over the two toddlers, killing them almost instantly, said
Pillersdorf.
   After a 4{-week trial the jury found Rapczak and Higgins
Trucking 44 percent liable in the tragedy, but the Delosovics had
already settled with them for $500,000.
   The remaining 56 percent liability is shared equally by
International Harvester because of alleged poor design of the
truck, and the city because of it design of the intersection and
the functioning of the signal.
   International Harvester and the city, which each would have to
pay $7 million, said they would appeal the verdict as excessive,
according to Pillersdorf.
   Justice Edward Lehner, the trial judge, scheduled a July 15
hearing for motions on the verdict.

   An Arab summit on the PLO-guided
rebellion against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
ended Thursday with agreement by rich Arab nations to subsidize the
uprising.
   A communique issued at the end of the three-day summit said:
``The conference stresses its full commitment to extend all support
needed to secure the continuation and escalation of the uprising
under the leadership of the PLO.''
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat said he
considered the outcome of the summit meeting a victory for both his
guerrilla movement and the uprising.
   Arafat told a conference the funds alloted for the Palestinian
uprising were ``very convenient,'' but he would not disclose
figures.
   Eight delegation chiefs, including the four wealthiest nations,
devised a formula in a 2{-hour meeting for subsidies to the
Palestinians and to Syria and Jordan, which are in the forefront of
the confrontation with Israel.
   In the communique, the 21 Arab League members again designated
the PLO as the ``sole legitimate representative'' of the 5 million
Palestinians.
   They also agreed to oppose any peace initiative that excludes
PLO participation and to demand an international peace conference
giving equal status to all concerned parties, including the PLO.
   The communique ``noted the United States' pro-Israeli bias and
its hostility toward the Arabs and the Palestinians' legitimate
rights,'' and said the summit ``condemned international terrorism
in all its forms, especialy Israel's organized terrorism against
the Palestinian people and the Arabs in general.''
   It condemned ``Iranian terrorism,'' accusing Iran of
``instigating internal unrest, sabotage and other violence'' in the
Persian Gulf nations, and denounced Iran's refusal to end its
8-year-old war with Iraq. Syria, Iran's main Arab ally, ``expressed
reservations,'' a Syrian source said.
   Sources close to the delegates said Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates agreed to ``specific sums'' that would
be provided for the uprising and to Syria and Jordan.
   Chief PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif told reporters, however,
that the Arab leaders agreed to keep the precise sums a secret to
avoid showing their hand to the Israelis.
   Before the report of an agreement, Sharif denied reports that
Arab leaders rebuffed the PLO demand for funds to run the uprising.
``There is no truth to the report.''
   Arafat, the PLO chairman, told the summit earlier in the week
the rebellion was costing his organization more than $50 million a
month in relief, compensation for wages lost by strikers and
medical expenses for injured rioters.
   Conference sources said the PLO agreed in preliminary
discussions to reduce its annual requirements to $300-$400 million,
but spokesmen for the oil-producing nations of the Persian Gulf
said that still was too high.
   Gulf nations will provide funds for the uprising through the
PLO, Jordan and a PLO-Jordanian commission on Palestinian affairs,
the sources said. They said finances would be reviewed later,
possibly at the next regular Arab summit, scheduled for November in
Saudi Arabia.
   A senior delegate said later, however, that all money for the
uprising would go through the PLO. That would underscore the
renewed emphasis on the PLO as the sole representative of
Palestinians.
   The PLO, Syria and Jordan were expected to get some short-term
aid for their own use, but the gulf nations avoided a long-term
financial commitment. They cited chaos in oil markets that
endangered their main source of revenue.
   At a 1978 Arab summit in Iraq, oil states promised the PLO and
nations confronting Israel a subsidy of $3 billion spread over 10
years. King Hussein of Jordan said in a speech Wednesday he had
received only about half the money. Syria and the PLO also have
complained about unfulfilled promises.
   Meanwhile, Syrian President Hafez Assad and Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel moved closer toward reconciliation after two meetings
Thursday focusing on Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war, sources said.
   Assad and Gemayel have been at odds since January 1986, when the
Lebanese president scuttled a Syrian-brokered accord between
Christian and Moslem militias. Gemayel was not consulted before the
signing of the agreement.
   Syria is the main supporter of Lebanon's Moslems. It has more
than 25,000 troops controlling the main Moslem regions in the north
and east as well as west Beirut.

<HEAD>Gandhi Says India Will `Do Our Best' Not to Build Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India said
Thursday ``We've had the means for almost 14 years now'' to make
atomic weapons, ``but we'll do our best not to do so.''
   However, ``it's difficult to say what sort of pressure we would
come under in case Pakistan did build a (nuclear) weapon,'' he
added in a Cable News Network television interview.
   It was one of the bluntest public acknowledgments by any Indian
leader that India's lone atomic explosion in 1974 provided that
Asian country the capability for making nuclear weapons.
   Experts have said this was the case, but official statements
about the blast staged in the Rajasthan Desert by the government of
the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Rajiv's mother, have always
stressed that it was merely ``a peaceful explosion of an atomic
device.''
   Rajiv Gandhi succeeded his mother as prime minister after she
was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards outside her New Delhi home in
1984.
   In other statements Thursday in the United States and Wednesday
in Bonn, West Germany, the prime minister accused India's neighbor,
Pakistan, of aiding Sikh terrorists. He described as ``two big
negatives'' of otherwise much-improved Indo-U.S. relations the flow
of American military aid to Pakistan and what he termed America's
``looking the other way on Pakistan's nuclear program.''
   Gandhi, in New York for the United Nations disarmament
conference, said during the CNN interview: ``It's very obvious that
they (Pakistan) have a nuclear weapons program.
   ``They have a program which is based on well-smuggled or stolen
technologies,'' he continued. ``And it's now pretty obvious to the
whole world where these technologies are being stolen from. And
we're sad that those countries who can control them, put some
pressure on them to stop this program, are not doing so.''
   Gandhi's government has been urging the United States to stop
granting waivers to Pakistan under the U.S. law barring American
aid to countries developing atomic weapons.
   Attempts to smuggle nuclear technology or equipment to Pakistan
from the West have surfaced over the years. Last February, a
Pakistani-Canadian was sentenced to five years in prison after
being convicted in Philadelphia of trying to export illegally to
Pakistan special metals used in atomic bombs.
   Pakistan maintains that its nuclear program is solely for
producing power and other peaceful uses.
   Before leaving Europe on Wednesday, Gandhi charged that by
allegedly helping Sikh extremists, Pakistan was ``perhaps the
largest supporter of terrorism in the world.''
   Disputing the idea that the Sikhs of India's violence-ridden
Punjab state deserve more autonomy, he said, ``They do have
autonomy.'' In the last election, he said, more Sikhs voted than
ever before.

<TEXT>
   Election-day violence left two people
dead Thursday, raising to 12 the number of people killed in the
island's southern province in the last three days.
   Most of the killings have been blamed on extremists of the
Sinhalese ethnic majority, who oppose the elections to the southern
District Council.
   Many voters apparently were discouraged by the violence despite
the presence of thousands of police and members of other security
forces.
   An Election Commission official said turnout reached a low of 15
percent at some voting stations. The province has more than 1.2
million registered voters.
   He said winners of the 53 council seats, contested by 166
candidates, would be announced Friday.
   One of the victims Thursday was a government official fatally
shot while taking food to election workers, police reported.
Special arrangements for feeding workers were made because many
shops and hotels closed in response to threats from the Sinhalese
extremists.
   Police shot a Sinhalese youth to death when he tried to set fire
to a state-owned bus near Tangalle, 90 miles south of Colombo.
   District Councils are a provision of a treaty Sri Lanka and
India signed in July in an attempt to end a separatist war by
rebels of the Tamil ethnic minority. More than 8,000 people have
been killed during the five-year conflict.
   Rebels were to lay down their arms in exchange for more autonomy
in the Tamil-dominated northern and eastern regions, but the
largest group refused and India has sent in more than 50,000
soldiers to fight the insurgents.
   The People's Liberation Front, extremists from the Sinhalese
majority, contends the peace agreement made too many concessions to
Tamils and has said its men will kill anyone who supports the
accord.
   Authorities have blamed 325 killings on the group since the
agreement was signed, including the deaths of 24 candidates in the
seven District Council elections held so far.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population and claim discrimination by the
majority Sinhalese, a predominantly Buddhist group.
   India became involved because it is the main power in the
region, Hinduism is the dominant religion among its 800 million
people and it has a Tamil minority of 60 million in southern Tamil
Nadu state.

   Three inmates shot a guard and took two hostages
Thursday while escaping from one of Canada's oldest and most
notorious prisons.
   The guard at Laval Institute was seriously wounded, but the
hostages were later released in apparently good condition, said
Paul Fournier, a spokesman at the federal maximum-security prison
just north of Montreal.
   The hostages _ a woman prison guard and the driver of a car the
inmates commandeered outside the prison _ were found walking on a
road about 20 miles southeast of the prison.
   Fournier said earlier the guard taken hostage was believed
wounded by gunfire, but later denied it.
   Police throughout the Montreal area launched a search for the
inmates.
   The breakout began Thursday morning in the prison paint shop.
   Rene St. Arnaud, 26, serving a 12-year sentence for armed
robbery; his brother Pierre, 24, doing seven years for robbery; and
Robert Henley, 29, serving a life sentence for murder, overpowered
the woman guard on a walkway overlooking the workshop and took her
hostage.
   The inmates began using a fork-lift truck to get over the wall
of the 115-year-old prison, but they were spotted by other guards.
Gunfire was exchanged, Fournier said.
   The guard who was shot was hit in the shoulder and leg, the
spokesman said.
   Once over the wall, the convicts stopped a passing car, took the
driver hostage and headed toward Montreal.
   Fournier said eachguard at the sprawling prison is armed with a
handgun and semi-automatic rifle. Names of the two hostages were
not immediately released.
   The medieval-looking prison has seen many dramatic escapes and
riots. In September 1986, 286 prisoners caused $500,000 damage in a
rampage to protest living conditions.
   In July 1986, five inmates escaped through a network of air
shafts and tunnels and emerged through a manhole cover outside the
walls.
   Nine prisoners held eight hostages during a three-day
disturbance in August 1980, in which one convict was killed.
   The prison was slated for demolition in 1971 but reopened three
years later because of a lack of prison space elsewhere.

   A federal appeals court agreed Thursday to
reconsider its landmark ruling that struck down the Army's ban on
homosexual soldiers.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Reagan
administration's request to refer the case to an 11-member panel
for a hearing.
   The action removes the legal effect of the Feb. 10 ruling in
which a panel of the court ruled 2-1 that 1981 Army regulations
providing for discharge on the grounds of homosexual orientation
were unconstitutional.
   In the process, the court said homosexuals, as victims of
historic mistreatment, were entitled to the same constitutional
protection against government discrimination as racial minorities.
No other appellate court had ever reached that conclusion.
   The armed services' right to base discharges on homosexual
conduct has been upheld by the courts. But the appeals court, in a
case involving a discharged soldier from the Seattle area, said the
Army's regulations went further into the realm of personal privacy
by applying to sexual orientation, regardless of conduct.
   The government contended the ruling failed to defer to the
Army's judgment in matters of discipline and morale and also was
inconsistent with the Supreme Court's 1986 ruling upholding an
anti-sodomy law in Georgia.
   The 25-judge appeals court did not state a reason for referring
the case to an 11-member panel or give details of its vote. No date
was set for a hearing.
   An official of a gay-rights legal group described Thursday's
decision as a momentary setback.
   ``The initial decision was cause for celebration,'' said Leonard
Graff, legal director of National Gay Rights Advocates in San
Francisco. ``The struggle for equal rights for lesbians and gay men
is a long-term struggle. Realistically, we have to expect some
setbacks. That doesn't mean we give up.''
   The case involves Perry Watkins, 39, who enlisted in the Army in
1967 at age 19 and said he had homosexual tendencies. His lawyer,
James Lobsenz, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the
decision, and expects the case to wind up in the Supreme Court if
he wins the next round.
   ``That's why I did not advise homosexual members of the Army
(after the February decision) to come out of the closet and say,
`Here I am, you can't touch me,' '' said Lobsenz.
   At the time Watkins enlisted, the Army discharged soldiers for
sodomy and other specific acts, but not for homosexuality itself.
However, homosexual orientation was declared grounds for discharge
under regulations adopted in 1981. Nearly 1,400 people were
discharged from all the armed services for homosexuality in the
fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, the government said.
   Watkins, who had been supervisor of the Fort Lewis personnel
administration center and had high job ratings, was discharged in
May 1984. In the Feb. 10 ruling, the court said the Army must
reconsider Watkins' application for re-enlistment without regard to
his sexual orientation.
   Watkins said then that he would like his old job back, but he
was blocked from re-enlisting pending the government's appeal.
   ``Laws that limit the acceptable focus of one's sexual desires
to members of the opposite sex, like laws that limit one's choice
of spouse (or sexual partner) to members of the same race, cannot
withstand constitutional scrutiny absent a compelling governmental
justification,'' said the majority opinion by Judge William Norris,
joined by Judge William Canby.
   Norris held that the Army's argument that homosexuals would hurt
morale and discipline was an attempt to ``illegitimately cater to
private biases.''
   The dissenter from February's ruling, Judge Stephen Reinhardt,
condemned the 1986 Supreme Court ruling upholding a Georgia
anti-sodomy law, but said the high court had set a precedent
against recognizing constitutional protections for homosexuals.
   Watkins said he wasn't surprised by the court's action and said
he expects the case to go to the Supreme Court if the Army doesn't
relent.
   ``The ruling is so broad, it affects too many people for the
Army to let it go,'' Watkins said in a telephone interview from his
Tacoma home.
   ``What people need to start looking at is, this kind of ruling
doesn't affect just people who are gay. If the army can do this to
people because they want to, then they can do it to anyone for any
reason,'' he said.

   Former Gov. Ray Blanton of Tennessee, whose
1981 felony conviction in a liquor license conspiracy case sent him
to prison for two years, was married Thursday evening to a longtime
friend near the U.S. Capitol.
   Blanton, who is running for Congress in Tennessee, married Karen
Flint, whom he has known since the late 1970s when he was governor
and she was a staff member of the Appalachian Regional Commission.
   It was the first marriage for Ms. Flint and the second for
Blanton, who was divorced from his first wife, Betty, in April 1987.
   Friends said no honeymoon is immediately planned and that
Blanton and his new wife would immediately return to Tennessee
where he will resume his campaign for the state's 8th District
congressional seat.
   The groom wore a tuxedo and the bride a white dress and matching
veil. They emerged briefly outside the Democratic Club on Capitol
Hill, where the private ceremony was held, to pose for pictures,
but neither talked with reporters or answered questions.
   Blanton gave a thumbs up gesture when asked how the wedding
went. As the couple retreated back into the building, he was heard
saying, ``We enjoyed this.''
   Members of the bride's family said about 80 to 90 people
attended the ceremony performed by James Ford, the chaplain of the
House of Representatives.
   The bride's family is from suburban Arlington, Va., but she
lives in Nashville where she has a real estate license.
   Blanton was the governor of Tennessee from 1975 to 1979. Two
years after he left office, Blanton was convicted of mail fraud,
extortion and conspiracy in connection with the issuance of state
liquor licenses.
   He served two years in prison on the charges.
   The mail fraud charges later were vacated as a result of a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling, but the others charges remain under appeal.

   Vietnam's foreign minister said Thursday
that Vietnamese who worked for the United States during the war may
go to America if there are assurances they will not mount attacks
on their native country.
   Since South Vietnam fell and the country was reunified in 1975,
about 900,000 former South Vietnamese officials and U.S. employees
have undergone political ``re-education,'' according to the State
Department.
   ``We have declared that we are ready to let them go if there is
a guarantee for our security,'' said Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach. ``That means they must not be allowed to have hostile
activities focused toward Vietnam.''
   He told reporters at a breakfast news conference that ``some
tens of thousands'' of people may be leaving and that U.S. and
Vietnamese officials agreed to meet in Hanoi in July to discuss
security guarantees and other details.
   On Thursday, Thach met with retired Army Gen. John W. Vessey
Jr., President Reagan's special envoy on this and other
humanitarian issues involving Vietnam.
   ``I have asked Gen. Vessey if he would like to have all the
people who cooperated with (South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van)
Thieu's army, and he said that would be too much,'' said Thach.
   He reiterated Vietnam's pledge that by 1990 it will withdraw all
its troops from neighboring Cambodia, which it invaded in late 1978
to topple the Khmer Rough government of Pol Pot. Both Vietnam and
Cambodia are communist countries.
   ``If Vietnam is not out by 1990, we could be bogged down forever
in Cambodia,'' said Thach.
   ``We were there (originally) with more than 200,000 soldiers; we
have withdrawn 82,000 to 87,000,'' he said, adding that 50,000 more
will be withdrawn this year.
   It is estimated that 2 million people _ a fourth of Cambodia's
population _died in executions, famine and civil war from
1975-1979, under the radical Khmer Rouge communist regime.
   Thach said Vietnam's troops will leave even if there is no
political agreement for a transition government, but added: ``With
a political settlement, you can have security.''
   He also indicated that Vietnam will not invade again even if Pol
Pot returned to power:
   ``The Western countries condemned Pol Pot from 1975-1978, when
Vietnam recognized Pol Pot ... and we have criticized Pol Pot with
arms after that. We were criticized by the West. If Pol Pot returns
again, it is the responsibility of the Western countries to
criticize him,'' said Thach.
   The United Nations and the United States do not accept the
Vietnam-installed government of Cambodia as legitimate, instead
recognizing the rebel coalition of the Khmer Rouge, forces under
former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the
non-communist forces of former Cambodian Premier Son Sann.
   Thach said that he was sure the Cambodian people would not allow
Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to rule again.
   ``If there was world condemnation of the crimes of Pol Pot, it
would demoralize his followers,'' he added.

   A group seeking to deliver 30 tons of food,
clothing and medical supplies to Nicaragua camped at this border
city Thursday and plotted how to win reversal of a federal policy
blocking the mission.
   ``We are kind of holding our place here today, waiting for the
pressure to build,'' said Gerry Condon, an organizer of the
Veterans' Peace Convoy to Nicaragua. ``We are hoping it won't be
long, because there are people here who want very bad to make this
trip to Nicaragua.''
   The convoy began from four different regions of the country on
May 21, and arrived at Laredo Tuesday night, planning to cross into
Mexico on Wednesday morning. But Treasury Department officials said
the group's plans to leave the 37 trucks, buses and cars hauling
the cargo in Nicaragua would violate a 1985 trade embargo.
   Ninety-four convoy members have made a commercial campground in
northern Laredo their base since Wednesday. At the campground
Thursday afternoon, members sought shade from temperatures over 100
degrees and planned strategies.
   The group got support Thursday from about 50 people picketing
the federal building in Austin and from U.S. Rep. Albert
Bustamante, D-Texas, who wrote Treasury Secretary James Baker on
Thursday urging him to allow the convoy to cross the border for
humanitarian reasons.
   A Treasury Department spokesman in Washington said Thursday that
the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control told convoy
supporters last month that taking the vehicles into Nicaragua would
require a license and posting of bonds to assure their return to
the United States within 30 days.
   ``They were notified in late May what the law was and what the
facts were on what can be exported to Nicaragua,'' said the
Treasury spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I mean
there's no surprise here.''
   Condon said the convoy's position is that the vehicles are
needed to distribute the supplies, and are a form of humanitarian
aid allowed under the embargo.

   President Reagan joined with President Mobutu
Sese Seko of Zaire in offering praise Thursday for Jonas Savimbi,
the guerrilla leader trying to overthrow Angola's communist
government, the White House said.
   During their 15-minute White House meeting, the two presidents
also thanked each other for backing solutions to problems in
southern Africa and Angola, where the United States has been
pressing for the pullout of pro-government Cuban military forces,
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The White House issued a statement later Thursday saying Reagan
and Mobuto agreed to support the goal of independence for South
Africa-controlled Namibia and peace and reconciliation between the
Angolan government and the UNITA guerrillas in Angola.
   Accusations that Zaire tortures prisoners and commits other
human rights abuses were not raised at the White House session,
Fitzwater said. The accusations were disputed by Mobutu in a brief
talk with reporters.
   ``You can only oppress a people if they do not have confidence
in you, which is not the case in Zaire, contrary to what has been
written,'' he said.
   Mobutu, on a private visit to the United States, said the main
purpose of his White House call was to thank Reagan ``for all he
has done for Zaire in the framework of the friendship and
solidarity which exists between our two countries.''
   He also congratulated Reagan ``for the successes he had during
the Moscow summit .. he has given a glimmer of hope to all of
humanity.''
   The Zairean president was also meeting with U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Banker and with officials of the World Bank, which
last year granted his country an $80 million loan.

<HEAD>Army Picks Colorado, Texas Locations As Preferred Missile
Destruction Sites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pueblo Depot Activity here and the
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, are the
preferred sites for destroying Pershing missiles under the INF
treaty, the Army announced Thursday.
   The Army advised the governors of both states of its choices for
handling deactivation of missiles under the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty ratified last month by the United States and
the Soviet Union.
   The Army already has permission from the Texas Environmental
Regulatory Agency to eliminate rocket motors at Longhorn, and could
begin work in August.
   Colorado officials are awaiting results of a recent test
elimination before deciding on the Army's request for a permit to
burn motors at Pueblo, according to PDA spokeswoman Mary Wilson.
   The Army wants to dispose of rockets by static firing, in which
a non-refillable rocket engine is strapped down and fired,
exhausting its fuel.
   In addition, the Army plans to dismantle Pershings and eliminate
certain other components such as missile nose structures and some
mobile director-launchers at Pueblo by cutting them up or crushing
them.
   To comply with the INF treaty, the United States must eliminate
all of its shorter-range Pershing 1As within 18 months and
intermediate range Pershing IIs within three years. All U.S.
Pershing 1A missiles are in storage at Pueblo.
   Pershing II missiles would be shipped to Pueblo from eslewhere
in the United States and Europe.
   The destruction of the several hundred missiles involved must be
opened to Soviet observers under the terms of the treaty, just as
Soviet elimination of its missiles must be open to U.S.
representatives.
   Work in Texas could begin in August, Wilson said, while the
Colorado work depends upon state environmental approval.

<HEAD>Underground Church Seeks Help from Vatican</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of an underground Catholic church said
Thursday they were seeking help from a Vatican official when he
presents a message from Pope John Paul II to Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Ivan Gel, a leader of the underground Ukrainian Catholic Church,
said several bishops, priests and laymen from the church went to
Moscow planning to meet Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, who arrived
Wednesday for a Russian Orthodox celebration of the 1000th
anniversary of Christianity in this land.
   ``We will put the question to him about the restoration of the
legal status of the Ukrainian Catholic Church,'' Gel said.
   Casaroli is carrying a message from the pope to Gorbachev but
has not divulged the contents.
   Other members of the Roman Catholic delegation led by Casaroli
said some contact with the Ukrainians was likely, but they could
not say whether there would be a meeting.
   The Ukrainian Catholic Church, which has its roots in the
western Ukraine, ceased to exist officially in 1946 when it
officially was united with the Orthodox Church. But Gel, who is
from the western Ukrainian city Lvov, said at least four to five
million worshipers continue to attend the underground services.
   Gel, who said he spent 18 years in labor camps and exile for his
religious activities, said the last of the church's political
prisoners was released in November 1987.
   Instead of arresting clergy and believers who are practicing
their faith, authorities now regularly levy fines of about $80 for
unsanctioned religious services, Gel said, adding that parishioners
take up collections to pay the fines.
   Gel credited Gorbachev's reforms with easing the problems of
Ukrainain Catholics. ``The democratization of society enables a
greater satisfaction of our spiritual needs,'' he said.
   But the church has not been officially recognized. The Russian
Orthodox Church is bitterly opposed to recognition of the Ukrainian
church, claiming it was formed only as a result of a forced split
in the Orthodox Church at the end of the 16th century.
   The Russian Orthodox Church ended its four-day millennium
council Thursday at a monastery in the city of Zagorsk, about 35
miles northeast of Moscow.
   Metropolitan Filaret of Kiev and Galich said the council had
approved construction of a home for old priests and others
connected to the church, in what could be a tentative step away
from government controls on religious activity.

<TEXT>
   The prosecution picked Oliver L. North to be
the lead-off defendant in the first of four Iran-Contra conspiracy
trials but suggested trying him with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh notified U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of his selection of North but also asked
the judge to consider the alternative of empaneling two juries for
one trial of the fired National Security Council aide and his
former boss.
   Walsh, who also proposed a joint two-jury trial for arms dealers
Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord, said this procedure still would
protect each defendant's constitutional rights against the
prejudicial use of immunized congressional testimony.
   Gesell ruled Wednesday that four separate trials were necessary
to allow one defendant, say North, to use the immunized
congressional testimony of Hakim or Poindexter, for example, as
evidence to defend the charges against him.
   The judge ruled that because the independent counsel statute
dealt with wrongdoing by high-level government officials, North and
Poindexter should be tried first. He gave Walsh until Friday to
designate the lead-off defendant.
   North indicated he was unconcerned by being selected for the
first trial or being tried separately from his co-defendants.
   ``I guess Winston Churchill probably said it best,'' North told
CBS News. ``He said never give in _ never, never, never give in.
And whether I have to fight this thing out alone in the courtroom
or with others, we will fight it out to the end and in the end, we
will win.''
   In court papers, Walsh said his proposal for two dual-jury
trials ``would meet the court's interest in protecting the rights
of the defendants while alleviating the enormous burdens on the
government of trying each defendant sequentially.''
   In a two-jury trial, one panel would hear the evidence against
one defendant and the other would consider the case against the
second defendant. One of the juries would leave the courtroom
before a defendant introduced evidence prejudicial to the other,
such as immunized congressional testimony.
   Walsh cited seven previous multijury federal court trials in
which the procedure was upheld on appeal.
   These included a 1982 dual-jury bribery trial of two District of
Columbia officials. U.S. District Judge Charles Richey empaneled
two juries because one of the defendants had given a confession
that was inadmissible against the other.
   All the defendants except Secord, a retired Air Force major
general, were given limited grants of immunity from prosecution by
Congress to compel their testimony before the congressional
Iran-Contra hearings last year. Walsh cannot use the immunized
testimony of a defendant against that individual.
   But Gesell has ruled that the defendants could use each other's
immunized testimony to help their defense.
   In his filing Thursday, Walsh said it would be logical to try
Poindexter and North together because they both are accused of
``using their positions of trust and power to facilitate and
protect an illegal financial and logistical network'' to help the
Nicaraguan rebels by privately raising money and diverting profits
from the U.S.-Iran arms sales.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant-colonel, and Poindexter, a
retired Navy rear admiral, are accused of ``numerous acts of
obstruction of justice and false statements intended to cover up
the activities of the `Enterprise''' Walsh said.
   Similarly, Hakim and Secord, former business partners who
brokered the arms deals through a series of foreign companies and
secret Swiss bank accounts, are both charged with conspiracy to pay
illegal gratuities to North by setting up a $200,000 trust fund for
his family, Walsh said.
   All four defendants are charged with conspiracy to defraud the
government, theft of government property and wire fraud.
   ``The evidence the government would offer at separate trials of
North and Poindexter and of Secord and Hakim would be
overlapping,'' Walsh said. But two dual-jury trials ``offers clear
advantages in terms of judicial efficiency, conservation of the
government's resources and speedy adjudication of the cases.''
   ``Four separate and sequential trials will result in at least
some of the defendants living under the cloud of an indictment for
several months,'' Walsh said.
   ``The government will be forced to incur the substantial expense
of trying four cases involving substantially similar proof and
witnesses, including the costs of maintaining the Office of
Independent Council'' and an elaborately guarded security facility
built at government expense for the defense lawyers to examine
reams of classified documents collected during the investigation.
   Walsh's request for two trials instead f four appeared to be
intended to lessen some of the tactical disadvantages that legal
experts said he would face if forced to try the four defendants
separately.
   Former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said Gesell's ruling on
Wednesday presented Walsh with his ``worst-case scenario.'' He and
other former prosecutors say getting conspiracy convictions is
difficult when only one alleged conspirator is in the courtroom.
   Four separate trials also would force Walsh to disclose evidence
he intends to use against the other defendants long before they
must stand trial. Walsh also would be forced to divide his staff
into four separate trial teams because of the inevitable exposure
to immunized congressional testimony.
   Legal experts said they viewed the North case as the logical
place to start prosecuting because of the breadth of charges
against him. The indictment contains 16 counts against North,
compared with seven naming Poindexter.
   Among the additional charges, North is accused of obstructing
the FBI investigation of the installation of a $15,000 security
fence around his suburban Virginia house and for accepting payment
for it from Secord. He also is accused of pocketing $4,300 of the
$90,000 in travelers checks given to him by a Contra leader to
cover expenses.
   He also is accused of conspiring with two conservative
fund-raisers to use a tax-exempt foundation illegally to raise
private donations for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``You pick North first because he is the top banana in terms of
expansiveness'' of the evidence, said diGenova.
   ``It gives you the chance, if you are only to have one trial, to
get most of your evidence in and tell your story about the
conspiracy,'' he said, referring to the possibility of presidential
pardons that might avert subsequent trials.

   A Presbyterian statement that would declare
nuclear war immoral went before a church panel Thursday, after foes
of the controversial paper sought a one-year delay for the
3-million-member denomination to discuss it.
   The paper, ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' is the
result of a five-year process in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.),
and has drawn the most interest among issues before the church's
200th General Assembly in St. Louis.
   Other issues include health care, pornography, AIDS, religious
freedom, Central America and concerns including the election next
week of one of the top denominational staff officers.
   The ``Christian Obedience'' paper's recommendations include
declarations that both nuclear war and the theory of nuclear
deterrence are immoral.
   It also discusses tax resisters, saying the church should not
adopt a policy of resistance, but be willing to support its members
who feel called upon to resist.
   The paper also says the decision to go along with government
policy should be as painstakingly taken as the decision to resist.
   Presbyterians for Democracy and Religious Freedom, a sanctioned
group in the denomination, say the paper encourages tax resistance
and does not reflect the majority viewpoint of the nation's largest
Presbyterian denomination.
   The paper is a ``partisan document,'' that gives short shrift to
opposing views, the Rev. Paul Scotchmer, PDRF executive director,
told the assembly Committee on Peacemaking and International
Relations at a hearing Wednesday.
   PDRF President John Boone, a layman from Tennessee, said if the
paper is as solid as its supporters believe, ``it can stand the
test of one year.''
   Also opposing the paper is The Presbyterian Council for
Chaplains and Military Personnel, whose director Charles E.
McMillan told the committee the paper glorifies conscientious
objection while denigrating military service.
   The Rev. Harry Hassell of Highland Park Presbyterian Church in
Dallas, the largest church in the denomination, urged the committee
to replace references to tax resistance with discussions on a
Christian's responsibility to pay taxes while working within the
system for change.
   The committee of 58 clergy, laity, seminary and youth delegates
split up into subcommittees later Thursday, with a 16-member group
assigned to deal with the ``Christian Obedience'' document.
   That group, chaired by the Rev. Thomas J. Heger, a campus
minister from Eugene, Ore., can recommend revisions, withdrawal or
acceptance of the document.
   It will report to the full committee Saturday with the full
assembly scheduled to take up the paper Tuesday night, the next to
last day of the convention.
   Heger said he could not predict how his subcommittee might
handle the report, but in discussions Thursday night, the panel
removed some language and changed other wording in the 5{ pages of
recommendations.
   Panel members felt some language placed resistance to government
policy on the same level as cooperation, and changed language which
they felt could be interpreted as routinely offering financial
support to government resisters.
   Other recommendations which have not been dealt with include
suggestions the church offer legal aid for conscientious objectors
and financial aid for their families.
   A separate recommendation is the creation of a voluntary Fund
for Obedience to Higher Authority ``for those who suffer financial
loss or difficulty as a result of acts of conscience.''

   Patient trials are beginning on a
vaccine to prevent recurrence of melanoma, a hard-to-treat skin
cancer that strikes about 27,000 Americans eash year, the vaccine's
developer said Thursday.
   ``What it means is there is potential for some hope, and perhaps
we're going to be able to immunize a patient against potential
recurrence,'' said Marc Wallack, a cancer specialist and chairman
of general surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
   He is coordinating a three-year study on at least 200 patients
around the nation who have had melanomas surgically removed but are
at high risk of the cancer returning, spreading and killing them.
   The trials are under way at the University of Florida; Duke
University in Durham, N.C.; M.D. Anderson cancer institute in
Houston; the University of Alabama; and Emory University in
Atlanta, he said.
   Cancer vaccines aren't a new idea, and vaccines for various
cancers are being studied around the nation. They aim to prevent
cancers from returning by ``waking up'' the body's immune system so
it will seek out and destroy cancer cells that may have broken off
a tumor and migrated, thus escaping surgical removal.
   Dr. Philip Livingston of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York is working on a different type of vaccine for melanoma, which
resists traditional chemical and radiation therapies.
   ``I'm not saying one is better than the other, but it's a
different approach,'' said Livingston, whose work uses purified
chemicals taken from cancer cells, while Wallack's uses cancer-cell
membranes mixed with smallpox vaccine virus.
   In Wallack's ``vaccinia melanoma oncolysates'' vaccine, four
types of melanoma cells are infected with smallpox vaccine viruses.
Membranes from infected cells are injected into patients weekly for
13 weeks, and then bi-weekly for the remainder of one year.
Smallpox energizes the immune system, alerting it to the cancer, he
believes.
   The study is double-blind, meaning neither doctors nor patients
know who is getting vaccine and who is injected with a placebo.
During follow-ups, Wallack will compare the cancer recurrence and
survival rates of the two groups of patients.
   Researchers wonder if extracts from the four melanoma cells used
in Wallack's study will trigger immune systems for the dozens of
types of melanoma, Livingston said.
   ``It's a little bit of a shot in the dark in that regard,'' he
said.
   Wallack said the four cell types he's using should prove
effective on all melanomas. And if his preliminary test results are
repeated, the vaccine will help at least 15 percent of the
patients, he said.
   Skin cancers are diagnosed in about 500,000 Americans each year
and are readily cured by surgical removal _ except for advanced
melanoma, recent American Cancer Society figures show. Of about
7,800 annual skin cancer deaths, 5,800 involved melanoma.

   President Reagan has nominated three Army
major generals for new assignments and promotions to three-star
rank, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, the Pentagon said Maj. Gen.
Johnnie H. Corns would be promoted to lieutenant general and become
the head of the U.S. Army Japan. Corns, 52, is a native of Gordon,
W.Va., who is currently serving as the commanding general of the
6th Light Infantry Division at Fort Richardson, Alaska.
   Maj. Gen. Leonard P. Wishart III has been nominated for the rank
of lieutenant general and a new assignment as the deputy commanding
general of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command and
commanding general of the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, the Pentagon said.
   Wishart, 53, is a native of Newark, N.J. who is currently
serving as the head of the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley,
Kansas.
   The third promotion involves Maj. Gen. Robert D. Hammond, the
Pentagon said. He has been nominated for promotion to lieutenant
general and reassignment as the head of the Army Strategic Defense
Command, the Army component of the Star Wars research effort.
   Hammond, 55, is a native of Altadena, Calif., who is currently
serving as the head of the Space and Special Weapons Directorate in
the office of the deputy chief of staff for operations and plans.

<TEXT>
   A conference on East-West security
opened in Potsdam Thursday with strong attacks by Western officials
on what they called ``propagandistic'' disarmament proposals often
put forward by the Soviet bloc.
   Parliamentarian David Owen, leader of Britain's reformist Social
Democratic Party, said he rejects East bloc proposals that all
nuclear weapons be removed from Europe. He called such ideas
``naive nonsense ... and sheer propaganda.''
   ``If the Soviets retain their weapons and Western Europe does
not'' the nuclear threat to the West only increases, Owen said.
   Jack Matlock, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, also accused the
Soviets of making proposals with propagandistic intentions.
   ``From time to time we face proposals that smack of this,''
Matlock said, without going into specifics.
   Owen also took issue with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
contention at the latest U.S.-Soviet summit that the West has no
right to try to dictate Kremlin human rights policies.
   ``Respect for human rights under internationally agreed norms is
certainly an important area,'' he said.
   Oskar Fischer, East Germany's foreign minister, sided with
Gorbachev on the human rights issue in opening the three-day
conference in this East German city southwest of Berlin. The
conference is being sponsored by the Institute for East-West
Security Studies in New York City.
   Fischer said: ``The meaning of all human rights is turned upside
down if the attempt is made ... to make one's own system of society
and one's own values the measure of all things, and to judge other
states by these standards or even impose one's views on them.''
   He added, ``While we do not force our convictions upon anybody
else, we expect others to do likewise.''
   Fischer also renewed his calls for a nuclear-free corridor about
150 kilometers (93 miles) wide along the borders between NATO and
Warsaw Pact nations.
   Fischer said the Warsaw Pact is ``ready for the most radical
reductions in the conventional field.''
   But he did not say if the Soviet bloc is willing to concede to
the kind of asymmetrical reductions demanded by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   Fischer also urged both sides to work closer in the economic
sphere, saying:
   ``The arms race is putting an almost unbearable burden on the
economies of both East and West. Engaging in competitive armament
while trying to resolve global problems exceeds the economic
capacities of all our countries.''
   Others scheduled to address the conference include U.S. Commerce
Secretary William Verity; West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and John Whitehead, U.S. deputy secretary
of state.

<TEXT>
   The United States and its 15 NATO allies
agreed Thursday to press the Soviet Union for human rights reforms
before entering negotiations to reduce troop concentrations in
Europe.
   Despite the ``glasnost'' or openness initiated by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the allies agreed Soviet practices were
lagging far behind democratic declarations.
   The troop reduction talks are supposed to be held in Vienna
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven-nation
Warsaw Pact. The idea is to ease tensions from the Atlantic to the
Ural mountains after a 15-year impasse over reducing non-nuclear
forces in Central Europe.
   Summarizing the Western allies' stance at NATO's spring meeting
in the Spanish capital, a senior U.S. official said the decision
was that ``we ought to wait and see what the Soviets do in the area
of human rights first.''
   The official, who held a briefing under condition of anonymity,
said there was ``solid agreement'' on the position among the allies
and that Secretary of State George P. Shultz did not have to take
the lead in persuading the other NATO foreign ministers to go along.
   President Reagan, during his summit trip to Moscow, stressed
failure in Soviet bureaucracy rather than Soviet policy itself for
the deficiencies in the human rights situation.
   But Shultz and his senior advisers are also disappointed that
the reforms promised by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in
a pre-summit meeting with Shultz last month in Geneva had not been
adopted _ or found their way to the negotiating table in Vienna.
   Also, the Soviets have not agreed to permit monitors to report
on their compliance with human rights accords and 20 monitors who
were policing the 1975 Helsinki Agreement are still in jail, the
official said.
   The United States also is pressing the Soviets to release
prisoners jailed for their religious beliefs and wants the right of
appeal granted to Soviet citizens who are refused exit permits.

<HEAD>Ingmar Bergman's Production of `Hamlet' Travels to Brooklyn</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nothing is quite what it should be in the world
created by director Ingmar Bergman for his startling, violent and
often mesmerizing production of ``Hamlet'' which arrived this week
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for an eight-performance run.
   In Bergman's unnerving creation for the Royal Dramatic Theater
of Sweden, Denmark becomes an environment of decay, sexual excess,
psychotic behavior and ultimately needless slaughter carried out to
ear-bursting pop music and the whir of minicams and tape recorders.
   Elsinore has been transformed into a castle of lost souls where
a drunken king and queen have sex in public while the court titters
and applauds, Polonius preaches like a stuffy British barrister,
Ophelia becomes a disheveled flower child gone mad, the Gravedigger
turns into an existential comic waiting for Godot and Fortinbras
storms the stage as a black-bereted guerrilla leader.
   At the center of Bergman's chaos stands a tall, dark, brooding
Hamlet who would not look out of place in one of New York's tonier
rock clubs. Dressed entirely in black and wearing sunglasses, the
actor slouches on stage. As played by a fascinating and forceful
actor named Peter Stormare, this Hamlet arrives with a Marlon
Brando swagger and a Norman Bates psychosis.
   Stormare, an intense, hawk-like presence, brings a wild energy
to the 3{-hour production. The actor is not an introspective Hamlet
calmly reasoning out what should be done. This prince rails against
the world and what has happened to the kingdom since his uncle
murdered his father and married his mother.
   When this Hamlet acts, he gets carried away. When he kills
Polonius, he stabs him in the eye and then scrawls the word `blood'
on the wall. When he tells Ophelia to ``get thee to a nunnery,'' he
nearly rapes her in the process.
   There is one radical change in the text, involving the transfer
of one famous speech from one scene to another. When Hamlet is
talking quietly to the player king about how to act out his
father's death, the young prince, overcome with grief, suddenly
breaks down and delivers ``To be or not to be?'' It's an
interesting concept, particularly since the actor portraying the
player king, Per Myrberg, also plays the ghost of Hamlet's father.
   Bergman's production contains some startling imagery, much of it
designed by Goran Wassberg. His setting is simple _ a bare, black
stage, an arc of lights hanging above it and a circle, outlined in
red, placed on the floor at center stage.
   Wassberg's costumes are equally eye-catching, many of them in
shades of red and from different periods of fashion. The contrast
between the old and new underlines the uncertainty that plagues
this royal court.
   Pernilla Ostergren is a touching Ophelia, a child-woman who
remains on stage for much of evening, a forlorn witness to most of
the debauchery. Borje Ahlstedt is a randy, boozy Claudius while
Gunnel Lindblom as Gertrude matches him in every debauchery. Rarely
have these two royal misfits been so ably put on stage.
   The production is performed in Swedish, and the language
difference eventually poses a problem. For audiences familiar with
the English text, Bergman's interpretation of the story should be
readily accessible. But others with no knowledge of the play will
be lost. What's also missing from the production, at least for an
English-speaking audience, is the readily recognizable poetry.
   Still, there are Bergman's startling images of a world gone out
of control. The foreign language may cloud the text, but the
director's particular point of view shines through with a clarity
that makes this ``Hamlet'' a compelling and often haunting evening
of theater.

<HEAD>Law Minister Say BBC Representatives May Be Exprelled</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday
suggested it might order representatives of the British
Broadcasting Corp. to leave the country after the BBC aired a film
on children detained without charge in South Africa.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said a BBC spokesman phoned
his office Wednesday, asking for comment on allegations in the film
about torture of children during interrogation by police.
   Vlok said that when his spokesman, Leon Mellet, asked why the
comment had not been sought beforehand, the interviewer said,
``Quite frankly, the BBC does not believe the South African
government.''
   Vlok said, ``If this is the BBC's attitude, then why should the
South African government continue to host their representatives in
our country?''
   Vlok made his comments at a briefing to the President's Council,
an advisory body to President P.W. Botha.
   The South African government had appealed to the BBC for a
chance to view the film, ``Suffer the Children,'' before it was
broadcast Wednesday night. The BBC refused.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. reported
Thursday evening, ``There is a question mark over future BBC
representation in South Africa after the televising of a program
last night in which allegations were made about mistreatment of
minor children in detention in the country.''
   A spokesman for the BBC in London, who refused to be identified
in accordance with British custom, said, ``Naturally, the BBC
regrets any action which would impede our coverage from South
Africa.''
   The BBC said it commissioned the report from an independent
London-based company, Penumbra, which filmed inside South Africa
without government permission and without seeking police comment
because of emergency restrictions on the news media.
   Vlok also lashed out at members of the Detainees Parents Support
Committee, whose monthly reports on the numbers of people held
under emergency detention were widely quoted by local and foreign
news organizations as a reliable monitor during the past two years
of the national emergency.
   ``My warning to these people is: Stop it, or your wings will be
clipped,'' Vlok said. He did not elaborate.
   The government has refused, even in Parliament, to give detailed
information about the numbers of people held in detention, but has
frequently challenged the support committee to prove its figures,
based on interviews with families of missing people throughout the
country.
   In February, the support committee was one of 17 organizations
the government banned from all activity. Members of the group,
however, continued to make statements as individuals and one of
them, Max Coleman, has been engaged in a public debate with Vlok
for the past week about whether or not children under 16 remain in
detention.
   Vlok says 80 minors, none of them under 16, are now in detention.
   He accused the members of the support group of trying to
``destroy the morale, image and functions of the South African
security forces through its slanted, biased allegations and lies.

<HEAD>Cricket Captain Fired For Entertaining Woman in Hotel</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with two grafs to restore dropped first reference to
Gatting; picks up 3rd graf pvs: He remains...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British cricket player was fired Thursday as
captain of England's international team because he invited a women
to his hotel room, officials said.
   Michael Gatting, 31 and married with two children, ``behaved
irresponsibly during a test (international) match by inviting
female company to his room for a drink in the late evening,'' said
a statement by the Test and County Cricket Board, the game's
governing body.
   He remains as a batsman on the team.
   The board summoned Gatting to a hearing following allegations
Wednesday in the Sun that two of his players had sex with two women
on the lawn outside their hotel in Trent Bridge, near Nottingham,
the night before Monday's play and that Gatting himself reportedly
took a woman to his room for sex.
   The mass-circulation Sun and other newspapers identified the
woman as a 20-year-old barmaid and attributed the allegation about
Gatting to her.
   The incident was said to have happened after play during a
five-day match against the West Indies that ended in a draw Tuesday.
   Gatting denied allegations of sexual misconduct and vowed to sue
the newspapers, the cricket board's statement said.
   In any event, ``the invitation to Mike Gatting to captain the
England team ... has been withdrawn,'' the board said, using the
polite language that still prevails in the world of cricket.
   The second of the five matches against the West Indies begins
June 16 at Lords, the London ground regarded as the Mecca of
cricket.
   And it was to Lords that the England team selectors summoned
Gatting on Thursday.
   Allegations involving Gatting also appeared in the Sun, Today
and Daily Mirror.
   ``The selectors emphasized that they did not believe the
allegations in the newspapers and accepted Gatting's account of
what happened,'' the statement said.
   However, it added that team manager Micky Stewart was still
looking into the allegations, and a substitute captain would be
named Friday after Stewart reported to the selectors.
   Gatting, who refused to speak to reporters as he left, stepped
down from the team for the Lords match, according to the statement.
   ``Warnings had previously been issued to all England players
concerning the standard of behavior expected of them at all times,
both on and off the field, and these had been ignored,'' it said.
   Gatting has played for England 59 times and has captained the
team since June 1986.
   But although Gatting was decorated by Queen Elizabeth II for his
cricketing prowess, his captaincy has been lackluster. He won only
two of his 23 internationals as captain and last year he was
officially censured for having a foul-mouthed shouting match with a
Pakistani umpire during an international in Faisalabad.

<HEAD>American Woman Wounded In Ambush, Filipino Companion Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen wounded an American
woman and killed her Filipino companion in an ambush on the
outskirts of this southern city on Thursday, police said.
   In other developments, communist rebels stormed a Philippine
army post near the U.S.-run Subic Bay naval base and workers in
Manila prepared to exhume bodies from a mass grave believed to
contain victims of right-wing ``death squads.''
   Anne Theresa O'Neill, 57, a former Peace Corps volunteer, was
rushed to a hospital with wounds in the head and and other parts of
the body, while Fernando Blanco died at the scene, said police in
Zamboanga City.
   Blanco was the city's waterworks chief and an old friend of Miss
O'Neill, a native of Chicago.
   Police said Blanco was driving his car with Miss O'Neill beside
him to the city from the water reservoir at Pasonanca Park when a
car blocked their way. A gunman stepped out of the other car and
sprayed Blanco's car with automatic gunfire, police said.
   Staff at the Brent Hospital in Zamboanga, 540 miles southeast of
Manila, refused to disclose the nature of Miss O'Neill's injuries,
but the government's news agency reported doctors as saying she was
out of danger.
   The agency said Miss O'Neill suffered gunshot wounds in the face
and arms.
   Communist rebels aboard seven trucks stormed a Philippine army
post 20 miles east of the Subic Bay base Thursday evening, killing
seven troops and wounding two others, the military said Friday.
   Two rebels were killed and two soldiers were missing, the
military added.
   The guerrillas attacked a detachment of the army's 1st General
Headquarters Battalion in Orani, located on the Bataan peninsula
about 30 miles west of Manila.
   Officials said the rebels withdrew after the raid and pursuit
operations were under way Friday.
   The Bataan peninsula has become a stronghold of the rebel New
People's Army, which has been waging a 19-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.
   In Manila, more than 100 workers, relatives and human rights
activists prepared Friday to exhume bodies from a mass grave which
they said may contain victims of right-wing death squads.
   The church-backed Ecumenical Movement for Justice and Peace said
at least a dozen bodies were mysteriously buried in April in
unmarked graves in the South Cemetery of Manila.
   Movement officials obtained a court order authorizing exhumation
of the bodies to determine if they were members of the left-wing
Youth for Democracy and Nationalism who have been reported missing.
   Health officials said the exhumation was to begin later Friday.
   The wife of the cemetery caretaker told reporters Friday her
husband, Rogelio Royolada, 47, was missing since he left their home
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Opposition Says Hindus Harassed Because of Religious Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FARID HOSSAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition party leader Sheik Hasina
told 10,000 people at a rally on Thursday that Hindus were being
harassed following Parliament's passage of a measure that makes
Islam the state religion.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad was expected to sign the
legislation Saturday, said an opposition politician, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Hasina, leader of the Awami League, and Khaleda Zia, head of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, have sponsored a campaign to oust
Ershad since November. Ershad, a former general, first took power
in a bloodless coup in 1982.
   The two opposition leaders and a leftist alliance of five
smaller anti-government parties said earlier they will hold an
eight-hour national strike Sunday to protest the Islamic bill.
   Hasina told the rally Thursday, ``We have reports that Hindus in
southern Gopalganj District and non-Moslem tribals in different
parts of the country are being threatened that their land will be
taken away by force.''
   She did not say who made the threats. Gopalganj lies 55 miles
southwest of Dhaka. Most tribesmen in Bangladesh are Buddhist, but
some are Christian.
   She urged Bangladeshis to rise up against the law and added,
``Our protests against the Islamic law will continue.''
   The measure passed by Parliament on Tuesday amends the
constitution by inserting the sentence: ``The religion of the
republic is Islam, but other religions may be practiced in peace
and harmony.''
   Parliament passed the bill, 254-0, after 15 opposition lawmakers
walked out in protest. Ershad's Jatiya Party holds 252 seats in the
300-member assembly. All voted for the bill and were joined by two
independents.
   Not all assembly members were present.
   Opponents contend that fundamentalist Moslems may use the
amendment to try to impose Islamic strictures on Bangladesh,
including Koranic law.
   More than 85 percent of Bangladesh's 105 million people are
Moslems, but the state has been secular since its creation in 1971.
The minority groups are Hindu, Christian and Buddhist.
   Within minutes of the bill's passage, thousands of people took
to the streets of the capital in protest. At least 30 people were
injured and 35 cars and buses damaged during protests Tuesday and
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Solidarity Leader Applies for Passport for ILO Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said
Thursday he had applied for a passport to attend the annual
conference of the International Labor Organization in Geneva.
   The organization, an agency of the United Nations, groups
workers, employers and management representatives.
   ``I want to represent the working people who identify with
Solidarity,'' said Walesa, leader of the free trade union
federation that was outlawed after the 1981 imposition of martial
law in Poland.
   Speaking from his home, Walesa said he wrote the Foreign
Ministry asking for help in obtaining a business travel passport,
even though, ``I will represent a somewhat different point of view
than our government.''
   Government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz said Walesa, winner
of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, had not filed all the documents
required. He had no comment on Walesa's prospects for getting a
passport.
   The application comes a month after Walesa helped lead an
illegal strike at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk that ended without a
settlement May 10.
   All five workers in Poland's delegation to the International
Labor Organization conference belong to government-approved trade
unions, though one is a former Solidarity member.
   Two Western trade union groups _ the International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labor _
challenged the credentials of Poland's delegation because it does
not include any Solidarity members, the second year in a row they
have done this.
   Poland gave notice of its intention to withdraw from the
International Labor Organization in 1984 after being censured for
banning Solidarity, but it withdrew that notice last year.
   Poland regained full-fledged membership in the organization on
Wednesday after promising to repay $9 million in arrears.

<HEAD>Governor Orders Weekly Inspections At Rocket Fuel Oxidizer Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Richard Bryan said Thursday he has
ordered weekly state inspections when production resumes at the
only U.S. plant making a fuel component crucial for military
rockets and the space shuttle.
   Bryan said he will not try to block the resumption next week of
ammonium perchlorate production at the Kerr-McGee Corp. plant here.
   ``We are under the impression the fire department believes all
their concerns were met,'' Bryan said.
   The plant came under scrutiny after the only other U.S. plant
manufacturing the rocket fuel oxidizer was destroyed in a series of
explosions May 4 that killed two people and caused an estimated $73
million damage.
   Bryan ordered the state Division of Occupational Safety and
Health to begin inspecting the Kerr-McGee plant in unannounced
weekly visits. He also said he wants to work with federal officials
to minimize the plant's storage of ammonium perchlorate.
   Kerr-McGee officials said the company will resume production of
ammonium perchlorate Monday morning. The plant had been shut down
since May 12 after state officials threatened to sue the company
for creating a public hazard.
   Clark County Fire Chief Roy Parrish said Thursday he was
withholding approval on resumption of production until the district
attorney's office reviews a letter sent by Kerr-McGee that company
officials said answers the fire department's concerns.
   Anita Bridges, a Kerr-McGee spokeswoman, said the company hired
independent safety experts to inspect the plant and has ``done
everything humanly possible to try to alleviate the fears and
concerns of our operation.''
   The Kerr-McGee plant can make 36 million pounds a year of
ammonium perchlorate, the oxidizier used on space shuttle boosters
and military and civilian rockets. The destroyed Pacific
Engineering & Production Co. plant had the capacity to produce 20
million pounds per year.
   The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology was told in
a recent hearing that demand for ammonium perchlorate would rise
from 37.8 million pounds this year to more than 60 million pounds
in 1989.
   Each set of shuttle boosters uses 1.7 million pounds of ammonium
perchlorate, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
officials said Wednesday that the agency had eight booster rockets
on hand, enough for four flights.
   Richard Truly, chief of NASA's space flight program, said the
agency's schedule of nine missions next year might have to be
adjusted, depending on how long the shortage lasts.

   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh notified U.S. District

   The Senate voted 69-27 Thursday to choke off a
filibuster that has blocked action on a bill permitting the death
penalty for major drug dealers who kill police officers.
   The decision sets up a vote on the bill Friday that supporters
and opponents agreed probably would result in approval.
   ``This sends the message that we're not going to tolerate the
kind of warfare we're seeing on the streets of our cities,'' Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., chief author of the bill, told his
colleagues.
   But opponents such as Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., derided the
measure as an election-year attempt to appease public demands to do
something about illegal drugs. They also noted the death penalty
already exists in many states and it hasn't deterred drug pushers.

   The number of students bused for integration in

   Seattle is adopting a cluster school concept designed after one

from which parents have a ``controlled choice'' of schools.
   Michael Alves, a Massachusetts consultant who has worked on
similar efforts across the country, pronounced the plan
``first-rate'' after it was adopted unanimously Wednesday night by

   ``It will maintain desegregated schools, it should work in a way
that is fair, and I think it is constitutionally defensible,''
Alves said.

   75-5678@47 is quite comfortable at
Harvard University.
   For nearly six centuries, the wool doll fashioned in the form of
a weaver rested in a cool and dry Chanchay Indian crypt on the
central coast of Peru. It now bears a catalog number and sits on a
metal shelf in the climate controlled attic of the Peabody Museum
of Archaeology and Ethnology.
   Although the 2 million or so artifacts that fill the Peabody's
back rooms are rarely viewed by the public, museum curators from
around the world have become fascinated by the transformation of
the storage areas from musty chaos to a state-of-the-art sanctuary.
   ``This is the way it used to be,'' said assistant ethnology
collections manager Kathy Skelly, gesturing toward a rack of boxes
containing an unrelated assortment of relics. ``It was a mess.''
   The boxes, however, are the final link with the Peabody's
cluttered past.
   A nearly completed 10-year project to renovate and modernize the
museum's storage areas has led to precise and innovative
preservation tactics.
   Large artifacts are kept in rooms where temperature and humidity
are tailored to protect various materials. Small items are encased
in acid-free mounts, which allow researchers to view but not touch
objects. The tile floors are spotless. Motion alarms and sprinklers
hang from the ceilings.
   ``People have the impression that the back rooms of museums look
like their attics at home,'' said collections manager Una
MacDowell. ``That was somewhat true in the past, but I think what
you see at the Peabody will be the trend in the future.''
   In mid-October, about 30 curators and executives with the New
England Museum Association toured the Peabody's storage facilities.
Curators from around the world regularly inquire about its
preservation efforts, MacDowell added.
   ``I tell them the key in funding,'' she said.
   ``A lot of developing countries are interested in trying to
improve the way they store artifacts they see as an important part
of their national heritage,'' said MacDowell. ``It's just not
possible if you do not commit the funding.''
   The approximate $2.5 million upgrading of the Peabody's storage
rooms, funded by Harvard and the National Science Foundation, is
one of the most comprehensive efforts at artifact preservation,
said assistant director Rosemary Joyce.
   Joyce said similar programs have been sponsored at the
Smithsonian Institute in Washington, and the Bernice Bishop Museum
in Honolulu.
   In a building older than some of the objects it houses, the
problems of preservation were compounded at the Peabody, MacDowell
said.
   In the summer, the attic was stifling. Objects stored in the
basement levels were plunged into a chill throughout the winter,
she added.
   ``We finally achieved a stable environment for our collection
and that is very important,'' said MacDowell.
   ``Put it this way,'' said assistant archaeology collections
manager Susan Bruce, ``We're happy and the artifacts are happy.''
   Bruce led a team of experts which examined the Peabody's
collection of nearly 1,000 pre-Columbian Andean textiles. The
textiles, once stacked like the wares of a rug merchant, are now
layered between specially treated paper.
   ``Very few museums have anything close to this,'' she said.
``It's something that the public doesn't see, but it's a vital part
of what a museum should be about.''
   In a nearby room, with a climate modified for wood and leather
objects, Skelly walked up an aisle studying the collection.
   She passed Plains Indian feather headdresses and clubs from
South Pacific islands. Across the aisle, dozens of 85-year-old
Chinese figurines were arranged to depict a funeral procession.
   ``And here is one of our treasures,'' said Skelly, stopping at a
carved wood stool beaten by New Guinea tribal leaders during
important decrees.
   MacDowell later banged on a metal table top.
   ``We're finally moving into the 20th century,'' she said. ``It's
exciting.''

<HEAD>`20-20' Celebrates Once Unlikely 10th Anniversary; Cronkite `At
Large'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This time last year, the odds that ABC's
``20-20'' would celebrate its 10th anniversary, as it does tonight
with a two-hour retrospective, seemed about 50-50.
   When ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard announced he
was moving ``20-20'' from its long-time Thursday time period to
Friday, many people, including ``20-20'' co-host Hugh Downs,
complained loudly.
   ``I finally called (ABC President) John Sias a few weeks after
we went on, and I said, `I feel apologetic about all the public
moaning I was doing about the `dumb' move to Friday,''' Downs said
in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he was attending
the network affiliates' meeting.
   ``I'm very pleased that it came out all right, but it may be
that I'm not off base to think it's a tribute to the strength of
the show to virtually break tradition. People don't usually cross
calendar lines to follow a show that they like, and, by George!
people did.''
   ``20-20'' held its own in the ratings, finishing the season a
respectable 49th out of 85 regularly scheduled programs.
   Downs, who recently celebrated 40 years in the business, and
co-host Barbara Walters are no doubt a big reason for the show's
following. A proven team, they were paired years ago as co-hosts on
NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``A major, major, major reason for the success of `20-20' is
Hugh and Barbara,'' said executive producer Victor Neufeld. ``I
think they have developed over the years one of the best-liked and
well-respected hosting teams in television. The chemistry is
perfect.
   ``Here's Barbara, the high-powered, major worldwide broadcasting
entity-slash-interviewer, sitting next to Hugh Downs, a gentleman,
an easy-going, respected but well-liked individual who is perfect
counter.''
   Other correspondents have included Silvia Chase and Geraldo
Rivera, who are no longer with the show, Tom Jarriel, Bob Brown,
John Stossel, Lynn Sherr and Stone Phillips. All are featured in
the retrospective.
   ``We work very hard at the concept of being close to our
viewers,'' said Neufeld. ``We do pieces that reflect what we think
is ... of interest around the country. We are not into ourselves
and do stories we think we want to do.''
   Although at the time Stoddard said he was confident the
``20-20'' audience would follow it to Fridays, he did assure
concerned television critics and viewers that the program would get
a new time rather than be canceled if its ratings dropped.
   Now, says Downs with a laugh, ``I'm content if they leave it on
Friday. I wouldn't want to move back to Thursday, in other words.''

   CRONKITE AT LARGE _ Walter Cronkite, who hopes to carve out some
additional air time in his contract renegotiations with CBS, gets
his first prime-time exposure of 1988 on Saturday with ``Walter
Cronkite at Large.''
   Cronkite, in a recent interview, declined to comment on the
negotiations, only to say, ``I think both sides are hopeful we can
come to a happy relationship again to continue the 38 years of my
association with the company. I can't characterize the negotiations
at the moment _ `open and continuing.'''
   Cronkite, the long-time anchor of the ``CBS Evening News,''
stepped down in 1981 and was succeeded by Dan Rather. Since then he
has been a special correspondent, anchoring irregularly scheduled
specials.
   Under Cronkite's contract, negotiated in 1980, his annual salary
drops from approximately $1 million to $150,000 when he turns 72 in
November, and he becomes a consultant rather than correspondent.
After Cronkite suggested publicly that he would be free to work on
other networks, CBS began negotiating to keep the symbol of CBS
News at CBS.
   Cronkite said he wouldn't mind continuing to do the ``At Large''
series, which allows him to travel widely doing stories of personal
interest.
   Saturday's edition features an update on the predictions of 20
years ago that the environment would be ruined by now without
protection; a report on Macau, a gambling center that will become
in a few years the property of distinctly anti-gambling communist
China, and a travelogue on hot-air ballooning in France.
   ``It's kind of an ideal program to do. Whether that's the exact
format of future programming I might do, I just don't know,''
Cronkite said. ``I think that's something for us to examine when we
kind of come to a decision what our relationship is.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   MAGNUM ENSHRINED _ Thomas Magnum's Detroit Tigers cap and
Hawaiian shirt will be donated to the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History in a ceremony June 22.
``Magnum, P.I.'' recently ended an eight-year run on CBS. The
Tigers cap, a tip of the hat to star Tom Selleck's hometown, and
the Hawaiian shirt were trademarks of the private eye, as was his
military cap from Vietnam. Museum curator Charlie McGovern said,
according to ``Magnum'' publicists, that the items were of special
interest to the museum because ``Magnum'' was the first television
show to deal with life after Vietnam for veterans.

   Bertha Shefton closed her eyes and
shuddered as she relived the moment.
   The 80-year-old widow owed $103.44 on her water bill, and city
utility truck No. 986 had just arrived at her small, white stucco
bungalow to cut off the water.
   Doing without water would be hard enough for a frail old woman
in the suffocating subtropical heat and humidity of south Florida,
but Mrs. Shefton also cares for a granddaughter who has lost her
left leg to diabetes and must undergo kidney dialysis three times a
week.
   ``I tried to explain that somebody had stolen my Social Security
check and that I'd pay the bill as soon as my next check came in,''
Mrs. Shefton told a visiting reporter. ``They told me they were
only doing their job.
   ``It was plain to see those boys didn't want to do it. They said
they were real sorry, but it was still awful to watch them drive
away and know our water had been cut off.''
   But what the crew did next has made the four men local heroes
and brought in donations that should make Mrs. Shefton secure for a
long time: they drove back, turned the water on and scraped up
enough cash to pay her bill.
   ``When the word got out about what happened, a local plumbing
contractor volunteered to pay Mrs. Shefton's water bill for a year.
Another local company is paying her electric bills,'' said Benny
Scott, who supervises city water department crews.
   Scott and the three members of the city's celebrated utility
crew _ Joe Johnson, Mark Craddock and Lyn Roberts _ visited Mrs.
Shefton one recent steamy afternoon. They stopped by to say hello
and see how she was faring.
   ``These are my friends,'' Mrs. Shefton said, giving Scott a hug.
``These fellows are my heroes, they're the ones who started the
wheels turning for me.''
   The wheels began turning Mrs. Shefton's way almost immediately
after the utility truck pulled away from the curb in front of her
house on April 14.
   ``We decided we just couldn't leave her like that,'' Johnson
said. ``It was the middle of the month, and that meant it would be
more than two weeks before the old lady's next check would arrive.
It was plain that she and her granddaughter really needed help.''
   Cutting off water service in such a climate makes people
desperate, the crew members said.
   ``Some of them get real nasty and threaten to shoot you or sic
their dogs on you,'' said Roberts. ``Others get down and beg you
not to do it, which only makes it worse.''
   Mrs. Shefton had merely asked for enough time to fill her
bathtub and a few pots and pans with water before service was shut
off.
   ``It really touched me,'' Johnson said.
   So the crew members called their office on the truck radio and
found out how much Mrs. Shefton owed. Then they began pulling money
out of their pockets.
   ``Joe and I each put up $15 and Willie Hargrett, our foreman,
pitched in $20,'' Roberts said. ``Some other fellows at the office
also contributed a few dollars, and Benny Scott put up the
remaining $33.44.''
   Craddock put in a dollar.
   ``But that was every penny he had,'' said Roberts. ``It was a
gift from his heart.''
   News media soon picked up the story.
   ``Since then we've gotten dozens of calls and letters from all
over the place,'' Scott said. ``People from as far away as
California have sent money and checks for Mrs. Shefton; a local guy
even stopped by and gave us a check for the $103.44 we had put up.''
   Scott said he has turned over all the contributions, including
the $103.44 check, to Mrs. Shefton's church, where a fund has been
set up for her.
   ``So far, we've received more than $700,'' the Rev. Otis Sample,
pastor of the Mt. Calvary Baptist Church, said recently. ``We'll
use the money to help her pay her bills.''
   Mrs. Shefton lost her husband, Izell, a year ago, and she and
her granddaughter, Mercideen Pugh, 37, live on a monthly income of
$952.
   Mrs. Shefton, a former domestic worker who cleaned the homes of
Pompano Beach's more affluent families for 40 years, said she
doesn't know what to make of all the help and support she has
received.
   ``It's wonderful, but don't forget that it all started with
these boys here,'' she said, pointing to Johnson, Roberts, Craddock
and Scott.
   ``We were happy to do it,'' replied Scott, who said he, too, is
somewhat flabbergasted by all the attention, including letters of
commendation from the mayor.
   ``We didn't have no idea it would turn out like this,'' he said.
``We were just trying to help a nice old lady out of a jam.''

<HEAD>Censorship by the Gun? 25 Journalists Listed as Killed in Mexico</HEAD>

   Journalism groups say gunmen and
assassins have killed 25 Mexican journalists in the past six years
in what may be a concerted effort to intimidate reporters
investigating drug trafficking or critical of political figures.
   The groups, consisting of journalists' unions, newspaper
publishers and writers, are demanding the government of President
Miguel de la Madrid take more forceful action to stop those trying
to censor them, not by official blue pencil but by the gun.
   The number of killings are said to have risen along with an
increase of drug trafficking through Mexico. In the 12 years
previous to 1982, 18 journalists were killed compared with the 25
listed by the journalism groups as having been killed in the past
six years.
   De la Madrid responded to the journalists' complaints June 7,
Mexico's Freedom of the Press Day, that his government is
determined to find out the killers and bring them to justice.
   His Interior Department in Mexico City, however, disputes the
journalists' claim that 25 colleagues have been killed. It said in
a report it investigated 24 cases _ a 25th is in the hands of the
attorney general _ and found 15 professional journalists were slain
and that four others had ``marginal, incidental or occasional''
employment in the field. The remaining five, it said, were had no
connection with the profession.
   The journalism groups, however, hold to their list of 25.
   Alejandro Junco, publisher of the newspaper El Norte in the
northern city of Monterrey, said the report's conclusions are
``overly optimistic. They're trying to prove a point, and there's
some truth to what they say but not all truth.
   ``But I would rather be overly concerned than have a false sense
of security.''
   Junco also is president of the Mexican press freedom committee
of the Inter-American Press Association.
   The most recent journalist homicide was the shooting April 20 in
this northwestern border city of Hector Felix Miranda, columnist
and co-director of the outspoken weekly Zeta, who often wrote about
politics.
   An automobile overtook Felix Miranda, known as ``Felix the
Cat,'' as he drove to his office that morning. A man stepped out of
the car and fired three shots from a 12-gauge shotgun.
   The Federal Judicial Police arrested Victoriano Medina on May 1
and charged him with murder, but they said he may have been acting
for others.
   Many of the columnist's colleagues question whether any others
who may be responsible ever will be brought to justice.
   Among the allegations circulating are that high-ranking
politicians who were satirized or criticized in Felix Miranda's
columns might have been involved.
   ``We don't dismiss that possibility,'' said Jesus Blancornelas,
the co-director with Felix Miranda of the Tijuana weekly.
   Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, a human-rights activist and
presidential candidate for the small Revolutionary Workers Party,
recently voiced concern about what she called the alarming rate at
which journalists have been ``threatened, suppressed and
assassinated.''
   ``We must protest for the journalists who have been silenced,''
she told reporters at a news conference. ``You form part of the
consciousness of the people of Mexico.''
   Freedom House, a New York-based human rights monitoring group,
said in its latest ``Freedom in the World'' report that the Mexican
press operated under constant threat of intimidation.
   Of at least 19 journalists killed throughout the world in 1986
in Freedom House's reports, four were from Mexico _ more than from
any other country.
   ``The problem is worse in Mexico than any other Latin American
country,'' said Junco, the Monterrey publisher who also is
president of the Mexican press freedom committee of the
Inter-American Press Association.
   ``This is very alarming because the rate of increase in
journalist murders is phenomenal,'' he added in an interview.
   The Interior Department report said available evidence indicates
that of the 15 professionals killed, seven of the cases lead to the
``presumptions that the deaths are not tied to journalistic work.''
It added that three were journalists ``whose death is presumably
linked with drug trafficking'' and five were killed for ``reasons
presumably linked to journalistic activity.''
   Junco challenged the department's claim that three journalists
were involved in drug-trafficking.
   ``I just don't buy the argument that people were involved with
drugs and that's why they were killed,'' he said.
   ``Maybe some were moonlighters or part-timers, but they were not
killed because of their other jobs.''

   Said Fernando Pineda, president of the liberal Union of
Democratic Journalists: ``The problem is that there are 25 dead
journalists. One never knows the motivation. Even if they were
killed for other reasons, the investigations and clarifications
should be concluded.
   ``We don't know if they were killed for some story they wrote or
for some other situation.''
   But he added that any unsolved cases leads to a general climate
of insecurity that makes ``journalism in Mexico a very high risk
profession.''
   Junco said he believes reportage on the increase in illegal drug
trafficking from the Florida area to the southwestern United States
via Mexico _ and the subsequent criticism in the Mexican media of
drug trafficking _ is partly the reason for the increase in
killings. He is not alone in that belief.
   Elena Poniatowska, one of Mexico's more prominent writers, said
that the journalists' deaths in northern Mexico in particular
generally appear to be related to the drug trade's rise.
   Speaking at a conference on Cultural Conflict and Literature,
she said she was not accusing the government of the deaths, ``but
the omission becomes complicity by not punishing the guilty.''
   The government has offered rewards for information about the
killings of several journalists, including that of the influential
columnist Manuel Buendia of Excelsior, a major newspaper in Mexico
City.
   He was shot to death May 30, 1984, in Mexico City's Zona Rosa
(Pink Zone) business and entertainment district.
   Buendia, whose column ``Private Network'' appeared on
Excelsior's front page, was regarded as a hard-hitting
investigative reporter who covered a wide range of subjects,
including politics and international affairs. He was the author of
the book ``The CIA in Mexico'' and wrote often of his opposition to
U.S. involvement in Central America.
   The federal investigator assigned to the case issued a report on
the fourth anniversary of the slaying saying authorities had
whittled down the number of possible ``intellectual authors'' _
people who could be behind the killing _ to 41, and of those
suspected of actually carrying it out to 10.
   He concluded that the chance for a resolution of the case is
only modest.
   The federal attorney general's office, under pressure from
reporters and civic groups, recently offered a reward of 500
million pesos _ close to $215,000 _ for information leading to the
arrest of those responsible for Buendia's killing.
   Another victim was Manuel Burgueno Orduno, who wrote frequently
about drug trafficking in the northwestern coastal state of
Sinaloa. He was shot and killed in his home there Feb. 22 by three
men who entered his house as he and his family mourned the death of
his father. The assailants escaped.
   Sinaloa is a notorious center for the illegal drug trade, and
related violence has prompted general concern among residents.
   The Sinaloa Journalists Association stages demonstrations
outside the attorney general's office in Culiacan, the state
capital, on the 22nd of every month to protest the slaying.
   Alejandro Sicairos Rivas, president of the association, said 10
reporters, most if not all of whom also wrote about drug
trafficking, have been killed in Sinaloa in the past decade.
   Sicairos, news editor for the daily Culiacan newspaper Debate,
said police have told him they have tried to solve the murders.
   ``They told us that the murder of journalists is very
complicated, that they possibly are very well-planned,'' he said.
   He added, ``It's not possible to sit at our typewriters and have
the ghost of death looking over our shoulders.''
   At the Freedom of the Press Day ceremonies, Christina Pacheco, a
columnist for La Jornada of Mexico City, told President de la
Madrid:
   ``Manuel Buendia was killed four years ago now. Hector Felix in
Tijuana and Manuel Burgueno Orduno in Culiacan were killed a very
short while ago.
   ``And between them there are the bodies of other journalists,
men and women, that also and with the same urgency wait for
justice.''

   At the end, she was alone, hiding from the
world she'd shattered that day in wild gunfire. Outside, the tears
and trauma had just begun. Inside, Laurie Dann shot one last time
and her torment was over.
   No one saw her place the .32-caliber revolver in her mouth or
heard the shot that destroyed her demons and ended a day of terror.
   Three weeks after she killed a young boy at Hubbard Woods
Elementary School and ended her life in the house where she had
held police at bay, authorities are still trying to piece together
the puzzle of Laurie Dann's life.
   ``We want to answer the question why,'' said Winnetka Police Lt.
Joseph Sumner. ``What made it happen? How did it happen? We owe
that to the citizens and the community. We owe it to the families
of victims. If you put yourself in their spot, you'd want to know
why.
   ``It's very possible she may have taken that to the grave with
her,'' he added. ``We can hopefully come down with a position of
`This is probably why.'
   Laurie Dann's road to tragedy was lined with signs of trouble
ahead, most posted in the last two years.
   In that time, she was divorced, forced out of an apartment and
charged with shoplifting. She lied about her name, age and
occupation; she claimed to be a teacher or a journalism student.
   She was suspected of making hundreds of harassing hang-up or
threatening phone calls to her ex-husband, his family and others.
She was charged once, but the case was dropped due to insufficient
evidence.
   Students and officials at two schools say she hid raw meat under
seat cushions, wore knit gloves when she ate, ran her shower for
hours and rode an elevator day and night in her dormitory where she
was called ``psycho'' and ``elevator lady.''
   ``She was definitely a very, very confused woman,'' Sumner said.
   Dangerous, too, her ex-husband and others feared. But even as
they were contacting the FBI, prosecutors and police, several North
Shore families were unwittingly hiring Dann as a babysitter.
   Two days before the May 20 tragedy, Arizona prosecutors were
ready to charge Dann with making threatening phone calls to a
former boyfriend. Illinois authorities were working a similar case.
The FBI was closing in, too.
   They moved too late. By then, Dann had killed 8-year-old
Nicholas Corwin. She shot five other children at the school and a
20-year-old man who tried to disarm her when she burst into his
family's house. She barricaded herself there and committed suicide.
   ``I don't see why this had to happen and get this far,'' Susan
Taylor, her former sister-in law, said on ABC's ``Nightline.''
Taylor said Dann called her hundreds of times,saying things like
```Susie, Susie, Susie, you are going to die.'''
   Dann, police say, left behind a trail of poison: 31 packets of
juice and other foods, 29 of them contaminated with arsenic or
lead, sent to her ex-husband, psychiatrist, families she worked
for, two Northwestern University fraternity houses and others.
   Police believe she may once have known someone at the frat
houses but don't know why she directed her poison at acquaintances,
her gun at strangers.
   It wasn't the only paradox in Dann's life.
   Children she tended adored her, but adults came to fear her.
   She was raised in a world of wealth and elegant homes, but she
left rotting meat behind in one apartment with urine-stained floors.
   Still, some say they detected no hint of growing fury.
   ``She really was a pleasant ... quiet person. ... She wasn't
this ghoulish person all her life,'' said Peter Solber, one
attorney who represented her in divorce proceedings. ``She wasn't
the monster she turned out to be.''
   For most of her 30 years, Laurie Dann lived an unremarkable life.
   Laurie Wasserman, who had an older brother, Mark, graduated from
prestigious New Trier East High School. Her father, a successful
accountant, and mother live in Glencoe on the North Shore, where
$500,000 mansions, private beaches along Lake Michigan and
three-car garages are not uncommon.
   In high school ``she was really quiet, kind of withdrawn. She
held her head low,'' said ex-classmate Margie Guiarelli. ``There
was always kind of a wall in-between. ... She never really gave you
eye contact. She was nervous when she talked to you.''
   She took classes at four universities _ Drake, Arizona,
Northwestern and Wisconsin-Madison _ over six years. At Arizona,
she majored in home economics but did not graduate after four
years. Later, she took courses in acting, dance and playwriting.
   At Arizona, Dann pledged Alpha Delta Pi sorority, where sisters
remembered her as introverted and recalled how she would make
several dates for one night, then cancel all but one.
   ``I just perceived her to be a sweet little girl,'' Denise
Shimer Janes, a former chapter president, told The Arizona Star.
   For two years, Dann dated a premed student at Arizona, who later
claimed she harassed him with threatening phone calls. His identity
has not been made public.
   However, the man's friend, Louis Spivack, an Arizona prosecutor
who double-dated with them, remembers Dann as ``aloof, perhaps a
little unfriendly, possessive'' but exhibiting no especially
strange behavior.
   In 1982, two years after returning to the Chicago area, she
married Russell Dann, who worked in his family's insurance firm.
   Solber said his client, who was 5-foot-3, described herself and
her husband as both ``little and cute. (She said) they looked like
brother and sister. That was her perception.''
   The Danns bought a $275,000 home, but the marriage crumbled by
1986. She saw a psychiatrist for part of their marriage.
   Their parting was bitter. Dann, who had taken a marksmanship
course in her college days, bought a .357-caliber Magnum, saying
she needed it for protection. A worried Russell Dann alerted
police, who contacted her parents. Wasserman told officers the gun
would be locked in a safety deposit box.
   The .357 was one of three guns she carried into the school.
   Dann also accused her husband of assault, breaking into their
home and setting it on fire, charges never substantiated.
   Russell Dann, in turn, asserted she sneaked into his apartment
as he slept Sept. 30, 1986, and stabbed him in the chest with an
ice pick. He said he never saw his assailant and later claimed his
ex-wife had admitted to the attack.
   But Russell failed a lie detector test and refused to take a
second, while Laurie passed, said Michael Waller, assistant Lake
County state's attorney.

   Police found packaging for an ice pick in the house the Danns
had shared, but Waller said no fingerprints were on the pick
itself. Waller also said reports indicated the doctor and nurse who
treated Russell at the hospital noted the wound could have been
self-inflicted.
   No charges were filed. ``There was just no case there,'' Waller
said.
   According to divorce records, Dann was to receive a lump sum of
$125,000 and $1,250 monthly for three years.
   After the shootings, Russell Dann appeared on ``Nightline'' at
his request and phoned a radio talk show to urge tougher gun
control. Since then, he has declined further comment.
   He did acknowledge to The Associated Press, however, that ``some
people think I was the bad guy.''
   Laurie Dann's life began unraveling faster and faster in 1986.
   That summer, she dated John Childs, whose mother, Alexandra,
lived near her parents. She was ``very pretty ... very preppy ...
but very shy,'' Mrs. Childs said, and had unusual habits: she
washed her hands often and touched things only with a napkin.
   She said her son ``noticed too many problems. ... She'd be very
friendly, then it would be, `Don't touch me, don't touch me.'''
   That fall, Spivack said his friend, now a doctor, began getting
harassing calls he believed were from Dann _ six years after their
breakup.
   Spivack said Dann somehow obtained the doctor's unlisted number;
the FBI said she knew where the doctor was working. Spivack said
the calls stopped in 1987 after an attorney wrote a letter to her
parents' home.
   Last summer, Dann's father intervened when Northwestern
University officials, reacting to repeated harassment complaints,
including reports she left raw meat under lounge cushions, moved to
evict her. She left the graduate student apartment she was
subletting.
   Dann then posted notices in local groceries, seeking babysitting
jobs. Many families said she had a terrific rapport with children,
but Wasserman twice made restitution to employer families after his
daughter was suspected of stealing food or clothes, police say.
   In January, Dann moved to The Towers in Madison, Wis., a
dormitory one block off the University of Wisconsin campus. Most
residents were freshmen, more than a decade younger than Dann.
   Her suitemate said Dann told her she was a journalism student
from Northwestern, but she never carried books or attended classes.
Dann explained to dorm neighbors she wore gloves when she ate
because she was allergic or sensitive to metal objects.
   The suitemate, who asked not to be identified, said after
several incidents she became uncomfortable and moved out.
   Other residents say Dann avoided sidewalk cracks, watched TV all
day and rode the elevators for hours, carrying a note pad. Student
Brian Soifer said he heard she wept once when some guys teased her
on the elevator.
   ``Everybody told stories about her,'' he said. ``She must have
known people were pointing at her and talking about her.''
   ``She just looked like she was lost,'' said resident Scott
Tzinberg.
   Amid mounting harassment complaints, meanwhile, the
investigations continued.
   Waller said December phone records showed that 55 pre-dawn calls
lasting a minute or less were made in 4{ hours from the Wasserman
home.
   In March, Dann reportedly stopped seeing her psychiatrist, who
had prescribed lithium carbonate to treat depression. She was also
taking an experimental drug called clomipramine, used for
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
   That month, a woman who had known the Danns when they were
married and had received hundreds of hang-up calls since 1986
picked up her phone to hear: `You are going to die.' The woman, who
asked that her name not be used, suspected Dann in all the calls.
   On March 14, Dann was arrested in Madison, accused of stealing
four wigs and other items, said Capt. Jeff Frye. He said Dann
initially gave police a fake name and a Michigan address. Once she
gave her real name, she still gave phony information on her student
status and address, he said.
   On May 9, Spivack said his friend answered the phone and heard a
female voice say ``she would come out and stab them and make it
look like his wife had done it.'' The FBI was given a
tape-recording of the call.
   The night of May 15, Frye said Dann was found in a dormitory
trash room curled in a fetal position, wrapped in a plastic bag and
dripping with sweat.
   When police arrived, however, she was asleep in her room. Aware
of the Arizona investigation, the FBI was called. They arrived the
next morning. She was gone.
   After the shooting, police searched her belongings and found a
picture of her with her ex-husband, scraps of paper with names,
rough drafts of threatening notes to the Arizona doctor, supportive
letters from her parents, four catalog cards from a library
referring to books on poisoning, a list of words including
``schools'' and ``both,'' and a white smock she apparently took
from a hospital where she'd been treated as an outpatient, said FBI
agent Kent Miller in Madison.
   Miller said Dann was suspected of stealing arsenic and other
chemicals from a hospital lab in March.
   Plans in Arizona to seek an indictment May 18 were delayed to
coordinate legal action with other states.
   Two days later, Laurie Dann, wearing a University of Arizona
Medical Center shirt with a skeleton on it, reached the end of her
road to tragedy.
   ``I feel very frustrated,'' Spivack said. ``We were within a few
days of averting this. We ran out of time.''

   Seven years after its discovery, AIDS
is still spreading rapidly around the world and researchers still
lack answers to some of the most perplexing questions about how the
virus causes disease.
   Beginning Sunday in Stockholm, 6,500 researchers from 125
countries will gather for the Fourth International Conference on
AIDS, the largest and most important of the hundreds of AIDS
research meetings held every year.
   The scientists are expected to make some 3,000 presentations of
fresh research on AIDS at the conference, which concludes June 16.
   ``I think what's going to be clear at this meeting is that all
the earlier ideas about the magnitude of the problem and the
potential dangers this poses to world health have been confirmed
over the past year,'' said William Haseltine, a molecular biologist
at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
   ``The earlier projections have, if anything, been
underestimated,'' he said. ``The notion of how the virus spreads
has been confirmed.''
   Its principal means of spreading remains through sexual contact,
hypodermic needles shared by drug abusers and unscreened transfused
blood. U.S. blood is screened for the presence of the virus.
   The sexual transmission of AIDS has been further clarified, he
said.
   ``We're beginning to understand the potential roots of sexual
transmission as mediated not by blood to blood but by
virus-infected cell to mucosal lining,'' Haseltine said. That is,
cells carrying the virus often gain entry to an uninfected person
through such mucosal linings as those in the vagina or the anus,
Haseltine said.
   At the time of the last international AIDS conference in
Washington in June 1987, reports on AIDS were appearing in
scientific journals at the rate of about 100 per week.
   That figure has climbed to 135 per week, according to the
Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia, and the trend
is continuing.
   The explosion of research has brought scientists closer to
understanding the life cycle and reproduction of the AIDS virus
but, unfortunately, not dramatically closer to a vaccine or a cure,
researchers said.
   ``I think the meeting will show substantial basic science and
clinical progress,'' said Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer
Institute, one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus.
   No breakthroughs are expected in the early trials of vaccines
that are now underway, Gallo said. In fact, he said he thought the
current vaccines _ generally consisting of a part of the AIDS
virus's outer coat _ will not trigger the kind of immune response
needed to prevent AIDS infection.
   ``I'm not enthusiastic,'' he said. Indeed, the human trials
should be considered only scientific experiments, he said, not
trials of potentially useful substances. ``The term vaccine should
not be being used,'' he said.
   ``Everybody now agrees that we face formidable problems with
vaccines,'' Haseltine said. ``It's a sober realization.
   ``This virus has evolved to evade our immune systems, and it
does so by hiding out, by coating itself with sugar and by changing
when necessary.''
   The vaccine trials have shown that people make antibodies to the
virus when injected with a fragment of the virus, but the
antibodies don't protect the subjects. ``The reason they don't is
that the viruses have evolved to live with humans a long time,''
said Haseltine.
   One recent study by a Japanese group led by Masanori Hayami
suggested that a progenitor of the AIDS virus might have infected
the common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans at least 20 million
years ago.
   Other studies suggest that the AIDS virus mutates very rapidly
and might not have infected humans until perhaps 100 years ago.
   On the treatment front, Dr. Martin Hirsch of the Massachusetts
General Hospital, a leader in the evaluation of potential anti-AIDS
drugs, said he foresees no dramatic advances.
   ``We've learned an enormous amount about the molecular biology
of the virus,'' he said. ``We know a lot less about how it causes
disease in humans.''
   That has made research difficult. Nevertheless, the development
in the laboratory of potential anti-AIDS drugs has moved very
quickly, Hirsch said. ``The progress in testing them has been more
difficult, because you have to do clinical trials evaluating each
drug.''
   Such clinical trials are becoming more difficult in part because
AIDS sufferers are obtaining experimental drugs illegally through a
network of guerrilla clinics. That makes it difficult for doctors
to be sure their subjects are free of drugs that might confound the
results of their experiments.
   ``I can understand the frustration, but it does make things more
difficult,'' he said.
   In an article published Thursday in Nature, a British scientific
journal, Dr. Jay Levy of the University of California, San
Francisco, identified four important and unresolved questions
surrounding AIDS:
   _ What determines whether infection will occur?
   _ How do different strains of the AIDS virus arise?
   _ How does the virus cause disease?
   _ And what determines the course of the infection?
   ``Concentration on these areas of research should provide
valuable information to help in the attack against HIV (the AIDS
virus),'' he wrote. ``In the process, we will learn a great deal
more about viruses and the function of the immune system.''

   Academy Award-winning actress Jane Fonda
cornered the home exercise market six years ago with the video
version of her best-selling book, ``Jane Fonda's Workout.'' As of
January, it has made $37.8 million.
   She has seven other exercise videos out, four in the Top 10
selling videocassettes, according to Billboard magazine. All are
released by Lorimar Home Video and have turned flab into fat city
for Fonda and friends.
   Fonda may be the home video exercise empress, but she's not the
only game in town.
   Also in the top selling exercise videos are MCA's
``Callanetics,'' Fox Hills' ``Kathy Smith's Winning Workout'' and
``Kathy Smith's Starting Workout,'' and JCI's ``Kathy Smith's
Ultimate Video Workout.''
   And ``The MS Workout,'' a new video produced by the New York
chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society features
exercises for people with multiple sclerosis and other neurological
problems.
   Led by dancer Wendy Amos and featuring MS victims including
Jimmie Heuga, the video is divided into three sections: a warm-up
of slow neck, back, leg and arm stretches; easy calisthenics; a
slow cool-down to relax the body.
   Some of the participants sit on chairs or stools while they
exercise. A ballet barre is handy for extra support.
   ``The program was designed with the assistance of an advisory
committee which was eager to see to it that the video was sensitive
to the broad spectrum of needs of ambulatory persons with MS and
other neurological diseases, and they selected exercises that
contribute to the improvement of balance and coordination,'' said
Carol Kurzig, executive director of the New York chapter.
   MS is a chronic, often crippling disease of the central nervous
system. Its symptoms can include numbness, sexual dysfunction,
difficulty with coordination, loss of balance and weakness.
   ``The MS Workout'' cost $15 and can be ordered from the New York
MS chapter.
   Fonda exercise tapes are available in most video retail outlets.
According to Lorimar they include ``Start Up With Jane Fonda,''
which was released in March and has sold 781,659 copies; ``Jane
Fonda's Low Impact Aerobic Workout,'' with $23.3 million in sales;
``Jane Fonda's New Workout,'' with $25.2 million in sales; ``Jane
Fonda's Easy Going Workout,'' $11.1 in sales; and ``Jane Fonda's
Workout With Weights,'' ``Jane Fonda's Pregnancy, Birth and
Recovery'' and ``Jane Fonda's Workout Challenge.''

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``The
Principal.''
   
   ``Fatal Attraction'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS, $89.95; Beat,
$29.95; Rated R)
   
   Consummate yuppie Dan Gallagher has it all: beautiful wife,
adorable daughter, upward mobility, Volvo station wagon. He's not
looking for a one-night stand, but when it presents itself in the
person of sultry publishing exec Alex Forrest, he can't resist.
   How could he know that under those tousled blond locks and
Maybelline eyes lurks the collective anger, frustration and
vengeance of every woman who has ever been done and dumped? Tsk,
tsk, Dan. Should've kept your pants on.
   Played with schizophrenic aplomb by Glenn Close, Alex answers
Dan's rejection with a series of cruel, creepy antics designed to
make your teeth hurt right up to the last second.
   Michael Douglas' Dan elicits little sympathy; there's a distinct
feeling he deserves some of what he's getting. Anne Archer as Dan's
wife is so sweetly unknowing that the audience actually ends up
feeling guilty on behalf of her adulterous, egocentric cad of a
husband.
   Director Adrian ``Flashdance'' Lyne knows how to create and
build tension: no surprise that this slick production was last
year's second-highest grossing movie.
   As the ``R'' rating indicates, there's a little too much sex,
flesh and violence for the kiddies. Otherwise, ``Fatal Attraction''
is a peach of a psychological thriller that could make even the
most dedicated couch potato squirm.

   ``The Principal'' (RCA@Columbia Home Video; VHS@Beta, $89.95;
Rated R)
   
   In ``The Principal,'' James Belushi plays a Rambo-like high
school teacher who drinks too much, smashes Porsches with baseball
bats and generally ticks off his bosses at the stuffy old board of
education.
   Instead of firing him, they decide to ``reward'' him with a
principalship. Trouble is, it's at Brandel High School, the
low-down dirtiest, most crime-infested, drug-ridden school on the
planet.
   The film misses no opportunity for gratuitous violence. The kids
don't just taunt or ignore him _ they beat him to a bloody pulp.
The teachers are assaulted. And in finest spaghetti Western
fashion, Belushi, riding his motorcycle into the very halls of
Brandel, is going to tame this here school, pard-ner.
   There is a climactic chase scene and showdown in the girl's
shower _ this film's ludicrous version of the OK Corral.
   Even a graduate of Brandel could predict the outcome of this
absurd, boring, exploitative movie.
   And even a better actor than Belushi could have done little with
such pea-brained dialogue as this sample when he tries to inspire
downtrodden teachers:
   ``Aw, come on, you people,'' says he, his voice rising
Patton-like. ``You can't pick and choose your students.''
   The film also features Louis Gossett, Jr., muttering
unintelligible cynicisms as the school's security guard.
   Tough schools lately seem to have caught Hollywood's fancy.
Unfortunately, it is only the rare film, such as the excellent
``Stand and Deliver,'' that manages not to succumb to sexploitation
or racist, blackboard jungle caricatures.
   ``The Principal,'' rated ``R,'' contains the foul,
street-language you'd expect in a film such as this. But not to
worry. The rest of the dialogue will probably put you to sleep.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
warned that a further decline of the dollar in foreign exchange
would not help improve the nation's trade deficit.
   Greenspan told a news briefing Wednesday at the International
Monetary Conference that the deterioration of the dollar ``will
augment the dollar-denominated U.S. trade deficit rather than
implement further progress.''
   Because U.S. manufacturers already are running at capacity or
near-capacity levels, further declines could not do anything to
help them sell more goods overseas or anywhere else, he said.

   Gasoline prices finished higher, but other oil
prices were little changed ahead of the upcoming OPEC meeting this
weekend.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for July delivery
of wholesale unleaded gasoline settled up 0.14 cent on Wednesday at
50.34 cents a gallon, but off from midday peaks.
   The near-term contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, fell 4 cents per 42-gallon barrel to finish
at $17.33.
   Among July contracts for refined products, wholesale heating oil
closed at 45.93 cents a gallon, off 0.30 cent.
   Analysts said reports of a fire at a major oil refinery, coupled
with an American Petroleum Institute report that showed
lower-than-expected gasoline production, worked to spark a strong
rally in the July and August contracts for unleaded gas.
   ``But it died in the afternoon as apathy in crude and weakness
in heating oil prevented gas from rallying too much,'' said Richard
Redoglia, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   He also noted that traders have no desire to take large
positions ahead of the regular mid-year meeting of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which opens Saturday in Vienna,
Austria.
   Trading ``was dead except for gas. Crude held in a narrow
range,'' he added.
   OPEC ministers are expected to focus on the cartel's production
quotas and price-support mechanisms.

   Takeover target Macmillan Inc. and Texas
billionaire Robert M. Bass will face off today in court, where a
judge will decide whether the publishing giant can proceed with a
controversial restructuring plan.
   Macmillan rejected Bass's latest $1.9 billion buyout offer on
Wednesday, saying its restructuring plan is more beneficial to
shareholders.
   At a hearing in Delaware Chancery Court set for this afternoon,
Bass attorneys will seek to halt a dividend payout, which marks the
first phase of the restructuring, on grounds that Macmillan
directors have breached their fiduciary duties by failing to get
the best price for shareholders.
   Macmillan attorney Dennis Block defended the plan as ``perfectly
appropriate'' and providing ``substantial value to shareholders at
this time and (giving) them continuing equity interest in the
future of the company.''
   The restructuring plan would split the company into two publicly
held entities and pay shareholders a special dividend of $52.35 a
share. The dividend is scheduled to be paid Friday, and Macmillan
stressed it is proceeding on schedule.
   The time limit is extremely tight, and both sides likely would
prefer the judge to rule from the bench.
   Robert Dunlap Jr., an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &
Co., said if Macmillan ``manages to pay the dividend on Friday, it
would appear management has won.''
   Attorneys close to the deal say it is likely the Bass request,
which has drawn support from the aggressive New York investment
firm Coniston Partners, will result in at least a temporary delay
in the payout.
   Coniston, which has accumulated a 4.9 percent stake in
Macmillan, filed an affidavit in support of Bass's effort to block
the dividend payout.
   ``We're interested in seeing a full auction for the company and
having it sold to the highest bidder,'' said Coniston principal
Augustus Oliver, who pegged Macmillan's value at between $85 to
$100 a share.
   He would not comment on whether the partnership might make its
own bid for Macmillan.
   But one source close to the battle speculated that Coniston ``is
in it for the money _ they don't want to buy the company,'' and
that the partnership's affidavit was merely an attempt to ensure it
gets ``fair value for its stock.''
   Bass has offered to acquire the company for $73 a share in cash,
or, alternatively, to restructure it in a similar fashion. But
Bass, who owns about 9.1 percent of Macmillan's roughly 26 million
outstanding shares, offered to pay shareholders a dividend of $58 a
share.
   Macmillan plans to separate into Macmillan Publishing Co. and
Macmillan Information Co. In addition to the dividend, shareholders
would receive for each Macmillan share a half-share of common stock
in Macmillan Information and $4.50 in principal amount of Macmillan
Information subordinated debentures.
   On Wall Street, Macmillan rose 62{ cents a share to close at $76
on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday.
   Coniston, fresh from its recent, unsuccessful proxy battle for
four seats on the board of Gillette Co., typically purchases a
large stake in a company and then pressures management to
restructure or take other action to boost its stock price.
   Macmillan has filed its own suit in federal District Court for
the Southern District of New York, charging Bass and his affiliates
with violating securities laws, repeatedly filing and disseminating
false information and engaging in a ``creeping tenders.''

<HEAD>Computers Aren't Enough _ U.S. Must Build Televisions, Companies
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States needs to build televisions,
not just computers, in order to remain a high-tech superpower into
the 21st century, some of the nation's technology giants say.
   International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and others
agreed this week that a strong consumer electronics industry is
critical to a strong technology base.
   The companies agreed Tuesday to form a task force to study how
U.S. companies can catch up to the Japanese in the next generation
of televisions _ electronics-crammed models that will produce
pictures nearly as sharp as magazine photos.
   At stake is a market that will grow to $40 billion a year
worldwide by the year 2010, as well as competence in a whole range
of related technologies, from speedy computer chips to advanced
signal processing.
   Zenith Electronics Corp. of Glenview, Ill., is the only
U.S.-based company still making televisions, and it lost money on
them last year.
   The announcement of the task force on high-definition television
is an acknowledgment of the damage the United States has suffered
by allowing its consumer electronics business to wither.
   ``They're finally learning what the Japanese have known for
years,'' said William Hassinger, assistant bureau chief for
engineering in the Mass Media Bureau of the Federal Communications
Commission. ``As the Japanese have found out, you can use consumer
electronics as a sort of economic engine to pull a train that has a
lot of other things in it.''
   The task force, created at a meeting in Santa Clara, Calif., of
the American Electronics Association, will be headed by Alexander
Stark, a senior vice president of AT&T, and Richard Elkus, chairman
of Santa Clara-based Prometrix Corp., a maker of semiconductor
production equipment.
   The task force is supposed to size up the situation and report
back in 30 days.
   Experts say consumer products ranging from compact disk players
to videocassette recorders have become so advanced that in some
respects they are more sophisticated than mainframe computers or
nuclear missiles.
   In fact, Japanese companies sell a large proportion of the
components for American weaponry even though they never set out to
create a military hardware industry. It was a spin-off from their
other product lines.
   Hassinger said the attempt to start up a television business
would be complicated by such things as the need to set up
dealerships, distributors, repair arrangements, advertising and a
base of customers.
   As for finding people to build them, he said, ``We have the
people here, but they're scattered around. It's hard to assemble a
well-coordinated design crew.''
   With enough effort, there is still time for the United States to
get into the market for advanced television.
   The televisions will start out at $2,500 or $3,500 when they
reach the market in the early 1990s, and even by roughly 2001 will
only capture about 1 percent of the world television market,
estimated John Hatch, a spokesman for the American Electronics
Association.
   After that, though, the market will take off, reaching $20
billion a year in the United States and $40 billion a year
worldwide by 2010, Hatch predicted.
   One of the critical issues in high-definition television is how
to set standards for the new technology. The standards that are
picked will affect how well the United States can compete with the
Japanese.
   Some U.S.-based companies are concerned that Japanese companies
could exert strong influence on the way standards are set in the
United States through their influence in the consumer electronics
group of the U.S.-based Electronic Industries Association.
   Zenith dropped out of the association last September,
complaining it was ``dominated by foreign concerns,'' but continues
to participate in its standard-setting efforts.
   But Mark Rosenker, the vice president for public affairs at the
Electronic Industries Association, said the organization is working
closely with other organizations such as the National Association
of Broadcasters and wants to create a standard that is acceptable

   ``If we don't have consensus, we could have a disaster on our
hands,'' Rosenker said.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Pan Am Plan to Sell Assets Shows Financial
Desperation</HEAD>

   Pan Am Corp. is in such desperate financial
straits that it was forced to take the drastic step of proposing to
sell the bulk of its assets, financial analysts say.
   The company said Wednesday that its board of directors had
authorized management to sell the assets if no agreement can be
reached on labor concessions with three holdout unions.
   Pan Am, the nation's eighth largest airline, also plans to
reduce its flight operations more than normal after the peak summer
travel season.
   ``It is a fact that Pan Am's (financial) condition is the worst
in the industry,'' said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc. ``There are some great risks
associated with this strategy, but (Pan Am) had no choice.''
   Among those risks, he said, are the possibility that potential
passengers could be scared away from Pan Am flights because of the
impending sales and that many frequent fliers on the airline could
stampede to cash in their travel awards.
   Pan Am had a net loss of $83.3 million in the first quarter and
is saddled with about $900 million in debt. The airline posted
staggering net losses of $265.3 million in 1987 and $462.8 million
in 1986.
   The two unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed
in January to wage cuts and work rule changes that are to save Pan
Am $240 million over three years, but analysts have estimated the
airline needs total savings of around $540 million over that period
to ensure its financial recovery.
   The flight attendants, Teamsters and transport workers unions,
on the other hand, have resisted taking pay cuts.
   In exchange for the concessions from the pilots and flight
engineers, Pan Am undertook a major management shakeup in January
in which the chairman and other top executives were replaced.
   The plan to sell assets was widely viewed as a last-ditch
attempt to pressure the three recalcitrant unions as well as a
measure of Pan Am's financial desperation.
   ``I don't think (Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett) had a lot
of choice,'' said John Pincavage, who follows the industry for
investment firm PaineWebber Inc. ``In many respects, it's a warning
shot.''
   Plaskett told airline employees about the asset sales in a
letter mailed Tuesday night.
   The board's decision authorized the sale of any of the assets of
Pan American World Airways, the company's main subsidiary,
``without limitation, including route segments and divisions,
maintenance and terminal facilities, aircraft, engines and other
equipment,'' Plaskett wrote.
   The only Pan Am assets that would not be considered for sale,
Plaskett said, are its profitable Northeast shuttle service and Pan
Am World Services, which provides ground services to other carriers
in airports around the world.
   If agreement was reached with the holdout unions, there is ``a
very good possibility'' that the assets might not be sold, Pan Am
spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said Wednesday.
   The company had no specific timetable for selling the assets,
she said.
   ``I'm taking the letter at face value; I presume that they're
serious'' about selling assets, said Margaret Brennan, the head of
the flight attendants union at Pan Am who also heads the Joint
Labor Council representing the five unions there.
   Brennan said the authorization to sell could be a tactic to
force the three unions into making concessions. She cautioned,
however, that ``I don't think they're going to accomplish anything
with (the flight attendants) like this.''
   William Genoese, director of the Teamsters union's Airline
Division, said he was considering calling a rally of his members to
protest the Pan Am move. ``They have to sit down with us,'' he said.
   The 4,500-member Teamsters union at Pan Am threatened a strike
against the carrier last winter and vowed ``guerrilla war'' tactics
including deliberate diversions of baggage.
   Plaskett said in his letter that as a first step in its new
plan, Pan Am will ``substantially reduce'' the level of its flight
operations in the fourth quarter, far beyond the normal seasonal
reduction following the summer peak.
   Pan Am also will close its flight service base in San Francisco
on Oct. 1, and will return two 747 aircraft to their lessors when
their leases expire at the end of the summer, he said.
   ``I am very disappointed that our inability to secure the cost
reductions we so desperately need to continue implementing our
growth plan has necessitated these and other planned actions,''
Plaskett wrote.

<HEAD>Audi Agrees To Settle Sudden Acceleration Class-Action Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of consumer groups say they will try to
persuade a judge to reject a proposed settlement of a class-action
lawsuit charging that the Audi 5000 sedans accelerated on their own.
   Under the proposed settlement, Audi of America Inc. would offer
rebates of $300 to $2,000 to 390,000 current or former owners of
Audi 5000 sedans with automatic transmissions _ if they buy a new
Audi between Sept. 1, 1988, and June 30, 1991.
   The deal applies to Audi 5000 sedans built between 1978 and 1986.
   As part of the settlement _ which is subject to approval of a
Cook County circuit judge _ Audi acknowledged no liability and
attorneys who sued the company admitted they couldn't prove that
any defect in Audi's cars caused sudden, unintended acceleration.
   The company, based in Troy, Mich., has been plagued by
allegations that its Audi 5000 vehicles sometimes accelerate on
their own, causing drivers to lose control. Similar allegations
have been leveled against other major automakers.
   ``We've said all along there is nothing wrong with our cars,
there is no defect causing unintended acceleration,'' Audi
spokesman Tom McDonald said Wednesday. `` ... I'd say it's a
victory.''
   But two consumer groups criticized the proposed settlement and
vowed to try to persuade Cook County Circuit Judge Harold Siegan to
reject it. Siegan has scheduled a public hearing July 26.
   ``I think it's grossly inadequate,'' said Clarence Ditlow of the
Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based group that is
investigating the problem of sudden acceleration in cars. ``If any
individual has had a sudden acceleration problem with an Audi car,
probably the last thing they want to do is get another Audi.''
   The center, founded by Ralph Nader, contends that at least 1,650
accidents have been linked to acceleration surges when the Audi
5000 was shifted from park into gear, causing 402 injuries and 5
deaths, said Jeff Schroeder, a vehicle safety investigator with the
group.
   The lawsuit, filed in March 1987, sought to compensate Audi
owners for a loss in re-sale value caused by an allegedly defective
automatic transmission.
   Settlement talks between the two sides began about six months
ago, said James Dupree, one of the attorneys who filed the
class-action lawsuit.
   ``In essence, Audi is using the court as part of a marketing
program,'' said Mark Steinbach, an attorney for the Audi Victims
Network, a group formed to pressure the government to investigate
the sudden acceleration problem.
   Under the proposed settlement, car owners would get cash
payments or rebates on a sliding scale depending on the model year
of the car they owned or leased and the date they buy a new Audi.
They would have until June 30, 1991, to buy a new Audi.
   For instance, the owner of a 1986 Audi 5000 who buys a new 1988
model of any type of Audi car before June 30, 1989, would receive a
$2,000 rebate that could either be taken in cash or applied toward
the purchase.
   Audis sell for a range of $18,000 to $35,000, McDonald said.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Declining Dollar Won't Help Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
says U.S. manufacturers are working so close to capacity that a
further decline of the dollar in foreign exchange would not help
them sell more goods overseas.
   The heads of the central banks of France and West Germany said
they agreed with Greenspan that they saw no benefit in further
depreciation of the dollar.
   The bankers' remarks, which came on the closing day of the 34th
annual International Monetary Conference, were cited for helping
the push the dollar higher against most major currencies on
Wednesday in foreign exchange trading.
   In New York, the dollar rose to 125.62 Japanese yen from 125.52
yen late Tuesday, for instance, and to 1.7261 West German marks
from 1.7113 marks.
   Speaking at a news media briefing at the close of the three-day
conference, Greenspan said the ``adjustment process'' by which the
dollar has depreciated over the past three years in an effort to
enhance the U.S. trade picture ``has made significant progress.''
   But, he said, ``the deterioration of the dollar will augment the
dollar-denominated U.S. trade deficit rather than implement further
progress.''
   Greenspan said that because U.S. manufacturers already are
running at capacity or near-capacity levels, further declines could
not do anything to help them sell more goods overseas or anywhere
else.
   Earlier, Greenspan and top central bankers from Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France and Mexico, discussed a variety of
economic concerns, including the U.S. federal budget deficit and
capital adequacy requirements for banks.
   The bankers refused to disclose specifics, but many, including
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl and Bank of France Governor
Jacques de Larosiere, agreed with Greenspan that they saw no
benefit in the dollar depreciating further. Poehl, however, noted
that the dollar's depreciation in the past had helped the West
German economy.
   Poehl assured reporters Wednesday that recent reported dollar
sales by the Bundesbank were not part of an effort to drive down
the U.S. currency and boost the West German mark, but rather a
routine effort to trim his country's dollar reserves.
   The dollar has lost half its value against such currencies as
the West German mark and Japanese yen over the past three years,
although for the last year its value has been fairly stable. It has
fallen less against the currencies of such major trading partners
as Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
   The stage was set for a drop in the dollar in September 1985,
when the United States and its four major trading partners agreed
to devalue the currency to help reduce the spiralng U.S. trade
shortall and stave off protectionist legislation. Last year,
however, that same group agreed that further decines in the
dollar's value would be ``counterproductive.''
   Although the dollar's depreciaton has failed to wipe out the
huge U.S. trade deficit, which set a record $171 billion last year,
there has been significant improvement recently. The deficit fell
to $9.7 billion in March _ its lowest level in three years _ on the
strength of U.S. exports.
   ``It (the trade improvement) is probably going at a pace about
as fast as one should want it to go,'' Greenspan said.
   To continue that momentum, he and other central bankers said
efforts should be made to reduce the huge U.S. budget deficit. The
bankers also reiterated the need to keep inflation down as a way to
continue economic growth worldwide.
   ``In order to continue the adjustment (of the trade imbalance)
in the long term, that is obviously a necessary condition,''
Greenspan said.

<HEAD>IRS Backs Off Plan to Tax Sick Leave Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is backing away
from a ruling that could have required immediate taxation of
accumulated vacation, sick leave and other benefits paid to
employees of state and local governments and tax-exempt
organizations.
   Although the IRS now says it never had any intention of taxing
such benefits, union leaders say the agency's clarification on
Wednesday could benefit more than 14 million workers.
   O. Donaldson Chapoton, assistant secretary of the treasury for
tax policy, said Wednesday that pending IRS regulations will spell
out that ``bona fide vacation leave, sick leave, compensatory time,
severance pay, disability pay and death benefits are not deferred
compensation subject to'' tax under Section 457 of the tax code.
   Chapoton outlined the government's position in a letter to Rep.
Ray McGrath, R-N.Y. McGrath, a member of the House Ways and Means
Committee, has been fighting an earlier IRS interpretation that
left open the door to taxation of certain employee benefits at the
time they were accrued, rather than when they were used.
   ``It was never the intention of Congress to allow the taxation
of bona fide employee benefits,'' McGrath told reporters in
releasing Chapoton's letter.
   The change, he said, ``signifies the fact that the IRS will not
be picking the pockets of these kinds of taxpaying employees.''
   The debate centers on a 1978 law that allowed employees of state
and local governments to take part in deferred-compensation
retirement plans. In 1986, Congress brought employees of
universities, non-profit hospitals and other tax-exempt
organizations under that law.
   The IRS traditionally considered immediately taxable only
``elective'' forms of deferred compensation, such as salary that a
worker voluntarily postponed receiving. ``Non-elective''
compensation, where there is no option to receive it immediately,
was taxed when received, rather than when it was earned.
   In 1987 the IRS issued a notice that was widely interpreted as
requiring immediate taxation of ``non-elective'' compensation and
extending that definition to such basic benefits as vacation and
sick pay. That set off an outcry by unions representing affected
workers and by several members of Congress.
   ``Under the IRS interpretation, many state and local governments
and tax-exempt employers would have to substantially restructure
their compensation and retirement arrangements to bring them into
compliance with the restrictions,'' said Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y., author of a bill to overturn the initial IRS position.
   He said the 1987 interpretation would have placed such employers
at a competitive disadvantage with private industry in keeping
employees.
   McGrath said he had enlisted the help of Vice President George
Bush in fighting the IRS interpretation.
   ``I called the vice president to explain the concerns of
millions of union members and elected officials from New York and
other states,'' McGrath said. ``He contacted Treasury Secretary
James Baker, who had the IRS reconsider its position.''
   Johnell Hunter, a spokesman for IRS, acknowledged the agency's
1987 ruling had caused confusion but said, ``We never intended to
tax that compensation in the first place.''
   The 1987 ruling, Ms. Hunter said, was ``to counter any abuse
that might take place with individuals who get deferred
compensation that is way out of synch with what it should be. ...
It was never intended to touch the ordinary worker.''

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. says the Securities
and Exchange Commission plans to file civil charges against the
investment firm, although the firm says it has done nothing wrong.
   Spokesman Steven Anreder said Wednesday that the ``SEC has
notified us that (it) has authorized its staff to file civil
action,'' but he would not comment on reports that the charges
include securities fraud.
   Reading from a prepared statement, Anreder said, ``While there
is no certainty as to when the SEC might actually file the charges,
we are eager to resolve this matter ....''
   The New York Times, in today's editions, reported that Drexel
chief executive Frederick H. Joseph told the firm's employees in a
memo that the SEC had authorized filing of charges of securities
law violations against Dreexel and four of its employees, whom he
did not identify.
   The employees involved are believed to be chief junk-bond dealer
Michael Milken, his brother Lowell and two people described as
traders, according to unidentified sources quoted in today's Wall
Street Journal.
   Joseph's memo also said the firm was prepared to negotiate a
resolution of the charges with the SEC even though he denied that
the firm or its employees had engaged in any wrongdoing, according
to the Times.
   The newspaper said the memo's emphasis was on Drexel's new
willingness to settle any charges. ``As a major financial
institution, we are aware of the benefits in getting this case
behind us,'' Joseph was quoted as saying.
   Drexel has been the subject of investigations by the SEC, the
U.S. attorney's office and a federal grand jury since the breaking
of the insider trading scandal surrounding former stock speculator
Ivan F. Boesky.
   Boesky, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud in April 1987, is
believed to have provided investigators with information related to
alleged wrongdoing by Drexel.
   Anreder said Drexel is eager to have the opportunity to confront
Boesky, who he described as ``a convicted felon and an admitted
liar,'' in a fair forum.
   Without Boesky, the ``principal source of the charges, there
would be no action,'' Anreder said. ``From the very beginning of
this investigation 18 months ago, we have stated that we are
unaware of any wrongdoing.''
   The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the SEC wanted to
hold off action to avoid interfering with the criminal
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York.
   The head of the SEC's enforcement division, Gary Lynch, and
officials at the office of Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan, both declined comment.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder also declined to comment on Drexel,
but he said Wednesday that he had requested more resources be
devoted to investigating securities law violations.
   ``We have urged the Justice Department to give increased
resources to the criminal investigation of securities law
violations,'' he told reporters during a break in an unrelated
congressional hearing.
   ``While there has been some increment in the resources of the
New York office, we think there could be more and we think there
could be more throughout the country,'' he said.
   Drexel acknowledged in February that it and some of its
employees had been targeted for civil charges by the SEC staff.
Milken, the best known Drexel executive, pioneered the market for
high-yield, high-risk bonds that have become a staple of Drexel's
business.
   During congressional hearings in April, Milken refused to
testify, confirming he was under investigation by a grand jury in
New York.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meetings among the oil ministers of six
Arab members of OPEC have failed to produce any agreement on
production quotas, delegation sources said Thursday.
   The meetings, taking place on the sidelines of a three-day Arab
summit, involve discussions between the two opposing wings of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The six oil ministers from Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates met in advance of the scheduled
June 11 meeting of OPEC in Vienna, hoping to resolve their
differences in informal talks.
   Algeria and Libya advocate production cuts while Saudi Arabia
and the Gulf emirates have defended their production levels. The
split between the two camps led to the failure of an April meeting
between OPEC and a number of non-OPEC oil exporters.
   The non-OPEC countries had offered to reduce their overall
output by 5 percent, or 183,000 barrels per day, on condition the
OPEC group made a matching 5 percent cut.
   The OPEC countries, which have a current overall production
ceiling of 15.06 million barrels per day, offered to match the
proposed non-OPEC cut barrel-per-barrel, but could not agree on an
overall 5 percent cut, which would have lowered their ceiling by
about 750,000 barrels per day.
   Indonesia's oil minister, Ginanjar Kartasasnita, earlier this
week called on the Arab OPEC members to resolve their differences
at the Algiers summit to help stabilize prices.
   The sources, participants in the talks who spoke on condition
they not be identifed, said the informal discussions in Algiers had
disclosed three factions among the Arab OPEC members.
   The Saudi-led group was demanding that current production levels
be left unchanged, while the Algeria group called for a sharp
production cut for the third quarter of 1988, with a possibility of
renewed increases in the fourth quarter to take account of higher
winter demand. A third group advocated simple alignment with world
prices and demand, the sources said.
   The sources said they doubted the differences would be resolved
before the Arab ministers traveled to Vienna next week.
   Iraq, which has refused to be bound by its OPEC-fixed production
ceiling, also took part in the talks, the sources said. Iraq has
demanded a production quota equal to that of its Gulf war enemy,
Iran.

<HEAD>Coleco Sale Of Some Outdoor Toy Lines Seen As Positive Sign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The purchase of a Coleco Industries
Inc. plant in upstate New York and two of its lines of outdoor toys
is another positive sign for the financially troubled toymaker, an
industry analyst said.
   SLM Action Sports Inc. of Morrisville, N.C., said Wednesday it
has bought the swimming pool and snow goods divisions of Coleco for
an undisclosed price. The deal included a 315,000-square-foot
factory in Mayfield, N.Y.
   The Coleco divisions, which SLM said had annual sales of $35
million in 1987, represent 45 percent of the domestic product lines
Coleco has offered for sale as it tries to raise cash to help it
avoid bankruptcy.
   Officials of West Hartford-based Coleco did not return telephone
calls for comment Wednesday.
   The company has yet to complete the sale of its remaining
outdoor toy lines including children's plastic playhouses, outdoor
furniturean batter-operated and ride-on cycles.
   However, Coleco said it had received offers for the lines.
   Paul Meyer, Coleco executive vice president for finance, said
the company hopes to complete that sale by the end of July.
   On Tuesday, Coleco denied a report published in the Hartford
Courant that it sold the lines of outdoor plastic toys to Hasbro
Inc. for an estimated $30 million.
   Coleco called the report premature, and Hasbro, of Pawtucket,
R.I., declined to comment. Analysts said they still expect Hasbro
to purchase the remaining outdoor toy products from Coleco, the
newspaper reported in today's editions.
   All of Coleco's outdoor toy lines, which helped launch Coleco in
the toy business in 1956, had sales last year of $77 million and
are made at plants in New York state.
   David Liebowitz, an analyst with American Securities Corp. in
New York, said SLM's purchase is another positive sign for Coleco.
   ``This transaction coming on the heels of further extension by
the banks and the agreement with one set of bondholders continues
the trend of positive developments,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Coleco announced it arranged short-term financing
through June 30 and reached an agreement with some of its debt
holders on restructuring its heavy debt load.
   However, Coleco still must complete restructuring of $335
million in long-term debt, arrange new sources of working capital
and rebuild from cuts in production and employment.
   SLM's statement said its purchase of Coleco's vacuum-formed
winter goods will ``compliment the existing injection-molded winter
line'' of SLM. SLM President William Fedyski said Coleco's ``Poly
Pools are already the best designed in the business. The challenge
will be to produce these goods at a profit in a time of escalating
resin costs.''
   A decision on the location of the acquired divisions is pending
cost analysis and discussions with state, local and union
officials, SLM said. SLM's products include such health and fitness
products and winter recreational products.
   Coleco, which lost $47.4 million in the first quarter of this
year, has been trying to cut costs and raise operating capital in
an efort to return to profitability.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, extending
the rally that has carried it close to its highest levels of the
year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.91 to 2,106.86 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 528 up, 479 down and 470
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 50.15 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   About 40 percent of that activity was concentrated in a single
issue _ Detroit Edison, which was unchanged at 14 amid a flurry of
large blocks keyed to the company's impending quarterly dividend.
   But otherwise, analysts said signs persisted of increased
enthusiasm for stocks among money managers at investing
institutions.
   Until late last month, fears of rising interest rates and
inflation prompted those professionals to keep large amounts of
their assets out of the stock market.
   But with interest-rate fears having cooled and stocks up sharply
in the past week and a half, analysts said money managers might
feel mounting pressure to make heavier commitments to stocks in
time for their midyear reports to clients.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor rose | to 52;
International Business Machines was unchanged at 116|; General
Electric slipped [ to 43{, and Coca-Cola was down [ at 38}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .28 to 153.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .55 at 306.78.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average 48.36 to 2,102.95,
coming up just short of its April 12 close of 2,110.08, which
marked a high since the market crash last October.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,289 up, 295 down and 393 unchanged. Big Board volume

<HEAD>Desert Partners Terminates Offer For USG</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desert Partners L.P., which recently lost a
proxy battle for six seats on USG Corp.'s board, on Thursday
formally terminated its $2.2 billion tender offer for the
Chicago-based building materials concern.
   Despite the move, Desert Partners, headed by Texas oilmen Cyril
Wagner, Jr. and Jack E. Brown, said it ``continues to believe that
it would be desirable for it to acquire control of USG.''
   The partnership had offered $42 a share in cash for up to 39
million of USG's 45.7 million common shares it did not already own.
Including debt securities, the deal carried a value of $2.2 billion.
   USG, which had resisted all takeover overtures, bounced back
with its own restructuring plan that includes paying shareholders
$37 a share in a cash dividend and notes valued at $5 per USG
share. The company estimated the plan will cost $2.2 billion.
   In a statement, Desert Partners said it will ``continue to
evaluate its ownership position and ... may at any time decide to
purchase additional shares.'' Conversely, the partnership also said
it might sell all or part of its stake.
   Last month USG shareholders backed the company's slate of
candidates by a 56-41 percent margin over those proposed by Desert
Partners.

<HEAD>Forecast: Big Three U.S. Production to Decline as Japanese
Transplants Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased U.S. production of Japanese
cars and nearly steady import levels will force the Big Three to
make fewer small cars and probably close some plants, a new
analysts' study shows.
   By 1990, overcrowding in the market will force General Motors
Corp. to close its Chevrolet Cavalier-Pontiac Sunbird plant in
Lordstown, Ohio, and Ford Motor Co. to close its Edison, N.J.,
Escort plant, according to the prediction Wednesday by the Wharton
Econometrics Forecasting Associates.
   GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. also will have to reduce production
of other small cars: Ford of the Tempo-Topaz; GM of the Chevrolet
Corsica-Beretta and the Pontiac Grand Am; and Chrysler of the
Omni-Horizon, the K-car and its replacement, which will be
introduced in 1989, and the LeBaron, the study predicted.
   The Big Three would replace their own small cars with cars
produced by their Japanese partners overseas and in U.S.
joint-venture assembly plants. All three already sell such cars
under their own nameplates. The cuts in Big Three production would
nearly equal the increase in output by Japanese-owned U.S. plants
by 1990, it said.
   The study, by analyst Edward Sullivan, does not show Japanese
automakers reducing exports to the United States as their U.S.
production increases _ despite the likelihood the dollar will
remain weak against the Japanese yen at least through 1993.
   ``We firmly believe that they brought those plants in here to
avoid protectionism and to increase their market share ... to
expand and penetrate the market,'' Sullivan said.
   Restrictions on Japanese imports to the United States in the
early 1980s and the Japanese government's voluntary continuation of
them since limited Japanese automakers to about 2.3 million car
exports to this country each year.
   By 1990, nearly every major Japanese automaker will have at
least one U.S. factory. Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. will
have two each. Production at Japanese-owned U.S. and Canadian
plants will double from 730,000 cars in 1987 to 1.4 million by
1990, Sullivan predicted.
   But Japanese imports will fall by only 100,000 units _ or a
reduction of 13 imports for every 100 U.S.-produced Japanese cars,
the study predicted.
   The result will be a 600,000-car overall increase in Japanese
sales in the United States and an increase in their share of the
U.S. market, Sullivan's figures showed.
   Since 1986, the value of the yen against the dollar has doubled.
But while the dollar is expected to fall further through 1993, the
decline will be much smaller than the plunge of 1986-1988.
Meanwhile, Japanese automakers already have adapted to the stronger
yen by cutting costs and improving efficiency.
   Because of this, Sullivan said, the Japanese face very little
price disadvantage against the Big Three and by 1990 would be able
to cut prices slightly.
   While Japanese imports will decline slightly, the study showed
imports from South Korea and other newly industrialized countries
increasing, boosting total car imports by about 50,000 in 1989
before a slight drop in 1990.
   The study predicts total 1988 U.S. car and light truck sales,
imported and domestic, at about 15.2 million, only slightly lower
than Big Three projections of 15.3 million, 1989 total sales at
14.7 million and 1990 sales at 14.1 million.
   ``We've hit our (sales) peak, we're coming down. The question is
how fast,'' Sullivan said.
   Light truck sales, which have grown steadily during the 1980s,
will be hit harder than car sales during a recession in 1989-1990,
Sullivan said, because the recession will cause a drop in business
investment.

<HEAD>Official Says Oil Deposits Should Be Developed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Top 6 grafs new with testimony; picks up 3rd graf pvs, The
announcement.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Interior Department official told a House
subcommittee today that the best way to preserve the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge is to authorize exploration and
development of its potentially rich oil deposits.
   ``The greatest risk to (the refuge) is to prevent exploration
and development in a sound and orderly way,'' said J. Steven
Griles, assistant interior secretary for land and mineral
management.
   Griles and other advocates of opening America's biggest wildlife
refuge to oil rigs said that the refuge could be hurt if a nation
faced another oil crisis that forced Congress into a crash program
to find new sources of domestic petroleum.
   He appeared before the House Interior Water and Power Resources
subcommittee, which is taking up the administration's controversial
refuge-drilling proposal as time is running out in the 100th
Congress.
   On Wednesday, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel announced that he
was shelving one of the more controversial aspects of the push to
open the refuge.
   Put on indefinite hold was the proposal to trade away
taxpayer-owned mineral rights on 166,000 acres of the refuge on
Alaska's north slope.
   The announcement was made by Interior Secretary Donald Hodel on
the eve of hearings by the House Interior water and power resources
subcommittee into the larger question of allowing drilling on the
refuge's 1.5 million-acre coastal plain.
   The Interior Committee is one of the final congressional
battlegrounds for the outgoing administration in its 18-month-old
struggle against the calendar and environment-conservation lobby
over the future of the refuge.
   Hodel said the plan to trade the mineral rights for 891,000
acres elsewhere in Alaska was being put on hold at least until
after Congress decides whether to open the refuge to petroleum
development.
   In a prepared statement, Hodel said he was indefinitely delaying
publication of a legislative environmental impact statement (LEIS)
on the trade, the necessary study document that would be used to
justify the deal.
   Hodel and other Interior officials have pushed the trade as a
way of acquiring valuable fish and wildlife property owned by
Aleut, Eskimo and other native corporations, which are anxious to
get in on the possible oil rush.
   ``From the start, it has been our position that Congress first
must approve legislation to allow oil and gas leasing in the ANWR
coastal plain and second must adopt legislation to ratify the
agreements before the proposed exchanges could take effect,'' Hodel
said.
   ``Therefore, I believe it would be premature to publish the
draft LEIS on the proposed exchanges until Congress clarifies its
intent on ANWR,'' said Hodel, who has gotten drilling legislation
approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources and the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries committees.
   Facing strong opposition from environmentalists and
conservationists, the administration and oil industry have argued
that the refuge offers the best hope of finding a new major source
of domestic petroleum.
   Bob Walker, an Interior Department spokesman, said the Fish and
Wildlife Service was ``right at the brink'' of issuing the
land-exchange LEIS when Hodel ordered the delay.
   ``The process is on hold and the LEIS is on the shelf,'' he said.
   Walker said the decision had nothing to do with a
soon-to-be-released assessment by the congressional General
Accounting Office that reportedly concludes the proposed trade is a
bad deal for taxpayers.
   He said the decision was made because ``we didn't want the land
trade muddying the waters on whether to develop the refuge. ... The
fear was, once we put out the LEIS, it would appear we were
bulldozing ahead.''

   The stock market churned around Wednesday's
closing levels today, bogging down near its highest levels of the
year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was unchanged at
2,102.95 as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 706 up, 539 down and
484 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 90.19 million shares at
midmorning.
   A large part of that activity was concentrated in a single issue
_ Detroit Edison, which was down [ at 13~ amid a flurry of large
blocks keyed to the company's impending quarterly dividend.
   But otherwise, analysts said signs persisted of increased
enthusiasm for stocks among money managers at investing
institutions.
   Until late last month, fears of rising interest rates and
inflation prompted those professionals to keep large amounts of
their assets out of the stock market.
   But with interest-rate fears having cooled and stocks up sharply
in the past week and a half, analysts said money managers might
feel mounting pressure to make heavier commitments to stocks in
time for their midyear reports to clients.
   Infinity Broadcasting jumped 8\ to 29} in the over-the-counter
market. A management group offered to acquire the company for $30 a
share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .05 to 152.92. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .88 at 307.11.

<HEAD>Reagan Wins On Veto But Senate's Trade War Rages On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following up on the Senate vote sustaining his
veto of a trade bill, President Reagan telephoned Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders today to urge prompt action on a
new bill to strengthen America's position in the global marketplace.
   The Senate fell five votes short Wednesday of the two-thirds
majority required to make the trade measure law despite Reagan's
objections.
   ``The will of the Senate was expressed yesterday in sustaining
the president's veto, and we are proceeding to work with the
leadership in developing a new bill,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   ``President Reagan is calling a number of members today to urge
them to proceed as rapidly as possible on a new bill and I think we
will be able to show some movement very soon,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman declined to identify the members the president was
calling but said they were ``the leaders who have been involved in
the development of this trade bill over a long period of time'' and
included both Democrats and Republicans.
   Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he is
willing to draft a new trade measure that Reagan might be willing
to sign, but he acknowledged that ``it's a little late in the day
to be talking about a second bill.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., took another tack.
Although he strongly supported the trade bill, at the last minute
he voted against it _ a parliamentary maneuver that could later
allow him to ask for reconsideration of the 1,000-page bill.
   ``This is insurance that the American people can still have a
trade bill this year,'' said Byrd, who argued that efforts to draft
a new measure could become hopelessly bogged down in debate over
complex amendments.
   Fitzwater said Byrd's action ``does complicate it and we
certainly are discouraged that he would try to do that. It is
certainly clear that the president wants a trade bill; the
Republicans want a trade bill; the Democrats, most of them, want a
trade bill; and we would like to see it proceed as quickly as
possible.''
   The centerpiece provisions of the bill Reagan vetoed would
revamp the government's system for imposing import curbs to aid
U.S. industries and retaliate against trade violations.
   Others range from sizable farm export subsidies to repeal of the
1980 windfall profits tax on oil-industry earnings.
   But those were overshadowed in recent weeks by Reagan's
objections to a provision to require companies with 100 employees
or more to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   Republican critics objected to what they called special-interest
provisions and lingering protectionism in the bill, while
supporters in both parties claimed it was vital to farmers and
heavy industries suffering from trade upheavals.
   The House voted overwhelmingly to override the veto last month,
and some of the administration's supporters have said they would
feel more comfortable if they could get a second crack at the issue
before having to face the voters in the fall elections. Democrats
made no effort to disguise their belief that the trade issue can be
translated into votes.
   ``We may lose the battle but we've won the war on this issue,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ``This is no longer an issue between
the Congress and the White House. It is now a presidential campaign
issue.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, Michael Dukakis, has
supported the plant-closing provision and opposed Reagan's veto.
Republican George Bush has sided with Reagan.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., a critic of the bill, said ``this
controversy with the president is not about trade, it is not even
about economics _ it is about politics.''
   He pointed to a sharp rise in U.S. exports since three years ago
when record U.S. trade deficits combined with layoffs in heavy
industries ignited the congressional fight over the issue.
   The final vote to override was 61-37, five votes short of the
required two-thirds of those present and voting. Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., both recuperating from surgery,
were not present.
   Ten Republicans abandoned the White House to vote in favor of
the override effort. Two Democrats voted to sustain Reagan's veto.
   The Reagan administration on Wednesday renewed its call for
trade legislation stripped of the plant-closings provision. It has
opposed that feature on grounds that it would rob management of
``flexibility.''
   The administration also objects to restrictions the bill would
place on Alaskan oil exports.
   Byrd said, however, that even in the case of a fresh piece of
legislation the plant-closings provision would be offered as an
amendment and that he would vote in favor of it.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said it still was
possible to achieve trade legislation this year. But he said it
would be necessary for leaders to ``circle the wagons'' and bar
amendments.
   Told that Byrd had just promised that he would vote in favor of
a plant-closings provision as part of any new bill, Dole said:
``That makes it more difficult.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that the issue ``cannot be
swept under the White House rug.''
   ``If another trade bill is introduced with an advance notice
requirement, I will work hard for its passage,'' he said. ``If a
trade bill is introduced without a notice requirement, I will work
hard to add one.''
   Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., declared that the bill was
``easily one of the worst ideas that Congress has cooked up in a
long time'' and ``jam-packed with benefits for special-interest
manufacturers.''
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a fierce foe of the plant-closings
provision, issued a statement from Vice President William T. Archey
saying it was time to preserve the best of the bill minus the
notice feature. ``We cannot let those efforts die,'' he said.
   The AFL-CIO declared that ``fairness and decency were voted
down'' in the plant-closings issue. It vowed not to ``support a
trade bill stripped of a conscience and blind to the community
miseries caused by shutdowns planned and executed in secret.''

<HEAD>Trade Deficit 22 Percent Higher After Seasonal Adjustment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The merchandise trade deficit for March was
revised upward 22 percent to $11.9 billion under a system of
seasonal adjustments that is being resumed, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department released new trade figures that for the
first time in two years adjusted the monthly numbers for normal
seasonal changes in shipping patterns.
   A month ago, the government had reported that the trade deficit
was at $9.7 billion, its best showing in three years. However,
analysts cautioned at the time that trade figures often improve in
March because it is a good month for U.S. export sales.
   A February deficit, which had originally been reported at $13.8
billion, was raised to $14.4 billion.
   The January deficit, originally reported as $12.4 billion, was
lowered by the seasonal adjustment to $11.3 billion.
   The April trade deficit is scheduled to be reported next Tuesday
and it will be reported on a seasonally adjusted basis although the
government will continue to release the unadjusted figures as well.
   Government statisticians hope that by seasonally adjusting the
trade figures they will be able to smooth out some of the
volatility that has often roiled financial markets around the world.
   The U.S. trade deficit has become the most closely watched
government statistic, especially on foreign exchange markets. A bad
trade figure can trigger a wave of dollar selling which then
depresses stock prices as investors become worried about U.S.
economic prospects.
   Despite the revised figures, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the data still showed a favorable downward trend in
the U.S. deficit.
   ``The trade deficit is on a downward trend, exports are
increasing and it's a very encouraging picture in terms of the
foreign trade deficit,'' he said.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner, who briefed reporters on
the historical revisions, said the trade deficit for the first
three months of this year is running at an annual rate of $150
billion, which if it holds for the entire year, would be a
substantial improvement from the record $170.3 billion deficit
recorded in 1987.
   This figure was revised slightly downward from a previously
reported $171.2 billion deficit, but this change did not reflect
seasonal adjustments but rather the inclusion of previously
unreported export sales.
   Before 1986, the government had always adjusted the monthly
import and export figures to smooth out seasonal shipping patterns,
just as it adjusts most of its other statistical reports. However,
it was forced to abandon the practice for a time when a tide of
imports overwhelmed the ability of the Customs Service to process
the trade information on a timely basis.
   In some months, the so-called carryover of late information on
imports from previous months accounted for 50 percent of the new
month's total.
   That figure has now been reduced to around 3 percent per month.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade following some badly needed and
unexpectedly widespread rain in the Midwest.
   Showers brought slight relief Wednesday to much of Iowa,
Illinois and Indiana, which together produce most of the Midwest's
corn and soybeans.
   But predictions for another spell of hot, dry weather limited
the early rain-related losses, analysts said.
   ``I think the markets overdid it yesterday,'' said Joel Karlin,
an analyst in Chicago with Research Department Inc. ``Admittedly,
we did have about 40 percent rain coverage, particularly in Iowa,
but that will be mitigated by the fact we're supposed to have a
return to hot, dry conditions by this weekend.''
   The U.S. oat crop got no reprieve from the punishing weather,
however. Karlin said that unless it rains within the next week in
the northern Plains, ``you might as well kiss the oat and spring
wheat crops goodbye.''
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.70{ a bushel; corn was 7{ cents
lower to 2 cents higher with July at $2.45 a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 9{ cents higher with July at at $2.43 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 8 cents lower with July at $8.53{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were sharply lower,
with some contracts down the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit, in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .27 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at
72.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with August at 75.50 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to
1.15 cents lower with June at 50.75 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.77 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 50.87 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Wednesday.

   The first major expansion of Medicare in 23
years is headed to the White House, where President Reagan's chief
spokesman said today the legislation to protect America's elderly
from the financial ruin of serious illness is viewed with favor.
   ``The president is very concerned about long-term health care,
as he has said a number of times,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said. ``We don't want to forecast the final action on
this bill, but we look favorably upon it.''
   Vice President George Bush declared his support for the bill,
saying it means the elderly will ``not have to live in fear that
their life's savings would be wiped out by a prolonged
hospitalization.''
   Although the catastrophic illness bill given final legislative
approval Wednesday by the Senate is more ambitious than the
proposal laid out by President Reagan, the administration's No. 1
health official has said he will ask the president to sign it.
   There was no reaction from the White House to the Senate's 86-11
approval of the measure, which came a week after the House voted in
similarly overwhelming fashion for the compromise worked out in
months of negotiations among House and Senate conferees and
administration observers.
   ``This gives additional peace of mind to millions of
Americans,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Finance Committee
chairman who guided the measure in the Senate, said just before
final approval.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., a member of the conference committee
that worked out the final compromise last month, said the
legislation ``is not perfect, but it will vastly improve the lives
of millions of elderly Americans who have high health care bills.''
   ``This can truly be called landmark legislation,'' said Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., another conference committee member.
   But Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., one of the 11 who voted
against the measure, complained that it ``is going to cost
everybody and help very few.''
   Indeed, proponents never argued that the bill will have an
automatic benefit for each of the nation's 32 million Medicare
beneficiaries, 29 million of them past age 65. The other 3 million
qualify for the federal health program because they are medically
disabled.
   Senate action on the catastrophic health bill came shortly after
the House killed a separate measure that would have provided
extensive home benefits for people not sick enough to require
hospitalization or nursing home care.
   Even though it was not intended primarily as a vehicle for
improving long-term care benefits, the new Medicare legislation
does make some improvements in that area as well.
   For example, it extends the coverage available for people who
need skilled nursing care in nursing homes from 100 days a year to
150. It also will enable an elderly person left at home to keep
more money when his or her spouse has to go into a nursing home for
an indefinite stay paid for by Medicaid, the government health
program for the poor.
   Leaders in both the House and Senate have said long-term care
will head the domestic agenda in the next Congress.
   In essence, the new legislation provides a safety net for
Medicare beneficiaries faced with extraordinary expenses from acute
illnesses such as cancer.
   Beyond that, it introduces a general prescription drug benefit
into the Medicare program for the first time _ albeit only for
those who run up more than $600 a year in drug bills.
   The bill is drawn with the idea that potential beneficiaries
will foot the entire cost of the expanded benefits, which are
estimated to cost $32.6 billion over the next five years.
   Each of the 32 million will be assessed $4.00 a month in flat
Medicare premiums to pay for the additional coverage.
   In addition, the estimated 40 percent of the recipients with
enough income to make them subject to federal income taxes _ about
$10,000 minimum a year for an individual _ will be charged a
supplemental premium that amounts to a surtax on their income tax
liability.
   On the benefit side, the measure provides full hospital coverage
after a once-a-year deductible estimated at $564 in 1989. Medicare
now pays full charges for no more than 59 days a year and the
recipient is subject to a deductible for each hospitalization.
   The bill also caps out-of-pocket costs for doctor bills at
$1,370 a year. After a $75 deductible, Medicare now pays 80 percent
of approved doctor bills and that part of the program remains
intact. Starting in 1989, however, the $75 deductible and the 20
percent share paid by beneficiaries counts toward the $1,370 cap.
After that is reached, Medicare pays 100 percent of approved doctor
bills.
   However, the beneficiary will remain liable for any portion of
doctor bills that exceed the set fees approved by Medicare.
   The new drug benefit calls for Medicare to pay half of
outpatient prescription drug costs in 1991 after a $600 deductible
is met. The government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 and 80
percent in 1993. However, the deductible is expected to rise each
year to keep pace with rising drug costs.
   The supplemental premium starts at $22.50 a year for each $150
of income tax owed in 1989, climbing to an additional $42 a year on
each $150 of tax liability by 1993. There is an $800 cap on the
supplemental premium in 1989, climbing to $1,050 in 1993.

   Bond prices were mixed in early trading today.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 1-16 point, or
about 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. The long bond's yield,
which moves inversely to its price, was unchanged from late
Wednesday at 9.01 percent.
   Analysts said profit-taking and some mild jitters in
anticipation of upcoming economic statistics were mainly to blame.
   ``There is some fairly decent selling,'' said Jay Goldinger, of
Capital Insight, an investment banking firm in Beverly Hills,
Calif. At the same time, he said, an unexplainable bullishness is
still continuing to pressure prices higher.
   Traders remained anxious over Friday's release of May's producer
price index in Washington, as well as the ``long-dreaded trade
figures'' next week, Goldinger said.
   ``The market is rallying in the face of awful news (including)
rising commodity prices, which should turn into inflation leading
to a tightened monetary policy,'' he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities rose 1-16 point
and long-term issues were down [ point, according to the Telerate
business information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the

   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, '' and that he is a steadfast
son of the
church.
   ``He is a member of the church, was baptized in it and he has
never left it,'' Archbishop Iakovos says of the front-running
Democratic presidential contender, who has been assailed as ``an
apostate.''
   ``The attack is wrong in itself,'' Iakovos added in an
interview. His eyes flashed. ``It came from small people.''
   In widely distributed letters, James G. Jatras, a staff member
of the Senate Republican Policy Committee and a church layman,
called Dukakis a ``renegade, an outcast'' for his positions and his
marriage to a Jew.
   Jatras, writing under his Greek name, Dimitrios Iatreidis, said
Dukakis' church membership was ``severed by your marriage outside
the church.'' Iakovos termed that untrue.
   The white-haired archbishop, 76, who has maintained
relationships with Dukakis and his parents since his boyhood, noted
that Dukakis considers him ``his spiritual father,'' and added:
   ``We are proud that one of our young men has had the courage and
determination to run for the highest office in the nation.''
   While making no formal endorsement, avoided under church policy,
he said, ``I would put it that 99 percent of us are very proud
Dukakis is a front runner and almost certain nominee.''
   Iakovos, recalling the years 1942 to l954 when he was dean of
Boston's Annunciation Cathedral to which the Dukakis family
belonged and where he still is a regularly contributing member,
said:
   ``I remember him in his Sunday school pupil days. He was a
frequent participant as a teenager. The Dukakis family was one of
the best families in the church, his father a physician, his mother
a teacher of English.''
   Iakaovos, who has talked with Dukakis frequently over the years,
encouraging his political efforts, sometimes praying with him, said:
   ``Michael is a man who does much thinking, who doesn't react
emotionally. He has a very good head on his shoulders. He's very
learned. He is moderate, not a man of extremes. He's very prudent,
very careful, very studious.''
   Of Dukakis' marriage to a non-Christian, which under church
rules technically bars him from receiving communion (as are
divorced, remarried Roman Catholics) but does not excommunicate or
remove him from membership, Iakovos said:
   ``He did not leave the church. He is not excluded. He's not the
only one who has married outside the church.''
   The archbishop said about 70 percent of Greek Orthodox marriages
are with those of other denominations, an increasing number with
Jews.
   ``Its happening more and more now,'' he said. ``I have a
pastoral obligation to all our people, to strengthen and encourage
them.''
   He noted that Dukakis visited archdiocesan headquarters on
Manhattan's East 79th St. on April 14, took part in vespers
services and afterward met with Iakovos in his chandeliered,
second-floor offices.
   ``We had a brief service in the chapel,'' he said. ``Then we
discussed freely some of the issues.''
   Jatras made his charges in an open letter to Dukakis sent to all
Orthodox bishops and many others, as well as in letters to the
weekly Greek American which termed the attack a ``cheap political
ploy.''
   Jatras claimed Dukakis ``excommunicated himself'' by marriage to
a Jew and is ``a traitor'' who ``defames our church'' by upholding
legal abortion and opposing aid to Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The archbishop said it ``was fanatic'' to attack a candidate's
church relationship. ``I find it extremely unjustified to make such
statements, to attack anyone running for any office on the basis of
his beliefs.
   ``In this multi-cultural, multi-national society, religion is
not one of the criteria for being elected president of the United
States.''
   While Greek Orthodoxy opposes abortion, he said Dukakis'
position resembled that of New York Governor Cuomo, a Roman
Catholic, in contending political leaders must uphold the law and
not try to impose their views about it.
   ``The president is president of all citizens, believers and
non-believers as well,'' Iakovos said. ``Any transgressions across
the border between state and church is at the expense of the unity
of the nation.''
   He said he had encouraged Dukakis' decision to seek the
presidency.
   Asked about Dukakis' religious commitment, Iakovos said ``this
is a very subjective matter,'' but Dukakis has been a steady church
member. ``He has embraced it all these years. This is not something
new. Many times, he would say I was his spiritual father.
   ``Through the campaign, I think he is feeling much closer to the
community than before.''
   He said that it seemed strange the attack about Dukakis'
religion didn't come until ``he was running for the presidency, but
then they start scrutinizing his conformity to church rules.
   ``If the man is qualified, and God wants him to be president, he
will be. Michael has some of the qualities we seek in that
position.''

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Down For 13th Month In Row</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus fell 21 percent to $5.05
billion in May, the 13th straight month the surplus has decreased
from its level of a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said
Thursday.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 25.6 percent
to $3.30 billion from $4.44 billion in May 1987. It was also down
from $4.13 billion the previous month.
   Economists were divided over whether the trade deficit would
continue to shrink.
   ``In a word, I think we can say things have been moving in a
desirable direction,'' said Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at
Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
   Imports are likely to continue to grow while the yen's
appreciation and the shift in production to overseas by Japanese
manufacturers will restrain exports, leading to a continued drop in
the trade surplus, Kakimoto said.
   But it is possible the trade surplus will not diminish further
in coming months, said Yoshihiro Furukane, senior economist at
Yamaichi Research Institute of Economics.
   Although imports are growing, exports are also up because
Japanese manufacturers have found ways to cope with the strength of
the yen, Furukane said.
   May's overall trade surplus was down from $6.42 billion in the
same month last year and from $6.77 billion in April, according to
figures the ministry released.
   Japan's trade surplus has shrunk in comparison with the same
month a year earlier since May 1987, reflecting the sharp rise in
the value of the yen and expanding domestic demand in the Japanese
economy.
   Imports surged 26.7 percent to $15.45 billion from $12.2 billion
in May 1987, although they dipped 1.7 percent from April's $15.7
billion.
   Exports also continued to show considerable growth, though the
pace of increase has varied from month to month recently.
   Exports were up 10.2 percent to $20.5 billion from $18.6 billion
in May 1987, but showed an 8.8 percent drop from $22.5 billion in
April of this year.
   Imports of manufactured goods continued to be strong, accounting
for 48.6 percent of the country's total imports in May. That was
down slightly from 49.9 percent in April.
   The Finance Ministry trade figures were calculated on a
customs-clearance basis, with shipping and insurance costs included
for imports but not for exports. Japan's trade surplus would have
been larger if the costs had been included in both categories.

<HEAD>Why Uncle Sam Has A Pot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you dieted the way Uncle Sam diets, you too
would have a pot. His pot is more financial than physical, but the
principle is the same.
   When Uncle Sam diets, he grows in size. He grows in size because
he kids himself about the numbers he lives by and because he snacks
between meals, gobbling up financial calories that he tends not to
count.
   If you went on a comparable food diet you first would add
numbers to the weight that appeared on the scale, and then you
would deduct from that inflated figure. And you wouldn't count any
pounds that came from snacking.
   The results would be exactly what you deserved for kidding
yourself. You would gain weight while telling yourself and anybody
else who might listen that you were losing pounds. Sooner or later,
your credibility would shrink.
   The subject arises for at least two reasons: The annual budget
debate is under way and this is a presidential election year, which
makes it a year of big dreams and unrealistic promises.
   The primary claim to be made is that the budget has been cut
repeatedly during the 1980s. The fact is there has been no
budgetary diet at all since 1980.
   Oh, there have been so-called tax cuts, but some of the ``cuts''
haven't been cuts. There's been a lot of snacking going on too, or
tax increases made without much publicity _ or at least not as much
as the so-called cuts.
   There's no other way to explain how 1988 spending is estimated
to be about $1.06 trillion versus $591 billion in 1980.
   Marginal tax rates were reduced by the 1981 Economic Recovery
Tax Act, but taxes in total weren't cut. In addition, the snacking
continued. Four big tax increases altogether nibbled away the
impact of the 1981 rate cut.
   The truth, according to Citizens For A Sound Economy, a
nonprofit budget-watching group, is that in spite of all the talk
of financial dieting, Uncle Sam's spending has risen 79 percent, or
$59 billion a year, since 1980.
   Why, then, has there been so much talk about budget cutting?
   The answer lies in the practice of ``current services
budgeting,'' an odd two-step planning tool that serves to fool. In
the first step you raise the numbers beyond what they really are.
You then cut back from the larger number.
   It appears not to matter that reality _ financial reality _ is
ignored as much in this diet as pounds often are in the dieting
procedures that rely on self-delusion.
   A current services budget automatically assumes spending will
rise in the next year. Therefore, proposed spending levels are
compared not to how much is being spent in the current year but to
how much could be spent in the next.
   For instance, says Dan Mitchell of the Sound Economy group, if
the current services budget foresees a program costing 10 percent
more, but the president or Congress proposes a 4 percent increase,
the effect is a 6 percent ``cut.''
   There's nothing wrong with the concept, says Mitchell, but
there's a lot wrong with the practice.
   The type of information it provides _ telling policymakers how
much spending would have to rise to keep pace with inflation,
demographic changes and changes in the law _ is valuable, says
Mitchell.
   But, he adds, the practice of making it a yardstick against
which all budget proposals are judged quite definitely is
misleading. It also is confusing, and to some ways of thinking it
is quite irrational.
   As irrational, in fact, as a guy with a pot seeking your
approval for all the hard work and deprivation he endured in
``cutting'' his weight from 300 pounds to just 500.

<HEAD>Survey: Pay Raises Should Average 5 Percent This Year For Salaried
Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pay increases should average about 5 percent
this year and next for the nation's salaried workforce, narrowly
outpacing expected inflation, according to a survey released
Thursday.
   The Conference Board, a private business-information group,
reported the salaries of workers who were covered by overtime and
other labor law provisions, such as clerical workers, would rise an
average of 4.8 percent this year.
   Salaries of exempt workers, such as management and
professionals, would rise an average of 5 percent, while executive
salary increases would average 5.4 percent, the group reported.
   Average increases for 1989 were virtually the same in all three
groups, according to the Conference Board's salary survey of 649
companies.
   ``Management appears determined to keep average salary increases
to about 5 percent and not permit an upward escalation,'' said
Charles Peck, the group's compensation analyst. ``If inflation
nudges up, however ... it will be more difficult to hold the salary
increase line at 5 percent.''
   The Conference Board's Economic Forum has projected inflation,
as measured by consumer price increases, of 4.5 percent this year
and 4.7 percent in 1989, compared with 3.6 percent in 1987.
   The survey also indicated that 8 percent of the surveyed
companies were giving some of their employees lump-sum payments
instead of pay raises.

<TEXT>
   A former E.F. Hutton & Co. Inc. broker
has pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his role in a
money-laundering scheme conducted at the brokerage firm's
Providence office
   Brian J. Lareau pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of
violating the Social Security Act and one money-laundering count
before U.S. District Court Judge Francis J. Boyle.
   Lareau, 46, of Jamestown, worked for the Hutton branch from 1980
to 1985. He admitted to laundering $183,950 from August 1982 to
October 1984.
   Federal authorities said Lareau, and another former broker,
since deceased, helped clients hide about $1.5 million in cash from
the Internal Revenue Service.
   According to court documents, Lareau created a fictitious
account and used it to conceal his customer's money from the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the IRS.
   The fake Social Security number was used on the account over a
four-year period every time Lareau and the client transacted
business, said Voorhees.
   Another former Hutton broker, Stephen S. Fusco, who died two
years ago of cancer, was also charged with being involved in the
office's scheme. Fusco was accused of helping members of organized
crime turn illegally earned money into legitimate income.
   The Social Securities count against Lareau is a federal felony,
punishable by maximum penalties of five years in prison and $6,000
in fines.
   The money-laundering count is a misdemeanor. It is a felony only
if more than $100,000 is laundered in any 12-month period. It
carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and $1,000.
   Federal law enforcement officials said Lareau never laundered
more than $99,000 in any one-year period.
   Voorhees said the government agreed, in return for Lareau's
plea, to recommend he spend six months in jail and be placed on
probation for five years. Lareau also faces fines of up to $6,000
when he is sentenced July 22.
   E.F. Hutton plead guilty May 16 to two money-laundering charges
and one count of conspiracy. It was fined $1.01 million, the
largest fine ever imposed on a money-laundering case.
   Hutton was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
and the company is now known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is examining a French
proposal to forgive some of the debts of the world's poorest
countries, the State Department said Thursday.
   The proposal was transmitted in a letter to President Ronald
Reagan by French President Francois Mitterrand, said deputy
spokesman Phyllis Oakley.
   The French government announced Wednesday that it would forgive
one-third of such debts to it and would advise other members of the
Paris Club _ which includes the major creditor governments _ to do
the same.
   The plan would not apply to the world's most indebted developing
nations, such as Brazil and Mexico, because they are not among the
poorest, although France indicated it believed ways also must be
found to help them.
   ``We are studying the French proposal very closely,'' said Mrs.
Oakley.

equities were still inspired by Wednesday's 48.36-point gain to
2,102.95 and a positive finish to stock index futures in New York
on Wednesday.
   The jump higher in London was ``a belated recognition on the
move Wednesday on Wall Street,'' said Nicholas Knight, an equity
strategist with James Capel and Co. in London.
   ``There's an understanding in the market that we're approaching
post-crash highs, so no one wants to pile in unless there's
certainty that we'll take out those post-crash highs,'' Knight said.
   A spate of expectedly good results failed to stimulate buying,
and there was little other news to generate excitement for most of
the day.

   The stock market edged upward today, struggling
to extend its recent rally near its highest levels of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 48.36 points on
Wednesday, added .71 to 2,103.66 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 819 up, 659 down and
465 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 206.56 million shares with an
hour to go.
   A good part of that activity was concentrated in a single issue
_ Detroit Edison, which was steady at 14 amid a flurry of large
blocks keyed to the company's impending quarterly dividend.
   But otherwise, analysts said signs persisted of increased
enthusiasm for stocks among money managers at investing
institutions.
   Until late last month, fears of rising interest rates and
inflation prompted those professionals to keep large amounts of
their assets out of the stock market.
   But with interest-rate fears having cooled and stocks up sharply
in the past week and a half, analysts said money managers might
feel mounting pressure to make heavier commitments to stocks in
time for their midyear reports to clients.
   Pannill Knitting climbed 2{ to 9}. Late Wednesday Sara Lee Corp.
said it would make a $10-a-share tender offer for 50 percent of
Pannill.
   Infinity Broadcasting jumped 8} to 30\ in the over-the-counter
market. A management group offered to acquire the company for $30 a
share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.03 to 152.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.94 at 308.17.

   Soybean and oat futures prices soared and other
grain futures closed modestly higher Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid diminishing prospects for rain next week in the
Midwest.
   Soybeans gyrated wildly during the session as traders digested a
confusing mix of weather information. Prices opened slightly lower
in reaction to rains Wednesday in Grain Belt, fell sharply in
response to the National Weather Service's forecast for normal
precipitation next week, then skyrocketed in the afternoon after
private meteorologists predicted a hot, dry weekend followed by
drier-than-normal conditions next week, analysts said.
   Oat futures gained throughout the session as forecasts indicated
no improvement in the drought conditions plaguing the upper Midwest.
   ``They're saying a lot of the damage is irreversible,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 5 cents higher with
July at $3.72 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher
with July at $2.53{ a bushel; oats were 11 cents to 15 cents higher
with July at $2.50 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 30 cents
higher with July at $8.86 a bushel.

   Assets of the nation's 429 money market mutual
funds fell $1.7 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $267.29 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $4.32 billion drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The previous week's decline initially was reported as $5.04
billion by the group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 214 general purpose funds fell $681.2 million to $82.95
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds dropped $5.9 million to
$113.73 billion, and assets of 118 institutional funds declined
$1.01 billion to $70.61 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.42 percent from 6.37 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield also rose, to 6.33 percent from 6.26
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
37 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.73 percent as of Wednesday from 5.72 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.13 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.10
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.06 the
previous week. Yields were 7.44 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.39
percent; 7.84 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.79 percent; and
8.27 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.25 percent.

   Campeau Corp.'s elimination of thousands of jobs
at Federated Department Stores Inc. will result in a more
cost-effective organization, Wall Street analysts say. But they
also expect the cuts to affect the merchandise the stores offer.
   ``There will be much more efficiency here'' after the
reductions, said Walter Loeb, a retail industry analyst with the
investment firm Morgan Stanley & Co.
   But William Smith, at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said of
the streamlining: ``You hope it's being done strategically.''
   The string of layoffs announced over recent days were expected
after financier Robert Campeau took control of Federated in a $6.6
billion tender offer last month. After buying Allied Stores Corp.
at the end of 1986, Campeau made similar cuts.
   So far, there have been layoffs at five of the six Federated
department store divisions and among the company's corporate staff.
   Goldsmith's, a six-store chain based in Memphis, Tenn., fired 25
percent of its 2,400 employees, and at Columbus, Ohio-based
Lazarus, 1,200 people were let go, representing 8 percent of the
employees at its 43 stores.
   Abraham and Straus, a New York-based chain with 14 stores, laid
off 794 employees, or 7 percent of its work force, while Burdine's
in Miami, with 27 stores, let go 320 workers, or 3 percent.
   Atlanta-based Rich's, with 20 stores, laid off 250 workers, or 3
percent, and Federated's corporate staff lost 207 employees, or 40
percent.
   Bloomingdale's, Federated's star division, also is expected to
announce layoffs. Reports have said at least 400 employees, or 3
percent of the division's work force, will be cut.
   Some of these layoffs were the result of consolidation of
divisions. Goldsmith's is being merged into Rich's and the
centralized operations of Federated will be combined with those of
Allied Stores Corp., Campeau's other retail division.
   Carol Sanger, a Federated spokeswoman, said the cuts were being
made in ``back of the house'' operations. Buying and sales staffs
were not affected, she said, and consumers should not see any
changes in merchandising or customer service.
   ``Just because you let someone go in the credit office or the
distribution office doesn't mean what you see on the sales floor
will be any different,'' she said.
   Joele Frank, a Campeau spokeswoman, said some buying operations
would be centralized and become more cost effective. Under the old
Federated system, one clothing manufacturer would deal separately
with the various divisions and sometimes had different prices for
each, she said.
   Some analysts worried about the ultimate effect the changes
would have on the merchandise customers will find at Federated's
stores.
   Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co., said
he thinks store buyers were among those let go and he expects
merchandise to reflect such layoffs.
   ``Typically, when you sharply cut back your number of buyers,
you're buying more of the same lines at your stores,'' Greenstein
said.
   Smith, the analyst at Smith Barney, said: ``If in normal times,
you'd see a cutback like this, you'd think they'd pay more and buy
better merchandise. I doubt that's what's in Mr. Campeau's mind
right now.''
   The result at Federated, analysts said, will be part of a trend
in retailing nationwide toward ``sameness'' _ similar merchandise
offered by many stores with less selection available. Industry
observers are critical of sameness, saying it reduces
innovativeness and creativity.
   A company like Federated ``needs a very refined buying procedure
to have distinctiveness among the stores,'' said Loeb, at Morgan
Stanley.
   But Robert Buchanan, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in
St. Louis, said there still can be room for input from the various
divisions.
   ``It's up to the local department store buyers to determine how
much they want, what sizes, what colors, what styles,'' he said.
   Smith warned that the wrong cuts could hurt at Bloomingdale's,
which thrives on its unique and trendy ambiance.
   But the analysts also note that the reductions were long overdue.
   ``One of the criticisms of Federated over the years and that
impeded their performance and put them into a position to be ripe
for takeover is they failed to make the kind of consolidations in
operations that would have made them more cost-effective,'' said
Smith.
   Campeau is not the only one trimming department store staffs.
   May Department Stores Inc., which bought the Foley's and
Filene's divisions from Federated after Campeau took control, has
announced it is laying off 800 employees, or 5 percent, of the
Foley's work force.
   R.H. Macy & Co. Inc., which bought Federated's Bullock's and I.
Magnin divisions, declined to comment on whether it planned any
layoffs.

   A consumer group's accusation that the sporty
Suzuki Samurai is prone to roll over was denounced Thursday by the
Japanese automaker as ``inaccurate and defamatory.''
   Test results announced last week by Consumers Union, the New
York publisher of Consumer Reports Magazine, unfairly suggest the
popular four-wheel drive vehicle is unsafe under normal driving
conditions, said Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of
American Suzuki Motor Corp.
   ``If the magazine had acted responsibly and reviewed the
available information it would have been aware that the Samurai has
one of the best records on file,'' Mazza said.
   Last week the influential consumer organization condemned the
Samurai as being so prone to roll over that it cannot be modified
to be safe. Consumers Union recommended a omplete recall of the
120,000 or more Samurais sold in America and a complete refund to
owners.
   Responding to the accusations made by Suzuki in news conferences
in Los Angeles, New York and Detroit, Consumers Union spokesman
David Berliner defended the organization's tests as valid. He said
similar vehicles made by competitors passed the same tests that
caused the Samurai to tip over.
   Government accident statistics and tests conducted by an
independent automotive safety consultant showed the Samurai was as
safe or safer than other sport-utility vehicles, Mazza said. That
industry term refers to four-wheel drive cars and light pick-up
trucks.
   Samurai is considering legal action against Consumers Union,
Mazza said. He suggested the consumer group made its accusations as
part of a calculated campaign to persuade the government to adopt
stricter rollover standards.
   ``For years the Consumers Union has been pressing the government
for an unrealistic rollover standard,'' Mazza said. ``What better
way than pressing the smallest Japanese automaker with the No. 1
selling sport-utility vehicle?''

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended May 30, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3.011 trillion from $3.007 trillion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3.786 trillion from $3.782 trillion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $771.2 billion from a revised $769.1 billion.
The previous week's total initially was estimated at $769.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In setting its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $767.7 billion, a 6 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks.
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $142 million,
compared with an increase of $96 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $395 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, down from $776 million the previous week.

   The dollar lost ground Thursday against all
major currencies in fairly active domestic trading after rising
overseas, amid reports of continued West German dollar selling.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold bullion was bid at $456.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
$1 an ounce from late Wednesday.
   Currency traders and analysts said there were doubts whether
Karl Otto Poehl, head of the West German Bundesbank, was sincere
when he said that the central bank recently sold about $2 billion
solely to trim its dollar reserves, not to depress the U.S.
currency.
   The dollar had rallied on those remarks Wednesday, along with
comments from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that a
further depreciation of the currency wouldn't help the nation's
trade deficit.
   ``The market reassessment of that (Poehl's remarks) was that it
didn't continue to feel that was true,'' said James T. McGroarty, a
vice president at Discount Corp. in New York.
   He said the dollar headed lower after traders learned that the
Bundesbank sold a small amount of dollars Thursday.
   Analsyts also blamed the dollar drop on technical factors, as
well as an upward revision in the March trade deficit report.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that with seasonal
adjustment, the trade gap for March turned out to be $11.9 billion,
22 percent higher than the previously reported $9.7 billion figure.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed up 0.11 yen at 125.43 yen. In London, the
dollar traded at 125.25 yen, while in New York, it stood at 124.60
yen, down from 125.615 late Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8117 late Thursday, cheaper
for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.8175. Sterling fetched $1.8215
in New York, up from $1.81025.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.71425 West German marks, down from 1.7261;
1.43075 Swiss francs, down from 1.4386; 1.21945 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.22175; 5.7935 French francs, down from 5.8175; and
1,274.50 Italian lire, down from 1,280.88.
   Late rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday,
included: 1.7230 West German marks, up from 1.7183; 1.4370 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4350; 5.8155 French francs, up from 5.7923;
1.9330 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9250; 1.2211 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2220; and 1,280.50 Italian lire, up from 1,273.50.
   Gold prices rose in domestic trading following a mixed
performance abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $457.10 a troy ounce from $456.10 an ounce late
Wednesday.
   In London, the late bid was $455.25 an ounce, down from $458,
while in Zurich, gold was bid at $455.50 an ounce, down from
$458.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed up at $456.59 an ounce from
$458.98.
   Silver prices declined. On the New York Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery traded at $7.145 a troy ounce, down from $7.15
late Wednesday.
   In London, silver was bid at $7.08 a troy ounce, down 7 cents.

   Farmers are harvesting a winter wheat crop
estimated at 1.57 billion bushels, slightly larger than last year's
but 3 percent under a forecast of 1.62 billion bushels issued a
month ago, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The 50 million bushel cutback in the forecast came amid an early
drought across the midcontinent.
   ``Inadequate moisture and disease plagued winter wheat in the
central and northern Great Plains during May,'' the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said in its report.
   Some officials said satellite photos show streak mosaic disease
is taking a toll on soft red winter wheat in Kansas and that the
dry weather could worsen the situation there. But they said a
little rain could cut damage to a minimum in other parts of the
country.
   The new forecast compares with a 1987 winter wheat output of
1.56 billion bushels. Officials said average yield should by 39.4
bushels an acre, down 0.4 bushels an acre from the 1987 level and
1.3 bushels below the May estimate.
   Crop conditions vary, the department's Agricultural Statistics
Board said in its report. As of May 29, crop conditions were mostly
fair to good in the Corn Belt, Southeast and Pacific Northwest and
fair in the Plains States, it said.
   Development of the crop was average or better except in the
Pacific Northwest and Colorado, it said. The wheat was turning
color in Illinois, Kansas and Missouri and the harvest had moved
into Oklahoma and expanded across the Delta and Southeast.
   Farmers are expected to have about 39.8 million acres for
harvest this year, the same estimate the department issued last
month and 1 percent above the level for last season.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production.
   No 1988 production estimates for spring wheat, corn and other
spring-planted crops were included in the forecast. They will be
estimated by USDA later in the growing season.
   A separate supply and demand report from the department's
Economic Research Service did say that, despite the estimated 50
million-bushel cutback, the overall U.S. wheat crop should be above
last year's level. It said that was so because of projected spring
wheat production.
   It said, moreover, that flour and related food production would
be lower by perhaps 35 million bushels and the reduction should
offset somewhat the reduced supply of winter wheat. Thus it
projected only a slight reduction in the nation's wheat stockpile.
   The Kansas winter wheat crop, as usual the largest by far, was
estimated at 329 million bushels, down from 366.3 million in 1987.
The yield was put at 35 bushels per acre compared with 37 bushels
last year. The state's farmers also trimmed their acreage to 9.4
million acres from 9.9 million in 1987.
   Indicated production of winter wheat and average yields in 1988
by major producing states, based on June 1 prospects, included:
   Arkansas, 41,800,000 bushels and an average yield of 44 bushels
per acre; California, 35,640,000 and 81; Colorado, 86,950,000 and
37; Georgia, 19,780,000 and 43; Idaho, 56,880,000 and 72; Illinois,
61,600,000 and 55; Indiana, 34,300,000 and 49; Kansas, 329,000,000
and 35; Kentucky, 15,990,000 and 41; Michigan, 29,140,000 and 47;
Missouri, 65,800,000 and 47; Montana, 52,800,000 and 24; Nebraska,
86,100,000 and 42; North Carolina, 18,900,000 and 42; Ohio,
49,920,000 and 48; Oklahoma, 176,400,000 and 36; Oregon, 42,900,000
and 66; South Dakota, 46,500,000 and 30; Tennessee, 14,820,000 and
39; Texas, 92,800,000 and 29; Washington, 89,100,000 and 54.

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said
Thursday that the company is studying ways to restructure its
troubled Eastern Airlines subsidiary but has no plans to sell the
operation.
   He did not offer any specifics of what changes might be in store
for Eastern, which is saddled with bitter labor relations and
recently passed a two-month government safety investigation.
   Speaking at the company's annual meeting, Lorenzo told
shareholders that despite the persistent labor agitation and
financial troubles at the Miami-based airline, ``Eastern Airlines
is not for sale.''
   But he placed a price tag of sorts on the airline by disclosing
that a recent study by Texas Air found Eastern had a net-asset
value of $2 billion, or nearly $50 for each Texas Air share.
   Net-asset value takes into account debts and liabilities, and
includes items such as aircraft and airport terminals.
   Several analysts declined to put their own estimates on
Eastern's value, but Timothy Pettee, at the investment firm Bear
Stearns & Co., estimated Eastern's net-asset value at closer to
$500 million.
   Stock in Texas Air, which also owns Houston-based Continental
Airlines, was up 12{ cents to $12 a share on the American Stock
Exchange.
   Lorenzo, who controls 34 percent of the voting power of Texas
Air shares, said management was looking at ways to improve
shareholder values but declined to specify any actions under study.
   However, the company announced later Thursday that the board had
adopted an anti-takeover plan aimed at making a hostile buyout
prohibitively expensive. Under the plan, Texas Air stockholders
would be able to acquire for half price shares in any company that
buys 25 percent or more of Texas Air's common stock and later
acquires Texas Air, or in any company that acquires more than 50
percent of Texas Air's assets or earnings power.
   ``The board...has taken this step because, among other things,
the common stock of the company is currently selling for a very low
price in relation to to per share value of the assets of the
company,'' senior vice president Charles T. Goolsbee said in a news
release.
   Goolsbee said the plan was intended to encourage any bidders
that might emerge to negotiate ``a fair price'' with the board.
   Together, the Texas Air carriers have a debt of around $5.4
billion. The parent company posted a record after-tax loss of $466
million in 1987.
   Lorenzo could be thinking of selling some of Eastern's aircraft
and leasing them back, Pettee suggested. He noted the carrier owns
about 70 percent of its fleet _ well above the industry average of
around 50 percent.
   ``It's basically the ace in the hole,'' Pettee said.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes told shareholders that ``Eastern
must be restructured and positioned for future profitability.''
   He said Eastern management had cut about $200 million in annual
costs and was ``striving mightily'' to resolve its problems with
its unions.
   Eastern and Texas Air recently sued the pilots and machinists
unions at Eastern for $1.5 billion, accusing them of ``Eastern
bashing'' and trying to drive down the value of the company.
   Eastern, with a total work force of around 38,000, announced
layoffs of 3,500 employees last November.
   ``There's no love lost between labor and Frank Lorenzo,'' said
Andrew Geller, an airline analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia.
   By introducing the $2 billion figure, Geller suggested, the
Texas Air chief could have been floating a potential price tag for
Eastern as well as warning the carrier's restive unions that he
could sell it.
   Lorenzo presided over an often tense but generally controlled
meeting, threatening several times to have security guards eject
shareholders and union members who continued their questioning
after he had asked them to refrain.
   A small group of protesters calling themselves Abused Passengers
and Employees Against Lorenzo demonstrated outside the meeting at
Chase Manhattan Bank's headquarters.
   Lorenzo was flush from a victory earlier this week when a
federal appeals court in Washington lifted a ban on the sale of
Eastern's Northeast shuttle operations to another subsidiary of
Texas Air.
   A few days before that, the Federal Aviation Administration
concluded after a two-month investigation of Eastern and
Continental that they are safe to fly.
   The FAA said, however, that the bitter labor-management war at
Eastern raised possible safety risks if allowed to continue. The
agency said it would continue its surveillance of Eastern.
   Continental President Martin Shugrue said he was ``pleased, but
not surprised'' that the FAA had given Continental a clean bill of
health on safety.
   He said Continental was making substantial investments to
improve its financial performance.
   ``We've now completed the most complex integration in the
history of the airline industry,'' said Shugrue, a former vice
chairman of Pan Am Corp.
   In recent years Texas Air has acquired Continental, Eastern,
Frontier, People Express and New York Air. The latter three were
absorbed into Continental.

   Campeau Corp. on Thursday announced it had
agreed to sell the Filene's Basement division of Federated
Department Stores Inc. to an investor group led by Filene's
management.
   Terms of the deal, which includes the sale of 22 women's
clothing stores in the Northeast, were not disclosed.
   Besides Filene's management, the investor group includes the
investment companies, Greylock, Oak Investment Partners and J.H.
Whitney, Campeau said in a statement.
   The sale was the first of a Federated specialty store division
since Campeau took control of Federated last month in a $6.6
billion tender offer. Campeau also plans to sell Federated's Main
Street and Children's Place divisions as well as its Gold Circle
discount store chain.
   Campeau also has sold four of Federated's department store
divisions. Foley's and Filene's were bought by May Department
Stores Inc. and the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains went to R.H.
Macy & Co. Inc., which lost Federated to Campeau in a bitter
takeover battle.
   Filene's department stores were separate from the Filene's
Basement specialty store chain.
   Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau said after he won his takeover
fight he planned to raise $4.4 billion through asset sales to help
finance the purchase of Federated. He also has sold the Brooks
Brothers chain from his Allied Stores Corp. to the British retailer
Marks & Spencer.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Post Second Day Of Limit Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork futures prices plummeted their daily limits Thursday for
the second consecutive session as traders wrestled with weak demand
for pork products and abundant supplies of pork bellies.
   On other markets, soybean and oat futures soared; precious
metals gained; energy futures fell and stock-index futures
retreated.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 agricultural and
industrial commodities advanced 1.87 points to 258.20.
   Weak wholesale demand for pork products has slowed packer demand
for hogs, raising fears that a backlog of slaughter-ready animals
has developed, analysts said.
   ``You've got a lot of people who really believe we've got tons
and tons of pork coming down the road,'' said Thomas Morgan,
president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
``That's what's got the hog markets in a tizzy.''
   Meanwhile, supplies of frozen pork bellies, which are sliced to
make bacon, have reached near-record proportions. Pork belly
futures prices have fallen sharply this week and may have to come
down even more to stimulate demand, analysts said.
   ``I think they're going to be under a lot of pressure again
tomorrow,'' said Philip Stanley, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   The August hog contract plunged the 1.5-cent daily limit
Thursday, settling at 48.70 cents a pound. Most pork belly
contracts fell the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit.
   Analysts said cattle futures fell in sympathy with pork prices.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .47 cent lower with the contract
for delivery in June at 72.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27
cent lower to .22 cent higher with August at 75.30 cents a pound;
hogs were 1.50 cents lower to .23 cent higher with June at 51 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.50 cents to 2 cents lower with
July at 50.87 cents a pound.
   Soybean and oat futures prices soared while other grain futures
advanced modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade amid diminishing
prospects for rain next week in the Midwest.
   Soybeans gyrated wildly during the session as private
meteorologists reduced the amount of rain in their forecasts.
   Most oat contracts advanced the expanded daily limit of 15 cents
a bushel as forecasts indicated no improvement in the drought
conditions plaguing the upper Midwest.
   ``They're saying a lot of the damage is irreversible,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   Limits on oats, soybeans, soybean meal and corn were expanded by
50 percent Monday following two straight days of maximum
permissible gains. The limits will return to normal on Friday.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department issued its monthly
report on U.S. wheat production and grain supply and demand.
   The USDA reduced its 1988 wheat production estimate to 1.57
billion bushels from 1.62 billion bushels. But the estimate was
above most analysts' expectations and was pronounced slightly
bearish for futures prices.
   The USDA slightly increased its projections for soybean and corn
ending stocks for both the current marketing year and the 1988-89
year while reducing its projected wheat ending stocks for both
years.
   But Lespinasse noted the predictions were based on conditions
June 1 ``and a lot of (drought) damage has been done since June 1.''
   ``This report will soon be forgotten,'' he said. ``Everyone will
be concentrating on the weather again tomorrow.''
   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 5 cents higher with July at $3.72
a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 2} cents higher with July at
$2.53} a bushel; oats were 11 cents to 15 cents higher with July at
$2.50 a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 30{ cents higher with
July at $8.86 a bushel.
   Precious metals futures advanced modestly on the Commodity
Exchange in New York in a reversal from the previous day's steep
losses.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.40 higher with August at $461.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 5.5 cents higher with July at $7.18
a troy ounce.
   Energy futures posted substantial losses on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on expecatations that OPEC oil ministers will
not make any headway on production cuts when they meet this weekend
in Vienna, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents to 30 cents
lower with July at $17.08 a barrel; heating oil was .78 cent to
1.03 cents lower with July at 44.90 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .64 cent to 1 cent lower with July at 49.70 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures fell slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with the contract for delivery in June down 1 point at
271.45.

   Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said it is

Thursday to comment on claims that the move is resulting in layoffs.
   The investment firm said in a statement that in addition to
concentrating on government and corporate securities trading, it
will increase the amount of capital committed to its high-yield
debt and asset-backed securities trading unit.
   Spokesman Paul Marrone said managers involved in the
restructured units will decide whether to add or to lay off
employees. ``There have been no announcements'' on layoffs, he said.
   But a source within the firm on Thursday said people were being
laid off, although he could not provide a specific number. The
executive agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified by
name.
   There were reports on Wall Street that 50 to 100 people were
being laid off.

   Negotiations for the sale of Giant

Thursday.
   Giant, which is controlled by investor Burt Sugarman, said it
was unable to reach final agreement with Environmental Treatment

why the talks faltered.
   The cement companies to be sold were Giant Cement Co. of

   No further explanation was given for collapse of the preliminary
agreement, which originally called for Environmental Treatment to
pay $110 million cash plus warrants allowing Giant to buy
Environmental Treatment stock.
   When the preliminary agreement was announced in mid-May,
Sugarman was waging what turned out to be an unsuccessful proxy
battle for control of Media General Corp. of Richmond, Va.
   There was speculation the sale of the cement companies was
intended to raise cash for Sugarman's offer for Media General stock.

<HEAD>NBC Amends Plans for Putting Business News Program on Cable TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Broadcasting Co. said Thursday it had
decided against buying the cable channel Tempo Television for its
proposed new business news service but plans to lease time on the
channel for the program instead.
   The company, a unit of General Electric Co. that owns the NBC
Television Network, announced last month it had signed a letter of
intent to buy Tempo Television, and would use it for new business
news and sports programming.
   The acquisition was seen as part of NBC President Robert
Wright's oft-stated plans to broaden the broadcasting concern's
business base.
   Tempo Television, a unit of Tempo Enterprises Inc. of Tulsa,
Okla., currently provides outdoors, travel and informational
programming to about 12 million subscribers.
   NBC had planned to acquire the channel from Telecommunications
Inc., a Denver-based cable operator which is in the process of
buying Tempo Enterprises in a deal expected to close in the third
quarter.
   On Thursday, NBC and Telecommunications said they were
restructuring their plans to minimize ``tax and other complications
that arose from trying to separate Tempo Television from its
parent, Tempo Enterprises.''
   Under the new plan, the companies said NBC would lease time on
Tempo Television for a business news service that would run from 6
a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays, starting in early 1989.
   ``Under the new arrangement, NBC will still own and manage the
business news service, but will reach existing Tempo TV subscribers
without actually purchasing Tempo TV,'' the announcement said.
   It said that Tempo Television would try to help the business
news service succeed by paying the first year's affiliation fee on
behalf of all current Tempo TV affiliates who continue to carry
Tempo fulltime after the launch of the business news service.
   John Draper, a spokesman for Telecommunications, said the new
arrangement ``gives NBC the same thing that they were after'' when
it planned to buy the cable channel _ access to a large base of
subscribers.
   He declined to specify how much NBC would pay for the lease. It
had been reported that NBC had agreed to pay about $20 million to
buy the channel.
   The statement did not indicate what the new plans were for
introduction of the proposed sports programing that NBC previously
said it would put on the cable channel.
   John Malone, president of Telecommunications, said in the
statement that his company will ``continue to explore with NBC the
best format for sports and other possible programming for a prime
time and weekend service.''
   A call was placed to NBC officials for elaboration on the
statement but it was not returned.
   Wright was quoted in the statement as saying, ``The cable
industry has been very encouraging and we are enthusiastic about
our plans going forward.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against BN Plan For 2-Man Freight Crews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday blocked Burlington
Northern Railroad Co.'s plan to run freight trains with smaller,
two-member crews across the northern United States.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen sided with union lawyers who
argued that the Interstate Commerce Commission violated the federal
Railway Labor Act when it gave the green light to a BN subsidiary's
plan to use the two-member crews.
   The ICC had given the subsidiary, Winona Bridge Railway Co.,
permission in November to reduce its crews on 1,860 miles of BN
track between Seattle and Winona Junction, Minn.
   Burlington Northern had planned a start-up operation between
Seattle and Spokane, Wash., on May 31.
   Aspen also denied a counter-petition from BN to block threatened
a strike by the unions if the railroad went ahead with its plans.
   The United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers said creation of the two-member crews was an
unlawful attempt to circumvent the provisions of collective
bargaining agreements.
   Under current union contracts, Burlington must maintain a crew
consisting of an engineer, a conductor and one or two brakemen.
   In an effort to reduce its operating costs to compete with other
motor and rail carriers, Burlington sought renegotiation of its
union contracts to eliminate one brakeman from all crews and begin
operating ``expediter trains'' with one engineer and one conductor.
   Last year, the UTU refused to go along with the request for
trains operating between and within Wisconsin and Washington.
   But the ICC exempted the railroad from provisions of the Railway
Labor Act, which requires mandatory bargaining when there is a
unilateral change in working rules and conditions.
   Burlington Northern, however, went ahead with plans to implement
the two-member crews over the Winona route and the unions
threatened to strike if the railroad began the operations. Lawsuits
from both sides followed.
   ``We have no difficulty concluding that the dispute here between
the UTU and Burlington regarding working conditions on trains ...
agreement is a major dispute subject to the mandatory bargaining
and status quo provisions of the RLA,'' Aspen wrote.
   The labor law, first enacted by Congress in 1926, sought to
prevent crippling work stoppages that have plagued the railroad
industry, by forcing parties to resolve their differences through
bargaining.
   Attorneys for BN and the union could not be reached Thursday
night to comment on the ruling. The phone number for union lawyer
Joe Prekop in Cleveland went unanswered, while a recorded message
answered the telephone of BN attorney Roger Campbell.

<HEAD>Companies Continue to Dispute Interpretation of Proxy Vote</HEAD>

   Batus Inc. and Farmers Insurance Group
Inc. each claimed victory Thursday over the interpretation of a
proxy vote on Batus' $4.5 billion hostile takeover bid for the
insurer.
   Farmers released the results of a shareholders' vote on a
resolution urging Farmers management to negotiate with Batus.
   The vote, cast at Farmers' annual meeting May 20, was 27,821,280
in favor of the resolution, 26,809,936 opposed and 2,384,384 shares
abstentions.
   Batus said that with 51 percent of the votes cast, the
resolution passed.
   Farmers maintained, however, that its bylaws require a proposal
to win approval of a majority of shares represented at the meeting
for enactment. That would require counting the abstentions, in
which case it said the resolution would fail with 49 percent.
   The dispute began last week, with the release of preliminary
results of the vote, which was tallied by Corporation Trust Co. of
America in Delaware.
   ``We fully expect that Farmers management will once again try to
assert their preposterous claim that the resolution failed, citing
an irrelevant technicality in their bylaws,'' said Patrick Sheehy,
chairman of Louisville-based Batus, a tobacco and retailing
conglomerate.
   ``Their previous attempt to claim abstentions as votes for
Farmers management is an outright attempt to confuse their own
shareholders. `Abstain' means just that _ those shares were not
voted,'' he said.
   Responded Farmers spokesman Tom Welch: ``If you count the way
the bylaws say then the resolution failed.''
   Batus, a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC of Britain, has been
pressing a $63-a-share offer to Farmers stockholders. Farmers
management is vigorously opposing the bid, both in mailings to
stockholders and in hearings before insurance regulators in several
states.
