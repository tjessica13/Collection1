   Ben Lexcen, designer of the yacht that
ended the United States' 132-year dominance of the America's Cup
competition, died Sunday after a heart attack. He was 52.
   Lexcen's unique winged-keel design enabled Australia II to
defeat the New York Yacht Club defender Liberty, skippered by
Dennis Conner, and win the cup off Newport, R.I., in 1983.
   The United States won back the America's Cup in 1987 when Conner
skippered Stars & Stripes past defender Kookaburra, which was not
designed by Lexcen.
   Last month, Lexcen unveiled a winged skateboard he predicted
would boost the popularity of that activity.

   Robert Henry Hinckley, a co-founder of ABC and
an administrator under Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, died
Saturday at age 96.
   Hinckley, an automobile dealer, began his political climb as a
state legislator and mayor of Mount Pleasant.
   During the Depression, he was Utah director and Western regional
director of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. In 1935,
he was appointed assistant administrator of the Works Progress
Administration.
   Hinckley became chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Authority,
forerunner to the FAA, a year after its creation in 1938. A
promoter of commercial aviation, he was instrumental in the
construction of National Airport in Washington.
   Roosevelt moved him to the Commerce Department in 1940, where he
served as assistant secretary.
   Under Truman he directed the Office of Contract Settlements,
negotiating settlements to defense contracts no longer needed in
peacetime.
   Hinckley took part in the formation of the American Broadcasting
Cos. in 1946, when national television was only a dream. He became
vice president in charge of ABC's Washington, D.C., office,
retiring in 1959. He remained on the board of directors.

   Metropolitan Opera tenor James McCracken,
acclaimed internationally for his singing of the title role in
Verdi's ``Otello,'' died Friday of complications from a stroke. He
was 61.
   McCracken was believed to have sung ``Otello'' more often than
any tenor in history. His dark-timbered tenor and emotional
intensity were thought by critics to be well suited to the long and
difficult role.
   McCracken was born in Gary, Ind., and served in the Navy. With
the help of the GI Bill, he studied music at Columbia University.
   His opera debut was as Rodolfo in ``La Boheme'' at the Central
City, Colo., Opera in 1952. His Met debut was in a small role in
``La Boheme'' in 1953.
   McCracken leapt into operatic prominence in 1960 when he sang
``Otello'' to great acclaim in Washington, D.C.; Zurich,
Switzerland, and Vienna, Austria.
   He returned to the Met in triumph in 1963, becoming the first
American native to sing ``Otello'' at the hall. In the 1970s he
sang at the Met in ``Aida,'' ``Carmen,'' ``Otello'' twice, ``Le
Prophete'' and ``Tannhauser.''

   In 1984, he was considered a possible running mate for Walter
Mondale and was given several roles within the national Democratic
Party and the National Governors Association, traveling to
Washington and elsewhere promoting his jobs-for-welfare recipients
program and his tax collection ideas. His peers designated him the
nation's most effective governor.
   His willingness to make deals and a good sense of timing were
serving him well.
   Dukakis, who had vetoed a 1984 tax cut, signed several tax
reductions in the next three years, even a repeal of the tax
surcharge that remained in place from his first term.
   He won a third term in 1986 with nearly 70 percent of the vote.
Now he boasts that he has experience ``mopping up Republican red
ink'' while cutting taxes.
   The assertion draws mixed reviews back home.
   ``I saw his ads in Pennsylvania when I was home visiting,'' said
Barbara Anderson, executive director of an anti-tax lobby called
Citizens for Limited Taxation. ``Those people out there don't know
that he was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts. The
reputation is a fabricated myth.''
   Linsky and Boston Democratic political consultant Michael
Goldman disagree.
   ``He did sign those tax cuts and he can say that,'' said Linsky.
``He doesn't say he proposed them.''
   ``Anything is fair play in the political arena,'' said Goldman.
``Politicians get more blame than they deserve for some things and
they also tend to get more credit than they deserve for others.''
   Still, some projections say spending will have to be rolled back
or the state could face a $200 million deficit by the end of the
current fiscal year.
   ``I think many people who are familiar with financial management
are laughing when people say our state is in great fiscal shape,''
said Alexander Tennant, executive director of the state Republican
Party.
   The GOP and Anderson blame Dukakis for the new budget crunch,
saying he should have put money aside instead of increasing state
spending by nearly $1 billion a year since returning to office. Yet
they also mounted much of the pressure that led to the tax cuts.
   ``Anyone can manage on a billion-dollar-a-year increase,'' said
Anderson. ``Wait until the miracle worker is facing the national
deficit. He'll do what he's done before, cut services and raise
taxes.''
   But that first term was a long time ago. Massachusetts is a
different state and Dukakis a different politician.
   Despite facing token Republican opposition in 1986, he
campaigned hard, mindful of 1978 and perhaps with an eye on
national exposure, beginning with his neighbors to the north, hosts
of the all-important New Hampshire presidential primary.
   He had said little during his first term while construction was
under way at New Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear power plant just over
the Massachusetts border. But he became a loud critic in recent
years.
   Dukakis now refuses to submit federally required evacuation
plans for Massachusetts towns near Seabrook, blocking the plant
from opening. Polls show a majority of New Hampshire residents
oppose Seabrook.
   Dukakis later began to criticize the troubled Pilgrim nuclear
power plant in his own state. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
considers it one of the nation's worst.
   The plant has been closed on the NRC's orders for two years and
Dukakis has demanded that state officials be permitted to question
managers about safety issues before the plant can be reopened.
   Shortly after being elected to his current term, Dukakis
introduced the health care measure, a first-in-the nation proposal
that guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by 1992.
He was so eager to get the idea enacted into law that his original
bill was derided by both parties as poorly conceived and had to be
completely reworked.
   Dukakis touts the plan as a national model, but critics say it
will not work in states without a strong economy.
   The governor generally is considered a good manager, but several
incidents involving subordinates have stirred doubts.
   He was shaken early in his presidential campaign when it came
out that his top aide, John Sasso, had leaked to reporters a
videotape showing that one of Dukakis' rival in the presidential
campaign, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, had used the words and
sentiments of a British politician as though they were his own. The
disclosure forced Biden out of the presidential race.
   Dukakis, who had said he disliked negative campaigning, said his
campaign had not been responsible for the leak.
   Later Sasso owned up to his role _ showing that Dukakis had been
kept in the dark by his closest adviser on an explosive issue. At
first, Dukakis said he would not fire Sasso; then he reluctantly
accepted his resignation.
   In another incident, a longtime Dukakis campaign organizer
appointed president at Bridgewater State College pleaded guilty
this month to diverting $80,000 in federal money for personal use
while he was in charge of the state's adult education program.
   And in 1986 it was disclosed that high state officials
authorized a $10,000 payment to a student who had accused the
president of Westfield State College of sexually assaulting him.
   Linsky believes voters consider Dukakis personally above
reproach in these incidents because of his role as a reformist
legislator in the 1960s and the ``Mr. Clean'' public image he has
created by his family man approach to his work.
   ``In that sense he's like (President) Reagan, not in the
`Teflon' sense but in the sense that he himself has a great deal of
integrity and that he is very comfortable with himself, not a
person who goes around conveying a lot of self-doubt,'' said Linksy.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan called it ``a little homework
assignment.''
   Prepare a report, he told his education secretary, William J.
Bennett, assessing the progress of school reform five years after a
national commission warned in its landmark study ``A Nation at
Risk'' of a ``rising tide of mediocrity.''
   The resulting 60-page report, ``American Education: Making It
Work,'' issued last week at a White House ceremony, turned out to
be more than Bennett's not-so-fond look at what schools have and
have not accomplished since reform began in earnest in 1983.
   Try as it might to appear otherwise, and it's not clear that it
tried all that hard, this ``little homework assignment'' is now
being read for its political as well as educational content, coming
as it does in the midst of the presidential primary season.
   The barbs start immediately, in the introduction signed by
Bennett.
   Schools are ``slightly improved'' from 1983, said Bennett. But
``we are still at risk. The absolute level at which our
improvements are taking place is unacceptably low'' _ a conclusion
few quarreled with last week.
   However, in explaining why reform has not progressed quickly,
the education secretary took aim at those practicing what he called
``opposition by extortion, the false claim that to fix our schools
will first require a fortune in new funding.''
   He said that ``narrow, self-interested'' parties are too often
succeeding in blocking changes by legislatures and school boards
   ``Teacher unions'' blocked reform by going to court in
Louisiana. Under ``teacher union pressure,'' Texas eliminated key
sections of that state's teacher competency test. Alabama, facing
opposition from administrators and ``the teacher union,'' abandoned
its career ladder program.
   Now who, exactly, might Bennett have been talking about?
   Hint: The National Education Association was one of the only
major education groups not invited to the White House ceremony last
week. NEA activists instead protested at a nearby park.
   The oblique way Bennett repeated his old charge that ``special
interests'' (and we all know which party they dominate) and a
certain teacher union in particular, are big spenders and
half-hearted reformers sounded a bit like the old Archie Bunker
quip: ``I ain't mentioning names. I just look at the party and
whistle.''
   The Bennett report, then, could wind up sharpening the battle
lines between rival approaches to education reform in this
political year.
   To the extent that it foreshadows its party's platform on
education, the Reagan administration is saying here that we could
have had better schools by now. We know how to do it. We know what
works. The answer is not more money and new federal programs. The
problem is lack of political willpower and guts to face down the
``special interests'' who slow reform because it threatens their
stranglehold on schools.
   Teacher unions and others in the educational community replied
last week that the Republican position as stated in the Bennett
report is just further proof that the Reagan administration offered
years of talk but not much action and certainly not much federal
support for school reform.
   It's conceivable that the Democrats will echo those sentiments
in their platform.
   In his weekly paid column scheduled for publication in Sunday's
New York Times, American Federation of Teachers president Albert
Shanker wrote an ``open letter'' to Bennett bitterly criticizing
his report, especially on the money issue.
   Of course better schools aren't ``only a matter of money,'' said
Shanker. ``But you lose credibility every time you repeat that
statement. After all, families that have more money do move to and
live in districts that spend more on their schools. They seem to
know that money does make a difference.''
   And he voiced frustration over Bennett's constant barbs at
teachers and others in the education field.
   ``Instead of leading your troops, you kept shooting at them, as
though all who disagreed with you were misguided,'' Shanker said.
   The Bennett report was silent on the federal role in education,
a fact criticized last week not just by teacher unions and school
interest groups, but by, among others, University of California
President David Gardner who chaired the national commission that
produced ``A Nation at Risk.''
   Given the political bent of this latest report, practically no
one was expressing the belief last week that it would have the
spectacular impact that ``A Nation at Risk'' had five years ago in
rallying support for, and defining the direction of, school reform.

<TEXT>
   Barbed wire and watchtowers ring this
communal farm on the Lebanese border to fend off attacks by Arab
guerrillas, but the heavy security can't keep out the fear.
   ``The tension is growing,'' resident Yossi Tal said after two
separate raids last week by Palestinian guerrillas on
hostage-taking missions.
   But Tal and other kibbutzniks say decades of Syrian shelling,
rocket attacks from Lebanon and guerrilla raids have deepened their
resolve to stay put.
   ``I feel that because of what I went through in my childhood,
I'm more connected to this place,'' said the 38-year-old Tal,
speaking in his sunlit garden apartment as he hugged his 1-year-old
daughter.
   Added his wife, Esti, 38: ``When it gets too difficult, I
sometimes think about leaving. But it's important that we live
here, because we must show that we can't be run out of our
country.''
   In the past five months, however, her commitment was sorely
tested as Arab guerrillas stepped up border raids to keep up
momentum of a Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The latest infiltrations may also stem in part from the
assassination of Khalil Wazir, the military commander of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, who was gunned down April 16 at
his home in Tunisia.
   Kibbutz Dan is in Israel's northeastern tip, one of the most
vulnerable areas along the border. Infiltrators passing through
south Lebanon to reach the border encounter few hostile Lebanese
militias, and the rocky mountain terrain provides good cover.
   In separate raids Tuesday and Wednesday, Palestinian guerrilla
squads with automatic rifles, hand grenades and maps of border
settlements sneaked past Israeli patrols and descended the steep
slopes of Mount Dov two miles east of Dan.
   In Tuesday's pre-dawn infiltration, three guerrillas hiding in a
thicket of bushes on the mountain killed two Israeli soldiers
before troops gunned them down.
   On Wednesday, two guerrillas ambushed an Israeli truck driving
up Mount Dov and wounded the driver. They fled, and hundreds of
foot patrols, backed by helicopter gunships, searched for more than
three hours before spotting them in a ravine and killing them.
   In both cases, Dan and its 550 residents went on red alert.
   ``Tiger Three, Tiger Three,'' shouted a voice over the kibbutz
loudspeakers, telling residents through the codeword that
guerrillas were nearby.
   ``We were in the dining hall eating lunch when the word came,''
said Robert Andersson, 21, a volunteer from the Swedish island of
Orust. ``Everybody was running out.''
   The men grabbed submachine guns and dashed to assigned guard
posts and watchtowers along the barbed wire fence, while others
circled the kibbutz in jeeps. The women stayed indoors with
children.
   ``We went to our rooms and locked the doors,'' said Hagit Bal,
15. ``We heard very heavy shooting, a lot of helicopters.''
   Hagit, a soft-spoken teen-ager with a blond ponytail, said she
hates the guerrillas ``because they hate us and want to kill us.''
   ``When I was little, I used to have nightmares that they would
come ... and shoot us,'' she said. The figures in her dreams were
``dark and ugly, with a moustache.''
   Tal's teen-age son, Yoni, who was born during the 1973 Golan
Heights war, said he used to spend weeks at a time in underground
shelters while guerrillas from Lebanon bombarded the northern
Israeli settlements with Soviet-made Katyusha rockets.
   ``Our nurses would tell us our fathers were fighting for us, but
I was afraid something would happen to them,'' said Yoni, a New
Wave music fan sporting a rat's tail hair cut.
   ``I know that my children have to suffer this tension,'' said
Tal, who was born in Dan. ``And my grandchildren probably will go
through the same thing, and also my great-grandchildren.''
   He recalled that before the 1967 Middle East war, the Syrian
border was only 500 yards from Dan, and trenches five feet deep
criss-crossed the kibbutz as a protection against Syrian shelling.
   ``I remember one day in 1964 when they fired more than 300
shells in two hours,'' said Tal. ``Nobody was hurt, but the place
was devastated.''
   A day after Wednesday's guerrilla infiltration, life was back to
normal in Dan. Farmers donned gray and blue work uniforms and
returned to their apple orchards, trout ponds and honey bee hives.
Children rode bicycles along tree-lined paths linking neatly kept
white garden apartments.
   Meir Dayan, 21, who stood near the communal dining hall with an
Uzi submachine gun resting on his shoulder, said kibbutzniks have
learned to quickly pick up their routine after each alert.
   ``This,'' he said, ``is our way of life.''

   The debate in Washington over a bill requiring a
company to give 60 days' notice before closing a plant puzzles
people in Europe, where such measures are woven into the fiber of
national welfare systems.
   ``I can't remember the subject being discussed in the 10 years
I've been working here,'' said Keith Faulkner, spokesman for the
Trades Union Congress, the umbrella movement of British organized
labor.
   ``I don't see what's the big deal,'' remarked French economist
Bernard Ewenczyk, a specialist in company bankruptcy law. ``It's
not an issue here.''
   Washington has debated a clause in the trade bill that would
require many employers to give workers and local authorities 60
days' notice of plans to close a plant or lay off large numbers of
people.
   President Reagan promised to veto the bill, which was passed by
Congress. He and pro-business lobbies say the bill would lead to
government interference in the market and hamper competitiveness in
world trade.
   But union and management representatives in several European
countries sounded surprised that anyone would deny workers the
right to be notified that they will lose their jobs.
   Even in Britain, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is busy
stamping her free-market, ant-union doctrines into the social
fabric, at least 90 days' closure notice must be given by a plant
employing 100 or more people. For workforces numbering between 10
and 99, 30 days is needed.
   ``This notice is obligatory all over Europe,'' said Carlos
Liebana, a spokesman for the European Economic Community's social
affairs commission. ``It's a very common thing. ... It can be 30,
60 or 90 days, but the principle of giving notice is universal.''
   West Germany and France do not set specific periods for
notification, but their procedures are so complex that a company
seeking to close down can expect to wait months to shut the gates.
   The same goes for Sweden, where ``even the most clear cases will
take months,'' said Jan Nordin, a senior Employers' Federation
official.
   Martin Oertel, a spokesman for IG Metal, West Germany's largest
union, said: ``It would be inconceivable for someone to simply
close a plant here. It would be seen as anti-social and inhuman.
   ``No major action could be taken here without the relevant
unions' knowledge and cooperation.''
   In July 1986, the Michelin tire giant closed its Belgian plant
without warning as two out of three shifts were away on summer
vacation.
   The reaction was universally vehement. Workers occupied the
plant and authorities pressed Michelin to keep it in operation.
Michelin refused but compensated every worker with at least six
months' pay.
   Such compensation is fairly normal in Europe. In France, for
instance, laid-off workers get 75 percent of their gross salary for
14 months, and for another 14 months if they can prove they have
looked hard for another job.
   The money comes out of the social security fund, and this, says
Ewenczyk, is the real problem. In times of high unemployment, the
social security fund can't cope with the drain.
   In the past, French companies had to justify closings before
shutting down, and the bureaucratic tangle could be crippling.
   Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's conservative government has made
attempts to help smaller businesses by doing away with that
requirement for workforces numbering under 10 workers, and Britain
has enacted a similar change.
   But Chirac has introduced a new rule: companies closing plants
have to train workers for other jobs or help them open their own
businesses.
   ``The situation in the United States is much rougher,'' Ewenczyk
said. ``Here it is felt that if a company has to close, it has some
responsibility (to its workers). ... It's a very European point of
view.''
   In Britain, the opposition Labor Party has outlined a demand for
companies not only to notify workers of a closing but to justify it
to an independent body.
   But among various groups questioned, none expressed any
dissatisfaction with the existing laws on notification.
   In Paris, a spokesman for the French Federation of Workers said
the union was relatively happy with the present situation.
   ``What is happening in the United States is the reaction of a
conservative economic policy that does not give proper
consideration to workers,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

   A police officer who abandoned his post
and returned home to help his family during an August flood was
fired Saturday by the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners.
   The three-member panel earlier had found Patrolman Clifford
Launius guilty of eight of nine charges of misconduct.
   Joseph Kozenczak, the chief of police in this northwest Chicago
suburb, sought the dismissal shortly after Launius left his post
without permission. Launius said he feared for the safety of his
family when nine inches of rain hit the area, causing severe
flooding.
   The 3-0 vote came at the end of a nearly three-hour meeting,
said commissioner Herman Herzog.
   ``No decision is easy when you have to remove a man from his
job,'' he said.
   The decision to fire Launius went into effect immediately, but
Launius could appeal in Circuit Court, Herzog said.
   Launius said following the vote that he had no regrets.
   ``I felt that my family was in danger,'' he said. ``I hope to
God I never have to make that kind of decision. ... It wasn't
easy,'' Launius said, adding that he plans to appeal.
   Launius had been suspended without pay since late summer.

   Jesse Jackson and George Bush found themselves in an unlikely
political alliance Saturday as both attacked Democratic
presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis, with Jackson saying he's
too conservative and Bush saying he's not tough enough.
   Dukakis, who avoided any mention of his rivals during a day of
campaigning in Ohio and Indiana, responded to Bush's charges by
suggesting that ``maybe it's time for him to stop criticizing
others.''
   In answer to Jackson's criticisms, the Massachusetts governor
cited his state's economic record as an example of his strong
leadership ability.
   In another development, The Washington Post reported in its
Sunday editions that testimony and documents from a private lawsuit
portray top aides to Bush as being more actively involved in
Central American counterinsurgency planning from 1983 to 1986 than
previously disclosed.
   The information, however, does not contradict assertions by
senior advisers Donald P. Gregg and Col. Samuel J. Watson III that
they were unaware until August 1986 of the plan to resupply the
Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on U.S. aid, the newspaper said.
   Dukakis spent the day pleading with supporters in both states to
avoid the overconfidence that may come from his wide lead over
Jackson for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``I want to ask you once again to do everything you can, on
those phone banks, in your neighborhoods, with your friends and
co-workers, to make sure the people are taking this primary
seriously, that they know it is important,'' Dukakis said in
Cincinnati.
   Dukakis is heavily favored to win Tuesday's primaries in Ohio
and Indiana and has built up a 424-delegate lead over Jackson as
the two campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Dukakis leads Jackson by a ratio of more than 2{-1 and has
increased his lead over Jackson in the last month, according to a
poll published in Sunday's editions of The Columbus Dispatch.
   The poll showed Dukakis was the favorite among 62 percent of the
1,974 registered Democrats who responded to the statewide poll,
while Jackson was the choice of 24 percent.
   The newspaper conducted its poll by mail Monday through
Thursday. It has an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent on each result.
   The April poll compared with a poll the newspaper conducted in
March that showed Dukakis leading Jackson 50 percent to 23 percent.
   Dukakis was the choice of 62 percent of the Democrats likely to
vote in Ohio's primary, according to a statewide poll conducted by
the University of Akron.
   The poll, paid for by the Akron Beacon Journal and television
stations WCMH in Columbus and WKYC in Cleveland, found that Jackson
had the support of 22 percent.
   The telephone survey was based on telephone interviews with 926
registered Ohio voters between April 20 and Saturday. It had a
margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
   While optimistic of his prospects in Ohio and Indiana, Dukakis
warned his supporters that overconfidence contributed to his 1978
defeat when he ran for re-election as governor of Massachusetts.
   ``It was the most painful experience of my life,'' Dukakis told
workers in Cleveland.
   Bush, who also was campaigning in Ohio even though he has a
mathematical lock on the Republican presidential nomination, called
for the death penalty for ``drug kingpins'' and said that both
Jackson and Dukakis lack his toughness on this issue.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson oppose capital punishment.
   ``We've appointed tougher judges. We are getting more
convictions and longer sentences. But where are the Democrats on
mandatory sentencing, on tougher penalties for those who poison our
kids with drugs? I favor the death penalty for drug kingpins, those
involved in drug-related killings,'' he said.
   ``If Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are serious about this,
let's see where they stand on throwing the book at those who are
poisoning the lives of the young people.''
   Jackson criticized Dukakis for not going far enough in
committing himself to spend money on such issues as child care,
southern Africa, education, and drugs.
   ``We need a massive commitment to invest in people, reinvest in
America and end Reaganomics,'' Jackson said at a rally in Columbus.
   He criticized Dukakis for offering $250 million in new education
spending saying, ``You cannot educate every child in America to go
to college on only $250 million.''
   However, Jackson stopped short of saying that Dukakis would try
to pull Democrats toward Republican policies.
   ``I would not put him in that category,'' he said. ``There are
some in the Democratic Party who would pull our party toward
conservatism.''
   Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk said Jackson's charges that
Dukakis doesn't offer an alternative to Republicans didn't cross
the line into negative campaigning.
   ``In any primary, in any contest, you have to have a healthy
clash of ideas,'' said Kirk, who attended a party fund-raiser in
Indianapolis. ``... But that's a long way from maligning or
smearing a candidate or having inaccuracies about the issues or the
record.''
   Later, at a rally on the University of Dayton campus, Jackson
suggested that Dukakis was a managerial candidate, while he is a
leader. The preacher-turn-politician said attainment of peace in
the world and altering President Reagan's economic policy requires
leadership, not management.
   ``To end Reaganomics, we need a leader. We need to change the
course,'' Jackson told the cheering, racially mixed crowd at the
Ohio school. ``To find peace in the Middle East, we must have
leadership. We cannot manage apartheid, we must end apartheid.''
   Dukakis, during a campaign stop in Indianapolis, defended
himself against Jackson's criticisms, saying, ``When it comes to
leadership, I'm very proud of the fact that I'm governor of a state
which is generally viewed to be a state that's way out front ... My
kind of leadership is as a doer and not a talker.''
   In response to Bush's charges, Dukakis said: ``I think maybe
it's time for him to stop criticizing others and to begin to
address some fundamental issues that face this country.''
   Bush also renewed his counterattack on the issue of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, who is the subject of a number of
investigations by an independent counsel. Democrats have cited
Meese as evidence of a ``sleaze factor'' in the Reagan
administration that will be an issue in the fall campaign.
   ``I've heard Dukakis and Jackson talk about sleaze. What are
they talking about? Who are they talking about?'' said Bush. ``Are
they convicting someone before the system works?''
   Bush warned that if the Democrats ``want to go down the low
road, we'll meet them.''

said.
   ``I don't have any specifics, but there has been an incident at

   Pentagon spokesman Maj. Kathy Wood said there had been a report
of an auto accident but that the Defense Department had no details
and no confirmation of deaths.

<TEXT>
   An aging Navy nuclear-powered attack
submarine was freed largely unscathed early Saturday after going
aground in sand and gravel off Fox Island in south Puget Sound,
Navy officials said.
   ``There was no internal damage and the hull was not damaged,''
said Petty Officer 2nd Class Mike Kriesel, following an initial
investigation.
   The USS Sam Houston was moored to a Navy barge in Carr Inlet,
about one-half mile from where it went aground south of Tacoma, for
about half a day of further checks by divers and other personnel.
   ``The only damage they found was to some external equipment that
was put on the ship for sound testing,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Kathy
Woodcock at the Trident nuclear submarine base at Bangor.
   The sub, which was pulled free by four Navy tugs on a rising
tide at 4:18 a.m. Saturday, was towed to Bangor late Saturday
night, she said. She added that she did not know why it was towed,
rather than moving under its own power, and would not have further
word on the vessel before Monday.
   The Ethan Allen-class sub, based at Pearl Harbor, was grounded
around 6 p.m. Friday on Carr Inlet about 100 yards off the
southeast end of Fox Island, with the tide going out, said Navy
spokesman Fred Watson at the Bangor base.
   No one was injured, and the sub's 142 crew members remained
aboard.
   ``She wasn't that far dug in,'' Watson said of the stuck sub. As
an attack sub, said Watson, the vessel carried no missiles.
   A small crowd of residents and reporters gathered on the beach
of the residential island south of Tacoma to look at the sub Friday
night.
   ``I looked down the beach and saw this nuclear-powered whale
beached,'' said Dr. John West, a Fox Island resident.
   A sonar pod beneath the sub was visible as the tide went out,
and ``the water was way underneath the water line,'' said Steve
Collins, 41, a resident of the island. ``It's an amazing sight.''
   The tugs were assisted by the submarine rescue ship USS
Florikan. The 410-foot-long Sam Houston sustained minor damage to
exterior hull equipment and will undergo repairs at Bangor before
continuing operations, Watson said.
   The Navy would not disclose how the ship grounded; Watson said
an investigation was under way. The sub was commanded by Cmdr.
Phillip J. Kuehlen, who was not immediately available for comment,
Watson said.
   The sub was in Carr Inlet, where the water is about 350 feet
deep, for testing to determine how quiet it is in the water, Watson
said. The Navy regularly tests submarine acoustics in the area.
   About 15 minutes before the grounding, West said he noticed ``a
lot of smoke from the sub, and they dove under the water,
presumably on a routine measure.'' About 15 minutes later, Navy men
in T-shirts rushed to the beach, and West said he then saw the sub
was grounded.
   Jim Saathoff, another island resident, said he had seen the
submarine moving ``at a pretty good clip'' beneath the water with
its scope up and then, ``for whatever reason, it turned toward the
beach.''
   The bow of the sub was completely exposed where it ran aground
on a gradually sloping, sandy beach, said Saathoff.
   The Sam Houston was launched in February 1961 at Newport News,
Va., and commissioned 13 months later.
   Watson said the 250-foot Florikan, specially equipped for
assisting submarines in trouble, happened to be in Puget Sound for
crew rest and relaxation and recalibration of instruments. Like the
Sam Houston, the Florikan's home port is Pearl Harbor.

   A gas stove exploded and started a
pre-dawn apartment building fire Sunday that trapped and killed 10
people, including four children, police said.
   Investigators believe the stove exploded in the apartment of a
retired police officer in Cebu City. The officer and his wife were
among those killed, they said.
   The other fatalities included two families who also lived in the
building in the crowded Mambaling district of the city, which is
360 miles southeast of Manila.
   Most Philippine houses and apartments have iron grills over
windows to protect against burglars, but the grills stop people
from using windows to leave their apartments in an emergency.
Firefighters blame the grills for most fire deaths in the country.
   Firefighters said five other houses were destroyed or damaged by
the fire.

   A senior North Korean intelligence
official sought political asylum here Sunday in what local reports
called the highest-ranking defection to the South since the end of
the Korean War.
   The Foreign Ministry said Kim Jeong Min, 45, arrived in Seoul
Sunday after his defection in a South Korean embassy in Europe. The
ministry would not say exactly where or when he defected.
   Kim, who had been carrying a North Korean diplomatic passport,
sought political asylum while he was traveling in ``a certain
European country on official business,'' it said.
   Kim had been a senior official in North Korea's Ministry of
Public Security, a powerful intelligence organization, the ministry
said without elaborating.
   Local press reports said Kim would be the highest-ranking North
Korean government offical to defect to South Korea since the end of
the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap said Kim arrived in Seoul on a
Korean Air flight from Bangkok, Thailand, early Sunday, but details
of his flight were not released.
   Kim ignored a flurry of questions by reporters as South Korean
officials escorted him through the airport into a car. Officials
said he would be detained for questioning.
   Ministry officials said Kim wanted asylum in Seoul and the
government had honored his request ``out of humanitarian concern
and according to international practices.
   South Korean authorities ``will conduct through investigations
into the backgound, true motive and other circumstances surrounding
Mr. Kim's defection and will make an official announcement on the
result of the investigation in due course,'' a ministry statement
said.

   Western ambassadors attended May Day celebrations
in Moscow Sunday for the first time since the 1979 Soviet drive
into Afghanistan and saw a parade strikingly free of the strident
anti-American rhetoric of the past.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev led 11 other Politburo
members onto the masoleum where the body of Soviet founder Vladimir
I. Lenin lies to view the festivities marking the workers holiday,
one of the most important dates in the Soviet calendar.
   For two hours, Muscovites carrying banners and towing floats
extolling ``perestroika'' (reconstruction) ``glasnost'' (openness),
worldwide nuclear disarmament and other Communist Party programs
strolled past the massed Kremlin leadership and across sun-dappled
Red Square.
   One float demanded ``freedom for the people of South Africa,''
but few dealt with international affairs in detail, beyond calling
for peace and disarmament.
   One large float stressed the need for good superpower relations,
depicting a handshake against the background of the U.S. and Soviet
flags with the inscription ``Da!''
   During the kickoff of the parade, Gorbachev had an animated
conversation with party ideologue Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2
Kremlin leader who some reports say recently had a falling-out with
Gorbachev.
   U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock made the first appearance by an
American ambassador at May Day since 1980, when the United States
began boycotting the ceremony to protest the Kremlin's armed
intervention in Afghanistan.
   ``I'm here first of all since this is not a military-related
holiday and because the agreements have been signed in Geneva,'
said Matlock, referring to accords signed in the Swiss city last
month that mandate a pullout of the 115,000 Soviet troops from
Afghanistan beginning May 15.
   ``Our president is due in less than a month, and it seems to me
that one should resume normal attendance at non-military events,''
the U.S. ambassador added.
   President Ronald Reagan is due in Moscow on May 29-June 2 for
his fourth summit meeting with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev's wife Raisa, dressed in a long black coat cinched at
the waist and a purple silk scarf fastened with a brooch, told
reporters she was looking forward to the chance to host the Reagans
in Moscow.
   ``We await a new meeting and new acquaintances,'' Mrs. Gorbachev
said, smiling and clasping a bouquet of red carnations wrapped in
plastic.
   Also attending were the West German ambassador, Andreas
Meyer-Landrut, British ambassador Sir Bryan Cartledge, French
ambassador Yves Pagniez, Italian ambassador Sergio Romano and other
top West European envoys.
   The West German ambassador, Andreas Meyer-Landrut said it was
the first time ambassadors from all European Economic Community
countries attended May Day festivities in Moscow since the Soviets
sent tanks and troops into Afghanistan in December 1979.

   Tamil rebels detonated buried
explosives beneath a passenger bus crowded with shoppers Sunday,
killing 22 people and wounding 30 others in northeastern Sri Lanka,
a military official said.
   The death toll initially was given as 15, but officials raised
the figure when rescue workers found more mutilated bodies aboard
the burned-out bus.
   Fifteen of the 30 others were injured critically.
   It occurred at the village of Sittaru, 25 miles southwest of the
eastern port of Trincomalee.
   The military official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, said ``seven bodies are badly mutilated and are beyond
recognition.''
   The victims were airlifted by Sri Lankan air force helicopters
to government hospitals in Anuradhapura to the east of Trincomalee,
the official said.
   He estimated that there were at least 75 villagers on the bus
when the blast occurred.
   Major Jayantha Jayasinghe, contacted by telephone in
Trincomalee, said Sri Lankan troops were being rushed to the area.
Trincomalee is about 150 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Major Jayasinghe said the victims were from the majority
Buddhist Sinhalese and minority Moslem communities.
   Both military officials blamed the Tamil Tigers for the
explosion, the second bus attack in two days.
   Six soldiers and five civilians were killed Saturday when Tamil
rebels ambushed a bus in the town of Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast
of Colombo.
   The rebels are fighting a nearly 5-year-old insurgency to create
a separate Tamil homeland.
   Tamils comprise about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
population. Most Tamils are Hindus and they say they are
discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   Sri Lanka and India signed a peace accord in July that allowed
some Tamil self-rule in the north and east of the island nation,
but the Tamil Tigers rejected the pact and refused to lay down
their weapons.
   More than 50,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka now to enforce
the accord.

   Three British servicemen were
killed and three injured in separate car bomb and shooting
incidents Sunday near the West German border. The Irish Republican
Army claimed responsibility.
   All the servicemen had come from West Germany, where they were
based, to the Netherlands for Saturday festivities surrounding the
official 50th birthday celebration of Queen Beatrix.
   A British Ministry of Defense spokesman who spoke on condition
of anonymity reported the attacks but refused comment on reports
that terrorists were to blame.
   ``We're not saying anything along those lines. ... We're waiting
for the results of investigations by Dutch police and military
authorities,'' he said.
   The IRA, which is fighting to oust Great Britain from Northern
Ireland, claimed responsibility in a coded message to Belfast media.
   It was the first reported attack on Great Britain in the
Netherlands in almost a decade. In 1979, British Ambassador Richard
Sykes was shot to death outside his Hague residence, and the IRA
claimed responsibility.
   In the first incident Sunday, in the southern city of Roermond,
one serviceman was killed and two injured when gunmen fired on
their car at about 1 a.m., officials said.
   Thirty minutes later, in the village of Nieuwbergen, 30 miles to
the north, two servicemen were killed instantly and one was
seriously injured when their British-licensed car exploded as they
were getting into it on the country town's main street, according
to police spokesman Louis Steens.
   ``I heard the bang and ran there straightaway,'' said a man who
was sitting in a nearby cafe.
   ``The car was already on fire. Twenty meters (67 feet) away, a
boy was lying all covered in blood,'' said the bystander, who
refused to give his name.
   ``The bodies were in such condition that they could not
immediately be identified,'' Steens told The Associated Press.
   He said the Dutch Army bomb squad searched the wreckage and the
area for traces of exposives. Another British-licensed car parked
in front of the nearby Bacchus discotheque, where police believe
the three soldiers spent the evening, was also searched, but police
found nothing.
   The Bacchus is heavily frequented by British military personnel,
according to local residents.
   After the explosion, 60 houses in the town were evacuated as a
safety precaution.
   The Ministry of Defense spokesman said the servicemen involved
in the Roermond shooting were based at a Royal Air Force base in
Wildenrath in West Germany.
   The dead man was identified as Senior Aircraftsman Ian Shinner,
20, of Winsford in Cheshire. The two injured men were in a nearby
Dutch hospital and were not immediately identified.
   The Dutch National News Agency reported that their car was
riddled with bullet holes.
   There was no information immediately available on the identities
of the Nieuwbergen blast victims. But TV-AM, Britain's commercial
breakfast television program, said they were from the RAF Laarbruch
base in West Germany, close to Wildenrath.
   Several British military installations are along the Dutch-West
German border, which runs only a few miles east of Nieuwbergen.
   The British command in West Germany issued an alert for all
British military personnel living in The Netherlands or near the
Dutch-West German border, or planning to travel through the
Netherlands.
   The British command ordered the military personnel to check
their cars for explosive devices, according to the British
Broadcasting Corporation.

   A commercial van and a private car
crashed and burned on a U.S. Navy base, killing five sailors and a
civilian, a base spokesman said Sunday.
   The wreck Saturday evening also injured three sailors and a
civilian. Three of them were in critical condition, said base
spokesman Lt. Bob Hines.
   Identities of dead and injured were not immediately available.
``There was fire involved in the accident,'' Hines said. ``It's
making identification (of the bodies) difficult.''
   All the fatalities occurred inside the van, which was operated
by the base's retail exchange. It was more heavily damaged by fire
than the car, Hines said.
   Lt. Cmdr. A. Long, a spokesman for Atlantic Fleet headquarters
in Norfolk, Va., said earlier the accident involved a truck and van.
   Hines said military investigators were looking into how the
accident happened and what caused it. Security personnel did not
witness it, he said.
   About 7,000 people, military personnel and civilian workers,
live on the base at the eastern tip of communist Cuba. The
facility, which is enclosed and surrounded by a minefield, serves
as the main training site for the Atlantic Fleet.

   Several Italians who were prisoners of
war in Texas have returned to embrace as friends the people they
once considered their enemy.
   More than 100 residents of Deaf Smith and Castro counties
welcomed the 16 former prisoners and their wives who returned for a
visit Saturday to the World War II prisoner of war camp near this
Panhandle community.
   ``It is good to see the same place and remember the years I
lost,'' said Angelo Sacchi, who was 20 when he was captured. ``I
have mostly good memories, particularly with the American nurses,
because I was hospitalized for three months.''
   They visited a chapel they built in 1945 as a monument to five
countrymen who died while at the camp 50 miles southwest of
Amarillo.
   Auelio Manzoni, a former Italian officer, said the prisoners
were glad to come to Texas because prison life here was better than
in France or England.
   ``It is a good thing to remember what was our life for three
years,'' Manzoni said. ``But it was still the life of a prisoner.''
   Clara Vick, a member of Castro County Historical Society, gave
the former POWs a scrap book of newspaper clippings and documents
related to the camp. She also gave each former prisoner a piece of
the camp's barbed wire fence.
   The visitors donated $100 to the Castro County Historical
Commission for restoration of their chapel.
   ``One of the greatest compliments these men have paid us is the
fact that they have returned to visit,'' said the Rev. James Salvi,
who worked at the POW camp during 1943-49.
   The visitors planned to stay in the Panhandle until Monday.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Ethiopian teen-agers reached
Florida after hiding in a cargo ship for two weeks as stowaways and
immediately applied for political asylum.
   ``We're afraid of the wars,'' 14-year-old Mahari Gebremskel said
through an interpreter. He was referring to rebellions that have
been under way for years in two northern provinces against
Ethiopia's Marxist government.
   The boys, ranging in age from 12 to 15, had been hiding among
27,000 130-pound bags of coffee aboard the freighter Galveston Bay.
   David Angotti of the Jacksonville office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service took the unusual step of releasing the boys
Saturday to the temporary custody of Jacksonville residents,
including several Ethiopian couples.
   ``The only reason they're being allowed off the ship is their
age,'' Angotti said, adding that it's unusual for the INS to
receive requests for political asylum from stowaways who are
children.
   ``They want to build a new life,'' said Linda Bellamy , a
volunteer refugee worker for St. Phillips Episcopal Church who
helped find homes for the youths. ``They were brave. In order for
them to come this far there had to be a reason.''
   Steven P. Kapustka , operations manager for Eller & Co., agent
for the Galveston Bay, said he learned the stowaways were on board
last week.
   He said an INS official boarded the Galveston Bay, owned by
Afram Lines of Tampa, on Friday and interviewed the youngsters
while the vessel was anchored off the coast waiting to enter the
St. Johns River channel.
   Jacksonville was the Galveston Bay's first port since leaving
Ethiopia about April 17, Kapustka said.

   Dozens of former Playboy bunnies have showed
they can still throw a good party and aren't slowed down by having
to dye gray hairs and leave their college-age children at home.
   ``They've only gotten prettier,'' said Patty Mennen, 42, who
wore the fluffy tail and tall ears, the costume that was worn from
1965 through 1970 at clubs in Miami and New York.
   For many of the more than 100 who attended the reunion Saturday,
it was the first time they'd seen each other in decades.
   ``You haven't changed a bit,'' squealed Gloria Hendry, a bunny
from 1964 to 1973, when she spotted Ms. Mennen.
   Many of the women are no longer struggling as they were when
they were younger and earning a living by entertaining in their
skin-tight outfits.
   Ms. Hendry, an actress who appeared in a James Bond movie, said
that being a bunny taught her ``how to be a hostess with the
mostest. It taught me how to talk to people.''
   Mona Lisa, 25, a singer, worked in the Empire Playboy Club, part
of an attempt to revive the chain of clubs. It closed in June 1986
after just eight months.
   ``The memory will live on forever,'' she said. ``Times change,
people expect different things.''
   Ms. Mennen, who wore white bunny ears Saturday, remembered
people picketing the old New York club, which closed in 1982.
   ``They said, `How do you do this?' I said, `I'm laughing all the
way to the bank,''' she recalled.
   One of the most popular people at the party was Betty Dozier
Tate of Queens, a seamstress who made bunny outfits beginning in
1961.
   ``These are my kids,'' she said. ``I wish Hugh Hefner had
another nightclub.''
   But Ms. Mennen commented: ``It was just a fad.''
   The reunion was organized by former bunny Anna Lederer, 37, who
left her native Trinidad at 17, earned a degree in international
relations at the University of Geneva and later opened an import
business.
   Mrs. Lederer, who worked from 1968 to 1971 in the old Manhattan
club, arranged the reunion at the suggestion of her 13-year-old son.
   Ms. magazine founder Gloria Steinem, who once took a job as a
bunny to write an expose, said she rejected an invitation to attend
the reunion.
   ``When we have a dinner where former bunnies feel able to tell
the truth, it will make a lot more money. And then I'll come,'' she
said.
   Money raised by the $80 fee for bunnies and their dates and the
$200 for others will benefit Cancer Care Inc.

   Five people were killed and 23 were
injured in ethnic violence in a working class neighborhood of this
port city, reports said Sunday.
   The official English language daily, the Pakistan Times, said
three people died Sunday. Karachi's Dawn newspaper said two other
people died late Saturday from injuries sustained in the violence.
   Officials were unavailable for comment, and government offices
were closed in observance of the May 1 holiday.
   The trouble started Friday night when a traffic accident in
western Karachi led to rioting and gunfire between Pathan youths,
who trace their roots to northern Pakistan, and Mohajirs, who
immigrated from India.
   Karachi, Pakistan's largest city with a population of 7 million,
has been a hotbed of ethnic violence in recent years.
   Hundreds were killed in November and December 1986 when Pathans
and Mohajirs battled in the streets of several neighborhoods.

<TEXT>
   Rail service throughout Taiwan was halted
for the first time in 101 years Sunday when train drivers staged a
one-day strike to press demands for higher wages.
   ``It never happened before in the railway history here. Our
trains even ran during World War II,'' said Chou Chin-sung,
director of the main Taipei railroad station.
   Loudspeakers at the station broadcast apologies to stranded
passengers and urged them to collect refunds on their tickets and
take buses.
   Chou estimated the strike would cost the Taiwan Railway
Administration, which runs most of this island's passenger and
freight services, $1.2 million.
   The trains carry roughly 360,000 passengers on a regular Sunday.
   The Train Drivers Club, which represents 1,500 workers, called
the strike to coincide with the May Day labor holiday. It told
drivers to return to work Monday.
   The drivers work 12 hours a day and earn an average monthly
salary of $700. They want a 10 percent increase.
   The rail administration has offered to increase salaries 4
percent to 8 percent.
   Chang Shou-tsen, director of the railway administration, told
reporters the administration would meet with the strikers to try to
negotiate a settlement.

<HEAD>Yugoslavia Goes on a Shopping Spree in Economic Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavs are entering the final
days of a national shopping binge spurred by fears of huge price
increases when a government freeze ends next month.
   ``The country looks like it is preparing for war,'' said one
shopper last week in a crowded Belgrade supermarket. ``Everybody is
piling up stocks of staples at home.''
   Dragan Petrovic, a manager of a downtown Belgrade supermarket,
said he now sells one ton of sugar, half a ton of coffee and 15,000
bottles of cooking oil every day, which equals normal sales for a
month.
   ``If this shopping spree continues, they will even buy my
counter,'' Petrovic said.
   The middle of May is shaping up as a crucial juncture in
communist Yugoslavia's post-World War II history. The government is
facing a confidence vote, trying to lock up new credits abroad, and
introducing unpopular economic measures at home.
   Vice Premier Janez Zemljaric said recently that Yugoslavia
``faces economic collapse'' unless foreign creditors grant a
financial reprieve.
   Living standards of Yugoslavs have already slipped to mid-1960
levels since 1980, resulting in an unprecedented 150,000 strikes
last year.
   Local media have reported that about 80 percent of the country's
manufacturers have prepared new prices for May 15, when the
government lifts the price freeze. New prices are expected to be 50
percent to 70 percent above current levels.
   The government of Premier Branko Mikulic said it has prepared a
new economic program aimed at defusing the expected price and
inflation explosion.
   However, doubting improvement under Mikulic, the parliament of
Slovenia, the country's most developed region, has started a formal
procedure to unseat the federal government.
   It's the first such move in communist Yugoslavia and is to be
voted on later this month by the nation's five other republics.
   Slovenian officials have bitterly criticized Mikulic and his
administration for failing to curb the 170 percent inflation and
for intervening in the economy.
   Government officials counter that their new program includes
market-oriented measures, expected eventually to curb prices, and
much less state intervention.
   The officials said the new measures were worked out with the
International Monetary Fund, with which Yugoslavia recently reached
a draft one-year agreement expected to be approved May 13. The
program aims to reduce inflation to 95 percent annually by the end
of this year.
   A precondition for the new program are fresh loans and
rescheduling of a large part of the country's $20 billion debt,
government officials said.
   Yugoslavia's creditors, mainly 16 Western governments and
leading commercial banks, have told the country that new Monetary
Fund credit would be a precondition for a fresh refinancing deal
over several years.

<HEAD>Congress May Close Some Unneeded Military Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Searching for new ways to cut federal
spending, Congress may finally be ready to butcher one of its most
sacred cows _ outdated and unneeded military bases.
   ``We no longer need to guard the Pony Express routes to the Wild
West. We no longer need to maintain moated forts to guard against
assault by British sailing ships,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
   ``We all know why these unnecessary bases have been kept open,''
Roth said. ``They have been maintained for selfish political
reasons in order to maintain a flow of defense dollars into our
states. But the budgetary good times are gone. We simply cannot
justify throwing money away.''
   Roth is the chief sponsor of a measure approved last week by the
Senate Armed Services Committee as an amendment to next year's
Pentagon budget bill.
   Roth's proposal would create a nine-member commission, appointed
by the secretary of defense, to look at bases around the country
and recommend, solely on the basis of national security needs,
which ones should be kept open. The secretary would then be free to
implement those recommendations, unless specifically reversed by
Congress.
   The same plan has been introduced in the House by Rep. Richard
K. Armey, R-Texas.
   Both Roth and Armey cite various estimates from previous studies
that closing unneeded bases could save between $2 billion and $5
billion a year.
   Bases mean jobs, and legislators have been loath to see payrolls
cut. In the decades after World War II, the Pentagon was generally
allowed to do as it pleased on the issue, with the exception of a
handful of bases protected by key members of Congress. Between 1961
and 1977, the Defense Department cut or closed 3,600 installations
and saved an estimated $5 billion a year.
   But in 1975, the Air Force proposed shutting down Loring Air
Force Base, a B-52 base in northern Maine that the service said was
unneeded. Maine's congressional delegation succeeded in winning
congressional approval for a new law that required costly _ up to
$1 million each _ environmental studies for any Pentagon attempt to
close a base.
   The studies were also lengthy and gave critics opposed to
shutting a base plenty of ammunition. But requirements for the
studies would be waived under the pending commission proposal.
   Since 1975, no major military installations have been closed. In
1979, the Pentagon proposed mothballing 157 facilities and laying
off 45,000 personnel, but dropped it in the face of congressional
opposition.
   Six years later, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger suggested
22 installations he said could be shut down, but Congress reacted
strongly again and the idea went nowhere.
   Politics cuts both ways, Armey noted. Last year, Republican
congressman said 28 bases could be closed, but 27 of them were in
districts represented in the House by Democrats. In 1986,
Weinberger said three more facilities could be closed, but they
were all in the districts of Democrats critical of Weinberger and
his idea was never seriously considered.
   Last year, Armey lost, 199-192, when he tried to put his base
closure amendment into the Pentagon budget bill.
   But the atmosphere is different this year, partly because of
congressional agreement that the military budget is one of the few
places left to look in the effort to find spending cuts. His plan
now has 112 co-sponsors.
   The chairman of the Senate and House Armed Services committees
suggest that this year's opportunity to close bases is a unique one.
   ``This is probably an area of waste and inefficiency that can be
seized this year, unlike any other year,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., agreed. ``There's a good chance this
year because of a variety of circumstances,'' he said. But ``even
though we've got a lot of people on board on this, there's still a
lot of opposition,'' he added.
   Under the commission plan, the panel would have to make its
recommendations by next Dec. 31 and Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, who supports the idea, would have 15 days to accept or
reject the entire list. That decision would be made only five days
before the Reagan administration leaves office.
   ``You've got a secretary of defense who's willing to make a
choice as he leaves office,'' Aspin said. ``That's a big factor.''
   Armey's plan is not part of the Pentagon budget bill now on the
House floor, but it will be considered separately by the chamber
within the next month, Aspin said.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Naval Hospital Has Survived Several Closing Threats</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Base Closings Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Naval Hospital frequently
appears on the Pentagon's chopping block, but it has escaped the ax
so far.
   The death blow has been postponed at least until completion of
two military studies of medical care in the region.
   In February 1987, then-Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman Jr.
proposed shutting the hospital within eight months and relocating
patients to Walson Army Medical Center at Fort Dix, N.J.
   When Philadelphia-area lawmakers objected, Lehman modified the
plan to allow patients to be treated at a Philadelphia-area
hospital or medical group to be chosen through competitive bidding.
But the hospital was still scheduled to close by Sept. 30.
   However, the hospital did not close, and on Oct. 6, Lehman's
successor, James H. Webb Jr., told a House subcommittee the
shutdown was on hold pending completion of the studies.
   The hospital also survived two earlier closing attempts.
   In February 1986, Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
included the hospital in a list of three installations he said were
unneeded and could be closed to save money. But opposition from
area lawmakers saved it.
   In 1980, the hospital was also in danger of closing. But it
survived then because of the arrival of the aircraft carrier
Saratoga for overhaul at the nearby Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.
   The hospital was built in 1935 and had a daily patient load of
1,000 during the Vietnam War.
   It employed about 820 people in 1986, but just 400 a year later
when Lehman proposed its elimination. By February 1987, its daily
patient load was just 50.

<HEAD>Colorado Politicians Fought Off Move To Close Lowry Air Base</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Base Closings Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger
proposed closing Lowry Air Force Base two years ago, Colorado
politicians and business leaders banded together to thwart the
effort.
   The base was one of three military installations that Weinberger
suggested should be closed in a test of Congress' willingness to
save money.
   The Lowry center, with an annual payroll of $187 million,
originally was an Army Air Corps base used during World War II to
train B-29 bomber crews. It now employs 4,350 military personnel
and 2,900 civilians and provides training in avionics, munitions
and intelligence to about 3,900 students.
   Real estate developers were excited at the prospect of such
prime real estate as Lowry, surrounded by residential areas and
businesses, being opened for development. They said the property
was worth $170 million.
   But Denver-area business and government leaders said the plan
would pull $867 million from the economy.
   In a rare show of bipartisan action, Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., and Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., fired off letters to
Weinberger demanding further explanation.
   Other Colorado congressmen asked for an investigation by the
House Armed Services Committee, and then-Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo.,
accused Weinberger of playing politics by singling out bases for
closure in the districts of outspoken defense critics, such as
Schroeder.
   In January 1987, the Pentagon sent a three-paragraph letter to
the Senate Armed Services Committee saying Lowry would remain open.

<TEXT>
   Loring Air Force Base may be tucked away
in the northern Maine woods, but its existence has not been hidden
from officials in Washington, who have slashed costs and tried to
close the facility many times.
   The Strategic Air Command Base was hit by several reductions
during the early 1970s. Presidents Ford and Carter tried to phase
out the base in the late '70s because of fears its proximity to the
Atlantic would make it vulnerable to submarine-launched ballistic
missiles.
   But the Pentagon backed down after Maine's congressional
delegation and a ``Save Loring Committee'' successfully argued that
poor, rural Aroostook County would be economically devastated by
the loss of the base.
   Since then, the military has spent about $150 million to
renovate the 2,000-acre base, prompting Rep. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, to say in 1984 that that spending indicated the Air
Force's ``long-range intentions toward Loring.''
   And in recent years, the base has been called valuable for its
strategic location to Canada and because it is the closest Air
Force base in the continental United States to the Soviet Union.
   Loring was carved out of a virgin forest hard by the New
Brunswick, Canada, border following World War II. It currently
employs 3,760 military and 564 civilian personnel and assigns its
pilots to fly B-52 bombers and KC-135 jets.

   After a quarter-century of taking
contraceptives and birth-control information to developing nations,
a major medical center is finding that the way you deal with people
is as important as the technology you bring them.
   ``Twenty-five years of experience, and a lot of research in
health care, generally have shown that clients tend to forget about
half of what they're told in a clinic,'' Dr. Phyllis T. Piotrow of
the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health said.
   In the past, efforts to extend family planning to developing
nations have focused on technical and clinical materials and
information, she said in an interview.
   ``But we're realizing more and more that if a good rapport isn't
established with a client, these programs are not going to work.''
   ``Organizations around the world are beginning to recognize that
this is a big problem,'' she said. So ``the moment is right to
focus not only on what we say, but how we say it.''
   Health workers are being taught to treat clients as equals, to
ask questions that draw out more information, to speak in native
languages, to use more respectful forms of address, to let the
client ask questions and many other approaches, Piotrow said.
   To help in the effort, Johns Hopkins in the past month has
mailed out some 150,000 copies of a special issue of its
international journal, ``Population Reports,'' concentrating on
counseling.
   In addition, special counseling seminars have been held in Egypt
and programs are being scheduled in such countries as Ghana,
Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, Mali, Zaire, India, Brazil, Mexico and
Peru, among others.
   Piotrow's counseling program is getting under way even as the
independent Population Reference Bureau reports that world
population is growing faster than expected.
   Current growth of 1.7 percent annually means the world could
double its current 5 billion total in just 40 years, the Bureau
reported. Anticipated declines in the growth rates in many less
developed nations have not occurred as rapidly as hoped, the Bureau
said.
   ``At this stage ... better communication probably will make more
difference now than any other single factor in these programs,''
she said.
   The federal Agency for International Development, which supports
her work, places heavy emphasis on voluntary family planning
programs, and that requires good information for the participants,
she says.
   In many ways it's an effort related to the debate under way in
the United States, concentrating on what has come to be called
``patient rights'' to be informed and make their own medical
decisions.
   ``It's a big challenge for people in public health, because
doctors have been used to giving orders. `Here's a prescription,
you take it and you'll get well.''' Piotrow said.
   ``It's a new era in health programs and it's going to depend on
individuals making informed choices themselves.''
   ``In the age of modern technology, (medical personnel) learned
how to use all the machines, but somehow the interpersonal side got
a little neglected,'' she added.
   Once counselors understand better ways to deal with clients, the
same approaches can be used in AIDS counseling, nutrition
counseling and even drug counseling, she added.

   A grand jury will release its findings on
criminal intent this week in the police bombing three years ago of
the radical group MOVE in which 11 people died and 61 homes were
destroyed by a resulting fire.
   Police arranged the bombing of the barricaded and heavily
fortified row house on May 13, 1985, in an attempt only to evict
the MOVE followers. Neighbors had complained to city officials and
threatened to take matters into their own hands if nothing was done
about the group.
   Members of the mysterious group, whose name did not stand for
anything in particular, championed back-to-nature rituals, lived in
filth, refused to send their children to school, and openly
disobeyed health and safety laws, authorities said.
   An investigating commission said the group ``had evolved into an
authoritarian, violence-threatening cult.''
   The police bomb touched off a rooftop fire that soon raged out
of control while firemen held back, afraid they would be hit by
gunfire that had echoed through the neighborhood. The 11 killed,
five of them children, were all inside the MOVE house.
   No one has been accused of any criminal act in the bombing. But
both Philadelphia County and federal grand juries began
investigating. The Philadelphia report is due Tuesday.
   ``I would really be hard-pressed, quite frankly, to see how any
grand jury could come out with any indictments other than a
scathing report,'' said Robert Hurst, president of the Fraternal
Order of Police.
   Officers built the bomb and dropped it from a helicopter after
getting approval from Mayor W. Wilson Goode.
   A special commission appointed by Goode later charged the mayor
was ``grossly negligent'' in approving the bombing. It also
condemned the use of gunfire by police as ``reckless'' and
``unconscionable.''
   Relatives of the mostly black MOVE victims denounced Goode, the
first black mayor in the nation's fifth largest city, as ``a
murderer'' and have sued the city for damages.
   Only two people, a woman and boy, escaped from the house. The
12-year-old boy claimed others tried to flee but were driven back
by gunfire.
   Sources quoted in Saturday's editions of The Philadelphia
Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News said the grand jury would
recommend no criminal charges but would be harshly critical of
officials involved.
   ``The charges wouldn't survive a preliminary hearing,'' said an
unidentified source quoted by the Daily News, which said sources
told it the panel concluded that proving criminal intent would be
difficult.
   ``It's a very detailed legal analysis of everything that
happened on that day,'' a source who spoke on condition of
anonymity told the Inquirer. ``This will lay out in one complete
document by a grand jury the facts as they found them to be and, I
think, will lay rest to virtually every question that exists.''
   District Attorney Ronald Castille, asked about his nearly
two-year investigation of the case, refused to say whether he
expected criminal indictments. ``It's totally up to the grand
jury,'' he said.
   ``No comment,'' echoed Joseph Kovitsky of the Justice
Department, whose attorneys are in charge of an investigation into
whether the bombing violated anyone's civil rights.
   The federal grand jury also is reportedly winding up its work.
   Goode, who took responsibility for approving the dropping of the
bomb, has said repeatedly that he doesn't believe he will be
indicted.
   Other possible targets are former city Managing Director Leo
Brooks, who ran operations at the MOVE scene, former Police
Commissioner Gregore Sambor, who planned the bombing, and Fire
Commissioner William Richmond.
   Damage caused by the police action has exceeded $20 million,
including rebuilding the burned-down neighborhood that originally
left some 250 homeless.
   The mayor barely won re-election last November, winning by only
17,000 votes out of morethan 750,000 cast in a city where Democrats
have a nearly 3 to 1 edge.
   Surviving MOVE members have disappeared or are in jail. Founder
John Africa, born as Vincent Leaphart, died in the fire.
   Children once a central part of the group have been cared for
and raised by the city, to the extent of private tutoring, in an
effort to return them to society.

   George Bush says there ``isn't a short list,
there isn't a long list'' yet of possible running mates, but he
indicates with some understatement that he wants to use less frenzy
in the selection than Ronald Reagan did eight years ago.
   ``I hope I'll make as good a choice but I'll use a different
method,'' says the vice president, who clinched enough delegates
last week to put a lock on the Republican presidential nomination.
   Bush was an 11th hour compromise at the 1980 convention after a
chaotic few days during which Reagan toyed with the idea of sharing
the ticket with former President Gerald Ford.
   With the luxury of time, Bush insists he hasn't begun to even
consider a vice presidential choice or to set up a selection
process _ and likely won't pick a running mate until after the
Democratic convention in July.
   ``The only list of names is the one he's got in his mind and he
isn't telling anybody,'' spokesman Peter Teeley said.
   But that doesn't stop the speculation from flying.
   As Bush travels around the country, he is constantly bombarded
with questions on the subject. More often than not, the queries
have a clear regional flavor.
   Campaigning in Buffalo, Bush was asked if he might pick
vanquished rival Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y. In Hershey, Pa., reporters
wanted to know about former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh.
In Philadelphia, it was New Jersey Governor Tom Kean; In
Evansville, Ind., Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
   ``I really have not sat down with advisers or set out the
procedures to follow,'' Bush told reporters last week. ``Of course,
I'm going to do that.''
   Conventional political wisdom suggests that the nominee can do
best by selecting a running mate from a different region of the
country from his own.
   For Bush, that would rule out a lot of potential contenders
since he claims links to Texas, where he maintains a voting
residence; Maine, where he has a home; Connecticut, where he grew
up; and Massachusetts, where he was born.
   That appears to leave the West and Midwest. And among those
frequently mentioned as possibilities are California Gov. George
Deukmejian, Illinois Governor Jim Thompson or one of the Doles,
either former rival Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas or his wife, Elizabeth.
   But Bush downplays geography as a crucial factor.
   ``We are in a new communications age. These geographical things
are important but far less important than they used to be,'' he
suggested recently.
   The vice president has denied reports that he had already set up
a search team, claiming ``no one authorized by me'' is involved in
any such activity.
   Bush aides say he will exercise more caution in picking a ticket
mate because, as vice president himself for eight years, he is
extremely sensitive to the nature of the job.
   Bush says he wants to make sure he picks someone who's on the
same wave length as he is, as well as a person _ he is careful to
say ``man or woman'' _ qualified to take over as president should
anything happen to him.
   Along with Elizabeth Dole, three other women are mentioned
prominently in speculation as possible running mates: former U.N.
ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor and Kansas Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum.
   But Bush just isn't giving out any hints, one way or the other.
   ``I vowed not to get into speculation on that question until
after the Democratic convention and then probably not say anything
about it,'' he said.
   Agreeing there isn't much excitement on the Republican side of
the presidential race these days, Bush also hints that withholding
the name will provide an ``element of suspense'' that might pass as
excitement.
   Still, Bush says suggestions keep coming to him unsolicited
``over the transom, under the door, in plain brown envelopes.''
   At one news conference, he told reporters that he had, in fact,
just received one, patting his shirt pocket.

<TEXT>
   A 170-member high school marching band from
Pennsylvania barely had room to maneuver their trombones Sunday at
the Great Wall, but May Day crowds climbed the ramparts and peered
over the parapets to see them play.
   The Pennsbury High School Band from Fairless Hills, Pa.,
entertained thousands of visitors to the wall with renditions of
the U.S. and Chinese national anthems, a medley of American songs,
``It's a Small World'' and other tunes.
   ``I was very pleased. Now I'm very harried,'' said band director
Michael Grothman as his young musicians, trading their orange,
black and white uniforms for T-shirts and jeans, scattered for
sightseeing on China's most famous monument.
   The band, claiming to be the largest group of foreign musicians
to visit China, arrived in Beijing on Saturday night after touring
the ancient capital of Xian.
   Richard Hansel, a Fairless Hills businessman who helped organize
the trip, said 750,000 Chinese lined the streets of Xian to see the
band perform. ``It was just magnificent,'' said Hansel, who has two
daughters in the band.
   The band was unable to parade on the cramped and crowded wall.
The crowd, strung out along the wall, was curious but unresponsive,
even when the American shouted out a loud ``Ni hao!'' or ``Hello!''
   One 9-year-old nodded uncertainly when asked if he liked the
music. A young woman commented that Chinese high schools also have
bands, ``but nothing so grand as this.''
   Wendy Gallena, a 17-year-old senior and pom-pom captain, said
being able to play on the Great Wall was ``really emotional.'' She
said the Great Wall was ``awesome.''
   Hansel, who sells processing equipment in China, helped work out
the trip after the band was one of eight to play in the 1986 New
Year's Day Parade of Roses in Pasadena, Calif.
   ``We wanted to take this art to as many people as we could,'' he
said.
   He said students paid for about two-thirds of the cost of the
trip, which will approach $400,000, by selling candy, Christmas
ornaments, plants and other items. Thirty-four chaperones and about
20 others, mostly parents, also were on the trip.
   The band on Tuesday will be the first foreign musical group to
perform on Tiananmen Square, the vast plaza in central Beijing
surrounded by the Forbidden City, the Great Hall of the People and
Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum. The group will also stage a concert
Tuesday night at the Capital Gymnasium.
   Last year a 100-member band from Live Oaks High School of Morgan
Hill, Calif., toured China and played on the Great Wall.

   A bus crowded with shoppers was blown
apart Sunday and at least 26 passengers were killed when Tamil
rebels detonated explosives buried in the ground, military
officials said.
   Thirty people were injured, and 15 of them were in critical
condition at local hospitals, the officials said. It was the second
Tamil attack on a passenger bus in two days.
   The blast threw bodies into the dense jungle beside the road
near the village of Sittaru, 25 miles southwest of the eastern port
of Trincomalee. About 75 passengers were aboard the bus, and
officials were searching for more victims.
   Most of the victims were Sinhalese, the majority ethnic group on
the island, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The dead included two little boys, they said.
   On Saturday, Tamil militants ambushed a bus in the northern
Vavuniya District, killing five civilians and six Sri Lankan
soldiers who were guarding the vehicle.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the
nation's 16 million population, claim they are discriminated
against by the Buddhist Sinhalese, who are 75 percent of the people
and control the government and military.
   Militant Tamils have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland since 1983 in the north and east, where most
Tamils live.
   India, which has a large Tamil population of its own, mediated a
peace accord last July aimed at ending the insurgency. But the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest rebel group, rejected
the pact and resumed warfare.
   India has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to try to
put down the Tigers, but they have not stopped the militants'
attacks.
   Military officials said victims from Sunday's attack were
airlifted by Sri Lankan air force helicopters to government
hospitals in Anuradhapura, east of Trincomalee, which is about 150
miles northeast of Colombo.
   The military officials said the death toll could rise when
rescue operations resumed Monday. The operations were curtailed at
6 p.m. Sunday.
   Army Maj. Jayantha Jayasinghe said soldiers moved to the site to
search for the killers.

<HEAD>Bush Picks Up Endorsement From Beyond the Grave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When George Bush visited Ohio State
University, he picked up one legendary Buckeye's endorsement from
beyond the grave.
   The vice president got a spirited reception at the Student Union
over the weekend after a rousing introduction from Gene Watts, an
Ohio State history professor who is a Republican state senator.
   Watts doubled as a medium on this occasion, too, delivering up
this message for Bush from the late, great Ohio State football
coach, Woody Hayes.
   ``Woody and I would often get together, not to discuss football,
but rather history and politics,'' Watts said.
   ``In one of those conversations _ and I'm remembering this I
believe exactly _ Woody Hayes, who was just a strong supporter of
George Bush, said to me, `Professor, George Bush is going to be the
best president in the 20th century,''' Watts said to cheers.
   Bush and Hayes were buddies. The vice president attended the
funeral of the colorful, irascible coach who lost his job after
striking an opposing team's player.
   Bush picked up the football metaphor and ran with it.
   ``This is the age of glamour and hot rhetoric, but look at
Woody's record: 13 Big Ten titles, eight Rose Bowls, two national
championships. ... It's exactly what we're going to do: We're going
to pound out those yards, 3 yards and a cloud of dust, and whip
either (Jesse) Jackson or (Michael) Dukakis. Let me at 'em come
fall!''
   His rivals, he said, are full of ``gloom and doom. They want to
drop back, fall on the ball and then punt.''
   Bush went from metaphor to reality, donning a scarlet athletic
jacket and walking to midfield before 60,000 Ohio State fans to
give the referees the official game ball for a spring football
scrimmage.

   Bush often talks about how happy he is to have sewed up the
Republican nomination, and how eager to get on with the fall
campaign.
   But the race he really seems to want to run has already been
waged, eight years ago.
   He seldom fails to invoke the memory of a Democratic shade,
Jimmy Carter, who lost the White House to Ronald Reagan and Bush in
1980.
   The memory of Carter ``hangs over Democrats like a shadow, an
unwanted reminder of the last time they were in Washington,'' Bush
said at a Cleveland rally.
   In Columbus, he said the Democrats' rhetoric ``sounds exactly
like Jimmy Carter _ prime rate of interest at 21{ percent and
double-digit inflation, and blaming the American people for
failure. ... It is an exact overlay of what went on from 1977 to
1981.''
   Bush lauds ``the longest recovery in history'' that has occurred
on Reagan's watch _ 64 months long, with 15 million new jobs.
   He seldom mentions the near tripling of the national debt that
has also occurred on his watch. He calls the deficit the biggest
economic problem, but says, ``I blame the Congress. They are
spending us into debt.''

<TEXT>
   Bush's syntax sometimes gets the best of him, and he coins words
with abandon.
   A paean to the American spirit _ ``the spirit of optimism and
determination that enabled American settlers to push past the snows
and the deserts of the West,'' as he said in Marietta, Ohio _ came
out this way in a Fort Wayne, Ind., factory: ``We're the United
States of America. We rolled back the frontiers and battled the
deserts and the snows.''
   Elsewhere in Fort Wayne, drug traffickers became
``narco-trafficanters.''
   He complained to reporters in Cleveland about the glamorizing of
drugs in a video that he and his wife rented. Bush said the movie,
which he did not name, was ``almost a societal condone-ation of
cocaine.''

   Patrick Johnson's friends winked and
joked about improvements in his social life when he announced he
was going to the almost exclusively female Mount Holyoke College
for a year.
   Life at the school of 2,000 women, however, has been no joke for
Johnson.
   ``I felt like the ultimate minority,'' he said. ``It's not quite
so fun as you might think.''
   Fellow male student Alex Ommaya still gets school mail addressed
to ``Miss Ommaya'' after more than a year at Mount Holyoke. One
recent missive reminded him that he will need a white dress for the
Alumni Day parade later this month.
   ``I'm thinking of wearing a toga,'' said Ommaya.
   Johnson and Ommaya comprise two-thirds of the entire male
student population at the exclusive school. The other third is Josh
Winchell, who is spending a semester there as an exchange student
from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.
   Even the ebullient, resilient Winchell found his first week at
Mount Holyoke slightly rough. ``But I have two sisters, so I didn't
see this as a major obstacle,'' he said.
   The 151-year-old undergraduate college in rural western
Massachusetts has long resisted the tide of coeducation that has
swept other single-sex schools, but does admit men to its graduate
programs in the sciences.
   The school also allows men from four nearby colleges _ Amherst,
Hampshire, Smith and the University of Massachusetts _ to take
classes and has an exchange program with 11 other Northeast
colleges.
   But Mount Holyoke sends more students off to coed campuses than
it brings in, said Dean of Studies Sarah Sutherland. She said male
exchange students consequently stand out, but ``if this institution
has any mission, ultimately it is the obliteration of
discrimination on the grounds of sex.''
   Ommaya, 23, of Bethesda, Md., was admitted to Mount Holyoke's
two-year graduate program in neuroscience after graduating from
Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He will be the lone male to
graduate from the school this month.
   He also is the only man to head a student campus organization.
He said he was appointed to run the office that provides student
entertainment because he was the only applicant.
   He did so well at perking up a reportedly dismal night life _ by
opening a piano bar and holding casino and masquerade parties _
that he was honored by the Student Government Association for his
contribution to the college.
   Ommaya said he wasn't aware Mount Holyoke was a women's school
when he applied after reading about the neuroscience program in a
catalog that neglected to mention men were scarce on campus.
   ``Vassar is also a Seven Sisters school, so I should have known,
but Mount Holyoke is not one of the sisters you remember,'' he
said. Vassar is now coeducational.
   He said an admissions officer's questions tipped him off. ``She
kept asking me why I wanted to go here, what I would get as a male
from it. I finally figured out why when I looked it up in
Barron's,'' a college guide.
   The school's single-sex status did not dissuade him. ``It was
just an interesting factor.''
   The first few months, however, were tough. Ommaya was stared at
during dormitory meals, stopped and questioned on his way to class.
``It's the first time I've ever been discriminated against as a
white man,'' he said.
   In time, the stares stopped and he developed friendships, but he
longed for male company and, like some lonely women, began to
ponder obsessively the question ``How can I meet men?''
   ``I had to keep myself from walking up to men and saying, `Hi,
how're you doin', do you want to be friends?''' he said.
   The son of a Mount Holyoke English professor, Johnson came to
the school for a tuition-free year to catch up on physics and other
courses before returning to Swarthmore College outside Philadelphia.
   The 20-year-old junior said he wasn't prepared for the
overwhelmingly female environment. ``I got tremendously freaked out
at first just sitting in classes full of women,'' he said. ``But
people were very nice, actually.''
   Nevertheless, his experience at Mount Holyoke has soured him
permanently on women's colleges.
   ``I think that to spend the years of 18 to 22 on a campus with
all women _ it's got to be a little bit strange,'' he said.

   Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Los Angeles
Rams, has filed for divorce from her seventh husband, who was
released from prison last September after serving time on tax
charges related to ticket scalping.
   Dominic Frontiere held no position with the football team, and
the divorce is not expected to affect its ownership. In the divorce
petition filed March 31 in Santa Monica Superior Court, Georgia
Frontiere cited ``irreconcilable differences.''
   Attorney Richard Marmaro, who helped represent Dominic Frontiere
during his criminal trial, told the Orange Country Register that
the settlement does not affect ownership of the Rams.
   The team's front office would make no comment on the divorce.
   The Frontieres were married in 1980. The previous year,
Georgia's sixth husband, Carroll Rosenbloom, drowned while swimming
in Florida. He had owned the Rams, and his widow inherited the NFL
team.
   Dominic Frontiere, 56, an award-winning composer, was indicted
in June of 1986 on three counts stemming from selling more than
2,500 tickets to the 1980 Super Bowl in Pasadena for more than
their face value.
   He pleaded guilty of one count, falsifying his tax return, and
was sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison. He was
released after nine months.

   Three British soldiers were
killed Sunday and three were injured when Irish Republican Army
terrorists sprayed one car with machine-gun fire and blew up
another in separate attacks.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for both attacks in a statement
delivered to media in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
   ``We have a simple message for (Prime Minister Margaret)
Thatcher _ disengage from Ireland and there will be peace. If not,
there will be no haven for your military personnel and you will
regularly be at airports awaiting your dead,'' it said.
   The 1:30 a.m. car bomb tore apart a vehicle as it left the
parking lot of a discotheque frequented by British troops in
Nieuwbergen, a country town on the West German-Dutch border. Two of
the three Royal Air Force men inside were killed immediately. The
third was admitted to the intensive care ward of a local hospital.
His condition was not immediately known.
   ``It was like a plane going through the sound barrier,'' said
Piet Hubbers, who heard the blast from his home five miles away.
   ``The car was already on fire. Twenty yards away, a boy
(soldier) was lying all covered in blood,'' said another witness,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The bodies were in such condition that they could not
immediately be identified,'' police spokesman Louis Steens said.
   An hour earlier, in the border community of Roermond about 30
miles away, gunmen opened fire on three British air force men who
had just gotten into their car after leaving a cafe, district
prosecutor Rolph Gonsalves told reporters.
   They were fired on from very close range, probably with
automatic weapons, he said.
   Senior Aircraftsman Ian Shinner, 20, died at the scene. Another
was in serious condition at a local hospital and a third was
treated for minor shoulder injuries. The injured were not
identified.
   They were the first IRA attacks in nearly 10 years in the
Netherlands. Authorities have attributed the lack of violence to
the nation's apparent reputation as a haven for IRA activists.
   ``We of course have to consider that it could be the start of a
new series of attacks,'' Gonsalves said.
   The last IRA attack here was March 22, 1979, when British
Ambassador Richard Sykes was assassinated outside his home in The
Hague.
   The latest victims were all based in West Germany and off duty
at the time of the attacks. They were in the Netherlands to take
part in local festivities marking the 50th birthday of Dutch Queen
Beatrix.
   Both targeted cars had British license plates.
   The IRA statement of responsibility was signed with the
pseudonym ``P. O'Neil, Republican Publicity Bureau in Dublin,'' a
name the IRA uses in such announcements.
   British security forces are the main targets of the IRA, the
mainly Roman Catholic guerrilla group fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   There are several British military installations are along the
Dutch-West German border.
   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., British
Defense Secretary George Younger condemned the killing of ``totally
innocent people,'' who he said were ``off duty and were unarmed and
were nothing to do with any military operation whatever.''
   Denzil Davies, the opposition Labor Party's defense spokesman,
said the victims ``were in Germany and Holland doing their duty as
part of our NATO obligations, and there is not one shred of
justification for attacking them in this way.''
   Sectarian and political violence has taken about 2,600 lives
since it flared in Northern Ireland in 1969. The deaths include 819
members of the British security forces.

<HEAD>Fire Department Tavern Closes After 45 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the alarm sounded in the Chicago Fire
Department's ``9th Division,'' no one raced for the firetrucks.
   Most of the firefighters only laughed, cheered and raised their
beer bottles when the lights and the sirens went off for the last
time. Others took a final slide down the brass pole.
   The occasion was the retirement of Jim Rzonca, 74, ending his
watch as the department's favorite saloonkeeper after 45 years of
chasing firetrucks and washing the smoke out of firefighters'
throats at his Jim's Fire Barn.
   ``Jim's been to more fires than most firemen,'' said Capt. Jim
Dean, president of the Chicago Fire Officials Association. ``And he
probably knows more about the Fire Department than most fire
chiefs.''
   Dean was among several hundred firefighters and other friends
who crowded the tavern late Saturday in honor of the closing,
standing three deep at the long bar and clustered around the free
buffet of Italian and Polish specialities.
   ``I've been coming here ever since I joined the Fire Department
in 1965, and my father, who was a captain, too, came here before
me,'' said Dean. ``There aren't nine official divisions in the
department, but we call this place the `9th Division' as sort of a
code name.
   ``Jim keeps a fire scanner going behind the bar and knows where
every unit is going. But sometimes we had to tend bar ourselves
because he was out chasing fires.''
   Rzonca fell in love with firefighting as a boy when he delivered
newspapers to the local firehouse. But his only official fire
department job was for three months with the fire marshal's office
before he and his wife, Stella, opened the tavern. Now their two
sons are firefighters.
   The tavern walls were covered with fire memorabilia: model
firetrucks, oxygen masks, diving tanks, photographs of notable
fires, badges and helmets.
   While posing for a photographer on closing night, Rzonca donned
a helmet from the special force that protected the Century of
Progress Exposition in 1933.
   ``I have helmets from almost every battalion in Chicago, most of
the suburbs and plenty from other cities and states,'' said Rzonca.
``People make jokes about visiting firemen, but I always treated
them like real guests.
   ``I can go to the fire department in just about any city and be
treated well myself _ especially if I take the time to be nice to
the firehouse cook.''
   One special glass case contained helmets and dress caps from
firefighters who died on duty or from injuries suffered fighting
fires.
   ``I had some very sad experiences not being a real firefighter
and being around these men all the time,'' he said.
   On a lighter note, Rzonca remembered a succession of dogs that
divided their lives between various firehouses and his tavern.
Most, in keeping with tradition, were Dalmatians.
   ``One engine company dropped off `Buster.' Said he was so dumb
he couldn't be trained,'' he recalled. ``I taught him to pose for
pictures with his head and paws hanging out of the hook-and-ladder
window. I even got him to wear football shoulderpads.''
   Rzonca admitted he really didn't want to hang up his own helmet.
   ``Oh, I'm closing all right,'' Rzonca said. ``But after a month
or so, I wouldn't be suprised if I didn't open up again as a
three-nights-a-week private club _ firefighters only.''

<TEXT>
   With the amnesty program for illegal aliens
about to end, the government is preparing to shift the emphasis on
immigration reform to employers.
   The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 mandates
sanctions against employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers.
   Starting June 1, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has
the discretion to issue warning citations or to levy fines against
employers who violate the law. Currently, the INS must initially
issue warning citations.
   The agency will remain flexible and there won't be a
``crackdown'' with fines starting June 1, immigration Commissioner
Alan Nelson said in an interview with reporters last week.
   ``The purpose of sanctions isn't to penalize employers,'' Nelson
said. ``The purpose is to keep employers from hiring illegal aliens
and if you can do it with a positive twist you're a lot better off.
   ``Be sure they're educated, be sure they understand why it's
good business for them'' to not hire cheap illegal labor, Nelson
said.
   ``We can always tighten the screws to the employers and we're
doing that,'' but he said the sanctions portion of the program
would proceed through a ``gradual, deliberate building process.''
   The agency is to hire 900 additional investigators through the
beginning of next year and one of their prime duties will be to
participate in the employer sanctions program.
   To date, the INS has issued 2,000 citations to employers and
levied 80 to 90 fines.
   Nelson expressed satisfaction that Congress refused to extend
the 12-month amnesty program for illegal aliens which ends at
midnight Wednesday.
   He said the purpose of the year-and-a-half-old law, of which the
amnesty program, is a part ``is to stop illegal immigration.''
   ``We wouldn't want to send a message below the border that it's
still OK to come here illegally and then if you do, there still
might be amnesty,'' Nelson said. ``Congress made it clear, `One
time only' and stuck to their guns.''
   Nelson said legalization offices will be open until midnight
Wednesday and amnesty candidates standing in line at that time will
be processed.
   The Senate last Thursday blocked a seven-month extension of the
amnesty program for undocumented immigrants.
   Although amnesty requests have soared in recent weeks as the
deadline approaches, applications are running significantly behind
initial projections. Amnesty requests total 1.29 million with
another 440,000 people applying under a program for agricultural
workers. The INS had estimated as many as 2 million would apply.
   Nelson said ``nobody knows'' how many illegal aliens might
qualify for the amnesty program and he downplayed the 2 million
figure. He said applications are falling somewhat below initial
estimates partly because non-profit groups and other non-government
community groups overestimated the number of applications they
would help the INS handle.
   Under the 1986 law, aliens who came to this country illegally
before Jan. 1, 1982, and who have lived here continually since then
may apply for amnesty.

   Michael Dukakis, who promises to use allegations
of wrongdoing in the Reagan administration against George Bush, can
expect swift return fire from the vice president, whose campaign is
being helped by two longtime adversaries of the likely Democratic
nominee.
   Bush aides said last week they were researching ``scandals''
during Dukakis' three terms as Massachusetts governor to use if
Dukakis attacks Bush's integrity.
   The aides also said Bush would not hesitate to take the
offensive against Dukakis, a point Bush himself is underscoring.
   ``There is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a
guilt-by-association mode where we can find in Massachusetts
politics,'' the vice president said Friday. ``We've got some cannon
fodder.''
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley sounded a similar warning.
   ``Politicians live in glass houses and they better be damn
careful when they start throwing stones,'' Teeley said. ``I think
Dukakis better be very careful about the so-called `sleaze
factor.'''
   But Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach indicated the issue would be
raised.
   ``The vice president knows that the vast majority of Americans
have serious questions about his commitment to ethics in
government,'' Dach said. ``This administration is living in a very
precarious glass house.''
   Dukakis frequently criticizes Attorney General Edwin Meese,
saying administration officials including Bush should force Meese
to resign because of his legal troubles.
   Aides said he would intensify that attack following a Bush
comment Friday that he ``certainly would'' hire Meese if a special
prosecutor investigating Meese's conduct found no wrongdoing.
   Dukakis also has derided influence-peddling in the
administration, apparent references to convictions of two former
Reagan aides, Michael Deaver and Lyn Nofziger, for wrongdoing in
connection with lobbying of the White House.
   Dukakis has never been tied to wrongdoing, but there have been
several occasions during his tenure when officials have faced
criminal charges or been forced to resign because of improper
activities.
   The governor has a reputation as a reformist dating back to his
days as a legislator in the 1960s. He was elected governor in 1974
and 1982 in elections in which corruption was a major issue.
   ``I've been around the politics business for almost 30 years and
of all the people I've dealt with I've never dealt with anybody
with more integrity,'' said former Massachusetts Attorney General
Francis X. Bellotti, the state's top prosecutor during eight of
Dukakis' 10 years as governor.
   New Hampshire Republican Gov. John Sununu, a frequent Dukakis
critic, offered a preview of a possible line of attack last week.
   ``Frankly, I think Mike Dukakis is going to have to answer to
such charges of _ I guess the phrase the media has been using is
the sleaze issue,'' Sununu told a news conference.
   Atop Sununu's laundry list was the guilty plea last month of
former Dukakis education adviser Gerard Indelicato to charges he
helped steal $80,000 in grant money. Indelicato had been a Dukakis
campaign worker and was appointed president of a small state
college, a post he resigned just before being indicted in the fraud
case.
   Controversies during Dukakis administrations include convictions
last year of nine police officers and an ex-legislative aide in a
scheme involving the theft of promotional exams. A Dukakis
appointee had named one of those convicted as superintendent of the
Metropolitan District Commission police.
   The previous superintendent, named by the same Dukakis
appointee, retired after being reprimanded for approving an
electronic sweep of the office of a state legislator under federal
investigation. Former Massachusetts U.S. Attorney William Weld, a
Republican, thanked the Dukakis administration for its help in the
``Examscam'' investigation.
   In 1985, the No. 2 man in the state Department of Public Safety,
Robert H. Cunningham, resigned after reports he associated with a
convicted gambler.
   Helping Bush attack Dukakis is former Democratic Gov. Edward
King, who defeated Dukakis in 1978 and then lost in a 1982 rematch.
King, now a Republican, has attacked Dukakis during recent
appearances on nationally syndicated television shows.
   But King's own tenure as governor was marred by scandals _ and
that could prove a liability in efforts to attack Dukakis.

He was 81.
   Stoppa suffered from leukemia for two years and died of
complications of the disease, said Dr. Giuseppe Pappa.
   Since 1935, Stoppa appeared in dozens of Italian and
international films. He also founded a theater that employed the
noted director Luchino Visconti in the early stages of his career.
   Stoppa played Pope Alexander III in ``Becket.'' Some of his
other film credits include ``Rocco And His Brothers,'' ``Behold A
Pale Horse'' and ``Once Upon A Time In The West.''
   He had not made a film since 1982 and illness had kept him in
his house since Feb. 18.
   The funeral was scheduled for Tuesday in the Church of Saint

   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has ordered an
investigation into reports that Indian workers who were promised
jobs in Libya were instead forced into military training, the
Libyan news agency JANA reported Sunday.
   The Press Trust of India reported Thursday that 97 people had
been sent by a New Delhi-based agency to Libya, where they were
promised jobs.
   It said they were instead given military training and that India
was seeking the return of 50 of the Indians still in Libya.
   JANA quoted a unidentified source in the Libyan Foreign Ministry
as saying Gadhafi ordered an investigation of the ``rumors about
the misuse of Indian workers in Libya'' in Libya and India to
``clarify the truth about this matter.''

<HEAD>Jackson Takes More Combative Tone As Dukakis Delegate Lead Widens</HEAD>
<HEAD>By RITA BEAMISH</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, striking a combative stance as
he loses ground to Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis,
plans to campaign in every state remaining on the primary calendar,
presenting himself as the clear alternative to the Republicans.
   In the face of Dukakis' widening lead in the delegate count _
he's ahead by roughly 400 _ Jackson vows he won't give up his
fight. And he won't entertain what he calls ``absurd'' talk about
his going for a vice presidential spot.
   Focusing heavily on delegate-rich California, Jackson says he
will not slacken his campaign pace, and will stage advertising
campaigns in each of the upcoming states.
   ``You can't win unless you go there,'' said campaign manager
Gerald Austin. ``We're going to be taking our message everywhere.''
   Austin's tone was emphatic in the wake of Jackson's own public
contradiction of comments Austin made last week. In published
remarks, Austin downplayed prospects of winning the nomination and
spoke more in terms of Jackson's achievements in broadening the
Democratic Party.
   Although it appears a unlikely that Jackson can overtake Dukakis
in delegates before the primaries end June 7, Jackson himself is
telling his supporters not to give up hope.
   The last big primaries are June 7 in California and New Jersey,
and the campaign for so-called super delegates continues. The
convention begins July 18.
   Jackson's still-developing schedule calls for him to spend a day
each in Montana, New Mexico, Nebraska and West Virginia, which also
hold late contests.
   He tentatively plans three days in New Jersey, four days in
Oregon and the rest of the time in California, where 314 Democratic
delegates are up for grabs on June 7, said campaign political
director Frank Watkins.
   Austin said Jackson will continue to appeal to the ethnic
groups, gays and the economically struggling who have been the
focus of his campaign so far.
   While continuing to rail agains the Reagan administration and
stress the importance of a Democratic victory, Jackson will
increasingly emphasize distinctions between himself and Dukakis on
the issues, Austin said.
   Jackson unveiled that strategy this past week. In contrast to
his earlier aversion to criticizing Democratic rivals, Jackson is
portraying Dukakis as an uninspiring candiate who is lacking a
clear commitment to reverse Reagan's economic programs.
   Austin and other campaing aides declined to discuss what states
they expect to do best in, but Austin said Jackson should do better
in Tuesday's Ohio primary than he does in Indiana, with a primary
the same day, because Jackson has spent little time in Indiana.
   He filed delegate slates in only 18 of Ohio's 21 congressional
districts, but Austin said the campaign is contesting every one of
those districts.
   Jackson's buying up of $400,000 worth of air time in Ohio
includes a new ad that will attack Dukakis as wiling only to
``manage'' Reaganomics, not to bring about real economic change.
   Jackson is also becoming increasingly sensitive about his aides
commenting publicly on strategy. Campaign aides have been
close-mouthed following Jackson's reaction to the Austin remarks
about his campaign prospects.
   ``I'm not commenting today,'' said longtime Jackson aide Frank
Watkins, when asked about the campaign game plan.
   ``He doesn't like poeple boxing him in on options,'' said one
Jackson adviser. ``He is his own person'' and has his own sense of
where his campaign is going, said the source, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Jackson camp expects to have a significant impact on the
Democratic party platform and discussions on that should begin
soon, aides said.
   One adviser even said he has no doubt that the party will allow
the Jackson campaign, which has taken the lead in shaping campaign
issues, to write the platform.
   The camapign recently won a court victory in New Jersey that
makes it easier for people to vote for for Jackson and his
delegates by pulling the voting lever just once instead of several
times. But Austin said he does not envision any new legal
challenges at this time.
   However, he added: ``Things can come up.'' Many states have
delegate-selection processes that continue after their initial
primaries or caucuses.

   When a 200-ton crane lifted the clipper
schooner Pride of Baltimore II into the Inner Harbor to the cheers
of thousands, this rejuvenated city got ``a new clipper, but the
old Pride,'' Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke said.
   The rebuilding of the city's goodwill ambassador ship, whose
predecessor sank 240 miles north of Puerto Rico in a microburst of
wind and rain on May 14, 1986, came about because of intense public
pressure, the mayor acknowledged.
   ``Without your help the Pride of Baltimore II would have
remained just a wish and a promise,'' Schmoke told people jammed
into every available vantage point near the Pride and on historic
Federal Hill overlooking the harbor.
   ``The Pride of Baltimore is a labor of community love,'' the
mayor said. ``The Pride in Baltimore ... has been uninterrupted
from the very start.''
   The outpouring of public sentiment _ which changed the minds of
officials initially opposed to building a second clipper schooner _
was acknowledged in bittersweet ceremonies Saturday, when Baltimore
dedicated the new vessel in memory of all Marylanders lost at sea.
   Four crew members died in the 1986 sinking of the original Pride.
   The ceremony included music by the red-costumed U.S. Marine
Band, a procession of Maryland schoolchildren bearing symbols of
their areas of the state, the firing of muskets by the Fort McHenry
Guard and a parade of Tall Ships.
   The first Pride, which promoted Baltimore and Maryland in
harbors around the world, was launched by the same Bethlehem Steel
crane known as Big Red in 1977.
   The new Pride, 110 tons of finely crafted hardwoods and ballast
without the masts and engines to be added in coming months, took
form at a waterfront construction site.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer, Baltimore's mayor when the first
Pride was launched and when it was lost, said he had two wishes for
the new vessel. ``God smile on this ship. God keep that crew
safe,'' he said, his voice breaking.
   The launch, attended by former Pride crewmembers and two
survivors of the Pride sinking, also included the ceremonial
ringing of the Pride bell, produced by the McShane Bell Foundry Co.
Inc. of Glen Burnie and presented to the Pride of Baltimore
organization by U.S. Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md.
   ``We are here today to christen a unique vessel ... that will
serve as goodwill ambassador ... a vessel that will also serve as a
living memorial to Captain Armin Elsaesser III, Nina Francesca
Schack, Vincent Lazzaro and Barry Duckworth, who lost their lives
on that fateful day in May 1986,'' she said.
   Moments later, with shipwrights guiding thick yellow cables by
hand and derrick operator Bill Ward working from the crane control
booth, the Pride made the short journey from the construction site
to the water accompanied by wild cheering, cannon fire and fireboat
sprays.
   The ship will undergo sea trials in the fall.

   An American who is the only rabbi for East
Germany's tiny Jewish community said Sunday he's leaving the
communist country because of intolerable working conditions caused
by attempts to silence him.
   Isaac Neuman, a Polish-born survivor of Auschwitz and nine other
Nazi concentration camps, said he will depart for good by year's
end.
   In an interview at his East Berlin apartment, the controversial
65-year-old rabbi talked of interference from Jewish leadership and
objected to government treatment of his religious community.
``There regularly are informers at every worship service and at
every class,'' he said.
   Neuman became the only rabbi for the nation's 350 officially
registered Jews on Sept. 23. He was the nation's first rabbi in 21
years.
   About half of East Berlin's estimated 200 Jews are more than 60
years old. Most were locked up, went into hiding or fled the
country during the Third Reich, Neuman said. Some came back later
from the United States and other places.
   The rabbi received great press attention in the West and in East
Germany when he came to be their spiritual leader.
   Now, he says he will leave later this month. ``It's conceivable
it is for good, but I may be back in September,'' he said. ``I have
no intention of being here beyond 1988, because the situation is
too impossible to work.''
   He said he would return to his home in Champaign, Ill.
   Neuman went to the United States in 1950. After his studies, he
served as rabbi in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, from 1961 to 1974, and in
Champaign, from 1974 to 1987.
   He had retired before taking the job in East Berlin. He said he
had always viewed it as a ``temporary assignment.''
   Neuman said leadership of the local Jewish community kept a
close watch on his activities. He said there might be ``orders from
somewhere to keep me under control.''
   He also said there have been efforts within the Jewish community
to silence him. He was hampered in setting up religious education
classes for adults, he said.
   Other frustrations included a monthly Jewish community bulletin
that omitted mention of last month's anniversary of the Warsaw
Ghetto's Jewish uprising against the Nazis in World War II. In
addition, Neuman complained of an East German cartoonist who he
said plies anti-Semitic themes.
   During the rabbi's stay, he also took to task the editor of one
of the official government newspapers for reporting on clashes in
Israel. He came away without a correction or retraction.
   Neuman, in turn, has been criticized by Germans.
   ``The Jewish community in East Berlin is startled by the
unconventionality and the independence of their rabbi,'' the
authoritative West German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper
said in a profile on April 19. The newspaper also said the
``temperamental rabbi'' had threatened to leave in the past, even
though ``he has things well over there.''
   ``A large apartment and a car are provided for him,'' the
Frankfurter Allgemeine said.
   Neuman is paid by East Berlin's Jewish community, which receives
funds from the communist government.
   Neuman says he has been careful as a foreigner to avoid
involvement in the nation's growing dissident movement, openly
supported by parts of the Lutheran Church.
   But he expressed frustration with the government's stance toward
the Jewish community. He said it should help renovate the
dilapidated Jewish community building.
   Neuman also said most Jews in East Berlin will be sorry to see
him go.
   ``But there were will be a few (other people) who will be glad,
because then they have it under control again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Board Splits Over Cause of Crash That Killed 285 US Soldiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary report on a 1985 air crash in
Newfoundland that killed 248 U.S. troops omits evidence of a
possible explosion or flash fire on board, critics say.
   The report by the Canadian Aviation Safety Board, distributed
confidentially in December, concludes that failure to de-ice the
wings of the heavily loaded Arrow Air charter probably caused the
Dec. 12, 1985 crash, two Canadian newspapers reported over the
weekend.
   But the Ottawa Citizen and the Toronto Globe and Mail said the
preliminary conclusion caused a major split in the 10-member board.
Board chairman Bernard M. Deschenes resigned last week and was
replaced by a senior civil servant, Ken Thorneycroft.
   The board refused to comment on the reported split, the papers
said.
   ``Too many items were excluded as posible contributions to the
cause of the crash,'' Les Benjamin, an opposition New Democratic
Party member of Parliament, was quoted as saying.
   The plane crashed moments after takeoff at Gander Airport, and
all 248 U.S. servicemen on board and eight crew members were killed.
   The members of the 101st Airborne Division were flying home to
Kentucky after peacekeeping duties in the Middle East.
   The aircraft's cockpit voice recorder was not working and its
antiquated flight data recorder provided little information. The
devastated wreckage also made the investigation difficult.
   But the Ottawa Citizen said U.S. explosives expert Irving Pinkel
of San Diego was hired by the airline's insurance company to comb
the wreckage and concluded that an explosion aboard caused the
crash.
   He said he found ``strong evidence of explosion damage'' in a
blown-out section of the fuselage at the front of the passenger
cabin, the paper reported.
   Pinkel was quoted as saying the fuselage appeared ``to have been
punched out by an object that struck the hole at high speed.''
   But Pinkel's findings were discounted and not included in the
board's draft report, the Citizen said.
   It said the board's chief investigator, Peter Boag, dismissed
Pinkel's view in 1986: ``Our investigators have completed their
examinations of the relevant fuselage sections and have found no
evidence to support Pinkel's contention that the holes were caused
by the pre-impact explosion.''
   Boag said Royal Canadian Mounted Police forensic experts found
no explosives residue.
   Opposition members of Parliament say the board's preliminary
report also leaves out evidence that the plane may have been on
fire before it crashed. Two truck drivers say they saw flames
coming from the DC-8 just after takeoff.
   ``They were in separate trucks driving along the Trans-Canada
Highway,'' said George Baker, a Liberal Party lawmaker from
Newfoundland. ``But apparently eyewitness testimony is not
reliable.''
   He said the fire evidence was left out simply because it didn't
concur with the board's conclusions.
   One theory on the crash is that the soldiers were bringing back
flares, shells and practice grenades that may have exploded on
board.
   The Ottawa Citizen said Arrow Air has asked for a judicial
inquiry into what it alleges has been a biased investigation.
   The Toronto Star quoted John Batchelor, chairman of the
Miami-based airline, as saying: ``We still don't fully agree with
the icing theory.''
   The Star said autopsy results showed the blood of some soldiers
contained lethal doses of cyanide, frequently found after airliner
fires.
   Thorneycroft, a former deputy commander of the North American
Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colo., said on
Friday that the board ``still isn't close to release of its report
to the public ... there's still issues we are trying to come to
grips with.''
   He denied any suppression of evidence and pledged a ``full
review'' before a final report comes out, probably next year.
   ``There was no cover-up and there won't be a cover-up,'' he said.
   In 1986, Deschenes ruled out terrorism as the cause of the crash.
   The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, U.S. Army and
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also took part in the
investigation, but ultimate responsibility lies with the Canadian
panel.

<TEXT>
   Each of the four Iran-Contra defense teams
will have a suite in a Washington office building rented by the
federal government as a secure facility to hold thousands of
classified documents.
   The government is paying $24 a square foot annually for the
12,000 feet of space _ $288,000 a year _ which will be for the
exclusive use of the defense and available 24 hours a day.
   The defense may be reviewing as many as 300,000 classified
documents in what is dubbed a Sensitive Compartmented Information
Facility, or SCIF.
   A secure facility is required when classified documents are
needed in a court case. In the past, such facilities usually were
established in a government building such as the Justice Department.
   The new facility is in an office building that sits among trendy
stores and lawyers' offices on Connecticut Avenue, about a
half-dozen blocks from the White House. The space was renovated at
a cost of $200,000, according to Jerry Rubino, director of security
for the Justice Department and the official responsible for the
secure facility.
   The office building that independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh
has been using is also designated a Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facility.
   In addition to the space for the defense teams' use, the
government is paying for furniture, safes, locks, alarm systems,
24-hour security guards, acoustical ceilings and about nine
personal computers that cost up to $6,000.
   The computers are modified with a process that lets them emit a
weaker signal to prevent eavesdropping. Sophisticated spy equipment
can eavesdrop on computers used at normal energy levels, said
Rubino, who noted the system is used by U.S. intelligence agencies.
   A half-dozen offices will be provided for each of the four
separate defense teams representing fired national security aide
Oliver L. North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter, and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim,
Rubino said.
   That seems luxurious to Richard A. Hibey, a Washington attorney
who represented Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former civilian Navy
intelligence analyst who pleaded guilty in 1986 to spying for
Israel.
   Hibey's secure facility was in the Justice Department, where he
had to borrow desks and equipment of department staffers during
normal working hours.
   On weekends, Hibey had to use the department's command center as
a base, sifting through documents in the center's hallway.
   ``If the case came to trial, it would have been totally
unworkable,'' he said.
   Hibey pointed out that in Pollard and other espionage cases,
``you don't need a SCIF of the size and magnitude'' of the
Iran-Contra facility because the crime was the illegal transmittal
of classified documents, regardless of their content.
   In the Iran-Contra case, he said, ``The content of the
classified information is important to understanding the issues. To
know what the intent was, you have to sit down, read them, and
analyze them.
   ``You can't go on doing it in the hallways of the Justice
Department command center,'' he said.
   The Iran-Contra defendants are charged with conspiring to
defraud the government in a scheme to illegally divert to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels the profits from U.S. arms sales to Iran.
They also are accused of illegally covering up their actions, and _
in the case of Secord, Hakim and North _ personally profiting from
the arms transactions.

   A record Lotto America jackpot will
swell to $8.5 million for the May 7 drawing because no one
correctly picked all seven numbers in the latest drawing, a
spokesman of the Iowa-based game said Sunday.
   That's the the highest jackpot reached in the multi-state game
that had its first drawing on Feb. 13.
   A check of computers on Sunday revealed that no one purchased a
ticket for the numbers picked in Saturday night's televised drawing
for a $7.34 million jackpot, said spokesman Bret Voorhees. The
winning numbers were: 1, 3, 17, 19, 27, 29 and 34.
   However, Voorhees said, 22 tickets matched six of the numbers,
entitling each holder to a prize of $2,886, another 1,222 tickets
matched five numbers to win $99 each, and 21,823 players won $5
each by correctly picking four numbers.

   Hospital workers at seven medical
facilities in the San Francisco Bay area overwhelmingly favored a
strike resolution growing out of their demand for better health
benefits.
   In the first round of voting on Saturday, 95 percent approved
the strike authorization, according to Jennifer Fleming,
spokeswoman for Local 250 of the Hospital and Healthcare Workers
Union.
   More voting for the union's 1,700 members is scheduled Monday.
   The resolution is a 10-day notice that the nurses, housekeepers,
laundry workers, technicians and food-service employees will walk
off their jobs unless the dispute is settled. The union's contract
expired Sunday morning.
   The hospitals have proposed that workers pick up nearly $1,200 a
year of their own health care costs.

   They've had to call out a team from
the U.S. Geological Survey to resolve the question of which river
is the world's shortest.
   A fifth-grade class at Lincoln elementary school in Great Falls,
Mont., recently had Montana's Roe River measured and declared the
world's shortest, replacing Lincoln City's D River in the Guinness
Book of World Records.
   The Roe River flows between 275 and 307 feet from a spring into
the Missouri River. The D River flows from Devil's Lake into the
Pacific Ocean.
   However, the record book's entry listing the D River as 440 feet
long was based on an outdated survey a century old; a variety of
state agencies in Oregon say the river could be as short as 100
feet long.
   The answer about which river wins the trophy for shortness is
expected soon.

   Mickey Mouse acted as host at a surprise
reunion in Disneyland of a former Soviet officer and a U.S. Army
officer who first met at the Elbe River during World War II.
   The Soviet visitor, Vladimir Kabaidze, 64, mentioned to his
American hosts that he had exchanged addresses in 1945 at Torgau,
Germany, with an American when they were both first lieutenants.
   Kabaidze, in the United States after being honored by Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a model of Soviet labor, said he had
written his address on a Russian ruble and had gotten in return the
address of GI Frank Parent written on a German mark.
   The reunion Saturday of the two men was arranged by Kabaidze's
host, Barney Oldfield, according to Disneyland spokeswoman Barbara
Warren.
   Oldfield, a retired U.S. Army colonel now working for Litton
Industries, located Parent, 78, in Texas and flew him to California
for the Disneyland surprise.
   ``Mickey Mouse acted as intermediary,'' Ms. Warren said. ``After
greeting Mr. Kabaidze, he waltzed the Russian gentleman over to
where Mr. Parent was standing.
   ``He was pleasantly shocked when Mr. Parent handed him the ruble
note,'' she said.
   The date written on the ruble was April 30, 1945, Ms. Warren
said, exactly 43 years to the day of the reunion.

   The Third Annual Polar Bear Classic,
sponsored by the Great Lakes Surfing Association, ran into some
poor weather. It was too nice.
   The 35 participants in Saturday's event enjoyed clear blue skies
and unseasonably warm temperatures in the upper 60s. For Great
Lakes surfers, who rely on insulated suits, gloves and hoods, balmy
weather makes for poor surfing.
   Waves reached a respectable 4 to 6 feet Friday night, but
Saturday's nice weather generated so-called ankle snappers of just
1 to 2 feet.
   Jeff VanHoeven of Kalamazoo, 27, won the men's competition using
a push-off method. With one foot on his board and one on the lake
bottom, he timed a wave and kick-started.
   Dave Irwin of Bloomfield Hills used a similar technique to win
the long board competition.
   ``Michigan is surrounded by fresh water seas,'' said Irwin, the
association founder and a former Californian. ``You've just got to
search a little to find waves good enough to surf.''
   Other surfers, their competitive spark doused by the lackluster
waves, simply laid on their boards and engaged in friendly paddle
races.
   Higher waves come during storms, and the association's telephone
network goes into action when Great Lakes marine forecasts call for
rough weather.

<HEAD>Separatists Refuse Mediator; Four Gendarmes Wounded by Gunfire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melanesian separatists holding
police hostages refused to accept a Roman Catholic archbishop as
mediator Sunday. Four gendarmes were shot and wounded in the latest
incident in 10 days of violence.
   The separatists called on the United Nations to investigate this
French island territory, where seven people have been killed since
unrest broke out April 22.
   Details of the shooting incident were sketchy.
   Authorities said the four gendarmes were injured by gunfire near
Canala on the eastern coast of the largest island, La Grande Terre.
The officers were evacuated to the capital, Noumea, by helicopter
for treatment at a hospital, authorities said.
   They had no other details.
   The French High Commission in Noumea, previously the main source
for information, said it was ending its regular news briefings for
reporters, citing concern for the 21 officers held hostage.
   Journalists have not been permitted to travel to Ouvea island,
where the hostages were being held in caves.
   The chief separatist movement, the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, said authorities closed down its radio
transmitter, ``increasing the colonial power's total blackout on
information relating to the current events.''
   The front appealed to the United Nations to send a commission of
inquiry to New Caledonia and to ``demand that France furnish
information and explanations on this war it is waging.''
   In its statement, the front said the police held hostage as well
as Melanesian separatists who have been detained should be
considered ``prisoners of war.''
   Monsignor Michel Calvet, archbishop of Noumea, agreed to serve
as mediator to try to win freedom for the hostages and flew briefly
to Ouvea.
   In a radio interview, Calvet said he agreed to the request from
Bernard Pons, minister of overseas territories in the conservative
government of Premier Jacques Chirac. Calvet said he said he was
prepared to mediate for the release of the hostages, but not in the
political situation.
   ``Political negotiations are not within my competence,'' Calvet
said. ``But I told Bernard Pons I was at his disposition for
whatever could save lives. For the moment, I don't see what can be
done in that direction.''
   In Paris, the separatist front's political bureau issued a
statement denouncing Calvet's appointment as a ``maneuver.'' It
again demanded a mediator with authority from Chirac and President
Francois Mitterrand to negotiate a referendum on independence.
   ``Only the intervention of a mediator could permit, after
preliminary discussions, the study of conditions and procedures for
an eventual cease-fire as well as for the liberation or exchange of
prisoners,'' the statement said.
   The standoff began April 22 when rebels raided a police station,
kidnapping 27 gendarmes and killing four others.
   Twelve hostages were later released, but eight more officers
were seized when they tried to negotiate the release of the
remaining hostages.
   Two of those hostages, the head of an anti-terrorism squad and
an assistant prosecutor, were freed and ordered to negotiate on
behalf of the terrorists. They were told the remaining hostages
would be killed if the two men did not return to the cave where the
rebels are hiding out.
   Because of the threat, the government said it considers the two
to still be hostages.
   The native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of
the territory's 145,000 people. About 36 percent of the population
is European, with the rest primarily Asian or Tahitian.
   The separatists are fighting a French government plan to give
partial autonomy to New Caledonia. It would remain a French
territory.
   The plan was approved last year in a referendum.
   Regional assemblies were elected April 24 as part of the Chirac
government's initiative. The rebels who seized the hostages
demanded the annulation of those elections _ held in tandem with
the first round of the French presidential elections _ as well as
the withdrawal of French troops from Ouvea island and appointment
of a mediator to negotiate terms for a new referendum on
independence.

   A senior North Korean intelligence
official arrived Sunday in Seoul after requesting political asylum,
the government said. Press reports said it was the highest-ranking
defection since the Korean War.
   Kim Jeong Min, 45, asked for asylum at a South Korean embassy
while traveling in ``a certain European country on official
business,'' the Foreign Ministry said. It would not identify the
country or say when Kim defected.
   The ministry said Kim had been a senior official in North
Korea's Ministry of Public Security, a powerful intelligence
organization.
   Local press reports said Kim was the highest-ranking North
Korean government offical to defect to South Korea since the end of
the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap said Kim arrived in Seoul on a
Korean Air flight from Bangkok, Thailand, early Sunday. Officials
escorted him through the airport to a car, and Kim ignored
questions from reporters. The officials said he would be detained
for questioning.
   The Foreign Ministry said the government had honored the asylum
request ``out of humanitarian concern and according to
international practices.''
   South Korean authorities ``will conduct thorough investigations
into the backgound, true motive and other circumstances surrounding
Mr. Kim's defection and will make an official announcement on the
result of the investigation in due course,'' a ministry statement
said.

   ``Structural Integrity'' wasn't much to
look at, but the massive cardboard barge set a record for the
largest crew at the 15th annual Great Cardboard Boat Regatta.
   Several crew members steadied the sides of the 20-foot by
20-foot cardboard flatbed Saturday and chanted ``More! More!
More!'' while a steady line of bodies poured off the dock and into
the boat.
   Then, as if a portion of earth had broken off into Campus Lake
at Southern Illinois University, the 56-member crew just floated
away _ sort of.
   The official count on the craft, however, was 58 people because
halfway through the course ``Integrity'' barreled over the top of
another cardboard boat and two capsized riders fished from the lake
were added to the ``Integrity's'' crew.
   In the end, ``Structural Integrity'' buried the former record of
34 people on a cardboard boat set in Du Quoin last year.
   It also tried the patience of regatta Commodore Richard Archer,
who growled, ``Get that thing outta the way!'' when it was blocking
other boats in the race.
   Massive barges like ``Integrity'' are not much to look at, next
to some of the slickly engineered cardboard marvels entered in
Saturday's race.
   But the three mammoth barges carrying a total of 129 riders were
definitely the show-stealers and the crowd-pleasers at the 15th
annual regatta. The crowd of 20,000 people seemed to relish the
wonder of it all.
   Patty Mullen, who held the old record for the biggest crew,
managed to find 38 fellow navigators _ called the ``Murphysboro Hot
Tub Club'' _ to take her personally made craft through the course
at a swift, synchronized clip.
   ``I sent out invitations to everyone I could think of,'' Mullen
said. ``I had no idea how many people were coming.''
   The group _ which also included a dog _ was given this year's
Team Award by regatta judges.
   The third entry in the Battle of the Barge managed 33 people,
but couldn't muster the full trip. The back end of the 40-foot-long
ship fell off at midpoint in the race and the stern began sinking.
   The rest of the boat followed, inch by inch.
   Saturday's crowd was probably the largest in the regatta's
15-year history, organizers said. The 206 boats entered also set a
record for the most participants.

   A 10-story building came down in a loud
blast and a huge cloud of dust Sunday after engineers set off 185
explosives inside the 81-year-old downtown structure.
   It was the first time the implosion method of demolition had
been used in Portland. Hundreds of people lined nearby rooftops and
streets to witness the early morning blast that brought the Corbett
Building down in 5 seconds.
   Officials said there were no injuries and no damage to nearby
buildings. Only a large pile of rubble and a 12-square-block cloud
of dust remained after the building dropped into its basement on
the block behind the historic Pioneer Courthouse.
   The building is being removed to make way for the three-block
Pioneer Place project, which will feature a new department store
and retail shops.
   Some office workers in nearby buildings held parties and had
champagne breakfasts to celebrate the implosion.

   Welfare checks for about 400 Wisconsin
families will be cut this month in the first phase of a program
that uses benefit reductions as a means of forcing dropouts back to
school.
   The Learnfare program, passed by the Legislature last year,
requires reductions in Aid To Families With Dependent Children
benefits for welfare families where teen-agers fail to attend
school regularly.
   The program entered its first phase in March, when penalties
were assessed against welfare recipients ages 13 and 14 and to teen
parents on welfare who failed to meet the schooling requirements.
But those penalties didn't start showing up on welfare checks until
this month.
   The penalties applied if a teen-age parent on welfare or welfare
children 13 and 14 years old dropped out of school or were absent
more than two days a month without a valid reason.
   The program will apply to 15- to 17-year-olds in September.
   In a recent report to the Legislature, Health and Social
Services Secretary Timothy Cullen said only 395 of 16,289 AFDC
families affected by the first phase of the program will be
penalized. A breakdown showed 309 cases involved teen parents and
86 cases involved AFDC families.
   ``We're pleased that the numbers are this low,'' Cullen said.
``We know the numbers (of dropouts) are several hundred lower than
if there hadn't been a Learnfare program.''
   Cullen said there was no way to determine how many welfare
teen-agers had been going to school before Learnfare.
   Although Cullen said the program will help students stay off
welfare when they're adults, one critic said it will do little good.
   ``Failure. That's what schools should be addressing. Their
failure and the kids' failure,'' said state Rep. Rebecca Young, a
former city School Board member. ``We shouldn't be forcing kids
back to school simply so there's another body there.''
   Benefits will be cut an average $100 a month for each month the
students remain out of school or miss more than two days.
   The state Bureau of Economic Assistance said the average AFDC
benefit check is $517 per month, but that the cut would make
beneficiaries eligible for an extra $33 in food stamps.
   The program has no effect on medical assistance to welfare
families.
   Cullen also noted that recipients may appeal for exemption from
Learnfare in cases where school officials determine that teen-agers
are so far behind in schoolwork they will not be able to graduate
by age 19.
   Some may also appeal benefit penalties if they can show there
was inadequate day care and transportation services to help them
attend school, Cullen said.
   ``A number of those cases (exemptions) will involve teen
parents, cases where the person dropped out at age 14 and is 17 now
and could not possibly graduate by 19,'' he said.
   Young said Learnfare unfairly penalizes welfare recipients while
ignoring dropouts and truants from more affluent families.
   ``If we're going to do this, we should extend it to all and
penalize them (non-welfare) families a fifth of their monthly gross
income,'' Young said.
   Young also said the program puts too much pressure on families
already hurt by emotional conflicts and does not give schools the
educational tools they need handle unruly teen-agers or students
who believe they are failures.
   ``If a kid fails in school, this is not the best way to enforce
good behavior. We should find out what made them fail in the first
place,'' Young said.
   Cullen said, however, that many school districts have upgraded
attendance policies, procedures to notify parents of absences and
programs to help children who are at risk of educational failure.

   The Irish Republican Army's deadliest attacks on
the European continent killed three unarmed British servicemen in
the Netherlands Sunday, ending a 14-month lull in IRA assaults
outside Northern Ireland.
   The shooting and car bombing in which three West German-based
British airmen were killed and three were wounded followed the
March 6 slaying by British commandos of three unarmed IRA
guerrillas in Gibraltar.
   Six policemen and soldiers have been killed in Northern Ireland
since the Gibraltar slayings and there had been speculation the IRA
was plotting a major act of vengeance.
   By attacking British servicemen abroad the IRA was reasserting
itself as an international terror force.
   The Ministry of Defense said the attacks in southern Holland
near the West German border were the worst in terms of fatalities
carried out by the IRA against British targets on the continent.
   Security forces in Northern Ireland have been the primary
targets of IRA guerrillas. The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is
fighting to unite Northern Ireland, a British province where
Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the mainly Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   British servicemen on duty in Western Europe with the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization are considered ``soft targets''
because many live off base and tour other areas in their off-hours,
usually without arms.
   British security forces have been criticized by Britain's
opposition parties, the Irish government and the human rights
organization Amnesty International for shooting the three IRA
guerrillas in Gibraltar, apparently without trying to arrest them.
Government officials have said the three were on a bombing mission.
   Defense Secretary George Younger said ``with events of recent
times in mind'' the British servicemen killed Sunday were ``totally
innocent people'' who were off-duty, unarmed, and had nothing to do
with any military operation.
   The IRA's last major attack on the Europeana continent was March
23, 1987. It claimed responsibility for a car-bomb explosion at the
British military headquarters in West Germany at Rheindahlen, 9
miles from the Dutch border, which wounded 31 people.
   In August 1979, an IRA time-bomb went off under a bandstand in a
Brussels square where a British army band was to perform, injuring
seven bandsmen and 11 civilians.
   In March 1979, the British ambassador to the Netherlands, Sir
Richard Sykes, was shot to death outside his residence in the
Hague. The IRA later claimed responsibility.
   The IRA has suffered several setbacks in the past year. Eight
IRA guerrillas were slain in an ambush by Britiish army commandos
at Loughgall in Northern Ireland in May 1987 and it lost 150 tons
of Libyan arms when the trawler Eksund was seized by French
authorities last October.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Richard Clutterbuck, a specialist on
terrorism, said the Holland attacks Sunday would be a ``very easy''
operation for the IRA, noting the servicemens' cars had British
military license plates.
   ``There's no shadow of doubt that the German Red Army faction
would provide safe houses and other facilities for the IRA if they
wanted them, but I don't think the IRA really needs them in Germany
or Holland,'' he said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
   The IRA is believed to have a strong network of support in The
Netherlands. In 1986, Dutch police arrested two IRA guerrillas who
had been involved in a 1983 mass escape from Belfast's Maze prison
and had spent several years in Holland.
   Younger said everything possible would be done to increase
security for British forces abroad.
   In a message addressed to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the
IRA said ``there will be no haven for your military personnel''
unless Britain leaves Northern Ireland.

   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson, campaigning in the face of polls indicating he trails far
behind rival Michael Dukakis in Ohio, said Sunday that he is
``pulling'' Dukakis in his direction on important domestic and
foreign policy issues.
   Jackson brushed off a reporter's question about surveys in the
Akron Beacon Journal and the Columbus Dispatch that suggested he
trails Dukakis by a 3-1 margin.
   `Our campaign of hope continues,'' he said. ``Our support base
gets broader and bigger every day.''
   Jackson vowed to continue his campaign past Tuesday's election
and through to June 7, the end of the primary season.
   Preaching Sunday morning at Olivet Baptist Church, Jackson said
he intended to ``turn up the heat'' in the next five weeks.
   He said he has been asked whether he was pushing Dukakis to come
around to his point of view on key issues.
   ``I'm pulling him,'' Jackson called. ``I am out in front on a
plan to stop the flow of drugs...I am pulling him.''
   ``I'm not pushing folks behind me,'' he said. ``I'm leading
them.''
   Jackson has been portraying Dukakis as unwilling to make strong
statements about what he would do as president. He said Sunday that
leaders cannot afford to play it so safe.
   ``The kitchen is clean and cool,'' he said. ``Ain't nothing
cooking.''
   Jackson preached Sunday sermons to two strikingly contrasting
congregations _ one an all-white audience at Lakewood United
Methodist Church where Gov. Richard Celeste introduced the
candidate, and the other in the all-black Olivet Baptist Church,
which was filled with the sound of a gospel choir.
   Celeste is neutral in the Democratic race and would not say who
would get his vote. He told reporters that both Democrats are
``tremendous candiates.'' But he nodded toward Jackson and said:
``This message right here is the winning message.''
   Jackson spoke about the poverty and homelessness in America,
saying the nation must fight to change the policies that keep
working people and children in poverty.
   Reciting statistics about the increase in the numbers of poor
and homeless people over the last 20 years, Jackson said his goal
is `to comfort the disturbed but also disturb the comfortable.''
   He said budget austerity should not be used as an excuse to hold
back on spending to help the poor.
   ``Don't give up. Leaders have to think ... You've got to have
common sense'' to make cuts in some areas and spend in others, he
said.
   Jackson later traveled to Columbus for a pair of fund-raisers.

   Some 30,000 people walked 20 miles in the rain
Sunday and earned donors' pledges of more than $3 million to feed
the hungry, the organizer of 19th annual Walk for Hunger said.
   ``This community is so committed,'' said Shoshana Pakciarcz,
executive director of Project Bread, which sponsors the annual
fund-raising trek.
   She said the walk is the nation's largest such effort to raise
money to feed the hungry. Last year's event drew 25,000 people and
raised $1.7 million.
   ``When you get really sore, I always say `Jesus walked _ if he
could do it, so could I,'' said Donna Tilton, 46, of Wilmington,
laughing at the end of her five-hour trek.
   Each walker collected pledges from donors who promised to pay a
certain amount for every mile walked. Walkers started at Boston
Common and passed eight checkpoints on the circular route through
Newton, Cambridge and Boston.
   Mrs. Tilton and her husband, Bob, raised $500 between them. They
came armed with six pairs of socks, foot powder, camera and snacks.
   They said they derived encouragement from their fellow
travelers: a blind man led by a sighted friend, a ``walker'' on
roller skates, small children and the elderly, and a former drug
addict who now works in drug rehabilitation.
   ``It was just a good bunch of people, doing something for those
less fortunate,'' said Tilton, 47. ``The hungry will always be with
us.''
   Ms. Pakciarcz gave credit for the increased participation and
pledges to the event's simplicity.
   ``Hunger is such a basic, basic thing. A nation this wealthy
shouldn't have anybody hungry,'' Ms. Pakciarcz said. ``One out of
four children under 6 is poor and hungry and people are just saying
no to hunger.
   ``People come out because we give them an opportunity to do
something they can do, not something abstract.''
   She also said participation has grown since Reagan was elected.
   ``In eight years of the Reagan administration, these (welfare)
programs were all kept even or cut. The walk has grown
substantially since 1980,'' she said.
   Ninety percent of the contributions will go to soup kitchens,
homeless shelters and urban gardens across Massachusetts, and the
rest is sent overseas. For instance, some of the money will go to
build an oven for a village in Haiti.

   The emancipated students at Bryn Mawr
College, a women's college with a capital ``W,'' put down their
feminist literature on May Day to don frilly white dresses and
dance around five Maypoles in a ritual spanning nine decades.
   ``May Day is a kind of bonding for women,'' said Debra Thomas,
college spokeswoman.
   ``Even the nonsense of it is something we need to preserve
because we have become such a technically oriented, career oriented
society that we're almost afraid of the child in ourselves
anymore.''
   Under a bright blue sky and surrounded by the campus'
medieval-style gray stone buildings, 100 women wearing white
dresses and colored sashes paraded to the Maypoles behind college
President Mary Pat McPherson and the senior class president,
mounted on horseback.
   After singing a brief English melody, the women, 20 at each pole
representing the four classes and graduate school, began skipping
and running in a race to be the first group to completely braid a
pole with white and colored ribbons.
   More than 2,000 spectators cheered and jeered, but in the end,
it was the senior class, wearing light blue sashes, that won.
   Some past and current students have looked upon the celebration
of May Day with disdain, prompting one member of the 1953 class to
comment that ending the tradition was necessary ``to speed the
progress of mankind.''
   But the majority of the college's current 1,850 students takes
the tradition in stride, reveling in the chance to breakfast on
strawberries and cream, lunch at lawn picnics and dine at a
medieval banquet.
   It's also a chance for the normally sedate students, considered
among the top in the country academically, to act silly before
final exams.
   Seniors roll hoops in a race on campus, watch spoofs of Greek
and Latin plays and, of course, dance around the Maypole.
   ``I don't think we're worried about the image it presents,''
said Tamara Beauboeuf, 19, of Westtown, N.Y. ``We're not a
finishing school, and we know that. So we don't have to worry about
what people will think about 1,000 women all dressed in white. It's
our day, and we deserve it.''
   The Maypole stems from a European custom in which a fir tree was
stripped of its branches and ornamented with flowers to symbolize
immortality and renewal.
   Previous May Days at the college were so extravagant that
planning started a year in advance and New York designers were
hired to sew the Elizabethan costumes.
   Actress Katherine Hepburn, as a student at the college in 1928,
was the star of a May Day play called ``The Woman In The Moon,''
and that year the entire student body of 500 danced around the
Maypole dressed in white.
   May Day celebrations were abandoned during World War II. But
since then, the college has staunchly continued the annual
pageantry.
   Bryn Mawr is ranked by several surveys as one of the nation's
top ten liberal arts colleges. The college was the first in the
country to offer a Ph.D. to a woman and it leads the country in the
percentage of graduates who go on to earn a Ph.D. in the humanities.

<HEAD>With AM-Chicago Mayor Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry religious leaders said Sunday that an aide
to Mayor Eugene Sawyer should be fired for making comments they
viewed as racial and religious slurs against Jews and Christians.
   But Monroe Anderson, the mayor's press secretary, said there was
only a ``very, very remote'' chance Sawyer would fire Steve Cokely,
an aide who works as a liaison with black nationalist groups.
   In tape-recorded lectures before followers of Nation of Islam
leader Louis Farrakhan, Cokely contended that Jews have a ``secret
society'' and plan to control the world.
   Cokely, 35, also criticized the late Mayor Harold Washington and
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson for employing Jewish advisers,
and he attacked Christianity by calling the cross a symbol of white
supremacy, the Chicago Tribune reported.
   Monsignor John Egan, director of community affairs for DePaul
University, said ``as long as Cokely is there, there is a cancer in
the (mayor's) administration.''
   Michael Kotzin, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, said Sunday that Cokely ``espouses positions that
malign the members of the community in ways that echo some of the
most traditional forms of gutter-level bigotry.''
   ``Any person who expresses these kinds of thoughts should not be
on the city payroll,'' said Kotzin, who said he has heard
recordings of the lectures.
   ``Words aren't mere words, especially words of these kinds. They
truly have the potential to do damage,'' Kotzin said in a telephone
interview.
   Kotzin said he met the mayor four weeks ago and talked with him
about Cokely's ``baseless anti-Jewish and anti-white charges.''
   Anderson, the mayor's spokesman, said Sawyer had decided ``to
talk to Cokely and tell him to tune down his rhetoric,'' but had no
plans to fire him from his $35,568-a-year job as coordinator of
special projects.
   Questioned about the lectures, Cokely said he is not
anti-semitic and that his role as a community activist is to
provoke debate.
   ``I'm responsible for debating various points of view in my role
as a consciousness-raiser,'' he said.
   Rev. David Whitermore, executive director of the Church
Federation of Greater Chicago, said that, based on ``the contacts
that I have had with the mayor in many church services, I can't
conceive of him backing or endorsing anything that has been reputed
to have been said (by Cokely).''

<HEAD>Fistfights, Walkout Mar District Convention in North Carolina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A district GOP convention here turned
into a melee when supporters of presidential candidate Pat
Robertson clashed with backers of Vice President George Bush,
officials said.
   The confrontation came as the district's Republicans were
selecting three delegates to the Republican National Convention in
New Orleans in August.
   Order was restored only after the Franklin County sheriff _ a
Democrat _ and a platoon of deputies arrived at the National Guard
Armory in Louisburg, where the 4th District convention was being
held Saturday night.
   No one was seriously injured, said Sheriff Arthur E. Johnson.
   He said the trouble began when Robertson supporters became angry
when it became apparent that supporters of Vice President George
Bush were not going to allow two county delegations controlled by
Robertson backers to be seated.
   ``This is a fraud,'' shouted Richard Hines of Wake County, the
leader of the Robertson forces. ``This is a railroad ...You are
either going to run this convention correctly or we are going to
run it.''
   A group of Robertson supporters then rushed the podium, and
pandemonium broke out.
   There were at least three fistfights as the Bush and Robertson
forces battled for control, and Calvin Vincent of Franklin County,
the convention's sergeant of arms, was thrown to the floor,
district chairman Larry Norman said.
   After the confrontation, Robertson supporters walked out and
held a separate convention to elect their own three delegates.
   Norman said he was ``very, very, very disappointed'' in the way
things turned out.
   ``I knew we would have a problem,'' Norman said. ``I really
didn't expect anybody to get out of the bounds of civility and
begin attacking people.''

<HEAD>Some Ohio Ballots Won't List Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Ohioans who go the polls Tuesday to
cast votes for their party's presidential nominee won't see the
name of their candidate on the ballot.
   Vice President George Bush, the all-but-certain Republican
nominee, is on all the ballots, as is Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.
   But Democrat Jesse Jackson missed getting on the ballot as a
result of procedural problems in three of the 21 congressional
district ballots.
   Jackson was left off the ballots in the 5th District in
northwest Ohio, the 10th in southeast Ohio and the 13th in
northeast Ohio due to failures by his backers to meet pre-election
filing requirements.
   In those districts, voters will see the name of Sen. Albert Gore
of Tennessee, who suspended his campaign April 21 but technically
remained in the race and is on all ballots.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who dropped from the race, is
still on the ballot in the 10th and 13th Districts, among others.
His 10th and 13th District delegates have promised to support
Jackson if Hart gets enough votes to qualify them as delegates.
Secretary of State Sherrod Brown says there is no statutory basis
for them to do so, but that the Democratic Party could allow it.
   Hart would have to get 15 percent of the votes to get any
delegates in those districts, and he did not do that well in any
state in which he actively campaigned.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who suspended his campaign a month
ago, will be on the ballot in some scattered districts, such as the
4th in northwest Ohio.

<TEXT>
   Police clashed with demonstrators Sunday
in at least 15 cities as thousands of people heeded Solidarity's
call for a national ``day of protest'' on May Day.
   Authorities detained at least 200 people nationwide, according
to Zbigniew Romaszewski, a spokesman for the outlawed Solidarity
union. The violent protests came at the end of a a week of strikes
and the worst labor unrest in Poland since the communist government
suspended Solidarity in December 1981 and later declared it illegal.
   There were scattered reports of injuries but figures were not
available.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban confirmed 90 detentions and
said at least 12,000 people took part in illegal demonstrations
nationwide. Reports from witnesses and opposition spokesmen put the
number at more than 30,000.
   The state-run news agency PAP said more than 9 million people
attended official May Day ceremonies throughout the country and
``attempts to boycott the May Day demonstrations ended up yet again
with a complete fiasco.''
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski took a tough line on wage
demands during ceremonies in Warsaw.
   A strike was in its sixth day at the Lenin steel mill in Nowa
Huta outside Krakow. About 800 strikers gathered for a Mass around
a makeshift altar with a homemade cross in the pressing department.
   Thirty to 50 people outside the gates were detained when they
tried to stage a sympathy march to the plant, which was ringed with
platoons of riot police.
   Earlier, about 3,000 people marched a half-mile from a Roman
Catholic church in Nowa Huta toward the steel mill but followed
police orders to disperse.
   Organizers said about 16,000 workers are on strike at the plant,
demanding recognition of their union rights and an immediate 50
percent raise on the average salary of $105 a month.
   Police withdrew from around the mill in the afternoon. About 120
strikers and 50 family members and friends then had an emotional
meeting at the plant gates.
   Strike leader Andrzej Szewczuwaniec, brushing back tears, vowed
the strike will continue. ``We will not disappoint our wives, our
sons, our mothers,'' he said.
   In the evening in Nowa Huta, 5,000 people rallied at a church
and taunted police, saying: ``So long until the third.''
Anti-government demonstrations occur every May 3, Poland's pre-war
Constitution Day.
   The Lenin mill strike committee on Sunday wrote Deputy Prime
Minister Zdzislaw Sadowski, in charge of the economy and planning,
asking him to negotiate directly because management was unable to
reach an agreement, said Grzegorz Surdy, a spokesman for the
strikers.
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, speaking outside St. Brygida's
Catholic Church in Gdansk, told about 6,000 supporters that the
time had come for them to take a stand in support of the striking
steel workers.
   ``I demand from you solidarity with Nowa Huta tomorrow, in your
shipyards, in your ports and in your factories. I want it to be
effective. Show me tomorrow what you can do,'' he declared.
   He said he was not necessarily calling for strikes. ``It's up to
you to do what you can. ... If you have an army, General Walesa is
at your disposal.''
   Following the Mass and rally in Gdansk, about 500 young
militants tried to march through the city. They were attacked from
two directions by police swinging clubs.
   During a 40-minute melee, protesters hurled rocks and police
beat demonstrators.
   When two police officers ran inside the church to catch
stone-throwers, they were disarmed and beaten by youths.
   Outside, police kicked and beat demonstators and at least four
people were seen bleeding. Dozens were herded into police vans.
   Solidarity, was the only independent labor union movement in the
Soviet bloc when it was created in Gdansk in 1980 during nationwide
strikes. It was suppressed, then outlawed, after martial law was
declared in December 1981.
   The union movement last month called for a ``day of protest''
against price hikes and the lack of union freedoms.
   The demonstrations came after a week in which Poland was hit by
three strikes: one by transit drivers in Bydgoszcz that was settled
Monday; another by heavy machinery factory workers in Stalowa Wola,
resolved Saturday, and the strike in Nowa Huta.
   In the history of Poland's communist government, there has never
been a large-scale strike on May Day.
   Before the start of the capital's May Day parade, Jaruzelski
told a rally, ``Our country is at a turning point now,'' referring
to his economic programs.
   Noting wage demands at a time when the annual inflation rate is
42 percent, he said ``To give more, one has to take away from
somebody else, or produce more.''
   Giving in to unjustified wage demands ``would lead directly to
the infamous epoch of (only) vinegar on store shelves,'' he said
referring to the time of shortages during the Solidarity upheaval.
   He also stressed the Communist Party will remain in charge.
   ``May nobody pin hopes on our fatigue,'' he said. ``There will
be no dismantling of the country's political foundations.''
   At a rally in Warsaw, 6,000 people cheered and shouted slogans
supporting the strikers and condemning the government.
   Some people tried to march from the rally in front of St.
Stanislaw Kostka church to a nearby square, but police blocked
them. Truncheon-swinging officers fought briefly with some
demonstrators.
   In other protests:
   Police used clubs to disperse about 1,000 protesters who tried
to march in the southwestern city of Wroclaw and a dozen people
were detained, said Solidarity spokesman Jozef Pinior.
   In Dabrowa Gornicza in southwestern Poland, some worshippers
attempted to march after a Mass attended by 2,000 people, said
Pinior. He said police moved in and one Solidarity member was
beaten.
   In the central city of Plock, 5,000 people marched behind
Solidarity banners for about a half-mile, Pinior said. Police
scattered them and detained five people.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis holds a
nearly 3-1 lead over Democratic presidential opponent Jesse Jackson
in Ohio's primary contest, two polls suggested Sunday.
   A poll published in The Columbus Dispatch said Dukakis was the
favorite among 62 percent of the 1,974 registered Democrats who
responded to the newspaper's statewide mail survey last week, while
Jackson was the choice of 24 percent. The remaining 14 percent
supported other candidates.
   A University of Akron poll published in the Akron Beacon Journal
gave Dukakis a margin over Jackson of 62 percent to 22 percent
among Democrats who said they were likely to vote.
   The telephone poll of 926 registered Ohio voters was taken
between April 20 and Saturday. It was paid for by the Beacon
Journal and television stations WCMH in Columbus and WKYC in
Cleveland.
   The Columbus poll had an estimated margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points on each result, while the margin for the
Akron poll was 3.5 points.
   The Akron poll indicated that Jackson was finding it hard to
broaden his support beyond a solid core of black supporters. Eleven
percent of white Democrats surveyed in the poll chose Jackson; 82
percent of black Democrats supported him.
   Jackson told reporters in Columbus Sunday he was paying no
attention to the polls.
   ``I'm focusing on our mission, which is to keep America strong
and make America better, and our message, stop drugs from coming
in, stop jobs from going out, re-invest in America,'' Jackson said.
   In Akron, Dukakis quickly shrugged off the favorable survey, and
continued a campaign pace that indicated he was taking nothing for
granted.
   ``I know there's a poll out today. Please ignore it,'' Dukakis
said. ``Pollsters do not vote.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rightist leader Jean-Marie Le Pen told thousands of
his followers Sunday not to help re-elect Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand but he refused to formally endorse conservative
Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Mitterrand and Chirac were the top vote getters in the April 24
presidential balloting and are the only two candidates in the
runoff election next Sunday.
   Le Pen called his anti-immigrant National Front the
``avant-garde'' of France and told his supporters to organize so
``the next time the people will have the last word.''
   About 30,000 people marched in a rain through the heart of Paris
to the rally in the Tuileries Gardens. The demonstration was called
by the National Front to honor Joan of Arc, the party's patron
saint who led the fight in the 15th century against English
invaders.
   ``We are in a position of choosing between the bad and the
worst,'' Le Pen told the crowd in an hour-long speech.
   Mitterrand is the worst and Chirac is the ``residual
candidate,'' he said.
   Le Pen listed three possibilities for his followers: Stay home,
vote for Chirac ``to avoid the worst'' or decide at the last minute
depending on Chirac's statements in the final week of the campaign.
   ``If Jacques Chirac is defeated, he has only himself, his
friends and his allies to blame,'' Le Pen said. ``We have no
responsibility in the voting.''
   Dozens of groups from around France, including monarchists
waving fleur-de-lis flags and war veterans, filed past Le Pen and
the Joan of Arc statue near the Tuileries.
   More than 30,000 people rallied in two counter-marches organized
by different unions to protest Le Pen's rally on May Day, the
traditional territory of organized labor.
   In the past, Le Pen has led marches on May 8, the day
commemorating Joan of Arc. But since the presidential runoff
election is set for May 8 the National Front held the rally a week
early.
   Authorities had feared conflict between the National Front rally
and the labor marches no incidents were reported.
   Le Pen, who won 14.4 percent of the first-round vote on April
24, was eliminated along with seven other candidates.
   But the showing by his extreme right party weakened the
traditional right, and Chirac will need National Front votes to
defeat Mitterrand.
   In the first round, Mitterrand won 34 percent and Chirac
received just under 20 percent. All polls show Mitterrand winning
easily on May 8, drawing between 53 and 57 percent of the votes.
   Since April 24, Chirac has tried to attract Le Pen's followers,
stressing the need to stop immigration and conserve France's
national identity.
   Le Pen claims that France is being drained economically,
socially and culturally because of immigrants from its former
colonies in North Africa.

<HEAD>National Democratic Chairman Assails Reagan Administration Ethics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic National Committee chairman
Paul Kirk on Sunday attacked the ethical standards of the Reagan
administration and challenged the Republicans' nominee-apparent,
George Bush, to speak out on the subject.
   ``When the attorney general of the United States, the country's
No. 1 law enforcement officer, can be cited as `Public Suspect No.
1,' something is wrong,'' Kirk told an audience at the University
of Notre Dame.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese has been the target of a lengthy
criminal investigation, but has not been charged with any crime.
   Kirk said Bush, who has a numerical lock on the Republican
presidential nomination, has failed to consider whether the public
trust is being upheld by the administration in light of criminal
investigations of Meese.
   ``For George Bush, the only calculation is whether the
embarrassment will be so great that his own political opportunities
as a candidate will be undermined,'' Kirk said.
   Kirk's comments came in a Law Day speech delivered the day
before Bush was to make a final campaign swing through South Bend
before Indiana's primary election Tuesday.
   Kirk read a list of 11 top Reagan administration officials,
including Meese, who have resigned under fire or been investigated,
indicted or convicted.
   ``The hall of shame of the administration is crowded, but there
are profiles in courage as well,'' he said, citing two Justice
Department officials who quit, reportedly in protest over Meese's
continued tenure.
   ``But regrettably, among those profiles we cannot include the
president, who waves it off, nor Vice President George Bush, who is
not troubled enough to comment or sufficiently outraged to get
involved,'' he said.
   ``There comes a time when personal cronyism and loyalty to
individuals, and loyalty even to the highest office in the land,
must be replaced by a loyalty to public honor,'' he said.
   Since last May 11, Meese has been the subject of a criminal
investigation by a special prosecutor examining various matters
inlcuding Meese's assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
   Kirk said Bush campaigners searching for skeletons in the closet
during Dukakis's terms as governor of Massachusetts will find
nothing comparable to the misdeeds of the Reagan administration.
   ``It's a no-win political tactic on their part,'' he said.
   Reagan has defended Meese and the Justice Department despite
being told by some resigning department officials that ``a deep
malaise'' had set in and that Meese should be indicted.

   With 33,000 bananas, 2,500 gallons of

anything is possible,''' said Kelly Stoops, a teacher who was in
charge of organizing the event to raise money for a community
development organization in Selinsgrove, a central Pennsylvania
town of 5,500.
   Selinsgrove set the Guinness record for the world's longest
banana street in 1982 with a 1.5-mile spectacle, but was overtaken
in 1983, by New York high school students, who in turn were outdone
by Zeta Beta Tau Sorority at Bowling Green University in Ohio,
which created a 4-mile banana split in 1985.

   The army suspended an officer after troops
under his command shot and killed a Palestinian Sunday during a
stone-throwing demonstration in the occupied West Bank.
   Troops using live ammunition and rubber bullets also wounded 13
Arabs on Sunday, a ``day of confrontation'' called by leaders of
the uprising in the occupied territories. An Associated Press
photographer was hit by a rubber bullet and an Arab-thrown rock in
two separate incidents.
   In other developments:
   _Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said a marked
decline in violent incidents in the last week showed the
5-month-old rebellion was waning.
   _Israeli Arabs in the biblical town of Nazareth dedicated their
May Day parade to the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
``Palestine, two countries for two peoples,'' read banners carried
by some of the thousands of Arabs who gathered in the city.
   The fatal shooting occurred in the village of Fakua when
Palestinian demonstrators hurled rocks at soldiers who moved in to
clear away roadblocks, burning tires and Palestinian flags, an army
spokesman said.
   Palestinian officials at a clinic in Jenin identified the man
killed as 22-year-old Naim Yusuf Mahmoud Abu Farha.
   The army suspended the officer in command of the patrol, the
army spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping
with regulations.
   Military sources said they were investigating whether the
soldiers had been too quick to open fire.
   Abu Farha was the 176th Palestinian killed by Israelis in
violence since Dec. 8, the beginning of the uprising in the lands
Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. Two Israelis
have been killed.
   Troops clashed with Arab protesters Sunday in four refugee camps
in the Gaza Strip and in at least two towns in the West Bank.
   In the Gaza Strip, an army spokesman said a 10-year-old boy from
the Khan Yunis refugee camp was admitted to Nasser hospital with a
gunshot wound. He said the army was investigating the incident.
   Hospital officials said two teenagers and a 22-year-old man
suffered bullet wounds in their legs after soldiers opened fire
during a demonstration in the Shati refugee camp.
   Arab witnesses and hospital officials said at least four Arabs
were injured by rubber bullets, two in the Khan Yunis refugee camp
and two in the Jabaliya refugee camp. The army said it was checking
the reports.
   In the West Bank, a Palestinian was shot and wounded at Beit
Sahour, near the town of Bethlehem, after he fled from an army
checkpoint, the army spokesman said.
   At Deir Azun, a village near Tulkarem in the West Bank, soldiers
opened fire after protesters blocked the road and threw stones, an
army spokesman reported. He said four Arabs were slightly wounded.
   AP photographer Laurent Rebours was hit in the back by a rubber
bullet as he photographed a stone-throwing incident at Beit Sahour
and by a rock thrown by Arab demonstrators in Ramallah.
   Sunday's protests were in response to a leaflet distributed last
week by Arab underground leaders. The leaflet called on
Palestinians to make May Day ``a day of confrontation with
occupation forces and demonstrations in the villages and the
cities.''
   The leaflet also called on Palestinians ``to strike the severest
blows'' against Israeli-appointed Arab officials who had not
resigned, as ordered by leaders of the rebellion.
   There was no word of any attacks on the officials.
   Shomron told Israel radio the rebellion was fading.
   ``In my opinion, the residents in the territories understand
today that there is no chance of success by this method of
intefadeh,'' he said, using the Arabic term for uprising.
   ``I think they have come to understand, on their own, that the
Arab countries are not helping, and although the great big world
does television stories, beyond this they will not get help,'' he
said.
   The CBS television bureau chief in Tel Aviv, Terry Plantinga,
said Sunday that the network would protest the beating of one of
its Israeli cameramen in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   Plantinga said a soldier struck cameraman Amnon Eventov with a
rifle and smashed the window of his car Saturday.
   It was the third time a CBS camera crew had been assaulted by
soldiers in the occupied territories since January, Plantinga said.
   In Tel Aviv, 200,000 Israelis and tourists from 25 countries
crowded the route of a two-mile May Day parade.
   The annual march was sponsored by the Histadrut Labor
Federation, the nationwide trade union, which is an ally of Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres' left-center Labor Party.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc boycotted
the festivities as too extravagant. Israel's budget has been
strained by the cost of extra forces in the occupied territories.

   A ferry company crippled by a 13-week
walkout by its union workers sailed its first strike-breaking
vessel to Belgium Sunday and the ship then headed back to England.
   A group of spectators watched from the cliffs of Dover as the
blue and white Pride of Bruges, with the P and O European Ferries
emblem on its side, left the harbor and entered the English
Channel. It arrived about 4{ hours later in Zeebrugge, Belgium.
   The ferry carried about a dozen freight trucks, a handful of
passengers, and a crew of 80 defying the strike.
   Some pickets had taunted the crewmen with shouts of ``Scab!''
when they arrived early Sunday at the dock to board the Pride of
Bruges for the voyage to Zeebrugge. The crewmen were taken to the
vessel in four buses with a police escort.
   P and O Director Sir Jeffrey Sterling, addressing the crew on
board the ship before it sailed, said he would not accept
intimidation by strikers. ``We know what we are doing is right,''
he said.
   He accompanied the ferry in a helicopter as the vessel headed to
sea and met it in Zeebrugge when it moored.
   Despite threats that unions on the European continent would
refuse to handle P and O ferries, the Belgian mooring party worked
without hesitation. The ship later sailed for Dover carrying 50
vehicles and 117 passengers, P and O said.
   The Pride of Bruges and its sister ship, the Pride of Kent,
arrived at Dover on Saturday from the Dutch port of Rotterdam,
where they had been kept since the dispute began. Company officials
gave no indication Sunday when the Pride of Kent might sail.
   The National Union of Seamen is striking over a plan by P and O
to reduce staff, impose longer shifts and increase responsibilities
for workers. The company moves are aimed at cutting costs in
preparation for increased competition from the Channel Tunnel
between England and France, which is to open in 1993.
   Sam McCluskie, general secretary of the 24,400-member National
Union of Seamen, said a telex had been sent to every British ship
at sea calling for support for the strikers.
   The company fired 720 strikers last week and said 1,100 P and O
seamen had accepted its new terms. But union spokesman Colin
Bennett said Sunday that 180 of those who had agreed to work had
since withdrawn and ``are back on the right side.''
   The union said almost 5,000 members working at ports throughout
the country were now on strike because of the dispute. Some
strikers were sympathetic members of P and O's British channel
competitor, Sealink.
   Foreign ferries continued sailing, and Dover port authorities
said Sunday there was virtually no delay for tourist traffic. Truck
drivers were still subject to delays of up to 15 hours for
crossings to Calais, France, and Ostend, Belgium.

   Demonstrators burned effigies of
President Reagan and Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo as
thousands of people joined Sunday in May Day rallies and marches.
   Newspapers estimated some 30,000 people took part in the rallies
in the capital and five other cities, and many of the traditional
marches turned into demonstrations against the government and the
United States.
   About 20 students at a rally called by the leftist Unified
Workers Federation beat and kicked Associated Press photographer
Obdulio Lobo, took several rolls of his film and damaged his camara.
   Lobo, a Honduran, suffered no substantial injuries in the attack
by students from the Revolutionary University Front in Tegucigalpa.
Human Rights Commission President Ramon Custodio, who was at the
demonstration, apologized to Lobo for the attack.
   Demonstrators there and at other rallies hurled oranges and
insults at both Honduran and foreign photographers.
   At some of the rallies people burned American and Honduran
flags, copies of the Honduran constitution and effigies of Reagan,
Azcona Hoyo and armed forces chief Gen. Regalado Hernandez.
   Some teachers and government employees joined union members and
students in the protests. They chanted soch slogans as, ``The
government of Azcona is useless,'' ``The United States is meddling
in the problems of Honduras'' and ``If the Contras don't go,
they'll die in Honduras.'' The slogans rhyme in Spanish.
   An estimated 6,000 soldiers and police were on duty but they did
not intervene.
   Violent anti-American protests took place after Juan Ramon
Matta, 43, accused of being an international cocaine trafficker,
was arrested and quickly flown out of the country April 5 in a move
by Honduran authorities working closely with U.S. officials. He is
now in the federal penetentiary in Marion, Ill.
   The constitution prohibits extradition of Hondurans.
   ``We demand respect for our constitution and punishment for
those who have violated it,'' said Carlos Reyes, vice president of
the Unified Workers Federation and one of the labor leaders to
speak at the rallies. ``We also demand the departure of American
troops and the dismantling of their bases in Honduras.''
   The government transmitted frequent statements on radio stations
expressing concern over ``the threatening attitude of extreme
leftist groups that are trying to provoke disorder and vandalism
with the goal of increasing tension and causing social
decomposition in the country.''
   The United States maintains a force of about 1,100 troops in
Honduras and several thousand others, in rotation moves,
participate in joint exercises and projects every few months.
   Many U.S.-supplied Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras have
operated from bases on the Honduran side of the border since they
began fighting Nicaragua's lewft-wing government in 1981.

   The West German train clocked a top speed of 243 mph on a new
track between Hanover and Wuerzburg.
   The speed beat the world record of 228 mph set in 1981 by
France's High-Speed Train.
   Aboard the train were Transport minister Juergen Warnke,
Research and Science Minister Heinz Riesenhuber and officials of
the federal railways. There were no regular passengers.
   The train is part of a program to provide faster service between
the West Germany's major cities.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis on Sunday called
George Bush ``a blank slate'' in a Republican administration that
has violated and ignored the law and said the vice president will
have to begin speaking out on those issues.
   Dukakis, who tried to brush aside a fresh poll showing him with
an overwhelming lead in Ohio's Democratic presidential primary,
took aim at Bush, the expected Republican nominee, on a day in
which he toured a police station in Akron, Ohio, to underscore his
criticism of the Reagan administration's efforts to fight crime and
drugs.
   At a news conference later in Cleveland, Dukakis said the nation
has gone through seven years under Reagan ``in which rule of law
and respect for the constitution have not been the order of the
day.''
   Asked to describe Bush's role, he said: ``I'm not sure I can
answer what that role has been, frankly, because he's such a blank
slate.
   ``One doesn't know. I hope we'll learn as time goes on. But
we've had repeated violations of law. We've had repeated efforts to
play fast and loose with the law, to ignore congressional
mandates,'' Dukakis said. ``You've got a Justice Department tht is
rapidly becoming a laughingstock, and I would assume at some point
he's going to speak out on those issues. Until now he has not.''
   Dukakis earlier walked through a Polish neighborhood of
Cleveland in a parade.
   Earlier, at the Akron police department, he spoke with officers
at their morning roll call, and examined confiscated weapons and
drugs.
   Later, in Toledo, Dukakis visited the county jail and met with
the Lucas County sheriff.
   ``If the law enforcement officers who we ask to risk their lives
in this fight aren't getting the support and training and equipment
and encouragement they need ... we're going to lose that fight,''
he said in Akron.
   Dukakis said the administration had cut back on spending to
combat drugs, and he attacked the administration for dealing with
drug dealers in the Iran-Contra affair, and with Panama strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We have an administration that has been doing business with
the drug-running Panamanian dictator, that's been furnishing aid to
the Contras through convicted drug dealers that are doing time in
federal penitentiaries,'' he said.
   ``How do we tell our kids to say no to drugs when we have an
administration that can't say no to drugs and drug dealers?''
   Dukakis spoke on the steps of the Akron police station to a
small noontime crowd of about 150 people. The small size of his
audience was in contrast to the huge support shown for him in a
poll released Sunday by the Akron Beacon-Journal newspaper.
   That poll of Ohio residents showed Dukakis with a nearly 3-1
lead over Jesse Jackson _ 62 percent to 22 percent _ with 16
percent undecided and a 3.5 percent margin of error. The poll was
conducted over 10 days beginning April 20.
   Dukakis appeared with prominent local Democrats, including Rep.
Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, and Mayor Don Plusquellic, who remain
officially neutral in the primary battle between Dukakis and
Jackson.
   Dukakis has repeatedly urged supporters to ignore the poll,
reminding them of his 1978 re-election loss and the penchant of his
favorite baseball team, the Boston Red Sox, for blowing big leads.
   ``I know there is a poll out today. Please ignore it,'' Dukakis
said. ``Forget about the polls. ... It is not over.''
   At the police station, Dukakis saw confiscated automatic
weapons, guns, switchblades, and an array of drugs including
cocaine and marijuana. he promised his support for local law
enforcement efforts and said Massachusetts had the largest drop in
crime, with one exception, of any state in the last several years.
   Dukakis renewed his denunciation of President Reagan's plans to
veto trade legislation because of a provision requiring companies
to give 60 days notice beford closing plants.
   In a fresh attack, he said that Secretary of State George
Shultz, as a labor economist 20 years ago had suggested in a book
that displaced workers need six months to a year to adjust to the
loss of their jobs.
   ``Maybe the secretary of state and president ought to have a
conversation,'' Dukakis said. ``and maybe the secretary can help
the White House understand the trauma and the agony and pain of
being laid off.''

   A speeding car smashed into a U.S. Navy
van at the Guantanamo Navy base, killing five sailors and their
driver and injuring four people, officials said Sunday.
   The car's driver, who is not a U.S. citizen, was charged with
six counts of manslaughter after the wreck Saturday night and was
under guard at the base hospital, said Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Long,
spokesman at Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va.
   Identities of the dead and injured were not immediately
available, said base spokesman Lt. Bob Hines.
   ``There was a fire involved in the accident,'' Hines said by
telephone. ``It's making identification (of the bodies) difficult.''
   Long said the names of the dead and injured would not be
released until their relatives had been notified.
   He said the three injured sailors were evacuated Sunday
afternoon to the Brooke Army Burn Center in San Antonio, Texas. He
said they were in serious condition but did not elaborate.
   All the fatalities occurred inside the taxi van, which was
operated by the base's retail exchange. It was more heavily damaged
by fire than the car, Hines said.
   Long said the dead included five Navy personnel and the driver
of the van, a civilian employee at the base. He said the fourth
person injured, the driver of the private car, was in stable
condition at the base hospital.
   A base security vehicle observed the private vehicle speeding
about 1{ miles before it crashed into the van at 8:35 p.m. on
Sherman Avenue, the main road on the base, according to Long. The
security vehicle followed the private vehicle but could go no
faster than 40 mph, he said.
   ``The vehicle outran the naval station vehicle,'' but the
accident was not a result of ``hot pursuit,'' he said. ``The
security vehicle did not see the accident occur.''
   Long said the speed limit on the base is 25 mph.
   About 7,000 people, including military personnel and civilian
workers, live on the base at the eastern tip of communist Cuba. The
facility, which is enclosed and surrounded by a minefield, serves
as the main training site for the Atlantic Fleet.

   President Daniel Ortega told a May Day
rally Sunday that his troops would launch their largest military
offensive ever if rebels do not agree to extend a cease-fire into a
permanent truce.
   On Saturday, government and rebel leaders ended three days of
talks in Managua without making significant progress. The
Sandinistas and rebels, known as Contras, agreed only to meet again
but they didn't set a date or place.
   ``Contras Uncompromising,'' a banner headline in the Sandinista
newspaper Barricada said Sunday. The story said the latest
negotiations ended ``without a single concrete result.''
   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega, the head of the
government's delegation and brother of the president, had said
Saturday there was some progress. He also said the negotiators had
agreed to meet again on May 12 at a still to be decided place.
   But that was disputed by Aristides Sanchez, a Contra spokesman.
He told reporters Saturday no date had been set for the next round
and the rebel negotiators would not return to Managua.
   The Contras had inisted the political talks be held in the
capital, and that was resisted for months by the Sandinistas.
   But Sanchez said, ``We won't return to Managua while there is a
climate of tension. There is not a favorable environment to talk in
Managua.''
   President Ortega said Sunday that future talks had to be in
Nicaragua but he did not specify Managua.
   The discussions are to define details of the March 23 cease-fire
pact signed after three days of negotiations at the southern border
post at Sapoa. It established a 60-day cease fire that took effect
April 1.
   But hopes of ending the six years of fighting have dimmed as
negotiators have been unable to agree on implementing the March
accords.
   On Friday the Contras turned down a Sandinista request to extend
the cease-fire another 30 days after May 30.
   The president told thousands of people at the rally to maintain
their guard.
   ``We have to be prepared because on May 30 if we haven't arrived
at an agreement, we are going to launch a large _ the largest
military offensive against the mercenary forces,'' he said.
   No major battle actions have been reported since the cease-fire
began.
   Opposition political parties and unions staged two peaceful May
Day marches in Managua.
   In one demonstration some marchers carried signs saying,
``Against Government Repression!'' and ``We Want Work, Not Military
Service!''
   Meanwhile, more than 30 construction workers and car mechanics
were in the seventh day of a hunger strike at a union hall. Police
were stationed outside the buidling and said it was ``prohibited
for passersby or working news media representatives to get close to
the building.''
   Police have detained about 40 people since last Monday for
protesting at the hall, headquarters of the General Workers
Federation. The federation is a coalition of socialist
anti-government unions.
   About 1,500 construction workers and auto mechanics walked off
their jobs at the end of February to demand higher wages.

<TEXT>
   A doorman and a workman contracted Legionnaires'
disease after working in British Broadcasting Corp. buildings, and
three more cases were suspected, the BBC said Sunday.
   Air conditioning systems in the main Broadcasting House in
central London and the BBC's nearby Duchess Street building were
cleaned, along with any other possible sources of infection, BBC
said.
   ``On the advice of the Public Health Laboratory Service,'' the
BBC said in a broadast Sunday, ``potential sources of Legionnaires'
disease are being disinfected.''
   The company checked the buildings after the two men developed
symptoms of the disease. They were sent to hospitals for testing
and their cases were confirmed, the company said.
   The suspected cases affect two BBC staff and one other person
who had been in the vicinity, the BBC said. No further information
about the victims was available.
   Legionnaires' disease produces symptoms similar to pneumonia and
is often caused by bacteria from water-cooled air conditioning
units.
   The illness was first diagnosed in July 1976 after 221 people
contracted it in Philadelphia at a convention of the Pennsylvania
American Legion. Thirty-four of the victims died.
   Doctors in the United States say Legionnaires' disease has
proved fatal in about 15 percent of cases.
   The BBC on Sunday broadcast an appeal for information ``on
anyone who has pneumonia or suspected Legionnaires' disease and who
has been in this area within the last two weeks.''

   Demonstrators linked to the Shining Path
guerrilla movement threw sticks of dynamite at two banks and other
buildings during a May Day march through the capital Sunday.
   About 100 marchers belonging to a radical labor group linked to
the Maoist guerrillas marched on a main avenue shouting
anti-government slogans. Protesters hurled dynamite at two banks,
an insurance company's offices and a sporting goods shop, police
said.
   Seven sticks of the dynamite exploded, shattering windows of
several buildings and chipping walls. No one was reported hurt.
   Police said they deactivated two small bombs left by the
demonstrators.
   The marchers plastered doors and lamp posts with dozens of red
posters carrying the communist symbol of the hammer and sickle. The
posters commemorated May Day and urged workers to join the ``armed
struggle''against the government.
   Police converged on the area when the dynamite exploded and the
marchers scattered, witnesses said.
   Since last year the Shining Path has been working to infiltrate
and control unions, a new step in the group's efforts to undercut
the elected governement, according to counterinsurgency officials.
   More than 10,000 people, mainly highland peasenats have been
killed since Shining Path launched its insurgency in May 1980.

<HEAD>Israeli Judge Discusses War Crimes Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli judge who presided over
the conviction of John Demjanjuk of war crimes said Sunday that the
public trial would help prevent a repetition of the Nazi Holocaust.
   The decision to prosecute Demjanjuk, a former Ohio autoworker,
was particularly important in light of recent criticism of Israel's
treatment of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territory, said
Israeli Supreme Court Justice Dov Levin.
   ``When a pure and enlightened movement like Zionism is equated
with rascism, (the holocaust) could happen again,'' he said.
   The trial, in which Demjanjuk was accused by survivors of being
a death camp guard called Ivan the Terrible, reawakened memories of
Adolf Hitler's program to exterminate Jews and will help insure the
tragedy does not happen again, Dov said at the Fourth Annual Israel
Symposium at Beth El Temple here.
   Levin, 62, presided over a three-judge panel that sentenced
Demjanjuk to death last week. The only other person executed in
Israel's 40-year history was Adolf Eichmann, who directed the
extermination program. He was tried and hanged in 1962.
   Levin said he was convinced of Demjanjuk's guilt.
   Survivors of the Treblinka concentration camp in occupied Poland
remembered every moment of their meetings with Demjanjuk, he said.
They testified that he went beyond his duty, whipping and slashing
terrified prisoners on their way to the gas chambers.
   ``They dream about it,'' he said. ``That is why we were
convinced they remember everything.''
   Demjanjuk's attorneys argued their client, a Ukrainian Orthodox
Christian, was the victim of mistaken identity.
   Levin also said he was satisfied Demjanjuk received a fair
hearing at his 14-month trial. ``We are professional judges,'' he
said.
   Some Israelis expressed concern that the emotional courtroom
scene, in which many observers cheered and chanted for death after
his sentencing, lent credence to defense claims that Demjanjuk
could not receive a fair trial in Israel.

   The New York City Ballet entered the second week
of its three-week American Music Festival on Sunday with the odd,
nightmarish ``Archetypes,'' with ballerinas in clown masks and men
dressed as admirals.
   In Part 1, the ballerinas in masks take Heather Watts from her
partner, Jock Soto, and when he sees her again she has become like
all of them. He runs. In Part 2, men in three-piece suits with
briefcases are vaguely menaced by men in leotards and ski masks.
   Part 3 starts amusingly as Miss Watts' black coat is whisked
into the air, leaving her in underwear. She dances a long, sensual
duet with Soto, in admiral's uniform and gray hair. He tosses away
his elderly wig but instead of a happy ending, other admirals carry
him away and her coat flies back and she leaves. Part 4 started
fast and passionate and ended with what looked like a gang fight.
   Dancers looked as though they needed more rehearsal.
   Paul Schwartz composed the music on commission from the New York
City Ballet. Choreographer Robert Weiss, formerly of the New York
City Ballet, wrote a program note saying his ballet was inspired by
paintings by Jonathan Borofsky.
   The second ballet of the evening was Jerome Robbins' wonderful,
amusing ``Fancy Free'' to music by Leonard Bernstein from 1944.
   The evening in the New York State Theater ended with Lars
Lubovitch's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' to the famous Gershwin music,
which was danced on the festival's opening night.
   The principal male part looks as though it was choreographed for
rangy Christopher d'Amboise, who isn't with the company any more.
   The movement is the kind of free, wide-kicking, fast-spinning,
high-lifting dancing that says America, from cheerleaders to
barndancers. It's the energetic movement of a big country.

<TEXT>
   A conscientious objector who had been
given his last rites called off a 68-day hunger strike Sunday after
the government pledged to reform the law on military service, his
support committee said.
   Michalis Marangakis, 31-year-old wood carver from the northern
city of Salonica, started the hunger strike February 22 while
serving a 26-month sentence for refusing to serve in the army.
   Marangakis said he wouldn't eat until the government established
an alternative option to mandatory military service, such as social
work.
   Last month he was transferred from a military jail to the Athens
401 Military Hospital after losing 61 pounds. His weight dropped
from 198 pounds to 136 pounds during the hunger strike.
   On Saturday, Marangakis was reported in critical condition and
received the last rites from a Greek Orthodox priest, Theodoros
Michalopoulos, a member of the Greek Committee for Conscientious
Objectors, told the Associated Press by telephone.
   He said Defense Undersecretary Stathis Yiotas visited Marangakis
in hospital on Sunday and gave him ``a written assurance the law
would be altered.''
   A government statement issued Sunday said only that legislation
on military service for conscientious objectors will be reviewed.
   A law passed by Parliament in February and due to take effect in
September will permit conscientious objectors to serve four years
in the armed services as non-combatants instead of the regular
two-year stint.
   But the law makes no provision for alternative service by
conscientious objectors who refuse to join the armed forces.

   Contra leaders returned from a second round of
stalled peace talks Sunday blaming Sandinista government for
reneging on promises and creating an oppressive atmosphere that
jeopardizes future talks in Nicaragua.
   ``It's obvious the Sandinistas have gone backward on their
promises and don't have any intention of fulfilling the agreement
we signed in Sapoa,'' said Contra leader Adolfo Calero after
returning here from Managua.
   Calero said he hoped the next round of talks tentatively planned
for May 12-14 will be held in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic or
Costa Rica because of Sandinista restrictions on personal freedoms
inside Nicaragua.
   ``They have been carrying on a succession of repressive actions
against the people of Nicaragua,'' Calero said.
   Sandinista police on Friday cordoned off the entrance to an
anti-government workers union where about 1,500 construction
workers were protesting economic measures enacted a week earlier.
   Also Friday, Jose Castillo Osejo, director of the
anti-Sandinista Radio Corporation, claimed Interior Minister Tomas
Borge summoned him to his office, berated Radio's reporting of the
demonstrations and punched him in the mouth.
   Calero also said Contra negotiators were forced to stay in their
hotel ``like it's a prison.''
   Calero and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, two of the five-member
Nicaraguan Resistance directorate who met with reporters here,
denied a government announcement in Managua Saturday that some
rebel leaders were staying to continue talks.
   ``We all got on the bus at the airport and left, you could have
taken a group picture,'' Chamorro said. ``There's no need for
anybody to stay. We'll be back.''
   The talks are hung up on the workings of the cease-fire
agreement signed in Sapoa, Nicaragua, March 23. The pact calls for
Contra forces to enter truce zones, after which the government is
to free 700 political prisoners and allow Contras to join talks
with Nicaraguan political parties.
   During the truce, Contra forces may receive humanitarian
supplies. But rebel leaders say the latest round of talks stalled
over how that food, clothing and medicine would be delivered.
   The Contras Friday rejected a Sandinista proposal that the
International Committee of the Red Cross re-supply the rebels.
   Chamorro said Red Cross in Nicaragua is ``just another arm of
the Sandinista government.'' He preferred that a private carrier
agreeable to both sides bring in the goods.
   The rebels also turned down a government proposal to extend by a
month the 60-day cease-fire that began April 1, saying the offer
showed a lack of good will to fulfill the Sapoa agreement.

<HEAD>Investigator: Few Aircraft As Badly Damaged As Aloha Jet Have
Landed Safely</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 6-7 ``Meanwhile Sunday'' to UPDATE with Coast
Guard search failing to find anything. Picks up 8th graf pvs

<TEXT>
   The pilot of an Aloha Airlines jetliner
that blew open at 24,000 feet landed safely even though he had lost
power in one engine and had no indication the nose wheel was down,
a federal investigator said.
   The pilot also was not able to lower the plane's flaps, used to
slow the craft, into normal landing position, so he touched down at
Kahului Airport at a speed of about 195 mph and braked heavily,
investigator Joseph Nall said late Saturday. Normal landing speed
is 155 mph, he added.
   The plane, with 89 passengers, five crew members and an air
traffic controller aboard, was on an inter-island hop from Hilo to
Honolulu Thursday when 20 feet of its upper fuselage peeled away
explosively.
   Flight attendant Clarabelle Lansing, 57, apparently was sucked
from the cabin to her death and 61 others were injured.
   Seven passengers remained at Maui Memorial Hospital Sunday in
stable condition with burns and lacerations, nursing supervisor
Beverly Perreira said.
   Meanwhile Sunday, a Coast Guard helicopter search for the
missing chunk of fuselage in waters off the Maui coast failed to
find any trace of the wreckage, Coast Guard spokesman Dan
Waldschmidt said.
   ``We believe there's a good chance the piece in almost it's
entirety is floating in the ocean,'' Mike Benson, spokesman for the
National Transportation and Safety Board, said earlier.
   Federal investigators have focused on possible structural
failure in the aging Boeing 737 as a cause of the accident.
   Nall, of the NTSB, said at a news conference that investigators
have begun looking at the plane's maintenance records and have
asked Boeing for all safety advisories issued for that model.
   Boeing had issued five service bulletins, including one in
April, warning airlines to check 737s for corroding fasteners that
hold pieces of the fuselage together, company officials said.
   Last Oct. 5, the FAA ordered close inspection of the upper skin
of the early model Boeing 737s because routine inspections had
turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap,
officials said Friday. The agency warned the problem could cause
rapid cabin decompression, they said.
   Stephanie Ackerman, an Aloha Airlines spokeswoman, said
inspections carried out because of the FAA order turned up nothing
unusual.
   The Federal Aviation Administration barred the oldest versions
of the 737 from flying above 23,000 feet if they have had more than
55,000 landings. The Aloha jet had logged between 85,000 and 90,000
landings.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the order would affect 66 planes
in the 737-100 and 737-200 series. The jets are operated by Aloha,
Piedmont and American airlines, he said.
   Aloha grounded its three planes affected by the order and was
forced to cancel 30 to 40 flights a day, or 20 percent to 25
percent of its schedule.
   According to interviews with the flight crew that were released
Saturday, the craft was traveling at 322 mph to 333 mph with the
first officer, Mimi Tompkins, at the controls, Nall said.
   Suddenly the crew heard a ``whooshing'' sound, Nall said, and
Capt. Robert Schornstheimer took over the controls as the crew
donned oxygen masks.
   The plane bounced as it began its emergency descent, he said.
There was so much noise in the cockpit that Schornstheimer and
Tompkins had to use hand signals to communicate, he added.
   The jet's left engine had no power when the plane began to slow
to 195 mph, and Schornstheimer found the plane became unstable if
it went any slower, Nall said.
   Schornstheimer decided to land the plane even though a green
light that indicates when the nose wheel is down did not function,
Nall said.
   An inspection of the interior of the Aloha jet found no traces
of a fire, and none of the crew or passengers interviewed reported
seeing a fire or smelling smoke, Nall said.
   Overall, however, ``the airplane was extensively damaged,'' Nall
said. ``Few aircraft with damage that extensive have ever been
landed safely.''
   Nall said five beams that run across the width of the plane and
support the floor of the passenger cabin were broken. The beams
carry cables that control the wings and tail of the plane, and one
of those cables also was broken, Nall said.

   Searching for new ways to cut federal
spending, Congress may finally be ready to butcher one of its most
sacred cows _ outdated and unneeded military bases.
   ``We no longer need to guard the Pony Express routes to the Wild

assault by British sailing ships,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
   ``We all know why these unnecessary bases have been kept open,''
Roth said. ``They have been maintained for selfish political
reasons in order to maintain a flow of defense dollars into our
states. But the budgetary good times are gone. We simply cannot
justify throwing money away.''

   George Bush says there ``isn't a short list,

indicates with some understatement that he wants to use less frenzy
in the selection than Ronald Reagan did eight years ago.
   ``I hope I'll make as good a choice but I'll use a different
method,'' says the vice president, who clinched enough delegates
last week to put a lock on the Republican presidential nomination.
   Bush was an 11th hour compromise at the 1980 convention after a
chaotic few days during which Reagan toyed with the idea of sharing
the ticket with former President Gerald Ford.

   A grand jury will release its findings on
criminal intent this week in the police bombing three years ago of
the radical group MOVE in which 11 people died and 61 homes were
destroyed by a resulting fire.
   Police arranged the bombing of the barricaded and heavily
fortified row house on May 13, 1985, in an attempt only to evict
the MOVE followers. Neighbors had complained to city officials and
threatened to take matters into their own hands if nothing was done
about the group.
   Members of the mysterious group, whose name did not stand for
anything in particular, championed back-to-nature rituals, lived in
filth, refused to send their children to school, and openly
disobeyed health and safety laws, authorities said.

that even the nation's poorest state can take those who have never
had a steady job or who haven't worked in years off the dole.
   While Congress debated the most comprehensive welfare reform
bill in 50 years, Mississippi Department of Public Welfare
officials lauded their program for turning workfare jobs into
paying employment for 109 of the 765 food stamp recipients
participating so far.
   Welfare recipients, they said, may be pulling themselves up by
their own bootstraps largely because of the state's poverty.

   China's march to a freer market economy is
slowing, and its reform-minded leaders are at odds over how much
further to go, the Central Intelligence Agency said in a report
released Sunday.
   ``One assessment of the current state of reforms is that China
now risks stalling out halfway on the road to a market economy,''
the CIA said in a report to Congress that was released by the Joint
Economic Committee.
   ``Although all Chinese leaders now consider themselves
reformers, a consensus over the ultimate shape of a reformed China
is notably lacking,'' the CIA said.
   The report, which examined all sections of the Chinese economy,
said it turned in a mixed performance last year.
   ``Chinese statistics indicate a substantial decline in the trade
deficit, high industrial growth and improved labor productivity,''
the report said. But it added that those favorable developments
were countered by increased inflation, slow growth in real income
in Chinese cities, disappointing grain production increases and
higher state subsidies to manufacturing enterprises, trading
corporations and big city consumers.
   In 1988, the CIA said, Peking is stressing efforts to reduce
inflation, increase profits of its enterprises and increase grain
output.
   ``Crucial but politically sensitive price reforms will proceed
slowly in order to minimize economic dislocations among
consumers,'' it said.
   The report said China's real gross national product rose by 9.4
percent in 1987, up from a 7.8 percent increase in 1986 but below
double-digit growth rates in 1984 and 1985.
   Chinese exports to the United States rose by a third in 1987,
reflecting the success of an export-push policy.
   But while U.S. sales to China rose by 12 percent _ recovering
from a slump in 1986 _ they remained below 1985 records.
   The result was that the U.S. trade deficit with China widened to
$3.4 billion, 60 percent higher than in 1986, the CIA said.
   Turning to defense, the CIA estimated that China spent about $12
billion on its military forces in 1986, about twice what the
Chinese government publicly reported.
   But it said that figure represents an overall declining trend in
military spending both as a share of the overall Chinese budget as
well as a share of China's gross national income.
   ``CIA estimates indicated that defense expenditures accounted
for about one third of China's total budget in 1978, and only
one-fifth of the budget in 1987,'' the report said.
   ``Moreover, we estimate that China's defense spending dropped
from 12 percent of gross national income in 1978 to only 5 percent
in 1987.
   That compares to 7 percent for the United States last year and
an estimated 20 percent to 25 percent for the Soviet Union.
   ``China has cut military spending by slashing personnel costs
and postponing the procurement of most major weapons,'' the CIA
said.
   It reported cuts of more than 3 million men since 1977.
   Overall, it said that China's military operating budget has
declined by about a fifth over the last eight years.
   Chinese purchases of weapons declined by about 10 percent
between 1978 and 1986, the agency said, because of decisions to
postpone major purchases until more technologically advanced
weapons systems become available.
   But it said spending on research, development and testing have
increased by about 25 percent over the last decade.

Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANDOVER, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dart Group Corp. posted a sharply lower
profit in its fourth fiscal quarter, and said the stock market
crash was the main factor in its annual loss of $19.7 million.
   Dart, the retailing company that serves as a takeover vehicle
for its controlling Haft family, reported a profit of $1.4 million,
or 74 cents a share, in the three months ended Jan. 31. That
compared with a profit of $11.4 million, or $6.05 per share, in the
same period a year earlier.
   Fourth quarter revenue rose to $122.5 million from $108.9
million, Dart disclosed Friday.
   For the full fiscal year, Dart posted a loss of $19.7 million,
compared with a profit of $30.7 million, or $16.43 per share, in
the previous year. Annual revenue rose to $406.8 million from
$367.4 million.
   The annual loss stemmed mainly from the $67.1 million loss the
company suffered in its aborted attempted takeover of Dayton Hudson
Corp. After accumulating stock in the Minneapolis-based retailer,
the Hafts were forced to sell the shares at a loss during the
October stock market crash.
   Dart controls operations of the Crown Books and Trak Auto retail
chains.

   An upcoming report by Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop will declare that nicotine is an addictive drug, the
head of the federal Office of Smoking and Health said Sunday.
   Dr. Ronald M. Davis said he hopes the report will spur the
public to understand that cigarette smoking ``is more than just a
simple habit.''
   ``We have to at least give it the serious attention that we do
for the illicit drugs such as heroin, cocaine, etc.,'' Davis said
on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   Government officials have been saying for years that nicotine is
an addictive drug ``just like cocaine, just like heroin and other
drugs that people commonly accept as addicting,'' he said.
   ``But this report, which will be released in a few weeks, looks
at the evidence in far greater detail than we've ever looked at
before. It compares this drug nicotine versus other drugs,'' he
said.
   The report would be the first by a federal official with as high
a rank as the surgeon general to declare nicotine addictive.
   Davis noted that the 1986 surgeon general's report on smoking,
which documented the health hazards of passive smoking, accelerated
the trend toward restricting or banning smoking in public places
and in the work place. Among the changes triggered by that report
is the recently inaugurated ban on smoking on commercial airplane
flights that last two hours or less.
   Although Davis did not say exactly what steps should be taken
once the surgeon general issues his report, he questioned some
current ways that cigarettes are distributed.
   ``Why ... do we sell tobacco products in vending machines?'' he
asked. ``We don't allow other addicting drugs to be sold in vending
machines. Why do we allow free samples of the product to be sent
through the mail? Or to be passed out on public property where kids
and others have free access to them? When we call this drug an
addicting drug, we have to take it more seriously than we currently
do.''
   Attempts to reach tobacco industry officials for comment on the
upcoming Koop report were unsuccessful. A spokeswoman for the
Tobacco Institute and a spokesman for the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
did not answer phone calls made to numbers listed for their homes
on Sunday afternoon.
   Davis attributed the lack of federal regulations on cigarettes
to the historical social acceptability of smoking ``and probably
the political influence of the tobacco industry.''
   But Davis said he believes that as fewer people smoke, as it
becomes a less socially acceptable activity and as people become
more aware of the hazards of smoking, ``we'll begin to take actions
that we've taken long ago for most other consumer products.''
   He said lower tar, lower nicotine cigarettes are not the answer
because some people smoking such cigarettes ``actually start to
smoke more cigarettes per day, or inhale more deeply, or puff more
frequently.''
   Davis noted that overall, only 27 percent of the adult
population currently smokes cigarettes, compared with 42 percent of
adults in 1964 when the first surgeon general's report documenting
some health risks of smoking was released.
   But he said higher smoking rates are occurring in certain
population groups, specifically blue collar workers, the
unemployed, certain racial and ethnic minority groups and young
women.
   ``Young women smoke at a higher rate than young men, which is
the only age group at which we see women smoking more than men,''
he said, attributing that in part to advertising ploys indicating
that cigarette smoking is a form of women's liberation.

<HEAD>Beazer Says It Owns, Has Offers For Two-Thirds Of Koppers Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two-thirds of the outstanding common
shares of Koppers Co. are owned by or have been tendered to the
investment group pressing a $1.7 billion hostile takeover bid for
the company, the group has disclosed.
   The group headed by British industrialist Brian Beazer and the
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. disclosed Saturday it
had been tendered about 17.2 million Koppers common shares by
midnight Friday under its $60 a share hostile offer.
   Combined with the 2.1 million Koppers shares, the group already
owns, it now holds or has been tendered about 68.5 percent of
Koppers' outstanding common stock. It also has received tenders for
about 65 percent of Koppers' preferred shares.
   The Beazer group may not actually buy any of the tendered shares
yet because of two federal court injunctions blocking its tender
offer. The injunctions stemmed from court challenges to the buyout
over alleged antitrust problems and Koppers' complaint that
Shearson violated securities law in making the bid.
   The Beazer group has extended its offer through midnight May 6.
   Koppers has asked U.S. District Judge Maurice B. Cohill in
Pittsburgh to force the Beazer group to extend its offer until at
least May 13, when a federal court in San Francisco will hear an
appeal of a lower court ruling halting the bid on antitrust grounds.
   Cohill has not decided whether to schedule a full trial on
Koppers' charges that Shearson violated securities laws in the
offer, or alternatively to accept the investment firm's recent
disclosure statements that attempt to answer his objections.

<HEAD>Small Bankers, Depositors Say FDIC Playing Favorites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small bank depositors and officers say federal
regulators are slighting them by protecting uninsured deposits in
Texas' biggest banks but largely refusing to do the same for
smaller institutions.
   When First RepublicBank Corp. began having problems in March,
federal regulators guranteed all of its deposits _ including $7.6
billion worth of deposits that exceeded the $100,000 per account
limit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   But businessman Randy Smith, whose Cecil Carr Construction Co.
had $202,000 in Park West Bank of Plano when the bank failed in
August 1985, said the company had yet to recover $86,000 of the
deposits that exceeded the $100,000 cap.
   ``It's a horror story,'' Smith told the Dallas Times Herald.
``Everyone knew that the FDIC would bail out First Republic's
depositors, but Park West's uninsured depositors were left to have
their throats cut.''
   ``We were dealing with a widespread crisis of confidence at
First Republic,'' countered FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney, whose
agency pumped $1 billion into the troubled banker to help offset a
serious runoff of deposits. ``We had no choice.''
   Since the start of 1985, 2,980 accounts at 28 failed Texas banks
have not been fully covered by the FDIC. In those closings, $58
million in uninsured deposits have been placed at risk of not being
covered by the FDIC.
   The state's independent bankers say federal regulators are
discriminating against small bank depositors and small banks.
   They contend that regulators close small troubled banks while
giving multibillion-dollar bailouts to giants such as First
RepublicBank and First City Bancorporation of Texas.
   ``The federal regulators are our judges, jury and
executioners,'' says F. Hagen McMahon Jr., director of the
Independent Bankers Association of Texas, which represents about
1,400 independent Texas banks. ``They are not closing the large
banks, they are closing our banks.''
   William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, said the only solution
for failed small banks was to close them and either pay off insured
deposits or transfer the accounts to another institution and give
uninsured depositors a claim against recoveries made in liquidating
the failed banks' assets.
   The unworkable alternative, he said, would be to take over and
operate each of the 140 U.S. banks that failed since 1985 and
couldn't be sold.
   Regulators say that small-bank depositors aren't suffering as
much as Texas bankers contend. In the 109 Texas bank failures since
the beginning of 1985, about $11.2 billion in deposits either were
transferred to acquiring institutions or paid off 100 percent,
Whitney said.
   Of the $50 million in uninsured deposits in closed banks, the
FDIC expects ultimately to repay $34 million, giving uninsured
depositors a loss of $16 million, or 32 cents per uninsured dollar.
   ``Very few depositors lose money in small bank failures,''
Seidman said.
   But McMahon said the smaller bankers have suffered nevertheless,
while the FDIC pumped $50 million into Dallas-based BancTexas
Group, $1 billion into First City and $1 billion into First
RepublicBank.
   ``Let us point out that our bankers live in the same economy as
the bankers working for First Republic,'' McMahon said in an open
letter to Congress and regulators. ``We are exasperated with the
two-tier treatment that is dished out by the federal regulatory
bodies.''

<HEAD>Shiitake Mushroom Helps Environment, Makes Money For Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists here believe there is money
beyond wealth in shiitake mushrooms, a popular Japanese delicacy
that they have popping out of 700 neatly stacked logs at a secluded
Vermilion County research site.
   The large, expensive mushrooms _ pronounced SHEE-tah-keh _ could
help reduce soil erosion, improve forest management and create
wildlife habitat while serving as a cash crop for their growers,
scientists say.
   ``We're in this for the environmental aspects,'' said Kenneth
Konsis, the Kennekuk Cove Park forester who teaches shiitake
growing. ``The mushrooms are a financial incentive to get
landowners to do this.''
   Scientists say that adding trees to crop land to provide a
shiitake growth medium can help reduce soil erosion, and that
cutting smaller logs from trees can improve existing forests. In
either case, wildlife should benefit, they say.
   Domestic shiitake production also could take a small slice out
of the U.S. trade deficit, because the nation now imports about
$100 million worth of the mushrooms from Japan annually. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates domestic growers have a $2
million a year market now, and it eventually could be 10 times that
large.
   ``We're growing higher quality mushrooms than they are in
Japan,'' said Konsis. ``They are buying our best mushrooms and
shipping them back to Japan.''
   Shiitake mushrooms have been grown commercially in the United
States for less than 10 years, said Christopher Burnett of the
Illinois Natural History Survey. Growers produced nearly 3 million
pounds last year.
   This two-year-old, east-central Illinois research project
developed by Burnett, a wildlife ecologist, is designed to identify
the best shiitake varieties and the best type of logs for Illinois
production.
   It also is a workshop for people who want to learn how to raise
shiitake.
   ``My son and I are interested in things like that _ almost a
garden type project,'' said Larry Larimore of Urbana, who took the
class last winter. ``We don't expect to be big mushroom growers.''
   But Larimore said his son is a truck farmer and the shiitake
harvest from their 100 logs will allow him to diversify his produce
sales at farmers' markets and retail stores.
   The brownish shiitake caps can be large enough to fill the palm
of a man's hand, and have sold for $1 an ounce in local
supermarkets, he said.
   The shiitake is meatier, chewier and more flavorful than the
button mushrooms found in most stores, Burnett said.
   Konsis said the mushrooms are grown by placing spores in up to
90 holes drilled in logs, referably oak, of about three feet long
and four inches in diameter.
   The holes are sealed with wax and the logs are stacked for about
a year, occasionally rotated, and sometimes soaked in a small
lagoon to encourage the emergence of mushrooms, said Konsis.
   Burnett estimates it costs $1 plus labor to ready a log for
production, and the log will yield from three to nine pounds of
mushrooms over five or six years. The grower should be able to sell
the shiitake for about $6 a pound, he said.
   ``My strategy to convince people to do things to create
(wildlife) habitat is to convince them woodlands have some economic
value,'' said Burnett, who hopes similar demonstrations will be
done in other parts of Illinois. ``It's not difficult to do and the
market is growing.''
