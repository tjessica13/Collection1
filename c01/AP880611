<HEAD>Reagan Bans from US Those Panamanians Who Help Noriega's Regime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is barring from the United
States Panamanian government and military officials known to
support Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In a proclamation, the president Friday said Noriega and his
handpicked president, Manuel Solis Palma, ``are preventing the
legitimate government of President Eric Arturo Delvalle from
restoring order and democracy in that country.''
   ``I have determined that it is in the interests of the United
States to restrict the entrance into the United States as
immigrants and non-immigrants of certain persons who formulate or
implement the policies'' of Noriega and Solis Palma said Reagan.
   ``The proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in
effect until such time as the secretary of state determines that
democracy has been restored in Panama,'' the president said.
   The Reagan administration has tried unsuccessfully to get
Noriega, who is under indictment on drug trafficking charges in
Florida, to yield power to Delvalle in Panama.
   A U.S. official said the order might affect several hundred
Panamanians.
   The move prompted a quick denunciation and a threat of
retaliation by the Panamanian government.
   ``We could not care less about any lists made up by the Reagan
administration,'' said Boris Moreno, director of the Panamanian
National Information Service, in Panama City.
   ``The United States is free to make as many lists as it wants of
Panamanians it does not want to admit there, just as we can make
our lists of U.S. citizens we do not want in Panama.''
   Under the president's proclamation, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz will designate those Panamanian nationals who, with their
families, will be barred from entering the United States because of
their role in aiding Noriega's regime.
   Panamanians on the list who attempt to come to the United States
would be stopped at U.S. ports of entry or they would be denied
visas at U.S. consular offices, the official said.
   The president said the order would be enforce so as not conflict
with international obligations of the United States or prohibit the
entry of individuals into the United States to submit to U.S.
government legal proceedings.
   ``The purpose of the declaration is, in a very ungentle manner,
to let Noriega's supporters know that their continuing support for
him is not going to be without some personal cost,'' said a State
Department official, asking not to be identified.
   The last time such a restriction was imposed occurred in 1985
when most non-immigrant Cubans were prevented from entering the
United States.

<HEAD>`Aging Rabble-Rouser' Address Capital's Elite at Son's Graduation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mario Savio called himself ``not just an aging
rabble-rouser but a parent also'' as the pioneer of the student
movement of the 1960s spoke at his son's graduation from a
prestigious Washington high school.
   The one-time University of California at Berkeley firebrand who
helped trigger the student power movement also described his change
during college from being ``a most unpolitical son of unpolitical
Italian immigrants.''
   ``We came to view America as a racist and imperialist power ...
(that) covered its tracks with a beguiling opportunity for self
expression,'' the 45-year-old told the class at Sidwell Friends
School.
   ``It was always right now in the '60s _ Freedom Now, Peace
Now,'' he said. ``Did we not know that we could spoil the work by
the way we dashed it off? We lived our lives as if we might not
live to the ripe old age of 30. Even so ... we did not leave all
our eggs in one basket. We bore children.''
   Savio's son, 18-year-old Nadav Savio, who plans to attend
Wesleyan University in Connecticut, not Berkeley, told The
Washington Post for a story in Saturday's editions that he has not
become involved in political issues.
   ``Some of what happened (in the 1960s) was excessive,'' he said.
``There was random and rampant drug experimentation. ... Some
people went overboard in various ways, but there was a lot of good
feeling among people and between people and that's something that
should be resurrected.''
   Savio, who dropped out of Berkeley in the mid-1960s, finally
received his bachelor's degree in 1984 from San Francisco State
University. He is now a graduate student and part-time lecturer in
physics at San Francisco State.
   Nadav Savio lives in Washington with his mother, Suzanne
Goldberg, a psychologist who is married to Dr. Sidney Wolfe,
director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Ralph Nader
organization.
   Savio is married for a second time and lives with his wife and
their child in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Contra Leader Calls for Renewed US Arms Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader Nicaraguan resistance leader says
Contra forces could face annihilation at the hands of the
Sandinistas unless the United States resumes military aid to the
rebels.
   The Contra leader, Adolfo Calero, said Friday at a news
conference the aid was needed because of Sandinista threats to wipe
out the insurgents if the latest round of peace talks did not
produce a final settlement to the Nicaraguan war.
   Peace talks between the leftist Sandinista government and the
Contras collapsed in Managua Thursday although both sides said a
temporary truce would remain in effect.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was
``disappointed at the Sandinista rejection of the Nicaraguan
Resistance proposal to achieve democracy and an end to the war in
Nicaragua.''
   The Reagan administration blamed the Nicaraguan government for
the breakdown in talks, but said no decision had been made about
whether to ask Congress for more aid for the insurgents.
   ``I think that in view of the Sandinistas' actions here, their
unwillingness to negotiate in good faith, their unwillingness to
instill democratic reforms, you may well see a press for Contra aid
from members of the Congress and from people in Nicaragua and from
other sources, but at this point we have made no decisions,'' said
Fitzwater.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., urged the White House to
propose an aid package for the Contras that matches the amount of
military assistance he said the Soviet Union provided to the
Sandinista government during the first three months of this year.
He put the amount at $105 million.
   Calero, indicated he felt that was a reasonable amount. The
rebels have received no military aid since Feb. 29. The House
rejected President Reagan's last military aid request for the
Contras on Feb. 3.
   But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a leader of the anti-Contra
forces in the House said, ``This is no time to be talking of
military aid.'' He called for additional efforts to achieve a peace
settlement before a new military aid request is considered.
   The goal of the latest negotiating round, which began on
Tuesday, was to end the war and install democratic reforms, in
accordance with a preliminary peace plan signed on March 23 in
Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   The discussions had been described as the fourth and final round
of a series which have taken place under an interim truce.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, back in his home territory for the
weekend, says he hopes to help forge an economic alliance among
farmers and industrial workers.
   ``We want to bring people beyond racism, beyond sexism and
beyond anti-Semitism,'' said Jackson, in brief statements to
reporters late Friday as he arrived in Chicago from a campaign
swing in California.
   Jackson said he would unveil his new plans today in a speech at
the headquarters of Operation Push, the civil rights group he
founded.
   The candidate said his latest 40-day campaign plan would focus
on economic proposals.
   ``We'll focus on ways to protect workers, farmers, the aged and
the poor against the ravages of Reagonomics,'' he said.
   Jackson was asked about polls indicating he would hurt
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis as a running mate against the
Republican ticket headed by George Bush.
   ``If we are within four points of Bush before the race begins,
we have the capacity to win,'' Jackson replied.
   Jackson came in second place to Dukakis in delegate and popular
vote count in the Democratic primaries, but a survey published in
The Washington Post suggested he would hurt the ticket among groups
whose support the Democrats need to win in the fall.
   And another poll, conducted for USA Today and Cable News
Network, indicated a Dukakis-led ticket with Jesse Jackson as the
running mate would lose to George Bush, 47 percent to 40 percent.
Otherwise, Dukakis would win, 45 percent to 39 percent, the survey
suggested.
   Dukakis has said only that Jackson deserves to be considered,
not that he has any special claim on the job.
   Confusion over Jackson's position on the matter has been
heightened in recent days by a Cable News Network report that
quoted him as saying he wants to be vice president.
   ``Let's leave it at consideration,'' Jackson said Friday in
California when asked to clarify the matter.
   Jackson has said he deserves to be offered a spot on the ticket,
but the ABC News-Post survey found that two-thirds of Democratic
voters believe the nominee has the right to ``choose anyone he
wants'' as a running mate. Only three in 10 said the second spot on
the ticket should automatically go to the second-place finisher in
the primaries, the poll said.
   The ABC-Post poll said Jackson was the vice presidential choice
of 36 percent of all registered Democrats. However, nearly
one-quarter of those surveyed said they would be less likely to
vote for Dukakis if Jackson were on the ticket. Only 12 percent
said they would be more likely to vote Democratic with Jackson in
the No. 2 spot, the poll said.
   Earlier Friday, Jackson said in California that he has better
credentials than anyone else in politics to be the Democratic vice
presidential nominee.
   While others may be qualified, Jackson said, none has shown
ability to win 7 million votes as he did in the primary season or
has his combination of regional and political strengths to balance
a ticket headed by Dukakis.
   ``We meet virtually every stated qualification for serious
consideration on the ticket,'' he said. ``No one else at this point
that's active in politics has shown the breadth of support I have
shown at the voting polls; no one else has shown the ability to
impact on the country's tone and the party's priorities.
   ``They may have state credentials. They've not shown themselves
to have national vote-getting potential,'' Jackson told reporters
who accompanied him to a two-day working vacation at the posh La
Costa health spa north of San Diego.
   Jackson left La Costa Friday afternoon to head to return to
Chicago, where he planned to meet with civil rights leaders and
continue plans for the convention.
   Although visibly tired and talking very softly after his long
flight, Jackson brought a touch of California casualness to the
chilly Chicago night.
   The often soberly dressed candidate was wearing blue jeans,
leather sandals and a black jacket bearing the emblem of the
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. He also wore
a silver pin in the form of a stevedore's pick _ a symbol of the
union.

   Here, at a glance, are the possible violations
of House rules by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, which the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said it would
investigate:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NEPTUNE OIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _``Lobbying efforts on behalf of a constituent with whom he had
an interest in a private gas well venture.''
   This allegation refers to Wright's actions in 1979 on behalf of
Neptune Oil, owned in part by Richard Moncrief. The speaker wrote
to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat a letter on behalf of the
company, whose assets were at issue during the Camp David accords.
The speaker says his financial relationship with the Moncrief
family was unrelated to Neptune and he had no personal financial
stake in the outcome.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TEXAS OIL & GAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _``Circumstances surrounding intervention in a matter before the
Department of the Interior on behalf of Texas Oil & Gas Co.''
   The speaker says published allegations that he owned stock in
the company were incorrect, and he had no financial interest in the
outcome of the federal decision on an Arkansas energy exploration.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BOOK ROYALTIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _``Whether campaign funds were used, directly or indirectly, to
pay for publication of a book from which he received a 55 percent
royalty.''
   The speaker earned about $55,000, based on the generous royalty
arrangement on a book published by his friend, businessman William
Carlos Moore. The company owned by Moore has done nearly $300,000
in work for Wright's campaign. The speaker denies the favorable
book contract was a way of repaying him for that business, or in
any way a recycling of his campaign money for personal use.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PERSONAL USE OF STAFF</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _``Whether government resources were improperly used to complete
work on a book from which he received royalties.''
   This refers to the same book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.'' A
member of Wright's staff heled compile the paperback collection of
the speaker's remarks and writings and Wright's office used $2,000
in public money to send the aide to Fort Worth to work on the
project. The speaker says the book work was in addition to the
staff member giving the public full value for its money.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FORT WORTH CONDOMINIUM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _``The use of a condominium in Fort Worth, Texas.''
   Wright was given full use of a poolside condominium for his
congressional district residence by the family of business partner
George Mallick. The speaker paid no monthly rent, but he paid
expenses and a per diem when he used it. Wright says the owner has
no interest in legislation, the per diem of $21.67 was at market
rate, and the unit would have otherwise remained vacant. Wright
said he recently bought the condominium for $58,500.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TEXAS SAVINGS & LOANS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _``The possible exercise of undue influence in dealing with
officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.''
   The speaker allegedly sought special treatment from the chairman
of the bank board for Texas savings and loans officials, including
Democratic campaign contributors. Wright insists he was only asking
for fair hearings for his constituents.

<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   JESSE JACKSON, saying he has the best credentials of anyone in
politics to be the vice presidential nominee: ``We meet virtually
every stated qualification for serious consideration on the ticket.
No one else at this point that's active in politics has shown the
breadth of support I have shown at the voting polls; no one else
has shown the ability to impact on the country's tone and the
party's priorities.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, asked whether he plans to respond to George
Bush's attacks that he's an elitist by bringing up Bush's own
background, which includes Yale University: ``I really am not
interested. I don't think the American people are interested. I
think that's a losing strategy.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, saying he finds it curious that Dukakis has accused
him of dirty politics after he attacked Dukakis' domestic and
foreign policies: ``You're looking at a guy who's been getting hit
for six months, guilt by association, and all kinds of personal
attacks. What happens now, they raise the mudslinging thing. This
is going to be a fun campaign.''
   
   REP. WILLIAM GRAY III of Pennsylvania, drafting committee
chairman, hoping to craft a party platform that suits both Dukakis
and Jackson: ``As we go through the discussion of issues _ drugs,
education, civil rights, health care ... hopefully they'll realize
that their differences are not that great and begin to come to a
consensus of their own.''
   
   PAUL KIRK, Democratic Party chief, pushing his dream of a short
and readable platform: ``I don't think we'll end up with the Yellow
Pages, an ad for every organized group.''

<HEAD>Israel Allows Norwegian Inspection Of Heavy Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel and Norway have agreed that Norwegian
experts can inspect a shipment of Norwegian heavy water, a chemical
used in the production of nuclear weapons.
   Foreign Trade Minister Kurt Mosbakk told Parliament on Friday
that an agreement on the inspection was negotiated by Israel and
Norway in Oslo earlier this week, the national news agency NTB
reported.
   The news agency said Mosbakk told parliament that about half of
the 20 tons of heavy water sold to Israel in 1959 had vanished
through waste and evaporation.
   Norwegian experts would be allowed to inspect the remaining
half, NTB said.
   When Norway sold Israel the water almost 30 years ago the
contract stipulated that Norway had the right to inspect the water
and that it could be used for peaceful purposes only.
   Norway did not raise the question of inspection until Israeli
nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu told a British newspaper that
Israel had used heavy water to produce plutonium for use in nuclear
weapons. Vanunu is serving an 18-year prison term in Israel for
treason.
   In three previous rounds of negotiations about the inspection
issue, Israel rejected a Norwegian proposal to transfer its
inspection right to the Vienna-based International Atom Energy
Agency.
   Since Norway started production of heavy water in the late
1930s, about 450 tons have been exported, mostly for scientific
research. Ten countries, including Israel, received amounts large
enough for use in nuclear reactors.
   Two nuclear powers, France and Britain, received heavy water
from Norway on the condition that they did no re-export it. Seven
other import countries have signed the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty, which allows on-site inspection. Israel has not signed the
treaty.

<TEXT>
   Panama shrugged off Washington's move
to ban from the United States Panamanian officials supporting Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega and warned that Panama could bar U.S.
officials also.
   The ban, announced Friday in Washington, was the latest in a
series of steps the United States has taken in recent months to
show displeasure with Panama's leader.
   President Reagan's order bars from the United States top
Panamanian government and military officials known to back Noriega,
the country's military commander and the power behind its civilian
government.
   A State Department official said the order would probably affect
several hundred Panamanians.
   Boris Moreno, director of Panama's National Information Service,
responded to the order Friday by saying, ``We could not care less
about any lists made up by the Reagan administration.
   ``The United States is free to make as many lists as it wants of
Panamanians it does not want to admit there, just as we can make
our lists of U.S. citizens we do not want in Panama,'' he said.
   The Reagan administration has imposed sweeping economic
sanctions against Panama in an effort to force the ouster of
Noriega, who was indicted in February by a federal grand jury in
Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   Romulo Escobar Bethancourt, president of the pro-government
Democratic Revolutionary Party, said Friday that the United States
scuttled an offer by Colombia to provide $70 million in aid to help
Panama through the financial crunch caused by the sanctions.
   He said the Panamanian government first negotiated with Japan
and Taiwan and when those discussions broke down, it turned to
Colombia, which agreed to provide the money if it would be returned
when U.S.-Panamanian relations improved.
   ``Then the U.S. insulted Colombia and blocked the negotiations
by saying the Colombian money came from drug trafficking,'' Escobar
Bethancourt said.
   About $50 million in Panamanian government assets has been
frozen in U.S. banks. Panama uses the U.S. dollar as its currency.
   In announcing the ban on Panamanian government officials, Reagan
said Noriega and his hand-picked president, Manuel Solis Palma,
``are preventing the legitimate government of President Eric Arturo
Delvalle from restoring order and democracy in that country.''
   Delvalle was deposed by the National Assembly in February the
day after he tried to fire Noriega.
   After he was ousted, his family took refuge in the U.S.
ambassador's residence, and Delvalle apparently spends much time
there. He often meets there with English-speaking journalists, who
are asked not to disclose the location.
   At other times, according to sources speaking on condition of
anonymity, Delvalle stays in safe homes provided by the U.S.
government at its military installations in Panama.
   ``If they want him (Delvalle) to re-establish democracy, as they
say, let him come out of his little Pentagon in the U.S. bases
here,'' Moreno said.

   South Korea's automotive industry,
gripped by prolonged labor disputes, has lost more than $1.5
billion in production and exports, the Trade and Industry Ministry
reported today.
   The ministry said lost production of parts and automobiles was
estimated at $1.32 billion since January. Car export goals for the
period were down by 37,330 vehicles, worth $219 million.
   Ministry officials said they feared Korean auto exports may fall
far short of a year-end goal of 756,000 vehicles if the labor
problems continued.
   Hyundai Motor Co., the country's largest automaker, has been
struck since May 30 with its assemly plant in Ulsan on the east
coast shut down completely. Strikers are demanding higher pay and
better conditions.
   Hyundai officials said there was no immediate indication when
suspended union-management wage talks would resume. They said both
parties remained far apart on the extent of wage hikes.
   The union demanded an increase of 48 percent or about $180 a
month, while the management offered a 25 percent raise or about
$100.
   Daewoo Motor Co., the second biggest automaker, was hit by
strikes at its main plant near Seoul in April. The automaker is a
joint venture between Korean interests and General Motors Corp. of
the United States.
   Operations at the plants of Kia Motors Corp., partly owned by
Ford Motor Co., and two other smaller companies were also reported
suffering from prolonged wage disputes or a lack of key parts
caused by strikes at parts suppliers.
   Production operations have been suspended or reduced at about
500 parts makers for many weeks due to labor strikes, sabotage or
other problems, with 600 other companies in normal operation.
   Some of the affected parts makers have asked for emergency
bailout loans saying they face bankruptcy, but monetary authorities
were reportedly reluctant to comply with the requests citing the
government's tight money policy to counter feared inflation.
   Last year, South Korea produced one million cars and commercial
vehicles and exported 540,000 of them.

   Officials from the Tokyo prosecutor's office on Friday arrested
Shigeru Suzuki, 59, a former councilor in charge of government
public relations, for accepting bribes in return for extending
favors, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Also arrested were two men who allegedly offered the bribes to
Suzuki: Saburo Toyama, 67, chairman of an Osaka-based advertising
company, and Tsutomu Nishida, 56, head of its Tokyo branch.
   The Asahi Shimbun, a nationally circulated daily, reported today
that investigators found the two had entertained Suzuki with
dinners in Tokyo and golf outings costing a total of $7,200.
   The entertainment led to increased orders for television
advertisements, the report said.
   The prosecutor's office refused to confirm or deny the report.
   Another former Prime Minister's Office official was arrested in
May for allegedly accepting about $18,400 in bribes from
advertising agents.

   A labor leader today denied asking
AFL-CIO officials to press Washington to drop preferential tariffs
to protest the government's alleged human rights violations.
   Vethamuthu David, head of the Malaysian Trade Unions Congress,
said his union is ``fully convinced that labor and human rights
problems in our country can be solved within the Malaysian
context.''
   Government officials attacked David, who also belongs to an
opposition party, after reports last week that he had asked AFL-CIO
officials for help. They said his reported requests to the AFL-CIO
could hurt the Southeast Asian nation's economy.
   David was arrested and held without trial in October under the
Internal Security Act for allegedly fanning racial tensions. He was
released June 3.
   The government has used the act to arrest more than 100 people,
including opposition leaders, in the past year.

<TEXT>
   A jury will be asked to decide next week
whether Evan Mecham and his brother committed a crime when they
failed to itemize a $350,000 campaign loan _ a case the former
governor insists is based on ``smoke and mirrors.''
   The defense rested Friday in the trial of Mecham and his
brother, Willard, without calling either defendant to the stand
during the seven days of testimony. The Maricopa County Superior
Court jury is to hear final arguments on Tuesday before starting
deliberations.
   ``I'm confident that the state has not proved its case,''
Mecham, 64, told reporters as he left the courtroom Friday.
   The former governor stopped short of predicting acquittal but
said, ``I think the smoke and mirrors that this whole thing has
been created by ... has been totally revealed to the world.''
   However, co-prosecutor Michael Cudahy said, ``I think the state
position is even stronger after the witnesses called by the
defense.''
   Judge Michael Ryan denied the Mechams' requests for a directed
verdict, in which the judge would render a verdict without the case
going to the jury.
   Evan and Willard Mecham, who was his brother's 1986 campaign
treasurer, are charged with concealing the $350,000 campaign loan
on financial reports required by the state.
   The defense contended the loan was properly reported as part of
a $465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from Mecham. The
defense also said the failure to itemize the loan was an innocent
mistake.
   But the prosecution maintained the Mecham campaign badly needed
the $350,000 loan and feared disclosing that it came from developer
Barry Wolfson because Mecham's campaign theme was one of being
``beholden to no one.''
   The Wolfson loan was not itemized on either Mecham's campaign or
personal financial disclosure forms.
   During Friday's testimony, Cudahy sought to establish that Evan
Mecham was personally responsible for the failure to report the
loan because he reported his finances as a candidate rather than a
committee.
   Anyone who looked at Mecham's financial reports would not know
Mecham borrowed $350,000 from Wolfson, Cudahy contended while
questioning Secretary of State Jim Shumway, whose office is
responsible for accepting such reports.
   ``Does the name Barry Wolfson appear anywhere on the
post-general contribution and expenditure report filed by Evan
Mecham at your office?'' Cudahy asked Shumway, a defense witness.
   ``I don't see any contributor by that name,'' Shumway answered.
   Mecham is on trial on six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in
prison if convicted on all counts. His brother is charged with
three similar counts and faces up to 9{ years in prison if
convicted.
   Mecham, a Republican, took office in January 1987. He was
removed from office April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of
two unrelated impeachment counts.

   Helen Joseph, one of the first
white South Africans ever banned by the government for
anti-apartheid activities, is in serious condition at a hospital.
   Mrs. Joseph, 83, had been reported ``critical and sinking fast''
by a family friend Thursday. The Johannesburg General Hospital said
Friday she was in serious condition, but the family had asked that
no further details be released.
   For the past three decades it has been illegal to quote Mrs.
Joseph in South Africa.
   In 1957, Mrs. Joseph received the first of several banning
orders, which for 16 of the next 25 years prohibited her from
leaving Johannesburg, attending political meetings, writing for
publication and communicating with other banned people.
   In 1962, she became the first South African placed under house
arrest, which required her to stay in her cottage north of
Johannesburg from dawn to dusk, report to police daily and visit
with no more than one person at a time.
   Born in England in 1905, Helen Fennell came to South Africa from
India in 1931, and, as a social worker, began participating in
anti-apartheid campaigns at the age of 48.
   She helped found the Federation of South African Women, which in
1956 staged one of the biggest protests in the country's history _
a march by 20,000 black women on the government buildings in
Pretoria.

   Necessity may be the mother of
invention but the possiblity of making a million dollars seems to
help.
   An attorney who helped organize the 31st annual Minnesota
Inventors Congress says some gadget makers come with dollar signs
in their eyes.
   ``Some are quite naive,'' said William Braddock, a Minneapolis
patent attorney. ``They will come and say `I've got this invention.
It works. Where do I go to get my million dollars?' It's often that
simplistic. We try to put them on the right road.''
   David Ludvigson, of Sioux Falls, S.D., said a harrowing
experience led to his invention.
   ``I was almost killed off by a kid on a skateboard one night, so
I went home and invented the `thrasher flasher,''' said Ludvigson,
a camera repairman and participant in the three-day Inventors
Congress, which began Friday.
   His thrasher flasher is essentially a headlight for a
skateboard. It's a low-intensity strobe light attached to the
board's wheel axle.
   Like many of the 88 exhibitors and 108 inventors at the
congress, Ludvigson is hoping someone will spot the flasher and
decide to market it.
   People come to the congress, which has been held annually in
Redwood Falls since 1958, not only to get exposure and to market
their ideas, but also to find direction.
   Others come to get the public's reaction to their inventions,
said Andrew Amoroso, a business development specialist from the
U.S. Small Business Administration.
   ``They want to know, `Is there any market for my products? I
have shown it to my family, and they all think it is a good idea,
but what about John Q. Public? What is he going to think about
it?''' Amoroso said.
   Some people, such as brothers Darrell, Vernon and Richard Fox of
Langdon, N.D., are compulsive inventors and design products after
seeing a need for it.
   They invented an aluminum can crusher, an electrical contraption
that hangs on the rim of garbage cans and crushes cans.
   ``We saw that whole cans were really causing space problems,''
Darrell Fox said.

to make it a felony to strip mine coal without a permit.
   Legislation proposed Friday by the Office of Surface Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement which calls for a maximum prison term

wildcatters.
   `The civil procedures are so ponderous, it's difficult to keep

   Strip mining without a permit is now a civil offense with a top
penalty of $22,500, but the bill also would allow a judge to impose
a fine of up to $250,000 against a convicted individual and a fine
of up to $500,000 against a convicted organization.

<HEAD>UNESCO Plays Down Controversial Communications Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UNESCO officials have backed away from a proposal
to create a global communications order that some Western nations
viewed as a threat to the freedom of the press.
   The U.S. observer to UNESCO cautiously praised the
recommendations, released by the group's executive board Friday.
   The new communications strategy played down establishing a new
world information and communication order. The concept lay at the
heart of a decade-old debate at the 158-nation U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization and helped convince the United
States and Britain to withdraw.
   The board's recommendations go to UNESCO Director General
Federico Mayor, who is trying to persuade those two nations to
rejoin.
   The report's communications section admitted that journalists
had widely interpreted UNESCO's efforts to establish a new world
order as aimed at ``undermining freedom of information.''
   ``This resulted in a misunderstanding that was used to sully the
organization's image,'' it said.
   The section said UNESCO should ``explore the possibilities of a
new strategy ... that will dispel the misunderstanding.''
   It said the strategy should emphasize ``development of critical
acumen among (media) users, the ability for individuals and
communities to react to any kind of manipulation (by the media) and
to become familiair with the means available to users to defend
their right of reply.''
   The section also said UNESCO should seek to ``ensure a free and
wider and more balanced flow of information.''
   In the past, Western governments and media groups have tried to
replace the words ``more balanced'' with ``unrestricted.''
   These governments and Western media groups expressed concern
that the proposed new world communications order could lead to
codes of conduct and licensing of journalists.
   U.S. observer Richard T. Miller said the latest recommendations,
approved by consensus without a vote, contained ``scope for
positive change.''
   ``However, I am distressed at the tone'' in the communications
section, which ``tries to set up an adversary relationship between
the media and its audience.''
   The board's recommendations, presented at the end of its spring
meeting, are intended to guide Mayor in preparation of UNESCO's
plan of activities for the l990s.
   At the board's opening meeting three weeks ago, Mayor, a Spanish
scientist who took office in November, proposed that UNESCO's 14
major programs be reduced to five. He suggested that the
organization should do fewer things but do them better and with
more follow-up.
   The board has recommended cutting programs to seven. It added
one dealing with peace, human rights and elimination of
discrimination, and another that covers development studies.
   A group of 77 Third World countries and the Soviet bloc
criticized Mayor for dropping these programs from his plan for the
1990s.
   Along with communications, the peace and human rights proposals
have provoked controversial debates in the past.
   Mayor will use the document prepared by the board to draft an
outline of the plan for the 1990s for the fall meeting of the board.

   The pro-Vietnamese government in Phnom
Penh will release an American who was captured 13 months ago after
illegaly crossing into Cambodia, the official Cambodian news agency
SPK said today.
   The agency said Sterling Brian Bono, 35, was seized on May 2,
1987 after he crossed the Thai border into the western Cambodian
province of Battambang.
   SPK did not say when Bono, of Las Animas, Colo., would leave
Cambodia.
   Some reports have said that Bono, a Vietnam war army veteran,
crossed into Cambodia to look for some 80 Americans still listed as
missing in action from the Indochina conflict. But others said Bono
hoped to locate and help Vietnamese he had known during the war who
he thought might have fled to the Thai-Cambodian border area.
   U.S. officials were aware of Bono's capture and said they were
working on his case through the International Red Cross. Washington
does not recognize the Phnom Penh government which was set up
following the late 1978 invasion of Cambodia by Vietnamese forces.
   Phnom Penh's Prime Minister, Hun Sen, spoke about Bono to
several Western correspondents visiting Phnom Penh last year.
   Phnom Penh is also known to be holding a number of Thais
captured along the frontier where Vietnamese and Phnom Penh troops
have been fighting Cambodian guerrillas since 1979.

   The body of a gemologist who disappeared while
carrying more than $500,000 worth of diamonds was tossed into the
Hudson River after she was bludgeoned to death, officials said.
   Barbara Mangiameli, 33, a free-lance gemologist, was last seen
at her Manhattan apartment building on Feb. 4, when she had an
appointment to return six diamonds after a proposed sale fell
through.
   Her naked body, bound in the fetal position around the neck,
wrists and ankles, was found Thursday floating in the river near
the lower end of Manhattan, police said. Her body was covered by
plastic bags, police said.
   An autopsy Friday determined she died from multiple blunt force
injuries to the scalp and face that caused skull fractures, brain
contusions and brain hemorrhaging, said Ellen Borakove, a
spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office.
   ``She wasn't in the water for very long,'' Ms. Borakove said.
``She was not dead for a very long period of time from the time
they found her (Thursday). It certainly is not months. Whether its
weeks or days, I cannot pin it down.''
   She was identified through dental records, Ms. Borakove said.
   Two brothers who were friends of Ms. Mangiameli's were arrested
in the case April 11 and have been in custody without bail since,
police said.
   Raoul Rivalta, 48, and his brother Fausto, 33, allegedly
arranged a meeting between Ms. Mangiameli and a potential buyer
that never took place.
   Ms. Mangiameli called the diamonds' owner on Feb. 3 to say she
would return the six diamonds worth between $500,000 and $600,000
the next day.
   A resident of her apartment building saw her in the building's
vestibule the afternoon of Feb. 4, relatives said. She was not seen
after that.
   According to the complaint, Fausto Rivalta sold a pear-shaped
diamond that was among those Ms. Mangiameli had in her possession
to a West Palm Beach, Fla. pawnshop for $14,000 on Feb. 17.

Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's increasingly open press
has reported that federal authorities were worried about a popular
uprising if they seized control in Slovenia, the nation's most
liberal republic.
   The ruling Communist Party, meanwhile, called for radical
economic changes on Friday, including freer, profit-oriented
markets and more foreign investment to overcome Yugoslavia's
deepening economic crisis.
   Reports have circulated for several weeks that military
authorities in Slovenia were thinking about stepping in to quell
liberal tendencies in the northernmost of Yugoslavia's six
republics.
   Federal officials and Communist leaders in the republic have
denied any plans for such an action.
   But NIN magazine on Friday published what it said were excerpts
of a transcript of a discussion of the police role after such a
takeover. A police official, whom the magazine did not identify,
was quoted as speaking of police ability ``to control the situation
after the arrests, since it is believed that the people will come
out into the streets.''
   NIN also quoted Igor Bavcar, a spokesman for a group formed to
fight the arrests of two journalists who first wrote of the alleged
takeover, as saying the transcript means ``nobody believes that the
stories about the coup have been fabricated.''
   Authorities have denied any link between the journalists report
on the takeover and their arrests last week by military authorities.
   Police have said the journalists were arrested along with a
soldier after an unmarked document on combat readiness was found in
their possession.
   Bavcar said his group would decide this weekend whether or not
to call for a 15-minute general strike next Tuesday in protest at
the arrests.
   The Slovenian daily Delo reported from Ljubljana that more than
7,000 people have signed a petition calling for the release of the
trio.
   Money is pouring into a special account to help the families of
those held, and more than 200 companies, Communist party cells and
trade union groups have backed the petition for release, Delo said.
   Slovenia's official lawyers' union issued a statement saying
public unease over the case should be seen as popular concern over
preserving gains of democratization.
   ``State organs cannot any longer demand in advance uncritical
trust from the people,'' the lawyers said, calling for strict
adherence to the law in the handling of the controversial case.
   The party's 52-page blueprint for economic change, largely
adopted at a party conference last month, advocated ``the
strengthening of market mechanisms'' and recomended measures to
attract ``the investment of more foreign capital'' in the Yugoslav
economy.
   It said the party supported ``investment of private funds'' in
small businesses as a means of ``restructuring the economy and
overcoming high unemployment.''
   ``The theses call for sweeping economic reforms to ensure the
autonomy of enterprises, the full affirmation of all elements of
the market and of economic laws, a single home market and an
opening to the world,'' the document said.
   Yugoslavia suffers from 150 percent inflation, a $21 billion
debt, worker unrest and heavily endebted firms.
   The government recently undertook a strict austerity program
curbing wages and spending as part of sweeping changes to be
completed before the end of the year.
   One of the party's most radical proposals is to base the
economy, for the first time, on the profit motive, ending the
practice of subsidizing and, when necessary, rescuing money-losing
enterprises.
   The party blueprint also contained a reference to human rights,
widely seen as a victory for a liberal faction in the party.

   A man whose doctoral dissertation was rejected by
a faculty committee in 1942 but hailed by historians four decades
later as a pioneering work has received his Ph.D.
   ``Celebrity is a new status and it's hard to get used to,''
Frank Bourgin, who gained national attention earlier this year when
his dissertation was finally accepted, said Friday.
   ``But if all this hoopla wasn't going on, I think I'd be feeling
quite depressed,'' said the 77-year-old retired civil servant, who
lives in Chevy Chase, Md. ``My polio is acting up, my walking
ability is reduced and I'm having difficulty getting out of a chair.
   ``But this attention, the commencement,'' he added, ``is such
great compensation.''
   Bourgin was a graduate student at Chicago and a disciple of the
late Professor Charles Merriam, the leading political scientist of
the day and a member of then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
circle of advisers known as the ``Brain Trust.''
   Under Merriam's guidance, Bourgin re-examined the history of
government planning in the United States. He then argued in his
dissertation that the country's early leaders, Alexander Hamilton
and Thomas Jefferson among them, had intended to use the powers of
the federal government to develop the fledgling nation's resources
through public works and other projects.
   The paper challenged the then-common conviction that Roosevelt's
New Deal social programs marked a departure from laissez-faire
principles attributed to the founding fathers.
   By the time his paper was rejected as not yet ``in satisfactory
shape,'' Bourgin was married with a child to support. He said he
couldn't afford to return to campus as a full-time student to
revise his manuscript, so he locked it away in a box.
   In the intervening years, he manufactured light fixtures, owned
a chain of men's clothing stores in Minnesota and became a federal
civil servant, eventually rising to become regional director for
the federal Office of Emergency Planning, supervising a five-state
region in the Midwest.
   ``But I never changed my mind on the essential idea I'd
developed in my paper,'' he recalled. ``I maintained my interest in
history, I looked everywhere, and whenever I read, I was constantly
looking to see if someone else had it.
   ``I was so convinced I was right, and so convinced of the
importance of it that tenacity was the easy part,'' he said.
   Bourgin's reward came last year, when he read historian Arthur
Schlesinger Jr.'s ``Cycles of American History,'' a chapter of
which made essentially the same argument Bourgin's paper had
offered nearly a half-century earlier.
   He wrote to Schlesinger, who looked at the dissertation and
wrote back: ``Congratulations on your path-breaking work ... I am
astonished by the fate of your thesis at Chicago.''
   Emboldened, Bourgin set in process a motion that culminated
Friday with Bourgin receiving his doctorate.
   ``I'm not sure how the paper was rejected the first time, but my
best guess is that after professor Merriam retired, my dissertation
became a kind of orphan.
   ``Also, I was already working at making a living while it was
being considered and I think the chairman of the department at the
time may not have wanted the degree cheapened by giving it to
someone who wouldn't use it,'' Bourgin said.
   ``I don't know if all that makes it any sweeter,'' he said.
``But it certainly has made the last few months of my life an
interesting time.''

<HEAD>Vatican Officials Meet Underground Church Leaders</HEAD>

   A 90-minute meeting with two high-level Vatican
officials gave the underground Ukrainian Catholic Church ``much
hope and strength,'' one of its lay leaders said.
   Also Friday, the 1,000th anniversary of Russian Christendom was
marked with a gala at the Bolshoi Theater attended by Raisa
Gorbachev, wife of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. American
evangelist Billy Graham and Rabbi Arthur Schneier, head of the
Appeal of Conscience Foundation of New York, were among the
speakers.
   The meeting and the appearance of the Soviet leader's wife at a
religious event underscored the changing attitude of the Communist
Party, which is officially atheist.
   The meeting of Vatican and Ukrainian clergymen at a Moscow
hotel, the first official one since Soviet leader Josef Stalin
crushed the church more than 40 years ago, was kept quiet by both
sides.
   ``The meeting was very warm and fruitful. It gave us much hope
and strength,'' said Ivan Gel, a lay leader of the Ukrainian
Catholic Church who accompanied the church delegation to the hotel.
   Members of the delegation said two bishops and three priests of
the Ukrainian Catholic Church met at the hotel with two cardinals
from the Vatican: Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli and Johannes
Willebrands, head of the Secretariat for Christian Unity.
   Gel said previous contacts were informal, at lower levels, and
Friday's meeting would not have been possible without the reforms
Gorbachev is making in Soviet society.
   It lasted 90 minutes, three times longer than scheduled, Gel
said.
   Vatican officials would not talk about the meeting. Members of
the Ukrainian delegation canceled a news conference, saying they
had promised not to discuss it further and were returning to the
Ukraine later Friday.
   No information was available about whether Pope John Paul II
addressed the issue of Ukrainian Catholics in a letter to Gorbachev
brought by Casaroli, the No. 2 Vatican official.
   Religious groups must be registered with the government, which
puts strict limits on the practice of religion. Officials have not
recognized Ukrainian Catholic groups, making their religious
services illegal.
   Officials say the Ukrainian Catholic Church numbers 4-5 million
believers, primarily in the western Ukraine. It was forcibly
assimilated into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946 when Stalin
consolidated his control over lands captured at the end of World
War II.
   Gel said 11 bishops were imprisoned under Stalin and only three
survived to carry on the consecration of other bishops and priests.
   Bishops Safron Kurchaba and Pavlo Vasilik led the Ukrainian
Church delegation to the meeting Friday, said Gel, who did not
attend although he accompanied the group to the Sovietskaya Hotel.
   The Russian Orthodox Church opposes recognition of the Ukrainian
church but has said it will discuss the issue with Vatican
representatives in Finland later this month.
   Others at the Bolshoi said Mrs. Gorbachev, dressed in a gray
suit and red blouse, sat in the front row of about 80 church and
government dignitaries.
   Schneier said Mrs. Gorbachev blushed when he turned from the
audience, faced her and said, alluding to the biblical story of
creation:
   ``You have been a trusted and devoted helpmate to your husband.
Your presence here is more than symbolic. It shows that as his
helpmate you are in sympathy with his cause and in support of his
pronouncements on the rights of believers.''
   Graham said he was ``encouraged by reports that there is a new
readiness on the part of both churches and the state to face the
mistakes of the past, and to seek together to find new ways of
expanding the religious rights and opportunities of believers and
religious groups within the framework of your socialist society,''
according to a text of his remarks.
   Patriarch Pimen, head of the Russian Orthodox church, called
Gorbachev a ``tireless architect of perestroika and a herald of new
political thinking,'' the official news agency Tass reported.

   The pieces are coming together and
officials here are confident they soon will launch their first
space shuttle mission since Challenger exploded nearly 2{ years ago.
   Two 126-foot-tall solid fuel booster rockets were hooked up
Friday with a huge external fuel tank, and on Thursday the stack
will be joined with the shuttle Discovery.
   The projected liftoff date is Aug. 31. But NASA officials
caution the schedule is tight, with many milestones to be passed.
   ``The August target is optimistic, for sure, but given where we
are today, we've got a shot at it,'' launch director Bob Sieck said.
   ``We're getting close and there's a feeling of excitement
here,'' said astronaut Bob Crippen, who as deputy director of
shuttle operations will make the decision in the closing minutes
whether Discovery should be launched.
   Crippen, a veteran of four space shuttle flights, and Sieck
spoke at a news conference.
   When Discovery reaches the launch pad, workers will prepare it
for a critical flight readiness firing of its three main liquid
fuel engines.
   The 20-second ignition, with Discovery bolted firmly to the pad,
will test several modifications made to the powerful engines during
the long period the shuttles have been grounded.
   It also will provide countdown experience for the launch team.
   Also ahead, on Tuesday and on July 26, are two more full-scale
firings of test models of the solid fuel booster rockets at the
Morton Thiokol facility in Utah. A faulty booster joint was blamed
for the explosion of Challenger and loss of its seven crew members
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Testing of the redesigned booster has gone so well that NASA was
able to confidently assemble here the two rockets for Discovery's
flight.
   Assigned to fly Discovery on the mission will be Frederick H.
Hauck, the commander; Richard O. Covey, the pilot; and mission
specialists George Nelson, Michael Lounge and David Hilmers.
   They are to deploy a communications satellite and conduct 11
science and technology experiments.

<TEXT>
   Union leaders criticized the Suffolk
County executive for his veto of a bill that would have made the
county the nation's first major municipality to regulate video
display terminals.
   ``I'm outraged at the county executive's submissiveness to the
business community, whose arguments of the cost of the legislation
are innocuous and untrue,'' state AFL-CIO President Edward J.
Cleary saud Friday.
   But Executive Patrick Halpin told reporters that several
businesses threatened to leave the county or cancel relocation
plans if he signed the legislation.
   ``In both cases, the consequence would be hundreds, if not
thousands of jobs lost, and these are losses that I do not think
Suffolk can afford,'' Halpin said.
   Under the bill, employers would be required to pay 80 percent of
the cost of eye examinations, glass lenses and frames on a yearly
basis, if needed.
   It also required 15-minute work breaks every three hours and
outlined strict work station standards, including what type of
chairs should be used, adjustability of the terminals and office
lighting.
   ``This law would cost local businesses millions of dollars to
implement at the same time that their competitors in other areas
faced no restrictions,'' Halpin said. ``This would be an economic
disadvantage to them of no small consequence.''
   Donald Rechler, chairman of the Association for a Better Long
Island, a group of 40 developers, said after the veto was announced
Friday: ``The economy of Suffolk County has just breathed a sigh of
relief.''
   The Legislature could override Halpin's veto with 12 votes. The
measure was originally approved by 13 of the 18 legislators.

<HEAD>Kitchen Band Entertains Nursing Home Residents With Old Songs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McHENRY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A band of widows low on talent but high on
spirit grabbed a few unconventional musical instruments _ a
washboard, a soap bottle filled with beans and a teapot _ donned
floral aprons, and embarked on a sentimental journey.
   ``You don't have to have talent,'' said one of the Happy
Tooters, Frances Widhalm, after a recent performance. ``Almost none
of us does. All you have to do is like music.''
   At 88, Mrs. Widhalm is the oldest of the Happy Tooters, with the
youngest being 62. The 15 women, all widows, perform at nursing
homes and retirement villages, choosing their material with people
their own age in mind.
   The songs are traditional, like ``Melody of Love,'' ``Alley
Cat'' and ``Peg O' My Heart.'' The orchestration, however, is
anything but traditional.
   The Happy Tooters play kazoos, shake soap bottles filled with
beans and croon into the spouts of teapots. Pianist Isabelle Miller
and drummer Madeline Behm play the only ``real'' instruments, but
someone occasionally chimes in on the triangle.
   Like any band worth its gigs, the Happy Tooters have uniforms _
blue floral aprons over white blouses with blue floral bonnets to
match.
   ``I've never sat in the audience, so I don't know what we sound
like,'' said Marion Schmitt, 74, of McHenry. ``But we do have fun,
and I think we do bring pleasure to people.''
   Mrs. Schmitt, the band's organizer and conductor, said she first
organized a kitchen band in November 1985, when her chapter of
Naim, a Roman Catholic support group for widows and widowers, was
slated to provide entertainment at a dinner in the Rockford diocese.
   The Happy Tooters made their debut March 9, 1986. It was
supposed to be a one-shot deal, but the show biz bug bit. They've
been touring northern Illinois ever since _ weather permitting.
   ``The ladies are getting up in age,'' Mrs. Schmitt explained.
``We try not to peform too much in July and August, when it's hot.''
   Cold weather and rain can also be a problem.
   ``We don't like to travel when the weather is unstable, we're
such a bunch of crips,'' Mrs. Miller said. ``But playing for people
makes us feel better.''
   Mrs. Schmitt pointed out to the elderly and infirm people who
were beginning to gather in the activity room at a home before a
performance.
   ``You see some pretty sad faces out there,'' she said. ``It
makes us feel good to see them smile.''

   An unseasonable cold wave lingered over much of the nation
today, bringing chilly temperatures from the Great Lakes region
through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys with freeze warnings posted
for Maryland and West Virginia.
   The freezing temperatures damaged some corn crops in St. Cloud,
Minn., and some farmers may have to replant, agriculture agent
Burton Olson said.
   Freeze and frost warnings were posted for extreme western
Maryland and for the northern and central mountains of West
Virginia.
   Much of the nation was dry Friday night and early this morning.
But showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered from western
and central parts of New Mexico through the east slopes of the
Colorado Rockies and Nebraska to eastern Montana and western North
Dakota.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across northern
Florida and the southern tip through the Florida Keys.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms along
southern Florida and central Colorado; and sunny skies over the
rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the upper 60s and the 70s
from New England across northern Florida, from the Tennessee Valley
across New York, also along the northern Rockies and the Pacific
Coast; in the 90s from the northern half of the Plains, as well as
from central Texas across western Texas, New Mexico and western
Colorado; in the 90s to about 110 through the desert Southwest; in
the 80s over the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 37

   A federal jury will take the weekend off
before resuming deliberations in a cigarette liability lawsuit
carried on by the widower of a lung-cancer victim who smoked for 40
years.
   The jury considering the Cipollone case ended their fourth day
of deliberations about 5 p.m. Friday with no verdict. It will
resume deliberations Monday.
   Jurors asked few questions during deliberations, which began at
noon Tuesday. They are considering whether or not to award damages
to Antonio Cipollone for the 1984 death of his wife, Rose, at 58.
   During the four-month trial, he charged that cigarette-makers
Lorillard Inc., Liggett Group Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. misled
the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking and contributed
to Mrs. Cipollone's death.
   The companies contend she made an intelligent, strong-willed
choice to smoke knowing the risks. They argue smoking is not a
proven cancer-cause, and that her type of cancer isn't linked to
cigarettes anyway.
   On Friday, jurors asked if the 1984 Surgeon General's report on
smoking and health was in evidence and whether they could see it.
It wasn't, and the judge said they couldn't.

   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian guerrillas
and Syrian-backed dissidents battled for control of two Beirut
refugee camps for the fourth day today. Police reported eight
people killed and 17 wounded.
   That raised the casualty toll since fighting erupted Wednesday
in the Bourj el-Barajneh and Chatilla camps to 18 dead and 77
wounded by police count.
   Police said Arafat's Fatah faction, the main component of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising battled with howitzers, mortars, rocket-propelled
grenades and machine guns.
   The fighting raged despite efforts by a security commitee made
up of representatives from several Palestinian groups to arrange a
cease fire.
   ``Several cease-fire calls overnight were ignored,'' said a
police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   A Fatah spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his
guerrillas ``repulsed several overnight attacks from outside the
camps'' by Mousa's fighters.
   Arafat loyalists had dislodged Mousa's guerrillas from both
shantytowns in a series of battles over the last two months. But
the dissidents have regrouped on the fringes of the shantytowns,
where Syrian troops are in control.
   Mousa broke away from the PLO in a Syrian-inspired 1983 mutiny
against Arafat's leadership and established his headquarters in
Damascus, the Syrtian capital.
   Clashes between the rival groups have persisted in the Beirut
camps despite a reconciliation effort between Arafat and Syrian
President Hafez Assad to end their 5-year-old feud.

<TEXT>
   Authorities have discovered dozens of
decaying bodies ``stacked like cord wood'' inside a closed funeral
home and dug up the yard outside in search of more.
   ``We're treating it as a mass disaster right now,'' said Lou
Eliopulos, chief investigator for the Medical Examiner's Office.
   So far, 44 bodies have been found inside the Howell Morning
Glory Chapel funeral home.
   The state Department of Professional Regulation suspended owner
Lewis J. Howell's permit to operate a funeral home on Wednesday
after the initial discovery of eight decomposed bodies.
   After the bodies were discovered during a routine state
inspection last week, Howell said he hadn't disposed of the bodies
either because family members couldn't be reached for instructions
or because the city hadn't given him needed paperwork for indigent
burials.
   The chapel has no refrigeration units.
   ``At this point, I am convinced that there are no more bodies in
the building,'' Lt. Jim Suber said Friday night after 36 bodies
were found. ``We are finished here today.''
   However, officials planned to bring in a front-end loader to dig
up the yard behind Howell Morning Glory Chapel to search for
bodies, The Florida Times-Union and Jacksonville Journal reported
in today's editions.
   Florida Department of Law Enforcement technicians who dug up
portions of the yard Friday searching for evidence of burials found
nothing.
   But that was not the case inside the building.
   Some of the bodies found were ``stacked like cord wood in the
closet,'' one unidentified official told the newspaper.
   The bodies on the bottom of the pile, he said, ``were more like
skeletons than corpses.''
   Meanwhile, of the original eight bodies found, four were buried
in the city's indigent cemetery and four were cremated, said Virgil
Green, chief of the city Welfare Division.
   One had died July 17, 1987. Three others died in January and a
fifth died in April, Green said. Records could not be found to
determine the date of death for the other three bodies found
earlier in the week.

<TEXT>
   Southern and central Californians were jolted
by a strong earthquake that sent rocks flying onto a freeway and
closed an aqueduct that supplies half of Los Angeles' water.
   Three people in nearby Whittier were injured by a falling
avocado tree in Friday's earthquake. One woman was treated at the
scene and two men were taken to a hospital for tests.
   The quake forced the closure of the 440-mile-long California
Aqueduct when power to at least two pumping plants was knocked out.
   The temblor, measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck at 4:06
p.m. and was centered on the Garlock Fault, 11 miles
north-northeast of Gorman, or about 70 miles northwest of downtown
Los Angeles, said Robert Finn, a spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   State Department of Water Resources officials in Sacramento said
crews worked overnight to reopen the aqueduct and that the city
should not face a water shortage.
   ``For L.A. there's no problem, the storage lakes have an ample
water supply,'' said Mike McGregor, a spokesman for the state
Department of Water Resources. He said the aqueduct would remain
closed at least through today.
   But he said the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water District, about
50 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, was asked to conserve
because it had a smaller supply.
   The quake catapulted rocks onto the northbound lanes of
Interstate 5 near the Grapevine, but traffic continued to flow
while crews removed the rocks, said California Highway Patrol
Officer Jerry Berger at the Fort Tejon station. There were no
immediate reports of accidents from the rockslide, he said.
   ``It was a real violent jolt,'' Berger said.
   A series of aftershocks also were measured by Caltech, with the
biggest measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale at 4:22 p.m., said Riley
Geary, a seismic analyst.
   The Garlock Fault, where the quake struck, is the second-largest
fault in California, with a length of 200 miles, compared with the
600-mile-long San Andreas Fault, said U.S. Geological Survey
seismologist Lucile Jones.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   The army ordered a speedup in the judicial
review process for some of the 5,000 Palestinian arrested during
the Arab uprising in the occupied territories. Defense officials
said the new system would benefit detainees by increasing judicial
supervision.
   But Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab today called the move a
charade and said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the changes
after all detainees decided last week to challenge the system by
filing appeals.
   About 2,000 Arabs are being held for up to six months without
charges, most of them taken into custody since the uprising began
Dec. 8. They are called administrative detainees. The army also
holds about 3,000 Arabs awaiting trial or serving prison terms on
charges of anti-Israeli violence.
   Underground leaders of the uprising set aside today as a ``Day
of Solidarity'' with Palestinian prisoners and called for renewed
anti-Israeli protests.
   On Friday, soldiers bulldozed the cinderblock house of an Arab
from the West Bank refugee camp Jelazoun after he was arrested on
suspicion that he stabbed an Israeli-appointed Arab mayor.
   In the West Bank village of Beita, troops expelled about 100
Israelis who were planting olive trees to protest the army's
uprooting of orchards and demolition of 14 Arab houses.
   The army measures were in reprisal for an April 6 clash between
villagers and Israeli teen-age West Bank settlers in which two
Arabs and a 15-year-old Jewish girl were killed.
   Also Friday, the Government Press Office reinstated the press
credentials of NBC Television correspondend Martin Fletcher after a
six-week suspension imposed because he allegedly violated military
censorship.
   Kuttab said the changes in the appeals process were ordered
because under the current system, the army would be unable to deal
with the expected wave of appeals.
   ``Within the next two weeks, all detainees will have filed
appeals,'' Kuttab told The Associated Press. ``This is going to
impose a heavy burden on the system.''
   Under present rules, a three-member military committee hears the
appeals, and then refers the case to the area commander for a final
decision.
   Rabin on Friday ordered a military judge to take the place of
the review committee and make the final ruling in the case, said
ministry spokesman Eitan Haber.
   Haber said the new system would benefit the detainees by
speeding up the appeals process. Israel radio quoted military
officials as saying Rabin also ordered the changes to increase
judicial supervision over administrative detention cases.
   Several weeks into the uprising, the army scrapped a major legal
safeguard for the detainees which required that they appear before
a judge within four days after their arrest.
   In Jelazoun, the army demolished the home of 26-year-old Khamis
Jawdat Faraj, arrested Thursday on charges he knifed Mayor Hassan
Tawil, 74, of the West Bank town El Bireh as an act of Palestinian
nationalism.
   Israel radio said Faraj confessed to stabbing Tawil, who was
recovering at a Jerusalem hospital.
   It took about 30 minutes for a big yellow bulldozer to level the
three-room house where Faraj lived with his 60-year-old mother. An
almond tree, a plum tree and a rose bush were left standing in the
yard.
   The army said Faraj was detained several times previously for
alleged participation in anti-Israeli disturbances.
   The tree-planting ceremony in Beita was organized by the
``Committee for Beita,'' a group trying to force authorities to
make reparations to villagers whose homes were destroyed or damaged
by the army as punishment.
   Jewish settlers and the army initially blamed the villagers for
the death of Israeli Tirza Porat in the April clash, but an army
report later determined she was accidentally killed by a bullet
fired by an Israeli guarding the group.

   Two Europeans and a Filipino of
German descent arrested this week for alleged links with communist
rebels have been charged with murder and kidnapping, the military
said today.
   Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido, chief of the military's Southern
Luzon Command, said in a telephone interview the charges were filed
by his legal officer Friday before a civil court in Quezon province.
   Galido declined to elaborate on the charges but said his command
had ``heavy evidence'' against the Rev. Klaus Schmidt, 52, a West
German Protestant minister; Stellan Hermansson, 30, a Swede who
says he is a free-lance journalist; and Antonio Bosch, a Filipino
businessman.
   Members of Sweden's Young Communist League said Friday in
Stockholm that Hermansson was their president. They said he arrived
in the Philippines on May 18 to gather information for lectures and
was to return to Sweden today.
   Hermansson and the two others were arrested during what the
military called ``clearing operations'' Wednesday in a
rebel-infested area of Quezon province. They were being held at the
command headquarters in the provincial capital, Lucena, 60 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Command spokesman Col. Hernani Figueroa said earlier the charges
stem from a New People's Army raid on the Quezon town of San
Francisco in February. Two people were killed in the attack, and
the rebels abducted two soldiers who later escaped.
   Hermansson denied the charges, said Eha Arg, first secretary of
the Swedish embassy, who visited him Friday. She said he told her
he was not even in the country in February.
   Galido said it was up to the judge to decide whether to grant
the three bail. The judge of the Municipal Circuit Court in
Mulanay, in Quezon province, has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday.

   A man mistaken by police as a fugitive killer
featured on a television crime show says he was frisked, handcuffed
and arrested before police realized they had the wrong man.
   ``Two of them had guns on me,'' Gary Bennett said in an article
in today's editions of the New York Daily News. ``One cop told me
if I would have moved or even twitched, he would have shot me.''
   Bennett, 28, said he thought the four officers who approached
him in a shopping mall parking lot were going to ticket him for his
car's noisy muffler.
   Instead, he was taken to the station house for two hours because
police thought he resembled the fugitive shown on the ``America's
Most Wanted'' television show.
   The Fox Television show, which features a different fugitive
each week, focused its May 22 episode on Carmine Esposito, 40, the
son of an alleged member of the Genovese crime family. Esposito is
sought in the 1983 murder of Timothy Dorsey, 25, who was gunned
down in a New York City restaurant.
   After the show aired, police in Mount Pocono, Pa., received a
tip that Esposito was in the area.
   Last Tuesday, police arrested Bennett, originally of New York
City. After an FBI check proved he was not a fugitive, he was
released.
   ``If we didn't follow up on the lead, we would have been
criticized,'' said Mount Pocono Police Chief David Swiderski.

<HEAD>More Than 200 Alleged Gang Members Arrested In Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested more than 200 suspected gang
members in a 1,000-officer sweep that ended this morning in an
ongoing effort to rid the nation's second-largest city of
gang-related crime.
   ``We want to reassure the public that we're still committed to
solving the gang problem,'' said Deputy Police Chief William
Rathburn. ``We don't want the public to think we've gone away, so
we'll run these (sweeps) periodically to reassure them,'' he said.
   ``We're throwing out the big net,'' Rathburn added.
   Lt. Jim Tatreau said final tallies on the number arrested were
not available early today ``but it will be over 200 when we add
them all up.''
   ``There were definitely a lot of rock cocaine arrests, some
arrests for possesion of narcotics for sale, and there were
numerous weapons confiscated, including an AK47 assault rifle,''
Tatreau said.
   He said those arrested for serious crimes were held at city
jails while those picked up on lesser charges, such as driving
under the influence of alcohol, were released.
   The sweep, the second such police operation in two months, began
at 1 p.m. Friday when 1,000 officers fanned out across the city
looking for alleged gang members.
   ``We're going to do it again and again,'' said Police Chief
Daryl Gates at a briefing before the officers hit the streets.
   Half of the officers were deployed in the city's gang-ridden
South Central area neighborhoods.
   The last time 1,000 officers were out in force against gangs was
on April 8 and April 9 when Mayor Tom Bradley ordered them to
``take back the streets.''
   That sweep netted 1,453 arrests during its two days.
   Tatreau declined to say if the most recent gang sweep would
continue again tonight. But Rathburn had said earlier it could last
for several days.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll in a Soviet train explosion neared
100 as workers picked through rubble in the city of Arzamas, a
newspaper said today, blaming the blast on the improper transport
of industrial explosives.
   The force of the explosion made it difficult to determine
exactly how many died, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
reported, saying the toll ``was approaching 100.'' It added that
200 people were hospitalized and 700 familes left homeless in the
industrial city 240 miles east of Moscow.
   Shortly after the explosion, a week ago today, the state-run
media put the death toll at 73. It rose to 80 on Wednesday. More
are missing and unaccounted for, Pravda said.
   The explosion caused millions of dollars in damages, Pravda
said, without giving a specific figure.
   Investigators have not yet determined what sparked the blast,
but it apparently stemmed from improper loading and handling of
explosives.
   It was clear ``the crew did not know what they were carrying,''
wrote Pravda correspondent V. Lisin.
   ``The cargo list on the train listed one type of explosive, but
in the wagons themselves ... was another more dangerous substance.
Worse than that, two types of explosives were placed together in
the first wagon, which is categorically forbidden,'' it said.
   Examination of wagons which did not blow up, Pravda said,
revealed ``severe violations of the rules for the transportation of
dangerous cargos.''
   Detailed reports of disasters were unheard of before Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in March 1985 and began
the policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater discussion of some formerly
taboo subjects

   An American Airlines jumbo jet from Dallas
carrying 185 people came in on only two of its three engines when
an oil warning light prompted the pilot to shut down the third, the
airline said.
   None of the 172 passengers or 13 crew members was injured, and
the DC-10 landed one minute early Friday evening at Los Angeles
International Airport, said airline spokesman John Raymond.
   ``On final approach the pilot encountered a low oil-pressure
light. He shut down the engine that the light involved,'' Raymond
said. ``It was a perfectly normal landing.''
   ``The oil pressure light will be checked out,'' Raymond said.
``Frequently a faulty light causes this. Either it's a bad light or
there may be a problem with the engine and that will be fixed,
too.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the
incident, said an FAA regional duty officer who refused to give his
name.
   The jet was docked since Flight 79 from Dallas-Fort Worth was
the final American Airlines flight to Los Angeles for the day.
Raymond said it will be inspected by airline mechanics in Los
Angeles.
   A DC-10 can hold a maximum 290 passengers, not including the
crew, Raymond said.

   U.S. Rep. Cass Ballenger appreciated a
letter of congratulations from President Reagan's daughter,
Maureen, but he says he's his mother's son _ not his mother's
daughter.
   In a June 2 letter addressed to ``Ms. Cass Ballenger,'' Ms.
Reagan, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, wrote,
``On behalf of the Republican Party, I would like to congratulate
you on your candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives.
   ``As you know, the participation of women like yourself is the
driving force behind the continual advancement of women in
policy-making arenas across the country. We are so proud that you
will be representing the Republican Party in this important race.''
   ``Dear Maurie,'' the freshman congressman responded. ``If women
like me are a driving force in policy making, the Republican Party
may have some difficulties that neither of us had considered.
Before I get too exercised, however, I would want to discuss this
entire issue with my wife Don(na).''
   Ballenger enclosed an autographed picture of himself taken in
the Capitol.
   ``The gentleman to my left is my namesake, Lewis Cass, who
served as the first governor of Michigan, a member of the House of
Representatives, a member of the U.S. Senate, secretary of war,
secretary of state and ambassador to France,'' Ballenger wrote.
   ``On reflection, my parents may have been well advised to name
me Lewis.'' Ballenger's administrative assistant Max Veale said
Friday the congressman had not heard back from Ms. Reagan. Similar
mistakes about Ballenger's first name have been made before, he
said.
   ``We started to suggest she check with her father, `Rhonda,' who
knows the congressman well and wouldn't make the same mistake,''
Veale said.

   PUT-IN-BAY, Ohio (AP) _ Jay Faris was the star of his high
school class, graduating as valedictorian, not to mention class
president. He also ranked last.
   ``It felt kind of weird at first, but I got used to it,'' said
Faris, 18, the Lake Erie resort town's only graduating senior.
   Faris said it was lonely at times, but that he enjoyed telling
people he was valedictorian and class president.
   ``Absolutely. That's what I tell people. Then I tell them the
truth, rather than they find out,'' Faris said after his graduation
ceremony Friday night.
   Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard gave a five-minute commencement address to
Faris and the 200 guests, and talked with Faris briefly afterward.
   ``It was a really good speech,'' Faris said by telephone. ``He
told me all of Ohio is proud of me.''
   The graduate said he has enjoyed being in the spotlight. ``I
liked it,'' said Faris, the son of the school's superintendent. ``I
can't really say I was ever tired of it.''
   Faris had requested a commencement speaker who was a political
personality and well-known.
   Leonard, upon hearing Faris' request, quipped, ``At least I meet
one of his two criteria.''
   Faris said he plans to major in law enforcement at the
University of Toledo this fall after working at a gas station this
summer.
   There are 80 students enrolled from kindergarten through the
12th grade at the school, on South Bass Island in western Lake Erie.

   Radical students hurling firebombs
attacked the Foreign Ministry and the prime minister's office
today, and student leaders vowed to stage another march to North
Korea for unification talks.
   Police said 26 students forced their way past guards at a back
gate of the Combined Central Government Building in downtown Seoul
and hurled at least 10 firebombs at the complex. Eight of the
attackers barricaded themselves in a third-floor cafeteria before
they were seized by police.
   Nobody was injured in the attack in which windows were smashed
and a police guard post and a waiting room blackened by flames and
smoke. Police said they arrested 18 attackers and that the others
fled.
   The building, across the street from the U.S. Embassy, houses
the prime minister's office, the Foreign Ministry and other major
government departments.
   Small clashes also were reported today in the provincial cities
of Taeju and Kwangju as riot police firing volleys of tear gas
dispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs. No injuries or
arrests were immediately reported.
   The attacks were mounted after riot police blocked thousands of
radical students on Friday from mounting a march to the North
Korean border for talks on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula.
Fighting began on Friday when police fired tear gas to drive back
students who hurled firebombs and battled with rocks and clubs to
try and break through to the border.
   Police officials said today that more than 800 students were
arrested in the clashes the day before. More than 100 police and
students were injured in the street clashes, they said.
   About 60,000 riot police were deployed to halt the march to the
border truce site of Panmunjom. Riot police remained on alert today
and troopers guarded key government buildings and U.S. diplomatic
offices.
   Radical leaders at a rally today at Yonsei University in the
west of Seoul vowed to mount another march to the border on Aug.
15, national independence day, and said they would not abandon the
reunification drive.
   ``Our struggle has ignited the mind of the people who want
reunficition of our land,'' one leader said in a speech.
   About 2,000 students applauded the speakers and shouted slogans.
But the students' mood was subdued and thousands of others who had
gathered at the campus for the march Friday left overnight.
   Speakers continued to denounce the United States and demand the
withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact.
   ``Yankee go home'' and ``Reunification,'' students chanted.
   Radicals claim the United States enforces partition of the
Korean peninsula so it can rule the south as a virtual colony. A
wave of violent anti-American protests has hit South Korea during
the past month.
   The radicals, who represent between 10 percent and 20 percent of
college students, have failed to attract popular support with their
reunification campaign. The main opposition parties urged radicals
to abandon the march, saying it lacked public support.
   Most people in South Korea fear the totalitarian north is
determined to conquer the south. North Korea invaded the south in
1950 to start the Korean War and the two nations remain bitter
opponents.
   The North Korean government said its student delegates waited
Friday at Panmunjom for the South Korean students. It denounced the
United States and the South Korean government, claiming they want
to block reunification.

<HEAD>Pro-Government Paper Joins Outcry Over New Press Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A loyal pro-government
newspaper today joined the outcry against new press restrictions,
and a prominent black moderate pleaded for the release of jailed
guerrilla leader Nelson Mandela.
   The new restrictions took effect Friday when the government
reimposed the nationwide state of emergency for a third year. They
tighten curbs on reporting about opposition activity and require
some journalists to register with the government.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg daily, joined a wide
range of journalists, anti-apartheid leaders and others in
criticizing the restrictions.
   ``There is only one word for the new press curbs and that is
overkill,'' The Citizen's editorial said.
   It said the government appeared to have reached the point where
it was barring newspapers from reporting ``matters of vital concern
to everyone.'' It added: ``That will mean the public will be
uninformed and subject to rumor.'
   The Foreign Correspondents Association said in a statement: ``We
observe with irony that South Africa is progressively shutting down
the free flow of information at a time when the Soviet Union _
frequently depicted here as an enemy of press freedom _ is
noticeably moving towards a more open society.''
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the KwaZulu homeland and one of
the blacks the government would like to draw into a
white-controlled power-sharing arrangement, said the extension of
the emergency was a tragedy.
   At an outdoor meeting near Durban, Buthelezi also appealed for
the release of Mandela, who is serving a life prison sentence for
his actions as leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   ``Black South Africa will not rest until he is free,'' Buthelezi
said. ``Nothing the South African government can do will gain it
credibility while it treats Dr. Mandela as a dangerous enemy.''
   Buthelezi said Mandela might be the only person capable of
ending a bloody power stuggle in Natal province between militants
who support the ANC and more conservative blacks who follow
Buthelezi.
   ``I believe he (Mandela) would come out of jail to thump anybody
... who set black brother against black brother on the eve of a
final black victory over apartheid,'' Buthelezi said.
   As he spoke, about 70,000 fans packed London's Wembley Stadium
for a 10-hour rock concert honoring Mandela.
   Although the British Broadcasting Corp. pledged to cover the
extravaganza as a musical, not a political event, its commentator
referred to Mandela as ``a political prisoner.'' The South African
government threatened this week to expel the BBC for its allegedly
biased coverage of the government.
   One of the new restrictions imposed in South Africa on Friday
outlaws advocacy of a boycott of nationwide municipal elections
scheduled for October.
   Most major anti-apartheid groups, including 17 which were banned
in February, oppose black participation in elections organized by
the white authorities until blacks have voting rights on a national
level.
   The new regulations make it illegal to quote anti-government
statements from members of the 17 organizations and prohibit
newspapers from quoting any ANC members.
   Another new rule requires local news agencies, except for the
South African Press Association, to register with the government.
These small domestic news agencies, many of them aggressive in
covering anti-apartheid activity, could be ordered to submit their
dispatches to a government censor.
   A group of these alternative news agencies _ the East Cape News
Agencies _said the new regulation could be ``the first step on the
road to compulsory registration of all journalists ... with the
threat of deregistration if they misbehave.''
   The government ``seeks a nation of ignorant, pliant subjects,''
it said.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's jail population dropped below the
court-ordered limit, allowing the city to hold prisoners unable to
raise bail, officials said.
   The jail population this morning was 3,813, under the 3,850
maximum permitted by the court on weekends and holidays, Bail
Commissioner Charles Murray said. For other days, the maximum
prison population is set at 3,750.
   Since Wednesday many people, including alleged drug dealers, had
avoided jail when unable to raise bail because of the order by U.S.
District Judge Norma Shapiro that limited the city's prison
population.
   At the time the jails held nearly 4,000 men and women.
   The city began freeing prisoners on their own recognizance if
they were awaiting trial and had been unable to raise bail of
$2,500 or less.
   On Friday afternoon, Prison Superintendent Edmund Lyons said the
jails held 3,690 people and that, starting this morning, those
unable to raise bail would be held.
   ``The prison is open and people can be admitted on a regular
basis,'' Murray said early today. ``The moratorium right now is
lifted.''
   District Attorney Ronald Castille has termed the jail moratorium
``lunacy,'' charging that city prisons can hold as many as 4,300
inmates.
   Castille called on Mayor W. Wilson Goode to seek to have the cap
raised or find alternate confinement space.
   Prisoners who brought the lawsuit charged that Philadelphia's
prisons were overcrowded. They had demanded that each of the city's
3,200 cells should have only one person.
   Excluded from the moratorium are those charged with murder,
attempted murder, rape, attempted rape, kidnapping, arson, robbery
and aggravated assault in addition to crimes involving use of a gun
or knife or large amounts of drugs.
   Meanwhile, the city moved closer to increasing its cell space by
awarding a construction contract for a new $165 million Criminal
Justice Center. The center _ with jail space for 440 people, plus
courtrooms _ is expected to be completed in 1991.

<HEAD>Saragat, Former Italian President, Dead At 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Giuseppe Saragat, Italy's first
socialist president and a strong supporter of workers' rights, died
today of complications from heart disease, an official said. He was
89.
   Saragat, a founder of the Social Democrat Party, died at his
house in Rome, said a party official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The former president had suffered from cardiovascular
problems for years.
   Saragat became the fifth president of the Italian Republic in
1964. After he left office in 1971, he served as president of his
party.
   In 1922, at the age of 24, Saragat joined the Socialist Party
but left Italy after Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini came to
power the same year.
   Saragat fled to Austria and then in 1926 to Saint-Gaudens,
France. He returned to Italy after the Italian armistice with the
Allies in 1943 and was arrested for anti-Fascist activity.
   He escaped, was recaptured and escaped a second time together
with Sandro Petrini, who also later became president.
   In 1946, Saragat became president of the Constituent Assembly
that framed Italy's republican postwar constitution.
   He broke with the Socialists in 1947 and helped found the
Socialist Party of Italian Workers, which later became the Social
Democrat Party. As secretary of the new party, Saragat built it
into a staunchly pro-Western and anti-Communist leftist force.
   He was later elected to Parliament four times as a Social
Democrat and championed radical reforms in housing, medical care,
education and taxation.
   ``The republic loses in Giuseppe Saragat a central figure in the
fight against fascism and Stalinism,'' said Premier Ciriaco De
Mita, leader of the Christian Democrats.
   Saragat was born September 19, 1898, in the northern industrial
city of Turin. He obtained a university degree in economics and
commerce. While a bank clerk, he wrote for a newspaper and turned
out political books.
   Saragat, who was fond of Roman philosophers, was known for his
gentle and easy-going manner. He was so relaxed about politics that
he often put its difficult maneuverings second to lively literary
conversation on his favorite authors, Goethe and Pascal.
   He once told a political leader who had waited for a long time
to see him: ``I am sorry for keeping you waiting so long, but I was
engaged in a talk with (Nobel Prize-winning poet Salvatore)
Quasimodo. Poetry should come before politics sometimes, don't you
think?''
   Saragat is survived by a daughter, Ernestina Santacatterina, and
a son, Giovanni. A funeral was scheduled for Monday.

   John Wesley Fletcher, the evangelist who
Jessica Hahn says introduced her to PTL founder Jim Bakker, has
filed for bankruptcy.
   Fletcher listed debts of $4 million and assets of $111,755,
mainly his home, in the filing Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Fletcher's petition, under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code,
calls for liquidation of a debtor's assets or property to pay off
creditors. However, his filing indicated there is little property
to liquidate.
   Fletcher and his wife, Shirley, asked in the filing that their
property be exempted from liquidation.
   Fletcher's ministry operated under the John Wesley Fletcher
Evangelistic Association. But Fletcher said in his bankruptcy
petition that his association has no assets and is ``no longer
functional as a corporation.
   The petition listed secured creditors, those having priority to
any assets, as having claims of $367,050. The remaining $3.7
million is in unsecured debt, including loans and bills for
services.
   The sex scandal involving Ms. Hahn forced Bakker to resign as
head of the PTL.

   A county prosecutor said he would
investigate the fatal shooting of a Hispanic man by an off-duty
police officer, and for the first time in three nights this
industrial city was relatively quiet.
   Some people drove by police and yelled insults at them Friday
night, witnesses said, adding that police yelled insults back.
However, unlike Wednesday and Thursday nights, there were no
incidents of violence reported.
   Mayor George J. Otlowski and Hispanic leaders hammered out an
agreement in a three-hour meeting with Middlesex County Prosecutor
Alan Rockoff, less than 24 hours after about 1,000 rioters clashed
with police following the funeral for the slain man.
   Rockoff said after Friday's meeting that his office will
investigate the shooting and present the case to a county grand
jury. The two sides also agreed to form a commission to investigate
bias in the city of about 39,000 and to form a community council to
hear grievances about police conduct, he said.
   ``Most of the people here really want justice,'' said the Rev.
Richard Todd of Our Lady of Fatima Roman Catholic Church, where the
funeral for the slain man was held Thursday. ``But they also want
peace in our town.
   ``A lot of what happened last night was because when crowds get
big there is not a lot of control,'' Todd said Friday.
   Terms of the agreement were printed and distributed in the
city's Hispanic community Friday. The population of Perth Amboy,
about 15 miles south of Newark, is evenly divided between whites
and Hispanics.
   The earlier violence was touched off when off-duty narcotics
officer Allen C. Fuller shot and killed Carmen Coria and critically
wounded Coria's brother, Matteo, outside a bar early Monday.
   Fuller said he fired at the men because he believed his life was
threatened by Carmen Coria, who he said approached him holding a
bottle. Fuller was suspended with pay pending the outcome of the
investigation.

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 people jammed St.
Vitus Cathedral today for the consecration of two assistant
bishops, the first such Roman Catholic appointments allowed by the
communist government since 1973.
   After the ceremony, hundreds of people shouted slogans such as
``Long Live Father Cardinal!'' ``Long Live the Pope!'' and ``We
Want Religious Freedom!'' outside the palace of Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek.
   Tomasek, the head of Czechoslovakia's Catholic church,
officiated at a two-hour ceremony to mark the formal appointment of
Jan Lebeda, the 75-year-old Vicar General of Prague, and
64-year-old priest Antonin Liska as assistant bishops of Prague.
   Their appointment should lighten the workload of the 88-year-old
Cardinal.
   Papal emissary Francesco Colasuonno and Catholic officials from
neighboring Poland, West and East Germany, Austria and Hungary were
among those attending the majestic ritual in the cathedral.
   Colasuonno later shook hands with those who rallied outside
Tomasek's palace.
   Demonstrations involving hundreds of Catholics for religious
freedom have taken place almost every Sunday after Mass around the
cathedral and Tomasek's palace.
   A recent warming in relations between churches and the atheist
Communist authorities in the Soviet Union has not led to similar
church-state improvements in Czechoslovakia.
   After long negotiations with the government, the Vatican failed
to fill any of the 10 vacant sees in Czechoslovakia, where the
authorities have not approved any new bishops since 1973. Lebeda
and Liska are the first new assistant bishops since 1973.
   Tomasek has come under attack from state-run media in recent
months for supporting a petition for more religious freedom that
has garnered an estimated 600,000 signatures.
   In April, the cardinal wrote to Premier Lubomir Strougal urging
that the church and the authorities open a new dialogue. The offer
was rejected.

   Entertainer Harry Belafonte, a veteran
anti-apartheid campaigner, today kicked off a 10-hour rock concert
honoring Nelson Mandela by calling on South Africa to release the
black leader from prison.
   Belafonte, speaking to 70,000 fans at London's Wembley Stadium,
gave a brief but stirring message to Mandela on his upcoming 70th
birthday.
   Belafonte called Mandela a symbol of South Africa's ``cruel and
unjust system of apartheid,'' and said: ``We want to see you and
your fellow political prisoners freed.'' Cheers and a chorus of
``Happy Birthday'' rose from the mostly youthful throng.
   The British rock star Sting then began the peformance, which
organizers said would be seen on television by 750 million people
in 60 countries.
   Although the British Broadcasting Corp. pledged to cover the
extravaganza as a musical, not a political event, its commentator
referred to Mandela as ``a political prisoner.'' The South African
government threatened this week to expel the BBC for its allegedly
biased coverage of the government.
   Organizers said the concert, modeled on the 1985 Live Aid
``global jukebox'' for African famine relief, launches a five-week
series of rallies and celebrations in Britain leading up to
Mandela's 70th birthday on July 18.
   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress, was
among eight ANC leaders sentenced to life imprisonment 24 years ago
today for sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government. He has
since become South Africa's most prominent political prisoner.
   About 40 pop stars and groups _ including Whitney Houston and
Phil Collins _ were to perform on a huge stage at the north London
stadium.
   The Anti-Apartheid Movement organizers say half the proceeds
from the $45 tickets will go to seven children's charities in
southern Africa and the rest will fund its activities in Britain.
   Six hours of the concert was to be telecast in the United States
today by Fox Broadcasting, the Los Angeles-based network.
   The concert has been denounced by the South African government
and by right-wingers in Britain who claim that by televising it,
the BBC is violating its duty to be impartial.
   A BBC statement said the BBC is not paying for broadcast rights
and views the concert purely as ``an outstanding international
musical event.''
   Published reports said that when a message from Mandela smuggled
out of Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town is read to the crowd, cameras
would cut from the stage to interviews.
   In London, 25 lawmakers in the governing Conservative Party
signed a House of Commons motion saying the BBC was violating its
rules by giving ``publicity to a movement that encourages the
African National Congress in its terrorist activities.''
   ``You can only say it is a political event because he (Mandela)
is a political prisoner,'' countered Archbishop Trevor Huddleston,
the main organizer of the show.
   South Africa said its London embassy complained to the BBC ``at
the highest level'' about broadcasting the concert and hinted it
might expel BBC reporters.
   That complaint follows one on Thursday by South African Law and
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok who said the BBC might be ordered out
of South Africa because of a film it broadcast in Britain this week
about detained black children in South Africa.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   ANC President Oliver Tambo is billed as the concert's guest of
honor. The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting South Africa's
government.
   Scheduled performers include George Michael, Miriam Makeba, Hugh
Masekela, Dire Straits, Eurythmics, Simple Minds, Roberta Flack,
Natalie Cole, the Bee Gees, Joe Cocker, Fat Boys, Ashford and
Simpson, Joan Armatrading, Bryan Adams, Paul Young, Jackson Browne,
Al Green and Jerry Dammers.
   There were to be several big-name surprise singers, raising a
rash of speculation in London's tabloid newspapers. The Sun chose
guitarist-singer Eric Clapton as the secret special guest, while
The Star tipped Michael Jackson to veer from his European tour.
   Among the hosts were singer Meatloaf, comedienne Whoopi
Goldberg, actresses Jennifer Beals, Darryl Hannah and Ali McGraw,
and film maker Sir Richard Attenborough.
   U.S. opera singer Jessye Norman closes the event with ``Nkosi
Sikelele Africa'' (God Bless Africa), the national anthem of the
ANC and several African states.

   In a victory for anti-abortion groups,
Presbyterian leaders have urged a change in the denomination's
pro-choice position, while others struggled with a major church
statement on nuclear weapons.
   A subcommittee today continued revising ``Christian Obedience in
a Nuclear Age,'' a paper that has been criticized by groups within
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) who say it improperly glorifies
civil disobedience and resistance to government policies.
   Abortion and nuclear weapons were among the controversial issues
being debated during the nine-day meeting of the 3-million-member
church's 200th General Assembly, which ends Wednesday.
   On Friday, full committees of the assembly adopted a
wide-ranging statement on religious freedom, including
recommendations that pastors give up their tax exemptions for their
housing allowances, and adopted a paper titled ``Is Christ
Divided?'' which complains that special interest groups have split
the denomination and calls for more serious theological discussion
of issues.
   A committee Friday called for a change in the church's position
on abortion and a new study of the issue, but supporters of the
denomination's generally pro-choice position say they expect a
floor fight on the question. The assembly is scheduled to consider
the matter on Tuesday.
   Presbyterians Pro-Life, a sanctioned organization within the
denomination, wants the church to condemn abortion in all instances
except where the mother's life is in danger.
   PPL co-sponsored an appearance by Nobel Peace laureate Mother
Teresa in a rally before the convention began Tuesday. PPL hoped
Mother Teresa's reputation and staunch anti-abortion stance would
persuade commissioners to approve a new study, or a change in
church policy.
   Currently, the Presbyterian group opposes abortion as a method
of birth control, but says the decision rests with a woman in
consultation with her doctor and her conscience.
   Also Friday, the 18-member Christian Obedience subcommittee
retained language in the Christian Obedience paper that calls
nuclear war immoral, but changed a section labeling the theory of
nuclear deterrence immoral.
   T. LaFontine ``Fountain'' Odom, an elder from Charlotte, N.C.,
said the subcommittee revised the paper to say ``nuclear deterrence
as an end in itself'' is immoral.
   In addition, the subcommittee deleted recommendations calling on
local church groups to provide financial and moral support to those
who resist the government through tax protest and civil
disobedience.
   But the subcommittee left in recommendations calling for
creation of a voluntary Fund for Obedience to a High Authority
``for the assistance of those who suffer financial loss or
difficulty as a result of acts of conscience.''
   Many conservatives have blamed the Christian Obedience paper and
past social policy statements for the denomination's membership
decline.
   There were 2,976,937 church members in 1987, a decline of
154,191 since 1983, when the denomination was formed from two
Presbyterian groups that had split during the Civil War. The
denomination is almost 14 times larger than the second-largest
group, the Presbyterian Church in America.

<HEAD>Mandatory Drug-Testing Proposed for Interstate Truck Drivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY FARAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Teamsters union official says
mandatory drug testing of interstate truck and bus drivers is
unreasonable and resembles a politically motivated ``witch hunt''
by federal highway safety officials.
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters ``will fight this all
the way,'' said R.V. Durham, the union's safety and health
director. The Teamsters represent 200,000 truckers nationwide.
   Durham responded Friday to a highway safety proposal by
Secretary of Transportation Jim Burnley for drug testing of up to 5
million drivers of interstate trucks, passenger buses and vehicles
hauling hazardous materials.
   ``We must act to identify those commercial drivers who abuse
drugs and get them off the roads,'' Burnley told a news conference
here. ``When one drugged truck or bus driver goes out on the road,
he not only puts the lives of many people in danger, he gives the
entire work force a bad reputation.''
   But Durham said Teamster drivers are the safest and most
responsible in the trucking industry and called the DOT proposal a
``witch hunt'' and ``a politically motivated move to beat up on
truck drivers.''
   Durham said that Teamster truckers were already subject to drug
testing as part of their biannual transportation department
physical exams, and also if there was probable suspicion of
substance abuse.
   ``Random testing is an unreasonable and unjustifiable violation
of a person's right to privacy. We believe government-mandated
random testing is unconstitutional,'' Durham said.
   Burnley's proposal was the latest in a series of department
efforts to make America's transportation network safer.
   In March, the drug testing program was proposed for the aviation
industry. In May, the railroad industry was targeted.
   There are no firm statistics to indicate how many of the
nation's truck drivers are drug abusers, he said. But he cited a
June 1987 test of 317 tractor-trailer drivers in Tennessee that
showed 15 percent of the drivers tested positive for marijuana,
cocaine and prescription stimulants.
   The proposed rule would cover 3 million to 5 million people who
drive commercial motor vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds,
vehicles that transport 16 or more people or vehicles that
transport hazardous materials.
   School bus drivers and intercity bus drivers would not be
affected by the proposal, he said.
   In Washington, the American Trucking Association endorsed the
effort but expressed concerns about how the tests would be
implemented.

   A group trying to take a convoy of
truckloads of aid to Nicaragua has again been stalled at the border
in a dispute with the Trreasury Department over trade restrictions
on the Central American nation.
   ``They have gone back on what they said,'' said David Silk, a
spokesman for Veterans' Peace Convoy. ``We are back to square one.''
   The group already is three days behind schedule.
   U.S. Customs officials met late Friday with representatives of
the group.
   ``Last night they told us we would be forced to sign a statement
of intent stating essentially that we the convoy are wrong, we are
guilty of breaking the embargo law,'' Sean Guillete, a convoy
participant, said early today. ``Our lawyers are not at all happy
with this proposal.''
   Donna de la Torre, a U.S. Customs worker in Houton, told KTSA
radio in San Antonio the meeting was held to pass out papers to be
signed and go over guidelines.
   About 100 convoy members have been camped here since Wednesday
when Treasury Department officials informed them that the trip
would violate trade restrictions imposed on Nicaragua in 1985.
Violation of the regulations can result in fines of up to $50,000
and prison terms up to 10 years.
   Some 30 tons of food, clothing and medical supplies would be
allowed for humanitarian purposes, the government told the convoy
members, but their 37 vehicles could not be left in Nicaragua.
   Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said the group would
have to apply for an export license, post cash bonds equal to the
value of the trucks, cars and buses, and give assurance the
vehicles would be returned to this country within 30 days.
   On Friday, Customs officials told the group they would not seize
their trucks if bonds were not posted.
   However, a Treasury spokesman in Washington said Friday
afternoon that Foreign Assets Control had not changed its position.
   Organizer Gerry Condon said the group planned to leave vehicles
in Nicaragua, but never intended to be out of compliance with the
law.
   The convoy began May 21 from different regions of the United
States and arrived in Laredo on Tuesday.
   ``We have baby food going bad in the 115-degree temperature down
here,'' Silk said. ``We are angry, tired of being toyed with.''
   Gullette said the group ``will do everything to avoid violence,
but at the same time the convoy believes in civil disobedience when
appropriate.''
   Convoy members say they are being harassed because of their
opposition to U.S. aid for the rebels fighting the leftist
Sandinista government. Treasury officials say they are simply
following standard procedures.

   Former soldiers loyal to deposed
President Ferdinand Marcos ransacked a military armory today but
failed to free soldiers jailed for involvement in past coup
attempts, the military said.
   Also today, the military said it filed murder and kidnapping
charges against a Swede, a West German and a Filipino of German
descent who were accused of taking part in a rebel raid in February.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
said the former soldiers fled with 24 stolen M-16 rifles when
guards fired at them as they tried to free some of the 160 people,
mostly soldiers, detained at suburban Camp Crame.
   He said his troops were ready for the attempted rescue of the
prisoners because of intelligence reports earlier that ``Marcos
loyalists'' would try to rescue Orlando Dulay, a former assemblyman
close to the former president, and other detainees.
   Dulay has been jailed for more than a year on charges of
masterminding the killing of several followers of President Corazon
Aquino during the campaign for the February 1986 presidential
election. Mrs. Aquino was swept into power and Marcos was deposed
during the campaign.
   The military, meanwhile, said charges were filed in a Quezon
civil court Friday against the Rev. Klaus Schmidt, 52, a West
German Protestant minister; Stellan Hermansson, 30, a Swede who
claims to be a free-lance journalist; and Antonio Bosch, a Filipino
businessman of German descent.
   The three, arrested Wednesday, were accused of taking part in a
raid by communist New People's Army guerrillas on a town southeast
of Manila in February in which two people were killed and two
soldiers abducted.
   Montano linked participants in today's raid on Camp Crame to
Reynaldo Cabauatan, a pro-Marcos former major involved in a failed
coup attempt in January 1987. Montano based the conclusion on the
attire of the raiders, who wore black hoods, fatigue pants, black
t-shirts with ``Black Forest Commando'' insignias and red arm bands.
   Military units were placed on alert throughout the nation today
but officials said the move was not related to the Camp Crame
incident. They said it was a routine measure to prevent any
disruption of celebrations on Sunday _the 90th anniversary of the
declaration of Philippine independence from Spain.
   Constabulary spokesman Lt. Col. Cris Maralit said the Camp Crame
raid began at 4 a.m. with the renegades riding in a white van and a
car that apparently were parked inside the camp the day before.
   It was not clear whether the raiders stayed overnight inside the
camp, the constabulary's national headquarters. Maralit said most
likely they slipped in one by one during the night.
   He said the renegades first ransacked the armory of the
constabulary's brass band and proceeded to the jail compound where
they were spotted by sentries who fired on them.
   The renegades immediately withdrew and were engaged in a brief
firefight by soldiers near the camp's gym, Maralit said.
   He said an undetermined number of renegades were believed hit in
the exchange. There were no casualties on the government side.
   Maralit said one soldier stationed at the raided armory was
being questioned for possible links to the raiders.
   At least 34 detainees at Camp Crame are accused of involvement
in at least five coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Soldiers linked with Cabauatan, who remains at large since the
Jan. 27, 1987 failed coup, also attempted to free soldiers jailed
at suburban Fort Bonifacio, the Philippine Army headquarters, in
April 1987.
   One of the renegades was killed in the incident and the others
surrendered after an eight-hour siege. At least 17 inmates, also
facing coup charges, escaped but eventually surrendered or were
recaptured.

   Search teams found the body of the
last man missing after an explosion in a coal mine, bringing the
total number of confirmed dead to 51, officials said today.
   The teams found the body late Friday, according to Peter-Carl
Ruehland, a spokesman for the Preussen Elektra company, which owns
the mine.
   On June 1, a powerful methane gas explosion ripped through the
Stolzenbach mine in Borken, located about 70 miles northeast of
Frankfurt.
   A total of 57 men were trapped in the mine after the blast,
which was West Germany's worst mine accident in over two 26 years.
Six miners were rescued June 4 after spending 65 hours trapped 500
feet underground.
   A local prosecutor has opened an investigation into the
explosion, reportedly to see whether a cigarette lighter flame may
have touched off the blast. Mine officials have said smoking was
strictly forbidden underground.

   Highway patrol and sheriff's officers
today searched for dozens of children who fled a Baptist boarding
home after a judge granted the state temporary custody following
allegations of mental and physical abuse.
   About 80 of approximately 140 children living at the Bethel Home
for Children in Lucedale remained at large, police said late Friday.
   State officials said they would work over the weekend trying to
reach the children's parents and guardians.
   Youth Court Judge Robert Oswald of Pascagoula issued the order
at 11 a.m. Friday, saying there was probable cause to suspect
physical and mental abuse at the home. Minutes after he issued the
order, Welfare Department personnel arrived at the home. But in the
meantime, the youths apparently were alerted and most had fled.
   ``We were told they were allowed, if not encouraged, to leave
the campus, and some of the children said they were told to run,''
said state Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain.
   Some of the children, ages 8 through 17, were found in private
homes, restaurants and walking along the streets of Lucedale,
Brittain said.
   About 60 children were taken to dormitories on the campus of the
Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield, he said. They were
undergoing physical examinations.
   After the decision was made to house the children at the
hospital, parents began calling the hospital, state hospital
spokeswoman Wynona Winfield said. Welfare Department social
workers, she said, told parents how to get to the hospital, how the
children were and answered other questions.
   Many of the youths were angry as they were taken into custody.
   ``You have no right, I want to be here with my people,'' said
Eric Parker, 16. ``I don't want to be here with all the rest of you
people who hate the truth. You better check yourself and make sure
you are not burning on the way to hell.''
   Officials were unsure how many children lived at the home
because its operator, the Rev. Herman Fountain, refused to provide
a list of residents, Brittain said.
   Fountain, along with several other ministers from the
fundamentalist church who flocked from Louisiana, Georgia and Texas
to support him, claim such boarding homes are protected from state
regulation because of the constitutional separation of church and
state.
   Oswald issued the order following a weeklong hearing on a
request by George County authorities. The hearing stemmed from an
investigation into a child who ran away from the home and refused
to return, claiming he was physically abused.
   In court papers, the youth, identified only by his initials,
said he was ``tired of being locked up, slapped and getting licks
all the time.'' He told social workers he was denied medical and
dental treatment during his 19-month stay at the Bethel home.
   Authorities have not charged anyone at the home with abuse but
are still investigating the allegations, Brittain said. Telephone
calls to the Bethel home were not answered late Friday.
   The judge ruled that according to Mississippi's Youth Act, the
children were being held in a detention home rather than a boarding
home. Detention facilities are required to notify the state of
children placed in their custody.
   Fountain was jailed for two days for refusing provide a list of
residents. But he was freed Friday without turning over the roster
after agreeing to an orderly transfer of the children to state
custody.
   When Welfare Department officials arrived, Fountain was already
at the home, Brittain said.
   ``We did not encounter any cooperation from him there. In fact,
it was just the opposite,'' Brittain said, declining to elaborate.
   Brittain said he was unsure whether any action would be taken
against Fountain.
   The court order gives the state 48-hour temporary custody of the
children, in addition to custody today and Sunday. Welfare
officials hope to locate and return the children to their parents,
Brittain said.
   ``We have information that some folks are trying to help the
kids escape out of state,'' he said.
   Based on his experience with the Bethesda Home for Girls near
Hattiesburg, where about 100 children were taken into state custody
in 1986, Brittain said he believed the children's parents would be
scattered throughout the country.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people filed past the
coffin of Josep Tarradellas today in a final salute to one of the
few remaining figures of the ill-fated 1931-1939 Spanish Second
Republic.
   Tarradellas, who became the first head of the restored
Catalonian regional government in the post-Franco era, died Friday
in this northeastern Mediterranean city from complications of a
chronic lung ailment. He was 89.
   Spanish National Radio said by midmorning police estimated 3,000
people had filed past Tarradellas' glass-covered coffin draped with
the red-and-gold-barred flag of the autonomous region of Catalonia.
Tarradellas lay in state in the Palace of the Generalitat, the seat
of the regional government.
   The regional government declared three days of mourning for
Tarradellas, one of the founders of the Republican Left Party of
Catalonia in 1931.
   A government spokesman said a funeral Mass would be held Sunday
in Barcelona with burial later that day in nearby Santa Coloma de
Cervello, his hometown.
   Tarradellas served as a minister of the regional government of
Catalonia during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. He went into exile
when the rebel forces of Gen. Francisco Franco defeated troops
loyal to the Second Republic.
   When Tarradellas left Spain he vowed never to set foot in his
native region again until Catalonian autonomy was restored.
   As the Spanish transition to democracy began upon Franco's death
in 1975, he sought to restore the autonomous government of the
four-province northeastern region of Catalonia.
   King Juan Carlos appointed Tarradellas provisional head of the
Catalonian government and he returned to Barcelona Oct. 23, 1977,
where huge crowds were on hand to welcome him home.
   Tarradellas retired two years later and lived with his wife,
Antonia, who survives him.

   The early version of a Star Wars anti-missile
defense can't be deployed until at least 1998, and even then would
cost more and offer less protection than the administration admits,
a Democratic report issued by three senators said Saturday.
   President Reagan has been pushing for development of a ``phase
one'' version of the program, but it ``is not going to get off the
ground, either militarily or fiscally,'' the 110-page report said.
   The report was written by the majority staff of the Senate
Appropriations committee and was released by three members of the
panel, Sens. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas, and William Proxmire of Wisconsin.
   It was the second major criticism in the past five days from
Capitol Hill of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars
is formally known.
   Last Tuesday, the Office of Technology Assessment, an arm of
Congress, said the highly sophisticated computer software needed
for Star Wars might fail. The OTA report also said an American Star
Wars defense could easily be thwarted by the Soviets, and would
likely set off a new U.S.-Soviet space arms race.
   The senators' criticism focused on SDI's so-called phase one,
which involves construction of an early version of the system. Star
Wars researchers are looking at a variety of exotic technologies,
including lasers, to use as a missile defense, but phase one
envisions using existing, ground-based rockets and orbiting
``garages'' of space-based rockets to fire at attacking Soviet
nuclear weapons.
   The Pentagon told Congress last year that deployment of a phase
one system could begin by the mid-1990s, and would cost between $75
billion to $150 billion.
   But the senators' report disputed those estimates. ``A
significant phase one deployment cannot occur before 1998 at the
earliest, with a full operational capability after the turn of the
century,'' it said. Costs could be as high as $171 billion, and
could approach $750 billion when combined with a later, phase two
program, it said.
   In addition, the Senate report said, a phase one system would
intercept less than 16 percent of the expected Soviet nuclear
warheads.
   The senators noted that ongoing U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms control
talks are aimed at reducing each superpower's arsenal of long-range
weapons by 50 percent.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization said the Senate
report ``contains more misleading assertions than facts.''
   It specifically disputed the estimate that only 16 percent of
expected Soviet warheads could be intercepted. The SDI office said
the military estimates, while classified, are ``considerably
greater than 16 percent.''
   Of the 1998 target date, the SDI rebuttal said ``congressional
cuts to the SDI budget have slowed our progress ... We are working
within congressional budget constraints to achieve the means for
effective strategic defenses at the earliest possible moment.''
   The senators' report agreed with the OTA assessment that the
Soviets could easily counter the U.S. shield.
   The phase one system ``likely would be obsolete the day it is
deployed,'' the report said. ``Technical challenges and the
evolving Soviet threat will severely degrade its effectiveness.''
   The Pentagon is ``underestimating Soviet political and military
resolve (to counter the U.S. defense) and overestimating the
difficulty of Soviet countermeasures,'' the Senate document said.
   The report called for overhauling the SDI program to emphasize
research into promising new technologies, rather than development
of existing systems.
   It noted that ``while the president's vision of SDI would
substitute strategic defenses for nuclear deterrence, SDIO has yet
to describe any system, phase one or otherwise, that would effect
such a substitution. Phase one would only reinforce nuclear
deterrence.''
   It also suggested that ``unless Congress is prepared to
substantially incrase funding every year for SDI, there will not be
enough resources to carry out a phase one research program while
simultaneously funding an energetic effort for promising new
technologies.''
   The House and Senate are now trying to decide how much to spend
for Star Wars in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The current Star
Wars budget is $3.9 billion.
   Reagan sought $4.8 billion, but the Senate voted $4.6 billion
while the House approved $3.5 billion. A House-Senate conference
committee will decide a compromise figure.

   Biopsies have been taken of tumors found in
Pe-Pe, the father of Mexico City's giant panda family, the director
of the Mexico City zoo said.
   Maria Helena Hoyo, director of the Chapultepec Zoological
Garden, said in a telephone interview Friday that the biopsies were
taken Thursday to determine if the tumors are malignant.
   The results will not be known for at least three weeks, she said.
   She said doctors removed tissue from Pe-Pe's left armpit and
also from the groin area where inflammations of two glands were
detected. Experts from the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., helped
in the operation.
   Miss Hoyo said the 13-year-old panda ``is in good shape'' and
was eating.
   The tumors were found early this year.
   In March, Pe-Pe was reported as being lethargic, and his weight
had dropped to 249 pounds down his usual 275 to 285 pounds.
   China gave Pe-Pe and his mate, Ying-Ying, to Mexico in September
1975. They have produced four cubs through natural conception, the
largest such panda family outside China.

   Kenya's attorney general promised to
investigate why a motorist who refused to give a ride to a stranded
government official was jailed for three months, press reports said
Saturday.
   Justice Mathew Muli told officials of the Law Society of Kenya
during a meeting Friday he would study the background of the case,
Nairobi newspapers reported.
   The Law Society urged the attorney general to establish on what
judicial grounds Peter Makau, 36, a factory technician from
Nairobi, was jailed. A magistrate in the western town of Eldoret
sentenced Makau to three months in jail on Thursday for ``very
unsocial behavior.''
   Makau pleaded guilty to a charge of ``uttering words of defiance
and disobedience to a lawful authority.'' The authority was Yusuf
Haji, the highest-ranking government official of the Rift Valley
province.
   Makau was driving through Eldoret on Wednesday when Haji,
ceremonially clad in his official pith helmet and khaki uniform,
flagged him down. The commissioner's car had broken down, and he
was late for an official function.
   Makau refused to pick him up and said: ``Go and find a GK
(government of Kenya) vehicle. My car is not a government vehicle.''
   The commissioner reported Makau to police, and he was brought to
court.
   Magistrate Njuguna Kimani jailed the technician without giving
him the option of a fine and told him, ``Government officials
deserve respect. The accused lacked respect.''

<HEAD>West German Company To Pay Millions To Nazi Forced Labor Victims</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to ADD that other German companies have
made similar payments. Pickup 4th graf pvs, ``The announcement...''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daimler-Benz, the largest industrial
conglomerate in West Germany, will pay $11.7 million to victims of
Nazi forced labor programs and their families, Red Cross officials
announced.
   Daimler-Benz makes cars, buses and Mercedes-Benz luxury
automobiles, while its wide-ranging subsidiaries also include a
major aerospace manufacturer.
   Like other German companies during Adolf Hitler's Third Reich,
Daimler used forced laborers to fuel the Nazi war effort.
   With the payment, Daimler-Benz joins other major German
companies who have paid reparations to former forced laborers and
their families. In 1986, the giant Flick conglomerate paid $2.9
million to slave labor victims.
   Other West German firms, such as the giant Krupp concern, a
major weapons producer during World War II, also have paid
reparations.
   The announcement of Daimler's payments follows a lengthy study
the company commissioned to determine the extent to which forced
laborers worked in its plants nearly a half century ago.
   Thousands of workers died from ill-treatment or were murdered in
concentration camps if they were no longer able to work.
   The German Red Cross, in a telex statement to the news media on
Friday, said it expected to receive $2.9 million from the automaker
to distribute to forced labor victims in France, Belgium and the
Netherlands.
   The Red Cross, located in Bonn, said a total of $11.7 million
would be paid by Daimler-Benz to ``those affected and their family
members.''
   It was not immediately known who would receive the rest of the
money, but the Red Cross said in the telex to news media that the
donations were all intended for victims and their families living
outside West Germany.
   Daimler-Benz officials have scheduled a news conference for
Monday, at which they were expected to announce further details of
the payment plan. They declined to give details of the payment
program on Friday.

<HEAD>Close Presidential Race Likely As Dukakis Runs Strong In GOP
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis is off to a strong
start in California and other longtime Republican strongholds in
his race against Vice President George Bush, although a closely
contested presidential election seemed likely, according to an
Associated Press survey.
   The 50-state survey indicated widespread optimism among
Democrats that Dukakis can end eight years of Republican rule in
the White House. GOP officials in many states said the contest
shapes up as a tight one, but several said Bush could win easily if
he succeeds in his attempt to depict Dukakis as an heir to the
Democratic Party's liberal past.
   Dukakis leads in the polls in California and New Jersey, which
last voted Democratic in 1964, and is running even with Bush in the
polls in Utah, which gave President Reagan his largest majorities
in 1980 and 1984. One survey shows him running even in reliably
Republican Nebraska, and within striking distance in Texas and
Florida, key Southern states.
   ``I think it will be the closest presidential contest we've had
since 1976,'' said Tom Cole, the GOP state chairman in Oklahoma.
Oklahoma hasn't voted for a Democrat in a presidential campaign
since 1964, but Cole said, ``We don't have a candidate with Ronald
Reagan's unique popularity. That's not to knock George Bush. Nobody
else has got that kind of popularity either.''
   Said Democratic Chairwoman Karen Marchioro of Washington state,
``This is the best shot we've had in a long, long time.'' The last
time a Democrat carried her state in a presidential election was
1968.
   Republicans have won four of the last five presidential
elections, with Jimmy Carter's victory in 1976 the only exception.
   While Dukakis leads in nationwide puiblic opinion polls, there
is agreement that political fortunes in the five months until the
election will be influenced by factors such as selection of a vice
presidential running mate, campaign debates and the health of the
economy.
   Republicans believe that Dukakis' lead is a temporary result of
favorable publicity over the past several weeks generated by his
string of primary victories against Jesse Jackson.
   ``Nobody has laid a glove on Dukakis and he hasn't been burdened
with the traditional baggage a northern liberal carries with him,''
says South Carolina GOP party director Tom Denny. ``That's going to
change once the conventions are over. We haven't been able to start
hitting on him.''
   For now, Dukakis' double-digit lead nationally is reflected in
poll results around the country and optimism among Democratic
officials in states from Washington and Oregon to New Hampshire.
   _ He leads Bush by a double-digit margin in polls in California.
He is also viewed as the leader in both Washington, which last went
Democratic in 1968, and Oregon, which last voted that way in 1964.
   _ Polls in Utah and Nebraska indicate the two men are running
even. Neither state has backed a Democrat in a presidential race
since 1964, and GOP officials in both states express confidence
that won't change this time.
   _ Bush holds leads in polls in Texas and Florida, but Dukakis is
well within striking distance and officials in both parties say the
race could be influenced by vice presidential running mates. Bush
is perceived as running generally well across the South.
   ``I sense a strong base of support for Vice President Bush'' in
the South, says Steve French, political director of the Alabama
Republican Party. ``But Republicans in Alabama realize how close
this election can be.''
   Officials of both parties agree that the vice president also has
to contend with weaknesses in the Midwest that were exposed during
the primary season.
   ``If the election were held today, I think Michael Dukakis would
stand a good chance of winning Iowa,'' where a Democrat last won in
1964, said the state's GOP chairman, Michael Mahaffey.
   As is often the case, the large industrial states _ Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio among them _ are viewed as key battleground states,
although Dukakis seems to hold the early advantage in each of them.
No matter what the polls show, California's 47 Electoral College
votes make it certain to be the biggest battleground of all.
   Most officials believe Dukakis holds an advantage in New York,
the second largest state with 36 electoral votes. In Pennsylvania,
GOP Chairman Earl Baker said Dukakis is ``the strongest Democratic
candidate'' to run in the state. Dukakis's base also gives him a
good shot at Connecticut as well as Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
and Democratic officials say the three Northern New England states
shape up as closer than usual.
   ``No matter what the polls look like this is going to be a close
election because the vice president has an advantage in the
Electoral College,'' says Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager. He
says that in states in the South and West there are ``210 or 220
(electoral college votes) easily available for the vice president.
... The problem is the other 50 are going to be difficult.''
   Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications director, says the Democrat
intends to stage raids in normally secure Republican territory.
``We can win electoral votes in every region of the country,'' he
says.
   It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency.
   The race could be heavily influenced by the vice presidential
selections.
   The AP survey, which relied on polls and contacts with party
leaders or independent political analysts in all 50 states, turned
up little enthusiasm for Jesse Jackson on the Democratic ticket, in
keeping with polls that indicate that such a pick would lose
support.
   But Dukakis received plenty of advice to look to a Southerner
such as Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, a Westerner or perhaps Ohio Sen.
John Glenn to fill out his ticket.
   ``If Dukakis doesn't pick a Southerner, it just makes it that
more difficult for us,'' said Texas Democratic chairman Bob Slagle.
   On the Republican side, the name of California Gov. George
Deukmejian came up frequently as talk turned to holding his state
in the GOP column. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander also was
mentioned by several as a good Southern choice.
   Whatever the preferences, the polls indicate the importance of a
vice presidential selection.
   A survey in Texas gives Bush a margin of 48 percent to 41
percent over Dukakis. But if Texas Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
were to join the ticket, the survey shows the race would narrow to
essentially even.
   Similarly, a recent poll in California gives Dukakis a lead of
53 percent to 40 percent over Bush. But the vice president would
fare far better if Deukmejian joins the ticket.

<HEAD>Agency Would Ease Tax Strain for Some Government Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency, seeking to make high-level
government service more attractive, is recommending some officials
be permitted to postpone taxes on profits resulting from property
sold to avoid a conflict of interest with their public duties.
   The Administrative Conference of the United States, meeting
Thursday and Friday, proposed the deferral of tax liability in
cases where the incoming official re-invests the proceeds of the
sale in mutual funds. Congress would have to change the tax laws to
permit this.
   The conference, a permanent independent agency established by
Congress to improve the working of federal agencies, proposed that
the tax postponement be available only in cases specifically
requested by the president.
   Under current law, officials who are forced to sell off property
because they might present conflicts of interest, must pay any
capital gains taxes during the year of the sale.
   ``You shouldn't have a tax penalty to become a public servant,''
said Fred J. Fielding, a former Reagan White House counsel who
chairs the conference's special committee on ethics in government.
   The conference also recommended that President Reagan sign an
executive order that later this year would require members of the
incoming president's transition team to agree in writing to a code
of conduct.
   During the 1980-1981 presidential transition ``over 600 persons,
most serving as volunteers, had active assignments on agency
transition teams,'' the group said.
   While it has no knowledge of any abuse, the group said, so many
people dealing with federal agencies ``offers the potential for
conflicts of interest or abuse of the public trust that accompanies
their special access to government information and facilities.''
   The proposed conduct code for transition employees, most of whom
are not paid and do not join the government, would prohibit them
from using, disclosing or permitting others to use for private gain
any information they obtained in their temporary roles.

   The catastrophic-care bill awaiting President
Reagan's signature will mean the biggest expansion of a federal
health program in a quarter century but carries a less-welcome
surprise for millions of elderly Americans: a big income tax
increase.
   For many Medicare recipients, the increase would more than wipe
out the gain won when the tax system was overhauled in 1986.
   The tax increase would kick in for 1989 income for anyone who is
eligible for Medicare. It would start by adding 15 percent to
regular tax next year, jump to 25 percent in 1990 and then rise by
as much as one percentage point a year thereafter, conceivably
reaching 35 percent by the end of the century.
   This tax increase would pay for about two-thirds of the cost of
protecting Medicare recipients against catastrophic hospital,
physician and drug expenses; the program would cost an estimated
$33 billion over the next five years alone. The remainder of the
cost would be covered by raising the monthly Part B premium paid by
recipients for doctors' services.
   Thus, those who benefit from the expanded program would pay the
entire cost _ at least for the near future. ``We have not asked our
children to pay the medical bills that we incur,'' said Rep. J.J.
Pickle, D-Texas. ``These benefits will be paid for by the men and
women who will use the coverage.''
   But even some members of Congress who voted for the bill worried
aloud that as the tax burden on the elderly grows, pressure will
mount to have other taxpayers share the cost.
   The compromise bill cleared by Congress last week is
considerably more generous than the version recommended by Reagan.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that the president will veto
it, even with the tax increase.
   Sponsors of the bill are reluctant to use the term ``tax
increase.'' Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, repeatedly referred to it as ``a new
income-related premium.''
   Negotiators who wrote the final version of the bill decided that
paying for the expansion solely by raising the Part B premium would
have made it prohibitively expensive for lower-income people.
   The final compromise, said Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., ``takes into
consideration an individual's ability to pay for this protection
and in doing so allows this coverage to be more affordable for
low-income beneficiaries.''
   Congress estimates the average tax increase will be $285 per
person in 1989 and $506 in 1993.
   The bill includes several restrictions on how the tax would be
applied:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _It would hit only those people eligible for Medicare (generally
age 65 or older or disabled) whose incomes are high enough that
they already pay at least $150 income tax. Typically and elderly
couple with adjusted gross income of $11,000 or less would not be
subject to the increase.
   Congressional staffers estimate that in 1989, about 40 percent
of Americans over the age of 65 would have to pay the tax increase.
A private organization, the Institute for Research on the Economics
of Taxation, estimates 46 percent next year and 56 percent by 1993.
   _The maximum tax would be $800 per person in 1989 ($1,600 for a
couple if both spouses are eligible for Medicare), rising to $1,050
($2,100 per couple) in 1993.
   _The tax will be at a rate of $22.50 for each $150 of regular
income-tax liability in 1989; by 1993, $42 per $150 of liability.
   According to the Institute for Research, a couple with $21,000
adjusted gross income and taking the standard deduction would face
a tax increase of $236 in 1989 and $441 in 1993. At $31,500 income,
the increase would be $473 next year and $882 in 1993.
   On the average, taxpayers with incomes between $20,000 and
$30,000 were given a $220 tax cut in the 1986 tax overhaul; those
between $30,000 and $40,000 averaged $273.
   The increase in the monthly Part B premium required by the bill
would be the same regardless of income. In 1989, the $27.10 premium
would rise to $31.10, and by 1993 would be $42.60 a month.
   Backers of the bill acknowledge that no more than 7 percent of
the elderly and disabled who are eligible for Medicare would
benefit from the bill, even though all will have to pay the Part B
increase and many will face the new tax.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee,
compared the bill to fire insurance.
   ``Not everybody is going to have a catastrophic illness and not
everybody wants to have a fire either,'' Bentsen said, ``but what
you are paying is an insurance premium that takes the law of
averages and applies it to the individual, with the fervent hope
that the vast majority never have the need to use this benefit.''

<HEAD>Ship Loaded with 10,000 Tons of Ash Reported on Way to Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ship that has been unable to unload its
10,000 tons of ash for 20 months is headed for West Africa, where
public anger is rising at industrial nations trying to dump wastes.
   The Khian Sea is en route to the Cape Verde Islands, and from
there it will go to an undisclosed destination in West Africa, said
its operator, the Amalgamated Shipping Co. of Freeport, the Bahamas.
   In a June 3 letter to the Environmental Protection Agency,
Amalgamated Shipping said the Khian Sea was proceeding ``under
reduced speed'' to the islands west of Senegal to await further
orders.
   The company said it had a representative in West Africa
negotiating for the discharge of the ash, which came from city
incinerators.
   The Organization of African Unity has called plans by developed
countries to dump their wastes ``a crime against Africa and
Africans,'' and the Greenpeace environmental group said in a report
last week that shipping waste to Africa was a growing trend.
   ``In particular, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America have
become the preferred dumping grounds of waste peddlers from
industrialized countries,'' Greenpeace said.
   On Thursday, Guinean officials announced that they had jailed a
Norwegian official and several Guinean employees of the Ministry of
Commerce for bringing 15,000 tons of Philadelphia ash into the
country.
   ``If the Khian Sea is planning to go to West Africa, if these
guys are thinking of marketing their material there, their timing
is way off,'' said Peter Christich, an official in the EPA's
international affairs office.
   The Khian Sea left Philadelphia in October 1986 loaded with
about 15,000 tons of incinerator ash. It has been rejected by the
Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Haiti and Guinea-Bissau.
It unloaded about 4,000 tons of ash in Haiti before being ordered
out of the country.
   It returned to the Delaware Bay on March 1 with the intention of
taking the ash back to Philadelphia. But negotiations broke down
with the contractor who was to dispose of the ash, Joseph Paolino &
Sons, and the ship left May 22.
   In March, A.S. Bulkhandling, Inc., a Norwegian shipping company,
said it had taken 15,000 tons of Philadelphia incinerator ash to
Guinea to be used in making construction material. The ash was
dumped on the island of Kassa, off the Guinean coast.
   By May, the Guinean government formally requested that the ash
be removed. Bulkhandling officials tried to convince the government
that the ash was not harmful, but it was not convinced and set a
May 20 deadline to remove the ash.
   The ash was not taken away, and on Thursday, the government
announced that Norway's consul general had been arrested for
complicity in the secret dumping of what it called 15,000 tons of
toxic waste from the United States.
   Ibrahima Sory Diaby, Guinean secretary of state for security,
said the waste was shipped from Philadelphia. City officials have
said that the ash is not harmful.

<HEAD>Candidates Long On Promises, Short On Specifics To Cut Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis both talk of
eliminating the U.S. budget deficit in four to five years, but
outside economists suggest their intentions may be better than
their arithmetic.
   Analysts not aligned with either camp suggest that plans
forwarded so far by both the Republican and the Democratic
nominees-to-be fall far short of pointing the way to a balanced
budget.
   ``It's the 1988 edition of voodoo economics,'' said economist
Michael K. Evans, using the term coined by Bush in 1980 to
criticize Ronald Reagan's ``supply-side'' contention that budget
savings could flow from tax cuts.
   The plans of both candidates contain as major elements features
that private economists find dubious: Dukakis' claim that he can
make a major dent in the deficit by simply beefing up
tax-collection enforcement, for example, or Bush's contention that
his election would cheer financial markets and drive down interest
rates by two percentage points, thus saving billions in interest
payments on the $2.5 trillion national debt.
   Both candidates say they'll put a high priority on trimming the
budget shortfall, which was $150 billion last year and a record
$221 billion the year before. Bush claims he can eliminate it in
one term. Dukakis generally speaks of closing the gap over five
years.
   Bush, who has long since shedded his reservations about Reagan's
economic policies, also is calling for a ``flexible freeze'' to
keep overall federal spending from growing faster than the rate of
inflation, with an exemption for Social Security benefits. Within
that freeze, some programs would rise and others would be cut.
   But Bush won't say what he would cut, and he hasn't been clear
on what he would increase, either, beyond suggesting that education
programs, AIDS research and drug enforcement would get more
attention under a Bush presidency.
   Bush has also proposed a long-range health plan and a
college-bond savings program, which together could cost the
government upwards of $500 million a year.
   He also proposed reducing the capital gains tax to 15 percent
from its current rate of 28 percent and disputes arguments by many
economists that it would cost the Treasury revenues.
   Bush also has repeated Reagan's long rebuffed calls for a
constitutional balanced-budget amendment and authority to veto
individual items in spending bills.
   The vice president, like Reagan before him, insists he would not
raise taxes. ``Absolutely not, period,'' he says.
   Dukakis says he won't rule out new taxes as a possibility but
has been vague on just how he'd trim the deficit. He says he'd like
to do it without new taxes.
   The Massachusetts governor says he hopes to reduce federal red
ink in annual installments of about $30 billion. He talks about
``hard choices'' on spending. But, like Bush, he won't say exactly
which programs he'd chop.
   Dukakis has suggested in general terms that he would cut defense
spending to help pay for elderly care.
   Dukakis also hopes to trim the deficit by stricter enforcement
of tax laws and with a program of amnesty for tax cheats, which he
suggests could save a total of $90 billion over a five-year period,
an amount private analysts suggest is wildly optimistic.
   Both candidates' hopes for wiping out the deficit are based on
rosy assumptions of continued economic growth.
   While both say they will not cut automatic Social Security
benefit increases, both are counting on an anticipated surplus in
the Social Security trust fund in the years ahead to help offset
red ink in other areas, at least on paper.
   Both candidates have been deliberately obscure when it comes to
additional details, particularly on spending reductions.
   ``Both of them are doing the right thing right now and that is
keeping their mouth shut,'' said Pat Choate, an economist with the
TRW Corp., who says that neither candidate yet has made serious
proposals to deal with the deficit.
   ``To bring our fiscal and monetary policies into balance
internally and with each other and with the rest of the world,
we're going to have to do some tough things in 1989 and 1990.''
   Spell those tough things t-a-x-e-s, adds Choate, who says
there's little likelihood that the budget can be brought close to
balance without new levies.
   ``To the degree that the presidential candidates and their aides
get out and get into the fight over specifics, every time they
bring up a specific and get into a fight over it, that's an option
they lose. It's a sad reality, but we're better off if they don't
say much,'' Choate said.
   William Dunkelberg, dean of the school of business at Temple
University in Philadelphia, said neither candidate has yet
presented a realistic deficit-reduction plan.
   ``There are only two ways to eliminate the deficit: one is to
cut spending, two is to raise taxes. Those are the only two ways,''
said Dunkelberg.
   ``But from a political point of view, you can't get elected by
telling people you're going to cut what they get from the
government by $150 billion or by telling them you're going to raise
taxes either.''
   Any effective program of cuts must pare deeply into so-called
entitlement programs, direct government payments to individuals.
   Democrats in the past have championed such programs. And Bush,
seeking to broaden his appeal to women, minority groups and
blue-collar workers, has recently been talking of giving more
attention to social programs such as child care, health care for
the elderly, education and training for dislocated workers.
   Dunkelberg said that of the two candidates, Bush's plan for a
freeze ``is a somewhat more concrete proposal,'' although not a new
idea, and probably not a concept that Congress would buy. Besides,
he said doubts that a freeze plus inflation alone would enable
revenues to catch up with spending.
   Bush's plan has an added element, revealed in recent sessions
with economic advisers. This is the assumption that financial
markets would react favorably to his spending-freeze proposal, and
send interest rates tumbling by at least two percentage points.
   Such a drop in interest rates would dramatically lower what the
government must pay in interest on the national debt, payments that
now are running at just over $200 billion a year.
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the Wefa Group, an economic
forecasting service based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., calls this idea
far-fetched. ``Why would the market respond favorably? That's
ridiculous. The market is not stupid. The market knows you can't
get to where you want to get to by taking taxes and Social Security
off the table.''

   Drought can mean strict water conservation measures for
townspeople, financial hardship for farmers and rising prices for
scarcer farm products, but it also has other effects on the world
around us:

   ``It'll be very tough times for wildlife of all kinds,'' says
University of California, Davis, wildlife specialist Lee Fitzhugh.
``Virtually anything that depends upon herbaceous plants and seeds
will suffer _ songbirds, amphibians, reptiles and some small
mammals.''
   Territorial disputes may increase as animals concentrate around
dwindling water supplies in late summer and fall, says Fitzhugh.
   Jim Vashro of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks
said fish in streams and rivers are forced to move to deeper holes
for protection.
   ``The fish are concentrated more, so the predation and food
competition goes up,'' he said. ``There's a larger mortality rate
and less oxygen. As the water temperatures go up, the oxygen needs
of the fish go up, and they become stressed, their growth rate is
slowed, or they die.''
   The dry weather could mean fewer ducks for the fall hunting
season.
   Gay Simpson of the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and
Parks said many nesting areas have dried up, although the extent of
the problem won't be fully known until after a breeding pair survey
and brood count are conducted.
   Around Atlanta coyotes, descendants of animals smuggled in by
hunters, have taken to raiding watermelon patches in search of
water, state wildlife officials say. Rats are reported invading
yards in the San Francisco Bay area in search of water.
   Even handouts for birds could be affected.
   ``Feed prices are way up already with the dry weather,'' said
Tom Westman, owner of several Minnesota Greenery Wild Bird Stores.
`In just the last month we've seen a 25 percent increase in our
costs on sunflower seeds. If some of these areas don't start
getting rain, then in the fall prices will continue to climb.''

   California Department of Forestry Director Jerry Partain says he
brought crews on early and added extra seasonal firefighters
because he fears the drought could fuel a firestorm exceeding the
ravages of the lightning-spawned blazes of 1987 that blackened
nearly a million acres. Large sections of forest may be closed to
the public because of fire danger.
   Drought-weakened trees are beginning to die under insect attack
in some areas.

   ``I've got eight boat slips out of 60 I can't use because
they're out of the water,'' said Mike Williams, president of the
International Falls (Minn.) Chamber of Commerce and co-owner of
Thunderbird Lodge on Rainy Lake on the Canadian border.
   Lake Tahoe, on the Nevada-California state line, is fed by
snowmelt in the Sierras, but there was little snow last winter. Now
at least two public boat ramps can't be used because of the falling
water level.
   Gary Midkiff, assistant director of the Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency, also said the low water is harming the lake's delicate
water quality. He says the falling water level lets sunlight warm
the lake deeper than usual, encouraging the growth of algae.

   There's no work waiting for hundreds of migrant workers who
journey north to Minnesota's Red River Valley every year to thin
and weed sugar beets.
   Growers replanted 150,000 acres of sugar beet plants after a
killing frost, but the new seedlings can't take root in the dry
soil and are blown about like tumbleweeds.
   Between 200 and 300 migrant farm workers have added their names
to a waiting list for temporary work at the Minnesota Jobs and
Training office in Polk County, said Armando Cuellar, a migrant
labor counselor at the office.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Offers Upbeat Assessment of Economic Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, in an
upbeat assessment of the upcoming seven-nation economic summit in
Toronto, said that the world economy is in better shape now than it
has been for any of President Reagan's previous seven summits.
   Because U.S. officials don't want to upset financial markets in
the midst of a presidential election campaign and because U.S.
allies would prefer to wait and deal with Reagan's successor, few
new policy initiatives are expected during the session.
   In an interview late last week, Baker also said that he won't
let widespread reports that he's about to leave his post to join
George Bush's Republican presidential campaign distract him from
giving his full attention to the economy.
   The Treasury secretary said there was ``no chance'' that any
decision would be made in the coming week before the summit.
Republican sources have said they expect Baker to resign sometime
this summer to help run Bush's campaign.
   The economic summit, the 14th in as many years, provides a forum
for the leaders of the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada to map out strategies to promote world
growth.
   But because the world economy is doing surprisingly well at
present, world leaders see no reason to launch any grand new
initiatives at the three-day meeting, which begins June 19.
   Economic growth has accelerated, stubborn trade imbalances have
finally begun to narrow and the dollar, after a dizzying,
three-year plunge, has stabilized.
   ``I think the world economy is in the best shape that it has
been in going into any of the eight economic summits that I have
attended with President Reagan,'' Baker said at the end of last
week during a relaxed interview in his office.
   Baker, considered one of the president's savviest political
strategists, served for four years as White House chief of staff
before taking the Treasury job in early 1985.
   He said that the drive he began in September 1985 for closer
international economic coordination among the summit countries,
known as the Group of Seven, had helped the major industrialized
countries withstand the shock from last October's stock market
collapse.
   ``The Group of Seven countries in the aftermath of that event
refused to turn inward. They continued to cooperate closely ... to
spend an extraordinary amount of time conferring by telephone, with
the result that some rather major remedial actions were taken,''
Baker said.
   He said that interest rate reductions in Europe, trade
adjustments in Japan and the two-year federal deficit reduction
pact reached last December in the United States had all helped to
calm financial market jitters and set the stage for accelerating
growth.
   ``We have a coordination process which has been tested by the
adversity of the stock market crash,'' he said. ``I think the
markets are becoming convinced that the G-7 is unified and that we
are acting in a coordinated and cooperative way.''
   Baker said this renewed confidence had led to an increase in
foreign private investment in the United States this year. In 1987,
the flow of private funds, which had been helping to finance the
federal budget deficit, almost dried up.
   Foreign central banks filled in the gap, but Baker said there
was evidence that the amount of central bank purchases of U.S. debt
had fallen to roughly one-fourth of what it was a year ago.
   The administration is hoping to use Reagan's farewell summit to
spotlight some of the president's favorite themes, including the
need to cut tax rates and eliminate government regulations to spur
free market enterprises.
   ``This summit hopefully will recognize the contribution the
Reagan-Bush administration's policies have made to world growth,
policies which were derided when they were first proposed at the
initial summit in 1981,'' Baker said. ``Most of the major countries
are now moving wholeheartedly toward free-market economic policies
such as deregulation, privatization and tax reform.''
   Baker is a close friend and adviser of Bush, and Republican
sources have said that the administration is already reviewing a
short list of possible successors. Nicholas Brady, a Wall Street
investment banker who is also a close confidant of Bush, has
emerged as a leading candidate to succeed Baker.
   Right before last year's economic summit in Venice, the
administration made a surprise announcement that Alan Greenspan
would be replacing Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and there
had been speculation that Baker's resignation and replacement would
similarly be announced before the Toronto summit.
   But Baker flatly rejected that scenario and turned aside all
efforts to gauge when he might leave his Treasury job to join the
Bush campaign.
   ``I am not going to sit here and speculate with you on something
that may never happen,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Radical students hurling firebombs
stormed a major government building Saturday and grappled with riot
police after security forces blocked a reunification march to the
North Korean border.
   Police said 26 students forced their way past guards at the huge
Combined Central Government Complex in the center of Seoul, which
houses the prime minister's office, the foreign ministry and other
major government offices.
   Students smashed windows and damaged a police post and a waiting
room in the complex with firebombs, police said. The complex is
across a main road from the U.S. Embassy.
   Eight attackers barricaded themselves in a third-floor cafeteria
in one building and hurled firebombs at riot police before being
seized.
   No injuries were reported. Police said 18 students were arrested.
   ``Punish the Roh Tae-woo government!'' and ``Fight for
unification!'' the attackers screamed.
   The students have accused President Roh Tae-woo of repressive
and undemocratic tactics aimed at keeping South Korea separate from
the communist North and allied with the United States.
   The students launched the raid after the government on Friday
blocked their plans to march to the North Korean border for talks
with northern student delegates on reuniting the Korean Peninsula.
   North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said students
rallied Saturday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to
denounce the suppression of the march. The report, monitored in
Tokyo, gave no attendance figures.
   It said Ko Ung Sam, head of the North's student delegation to
the planned border talks, vowed to continue a ``persistent
struggle'' for the meeting.
   South Korean riot police firing tear gas battled students
hurling firebombs and rocks in fierce street clashes Friday after
the government blocked radicals' attempts to march the 30 miles to
the border.
   Police said Saturday that more than 800 students were arrested
in the clashes and more than 100 police and students were injured.
   Radical leaders at a rally Saturday at Yonsei University in
Seoul vowed to mount another march to the North Korean border on
Aug. 15, the national independence day. They said they would not
stop their struggle for reunification of the peninsula, divided
since 1945.
   ``Our struggle has ignited the mind of the people who want
reunification of our land,'' one leader said in a speech.
   About 2,000 students applauded the speakers and shouted slogans.
But the students' mood was subdued, and thousands of others who had
gathered at the campus for the march Friday left during the night.
   Speakers continued to denounce the United States and demand the
withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact.
   ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Reunification!'' they chanted.
   Radicals claim the United States enforces partition of the
Korean Peninsula so it can rule the South. A wave of violent
anti-American protests has hit South Korea during the past month.
   Small clashes denouncing the blocking of the march were reported
in the provincial cities of Taeju and Kwangju. Riot police firing
volleys of tear gas dispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs.
   The hard-core radicals _ who are often joined in protests by
more moderate sympathizers _ represent no more than about 10
percent of South Korean college students and have failed to attract
wide popular support with their reunification campaign.
   Most South Koreans fear the totalitarian North is determined to
conquer the South. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start
the Korean War and the two nations remain bitter enemies.
   Roh, who took office Feb. 25 after elections in December, has
liberalized debate on unification but said the government, not
students, should lead any dialogue with North Korea.
   A funeral was planned Sunday in Seoul for a radical student who
died June 6 after setting himself on fire in a ritual protest.
Three students have killed themselves in protests since May 15. In
South Korea, dissidents sometimes use suicide as a way to call
attention to their demands.

   Iranian gunboats today attacked and set
ablaze a British-flagged tanker off Saudi Arabia and fired
rocket-propelled grenades at an American-chartered freighter in the
Strait of Hormuz, sources said.
   The raid on the freighter left one crewman dead and two injured.
   The British-flagged tanker, the 258,979-ton Esso Demetia, was
set ablaze at 6:05 p.m. southeast of the Saudi oil port of Ras
Tanura, according to gulf-based shipping executives, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   It was not known if the attack by two Iranian gunboats or the
resulting fire caused casualties aboard the Esso Demetia.
   Four hours earlier, two Iranian gunboats attacked the 11,744-ton
West German vessel Dhaulagiri 300 miles to the south as it sailed
into Hormuz, the waterway connecting the Persian Gulf and the Gulf
of Oman.
   The freighter was manned by a crew of five Germans and 14
Filipinos, the sources said. The seaman who was killed took a
direct hit, but it was not known whether it was from a grenade or
machine-gun fire, they said. Two crewmen were injured by shrapnel
from the rocket-propelled grenades, the executives said.
   A man with a Filipino accent was heard radioing from the
freighter for assistance. ``He was begging, almost crying for
helicopter assistance to remove the wounded,'' said one executive
who monitored the radio call.
   An Omani patrol boat later carried the injured to a hospital,
they said.
   The executives said the freighter was punctured with holes, but
no fire broke out. It was heading for the Saudi Arabian port of
Dammam, they said. The vessel was chartered by the American
President Lines Ltd. of San Francisco, to carry containers of cargo
to Arab ports in the gulf.
   The freighter's engine was not damaged, and it was expected to
go to the southern gulf port of Dubai for repairs, the sources said.
   The Iranian attacks were their first in two weeks and the fifth
and sixth since May 3, when the U.S. Navy broadened its protective
role to non-U.S. flagged vessels in the gulf.
   On Thursday, Iraqi warplanes shattered a two-week lull in the
``tanker war'' by attacking a salvage tugboat, the 742-ton
Singapore-flag Salverve. The raid killed two seamen, shipping
officials reported.
   On Friday, Baghdad Radio reported another Iraqi air raid hit a
``large maritime target'' off the Iranian coast. But there has been
no independent confirmation of that raid.
   Iran and Iraq, at war since 1980, have attacked more than 500
merchant ships in the gulf since early 1984. More than 300 seamen
have been killed.

   Twenty-five years after he stood
face-to-face with George Wallace at the University of Alabama,
Nicholas Katzenbach returned to the campus to discuss Wallace's
vain attempt to keep the school segregated.
   Katzenbach, then an assistant U.S. attorney general in the
Kennedy administration, was sent to Tuscaloosa to enroll two black
students against the objections of Wallace, who was governor at the
time. A federal court had ordered the students' admission.
   ``At no time did we really know what Gov. Wallace would do,''
Katzenbach said Friday. ``It made us nervous.''
   Katzenbach, now a lawyer in New Jersey, was among 400
journalists, academics and university alumni who took part in a
three-day conference held to commemorate Wallace's 1963 ``stand in
the schoolhouse door.''
   Wallace, then serving the first of his four terms, had vowed
``segregation forever'' in his inaugural address, and had promised
he would physically prevent any attempt to register blacks at the
state university.
   But Wallace, after a long statement in defiance of the ``central
government,'' relented, allowing Vivan Malone and James Hood to
enroll.
   Wallace, who is wheelchair-bound as the result of an
assassination attempt and has made few public appearances since
leaving office last year, declined an invitation to attend the
conference. An aide, Elvin Stanton, said Wallace would not make a
statement about the anniversary.
   Wallace, who later changed his views on segregation, has said
that he made his stand largely to reduce the chances of violence
hitting the Tuscaloosa campus as it had at the University of
Mississippi earlier.

   Author A.E. Hotchner says the idea of
giving stock in actor Paul Newman's food business to people who
helped get it started was briefly discussed but people knew any
stock would be largely ``ceremonial.''
   Hotchner insisted that a delicatessen owner who says an attorney
for Newman promised him 8 percent of stock in the business was
never among those considered for the gift.
   Newman, Hotchner testified Friday, wanted all profits from his
Newman's Own Inc. to go to charity. The stock idea was eventually
abandoned in favor of Newman's holding all stock in the company.
   Westport delicatessen owner Julius Gold contends that he
contributed 30 months' effort to Newman's company and believed that
his ``judgment and perseverance ... led to the success of this
corporation.''
   Newman's Own, whose products include salad dressing, spaghetti
sauce, lemonade and popcorn, has donated $15 million to charity
since 1982 and helped create a camp for seriously ill children in
northeastern Connecticut. The camp opened last week.
   Hotchner, a close friend of Newman who helped the actor launch
Newman's Own in 1980, portrayed Gold as just one of many people
from whom he and Newman casually sought advice.
   The writer admitted, however, that Gold did introduce him to a
food distributor who eventually became the broker for the new salad
dressing. Gold is also suing the broker.
   Nwman, accompanied to court for the first time during the trial
by his wife, actress Joanne Woodward, also revealed that his will
specifies that all company profits will continue going to charity
after his death.

<HEAD>Report Says Students Criticizing American Radio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's official news agency said Saturday that
Beijing University students are accusing the U.S.-supported Voice
of America radio network of demagoguery in its reports on recent
student unrest.
   In Washington, the network denied the charge.
   The harshly worded report by the Xinhua News Agency said VOA,
which has a large audience in China, had become a target of student
criticism.
   Xinhua quoted one unidentified physics student as saying VOA had
blown the situation on the Beijing University campus out of
proportion.
   He said the radio reported falsely that a student was arrested
in a brief sit-in at Tiananmen Square last Wednesday. It said VOA
gave a false impression by saying police had charged students to
disperse them.
   Police on Wednesday closed off the square to thwart a planned
pro-democracy rally by students. About a dozen students tried to
stage a sit-in on a sidewalk off the square but police stopped
them. Police said one man was detained, but he was not a student.
   Richard Carlson, director of the U.S. broadcasting network, said
in a statement Saturday that ``the VOA rejects the charge of
demagoguery or anything resembling that.''
   Carlson said the network ``carefully sourced and verified the
events'' before reporting them. He said VOA will continue to
provide accurate information ``about events which affect them
daily, including calls for democracy and freedom.''
   The June 2 murder of a graduate student at the university
ignited campus protests first of lax security and later of poor
living conditions for intellectuals and the slow pace of democratic
reform in China.
   Dozens of posters, some criticizing the government, were put up
and 1,000 students have gathered on a campus square each night to
debate political issues and whether they should hold demonstrations.
   Xinhua quoted a student as saying VOA is overly interested in
bad news about China. ``Therefore, I suspect it has the desire to
see China plunged into chaos,'' the student said.
   A law student reportedly asked, ``Is the radio not trying to
make the situation worse?''
   China's official media have criticized VOA for its reports on
nationwide pro-democracy student demonstrations in December 1986
and January 1987. The network said its reports were balanced.
   VOA, which broadcasts in Chinese, English and 42 other
languages, is a major source of information for students trying to
find out what is happening on campuses throughout China.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's
weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from his official
retreat at Camp David:
   My fellow Americans, in one week, I go to Toronto for the annual
economic summit with the leaders of the major industrial
democracies. The United States, along with our strong allies _
Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and the
European Community _ form the industrial and technological backbone
of the free world.
   This will be my eighth and final economic summit, and there'll
be much to celebrate. Perhaps foremost will be the worldwide
economic revolution that has unleashed ever greater levels of
prosperity with lower tax rates. America led the way with major tax
cuts and tax reform, and the other major industrial democracies
have either cut their tax rates or are now in the process of doing
so.
   I'm proud to say that we now lead the world with the lowest top
personal tax rate of any of the major economic powers. We're also
leading the way in creating jobs, providing employment for a
greater percentage of our labor force than any of the other major
industrial democracies.
   In fact, U.S. employment is at its highest level ever, and we've
also brought down inflation and interest rates. It's not surprising
that country after country has followed us on the path to greater
economic freedom and begun to replace their statist policies with
deregulation, privatization and freer trade.
   One of the great lessons of the last seven years is that when
people in free economies are allowed to trade with one another
around the world, the result is greater prosperity for us all.
Certainly the United States has been one of the biggest gainers in
the global economy. You've probably heard that we're now in the
longest peacetime economic expansion in US history. But this is
also the first economic expansion in the post-war period in which
the US economy has grown faster than most of its major trading
partners.
   So, yes, we're doing particularly well. But when free countries
trade and invest with one another, there are no losers _ only
winners. Today we have a global economy in which the United States
is at the very center. Of total foreign direct investment in the
world, nearly 40 percent, by far the largest share, consists of
Americans investing overseas. But it's not a one-way street. At the
same time, the United States also receives more foreign investment
from abroad than any other country. So we truly are the investment
capital of the world.
   The same thing is true regarding trade. We import more and
export more than any other country on Earth. With that in mind, I
want to re-affirm my commitment to enactment this year of
responsible trade legislation. To help achieve positive trade
legislation, I've directed my senior advisors to stand ready to
assist the congressional leadership on a new trade bill, one that
will strengthen America's international competitiveness and create
even more new jobs for Americans.
   And make no mistake _ the global economy is the basis of our
prosperity and the foundation of our economic future. I can think
of no surer way of derailing our economy than to try, through
protectionist measures, to seal America off from trade and
investment with the other countries of the world.
   I'm reminded of the story of the Sunday school teacher who asks
her class who wants to go to heaven. Well, all of the children
raised their hands except for one little boy in the back of the
room. The teacher, astounded, says, ``Charlie, don't you want to go
to heaven?'' ``Sure, I do,'' he says, ``just not with this bunch.''
Well, fortunately, we and our trading partners are going to deal
with economic matters together, because that's the only way to move
ahead.
   I'm glad to say we're moving away from protectionism and toward
greater economic growth and job creation. One of the historic
events of our time is the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement that I
entered into this year with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. This
agreement between the world's two greatest trading partners will
eliminate tariff barriers between the United States and Canada by
the year 1999, and establish the largest free trade area on earth.
   The advantages to both our countries will be enormous in terms
of jobs and prosperity. But as much as this path-breaking agreement
does for the people of the United States and Canada, this
agreement, looked at in the sweep of history, is truly a gift to
the world. It creates a model that can be imitated and expanded,
and ultimately made universal among free nations. And that's
something we can truly be proud of.
   And finally, Tuesday is Flag Day, the anniversary of the first
official American flag. Nancy and I hope that you'll join us and
millions other Americans Tuesday evening at 7 o'clock, Eastern
Daylight Time, in the annual ``pause for the pledge.'' Until next
week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

<HEAD>U.S. Preparing To Remove Cruise Missiles From Italy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COMISO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Russians are coming, and the men and
women of the U.S. Air Force 487th Tactical Missile Wing are
preparing to show them what few Americans have seen _ 112 cruise
missiles.
   The missiles and their camouflaged launchers, positioned at this
base in remote southeastern Sicily, are stored under tons of earth
and concrete and surrounded by four rows of chain-link fence topped
with barbed wire.
   Soviet inspectors will arrive sometime after July 1 to count the
missiles and launchers to be eliminated under terms of the
superpower Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty, which went into
effect June 1.
   Lt. Col. Joseph Wagovich, a spokesman for the U.S. On-Site
Inspection Agency, told visiting reporters Friday that over the
next three years, the missiles and launchers will be sent to the
United States and destroyed under the eyes of Soviet inspectors.
   ``Exactly when they are going, or how they are going, I am not
at liberty to say,'' he said.
   Wagovich said the plan is to send the missiles to the Davis
Mathis Air Force Base in Arizona.
   U.S. inspectors will monitor the elimination of intermediate
range missiles in the Soviet Union, East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Wagovich said inspection agency officials are working quickly to
make sure everything is ready for the Soviets, who can make their
first visit between July 1 and the end of August.
   ``We have had a very short time to recruit and train inspectors
and escorts. It has been a very extensive effort. We have conducted
mock inspections, testing different scenarios,'' said Wagovich.
   Two Soviet reporters already have visited this high-security
base. They came Friday with other reporters from Italy, the United
States, Britain and France.
   Soviet and East-bloc journalists have also been shown missile
bases in Britain, West Germany and Belgium. Western reporters
visited a Soviet base in the northern republic of Ukraine on June 3.
   During the visit to Comiso, Capt. Don Sparks demonstrated how
the launchers are raised and prepared for action. But the Air Force
did not allow reporters to see a cruise missile.
   Each of the mobile launchers can fire four 21-foot missiles that
can deliver a 200-kiloton nuclear warhead 1,500 miles at almost the
speed of sound.
   The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945 had an
explosive force of 20 kilotons.
   Air Force officials, citing security reasons, declined to
discuss the number of warheads at Comiso or their total destructive
force.
   The Italian government agreed in 1982 to take the missiles, and
Comiso became the second base in Europe to accept cruise missiles.
The first were located at Greenham Common, England.
   Air Force officials estimate that the base _ a mostly treeless
379-acre expanse of asphalt, sun-baked earth and brown and beige
stucco buildings _ pumps $18.2 million a year into the local
economy.
   U.S. and Italian officials said no decision has been made on how
to use the base once the missiles have left or on what to do with
the 1,750 American and 179 Italian military personnel.
   Americans first came to this base 45 years ago.
   On July 11, 1943, American troops commanded by Lt. Gen. Omar
Bradley captured the Axis airfield after Allied bombers hammered
the base.
   Six days later, Allied fighter planes began to use the air base.

   Pakistan on Saturday denied
allegations that it is violating a U.N.-sponsored accord on the
Afghan war by aiding Afghan guerrillas.
   It also claimed that Afghanistan had made forays into its
airspace and territory.
   ``The allegations made by the Kabul side were rejected, and a
point by point reply has been handed over to the United Nations,''
said a Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Pakistani official said the reply ``emphasized ... that
Pakistan cannot be held responsible'' for guerrilla actions against
the Kabul government inside Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan is also not expected to prohibit the legitimate
political activity of the Afghan refugees who represent a
substantial segment of the Afghan population,'' the spokesman said.
   The United Nations sponsored an accord calling for withdrawal
from Afghanistan of the Soviet troops helping the Afghan government
in its 10-year-old war with anti-communist guerrillas.
   Pakistan, Afghanistan, United States and the Soviet Union signed
the accord in Geneva on April 14.
   Afghanistan repeatedly has charged that Pakistan is violating
the agreement, which took effect May 15, by continuing to arm
guerrillas. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made the
same charge at the United Nations on Friday and said the United
States, which supports the guerrillas, is partly to blame.
   In addition to the United States, China and Pakistan have armed
the guerrillas during their struggle to oust the Afghan government.
   Shevardnadze said as a result of the alleged violations, the
Soviet Union may be obliged to review the nine-month schedule to
withdraw its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan.
   The Pakistani spokesman also said there had been air and ground
violations of Pakistan territory by the Afghan government and
called this ``a serious breach'' of the Geneva accord. It did not
elaborate on the alleged intrusions.
   The Pakistani statement was given to the U.N. mission for
Afghanistan and Pakistan in Islamabad. The mission undertakes
inspections when it receives complaints of violations of the accord.
   It has offices in Islamabad and Kabul.
   Nearly 3 million Afghan refugees fled to Pakistan following the
Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in December 1979. The
bulk of the refugee population remains in Pakistan because of the
fighting.

   It's a simple toy conceived when a
stonemason watched a group of children playing with sticks, pencils
and empty thread spools. But since their introduction 75 years ago
Sunday, Tinkertoys have found their way into millions of toyboxes,
chemistry labs and even industrial drawing boards.
   ``It's a classic,'' said Debbie Wager, who oversees the annual
toy quality report from the liberal political action group
Americans for Democratic Action. ``There are not too many toys that
have been around for three or four years _ let alone 75.''
   Tinkertoys were introduced at the 1913 American Toy Fair by
inventor Charles Pajeau of Evanston, Ill., but it was a year before
they caught on.
   In a 1914 publicity stunt so successful it halted traffic while
motorists gawked, Pajeau hired midgets to dress up like Santa's
elves and play with Tinkertoys in a window of New York City's Grand
Central Station, according to ``A Toy is Born,'' by Marvin Kaye.
   Since then, more than 100 million Tinkertoy sets have found
their way to the young and young-at-heart.
   Chemistry professors use them to make molecular models, Indiana
Bell Telephone uses them to test management candidates and Lockheed
Corp. used them for design models.
   Still, ``it's the children who continue to make the toy
popular,'' said Wayne Charness, spokesman for Tinkertoy
manufacturer Hasbro Inc., of Pawtucket.
   ``It's a great toy because kids can use their imagination with
it and build anything they want,'' said Wager, of the
Washington-based lobby group. ``They can take it apart and build
something different with it 10 minutes later.''
   A youngster in 1913, 87-year-old Myrtle Green of North
Providence remembers playing with Tinkertoys when they were first
introduced.
   ``We used to make cars and houses and everything,'' she said.
   After watching her children and grandchildren grow up playing
with them, she says: ``It keeps the kids busy and they enjoy it. It
keeps them quiet.''
   While Mrs. Green and others may feel sentimental seeing their
offspring play with the familiar toy, nostalgia doesn't carry much
weight with today's youngsters.
   ``Little kids are pretty savvy,'' Charness said. ``If they have
done everything a toy has to offer the first few times they play
with it, it will stay in the toy box. But if you provide a toy
that's going to challenge them every time they use it, that's the
toy you're going to have to pick up after them every time they
play.''
   And what do children make with the multicolored wooden sticks
and spools?
   ``It could be nothing, it could be a helicopter, it could be the
Eiffel Tower,'' said Charness. Whatever it is, it ``gives them a
sense of accomplishment,'' he said.
   Tinkertoys haven't changed much over the years. First introduced
in metal canisters, they were sold in boxes for a time until last
year, when Hasbro returned to the original packaging, he said.
   In 1983, plastic pieces were added to allow for more
construction possibilities, said Charness.
   First marketed by The Toy Tinkers of Evanston, the toy changed
companies several times until 1986, when Hasbro acquired Tinkertoys
as part of a purchase of the New York-based CBS Toys and its
Playskool subsidiary.
   Sets of Tinkertoys come in four sizes, beginning at about $5.99,
Charness said.
   Imitators have developed over the years, but Tinkertoys continue
to hold their share of the market, selling about a million sets a
year, he said.
   Although new to the Tinkertoy tradition, the world's largest toy
maker celebrated Tinkertoys' 75th birthday last week with a
4-foot-high, multitiered birthday cake _ made of Tinkertoys.

   President Reagan said Saturday that he is
looking forward to the economic summit in Toronto and warned
Congress not to ``try through protectionist measures to seal
America off from trade and investment with the other countries of
the world.''
   In his weekly radio speech, delivered from the presidential
hideaway at Camp David in the western Maryland hills, Reagan
reiterated his pledge to work with Congress to reshape the trade
bill that he vetoed.
   The Senate sustained the president's veto on Wednesday.
   ``Make no mistake, the global economy is the basis of our
prosperity and the foundation of our economic future,'' the
president said. ``I can think of no surer way of derailing our
economy than to try through protectionist measures to seal America
off from trade and investment with the other countries of the
world.''
   But Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said in the Democrats'
response that the trade bill was needed ``to put our economic ship
of state back on course.''
   ``We can't continue to follow the course set by this
administration,'' Gephardt said. ``We've seen our position as the
world's largest creditor nation erode to that of the largest
debtor. We continue to run historic trade deficits.''
   ``The plain and painful fact is that without any incentive for
reciprocity, many of our trading partners are using our outdated
assumptions to take advantage of us,'' Gephardt said.
   The president will meet with leaders of Britain, Canada, France,
Italy, Japan, West Germany and the European Economic Community in
Toronto on June 19-21.
   ``This will be my eighth and final economic summit, and there
will be much to celebrate,'' he said.
   ``Perhaps foremost will be the worldwide economic revolution
that has unleashed ever greater levels of prosperity with lower tax
rates,'' he said.
   He said that America had led the way in tax cuts and
market-oriented economic policies and that the other industrialized
democracies had followed.
   ``It's not surprising that country after country has followed us
on the path to greater economic freedom and began to replace their
statist policies with deregulation, privatization and freer
trade,'' the president said.
   Reagan described the free trade agreement reached by the United
States and Canada last year as ``one of the historic events of our
time.'' The agreement is designed to eliminate trade barriers
between the two countries by the end of the century.
   ``This agreement, looked at in the sweep of history, is truly a
gift to the world,'' he said. ``It creates a model that can be
imitated and expanded and ultimately made universal among free
nations, and that's something we can truly be proud of.''
   Turning to his dealings with Congress, Reagan said, ``I want to
reaffirm my commitment to enactment this year of responsible trade
legislation.''
   ``To help achieve positive trade legislation, I have directed my
senior advisers to stand ready to assist the congressional
leadership on a new trade bill _ one that will strengthen America's
economic competitiveness and create even more new jobs for
Americans,'' he said.

   While six jurors decide a lung-cancer
victim's damage claims against three cigarette-makers, the defense
is gearing up its public relations engine.
   Each day the jury deliberated last week, a public relations firm
for two of the defendants reserved satellite time for a package of
background videotape, expert commentary, graphics on 30 years of
tobacco cases and live interviews with lawyers. The material is
intended for use on television stations.
   The federal lawsuit waged by Antonio Cipollone over the 1984
death of his wife, Rose, at 58 has drawn heavy media coverage, and
the tobacco companies have waged a major public relations offensive
throughout the 4{-month trial.
   The jury deliberated last week for four days, beginning Tuesday.
It took the weekend off and will return to the case Monday.
   Lorillard Inc., Liggett Group Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. are
accused of misleading the public about the dangers of cigarette
smoking through advertising, public relations and inadequate
research.
   Anti-smoking advocates have hailed the trial as a gold mine of
bad publicity for the $22 billion industry because of dozens of
confidential company documents presented as evidence.
   The documents spoke of a ``gentlemen's agreement'' not to
conduct cancer research, of an industry ``strategy'' to create
``doubt about the health charge without actually denying it,'' of a
research program designed ``so that (the) results can not harm''
the industry.
   The companies say the documents were taken out of context, that
Mrs. Cipollone freely chose to smoke knowing the risks and that
smoking is not a proven cancer cause.
   On hand almost every day for damage control during the trial
were five public relations experts, including three from the Daniel
J. Edelman Inc. firm, which represents Lorillard and Philip Morris
and arranged for the satellite feed. A lawyer also was present to
answer reporters' questions.
   After Liggett's attorney delivered closing arguments, a
spokesman at the courtroom door handed out a news release
containing the lawyer's statement.
   ``This is, by everyone's admission, the most critical case, the
one that attracted the most attention'' among tobacco liability
suits, said Edelman Senior Vice President John Scanlon.
   Philip Morris spokesman Tom Ricke said the satellite feed is
partly a solution to the large number of requests for interviews
from television stations.
   ``One of the problems we have is, win or lose, our side
historically hasn't gotten a lot of play, especially in the
electronic media,'' he said.
   The feed will include live interviews with tobacco trial
attorneys to discuss the legal issues and arguments, according to
an advisory sent to television stations. A Wall Street analyst on
tape will discuss the impact of the verdict on the tobacco
industry, and a legal expert will talk about the ``implications of
such suits for society.''
   Television stations also can receive footage of cigarette
production and of stacks of industry documents provided to
Cipollone's attorneys.
   Neither Scanlon nor Ricke would comment on the cost of the feed,
which is being produced by the business television division of
Visnews International, a TV news agency. A satellite company
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said reserving eight
hours of satellite time averages about $5,000, not including
production and distribution costs.

   A former governor fighting to defeat a
state lottery initiative for the second time in as many years has
picked up an unlikely ally _ representatives of the state's
multimillion-dollar gambling industry.
   ``They just happen to be on the same side that we've been on
since the proposal on lotteries has started,'' said Arthur Link, a
former congressman who was North Dakota governor from 1972 to 1980.
``I don't think it's ironic.''
   Lined up in opposition with Link, who opposes a state lottery as
a regressive tax on poorer citizens, are charities that are allowed
to run casino gambling in North Dakota.
   The proposal's primary backer predicts the measure will succeed
this year, helped by increased public awareness of flourishing
lotteries in neighboring South Dakota and Montana.
   ``Good God, we're the only one left,'' says Gorman King Sr., a
Mandan businessman who is spearheading the pro-lottery effort.
   Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia are operating
lotteries, and Wisconsin and Virginia are scheduled to start them
this summer. Voters in neighboring Minnesota are to decide in
November whether to allow one.
   North Dakota is the only state that has voted down a state-run
lottery.
   Voters will cast ballots in Tuesday's primary on whether to
approve a state lottery, which is now banned by the state
Constitution. The state's voters first rejected a lottery almost a
century ago, after gambling interests attempted to bribe the
Legislature into starting one.
   The constitution was changed recently to allow ``public-spirited
organizations'' to run gambling casinos, and more than 300 groups,
ranging from humane societies to American Legion posts, offer
bingo, blackjack and other games to benefit a variety of charities.
   North Dakotans spent $189.2 million on charitable gambling last
year, and once prizes, taxes and allowable expenses were deducted,
charities netted slightly more than $17 million in 1987, according
to the most recent attorney general's report.
   Critics contend a lottery would lure away the discretionary cash
North Dakotans now use for bingo and blackjack and thus hurt the
charities.
   ``It could have a direct effect on the organizations that are
trying to continue to fund their programs,'' said R.S. Guilderhus,
executive director of the Fargo-based Red River Human Services
Foundation.
   A lottery could conceivably drain away 70 to 80 percent of the
$500,000 in annual gambling proceeds his foundation now spends on
services, Gilderhus said.
   Winston Satran, director of the Home on the Range for Boys near
Sentinel Butte in extreme western North Dakota, said about 15
percent of the ranch's private donations come from fraternal
organizations that raise money from gambling.
   ``I think those (lottery) dollars would be diverted from what is
being spent on charitable gambling now,'' he said.
   King estimates a North Dakota lottery would gross $20 million
annually, with half of that sum returned to players as prizes. Of
the remainder, $7 million, or 35 percent, would go to the state
general fund; 10 percent would pay for lottery expenses; and 5
percent would go to vendors as commissions.
   ``It would be that much less that (the Legislature) would be in
your pocket for,'' King said of the projected $7 million in
proceeds. ``And it's a voluntary tax. It's up to you whether you
want to do it or not.''
   Link, a longtime friend of King, contends a lottery amounts to a
regressive tax on lower-income people and that its benefits would
be outweighed by its potential social costs.
   A lottery also represents a step beyond the existing charitable
gambling industry, said Link.
   ``This changes the role of government completely, in that it
puts the state government as the official promoter,'' Link said.
``The state ... is encouraging its own citizens to buy into a game
of chance where most of them have to lose. That's not the role of
state government.''

<HEAD>Automobiles' Success Its Undoing, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The automobile was once an efficient way to
get around but now causes such traffic woes and health hazards that
people must learn to use other transportation methods, said a study
released Saturday..
   ``Excessive reliance on cars can actually stifle rather than
advance societies,'' said the study by Worldwatch, a private
think-tank.
   The study estimated the number of passenger cars in use
worldwide grew from 53 million in 1950 to 386 million in 1986.
   As a result, motorists in hundreds of cities creep forward at
speeds slower than a bicycle's, the study said. It said that more
than 200,000 people died in 1985 in traffic accidents worldwide. In
the United States, some 30,000 people die each year of diseases
resulting from the use of gasoline and diesel fuel, the study said.
   ``It is time to build a bridge from an auto-centered society
into an alternative transportation future ... in which cars, buses,
rail systems, bicycles and walking all complement each other,'' the
study said.
   It said governments should discourage auto use where possible,
require cars be made more fuel efficient and less polluting, expand
public mass-transit systems and encourage affordable housing near
jobs.
   In the long run, moving urban patterns away from the sprawl
generated by the automobile is a solution, the study said.
   ``What people need is access to jobs, homes and services,'' the
study said. ``More compact and integrated communities can provide
such access without long commutes.''

   An amnesia victim who walked into a
pizza parlor six weeks ago and said ``Help me, I don't know who I
am,'' now faces a new identity crisis.
   ``I've gotten lots of calls saying I'm two entirely different
people,'' said the man, who dubbed himself John Jackson after he
was taken to a homeless shelter in Huntington.
   Jackson's ordeal began May 3, when he woke up beside railroad
tracks and Interstate 64 near where the borders of West Virginia,
Ohio and Kentucky meet.
   ``I woke up in a field and the first thing I thought was `It's
cold.' And then I wondered, `Where am I?' And then, `Who am I?'
Then I realized I had no answers and it got very frightening,''
Jackson said Friday.
   ``He remembers certain things about certain places, but he can't
remember his right name,'' said a volunteer at the Huntington City
Rescue Mission.
   ``He was bewildered more than anything else,'' said mission cook
Virginia Berry. ``He was dressed OK, had on blue jeans. He has a
beard, but it's well-trimmed and shaped and been taken care of. His
hair's that way, too.''
   The man asked the mission staff to call him Jackson because he
remembers roads and a baseball park in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Once, when asked to sign his name, he started to write the
letter P, ``and then I forgot. The only name right then I could
think of that started with a P was Paul, so maybe my first name is
Paul. I don't know,'' he said.
   He said he thinks he was born Jan. 1, 1948, which would make him
40, but doctors say he might be in his mid-30s.
   Berry said Jackson has occasional flashbacks, ``but they go so
fast he can't understand them.''
   He remembers military installations, such as Fort Huachuca in
southern Arizona. And he remembers places in Chicago.
   Mission workers asked Jacksonville newspapers to publish the
man's photograph, and on Friday he was inundated by calls from
people claiming to know him.
   Jackson did not recognize any of the callers, although some of
the details they provided matched the few pieces he has to his
puzzle.
   One group of people who saw Jackson's photograph told him they
believe he is Roy Moses, 33, who frequently vanished for months at
a time ``on a whim.''
   Moses' stepmother, stepsister and brother-in-law all talked to
Jackson on the telephone ``and they seem convinced that's who I
am.'' But Jackson said the family could provide few details, ``so
I'm not so sure.''
   Another Jacksonville resident said he recognized Jackson as
Michael Shawper, 40, a career Navy man. The caller knew several
little-known naval bases that Jackson remembers, ``and the
knowledge of history and geography, that matches. But he said the
last time he had seen Shawper was 11 years ago in Guam.''
   Shawper and Moses both attended the same college in
Jacksonville. One has been married two or three times, the other
once.
   ``So I'm either an educated responsible man or an educated
irresponsible man,'' Jackson said. ``I can't be both, that's for
sure. One of them has to be wrong. They both may be wrong.''
   He said he is being cautious until his fingerprints are checked
Monday against those of Moses and Shawper.
   Doctors at a local mental health center who see Jackson twice a
week say that since he suffered no physical trauma, he might have
suffered an emotional one.
   ``So I'll remember and I won't like what I remember, or I won't
ever remember and I won't like that, either,'' Jackson said.
   It is not a pleasant choice, ``but I would prefer to be me,'' he
said.
   ``There are nights when I lie awake at night thinking, and
there's nothing to think about.''

   Diabetes and its complications cost the nation
some $20.4 billion last year, with about $10.8 billion resulting
from lost productivity and the rest from medical bills, says a
study released Saturday.
   Direct health care costs included $6.9 billion for inpatient
hospital care, $1.7 billion for outpatient care such as doctor
visits and medications, and $942 million for nursing home care.
   The disease, its complications and related issues accounted for
more than 11.5 million days in the hospital, said the report by
Pracon Inc., a research and consulting firm in Reston, Va.
   It was presented at the American Diabetes Association's annual
scientific meeting in New Orleans.
   In all, the report estimated, 6.5 million Americans had
diagnosed cases of diabetes in 1987. Other studies have shown that
about 5 million more Americans have the disease but do not know it.
   The study estimated that nearly 565,000 new cases of diabetes
were diagnosed last year, and that the disease contributed to an
estimated 201,000 deaths.
   In diabetes, the body does not produce or properly use insulin
to control blood sugar levels. Complications of diabetes can
severely damage the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nerves.

   Supporters and critics of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu scuffled Saturday during rival
demonstrations before the black Anglican leader embarked on a trip
to Moscow.
   At least one black man, a supporter of Tutu, was taken into
custody, and police ordered all members of the public to leave the
main hall at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport.
   About 100 of Tutu's supporters remained in the hall and chanted
the archbishop's name when he arrived on a connecting flight from
Cape Town.
   Police and clergymen escorted Tutu and his wife, Leah, through
the hall as his supporters, most of them black, cheered. Many white
onlookers stared in amazement.
   He gave a final wave to the crowd before entering the
international departure area to catch a flight to London. He is to
fly to Moscow on Sunday to join ecumenical celebrations of the
1,000th anniversary of the Russian Orthodox Church.
   About 15 anti-Tutu protesters _ including a few blacks and a
white woman with charcoal on her face and wearing a bishop's
costume _ assembled at Jan Smuts with placards denouncing the
archbishop's support for sanctions against South Africa. One poster
termed Tutu ``Moscow's Puppet,'' while another said: ``Red Carpet
for Tutu _ Red Bombs for Us.''
   It was the fourth airport protest against Tutu since he returned
three weeks ago from a trip to Europe and the United States. During
that trip, he repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against South
Africa as a means of promoting racial reform.
   Saturday marked the first time during the series of protests
that anti-Tutu demonstrators were outnumbered by supporters of the
archbishop, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight
against South Africa's policy of white domination.
   The altercation began after some of the supporters grabbed an
anti-Tutu poster and tore it. Police announced over the public
address system that the arrival hall should be vacated, but many
people _ including members of the rival protest groups _ remained.
   When Tutu arrived, about 45 minutes after the scuffle, one woman
cursed him but few of his other critics were visible.
   Participants in the earlier anti-Tutu protests have included
whites from right-wing organizations and jobless blacks recruited
by conservative black politicians. All the protests have been
filmed and shown on the national television news by the state-run
South African Broadcasting Corp., which frequently denounces Tutu.
   Tutu has described sanctions as one of the few non-violent means
of pressuring the government to end apartheid, under which South
Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
Sanctions could be avoided, he says, if the government dismantled
apartheid and moved to grant the black majority full political
rights.
   Tutu's critics contend that sanctions will result in higher
black unemployment while hardening the attitudes of pro-apartheid
whites.
   These critics also claim most blacks oppose sanctions, but there
is no means of verifying this. Endorsement of sanctions is illegal
under emergency regulations, and blacks are not allowed to vote in
national elections or referendums.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary general of the South African
Council of Churches, said this week that the anti-Tutu protests
were being ``orchestrated ... to give the impression that there was
mounting protest against anti-apartheid groups.''

Demonstration</HEAD>

   A dissident said Saturday that KGB agents in
civilian clothes beat and threw protesters to the ground while
breaking up an unauthorized demonstration by dissidents demanding
the release of political prisoners.
   Yuri Mityunov said at least 12 members of the Democratic Union
opposition political group were dragged away and detained 15
minutes after the protest began Saturday in Moscow's Pushkin Square.
   ``The KGB were extremely rough,'' Mityunov, the Democratic
Union's spokesman, said in a telephone interview. ``They threw
people to the ground, and beat one woman so badly that people
became indignant.''
   Western journalists at the scene said young men in civilian
clothes dragged the demonstrators off the square. A week ago, a
demonstration was held in the same square but was not interrupted.
   The protesters Saturday, said by Mityunov to number about 100,
had gathered to call for the release of Valeriya Novotvorskaya, 38,
who was detained at 6 a.m. Friday at her Moscow apartment.
   The philologist and library worker, one of the founders of the
fledgling Democratic Union, is accused of taking part in an illegal
demonstration on April 15. Other members of the group say she has a
history of heart problems and is very ill.
   Mityunov said police did not permit her to take her medicine
with her when she was detained and said police refused her request
for medical assistance.
   Mityunov said the protesters in Pushkin Square carried banners
calling for the release of Ms. Novotvorskaya, for freedom for all
Soviets imprisoned for their views and for ``an end to repression.''
   He said one man was detained for handing out leaflets that
called for Ms. Novotvorskaya's release and that the others were
taken away by police because they had been carrying protest signs.
   ``They are now in one of Moscow's militia stations,'' Mityunov
said. ``Officials are not telling us where.''
   Last Sunday, members of the Democratic Union joined with groups
of Armenians and Crimean Tatars on Pushkin Square to call for the
release of Soviet political prisoners.
   When the demonstrators marched down Gorky Street, they were
given a police escort. Although they were not allowed to proceed to
Red Square, their chosen destination, police made no move to stop
them when they gathered across from Moscow's city hall and chanted
slogans.
   The Democratic Union was organized last month by a group of
Soviets who want to challenge the political monopoly of the
Communist Party. Among other goals, they are seeking a multi-party
parliamentary system along Western lines and the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Eastern Europe and territory incorporated by the
Soviet Union during World War II.
   Group members say that if Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, is genuine, they will be
allowed to campaign for office.
   However, Mityunov said the fact that KGB agents, and not police
officers, broke up Saturday's demonstration was significant and
potentially worrisome.
   The Committee for State Security, known by its Russian-language
initials as the KGB, is attached to the Council of Ministers, the
equivalent of the country's Cabinet.
   ``Authorities here have decided to permit a small possibility of
democratization, but now they're starting to make
differentiations,'' Mityunov said. ``I think the powers that be
want to make a selection and arrest members of groups that are
hostile to them.''
   He said other unofficial groups were allowed to gather on
Pushkin Square at 4 p.m., less than one hour after the Democratic
Union's protest was broken up, and that no official move was made
to disperse them.

   The industrial giant Daimler-Benz,
which forced thousands of people into work programs to fuel the
Nazi war effort, will pay nearly $12 million to the laborers and
their families, the Red Cross said.
   Heinz Galinski, chairman of the West German Jewish Council, on
Saturday welcomed news of the payment but said the company should
have made reparations years ago.
   ``To wait this long is a horrible betrayal of all those who
suffered,'' Galinski said. ``It comes too late for the thousands
who have died in the meantime.''
   The Red Cross, in a telex statement Friday to the news media,
said a total of 20 million marks, or $11.7 million, would be
distributed to forced labor victims from the company.
   The agency said the money would go to former forced laborers and
to the families of people who died while in forced labor with
Daimler-Benz.
   Daimler-Benz, the largest industrial conglomerate in West
Germany, joins other major German companies that have paid such
reparations. It manufactures buses and automobiles, including the
Mercedes-Benz, and its wide-ranging subsidiaries include a major
aerospace manufacturer.
   The announcement of Daimler-Benz's payments followed a lengthy
study the company commissioned to determine the extent to which
forced laborers were used in its plants during World War II.
   Daimler-Benz had no immediate comment on the payment but
scheduled a press conference Monday at its headquarters in
Stuttgart and said details of the company study would be released
then.
   Company officials said the conference would focus on the ``dark
chapter of forced labor during the Nazi regime'' at Daimler-Benz.
   Like other German companies during Adolf Hitler's Third Reich,
Daimler used forced laborers to help the Nazi effort. Thousands of
forced workers died from ill-treatment or were murdered in Nazi
concentration camps.
   According to a study released in 1987 by an independent
historical research group, more than 46,000 forced laborers were
being used in Daimler-Benz factories in 1944.
   The study, compiled by the Hamburg Foundation for 20th Century
Social History, concluded that by the end of the war, half the
company workers were forced laborers.
   They included people deported from occupied territories,
prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates, the study said.
   The study detailed brutal work conditions and executions of
workers accused of sabotage.
   It also concluded that Daimler management conspired with Nazi
leaders in the early 1930s to make the company the country's chief
producer of engines and vehicles for the military.
   Many of the laborers were from France and the Soviet Union, a
1986 study by the Cologne Society For Industrial History indicates.
   In 1986, the giant Flick conglomerate paid $2.9 million to slave
labor victims. Other West German firms, such as the giant Krupp
concern, a major weapons producer during World War II, have also
paid reparations.
   In addition to the company payments, West Germany has paid
billions of dollars in reparations to victims of the Nazi regime.
   In 1952, the Luxembourg Agreement was signed between West
Germany and the World Jewish Congress.
   Under terms of the agreement, West Germany has paid $48 billion
to Holocaust survivors.

   A half dozen geese flew into the engine of a
Europe-bound Pan Am jumbo jet Saturday, forcing the pilot to shut
it down and return to Kennedy International Airport on the three
remaining engines, authorities said.
   The Boeing 747 landed safely and passengers were transferred to
another plane for the flight to London and Frankfurt, Pan Am
spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
   Flight 100 had taken off at 9:56 a.m. with 387 passengers and 16
crew members aboard. While it was still in its takeoff flight
pattern, it ran into the flock of geese, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
   ``As soon as the captain was aware that there was some
obstruction of the engine, he shut it down,'' Ms. Hanlon said.
   ``It's no big deal,'' said Stan Nowak, a Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey official. ``A 747 is capable of flying on one
engine if it had to.''
   He said the plane had to go out over the Atlantic Ocean to dump
some fuel before it could return to the airport.
   ``With a full fuel load, a plane is too heavy to land on its
gear. That's the way they are designed. They can take off heavier
than they can land,'' Nowak said.
   The pilot had asked for fire and medical equipment to stand by a
precautionary measure but none was needed, Nowak said.

<HEAD>Mecham Criminal Case Goes To Jury This Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham long has
acknowledged he didn't itemize a $350,000 campaign loan on his
financial statements, but it will be up to a jury to decide this
week if that failure was a criminal act.
   Closing arguments are scheduled Tuesday after seven days of
testimony in the trial of the impeached Mecham and his brother,
Willard, on charges of concealing the loan.
   The prosecution's case is based on ``smoke and mirrors,'' Mecham
told reporters after the defense rested its case Friday without
testimony from either defendant.
   ``I'm confident that the state has not proven its case,'' the
former governor said, although he stopped short of predicting he
will be acquitted.
   ``We are confident that the jury will return a just verdict,''
prosecutor Barnett Lotstein said Friday.
   Mecham, a Republican, was removed from office April 4 by
impeachment conviction on two unrelated charges. The state Senate
decided not to consider a charge on the loan for fear of
prejudicing the criminal trial.
   He also was the subject of a recall movement, but an election
was canceled after his impeachment conviction.
   Mecham, 64, first received national attention in January 1987
for his decision to cancel a Martin Luther King holiday for state
executive branch workers on grounds it was illegally created by his
predecessor, Democrat Bruce Babbitt, without legislative
authorization.
   Mecham also drew criticism for defending an author's use of the
word ``pickaninny'' in a book in reference to black children, and
he made a variety of statements that offended women, Jews,
homosexuals and Japanese-Americans.
   In the criminal case, he faces up to 22 years in prison if
convicted on all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment
and filing false documents.
   Willard Mecham, who was treasurer for his younger brother's 1986
campaign, faces up to 9{ years in prison if convicted of three
similar counts.
   The prosecution contended that Mecham's campaign badly needed
the $350,000 loan from developer Barry Wolfson, but that Mecham
wanted to conceal its source because it would contradict his
campaign theme of being ``beholden to no one.''
   None of Mecham's personal or campaign financial reports lists a
$350,000 loan from Wolfson. Instead, one campaign report includes a
$465,000 lump sum identified as a contribution from Mecham himself.
The $450,000 also included a $100,000 loan to Mecham from a
financial institution and a $15,000 contribution by Mecham.
   The Mechams put up two defenses: that the loan was properly
listed as part of the $465,000 lump sum, and that the failure to
itemize the loan was an innocent mistake by Willard Mecham.
   Also, former top Mecham aide Edith Richardson testified for the
defense that the loan was ``common knowledge'' among Mecham's inner
circle.
   The prosecution said it was immaterial whether Mecham's closest
aides knew about the Wolfson loan.
   ``This is the document where the public gets its information,
isn't that true?'' prosecutor Michael Cudahy asked one witness,
referring to Mecham's contribution and expenditure report. ``I'm
not talking about insiders in the campaign, finance chairmen, close
confidantes of Evan Mecham.''
   Mecham long has acknowledged that the Wolfson loan appeared
nowhere on his financial statements outside of the $465,000 lump
sum, until he filed an amended form in November 1987.
   He also insisted last fall that the loan was made to the
campaign, not to him personally.
   But Wolfson testified that he considered the loan a personal
one, not to the campaign.
   A former Mecham campaign finance committee member, Vern Gasser,
testified that he couldn't recall the meaning of notes he took
during a committee meeting in fall 1986. The notes said ``show Evan
borrowed money'' and ``don't show borrowed money.''
   Mecham refused to say Friday why he did not testify. His
attorney, Michael Scott, said he wanted to avoid having his client
``brutalized'' on cross-examination.

   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
response to President Reagan's weekly radio address Saturday, given
by Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri:
   Since 1981, we've seen our trade deficit skyrocket more than
four times over. We've seen millions of manufacturing jobs lost and
thousands of farmers thrown off their land.
   During these years, the president has stood idly by, failing to
develop a trade policy to enhance American competitiveness. He even
called our trade deficit a sign of strength.
   Three years ago, the Democrats took the bull by the horns and
crafted a trade policy that would enhance our competitiveness. We
fought for fundamental change in our trade policy and were able to
forge a consensus, at least among Democrats, about what we must do
to do compete, strengthen education, improve productivity, and
invest in plan and equipment and people. The human factor would be
the most decisive factor of production.
   In a historic effort, Democrats working with Republicans were
able to craft a bill. It took three years and countless discussions
to write. It was designed to put the tools in the hands of our
workers and businesses, to improve our competitiveness and pry open
markets.
   Despite the strong support for the bill, President Reagan vetoed
the measure. In doing so, he deprived us of the trade policy we so
desperately need.
   President Reagan based his veto on his objection to the plant
closing provision in the bill _ a provision which he claims will
hurt business and had nothing to do with trade. America needs the
plant closing law.
   If we're going to prepare for the future rather than protect
against it, we must give our workers the time needed to adjust and
find new employment. It's a simple provision. It requires
management to give workers a 60-day notice of impending plant
closure _ nothing more, nothing less.
   During my travels across the country, I met countless workers
who had suffered from the lack of a plant-closing provision. There
is simply no justification for a worker showing up at the plant
gate for work to find it chained shut.
   Many businesses have joined with the president in fighting the
provision. At the same time they have fought for their own golden
parachute and 60-day notification for themselves in hostile
takeover situations. They refuse to grant workers the same
consideration. .
   I refuse to accept the president's notion that people can be
treated just like any other asset, to be discarded when no longer
needed. Our workers are the best in the world. They've proven their
ability to adapt to change. In many cases, labor and management
working together have been able to find solutions to the company's
problems.
   The plant closing provision is an investment in our people. It's
unfortunate that the president chose to scuttle the trade bill
because of his opposition to this provision. We desperately need a
trade bill. Trade is not an academic issue; it is a human issue. We
cant continue to follow the course set by this administration.
   We've seen our position as the world's largest creditor nation
erode to that of the largest debtor. We continue to run historic
trade deficits. Behind these numbers are real people _ business
people and workers who've seen their companies go under because of
unfair foreign competition, farmers who have lost their farms
because they can't sell their products overseas.
   It's time for a change in our trade policy to put our economic
ship of state back on course. The plain and painful fact is that
without any incentive for reciprocity many of our trading partners
are using our outdated assumptions to take advantage of us. We've
got to realize that the world has changed and we must change with
it.
   Mr. President, the trade deficit is not a sign of strength; it's
a sign of a failed policy. We must now work together to change that
policy and make America strong again.

   A judge has ordered that millions of
dollars believed channeled into Swiss banks by former Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos be returned to his homeland, the Justice
Ministry said Saturday.
   Although no figure was given, the assets involved were believed
to be a small part of the $1 billion that Philippines officials
suspect Marcos put into Swiss bank accounts during his 20-year rule.
   The ruling covered assets in banks in the western state of
Fribourg.
   Swiss media said Marcos has $50 million in Fribourg banks, but
Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler refused comment on the
reports.
   The judge also gave authorities in the Philippines access to
relevant bank records in Fribourg, one of 26 cantons, or states, in
Switzerland. The ruling seems certain to be challenged by Marcos'
lawyers.
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines arrives on an
official visit on Wednesday and is expected to discuss her
government's efforts to recoup Marcos assets in Switzerland. The
assets have been frozen by the government since March 1986.
   In an unpublished decision Tuesday, Investigating Magistrate
Pierre-Emmanuel Esseiva freed the Fribourg assets for delivery to a
Philippines criminal court, which will decide if they were
illegally acquired, Kistler said.
   Bank documents will be given to the Philippines general
prosecutor, he said.
   A ruling by Switzerland's highest court in July 1987 lifted bank
secrecy for an investigation of Marcos' assets by Swiss
authorities, but Manila was not given access to the results of that
probe.
   Most of the Marcos assets are believed to be in Zurich, where
appeals by Marcos lawyers and Credit Suisse bank have delayed
investigators.
   By contrast, authorities in Geneva are expected to rule soon on
a repatriation of any assets they have found.
   Marcos, who was deposed in February 1986 and now lives in exile
in Hawaii, has denied having money in Swiss banks.

   Crews worked around the clock Saturday to
repair earthquake damage at a pumping plant that shut down the
California Aqueduct and its supply of water to the southern half of
the state, officials said.
   The damage to circuit breakers at the A.D. Edmonston Pumping
Plant, which pumps water over the Tehachapi Mountains northwest of
Los Angeles, was the most significant damage from Friday's quake.
   There was no water shortage because of sufficient supplies in
storage lakes, according to state Department of Water Resources
dispatcher Harry Said in Sacramento.
   ``The aqueduct itself ... is intact with no damage,'' he said,
and the plant was expected to begin pumping again on a limited
basis on Sunday.
   The only injuries blamed on the quake, felt in central and
southern areas of the state, were in Whittier, east of Los Angeles,
where a tree fell about the time of the temblor. A woman and two
men were treated for injuries, said Fire Capt. Harold Fullbright.
   The quake also tumbled rocks onto Interstate 5 close to the
quake's center, but traffic was not blocked. The quake was also
strong enough to knock goods off shelves at a Wheeler Ridge truck
stop.
   The temblor at 4:06 p.m. Friday measured 5.2 on the Richter
scale. It was centered on the Garlock Fault, 11 miles
north-northeast of Gorman in the Tehachapis northwest of Los
Angeles, according to seismologists at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   It was followed by a series of aftershocks, the largest
measuring 4.0.
   The 200 mile-long Garlock Fault is the second-largest fault in
California. The largest is the 600 mile-long San Andreas Fault.
   The California Aqueduct runs 440 miles from Tracy, near the
Sacramento River delta, taking water that has flowed to the delta
from rivers in northern California, south to Perris in Riverside
County. It provides half of Southern California's water.

   Ninth-grader Michael Duff caught grief
from his grandmother for spray-painting graffiti on a company's
wall, but the firm's president loved the work and commissioned the
youngster to do a mural.
   Michael, 14, said he and friend Travell Brown, 15, designed the
painting and sneaked out to the Metrolina Courier Inc. building
early Monday. Michael spent two hours squirting the blue spray
paint. The next night he did the same thing.
   Michael covered 40 feet of a concrete-block wall with words,
buildings, clouds, an angry face and lots of star bursts. ``I call
it bubble letters,'' he said. ``I got the idea from the letters on
the ice machine at the store.''
   Company President Joseph Greene loved it. In Thursday's
Charlotte Observer, he and partner Harrill Jones offered to pay the
artist to design and paint a mural. Michael read the article and
called Greene on Friday.
   Michael and Travell agreed to draw up plans for the wall over
the weekend. They didn't discuss with Greene how much the job was
worth.
   But Michael's grandmother, Pearl Brown, said Friday she wasn't
happy and punished Michael by giving him a dusk curfew.
   ``I scolded him and told him he knows better than that,'' she
said.
   ``Wrong is wrong,'' she said.

   The Army wants Anne M. Verret to put her
``talent and valuable training'' back to work with the New Jersey
National Guard. It even promises that she can work with ``the
world's most sophisticated and expensive military equipment.''
   There's one problem, though. Anne Verret is a 59-year-old
grandmother and homemaker who has never been in the armed forces
and has never lived in New Jersey.
   Mrs. Verret received the letter and accompanying literature
Thursday from the Department of the Army and the Air Force in
Trenton, N.J. Included was a form letter from New Jersey Gov.
Thomas H. Kean congratulating Mrs. Verret on her military service
and asking her to join the state unit.
   Mrs. Verret said Friday her husband, who was in the Marines for
20 years, ``thinks it's a scream.'' But she said she found it
annoying.
   Carl Golden, a spokesman for Kean, said the National Guard had
asked the governor, a former guard member, to head the guard's
recent recruitment drive.
   ``Whenever you have a mailing of this size, there's bound to be
letters that go to people who don't apply to the situation,''
Golden said.
   Sgt. 1st Class John K. O'Zemko, director of marketing for the
New Jersey Army National Guard, said Friday the guard sent out
300,000 letters, including 70,000 in neighboring Pennsylvania, with
the help of a mailing list provided by a New York company.
   Mrs. Verret was not the only one who shouldn't have received the
letter. O'Zemko said he received calls from several people who said
the letter missed its mark.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Jackson Camps Battle Over Taxes For Rich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sparks flew Saturday among
Democratic platform writers over whether to raise taxes on wealthy
Americans, the issue creating the largest gulf between the camps of
cinch presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and runner-up Jesse
Jackson.
   The plaform drafters put off until Sunday discussion of defense
and foreign policy issues, while their staffs worked behind the
scenes to draft planks on drugs, civil rights, the economy and
other domestic issues.
   Janice Thurmond, an Athens, Ga., lawyer and Jackson delegate,
urged the platform committee to lend Dukakis ``a hand'' by giving
him a credible platform, including a pledge to raise taxes on those
earning $100,000-plus a year.
   ``I am not trying to hamstring our party's nominee. ... We need
to give him an answer that is believable when he is accused of
being a tax-and-spend Democrat,'' Thurmond told her 15 colleagues
on the drafting panel.
   ``It would be irresponsible of us not to give him an answer that
he can look any Republican straight in the eye and say, `I am not a
tax-and-spend Democrat; I am a raise-revenue-and-invest-in-America
Democrat,' and be proud of that,'' said Thurmond, whose father was
Jackson's football coach in high school.
   But Lena Guerrero, a Texas state representative and Dukakis
backer from Austin, said the talk of raising taxes troubled her.
``I think what we have to do is re-order our priorities,'' she
said. ``Surely there is a better solution than `Give me more.'''
   Other Dukakis delegates said the party should look first to
crack down on tax evaders, as the Massachusetts governor has
promised.
   Rep. Robert Matsui of California said, ``I find no need to even
raise it in the platform because that would give Bush the
opportunity to say, `Oh, look! They're interested in at least some
kind of new taxes.''
   Michael Barnes, Dukakis's top emissary to the platform
committee, made a conciliatory statement, saying, ``If it were
required to have revenue increases down the road, clearly Democrats
are going to see that as a last resort.'' Any new revenues would be
``based upon policies that recognize who has the ability to pay,''
he added.
   But Barnes told reporters afterwards, ``The Democratic platform
in 1988 is not going to call for a tax increase.''
   ``There's no question we're going to prevail,'' said Barnes, a
former Maryland congressman. ``Bruce Babbitt is a great guy, but he
didn't win the nomination.'' Babbitt, like Jackson, promised to
raise taxes.
   The drafting committee will hold its third and final day of
meetings Sunday at this resort's Grand Hotel.
   The full 186-member platform committee meets in Denver June
25-26.
   Rep. William Gray III of Philadelphia, who chairs the drafting
panel, said, ``If we can reach a strong consensus and agreement in
the drafting committee, then I think the chances of a large number
of significant amendments in Denver that potentiallay could be
divisive and ripping of the fabric of our party will be lessened.
The same thing will be true in Atlanta,'' said Gray.
   Gray, a Baptist minister, left at mid-day to officiate at the
wedding of a friend's daughter in Atlanta, but planned to return
afterwards.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's chief emissary, said the tax
dispute was ``perhaps the most difficult issue and perhaps the
greatest difference between the Dukakis and the Jackson campaigns.
I cannot say for sure whether we will be able to work out
compromise language.''
   ``This is a driving force in the Jackson campaign. Otherwise we
think the Democrats risk being ridiculed for wanting to change
priorities but having no vision of how you get the money to do
it,'' she said.
   She said Barnes' comments on revenues just restated what Dukakis
has said all along. ``One wonders if we aren't already at the last
resort. We've got a deficit that keeps growing. When do you get to
the resort that is the last one? We think you've got to face this
issue now,'' she said.

<HEAD>Deputy Suspended Because Her Fingernails Are Too Long</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's deputy whose fingernails are a
quarter-inch over regulation was suspended for four days after she
refused to trim them, saying she's had them long all her 10 years
on the job and they don't interfere with her work.
   Danielle Rogers, who works at the Hennepin County juvenile
center, has nails that are three-eighths inch past her fingertips.
A grooming policy adopted by the sheriff's department May 16 says
nails may not be longer than an eighth of an inch.
   The policy covers a range of subjects, including the length and
style of hair, personal hygiene and wearing jewelry.
   Rogers filed a grievance over the policy, claiming it is an
issue that should have been decided in collective bargaining
between department officials and the deputies' union. She was
suspended Wednesday for a day for violating the rule, and again on
Thursday, this time for three days, for not trimming her nails.
   On Friday, the union filed suit against Hennepin County and
Sheriff Don Omodt, claiming that the failure to negotiate the
policy was an unfair labor practice and that Rogers was disciplined
for exercising her right to file a grievance.
   Hennepin County District Judge Ann Montgomery denied a temporary
restraining order Friday and scheduled a hearing for Monday on
whether a preliminary injunction should be issued.
   Omodt did not return a telephone call to the department
Saturday. His home telephone is unlisted.
   In an affidavit filed with the court, Rogers said she has had
her nails the same length for the 10 years she has worked as a
deputy and they do not affect her work.
   The objection is not over the grooming policy, said her
attorney, Marshall Tanick, but over the failure of the county to
bargain with the union. He also said there is a right to privacy in
personal appearance as long as it is not detrimental to the job.
   Another problem with the policy, Tanick said, is that it does
not spell out what the consequences are for violating it.
   Rogers has been threatened with disciplinary action up to
dismissal, according to court documents.
   Karla Hancock, assistant Hennepin County attorney, said Friday
there was no need to bargain about the policy because it falls
under management's rights, rather than being a term and condition
of employment that must be negotiated.
   Said Tanick: ``We believe there are serious law enforcement
issues in the county that merit attention. Too much time and energy
has been devoted to this petty issue.
   ``As long as the deputy is competent,the length of her nails
should not matter.''

<HEAD>Rapidly Changing China Leaves Maoist Ideology Behind</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In China, a nation that takes its political
slogans seriously, a large billboard in a provincial capital,
reading ``Efficiency Is Life _ Time Is Money,'' is a dramatic sign
of the times.
   It is an indication of how Communist Party ideologists, the
shapers of public opinion, have been backed into a corner by the
rapid acceptance of private ownership, shareholding and free
markets _ all capitalistic challenges to Marxist-Leninist doctrine.
   ``Capitalism has absorbed things from socialism _ now we should
absorb some good things from capitalism,'' said Zhao Yao, dean of
the Communist Party Central Committee College, a training ground
for ideologists.
   Capitalism was once dismissed in China as an evil opposed to
socialism.
   ``But we now believe that was wrong,'' added Zhao.
   The official doctrines that have often forced the Chinese to
worry about whether they are being good communists have been in a
state of flux since Deng Xiaoping, the pragmatist famed for saying,
``It doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it
catches mice,'' came to power 10 years ago.
   Declaring that ``poverty is not socialism,'' he dismantled Mao
Tse-tung's communes, restored the profit motive and unleashed
free-market forces into a rigid system of central planning.
   Today, the concern of most Chinese is how to get better wages
and cope with rising prices.
   ``As long as the economy is prosperous and living standards are
raised, our purpose is fulfilled,'' said Li Yining, a prominent
economist.
   This month, the Communist Party will publish its last issue of
the journal ``Red Flag,'' whose heavy prose has for 30 years set
the tone for party ideology. In its place, the party will
inaugurate a publication called ``Seeking Truth,'' which is
expected to concentrate on economic reforms and political
democratization.
   Party leader Zhao Ziyang, a major supporter of economic reforms,
announced at a party conference last fall that China will be in
what he called the ``primary stage'' of socialism through the
middle of the next century.
   Zhao told economic planners they would be allowed to adapt
capitalist practices as long as these advanced the national goal of
economic development. Party propagandists hailed Zhao's
laissez-faire approach to socialism, which played down the need for
ideology to back up policy.
   The Guangming Daily, China's leading intellectual newspaper,
said in a recent commentary that great changes have taken place in
the past decade.
   ``However, we cannot deny that in many places dogmatism, like a
specter, still binds the people's thinking and hampers the
development of socialist modernization,'' it said, adding that even
these days, almost every new economic or political reform must
still overcome suspicions of being too ``capitalistic.''
   By adopting unorthodox approaches to Marxism and capitalism, the
new theorists are trying to legitimize reforms that have brought
China television commercials promoting consumption, free markets
taking away business from state stores, and millionaires with
servants.
   Many of the new theorists say the ideology of Karl Marx, who
lived in the 19th century, cannot explain the modern relationship
between socialism and capitalism. They say Mao's insistence on
class struggle over economic development was a disaster for China.
   Leading social scientist Li Honglin recently wrote that the
Soviet Union _ once China's model as an economic system _ has
failed to match the productive energy of capitalist countries.
   ``Socialism is not a cake that can be ordered, and there is no
fixed pattern for socialism,'' Li wrote.
   ``To promote reforms we must make breakthroughs in theory,''
said Zhao Yao, dean of the Party Central Committee College.
   Shareholding, private ownership of property and even the
democratic process are other Western practices that can be of use
to Chinese socialism, the party school theorists said.
   Zhao said China's 18 million private entrepreneurs have become
``an important auxiliary part'' of the economy.
   But the party theorists insist that China remain a socialist
country whose vital task is to define socialism to meet the
country's changing needs.
   Reflecting this task, the Chinese Academy of Social Science has
said it will this year start a new research project _ the study of
a modified form of socialism.
   The head of the research team will be one of China's most
progressive political thinkers, Su Shaozhi, who a year ago was
fired from his position as head of the academy's Marxism-Leninism
Institute for being too liberal.

   Investigators tried Saturday to piece together
what happened to a free-lance gemologist between her disappearance
in February while carrying more than $500,000 in diamonds and her
death less than a month ago.
   An autopsy on Barbara Mangiameli, 33, whose naked body was found
Thursday floating in the Hudson River near lower Manhattan, showed
that she died within the last month of a beating to the head.
   She was last seen at her Manhattan apartment building the day
she was supposed to return six diamonds worth between $500,000 and
$600,000 to their owner after a proposed sale fell through.
   Two brothers who allegedly arranged a meeting between a
potential buyer and Ms. Mangiameli are in federal custody on
charges they pawned one of the missing diamonds in Florida.
   They are not suspected in the murder because they have been in
custody since April, and Ms. Mangiameli was then alive according to
the autopsy.
   Ms. Mangiameli's body was covered by plastic bags and was bound
in the fetal position by a Venetian blind cord around the neck,
wrists and ankles, police said.
   An autopsy Friday found she died from multiple blunt force
injuries to the scalp and face that caused skull fractures, brain
contusions and brain hemorrhaging, said Ellen Borakove, a
spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office.
   She was identified through dental records and an appendectomy
scar, Ms. Borakove said.
   ``According to the doctor who did the case, she wasn't in the
water for very long,'' Ms. Borakove said. ``She was not dead for a
very long period of time from the time they found her yesterday. It
certainly is not months. Whether it's weeks or days, I cannot pin
it down.''
   Ms. Mangiameli had worked for 10 years in advertising and two
years ago went into the gem business. She recently graduated from
the Gemological Institute of America Inc.

   Vanquished Republican presidential candidates said
Saturday that George Bush represents ``safe change'' and transition
from the Reagan era, but warned GOP activists it would be fatal to
take his election for granted.
   ``It is not for the vice president to win this election by
himself,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole told a ``Unity '88''
conference. ``The task is too large, the stakes are too high and
the opposition too bitter.''
   Dole was joined by Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and former Secretary
of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. in seeking to rally party officials
and activists from 16 states while Bush enjoyed a one-day campaign
respite in Houston.
   Meanwhile, Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said he would
not worry if Bush continued to trail Democrat Michael Dukakis in
the polls because Bush ``operates better in the underdog position.''
   Atwater also said he believes that Bush has a wellspring of
support in Florida, Texas, the Sun Belt states and much of the
west, and that this translates to a core support base constituting
210 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.
   ``He's constantly underestimated,'' Atwater told the party
activists.
   Atwater said the possible disaffection of Jesse Jackson from the
Democratic cause, if Jackson is given short-shrift treatment in
Atlanta by Dukakis, ``offers a great opportunity'' for Bush to
improve his standing among minority voters.
   He also said he expects Bush to reap much of the support from
Democrats and independents who backed Ronald Reagan, saying these
voters ``will come back in droves'' when the Dukakis' views become
better known.
   Bush has been trailing Dukakis in public opinion polls,
sometimes by 15 or more percentage points. But Atwater noted Bush's
comeback from his loss to Dole in the leadoff Iowa caucuses and
said, ``Now, he operates better in the underdog position. He enjoys
it more. I don't care if we're behind. We may be behind all along.''
   The former candidates coupled appeals for Bush support with
stinging denunciations of Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee.
   ``Somebody ought to let Gov. Dukakis know that there is no
owner's manual for the White House,'' said Dole, who during the
campaign had accused Bush of being a do-nothing stand-in for
President Reagan at ceremonial events.
   Kemp, speaking to a luncheon audience, urged Bush to keep
working to broaden the base of the party. He also said the
Republicans should not concede the Northeast to Dukakis.
   ``Please don't write off the Northeast. Please don't think we
can win by knitting together some kind of electoral base from the
Sun Belt, and forget the Northeast. ... Don't write off anybody,''
he said.
   Haig said that Bush ``represents safe change'' for America,
while Dukakis would bring about ``radical and dangerous change.''
   ``I think America in 1988 does not want extremism of the left or
righp,'' zaig said.
   Haig said the Massachusetts governor is the voice for
``discredited and disconsolate liberals,'' and told his GOP
audience the party must work to bring back disaffected
conservatives in its own ranks.
   ``We know that the Reagan revolution, the Reagan era, is nearly
over,'' he said. Haig said some conservatives who supported the
Reagan cause have become disenchanted, and he said the party must
be vigilant about voters who thirst for change after seven and a
half years.
   ``Many are beginning to nit-pick at the fringes,'' displaying
worry about such problems as drugs and declining educational
performance, he said.
   Speculation about Bush's likely choice as a vice presidential
running mate hovered over this meeting, popping up in lounge and
coffee-shop talk at the Hyatt Regency hotel here.
   During a workshop speech, Haig joked about suggestions that
``we're all here because we all want to be on the ticket.'' The
former NATO commander and onetime White House chief of staff for
President Nixon said ``I'm content'' with having made a try for the
GOP nomination.
   Bush has indicated he will not seriously consider whom to select
until Dukakis has made his choice known.
   Party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf urged Republican activists to
work hard for Bush at the grass-roots level, saying that ``you
don't do from a podium, you don't do it with slick television ads,
and George Bush will not be the next president of the United States
unless we do it _ work hard.''
   Dole said Bush supporters should not be disheartened by the
various polls showing the vice president trailing Dukakis, saying
the governor had benefitted from eight weeks of primary victories
after the GOP race had essentially ended.
   America likes ``the calm and reassuring continuity George Bush
represents,'' Dole said.

<HEAD>Iranians Attack Two Ships In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian gunboats staged daylight attacks
Saturday on a West German freighter and a British-owned supertanker
350 miles apart in the Persian Gulf. One crewman died and two were
wounded in the attacks.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
raids ``could easily be interpreted as a direct show of defiance''
by Iran of American military might in the gulf.
   A U.S. warship was dispatched to aid the 258,979-ton British
supertanker Esso Demetia off the Saudi Arabian coast after it sent
out what a U.S. Navy spokesman called a ``general appeal for
assistance.''
   The American spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, said the U.S.
warship, which he declined to name, would provide ``humanitarian
assistance.''
   He said reports indicated that the Esso Demetia was on fire.
Gulf-based shipping executives, who had reported the attack
earlier, said the supertanker crew was battling serious fires on
board.
   In London, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the Esso
Demetia ``was attacked by two fast boats,'' had a fire in its
tanks, and lost one lifeboat. It said no injuries were reported.
   Four hours earlier, a Filipino crew member was killed and two
others were critically wounded when two gunboats fired on the
11,744-ton German frighter Dhaulagiri in the Strait of Hormuz.
   The ship was under charter to the American Presidents Line Ltd.,
of San Francisco, according to shipping executives, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   As with other recent Iranian forays against commercial shipping,
the raids caught the U.S. warships patrolling the gulf out of
position to intervene with force, had they been asked to do so.
There are about 10 American warships patrolling the waters.
   Under expanded ``rules of engagement'' that went into effect on
May 3, U.S. commanders in the gulf are allowed to intervene when a
non-U.S. flag ship in international waters asks for help. The six
Iranian attacks since May 3 have been away from areas where they
might encounter opposition from the U.S. ships.
   The 11,744-ton Dhaulagiri was sailing northward into the strait
when it was attacked Saturday morning.
   The attack on the Dhaulagiri was the first by Iran in two weeks.
It followed Iraq's attack Thursday that killed two crew members
aboard a chartered tugboat. Iraq claimed another air strike on
Friday but it was not independently confirmed.
   The Dhaulagiri was manned by five Germans and 14 Filipinos, the
shipping executives said, and all the casualties were Filipinos.
   The executives said a man speaking with a Filipino accent was
heard on the radio calling frantically for assistance after the
attack.
   ``He was begging, almost crying, for helicopter assistance to
remove the wounded,'' one executive said.
   They said an Omani Navy patrol boat responded to the distress
call and took the injured to a hospital.
   The Dhaulagiri was bound for the Saudi Arabian port of Dammam
when attacked, and it headed to Dubai for repairs Saturday, the
sources said.
   Since violence from the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq conflict spilled
into the gulf in 1984, more than 500 merchant ships have been
damaged or lost and more than 300 sailors killed.

   About 30,000 people marched
against apartheid Saturday in one of the largest Dutch
demonstrations against South Africa's government, police said.
   No arrests occurred during the peaceful demonstration, said a
police official, who spoke on conditon of anonymity.
   The demonstration, which caused huge traffic jams downtown,
coincided with a 10-hour rock concert in London honoring Nelson
Mandela, a jailed black South African anti-apartheid leader.
   The demonstrators carried banners denouncing South Africa's
government as ``fascist.''
   During the rally, the Rev. Alan Boesak, the South African
anti-apartheid activist, attacked South Africa's system of racial
separation, in which its 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs.
   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.
   Anti-apartheid feelings are widespread in the Netherlands, from
where the first white settlers of South Africa sailed in the early
17th century.

   Tribesmen in a mountainous region of
northern Oman set up a round-the-clock watch for a wolf after the
remains of 6-year-old girl were found in a cave near their village,
newspapers reported Saturday.
   A goat shepherd found the remains of Miriam Toubiah, who had
been missing since March, in a cave 6,000 feet up Green Mountain.
   The village of Saiq, where the child lived, searched for her
after she disappeared. A witness reportedly heard a scream seconds
before she vanished.
   Villagers said a wild wolf made off with a child in a similar
incident three years ago. Although it is against the law to hunt
wildlife in Oman, the head sheik of Saiq received permission to
shoot wolves, the papers said.

   Was the American Cancer Society guilty
of ``boarish'' behavior in putting Sen. Albert Gore Jr.'s name on a
fund-raising letter advertising its Swine Ball without asking him
first?
   Gore's name appeared as honorary chairman of Saturday night's
charity event on a mailing signed by ``The Pig Fairy,'' and the
onetime presidential hopeful suggested, tongue-in-jowl, that
perhaps a federal investigation should be launched into
unauthorized use of his name.
   ``It is an honor to be named honorary chairman. Of course, it
would have been an even greater honor if they had asked me first,''
he said.
   Gore said he learned of the letter when Tennessee Valley
Authority Chairman Marvin Runyon wrote to him, remarking,
``Frankly, I am very surprised that you would allow your name to be
used with such a boarish event.''
   Runyon also said that in view of the fact that the number 1992
might have some significance for Gore, he was sending a check for
$1992 to the Swine Ball.
   ``This is a $4 reduction from last year, as I think under your
honorary leadership the event will be awful,'' Runyon joked.
   Gore, noting that Runyon actually gave $2,000 last year, called
the letter ``shocking evidence'' that the chairman of the
multimillion-dollar TVA ``cannot do simple arithmetic,'' since the
check is actually an $8 reduction from his previous donation.
   The Swine Ball is a spoof of the high-society Swan Ball, which
raises money for the Cheekwood Art Museum.
   Country superstar Waylon Jennings was to join the Metro Police
Blue Lights Band as entertainment at the fund-raiser, where guests
dine on hot dogs on stale buns, pig knuckles, beans, barbecue and
beer.

   Mountain climbers will place a huge sheet over the
Arc de Triomphe to hide restoration work on the capital's beloved
monument.
   On Friday, 25 mountaineers will climb 165 feet to the top of the
arch to hang a 2,400-square-yard, red-white-and-blue canvas sheet
on one side of the monument.
   The first phase of work will take the entire day, organizers
said, with the other faces of the monument to be covered with
sheets in the following days.
   More than four tons of paint were used to cover the canvas in
the red, white and blue colors of the French flag.
   About $6 million will be spent to repair water and pollution
damage to the arch, which was constructed in 1806-1835 as a
monument to Napolean's armies.

   Four railroad tanker cars, including two
containing flammable chemicals, overturned near downtown Saturday,
forcing authorities to close one of the city's main thoroughfares.
   A railroad worker was taken to a hospital with minor injuries he
received from inhaling vapor given off by anhydrous trimethylamine,
a volatile chemical that leaked from one of the cars.
   Only a small amount of vapor was escaping, said Deputy Fire
Chief William Hanf, and the other three cars were not leaking. One
of the other cars contained butane and the other two were empty.
   The accident occurred shortly after noon near the intersection
of Ohio 315, which links the city and its city's northern suburbs,
and Goodale Boulevard just northeast of downtown. Police and fire
officials closed two entrances to Highway 315.
   Charles Hartley, 41, the injured worker, was in fair condition
at Doctor's Hospital-North, a nursing supervisor said.
   According to a hazardous materials handbook published by the
U.S. Department of Transportation, anhydrous trimethylamine gives
off vapor that is irritating and harmful if inhaled and is
extremely flammable. The fumes may be ignited by heat, sparks or
flame, the handbook said.
   Butane, which is used as a fuel, is explosive and flammable.

   Soviet leaders came and went, but Vasily Shipilov
stayed _ in prison.
   Then came Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and now Shipilov, a 60-year-old
Russian Orthodox deacon who spent more than half his life behind
bars, is a free man.
   But he is also a broken man, so out of touch with his country
that he never heard of ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's system of
reforms for the Soviet Union.
   After 36 years in labor camps, prisons and psychiatric
hospitals, Shipilov was suddenly released on May 31 from a Siberian
mental hospital, flown to Moscow, put in another psychiatric
hospital and released Friday.
   Many such hospitals had become notorious for being used by the
government to jail political prisoners. The diagnosis used to keep
Shipilov locked up was that he was schizophrenic.
   Shipilov, hunched over and frail-looking, limped into a Moscow
apartment Saturday to face two dozen reporters and fellow
Christians. An elderly woman broke down in tears at the sight of
the brown-haired man with a drawn face and tired brown eyes.
   Shipilov crossed himself every time he rose to speak _ something
he says he did even while locked up. He had difficulty answering
reporters' questions, giving rambling and confused answers.
   Asked what he thinks of perestroika, Shipilov responded: ``I
don't know anything about it. I was in isolation.''
   At one point, Shipilov said he was put in a straitjacket and
beaten for refusing to mop floors on a religious holiday.
   ``He's only seen doctors. He's not used to our world,'' said
Alexander Ogorodnikov, a Christian activist who has also been
jailed.
   ``We hope he is the last of the Stalin-era prisoners, but we
don't know for sure,'' said Ogorodnikov, who introduced Shipilov to
the reporters.
   There were other signs that the Orthodox deacon was out of touch
with the times.
   Shipilov apparently had never seen a bottle of soft drink before
_ he asked if the Pepsi put before him was wine.
   Soviet authorities gave him a passport, and he plans to leave
June 17 for Britain, then settle in the Holy Trinity Russian
Orthodox Seminary in Jordanville, N.Y.
   The release came during the celebration of the 1,000th
anniversary of Christianity in Russia, an event that has brought
new focus on Soviet restrictions on religious freedom.
   But Shipilov credits only one person for his release _ the Rev.
Dick Rodgers, an Anglican minister from Birmingham, England, who
has waged a 10-year campaign for the Orthodox clergyman.
   To draw attention to Shipilov's plight, the 41-year-old minister
spent 46 days during Lent this year in a cage made of wood and
chicken wire outside St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in London. He
told Saturday's news conference he had collected 36,000 signatures
on a petition demanding Shipilov's release.
   Rodgers first met the man he helped to free at Moscow's
Psychiatric Hospital No. 7. on Thursday. On Saturday, the minister
smiled broadly and presented Shipilov with a British-made religious
icon and a box of chocolates.
   Shipilov said he was born in the southern Siberian region of
Altai and was first arrested in 1949 under the leader he calls
``the Communist bandit,'' Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   He had been studying at an underground Orthodox seminary in
Siberia.
   He then spent two years in a labor camp and was released before
being arrested again in 1954 for alleged anti-Soviet behavior. He
also spent time in four Soviet psychiatric hospitals.
   Shipilov said he learned to interpret the Soviet government's
claim that it provides free medical care.
   ``Not free care, but free torment,'' he said.
   ``I am healthy,'' he added.
   Rodgers said Shipilov's survival was ``a tribute to his faith in
God.''
   Gorbachev's reforms, in addition to bringing changes in the
economy, have also resulted in the release of more than 140
political and religious activists in the past few years.
   Soviet officials announced in January that a new law would make
it illegal to commit a ``patently healthy'' person to a mental
institution. The government has also said that some mental
hospitals administered by the Interior Ministry, which controls the
police and prisons, were being transferred to the Health Ministry.

<TEXT>
   Premiers Andreas Papandreou of Greece and
Turgut Ozal of Turkey open talks under tight security Monday in an
effort to cement a fragile reconciliation between the traditionally
hostile NATO allies.
   Ozal's three-day visit to Athens _ the first by a Turkish
premier in 36 years _ is the latest move to improve relations after
a Greek-Turkish summit at the Swiss ski resort of Davos in January.
   ``We went to Davos and agreed on a no-war course ... we haven't
ensured peace, but we're striving for consolidation of peace in the
region,'' Papandreou recently told Parliament.
   Fifteen months ago, Greece and Turkey nearly went to war over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean in a flare-up that apparently
persuaded Papandreou to change his hard-line policy toward Turkey.
   For years, the former American economics professor had rejected
Ozal's offers of friendship, suggesting that Turkey had deep-laid
plans to invade several Greek islands near Turkey's Aegean coast.
   Papandreou's anti-Turkish rhetoric struck a chord with Greeks
who view Turkey with suspicion tinged with fear _ a legacy of four
centuries of Ottoman Turkish rule in Greece and periodic eruptions
of violence over the past 30 years.
   ``There were anti-Greek riots in Turkey in the 1950s, trouble
over Cyprus in the '60s and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.
It's hard to believe the Turks really want to be friends,'' said
businessman Ioakim Papazoglou, whose family used to live in Turkey.
   Although Greeks welcome the reduced tension, the speed and style
of Papandreou's policy switch has produced criticism from both
conservatives and leftists.
   ``Perhaps the suddenness of Davos took people by surprise, but
what's being done is a step-by-step process that will take a long
time, perhaps a decade, to bear fruit,'' said a Greek diplomat who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Conservatives claim Papandreou has yielded ground to Turkey by
focusing on minor issues and boosting trade rather than on the
topics dividing the two countries.
   The crucial problems, they say, are the disputes over sharing
mineral rights in the Aegean continental shelf and the divided
island of Cyprus.
   Greece wants Turkey to agree on an appeal to the World Court for
a ruling on the continental shelf problem. Turkey would prefer the
dispute to be solved through direct talks.
   Following a public outcry over his failure to raise the issue at
his first meeting with Ozal of 1,619 Greek Cypriots missing since
the Turkish invasion, Papandreou says he will certainly raise the
Cyprus problem this time.
   During Ozal's visit, Greek Cypriots living in Athens intend to
march to the Turkish Embassy and lay a wreath outside Parliament.
   Greece is disappointed that Turkey hasn't withdrawn some of the
30,000 Turkish troops occupying the northern third of Cyprus as
proof of its commitment to better relations.
   The island was divided into Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
sectors by the Turkish invasion that followed a 1974 coup aimed at
uniting Cyprus with Greece.
   Greece also has linked Turkey's application to join the European
Economic Community with Cyprus. Papandreou has said Greece would
assist Turkey's membership bid in the 12-nation trade bloc if the
Cyprus problem was solved.
   The two premiers will meet in the seaside suburb of Vouliagmeni
under tight security. The security was stepped up following
anti-Turkish demonstrations and bomb attacks against Turkish
diplomats' cars during visits in May by Istanbul Mayor Bedrettin
Dalan and Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz.

<TEXT>
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman on Saturday
opened the cartel's 83rd meeting by urging members to set aside
their differences and reach a production pact that would stabilize
the floundering oil market.
   ``Only an accord based on consensus will achieve the required
impact and send the right signals to the market,'' Lukman told the
12 other oil ministers in his opening speech at the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' regular mid-year meeting.
   The meeting began after 6 p.m. (12 noon EDT), more than three
hours late, lasted two hours, and adjourned until 10 a.m. (4 a.m.
EDT) Sunday.
   OPEC will try to decide whether to change an agreement among 12
of its 13 members to limit output to 15.06 million barrels a day.
The agreement, which was extended in December and expires June 30,
was designed to support oil prices at $18 a barrel.
   Iraq did not join in the pact, insisting on a quota equal to
Iran. The two nations have been at war since September 1980.
   Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, was elected OPEC president for
another six months in a vote taken at the start of the first
session. He assumed the post in June 1986 and has been re-elected
at every meeting since then.
   Fernando Santos-Alvite, Ecuador's oil minister, was re-elected
vice president.
   Pessimism about the possibility of the cartel reaching agreement
on a new accord has depressed the oil markets, pushing prices well
below the target.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, fell 52 cents to $15.85 a barrel on
Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, dropped
42 cents to $16.865 on the spot market.
   A Venezuela-led group has wanted to cut production to push oil
prices up while Saudi Arabia leads other OPEC members who want to
raise output or at least hold it steady to maintain the cartel's
market share.
   Industry analysts believe OPEC is so deeply divided that it will
extend its current agreement for three or six months.
   But late Saturday, Venezuela appeared to have softened its
position.
   Its oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, said, ``I am not
sure we have the unanimity to reduce the production level.
   ``Anyway, if we maintain the current level of production, I
believe that prices will start going back up'' because of an
expected increase in demand in the second half of the year.
   Saudi Arabia has wanted to increase oil output to take advantage
of that anticipated increase in demand.
   The Iran-Iraq war remains a major problem.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqhazadeh said his country
couldn't guarantee that it would continue to accept a quota, which
currently stands at 2.369 million barrels a day, if Iraq, which is
producing 2.6 million barrels a day, continued to refuse to accept
a quota.

<HEAD>Envoy Says Anti-Nuclear Law Would Shut Down U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States would close its
military bases here and end its security relationship with the
Philippines if an anti-nuclear bill became law, a U.S. diplomat
said Saturday.
   Charge d'Affaires Kenneth Quinn made the statement during a
queston-and-answer session following a speaking engagement in
suburban Quezon City. He was asked if Clark Air Base and Subic
Naval Base would still be useful to the United States if such a law
were passed.
   ``No,'' Quinn replied. ``It's the end of our security
relationship. We will be less capable without Clark and Subic, but
we'll get the job done.''
   The 23-member Senate on Monday approved a bill banning nuclear
weapons and nuclear-armed ships and planes from Philippine
territory. The bill is expected to run into resistance in the
more-conservative, 200-member House of Representatives.
   It also would have to be approved by President Corazon Aquino,
who has veto power.
   U.S. policy is not to confirm or deny the existence of nuclear
weapons in specific places.
   In his talk, Quinn said ``nuclear weapons, for all their
destructive effects, have kept peace better than anything else in
history.''
   Noting that this country has battled a communist insurgency for
19 years now, Quinn said Filipinos ``should not fear nuclear
weapons, but the increasing prospect of communism.''
   ``Filipinos have the right to be worried, but not of nuclear
weapons but of the prospects of radical communism which has
destroyed religion in several countries,'' the diplomat said.

<HEAD>Arab World To Pay $42 Million Monthly To PLO, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab leaders have promised to pay a monthly
subsidy of $42 million to support the activities of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, a Kuwaiti newspaper reported Saturday.
   The subsidy was adopted during a last week's summit of Arab
leaders, according to Al-Rai Aam.
   The newspaper said the payment is in addition to the $128
million in annual support the Persian Gulf nations earmarked for
the PLO-guided Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, it said.
   No concrete figures on financial aid for the PLO or the uprising
were given officially after the Arab leaders concluded their
emergency summit.
   The summit's main purpose was to show support for the
six-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories. PLO leader Yasser Arafat had told Arab leaders he
needed $600 million annually to keep full pressure on the Israelis.

   Jesse Jackson said Saturday he will continue
seeking delegates to boost his strength at the Democratic National
Convention, where he wants a laundry list of issues included in the
party's platform.
   Jackson, whose 1988 presidential prospects evaporated when
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis clinched the Democratic
nomination last Tuesday, announced his plan in an hour-long speech
before about 1,200 singing, cheering, applauding supporters at the
Chicago headquarters of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he
founded.
   ``We're going to Atlanta with the ability to help shape the
platform,'' Jackson said. ``Jesse is working on solidifying the
Rainbow Coalition movement and unifying the Democratic Party.''
   He said he would announce specifics of his plans within the next
week or so.
   Jackson said he would spend a significant amount of time before
the July convention pursing the support of ``super delegates,'' the
643 party leaders and politicians who received seats as delegates
because of their posts.
   Jackson has won support from just 54 super delegates, while 347
are backing Dukakis, according to The Associated Press delegate
count. The rest are uncommitted.
   The issues, which Jackson wants to become part of the party's
platform, include achieving statehood for the District of Columbia;
getting Congress to declare South Africa a terrorist state; and
establishing a program of national health care.
   Jackson again staked his claim to the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket, which he says should be offered to him because
of his second place finish in the race for the party's presidential
nomination. On Saturday, he said his experience in foreign policy
would strengthen a ticket with Dukakis.
   ``Dukakis says he wants a vice president with foreign policy
experience. Well ... ,'' Jackson said, pausing to an ovation.
   With relations eased between the United States and the Soviet
Union, the most critical foreign policy issues and conflicts are in
the developing world, said Jackson.
   ``The selection of the vice president could be used to give
someone with Third World experience and sensitivity a chance,''
Jackson said.
   Jackson said he was not interested in a Cabinet post, saying
``an appointment position is also a disappointment position. A vice
presidential position is a constitutional position from which you
cannot be fired because you're elected by the people.''
   Jackson said, however, that if he were asked to be the vice
presidential nominee, acceptance would not be automatic.
   ``It's a matter that my family must wrestle with, I must wrestle
with personally. It's a decision I will make at the time.''
   ``The fundamental question right now is our constituency has
earned serious consideration'' for the vice presidential
nomination, he said. ``Surely based upon the tone we've set, the
votes we've delivered, the elections we've won, the general mandate
we've gotten from the American people, has earned us serious
consideration.''

<HEAD>Graham Preaches as Christian Celebration Continues in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Billy Graham brought his impassioned
brand of preaching to a church packed with Russian Orthodox
believers on Saturday, but the evangelist's fire-and-brimstone
delivery failed to ignite his listeners.
   Graham's appearance was part of this communist country's
celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of the arrival of
Christianity.
   ``Some things change, some things never change,'' Graham told
the crowd gathered in the 17th-century Church of Our Lady of Kazan
at Kolomenskoye in southern Moscow. ``God never changes. Human
nature never changes.''
   ``Your liturgy is based on the Bible. And the Bible says that
the world will be shaken from time to time,'' Graham said, clearly
alluding to the social changes that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is attempting through his reforms.
   Graham, a Southern Baptist evangelist, was in Moscow as part of
the officially sanctioned celebration of the introduction of
Christianity into Russia by Prince Vladimir of Kiev in 988.
   Graham's English-language sermon was translated into Russian by
the Rev. Vladimir Sorokin, head of the Russian Orthodox seminary in
the northern Russian city of Leningrad.
   The Soviet congregation reacted coolly to Graham's sermon, only
waving their hands when he asked at one point if they were happy. A
few clapped politely as he was driven away from the church in a
government-owned black Chaika.
   ``It was strange,'' one woman told another as the worshipers
filed from the church and mingled with those who had not been able
to find room inside.
   Blue-shirted uniformed police officers were scattered at the
edge of the grounds but made no move to interfere with the
proceedings.
   Soviet authorities brutally repressed the church in the years
after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, especially under Josef V.
Stalin, jailing or killing many priests and nationalizing church
property.
   Until recently, police surrounded churches on such religious
holidays as Easter, allowing only the elderly to enter.
   Under Gorbachev, the state has returned to the church the
Monastery of the Caves in Kiev, agreed to build an old-age home for
priests, and promised to liberalize a 1929 law which sanctioned
suppression of the church.
   In another sign of relaxation, authorities on Friday released a
Russian Orthodox deacon, Vasily Shipilov, who spent 36 of his 60
years in psychiatric prisons.
   Signals that authorities will moderate constraints on the church
have aroused mixed reactions among visiting clergymen.
   Graham, who said during a 1982 visit that he thought the church
in the Soviet Union was free, this time said only that ``the people
seem to be warmer. That makes me glad,'' according to his
spokesman, Edward E. Plowman. Graham did not speak with reporters
at Saturday's service.
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York said Friday, ``I think anyone
in his right mind prays that Mr. Gorbachev is sincere and wants to
bring about a new era.''
   O'Connor, the highest-ranking American in the largest Vatican
delegation ever to visit the Soviet Union, was scheduled to attend
an evening religious vigil Saturday night.
   That service is in preparation for the celebration Sunday of one
of the holiest dates on the Russian Orthodox calendar, known as
``Sunday of All the Saints Who Shone Forth in the Land of Russia.''
   Soviet President Andrei A. Gromyko, whose prominence in the
Soviet government dates to the Stalin era, met Saturday at the
Kremlin with foreign religious dignitaries who are in Moscow for
the church millennium.
   Gromyko assured his guests that authorities were working quickly
to redraft the law on religion to guarantee greater tolerance of
believers, the official Tass news agency said.

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 Roman Catholics packed
St. Vitus Cathedral on Saturday for the consecration of two
assistant bishops, the first such appointments allowed by communist
authorities since 1973.
   Catholics seized the opportunity to show their support for
defiant Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, the archbishop of Prague and
the Catholic primate of Czechoslovakia.
   After the ceremony, hundreds of believers massed at the entrance
to the archbishop's palace, shouting ``We want religious
freedom!,'' ``Long live father cardinal!'' and ``Long live the
pope!''
   Tomasek has come under strong attack from state-run news media
this year for supporting a petition for more religious freedom,
which has been signed by an estimated 600,000 people.
   Saturday's ceremony was the first public consecration of
assistant bishops in Prague in 55 years and was marked by repeated
calls for more bishops denied by the communist regime.
   Tomasek officiated at what was a major church gathering to
celebrate the formal appointment of Jan Lebeda, the 75-year-old
vicar general of Prague and 64-year-old Antonin Liska as assistant
bishops of Prague.
   The state was represented by Minister of Education Milan
Kymlicka and officials of the state church authority, but not by
Vladimir Janku, the head of the department.
   The first churchman to speak was parish priest Karel Otcenasek
from Trmice in northern Bohemia, who was consecrated as bishop in
1951 at age 29 but was never permitted by the authorities to take
up office.
   In his address, frequently interrupted by applause, Otcenasek
assured the cardinal: ``You feel the difficulties and fears of us
all. ... The church in our country speaks in a single voice and
that comes out of your mouth.''
   In April, the cardinal wrote to Premier Lubomir Strougal urging
that the church and the authorities open a new dialogue. The offer
was rejected amid indications the Communist Party is reinforcing
its atheist drive.
   Tomasek said in his short sermon, ``We expect this to be only
the beginning of further consecrations of bishops. Nine dioceses
have been waiting a long number of years for their diocesan
bishops.''.
   Ten bishoprics in all have been reported to be vacant. Tomasek's
mentioning nine apparently has to do with one bishopric being Greek
Orthodox.
   The event was attended by bishops from Poland, East Germany,
West Germany and Austria.
   After the ceremony, papal emissary Archbishop Francesco
Colasuonno addressed the congregation in Czech, assuring the
faithful of ``church solidarity.''
   Later, the faithful lined up six deep along the short route to
the archbishop's palace, cheering church dignitaries as they were
driven by.
   They then gathered in front of the palace, shouting their
support for the cardinal and for religious freedom and singing
hymns.
   The crowd dispersed peacefully after about 45 minutes. Police
looked on but did not interfere.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity on Saturday said that massive Western loans to the Soviet
bloc could backfire without fundamental changes in the East's
economic system.
   Verity said on the final day of the three-day East-West
conference that large increases in Western lending might boost
living standards in the East ``at least for awhile. ... But such
lending does not generate the means of future repayment.
   ``There are massive systematic failings that can only be solved
by changing the system itself _ by a repudiation of rigid
centrally-planned monopolies and a move toward meaningful prices,
and decentralized enterprise,'' he said.
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, also
told the conference on East-West security that the two German
nations ``bear a special responsibility'' for reuniting Europe.
   Verity urged the East to strive for currency convertibility by
1995 so the Soviet Union and its allies could do business in
international markets using their own currencies.
   ``Currency convertibility is the necessary act for the Eastern
economies to join the world economy,'' Verity said.
   He also criticized the human rights situation in the East bloc,
especially targeting the conference host country, East Germany.
   ``Traveling to Potsdam, most of us drove through check-points in
the Berlin Wall and saw armed guards at the ready. Restrictions on
freedom of movement and conscience are still daily facts of life,''
Verity said.
   Genscher's speech marked the first time a West German leader of
Genscher's rank made an official address in East Germany.
   Genscher, who left East Germany in 1952, made several references
to World War II as well as to atrocities that occurred during Adolf
Hitler's rule of Germany.
   ``It is obvious that we Germans bear a special responsibility
for overcoming the division of our continent,'' Genscher said.
``The bitter experiences of this century prompt those nations to
keep a watchful eye on us Germans.''
   Genscher spoke out strongly for a ``common European house.''
   ``We Germans must render a major contribution to building
confidence between East and West. We want to re-activate the once
so varied and fruitful bonds between Germans and Russians. We want
to develop and deepen them with the aim of overcoming the division
in Europe,'' Genscher said.
   Genscher also praised the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and rejected any suggestion that increased East-West
cooperation could ``decouple the European allies.''

<HEAD>Kennedy Says Bush `Dead Duck' In Race, But Bush Forces Not Worried</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs to include Mondale endorsement of Dukakis.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy pronounced George Bush a ``dead duck'' in
the presidential race, even as the vice president's campaign
manager and former GOP rivals said Saturday they weren't alarmed by
his weakness in the polls.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said he is not worried yet
about Democrat Michael Dukakis' lead in the polls, saying Bush
``operates better in the underdog position.
   ``He enjoys it more,'' Atwater said. ``I don't care if we're
behind. We may be behind all along.''
   Bush and Dukakis, both of whom are assured of winning their
parties' presidential nominations this summer, stayed close to home
Saturday. The vice president took the day off in Houston, while the
Massachusetts governor was in Boston for his home state's
Democratic convention.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson also kept to home turf Saturday with an
hour-long speech in Chicago to supporters at Operation PUSH, the
civil rights group he founded. Jackson repeated his claim he should
be offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and said he
would continue gathering delegates to force the party to accept his
issues as part of its platform.
   ``We're going to Atlanta with the ability to help shape the
platform,'' Jackson said. ``Jesse is working on solidifying the
Rainbow Coalition movement and unifying the Democratic Party.''
   Atwater was attending a ``Unity '88'' conference in Denver,
where party leaders from Western states heard Bush's vanquished GOP
rivals urge them to help defeat Dukakis.
   ``It is not for the vice president to win this election by
himself,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole told the conference.
``The task is too large, the stakes are too high and the opposition
too bitter.''
   Dole, the winner of the Republican caucuses in Iowa, said he has
been wary of polls since his own loss to Bush in the New Hampshire
primary.
   When he looks at the Dukakis poll numbers, Dole said, ``I think
of New Hampshire, and I think of my pollster. God bless his soul.''
   ``I remember coming into the hotel one day, whistling `Hail to
the chief,' but I was the only one there,''' Dole said.
   But Massachusetts Democrats were crowing about the political
strength their home-state candidate was showing in the public
opinion polls, some of which have Dukakis leading Bush by as many
as 15 percentage points.
   ``President Dukakis, it has a nice ring, doesn't it?'' Kennedy
said in his speech to the state convention.
   ``Some people say don't count your chickens before they're
hatched,'' Kennedy said. ``Well, I say the Republicans have already
hatched their chicken in this campaign _ and George Bush is a dead
duck.''
   ``You have made me what I am, and I am eternally grateful,''
Dukakis told his state convention. ``Nobody has been blessed more
than I.''
   But Dukakis, who has been criticized for a lack of experience in
foreign policy, was taking heat Saturday for his suggestion earlier
in the week that the United States should move its embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
   Israel declared its capital to be Jerusalem after seizing the
eastern part of the city from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war,
but the United States and most other nations continue to keep their
embassies in Tel Aviv.
   Dukakis said U.S. embassies should be placed ``where the host
nation says its capital is.''
   Dukakis was quickly criticized by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, and on Saturday, Arab League spokesman Clovis Maksoud said
if the governor was indicating the course of his foreign policy
``then the U.S.'s future role in assisting to bring about a just
peace in the Middle East will further erode and will be seriously
jeopardized.''
   And Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek dismissed Dukakis' statement as
just election-year rhetoric.
   ``It happens every time,'' Kollek said Saturday on Israeli
radio. ``Jerusalem is a controversial issue, and therefore
everybody will try to exploit this in order to attract votes.''
   Meanwhile, Democrats drafting the party's platform clashed over
whether to include a call for raising taxes on the rich. The
proposed plank is backed by Jackson's supporters and opposed by the
Dukakis forces, who want to keep talk of raising taxes out of the
party platform.
   Michael Barnes, Dukakis's top emissary to the platform
committee, said ``The Democratic platform in 1988 is not going to
call for a tax increase.''
   ``There's no question we're going to prevail,'' said Barnes, a
former Maryland congressman. ``Bruce Babbitt is a great guy, but he
didn't win the nomination.'' Babbitt had said he would raise taxes.
   The drafting committee would hold its third and final day of
meetings Sunday on Mackinac Island, a posh resort nestled between
Michigan's upper and lower peninsulas.
   Also on Saturday, former Vice President Walter Mondale, the
Democrats' 1984 presidential nominee, announced his endorsement of
Dukakis, praising him as a ``brilliant, gifted public servant
blessed with a sense of compassion.''
   In a letter to the Minnesota Democratic convention, Mondale said
Dukakis ``is the person who can bring our party together and wage a
strong campaign based on our shared Democratic values.''

<HEAD>Trooping the Color: Queen Honored On Official Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cavalrymen and foot soldiers in scarlet tunics and
bearskin hats paraded in the center of London Saturday to honor
Queen Elizabeth II with the Trooping the Color on her ``official''
birthday.
   The queen, who is 62, celebrated her real birthday on April 21,
but the official birthday ceremonies are held on the second
Saturday of June when the weather normally is better. The sky was
overcast and there was a damp chill in the air Saturday.
   This year, for the first time since 1973, the 1,588 men of all
five regiments of the Brigade of Guards joined the parade because
all are currently based in London.
   The guards _ Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh
regiments _ are often scattered, seeing service in such places as
Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands.
   Four generations of the royal family joined the ceremony this
year, riding in coaches or on horseback to the Horse Guards Parade,
an open square in Whitehall, where the queen inspected the Irish
Guards while massed bands played.
   Each year one regiment performs the honors, marching in
intricate patterns and carrying the ``color,'' or regimental
standard.
   Elizabeth, wearing a blue coat and wide-brimmed hat, arrived in
a horse-drawn phaeton and took the salute standing on a dais. It
was the second year she had used the carriage since retiring her
horse, Burmese, which she used to ride sidesaddle for the occasion,
wearing a scarlet uniform.
   The queen's 5-year-old grandson, Prince William, was with his
mother, the Princess Diana, and his great-grandmother, Queen Mother
Elizabeth, in her carriage.
   Riding horseback was the heir to the throne, Prince Charles in
his uniform as colonel of the Welsh Guards, along with the queen's
husband, Prince Philip, a colonel of the Grenadier Guards.
   On her return to Buckingham Palace, the queen appeared on a
balcony to wave to her subjects and thousands of tourists.
   Saturday's pageantry was based on the ceremony used for guard
mounting in the 18th century and was first performed on the
sovereign's birthday for King George III. But during the 18th and
19th centuries the trooping was seldom attended by the monarch.
   In 1895, the color was trooped in the quadrangle at Windsor
Castle, west of London, and Queen Victoria took the salute from a
carriage. From that year on, a senior royal person has always been
in attendance.

   Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III
won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's endorsement on the first
ballot Saturday to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. David Durenberger.
   In his acceptance speech, Humphrey, 45, invoked the name and
ideals of his father, the late vice president who 40 years earlier
won the DFL nod and his first U.S. Senate election.
   ``As I stand here today, I'll say for the record that his vision
of America is still alive, in you and in me _ the people of
Minnesota,'' Humphrey said.
   Humphrey received 64.05 percent of the 1,323 votes cast, four
percentage points more than required for endorsement.
   Peace activist Polly Mann, 67, received 23.52 percent of the
vote, 9.42 percent was for ``no endorsement,'' and 1.63 percent was
for other candidates.
   Humphrey declared the first-ballot endorsement a great victory,
but others said he should have done better.
   ``No one ever says the DFL does things in lockstep,'' said
Humphrey, a former state senator and attorney general since 1983.
   The leader of an anti-abortion caucus took credit for denying
Humphrey, who received 808 votes, an additional 118 votes that were
cast for no endorsement.
   Leo LaLonde said his caucus members refused to vote for Humphrey
because he does not support a constitutional amendment that would
outlaw abortion.
   Prior to the endorsement vote, Humphrey asked for the delegates'
support in a voice reminiscent of his late father.
   ``I ask for your endorsement,'' Humphrey said. ``I ask that you
give us the time and the passion and the energy to make this the
great country that it will be.''
   In his acceptance speech, Humphrey sought to tie Durenberger to
the policies of President Reagan and Vice President Bush.
   ``For the future of our country, we must unite to defeat the
Reagan-Bush administration, and we must defeat their henchmen, like
Dave Durenberger,'' Humphrey said.
   Durenberger, said Humphrey, ``is part of the problem down in
Washington. He talks about Minnesota values but he votes and acts a
different way.''
   Durenberger has voted against school lunch programs, student
loans, Head Start and education funding, Social Security and
Medicare, Humphrey said.
   ``I want to invest in America's future, invest in America's
people again,'' Humphrey said.
   Durenberger is unopposed for the Independent-Republican
endorsement, which is to be made at next weekend's IR state
convention.

<HEAD>Newspaper Examines Businesses Of Jesse Jackson's Half-Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's half-brother, Noah Robinson, has
operated Chicago companies that have capitalized on programs to aid
minority businesses, but has often hired white-owned firms to do
the work, a newspaper reports.
   Robinson, 45, who faces criminal charges in South Carolina, said
Saturday that subcontracting is common in the construction industry
and contends he did nothing wrong.
   Robinson was arrested last weekend in his hometown of
Greenville, S.C., on charges that he hired someone to attack a
murder witness last Dec. 4 in Greenville. The witness, Janice
Rosemond, who survived five stab wounds, was to testify in
connection with the 1986 murder of Leroy Barber, a former Robinson
employee.
   The Chicago Tribune reported in Sunday's editions that in
several instances a company owned by Robinson was awarded contracts
aimed at minority firms but then contracted the work to others.
   Robinson, reached by telephone Saturday at the Chicago office of
his Precision Contractors Inc., said: ``We have not been found
wanting by any agency in any investigation.''
   Robinson, free on bond, also said he had no reason to harm Ms.
Rosemond.
   ``She looks at me as if I'm a fatherly figure,'' he said. ``I've
known her and her mother all their lives.''
   He maintained that authorities are after him partly to hurt
Jackson's bid for president.
   Robinson said he last saw Barber when he and Barber got into a
fight in December 1985, about a month before Barber was killed.
   ``He had enough enemies. Anybody could have killed him,''
Robinson said.
   Robinson also charged that authorities timed his arrest in
Greenville ``to make me appear to be the Achilles' heel of Jesse's
campaign.''
   He said he has not contacted Jackson recently and has not played
an active role in the campaign. ``My efforts have been strictly
that of a well-wisher,'' he said.
   Jackson has declined comment on Robinson's arrest.
   Precision Contractors was formed in 1979 by Robinson, who is
black, and Paschen Contractors Inc., a white-owned firm.
   The newspaper said state records and interviews show nearly
every aspect of the work on a granite ramp in Chicago's State of
Illinois Center, awarded to Precision under a state program for
minorities, was subcontracted to a white-owned firm, Wolverine
Marble Co. of Detroit.
   In 1979, the Metropolitan Sanitary District found that the work
on a $4.3 million minority contract obtained by Robinson-run Apache
Electric Co. and a white-owned firm, Tunnel Electric Co., was done
by Tunnel employees, the newspaper said.
   Two years later, the Tribune said, Precision got a $23 million
sanitary district subcontract for work on Deep Tunnel, a giant
pollution control project, but farmed virtually all of the work to
other firms.
   ``All general managers and construction managers contract work
out to specialty trades,'' Robinson said. ``We subcontract to other
specialty contractors, whether they be white, or black or green or
blue.
   ``If I'm a general contractor who just happens to be black, why
can't I conduct myself like other general contractors who happen to
be white?''
   The Tribune said Precision did not get minority business
contracts from the city of Chicago because city officials concluded
in 1980 that the white partners controlled the firm.
   But Robinson said the city's conclusion was wrong and Precision
successfully appealed.
   ``We are certified now,'' he said.
   The newspaper said that in March 1981, Paschen Contractors sold
its 2,500 shares of Precision to the company for $3 million.
   Frank Paschen, who retained an interest in Precision, sued two
years later, charging that Robinson had siphoned more than $1.6
million from the firm, the Tribune said. The case was settled after
Robinson paid Frank Paschen $1 million, the newspaper said.
   Robinson said the charges by Paschen were unsubstantiated and he
used the opportunity to buy out Paschen and another former partner.
``It was like a divorce,'' he said.

   China on Saturday said it would ensure the safety
of foreigners here after warning the U.S. Embassy of a possible
terrorist attack on Americans in Beijing.
   ``All foreigners in China, whether they are stationed here on a
long-term basis or have come for a short stay, can conduct their
activities here as usual and should not be worried,'' said the vice
minister of public security, Gu Linfang, in a report carried by the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   Gu also was quoted by Xinhua as saying that ``some persons
recently attempted to harm Americans in China,'' but the report
gave no specifics.
   It quoted Gu as saying, ``The Public Security Department has
already taken necessary measures in this regard, and the problem
has been solved.''
   The U.S. Embassy sent an ``urgent notice'' Thursday to Americans
living in Beijing warning of a possible attack by terrorist from an
unidentified third country.
   High-level Public Security officials informed the embassy of the
threat and told it there was Middle East involvement, but the
Chinese gave no other details, embassy officials said.
   No known incidents have occurred of attacks in China against
Chinese or foreign residents, and China has good relations with
Mideast nations which have been accused of fostering terrorist
activities.
   The embassy in years past sent out similar warnings based on
worldwide alerts against terrorists, but this was the first time
the threat was directed specifically to Americans in China, embassy
officials said.
   On Friday, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying, ``The
Chinese government always attaches importance to the security of
foreigners in China, and the security of foreigners in China is
ensured.''
   The advisory sent by the embassy warned Americans to avoid
restaurants, markets, nightclubs and other public places known to
be hangouts for Americans and other foreigners.
   An estimated 1,500 American businessmen, diplomats, students and
teachers and their families live in Beijing.
   Beijing's International School, tourist hotels and American
businesses all stepped up security measures Friday in response to
the warning.

<HEAD>Youth Movement Leads To Resignations In Soviet Academy Of Sciences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
have resigned simultaneously as authorities press a campaign to
bring new blood into the prestigious institution, Tass said
Saturday.
   The official Soviet news agency said it was the largest mass
resignation in the history of the 900-member, Moscow-based academy,
which traces its roots to Peter the Great's creation of a Russian
Academy of Sciences in 1724.
   The academicians' terms normally would not have expired until
1990. Their departure appeared clearly linked to a drive led by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to enlist Soviet scientific
apparatus in his drive for scientific and technological progress.
   That step is seen as crucial if Gorbachev's campaign for
``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, is to
succeed.
   Lev Semyonov, head of the academy's personnel department, told
Tass the scientists' mass resignation ``was prompted by a desire to
draw young and talented organizers of science into the
reorganization process more actively.''
   Among those who resigned was Anatoly Alexandrov, who was academy
president until he was replaced in October 1986 by Guri Marchuk.
Alexandrov was named a counselor of the academy's presidium, or
government body, Tass said.
   Six other men who had served as secretaries of various branches
in the academy also asked to be relieved of their duties and made
counselors ``for reasons of age,'' Tass said.
   Elections to fill the vacancies will be held before June 20,
Tass said.
   A rujuvenation process in the academy began in December, when
255 new academicians and lesser-ranking corresponding members were
elected at a two-day meeting of the academy's membership.
   Many newcomers were from 40 to 45 years old.
   New rules were put into effect last year requiring academicians
to retire at age 75.
   Semyonov said ``the renewal of personnel in the academy would go
on,'' Tass reported. He said 20 directors, three deputy directors
and 160 heads of subdivisions still hold their positions despite
their ``advanced age.''
   The academy in the past has jealously guarded its integrity even
at the risk of incurring political displeasure. It insists on
holding its elections by secret ballot, when other Soviet
organizations vote by a public show of hands.
   Physicist and human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, an
academy member, was stripped of state honors and privileges after
becoming active in the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s. But
academy members refused to oust him, and he kept his title of
academician even after being exiled to Gorky in 1980.
   In December 1986, Sakharov, 67, was allowed to return to Moscow
to resume his research work in physics.

   Risen Star romped to a 14}-length victory in the
Belmont Stakes Saturday in a runaway reminiscent of his father,
Secretariat, who became a Triple Crown champion at Belmont 15 years
ago with a 31-length victory.
   Risen Star, who also won the Preakness, missed matching
Secretariat's Triple Crown by finishing third in the Kentucky
Derby, the first of the three classic races.
   The winning margin was the fourth-largest in the 120 years of
the Belmont. Secretariat set the record in 1973, Count Fleet won by
25 in 1943 and Man O' War won by 20 in 1920.
   Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, Risen Star completed the 1{ miles
in 2:26 2-5. It was the second-fastest Belmont ever, topped only by
the American-record 2:24 raced by Secretariat.
   Winning Colors, the filly who won the Kentucky Derby, finished
last in a field of six 3-year-olds and failed in her effort to
become the first filly to win two Triple Crown races.
   Brian's Time finished third, two lengths behind Kingpost and 11\
lengths in front of Cefis. Granacus finished fifth.
   Risen Star paid $6.20, $4.80 and $2.80. Kingpost returned $11
and $3.80 while Brian's Time was $2.60 to show.
   The victory was worth a winner's share of $303,720 to Risen
Star, who also picked a $1 million bonus for having earned the most
points in the three Triple Crown races _ 11 for his third in the
Kentucky Derby and two firsts. Winning Colors also had six points
going into the race.
   The bonanza gave Risen Star a bankroll of $2,029,845 on a record
of eight wins in 11 career starts.

<BYLINE>Ghost Of Daniel Lurks In 5th District Race
^By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in 20 years, there's a
tight race in the 5th Congressional District _ to fill the seat of
the late Rep. Dan Daniel, a Democrat who voted often with
conservative Republicans.
   Both Republican Linda Arey and Democrat L.F. Payne Jr. have
tried to portray themselves as the right kind of conservative for
the district described by officials of both parties as one of the
country's most old-fashioned.
   The contest has featured broadcast and campaign-trail
mudslinging, a novelty for the district and one neither side
predicted will work when voters go to the polls in Tuesday's
special election.
   Often, the disputes have centered on what Daniel, who died last
January, would have thought of the race.
   The Arey campaign proudly pointed to an interview late last year
in which Daniel referred to her as his ``ideological soul mate.''
The Payne camp has accused Ms. Arey of trying to put words in a
dead man's mouth by parlaying that comment into an apparent
endorsement.
   Arey's campaign denies the charge.
   ``I'm sure if they had the same quote they would use it,'' Arey
campaign manager Jeff Butzke said.
   About a week before the election, Rep. Stan Parris, the 8th
District Republican, went so far as to say he was ``absolutely
conviced that if Dan Daniel were alive today he would be here
supporting Linda Arey.''
   That did not sit well with 5th District Democrats, who said
neither Ms. Arey nor Payne will ever match Daniel's superb
political ability to please people from each party. Daniel was a
lifelong Democrat who worked his way up from the textile mills yet
voted often with conservative Republicans.
   As the campaign wound down, Daniel's son, Jimmie, had harsh
words about the use of his father's name.
   ``I continue to hear and read from various sources what my
father, Dan Daniel, would be doing if he were alive today,'' Jimmie
Daniel said in a statement. ``Much of what is being said and
written is completely contrary to his view as I knew it. I think it
is unjust and insensitive for a candidate or campaign to speak as
if Dan Daniel had or would have endorsed them.
   ``The fact is, he had not endorsed any candidate for his House
seat. It was his way to seek office on his own merit, and I am sure
that he would prefer that his successor be elected on theirs.''
   Ms. Arey's latest television ads said it was time for voters to
continue the 5th District's conservative ``legacy'' of Daniel.
Payne has said that as a successful developer, he is better
qualified to handle the district.
   Each side has lined up strong partisan support.
   Ms. Arey, who formerly worked in several posts with the Reagan
administration, has the president speaking for her on radio spots.
She also lined up late-campaign appearances by former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Vice President George
Bush, who will be the Republican presidential nominee, as well as
several GOP congressmen.
   Payne has gotten the nod from the commonwealth's Democratic
establishment. Stumping for Payne have been Gov. Gerald Baliles,
Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder, Attorney General Mary Sue Terry and House
Speaker A.L. Philpott.
   Both sides have predicted a close race and observers have said
there will perhaps be a rematch in November's general election.

<HEAD>Italy's First Socialist President Dead At 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Giuseppe Saragat, Italy's first socialist president
and an easygoing man who occasionally put poetry ahead of politics,
died Saturday from a heart ailment. He was 89.
   A founder of the Social Democratic Party and a staunch
anti-communist, the former president died at his home in Rome. At
his side were his son, Giovanni, and daughter, Ernestina
Santacatterina. Saragat had been treated for a cardiovascular
problem for years.
   ``The Republic loses in Giuseppe Saragat a central figure in the
fight against fascism and Stalinism,'' said Premier Ciriaco De
Mita, leader of the Christian Democrats.
   Saragat joined the Socialist Party in 1922 and became a member
of the directorate along with Pietro Nenni. He went into exile in
Austria and then France when dictator Benito Mussolini rose to
power in 1926.
   Years later, in 1947, he broke with the Socialist Party because
he feared its leader, Nenni, was shifting too far to the left.
   He then formed the Social Democratic Party and as secretary
built it into a pro-Western and anti-communist force.
   ``In the name of liberty, he was a proclaimed enemy and always
fought against all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism,''
said Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi, a former premier.
   During his seven years as the fifth president of the Republic,
beginning in 1964, Saragat worked for reforms in housing, medical
care, education and taxation. He also presided over a period of
economic prosperity.
   When he left office in 1971, Italy again was beset by economic
problems and political uncertainty.
   Saragat was a scholar fond of Roman philosophers and relaxed
about politics.
   He once told a political leader who had waited to see him: ``I
am sorry for keeping you waiting so long, but I was engaged in a
talk with (Italian poet Salvatore) Quasimodo. Poetry should come
before politics sometimes, don't you think?''
   His political life was not always tranquil. When he returned to
Italy from exile in 1943 he was arrested because of his
anti-fascism and imprisoned by the Nazis. He escaped, was
recaptured, and escaped a second time together with Sandro Pertini,
who also later became president.
   After the war, Saragat was ambassador to France and then
president of the provisional assembly in 1946 that framed the new
constitution.
   Saragat was born Sept. 19, 1898, in Turin and obtained a
university degree in economics and commerce. He worked as a bank
clerk and for a newspaper and wrote political books under the pen
name ``Togaraso.''
   He was elected to Parliament four times and served three times
as deputy premier. Saragat supported the Socialist-Christian
Democrat alliance that governed Italy during six of his seven years
as president.
   Saragat engineered the merging of his party with the bigger
Socialist Party in 1966, but when the unified party took a beating
in the 1968 elections the two again separated.
   The Social Democrats are partners with the Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Republicans and Liberals in the governing coalition.
   Saragat is survived by his son and daughter. The funeral is
scheduled for Monday.

<HEAD>Tests Show Waste Dumped Near Nigerian Port Is Toxic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Preliminary tests show that waste secretly
dumped in eastern Nigerian by an Italian company is toxic, the
military government announced Saturday.
   The News Agency of Nigeria said Saturday that the dump site,
near the port of Koko, had become somewhat of a tourist attraction,
with Nigerians flocking to the area to see the waste.
   Earlier it was reported that security agents had sealed off the
area, 150 miles southeast of Lagos.
   Scientists urged that anyone who visited the site seek medical
tests.
   The dumping episode, the latest in a series of alleged efforts
by European and American companies to dump hazardous waste in West
Africa, has strained relations between Nigeria and Italy.
   On Friday, the government seized the Italian ship Piave in Lagos
harbor and said it would be required to remove poisonous waste
dumped in eastern Nigeria. Earlier, Nigeria recalled its ambassador
from Rome.
   Nigerian government spokesman Yusufu Mamman said Nigerians and
Italians were arrested in the case. He did not identify them.
   On Saturday, the Italian news agency ANSA, reporting from
Trieste, Italy, quoted an official of the LLoyd Triestino shipping
company, Ennio Vasta, as saying the Piave did not carry toxic
wastes.
   Vasta was quoted as saying the Piave carried food products, home
appliances, machinery and shoes and ``has nothing to do, in
absolutely no manner, with toxic wastes.''
   He was quoted as saying the Nigerians are pretending the Piave
came loaded with wastes that actually were unloaded by two smaller
ships flying flags of convenience.
   Italy's Foreign Ministry promised on Friday to cooperate with
Nigeria in determining responsiblity for the dumping.
   Maj. Gen. Ike Nwachukwu, the external affairs minister, on
Friday asked New Zealand's visiting foreign minister, Russell
Marshall, to help African nations keep developed nations from
turning Africa into a dumping ground.
   Norway, whose honorary consul general in Guinea was arrested for
complicity in the dumping of waste there, said the waste would be
returned to Norway.
   Tom Prestesulen, a spokesman for the Norwegian shipping company
Klaveness, denied that the waste, described as slag ash from
Philadelphia, was toxic. He said, ``The content of toxics are well
below approved U.S. levels.''
   Guinean authorities said the substance was killing trees on an
island off Conakry, the Guinean capital. Guinean government
employees were arrested in the dumping incident.
   On May 31, five Congolese, including three senior government
officials, were charged with plotting to secretly import toxic
waste for dumping there.

<HEAD>Book: North Wanted To Use Terry Waite To Lure Gadhafi For Bombing
Raid</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs before final graf pvs to UPDATE with report
of second North plan to kill Gadhafi.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North wanted to use Anglican church
envoy Terry Waite to lure Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi to his
Tripoli compound to increase chances Gadhafi would be killed in the
1986 U.S. attack, according to book excerpts published in U.S. News
& World Report.
   The plan was considered and rejected, and North had to be
content with drafting a White House statement to be released in the
event Gadhafi was killed, which would call his death
``fortuitous,'' according to the account.
   The book, ``Best Laid Plans, The Inside Story of America's War
Against Terrorism,'' was written by David Martin, Pentagon
correspondent for CBS, and John Walcott, national security
correspondent for The Wall Street Journal.
   It looks at the events surrounding the April 15, 1986, U.S.
bombing raid on Libya, which American officials said were conducted
in response to Libya's role in the bombing of a West Berlin disco
frequented by U.S. servicemen.
   According to the book, North, then a National Security Council
aide, planned to ask Waite to go to Tripoli on April 14 to meet
with Gadhafi. Waite, the hostage negotiator from the Church of
England, would ask Gadhafi's help in freeing the hostages in
Lebanon. Waite would then depart, leaving Gadhafi to spend the
night at his compound, the book said.
   Waite, himself now believed a hostage in Lebanon, would not be
told that he was being used to set Gadhafi up for a killing, the
book said.
   Such an assassination plot would have violated American law.
Previous published reports have said that North and others on the
National Security Council plotted the bombing Libya as a way of
assassinating Gadhafi.
   U.S. officials have said the bombing was not an assassination
plot, although they have conceded that officials ``wouldn't have
been upset'' if Gadhafi had been killed.
   The book, excerpted in the magazine's June 20 issue, also
reports that North was so eager to ``get Gadhafi'' that he doctored
the intelligence section of an ``action memo'' prepared for
President Reagan. North wanted Reagan to think that a second Libyan
raid would be more successful than the intelligence community or
the Pentagon believed, according to the excerpts, which did not
provide further elaboration.
   The bombing mission, known by the code name ``Operation El
Dorado Canyon,'' had among its targets a frogman school, a Tripoli
airfield and the compound that contained Gadhafi's military-staff
headquarters and family home. Some bombs fell on civilian areas,
and one U.S. F-111 bomber never returned, its two-man crew later
declared killed in action.
   Gadhafi was apparently unharmed, although there were rumors that
the attack had left him confused and disoriented. Libyan officials
reported that his 15-month old adopted daughter was killed and two
young sons were wounded.
   CBS reported Saturday that after Gadhafi survived the first
attack, ``North immediately came up with another plan to kill him.''
   Under that plan, North wanted to have an unidentified friendly
foreign leader telephone Gadhafi so that U.S. officials could
monitor the conversation and pinpoint his location, CBS said. That
plan, too, was rejected by administration officials, the report
said.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, has since retired
from the military and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from
the diversion of profits to the Nicaragua rebels from U.S. arms
sales to Iran. He was fired from his NSC job in November 1986, when
the diversion became public.

<HEAD>Runoff Vote For A New National Assembly Sunday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French voters on Sunday choose a new National
Assembly that either will give President Francois Mitterrand a
Socialist majority or force him to continue ``cohabitation'' with
the right.
   Five weeks after Mitterrand won re-election with a solid 54
percent of the vote over conservative former Premier Jacques
Chirac, the Socialist position appeared to be eroding and what once
was seen as a leftist landslide in the Assembly voting has become a
contest.
   The Socialists recently talked about giving away constituencies
to centrists as part of their ``opening'' to non-Socialists, but
they now are fighting for every seat and acknowledging the
possiblity of defeat.
   Despite polling fewer popular votes nationwide than
conservatives in the first round, the Socialists are given the edge
to win a majority in the Assembly because of peculiarities in the
spread of their support.
   Publication of polls is prohibited by law in the week before an
election, but unpublished surveys indicate a Socialist advantage.
   In the first round of the legislative elections on June 5, the
Socialists won 40 of the 577 seats in the Assembly and the
Communists won one. On the right, the conservative Rally for the
Republic and center-right Union for French Democracy won 77 seats
and minor rightist parties four.
   Sunday's runoffs are being held in the 453 districts where no
candidate won a majority in the first round. In addition, a first
round is being held for two seats in French Polynesia.
   In districts where no candidate won a majority in the first
round, all candidates with 12.5 percent or more were eligible for
the runoff.
   As they have done in past years, the Socialist Party and the
Communist Party agreed to support the leading leftist candidate. In
districts where the Socialist candidate was ahead, the Communist
candidate withdrew, and vice versa.
   The event of the week was the traditional right's similar deal
with the extreme right National Front, the party accused by nearly
all political leaders of being racist and xenophobic. Though
involving only a small number of seats, the left immediately seized
on the issue and accused the Rally for the Republic and Union for
French Democracy of signing a pact with the devil.
   For Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front, it's the difference
between being shut out of the National Assembly altogether and
winning some seats. For the traditional right, it could be the
difference between being in power or in the opposition.
   The Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy denied
there was any ``deal'' with the National Front.
   From 1981 to 1986, the Socialists had absolute power. In 1986,
after the National Assembly's five-year term expired, the right won
a slim majority. But because Mitterrand had two years left on his
seven-year term, the right and the left were forced into
``cohabitation,'' or power-sharing.
   The politicians hated cohabitation. But numerous polls indicated
voters liked the balance of power between the right and the left.
   Analysts said Mitterrand's score was due to his personal
popularity and not necessarily an indication French voters want a
return to leftist policies. On the other hand, his solid victory
did create a certain momentum.
   The president said recently he thought it unhealthy for one
party to have all the power in France. Nonetheless, sensing his
party was in trouble, he went on national television Thursday to
ask voters to give him a clear majority with which to work in
Parliament.
   As in the presidential campaign, not much attention has been
paid to the issues. With all of the talk focusing on the
``opening'' and the National Front, little concrete has been said
about unemployment, social security or education.
   The French may be tired of voting. Turnout during last week's
first round was 65.74 percent _ a postwar low.

   Entertainers from the Bee Gees to Stevie Wonder
denounced South African apartheid Saturday and honored jailed black
leader Nelson Mandela in the biggest charity rock concert since the
1985 ``Live Aid'' extravaganza.
   More than 70,000 fans jammed London's Wembley Stadium for the
nearly 11-hour-long concert in honor of Mandela's 70th birthday on
July 18.
   They clapped, sang, danced and reveled in the sights and sounds
of some of the world's top pop musicians playing together until
nearly 10 p.m. (5 p.m. EDT).
   Steve Sager, 29, from Los Angeles said he timed his British
vacation for the concert. ``Just being here to me is important.
South Africa is an unjust situation all around. ... People just
look at it and they turn away.''
   For a finale, American opera singer Jessye Norman sang ``Amazing
Grace'' a cappella and firecrackers shot into the sky in a circle
around the stadium.
   The finale was a change from the expected ``Nkosi Sikelele
Africa'' (God Bless Africa). The national anthem of several African
states is also regarded as the anthem of the outlawed African
National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting South Africa's
government.
   There was no immediate explanation for the change.
   Mandela, a leader of the ANC, was sentenced in 1964, along with
seven others, to life in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to
topple the government. Modeled on Live Aid's ``global jukebox,''
which raised money for starving Africans, the anti-apartheid
concert was beamed by radio and television to an estimated 750
million people in 60 countries, including the United States and the
Soviet Union, organizers said.
   Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement, which organized the concert
for Mandela, said half the expected $3.39 million in proceeds will
go to anti-apartheid activities in Britain, and the rest will go to
to seven children's charities in southern Africa. Tickets cost $45.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said it was covering the concert
not as a political but as a musical event, but it broadcast opening
comments that attacked South Africa's policy of apartheid, under
which the nation's black majority has no voice in national affairs.
   Among the performers were George Michael, Roberta Flack, Stevie
Wonder, Joe Cocker, Whitney Houston, Phil Collins, the Eurythmics,
the Bee Gees, Wet Wet Wet, Dire Straits, Hugh Masekela, Miriam
Makeba, Salif Keita and Sting.
   Kicking off the show, singer-actor Harry Belafonte called
Mandela ``the leader of South Africa's oppressed black people'' and
``a symbol of the fight against the cruel and unjust system of
apartheid.''
   ``We salute you, Nelson Mandela, and we want to see you and your
fellow political prisoners freed!'' Belafonte declared.
   The mostly youthful crowd cheered and sang ``Happy Birthday.''
Some waved placards. One showed a black hand clasped with a white
hand. Another showed a broken chain around a black man's neck.
   Anti-apartheid banners festooned the stage, which was dominated
by a huge portrait of Mandela behind bars.
   British idol Sting, the first performer, sang his hit ``Free,
Free, Set Them Free,'' and the BBC's commentator, Robert Denselow,
referred to Mandela as ``a man politically imprisoned in South
Africa.''
   Sir Richard Attenborough, director of the anti-apartheid film
``Cry Freedom,'' called Mandela ``a man of unshakeable principle
and extraordinary courage.''
   Fans danced on their seats, climbed onto the shoulders of
others, and at times the entire throng swayed to the sounds from
the stage.
   At one point, the crowd was asked to clasp hands in a Mandela
tribute. They did so, creating a sea of upraised arms.
   Scotland Yard said no violent incidents were reported during the
concert, but the police headquarters said equipment belonging to
singer Stevie Wonder was stolen. The theft delayed his appearance
by three hours and reduced his performance from a scheduled 50
minutes to about 15.
   The concert launched five weeks of rallies and celebrations in
honor of Mandela.
   South African Ambassador Rae Killen complained the BBC's
broadcast aids the ANC, which South Africa regards as a terrorist
organization.
   The BBC said it paid no money for the broadcasting rights and
was covering the concert only because it was an ``outstanding
international musical event.''
   But right-wing British politicians complained that the publicly
funded BBC was violating its duty of impartiality.
   ``The whole thing is a gigantic con trick to make people believe
the ANC is a respectable organization and not a bunch of
gangsters,'' said Conservative lawmaker John Carlisle.
   ANC President Oliver Tambo was billed by organizers as the
concert's ``guest of honor.''
   Richard Caborn, secretary the opposition Labor Party's
Anti-Apartheid Group, denied the charges of liberal bias leveled
against the BBC.

   A teen-ager who said his idle threat of a
graduation prank led to rumors of a suicide pact and a school board
decision to cancel the ceremony has been charged with underage
drinking and reckless driving, police said.
   Neal Loeslein, 18, was arrested after his car went out of
control and hit a tree early Friday, state police said. An
18-year-old passenger in Loeslein's car also was cited for underage
drinking. There were no injuries reported
   On Tuesday, the Fairview School Board canceled graduation
ceremonies scheduled for Sunday because of rumors that some
students might kill themselves on stage.
   Loslein said school officials overreacted after he threatened to
``make this graduation one that no one would forget.'' He said he
made the comment to embarrass an assistant principal whom he
disliked, not to promote violence.
   On Christmas Day, Loeslein witnessed the suicide of his best
friend, Theodore Hetz, who shot himself with a .44-caliber Magnum.
   The Fairview Ministerial Association arranged a meeting Sunday
between students and administrators to discuss the situation.

   Dozens of forest fires broke out across Israel
Saturday and police arrested at least four Arabs suspected of
setting the blazes to protest Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinian students battled Israeli
troops in the most widespread protests since the army opened high
schools last week in the West Bank after they had been closed for
four months.
   In the Gaza Strip, a 9-year-old Arab boy was hospitalized with a
skull fracture suffered when Israeli soldiers fired rubber bullets
in his direction from a distance of about six feet, said a doctor
at Gaza City's Ahli Arab Hospital.
   The doctor said the youngster was hit by rubber bullets in the
head, chest and right shoulder and three of the boy's relatives
were treated for minor rubber-bullet wounds.
   An Arab reporter said the boy was hit when soldiers opened fire
to disperse a crowd trying to stop them from beating a 17-year-old
Arab youth in Gaza City.
   The army confirmed the boy was hit by rubber bullets and said
the circumstances were under investigation.
   Firefighters have blamed Palestinian militants for setting more
than half of about 400 fires that have ravaged at least 35,000
acres of forests and farms since early May.
   David Angel of the Jewish National Fund, which manages Israeli
forests, said at least three of Saturday's major fires were caused
by arson.
   He said a helicopter crew spotted two Arab teen-agers setting a
blaze with torches and rags near the communal farm Maalei Hahamisha
northwest of Jerusalem and police arrested one of the youths.
   Another Arab was arrested as a suspected arsonist in northern
Israel, Angel said.
   Israel radio reported police arrested three residents of the
Arab village of Jisr ez Zarqua in northern Israel on suspicion of
arson. It was not immediately clear if the detainee Angel referred
to was among the three.
   In a leaflet issued last week, underground leaders of the
Palestinian uprising urged Arabs to ``destroy and burn all the
enemy's agricultural and industrial resources.''
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, about 200 students shouting
``Allahu Akhbar!'' Arabic for God is great, piled stones and
burning tires on main roads through much of the city, an Arab
reporter said.
   The students threw stones and soldiers fired in the air to end
the hour-long protest, said the reporter, speaking on condition of
anonymity. There were no reports of injuries.
   Dozens of Arab students also demonstrated in the West Bank
cities of Ramallah and El Bireh, the reporter said.
   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
protests in Hebron. He did not elaborate and said he had no reports
of student demonstrations elsewhere.
   The army closed the West Bank's nearly 1,200 schools in
February, saying they had become centers of violence. The schools
were gradually reopened in the past three weeks, and high school
classes resumed Monday.
   At least 204 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed
since Dec. 8, when the Arab uprising began in the territories that
Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   A military source said the army might reclose some schools where
disturbances persisted but had no immediate plans to shut down the
whole West Bank school system.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy said authorities detained a
man seen setting a fire near the communal farm Maalei Hahamisha
northwest of Jerusalem. Angel said police also arrested an Arab
suspected of starting a forest fire in northern Israel's Lower
Galilee region. Fires also were reported near coastal cities of
Ashkelon and Haifa.
   In Jerusalem, the attorney for Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American
advocate of civil disobedience, said Awad vowed to physically
resist efforts to deport him. Under a Supreme Court ruling, Awad
can be expelled at midnight, but Israeli officials refused to say
when he would be deported.
   Awad's Palestinian lawyer, Jonathan Kuttab, met with Awad for
about 20 minutes on Saturday.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered Awad deported in May,
saying he helped incite the Arab uprising.
   Awad, 44, has said he supported civil disobedience against
Israel but was opposed to violent forms of protest. The
Jerusalem-born Awad became a U.S. citizen during a 13-year stay in
the United States but returned to Israel in 1983 to found the
Center for the Study of Non-Violence.

   Tipplers with a thirst for treasure got a chance
Saturday to bid at an auction of bottles of scotch and champagne
recovered from a Great Lakes shipwreck 75 years ago.
   Susie Shaw bought her dad some Scotch whisky for a Father's Day
present, three bottles that had been slowly vintaging in the cool
waters of Lake Huron since the S.S. Regina went down on Nov. 9,
1913.
   ``It tastes very good,'' said Ms. Shaw of Chicago, who paid $180
for the bottles of Whyte & Mackay Scotch Whiskey and sampled some
of the lake-bed booze at a pre-auction tasting session. ``It's a
novelty, my father is a scotch drinker.''
   So far, about 300 bottles of French champagne and Scotch whisky
have been salvaged from the Regina, one of 19 ships that went down
in the great November storm.
   Several thousand more bottles still rest under 80 feet of water
roughly 3{ miles offshore from Port Sanilac, about 80 miles
northeast of Detroit, said commercial diver Wayne Brusate.
   Brusate accidentally discovered the wreck in July 1986 while
searching for a tugboat that sank in the late 1960s.
   ``I was surprised to find the cases of liquor,'' said Brusate,
of Marysville, Mich. ``Most freighters on the Great Lakes carried
coal, iron ore and tons of wheat, but this was like a general
store.''
   The Regina, a 249-foot Canadian freighter, went down with all 27
crew members during one of the worst storms in Great Lakes history.
   ``You can buy scotch anywhere, but only here can you buy it from
the lake bottom,'' said Deanna Chan, president of Freedom Marine
Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, the ship's salvagers. ``It's a
piece of our history, a collector's item.''
   About 100 people attended Saturday's auction, run by Christie's
auctioneers, at the University Club in downtown Chicago.
   Brent Albrecht, a representative of Clicquot Inc. U.S.A., bid
$85 for a bottle of 1906-1908 vintage Veuve Clicquot for the
champagne company's museum in Reims, France.
   The 60 bottles auctioned brought a total of $3,460, said Michael
Davis, vice-president of Christie's wine division.
   ``This was sort of a first for us, an experiment,'' he said.
``We are neither disappointed or ecstatic, because there's no real
track record for this. We're glad the bottles found buyers.''
   In December, the first auction of Regina artifacts in Detroit
found bidders paying $15-$35 for lumps of coal, matchsticks, and
spoons, Ms. Chan said.
   At a marine auction on Sunday in Newport, R.I., the ship's
compass, navigation lights and other nautical equipment were to be
sold.
   The proceeds will help finance further salvage operations which
are scheduled to resume next month, Brusate said.
   He estimated that only about 10 percent of the ship's cargo has
been recovered so far.
   The search will concentrate on finding the ship's safe, which
reportedly contained $86,000 in gold coins, worth at least $2
million at current bullion prices, Ms. Chan said. The gold was
believed to have been the payroll for workers building the Sault
Ste. Marie locks in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   When the salvaging work is completed, the wreck could yield a
treasure worth about $5 million, she said.

<HEAD>Speakes Says Media Doing Poor Job of Covering Presidential
Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILOXI, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said Saturday the media is doing a poor job of covering the
presidential campaign, focusing more attention on theatrics than on
issues.
   ``Voters want more meat and potatoes on the election, and the
press is simply not giving that to them,'' Speakes said. ``The
press is giving all mood music and no lyrics. The coverage is very
superficial.''
   Speakes, addressing the Mississippi Association of Broadcasters,
said the media is dead wrong on presidential handicapping.
   ``Don't ever go to the race track with a political reporter,''
he told the broadcasters.
   Speakes was President Reagan's spokesman for six years. He
recently lost his job at Merrill Lynch in the wake of publicity
generated by his admission in his book, ``Speaking Out,'' that he
had concocted quotes he attributed to the president.
   Speakes said the weakness in television election coverage is its
failure to tell voters the candidates' plans.
   ``Television news is giving a hybrid of charisma and fact,''
Speakes said, ``And that's not good enough. Too much is at stake.''
   In its coverage of Jesse Jackson, Speakes said, the media has
been ``lavishing its attention on his charisma, not his specific
plans. There is a schizophrenia in television coverage between
giving information or entertainment.''

   A committee of the 200th General Assembly of
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) adopted a resolution Saturday
calling on Israel to end its 20-year occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   The resolution said Israel has ruled the occupied territories
with a repressive policy. It also asks the United States to end aid
that subsidizes Israeli settlements in the occupied territory.
   Elsewhere at the assembly, Presbyterians began taking final
action on less controversial issues facing the denomination while
decisions were pending on major statements on nuclear war, health
care and election of a top officer.
   While the general assembly began receiving committee reports, a
four-member writing team met behind closed doors to draft a
preliminary recommendation on ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear
Age.''
   The team is working from a paper, written last year after a
five-year study, which has drawn widespread criticism within the 3
million-member denomination for its discussions of tax resistance
and the immorality of nuclear war and nuclear deterrence.
   The writing group, which was joined by the two leaders of the
originating task force, reworked the paper's lengthy policy
statements and background to incorporate changes. The report will
be presented to a subcommittee Sunday, with a report to the entire
Peacemaking and International Relations Committee expected Monday.
   The entire assembly is expected to take up the report Tuesday.
   Also Saturday, a committee recommended that Harriet A. Nelson, a
lay leader from Napa, Calif., be nominated for a four-year term as
stated clerk, the officer responsible for operation of the assembly.
   The committee, which could have nominated two people, considered
seven candidates including the current stated clerk, the Rev. James
E. Andrews, but declined to nominate him.
   Andrews was elected four years ago after serving 10 years as
stated clerk of the Presbyterian Church in the United States and
one-year as co-stated clerk after the mainly southern PCUS rejoined
with the northern church in 1983.
   Andrews and at least one other person have already said they
will be nominated from the floor. The 630 commissioners, or
delegates, are scheduled to vote Tuesday morning.
   The Christian Obedience paper has been revised to delete
corporate church support of tax resistance and other actions of
conscience against the government. However the subcommittee left in
a recommendation for a voluntary Fund for Obedience to Higher
Authority to offer assistance to resisters.
   On Friday, the 18-member subcommittee retained language in the
paper that calls nuclear war immoral. But it changed a section
labeling the theory of nuclear deterrence immoral to read ``nuclear
deterrence as an end in itself'' is immoral.
   The Rev. Arnold Come, a former seminary president who helped
write the original report and sat in on the writing committee, said
he expected some deleted portions would be restored before the
report went to the assembly floor Tuesday.
   A committee also adopted a resolution to provide all delegates
to the assembly with letters to sign and send to Secretary of State
George P. Shultz urging him to work to release U.S. and other
hostages held in Lebanon.
   Tom Sutherland, one of the Americans held hostage, is a
Presbyterian elder and president of American University in Beirut
who has been held four years last week.
   The committee also voted to distribute yellow ribbons to the
commissioners to help remember the hostages, who also include Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press
when he was taken hostage March 1985.
   Sunday's major event is a kickoff of the church's bicentennial
year celebration with a hour-long television program being beamed
by satellite around the country.
   The denomination was formed in 1983 from two Presbyterian groups
that had split during the Civil War and is almost 14 times larger
than the second-largest group, the Presbyterian Church in America.
   The assembly rejected a resolution Saturday asking that the
organization begin reunion talks with the conservative,
200,000-member PCA, which is based in Atlanta.
   In addition, a report was adopted critizing the Evangelical
Presbyterian Church, a 27,000-member denomination which the PCUSA
accused of undermining some local congregations in efforts to get
them to switch denominations.
   Commissioners approved the church's continued involvment in the
Consolution on Church Union, an effort by nine Protestant
denominations to move toward agreements recognizing each other's
sacraments by the mid-1990s.

   President Daniel Ortega on Saturday
blamed the Reagan administration for the breakdown of peace talks
with U.S.-backed rebels but said his government was prepared to
resume negotiations.
   Ortega told a group of factory workers in Managua that the
United States was seeking ``to make dust of the peace plan, to burn
it, incinerate it.''
   He claimed that rebel leaders met in Washington with Elliott
Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
several days before last week's three days of negotiations to work
out a strategy ``to kill the peace plan.''
   But he said his Sandinista government is prepared ``to continue
discussing outstanding points in the negotiating process'' with the
rebels.
   Both the Sandinistas and rebels appear to be pegging their peace
proposals on Washington's reaction after the collapse on Thursday
of the latest round of talks.
   It is believed the Sandinistas hope to achieve a peace pact with
the rebels, known as Contras, before the Reagan administration
leaves office next year. President Reagan is a strong backer of the
Contras and a peace agreement could dim if not eliminate prospects
for renewed U.S. military aid to the rebels.
   And the Contras say the possibility of a resumption of such aid
puts pressure on the government to accept democratic reforms.
   The fourth round of talks failed last week to find an end to the
war that has been waged for more than six years. Although the
Contras said there would be no further meetings, it appeared that
they left the door ajar.
   Alfredo Cesar, the head of the Contra delegation, said Thursday
as the talks broke off, ``We have reiterated our deep conviction to
looking to solutions to the conflict in our motherland in a
civilized way.''
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero was in Washington last week and was
quoted by the rebels' Radio Liberacion as saying, ``The armed road
is the only option left for democratization in Nicaragua.''
   A Contra plan submitted Thursday was described by the government
as ``irrational.'' It called on the Sandinistas to disband the
Supreme Court, revise the public security law, rewrite the
electoral laws and set up an assembly to rewrite the 1987
constitution.
   The White House put the blame for the breakdown of the talks on
Sandinista ``intransigence.'' Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Reagan administration was studying renewed military aid to the
rebels.
   Washington had backed and trained the rebels covertly or with
congressional approval since 1981. Military aid legally stopped
Feb. 29, and Congress voted down Reagan's request for more war
funding.
   The U.S. Congress last approved Contra military aid in June
1986. The Soviet bloc and Cuba support the Sandinistas.
   On the first of three days of talks last week, the Sandinista
delegation claimed the rebels wanted the negotiations to fail to
pave the way for new U.S. militlary aid.
   A cease-fire has been in effect since March 21, but both sides
have accused the other of violations.
   The Sandinistas' 80,000-member armed forces have continued to
receive Soviet military goods and it is believed the Contras, said
to number between 6,000 and 10,000, have been stockpiling supplies
and weapons during the fragile truce.
   The Sandinistas have been in power since July 1979 after
defeating the forces of right-wing President Anastasio Somoza in a
civil war.

   An 8-year-old girl who suffered the most
serious injuries among five children wounded in a shooting rampage
at an elementary school was released from the hospital Saturday,
officials said.
   Lindsay Fisher had suffered chest and abdominal wounds May 20
when Laurie Dann of neighboring Glencoe opened fire in Hubbard
Woods Elementary School in Winnetka.
   Eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin was killed, and Lindsay and four
other children were wounded. Ms. Dann, 30, also shot and wounded a
20-year-old man in a nearby home before fatally shooting herself as
police surrounded the house.
   Lindsay, hospitalized for three weeks, was the last of the
wounded to be released. She was moved out of Evanston Hospital's
intensive care ward May 26, and her condition was upgraded from
fair to good a day later.
   Riley McGee, the hospital's evening administrator, said she was
released Saturday.

   The city fire department doled out water
under police and army protection Saturday as the homes of more than
200,000 people remained cut off from drinking water because a
chemical fire polluted the Loire River.
   Thirty trucks and two trains had hauled more than 1,300,000
gallons of drinking water to Tours since Friday.
   Tours Deputy Mayor Jean Royer asked citizens not to water
gardens or wash cars and not to hoard bottled drinking water.
   Investigators tested the level of carcinogenic pollution in the
Loire after an explosion and fire at the Protex factory in
Anzouer-en-Touraine, 15 miles northeast of Tours Wednesday. The
accident injured one person and sent cancer-causing phenol and
metallic pollutants into the Brenne, a tributary of the Loire.
   Protex makes synthetic carpets and floor coverings.
   Environment Minister Brice Lalonde said the water mains to Tours
were cut off Thursday afternoon, shortly after traces of phenol
were detected in the city's drinking water.

   Rival Palestinian guerrilla factions
battled with rockets and mortars Saturday for control of two Beirut
refugee camps. Police said nine people were killed and 35 wounded
in the fourth day of fighting.
   The battle in west Beirut pitted PLO leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah guerrillas against the breakaway Fatah-Uprising faction of
Col. Saeed Mousa. Fatah is the main guerrilla faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Since fighting began Wednesday in the Bourj el-Barajneh and
Chatilla camps, 19 people have died and 95 have been wounded.
   Shell blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire shook Beirut as
guerrillas hammered each other's positions with mortars, recoilless
cannons, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns, police
said.
   They said Mousa's gunners, stationed in Syrian-controlled hills
in Lebanon's central mountains overlooking Beirut, pounded both
camps with howitzers and mortars.
   About 50 Palestinian women who fled Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh demonstrated Saturday at west Beirut's Mar Elias
refugee camp, which has stayed neutral in the clashes.
   ``What a shame. A Palestinian beats a Palestinian with fire!''
chanted the demonstrators as they reached the office of
Fatah-Uprising.
   Col. Mousa, better known as Abu Mousa, broke away from the PLO
in a Syrian-inspired 1983 mutiny against Arafat's leadership and
established his headquarters in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   The heavy clashes continued through the day, despite several
cease-fire calls by a security committee made up of representatives
of various Palestinian groups.
   The latest truce reached at noon eased the fighting, but tension
was still high.
   Police said the big guns fell silent, but sporadic exchanges of
gunfire were heard.
   Palestinian officials said 95 percent of Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh's 29,000 residents have fled the camps to live with
relatives or in makeshift homes in basements of unfinished
buildings in Beirut. Others took refuge in shantytowns in south and
north Lebanon.
   A statement signed, ``who is left from Chatilla's residents,''
appealed to the leaders of the PLO and Fatah-Uprising to try to
stop the bloodshed.
   ``We appeal to you in the names of Chatilla's patient and
steadfast children, women and elderly to intervene and work
seriously and quickly to stop this crazy shelling of our camp,''
the statement said.
   ``The shelling has taken the lives of women, elderly and
children and caused grave damage to the camp. It has become almost
impossible to walk through the camp because most of its alleyways
are blocked with rubble,'' added the statement.
   Chatilla bore the brunt of fighting between PLO guerrillas and
Shiite Moslem Amal militiamen in their three-year war for control
of the Palestinian refugee camps.
   Almost every shack in Chatilla is roofless and has gaping holes
or bullet scars from the war between the PLO and Amal, which sought
to prevent the Palestinian guerrillas from rebuilding the Lebanese
power base they lost after the 1982 Israeli invasion.
   The war ended in April 1987 after Syrian troops deployed around
the shantytowns, ending a nearly five-month Amal seizure.
   Arafat's loyalists had flushed out Abu Mousa's guerrillas from
both embattled shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting in the
last two months, despite a reconciliation effort between Arafat and
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   But the dissidents regrouped on the fringes of the two camps,
where Syrian troops are in control.
   On Saturday, a falling tree branch set off a landmine inside the
old French Embassy compound on Rue Clemenceau in west Beirut,
causing minor damage but no casualties, police said.
   The compound was abandoned after a 1985 spate of kidnappings of
foreigners and is guarded by a few French marines and Lebanese
police. They maintain mines in the embassy gardens to prevent
trespassing.

   Fifteen Western creditor countries
and Kuwait agreed Saturday to reschedule nearly $1 billion of
Yugoslavia's debts, the state news agency Tanjug reported from
Paris.
   It said the agreement involves $946 million of capital and
interest and was reached after two days of ``lengthy, exhaustive
and delicate negotiations'' with a Yugoslav delegation led by
Finance Secretary Svetozar Rikanovic.
   Tanjug said the accord will be signed soon, rescheduling
Yugoslav debts and interest due between April 1, 1988, and June 30,
1989 _ a period covered by a stand-by arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund.
   Postponement of repayments is for 10 years, with a six-year
grace period, according to the agency.
   The agreement also provides for possible medium-term
rescheduling of debts amounting to nearly $4 billion, depending on
how fast Yugoslavia carries out its economic reforms and on future
agreements with the IMF, the report said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Coca-Cola Being Investigated For Possible Bribery
In U.S.S.R</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has subpoenaed from the
Coca-Cola Co. all documents related to its 1986 sales agreement
with the Soviet Union as part of an investigation into possible
bribery, it was reported Saturday.
   The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, in their
combined Saturday editions, quoted unidentified sources as saying
the grand jury in Atlanta was trying to determine whether Coca-Cola
bribed people in the Soviet Union to get permission to sell Coke
there.
   A federal prosecutor refused to confirm or deny the report and a
spokesman for the Atlanta-based company branded any allegation of
wrongoing by Coke as ``ridiculous.''
   The newspapers said sources would not say what precipitated the
investigation, and characterized the inquiry as in its early stages.
   The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits Americans from
bribing foreign officials or political parties to get business in
other countries.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr would not discuss the report with the
newspapers. He did not return a telephone message from The
Associated Press Saturday asking him for comment.
   ``Any allegation of wrongdoing related to our business with the
Soviet Union is ridiculous. It does not even warrant a denial,''
Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson told the AP.
   He would not say whether Coca-Cola knew of any grand jury
investigation, saying the two-sentence statement was the only
comment the company would make.
   Coca-Cola in 1986 signed a six-year deal to sell Coke in the
Soviet Union. Fanta Orange, another Coca-Cola product, previously
was sold in the Soviet Union, but the 1986 agreement ended a long
period of Pepsico Inc.'s exclusive hold on the Soviet cola market.
   By the end of 1987, Coca-Cola had sold 10 million cases of Coke
and Fanta Orange in the Soviet Union, Claus M. Halle, senior
executive vice president of Coca-Cola, told securities analysts in
New York last month.
   The entry of Coke into the Soviet market culminated a
decade-long effort on the part of the soft-drink manufacturer to
make inroads in the Soviet Union.

   U.S. and Venezuelan authorities seized
a Colombian fishing boat loaded with 38 tons of marijuana in the
Caribbean Sea, police officials reported Saturday.
   The boat, bound out of Barranquilla, Colombia, was seized Friday
near the Paraguana Peninsula, about 70 miles east of Colombia, the
officials said.
   ``The Mara III boat was probably bound for one of the Caribbean
islands, with the U.S. as its final destination,'' Venezuelan
Police Commissioner Francisco Sibila said in a telephone interview.
   Sibila did not give details of the U.S. Navy intervention.
   ``We alerted the Venezuelan coast guard ships patrolling the
area that the boat was approaching our territorial waters. Our
coast guard asked for help from U.S. ships that at the time were
also navigating close to the area the Colombian ship was to pass,''
Sibila said.
   ``They (a U.S. naval ship) actually captured the boat and turned
it over to a Venezuelan P-15 coast guard ship,'' the Sibila said.
   The Colombian craft and its crew of six Colombians were taken to
military facilities of the Monjes islands and then to Punto Fijo
city, where they will probably face trial on Monday, the officer
said.
   No comment was immediately available from the U.S. Embassy in
Caracas.
   Venezuela and the United States maintain a close cooperation
that includes sharing information in the anti-drug fight.

<TEXT>
   The seven-party Afghan alliance, long
beset by internal feuding between Moslem moderates and
fundamentalists, promised Saturday to hold elections within four
months on a future government for Afghanistan.
   The elections, to be held before Oct. 15, will be held among
guerrillas in Afghanistan and refugees in Pakistan and Iran. They
will choose a council that will vote on setting up an interim
Moslem government to challenge the Soviet-backed Marxist
administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   The election decision should bury a leading cause of dissension
within the fractious Moslem umbrella organization.
   Alliance spokesman Gulbadin Hekmatyar said the decision was
unanimous.
   Ahmad Gailani, head of the moderate National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan and the man who will replace Hekmatyar as of Wednesday,
said the alliance has been divided over the makeup of the interim
government.
   ``We believe it should be referred to the people. ... Some of
our friends ... (in the alliance believe) everything should come
from the top,'' Gailani said.
   The alliance is often divided into two camps _ moderates and
fundamentalists. But on this issue, moderate Gailani and Hekmatyar,
who is considered an extreme fundamentalist, stood together in
demanding elections.
   An election commission set up months ago by the alliance will
decide the details of holding an election in the midst of a war
that goes on unabated despite the start of a Soviet troop
withdrawal. The commission has a July 1 deadline for its report.
   ``Eighty percent of Afghanistan is free. I don't see the problem
of an election,'' said Gailani.
   Aside from polling Islamic guerrillas and Afghans living inside
the war-torn country, an estimated 5 million refugees living in
Pakistan and Iran will be asked to vote. ``One third of our
people,'' are refugees, said Gailani.
   He cautioned against anticipating elections ``according to
Western ways. It's not possible.'' Gailani envisions elections that
combine the Western one-man, one-vote concept with traditional
Afghan jirgas, or councils.
   Gailani insisted that regardless of the methods employed or the
composition of this government, it is only transitional until Kabul
falls and a nationwide election can be held.
   Critics demanding elections argued against seven men making
decisions and claiming to represent the majority of Afghans. The
alliance is often split, 4-3, with fundamentalists in the majority.
   One of the latest alliance decisions taken over objections from
the moderate camp called for a boycott of attempts by U.N.
negotiator Diego Cordovez to help form a broad-based,
representative Afghan government.
   Gailani said mujahedeen leaders should at least talk to
Cordovez, who mediated at the Geneva talks resulting in the Soviet
commitment to withdraw its estimated 115,000 troops from
Afghanistan. A boycott, argued Galiani, only leaves the alliance in
the dark and dependent on second-and third-hand reports.
   Gailani foresaw few difficulties in coordinating elections among
commanders inside Afghanistan. He denied charges that mujahedeen
have begun fighting among themselves for captured weapons and
ammunition.

   Defense chiefs from Mozambique and
Zimbabwe have signed a military cooperation agreement after a
two-day meeting in Mozambique's capital of Maputo, The Herald
newspaper reported Saturday.
   The paper, owned by Zimbabwe's state-controlled Mass Media
Trust, gave no details of the pact.
   It said the defense leaders reviewed joint military operations
against guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance who are
fighting to overthrow the Marxist government in Maputo.
   They agreed to continue joint counter-insurgency efforts,
according to the report.
   Zimbabwe and Mozambique claim the rebels are backed by South
Africa's white-dominated government. South Africa denies it.
   Zimbabwe has about 12,000 military personnel in Mozambique, its
eastern neighbor, helping guard supply lines and an oil pipeline
against rebel attacks.

   Police raids in Punjab state left four
people dead, including at least two suspected Sikh terrorists.
Gunmen killed a Sikh political adviser, news reports said Saturday.
   Police also seized heroin valued at $5.25 million, found a large
cache of weapons and arrested 13 suspected Sikh extremists in raids
over a 24-hour period ending Saturday, the United News of India
news agency said.
   In another report, the agency said Charan Dass Ghai, a lawyer
and adviser to the Sikhs' Akali Dal party, was called from his home
in Moga town by two men who shot him to death.
   UNI and government-run television reported the seizure of the
heroin and listed the value, but gave no further details.
   Various news reports gave these accounts of the four deaths
during the police raids:
   Security forces killed two suspected Sikh terrorists early
Saturday in a gunfight in Shankar village in Jalandhar district. A
third suspect escaped.
   On Friday night, members of the Border Security Force killed
Swaran Singh in a shooting near the Bab Pir border outpost in
Amritsar district when he tried to cross into Pakistan and ignored
orders to halt. The reports said Swaran Singh was a close associate
of a man accused of terrorist attacks.
   A security unit fired on a group of seven people trying to enter
India from Pakistan near the Mangli border post, also in Amritsar
district, killing one. The six others fled and the patrol found a
large cache of arms and ammunition.
   Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's population of 800
million but are in a majority in Punjab. Militant Sikhs have been
fighting for a separate homeland in the state since 1982, targeting
for attack security personnel, Hindus and moderate Sikhs.
   In another development, hundreds of residents of the northern
city of Srinagar protesting government plans to raise electricity
rates battled police Saturday with rocks and crude bombs.
   News reports said at least 55 people were injured, including 40
policemen and two rioters shot by police while trying to burn a
bridge.

   The police officer whose fatal shooting
of a Hispanic man triggered violent protests earlier this week will
be sued for allegedly beating another Hispanic man in a separate
incident last month, an attorney said Saturday.
   The streets of this town remained calm for the second straight
night Saturday, but several residents said rioting could break out
again if the officer is not indicted after an investigation of the
shooting.
   Rock-throwing rioters broke windows and looted and toppled a car
Wednesday and Thursday nights to protest the shooting of two
Hispanic men by Sgt. Allen C. Fuller.
   Fuller shot and killed Carmen Coria and critically wounded
Coria's brother, Matteo, outside a bar early Monday. Fuller has
said he fired in self-defense after Carmen Coria approached him
holding a bottle. The officer has been suspended with pay pending
the outcome of the investigation.
   Matteo Coria remained in critical condition in Robert Wood
Johnson Memorial Hospital in New Brunswick, a nursing supervisor
who declined to be identified said Saturday.
   Lawsuits expected to be filed in federal and state courts next
week will charge that Fuller and other officers used excessive
force and violated the civil rights of Edwin Ramos during a drug
bust May 19, said Jack Dudas, attorney for Ramos.
   Fuller and several other officers beat Ramos, who required
hospitalization for a cracked skull and possible brain damage,
Dudas said. Police allege Ramos was hospitalized for swallowing a
quantity of cocaine, the lawyer said.
   Ramos was admitted May 28 to the county jail and held in lieu of
$15,000 bail on charges of drug possession, resisting arrest and
aggravated assault, said Officer Mark Rodziewicz of the county
sheriff's department.
   Dudas said other defendants in the lawsuits would be the city of
Perth Amboy, which runs the police department; Middlesex County,
which trains the officers; and Mayor George J. Otlowksi, who is the
police director.
   Otlowski said he knew about the Ramos case but declined comment.
   He again praised Fuller, calling him a ``man on a crusade'' who
had probably the highest number of arrests on the narcotics squad.
   Middlesex County Prosecutor Alan Rockoff said he had no
knowledge of the Ramos incident.
   Police Chief Edward Mullen did not return calls to his home
Saturday.
   Rockoff met with Hispanic community leaders Friday and agreed to
investigate the shooting of the Coria brothers and present the case
to a grand jury to halt the street violence.
   Residents said Saturday that the 109-member police force was
tainted by a few bad officers and many singled out Fuller, who they
said frequently harassed Hispanics.
   If there is no indictment, ``a real riot could break out,'' said
Frank Morales, 29. ``We don't want that to happen. We want a good
community.''
   ``He thought he was `super cop,''' said Joseph E. Gregory, 37.
``He was an accident waiting to happen.''
   ``The problem is with him, not the police department,'' said
Hector Julio, 28. ``He thinks he's something like Dirty Harry.''
   City and county officials also agreed Friday to form a
commission to investigate bias in the city and to establish a
community council to hear grievances against police.

   Michael Dukakis thanked cheering home-state
supporters Saturday for their support and received a glowing
tribute from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who said Vice President George
Bush was a ``dead duck'' in his race for the presidency.
   ``You have made me what I am, and I am eternally grateful,''
Dukakis told delegates to the Massachusetts Democratic Convention.
``Nobody has been blessed more than I.''
   Dukakis, whose official job at the convention was to introduce
Kennedy to accept the party's endorsement in his re-election bid,
opened his remarks by thanking the delegates and state officials
``for making it possible for me and for us to do what we have done
the past 15 months.''
   ``This commonwealth of ours and its people have set an example
that I'm proud of and you're proud of and that I hope will set an
example for the nation beginning in January of 1989,'' the
Massachusetts governor said.
   ``We have not only built an economic future for our people that
we can be proud of, but we have done it with sensitivity and
compassion. And that in the last analysis is the measure of us, and
of our state and of our nation.''
   For a day, the often-contentious Massachusetts Democrats engaged
in a love-fest, paying tribute to Dukakis and Kennedy, who is
seeking his fifth full term in the Senate and whose endorsement was
the only major official convention business.
   Dukakis, who noted that he was first elected to the state
Legislature the same year Kennedy began his Senate career _ 1962 _
called the senator ``our leader for many, many years'' and praised
Kennedy for his positions on issues ranging from civil rights to
national health insurance.
   He then thanked Kennedy for bringing ``his special gifts to
people'' on Dukakis' behalf during the presidential campaign.
   Kennedy, who failed in a 1980 bid to wrest the Democratic
presidential nomination away from President Carter, announced in
1986 that he would not seek the presidency in 1988, clearing the
way for Dukakis' entry into the race.
   ``President Dukakis, it has a nice ring, doesn't it?'' Kennedy
said at the opening of a speech filled with praise of Dukakis and
criticisms of President Reagan and Bush, the vice president and
certain GOP nominee.
   ``Some people say don't count your chickens before they're
hatched,'' Kennedy said. ``Well, I say the Republicans have already
hatched their chicken in this campaign _ and George Bush is a dead
duck.''
   ``Mike Dukakis is the man who did it for Massachusetts and Mike
Dukakis is the man who can do it for the United States of
America,'' Kennedy said. ``No one will campaign longer or harder
for him than Ted Kennedy.''
   The convention was held at the Boston Garden. The last major
political event there was a rally hosted by then-Sen. John F.
Kennedy on the eve of his election to the presidency in 1960.
   Dukakis was in an unusually festive mood later Saturday as he
addressed the Boston Press Photographers Association at a banquet.
   He told the gathering that before coming to the dinner he ``went
over to a Harvard boutique to pick up my speech for tomorrow.''
Bush, who went to Yale, has tried to characterize Dukakis as
elitist because of his Harvard ties.
   The photographers presented Dukakis with their annual good
fellowship award and a mock presidential seal featuring a cod in
place of the eagle on the actual seal. Dukakis, who frequently
rides the subway to work, also was given two fare tickets for the
subway in Washington.
   On Sunday, Dukakis was headed to Salt Lake City to address the
nation's mayors before returning to Boston for several days at the
Statehouse. On Monday he is to meet with congressional leaders in
Boston to discuss drug education and interdiction programs and is
scheduled to travel to Washington Tuesday morning to deliver a
speech on U.S.-Soviet relations.

   A fire caused by faulty
electrical wiring Saturday destroyed most shops and offices in the
Dominican capital's main commercial center.
   Several firemen fighting the blaze at Naca Plaza mall fainted
after inhaling the dense smoke, but police reported no other
injuries.
   Most of the mall's more than 50 business offices, shops and
boutiques were destroyed by the fire, causing several million
dollars in damage, said owners and managers.
   Officials said the blaze broke out early in the morning when an
auxiliary power generator in the Naco residential district was
turned on, following a power failure in the area.
   The fire began in the middle of the mall, which only has three
entrances leading to large walkways surrounded by shops. Firemen
were unable to reach the center of the mall before noon because of
the dense smoke.
   Firemen also had difficulty controlling the blaze due to a lack
of water and equipment such as oxygen masks and protective clothing.

   More than 150 anti-abortion
demonstrators were arrested on disorderly conduct charges Saturday
for blocking the entrance to a women's health center, police said.
   More than 200 people blocked the doors of the Women's Medical
Pavilion around 7:30 a.m., said Sgt. Frank Palsy of the Dobbs Ferry
Police Department.
   More than 150 were arrested and taken by bus to police
headquarters and other municipal buildings, police said.
   They were released within a few hours on their promise to appear
and face trespassing charges. But Juli Loesch, a spokeswoman for
Operation Rescue, the Manhattan-based group that staged the
demonstration, complained that police kept the demonstrators from
leaving to keep them from resuming their protest.
   ``We believe they are being held in preventive detention in
violation of the Constitution,'' Loesch said.
   It was unclear whether the medical office opened Saturday. In
the morning a woman who answered the phone there hung up on a
reporter without answering any questions. In the afternoon, an
answering service took calls.
   ``This is a rescue,'' Loesch said. ``We wanted to stop the
abortions that were to occur today and to offer alternative
solutions to abortion, including counseling and information on
medical care.''
   Speaking from New York, Loesch said police arrested the Rev.
Jesse Lee, pastor of the Neighborhood Church in Greenwich Village;
Thomas Herliahy, an anti-abortion activist, and Bishop Austin
Vaughan, an auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of New York.
   During the first week in May, Operation Rescue staged
anti-abortion rallies where more than 1,600 people were arrested.

   A newspaper and its reporters were singled out
for blame Saturday at a rally for supporters of a black teen-ager
who claims she was abducted and raped by white men, and reporters
responded by walking out.
   The rally organizers then banned The Associated Press and
several other news organizations from a Sunday morning church
service to be attended by the teen.
   The incident began during a tirade by lawyer C. Vernon Mason
about a Newsday story earlier this year that said the Rev. Al
Sharpton was a federal informant who wore hidden microphones to
meetings with civil rights leaders and organized crime figures.
   Mason, Sharpton and lawyer Alton Maddox have made a racial issue
of the case of Tawana Brawley, 16, of Wappingers Falls, who claims
she was abducted and sexually assaulted by six white men over a
four-day period last November.
   After initially cooperating with authorities, she and her family
have refused to participate further, charging a cover-up. Glenda
Brawley, the mother of Tawana Brawley, was sentenced to 30 days in
jail Monday for failing to appear before a grand jury looking into
the case.
   The lawyers and Sharpton say Mrs. Brawley took ``sanctuary'' at
Bethany Baptist Church in the predominantly black
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, where about 200 people
attended the rally. Mrs. Brawley was present but did not speak.
   At one point, Mason shouted, ``Tell them, (Gov.) Mario Cuomo,
how you tried to set Al Sharpton up for physical assassination.''
Mason then asked all Newsday employees to stand, and two black
reporters did.
   Security guards, reading from a list of reporters in attendance,
told the other Newsday employees to stand. All except Juliette
Fairley, 21, stood.
   One of the guards put his hand on Ms. Fairley and asked her to
stand, but she resisted.
   ``I'm standing up. She doesn't have to,'' reporter Clem
Richardson told the guards. Richardson and Ms. Fairley are black.
   About 18 reporters from other news organizations stood in
unison. When a guard said, ``Security wants Newsday reporters to
leave,'' their colleagues walked out, too, in a show of support.
   ``I left out of solidarity for reporters, black and white, who
have been covering this story honestly, aggressively and faithfully
for more than six months,'' said Lyle Harris, a Daily News reporter
who is black.
   The Rev. Porter Denson, one of the rally organizers, later said
the guard had been misunderstood and that no one had been asked to
leave. Michael Cottman, a Newsday reporter, said he had been asked
to leave.
   Afterward, Richardson and Billy House, a reporter for the
Poughkeepsie Journal and the Gannett News Service, met with
Sharpton, Maddox and Mason.
   The advisers said that because of the walkout, which Sharpton
termed ``unprofessional,'' several news organizations would be
banned from a Sunday morning church service. They were The
Associated Press, United Press International, the Poughkeepsie
Journal, Gannett News Service, The New York Times, the Daily News,
USA Today and Newsday.
   Hours after the rally, a representative of Mason called the AP
and UPI to say that Tawana Brawley would attend the service and
asked that the service be listed on the daily schedule of events
provided by the news services.
   Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams,
who was appointed by Cuomo as special prosecutor in the case, said
city police were not arresting Mrs. Brawley because ``we have no
intention of swooping in to participate in the media circus that
the Rev. Sharpton and attorneys Maddox and Mason are intending to
orchestrate.''

   The homes of 25 workers who may have been
exposed to radioactivity during an accident at a steel plant have
been checked and found free of contamination, officials said
Saturday.
   Twelve workers were decontaminated Friday after molten steel
spilled from a large ladle at the Marion Steel Co. plant and
damaged two gauges containing radioactive cesium-137, officials
said.
   Plant personnel identified 28 employees, including the 12, who
could have been exposed to the material, said Sonya Elam,
spokeswoman for the Ohio Disaster Services Agency.
   Teams from disaster services, the Ohio Department of Health, the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Department of
Energy, have checked 25 individuals and their homes and found no
contamination, Ms. Elam said. Three workers had not yet been
contacted Saturday, Ms. Elam said.
   The building in which the accident occurred has been closed
while a consulting company cleans up the site under the supervision
of Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff members, she said.
   NRC spokesman Jan Strasma said the workers were trying to cut
away molten steel after it had cooled when they came in contact
with the cesium-137.
   The contamination was limited to the heavy clothing the workers
were wearing except for one worker who received minor skin
contamination.
   ``Apparently it (the contamination) got through or around the
(heavy, insulated) glove he was wearing. He took a shower and that
took care of that,'' Strasma said.
   ``We would characterize this as a relatively minor
contamination. None of the people involved are in any danger from
it,'' he said.
   Cesium-137 is a radioactive, granular or powdered substance that
could be harmful as a result of prolonged exposure, Strasma said.
   The radioactive material was contained in a capsule about an
inch long in four gauges positioned atop a casting mold, Strasma
said. The gauges regulated the amount of molten steel poured into
the mold from the automated ladle. The contamination took place,
Strasma said, as workers tried to clean up the spilled steel.
   The NRC, which is in charge of investigating radioactive spills,
has not begun an investigation into the circumstances of the
accident, Strasma said.
   Marion Steel will hire a consultant to assist in cleaning up the
radioactive material, which will be taken to a nuclear waste
disposal site in either South Carolina, Nevada or Washington state,
Strasma said.

   Maurice Dawkins, a black businessman and
former Democrat, won the Republican nomination Saturday to run for
the U.S. Senate seat against former Democratic Gov. Charles S. Robb.
   Dawkins, 67, is the first black to run for the Senate from
Virginia since Reconstruction.
   He won a first ballot nomination over two rivals after promising
to ``put an end to the era of Chuck Robb'' in a fiery address at
the state GOP convention.
   ``They said it couldn't be done, but we did it,'' Dawkins said
after his nomination. ``They say Chuck Robb can't be beaten, but
we're going to beat him.''
   Dawkins and Robb will square off for the seat currently held by
Rep. Paul. S. Trible Jr., who is not seeking re-election.
   Dawkins, a lobbyist and retired minister who lives in the
northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., defeated Andrew
Wahlquist, a former Senate aide, and Gil Faulk, a McLean attorney,
for the nomination.
   His speech combined a thundering attack on Robb with frequent
references to God, faith and family. He ended by leading the
delegates in singing ``God Bless America,'' brining the crowd to
its feet and swinging many uncommitted delegates into his camp.
   Dawkins switched to the GOP after George McGovern won the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1972.
   He unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for lieutenant
governor in 1985.
   Robb is considered a huge favorite to win the seat. He won the
governorship by a fairly narrow margin in 1981 but left office
highly popular four years later. Virginia does not allow governors
to serve consecutive terms.
   Robb, a lawyer and former Marine who served in Vietnam, is
married to Lynda Bird Johnson, daughter of former President Lyndon
Baines Johnson.
   A number of Republican leaders said privately that nominating a
black candidate could cost the party some traditional support among
conservative white voters.
   Political analysts said Dawkins' nomination was a calculated
gamble to take away traditional Democratic support from minority
voters.
   ``They're stealing thunder from 1989,'' said Larry Sabato, a
University of Virginia political science professor. The Democratic
Party is widely expected to nominate current Lt. Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder to run for governor next year. Wilder is the highest elected
black official of any state.
   Although Dawkins is considered the underdog, he entered the
nomination contest late and has not been cast against Robb in any
polls.
   Also Saturday, convention delegates rejected a bid by a
supporter of Pat Robertson for a seat on the Republican National
Committee.
   Incumbent Flo Traywick defeated Anne B. Kincaid, who coordinated
Robertson's presidential nomination campaign in the state.
   Asked whether her defeat represented a rejection of Robertson's
followers by GOP regulars, Ms. Kincaid said, ``You're not going to
hear that from me.''
   But Mark Rozell, a political analyst at Mary Washington College,
said the vote showed ``that the Robertson people don't have as much
influence here as many people said they would.''

   About 60,000 people participated Saturday in a
march for nuclear disarmament and rally in Central Park that
brought together 200 peace, labor, religious and human rights
organizations.
   The event was the city's largest political demonstration since
1982, police said.
   The activities capped a week of activities in support of the
Third United Nations Special Session on Disarmament. The coalition
organizing the event is seeking to increase interest in abolishing
nuclear weapons by the year 2000.
   ``This is a New York event to say, `We still believe,' '' said
Peter Yarrow of the folk singing group Peter, Paul and Mary.
   Along the roads winding through Central Park were booths set up
by organizations that distributed literature, sold buttons,
T-shirts and records.
   The day's events began with a torch lighting ceremony at the
United Nations. The torch came from the Eternal Flame at the
Hiroshima Memorial in Japan.
   Those who arrived early then marched to Central Park for the
international program of cultural presentations and speeches, which
featured among others Coretta Scott King, folks singers Ronnie
Gilbert, Pete Seeger and Yarrow and Midnight Oil, an Australian
rock group.
   Leslie Cagan, national coordinator for the sponsoring coalition,
said the demonstrations can have a ``momentous effect on the
national political agenda.''
   The coalition is calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons,
self-determination for all nations, an end to military intervention
and a shift from military buildups to global economic development.
   Police officials said the crowd was the largest at a
demonstration in the city since 250,000 people attended the United
Nations' Second Special Session on Disarmament in 1982.

<HEAD>Justice Department Studying CIA Employees' Sale Of Rare Stamps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is evaluating the case
against a group of CIA employees who took 86 rare misprinted stamps
from their office and sold them for thousands of dollars, a
department spokesman said Saturday.
   Justice Department spokesman Tom Stewart said the agency's
public integrity section had received the case and that ``they deal
in bringing criminal charges, if necessary.''
   ``I would not want you to think that something is imminent,'' he
said.
   The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that the
Justice Department was considering bringing criminal charges
against the nine CIA employees, who discovered the rare stamps in
the agency's supplies and sold them.
   The Post quoted unidentified intelligence and Justice Department
sources as saying the CIA completed an internal review of what
stamp collectors call the discovery of ``the CIA invert'' and
turned the case over to the Justice Department for possible
prosecution.
   The public integrity section is debating whether to bring
charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against
the employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 $1 stamps bearing an
upside-down candlestick with a sheet of stamps that did not have
the rare error, the newspaper said.
   Each member of the group kept one of the stamps and they sold
the 86 remaining stamps in 1986 to a New Jersey dealer for
thousands of dollars. Their identities were never made public.
   A CIA spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call
Saturday about the case.

<TEXT>
   Police here have won permission to use
hollow-point bullets on a trial basis, outraging critics who say
the bullets inflict far more serious wounds than conventional
ammunition.
   ``We're very disturbed,'' said Joel Maliniak, a spokesman for
the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. ``These
bullets are designed to cause as much bodily harm as possible. They
cause greater ripping, tearing and death.''
   Hollow-point bullets mushroom to the size of a dime upon impact
and have the force of a punch to knock a person down, said police
spokesman Cmdr. William Booth. They are far more likely to stop a
suspect than round-nose bullets that can pass through someone's
body, he said.
   Police Commissioner Bert Boeckmann said statistics show that
hollow-points cause no more damage than round-nosed bullets and are
less likely to pass through someone's body and ricochet.
   ``We're getting so many instances of bullets going through
people and striking another person,'' Boeckmann said. ``We're all
convinced this is an improvement. I see it as something that's
safer, by far.''
   The Police Commission approved use of the bullets for a one-year
trial period on May 31, said commission President Robert Talcott.
   Public protests blocked an attempt by police Chief Daryl Gates
in 1980 to adopt hollow-points, which are used by the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department and other law enforcement agencies
nationwide.
   Critics said they were not notified the issue would be on the
commission's agenda May 31 and said they only learned of the
decision Friday from a Los Angeles Herald Examiner reporter.
   ``We would have lobbied against it,'' said Michael Zinzun,
chairman of the Coalition Against Police Abuse. ``We'll see if we
can take legal action for a moratorium and stop it.''
   The city is not expected to have the new ammunition available
until September, but an interdepartment bulletin advises officers
they may purchase the bullets at their own expense at local gun
stores.

<TEXT>
   Spanish naval authorities immobilized the
Greenpeace ship Sirius at Ibiza when it tried to interfere with the
entry of a U.S. aircraft carrier at nearby Majorca island, port
officials said Saturday.
   They said the steering gear of the 152-foot Sirius was sealed
off by Spanish officials soon after the craft arrived at this
Mediterranean Balearic island port on Friday.
   Navy authorities told the captain, Ed Engels, that the Sirius
was to stay in Ibiza until further orders and could not set sail or
use its rubber rafts, according to the port officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Crewmembers of the USS Dwight David Eisenhower carrier turned
water hoses on anti-nuclear protesters in four rubber dinghies
launched from the Sirius who tried to stop the warship from
entering Palma port on Thursday.
   Xavier Pastor, a Greenpeace official, said in a communique
Thursday the environmental organization was protesting the Spanish
government's allowing nuclear weapons into its territorial waters
in violation of a March 1986 referendum.
   Green peace claims the carrier is equipped with nuclear
armaments.
   It is U.S. policy not to confirm or deny whether a U.S. ship has
nuclear weapons.
   Spaniards voted in 1986 to retain membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization with the conditions that Spain be free
of nuclear weapons, the U.S. military presence be reduced and
Spain's armed forces remain outside the integrated NATO military
command.
   Pastor said a Spanish navy official and two sailors were on duty
aboard the Sirius and national police kept watch on the ship from
port.
   ``Nobody informed us on the cause of stopping the ship,'' he
said.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
confirmed that Greenpeace had ``attempted to interfere with the
docking'' of the carrier but said it anchored successfully without
damage or injury to either side.

   A task force of 1,000 police officers set out
a dragnet for street gang members again Saturday night after
arresting 661 people and seizing drugs and weapons the previous
night.
   The sweeps, major skirmishes in what Police Chief Daryl Gates
calls a war on ``the rotten little cowards,'' followed the release
of a department report showing gang slayings had risen 20 percent
this year.
   ``We're going to do it again and again,'' Gates vowed at a
briefing.
   Most of the task force was concentrated in the south-central and
harbor areas, where a total of 327 people were arrested, police
said. Of that number, 138 were gang members, police said.
   Elsewhere, there were 147 arrests in the San Fernando Valley,
105 in the West Bureau's area and 82 in the Central Bureau's area.
Police said more than half of those arrested were gang members.
   ``There were definitely a lot of rock (crack) cocaine arrests,
some arrests for possesion of narcotics for sale, and there were
numerous weapons confiscated, including an AK-47 assault rifle,''
said Lt. Jim Tatreau.
   Those arrested for serious crimes were held at city jails while
those picked up on lesser charges were released.
   The new police report cited 96 gang-related killings in the city
this year through the end of May. In the same period a year ago
there were 80.
   In all of Los Angeles County there have been 138 gang-related
killings this year. In 1987, gang slayings totaled 387 countywide.
   The sweep, which began Friday afternoon and ended early
Saturday, was the largest since April. Similar anti-gang sweeps
have involved several hundred officers at a time in recent weeks.
   ``We don't want the public to think we've gone away, so we'll
run these periodically to reassure them,'' said Deputy Chief
William Rathburn. ``We're throwing out the big net.''
   The last time 1,000 officers were out in force against gangs was
April 8 and 9, when Mayor Tom Bradley ordered them to ``take back
the streets'' and Gates declared war on ``the rotten little
cowards'' who leave bystanders dead and wounded with their
trademark ``drive-by shootings'' from cars.
   That task force, dubbed Fly the Flag, netted 1,453 arrests
during its two days.

<HEAD>Doctors Treating Medicare Patients May Be Rated</HEAD>

   More than 300,000 physicians who treat Medicare
patients may be rated in a federal government study on the quality
of their patient care, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that the
proposed federal budget that takes effect Oct. 1 includes funds for
preliminary work on the study.
   The study, which would take several years to complete, would
rate doctors by name and the results would eventually be made
public, the Times said.
   ``We plan to measure the performance of individual physicians by
seeing how well their patients do,'' said Dr. William L. Roper,
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration in the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``There are differences in the quality of care given by
physicians and hospitals,'' Roper said. ``We can measure those
differences, and that information should be conveyed to the
public.''
   Factors that could be used in rating doctors include such things
as mortality rates, speed of recovery and complexity and severity
of illnesses, he said.
   The study would be similar to one done by the federal government
on mortality rates of nearly 6,000 hospitals and a forthcoming
study on the quality of care in 15,000 nursing homes, the newspaper
said.

   Giuseppe Saragat, Italy's first socialist president,
died at home Saturday from a heart ailment. He was 89.
   A founder of the Social Democratic Party and a staunch
anti-communist, he joined the Socialist Party in 1922. He went into
exile in Austria and then France when dictator Benito Mussolini
rose to power in 1926.
   Years later, in 1947, he broke with the Socialist Party and
formed the Social Democratic Party as a pro-Western, anti-communist
force.
   During his seven years as the fifth president of the Republic,
beginning in 1964, Saragat worked for reforms in housing, medical
care, education and taxation.
   Saragat was born Sept. 19, 1898, in Turin and obtained a
university degree in economics and commerce. He worked as a bank
clerk and for a newspaper and wrote political books under the pen
name ``Togaraso.''
   He was elected to Parliament four times and served three times
as deputy premier. Saragat supported the Socialist-Christian
Democrat alliance that governed Italy during six of his seven years
as president.
   Saragat engineered the merger of his party with the bigger
Socialist Party in 1966, but when the unified party took a beating
in the 1968 elections the two again separated.
   Saragat is survived by his son and daughter.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Growing Coca to Find Ways to Destroy It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal scientists are secretly growing coca as
part of an effort to learn how to eradicate the plant from which
cocaine is derived, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that the
project has been kept secret because federal officials fear drug
dealers or others might threaten the research program or its
personnel.
   Researchers are looking for a reliable chemical or biological
means to destroy coca in South American fields, the source of most
of the cocaine now reaching the United States.
   The best prospect is a herbicide called tebuthurion,
manufactured under the trade name Spike by Eli Lilly & Co.
Environmentalists have expressed concern that the herbicide could
be hazardous to the environment where coca is grown.
   The coca-growing project began about two years ago, according to
the Times, which ran photos of plants in a greenhouse near
Washington. A reporter viewed experiments, including the processing
of coca into cocaine.
   The newspaper agreed not to publish the identity of the
researcher who granted access, the site of the research complex or
the federal agencies involved.
   The project included several hundred coca bushes that were
raised from seeds ``flown in from South America in diplomatic
pouches,'' the researcher told the Times. Four varieties of the
plants are being grown, and researchers have found that herbicides
that kill one variety may not work against others.
   ``Coca is very tough stuff,'' the researcher said, pointing out
that a herbicide-treated stalk with brown and withered leaves was
growing back.

<HEAD>Study: Smokers Have Other Bad Health Habits Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men who smoke a lot are just as likely to be
overweight as non-smokers, according to a government study that
found heavy smokers to snack a great deal and subject themselves to
a variety of other health risks.
   While smokers generally tended to be less likely than
non-smokers to be overweight, that wasn't true for men who puffed
35 or more cigarettes daily, the National Center for Health
Statistics reported.
   ``I was surprised by that,'' Charlotte A. Schoenborn, of the
statistics center, said Friday.
   ``It may be just a consumption-oriented lifestyle, smoking a lot
and eating a lot, for heavier persons,'' she suggested in a
telephone interview.
   The report also said that smokers are more likely than
non-smokers to sleep less than six hours daily, to skip breakfast,
to be physically inactive and to drink more.
   People tend to put their health at risk in a number of different
ways, and the report found ``more risk-taking behavior and less
attention to the healthier practices of life'' among smokers, said
Schoenborn.
   ``Among male smokers, overweight was related to the number of
cigarettes smoked daily, but not in the expected direction,'' the
report said. ``Prevalence of overweight among males smoking 35
cigarettes or more daily (27.2 percent) was similar to that of
males who had never smoked (28.1 percent).''
   By comparison, 19.4 percent of men who smoked 15 or fewer
cigarettes daily were overweight.
   For women, the overweight rate was 24.9 percent for those who
had never smoked. Among women smoking more than 35 cigarettes
daily, 19.7 percent were overweight, while the rate was 19.3
percent for those smoking 15 or fewer cigarettes.
   The male group found most likely to be overweight, however, was
former smokers, at some 30 percent.
   For women, 23 percent of former smokers were overweight, more
than for smokers but fewer than those who had never smoked.
   Overall, smokers tended to snack less than non-smokers,
Schoenborn said. But heavy smokers consumed more.
   Some 39.3 percent of men and 37.6 of women who never smoked
reported snacking daily. But for folks who smoked 35 or more
cigarettes daily _ well over a pack and a half a day _ the snacking
rate was 42.5 percent for both sexes.
   For those smoking less than 15 cigarettes daily, 34.7 percent of
men and 32.7 percent of women snacked daily.
   The report, an analysis of the 1985 National Health Interview
Survey, is based on interviews with 91,351 people. It is to be
repeated in 1990.
   While the data in the report were collected three years ago,
Schoenborn said that health statisticians ``don't think the
relationships (among these factors) change a lot in that period of
time.''
   Other findings included:
   _About one-fourth of smokers reported sleeping six hours or less
daily, compared to 21 percent of non-smokers. Almost one-third of
the heavy smokers sleep less than six hours.
   _Skipping breakfast was more common among smokers. More than
one-third of current smokers said they never ate breakfast,
compared with 18 percent of those who had never smoked.
   _About 22 percent of smokers said they were less physically
active than their contemporaries, compared with 17.2 percent of
never smokers. Smokers also tended to choose less active leisure
activities than non-smokers.
   _Heavier smoking was associated with heavier alcohol-drinking.
About 13 percent of smokers were classified as heavier drinkers,
compared with 3.6 percent of those who have never smoked.

   Jacqueline Bliss finally attended her high
school senior prom, with her daughter as her date, two decades and
three children after she quit school to support her mother.
   Sonya Bliss, 20, a senior at Hope High School in Providence,
pulled up at a hotel with her mother in a gray Cadillac limousine
Thursday night, both of them in lace dresses.
   Mrs. Bliss, 41, had never been to a prom. She left high school
to support her mother, and went back to school to obtain a high
school equivalency diploma.
   ``My mother asked me who I was going with to the prom,'' Sonya
said, ``and I told her, `None of your business.' I finally told her
on Mother's Day. She cried.''
   ``I felt so good inside for a daughter to think that way,'' Mrs.
Bliss said.
   Family members chipped in to rent the limo and buy the corsage
and prom tickets. But finding the dress wasn't as easy.
   ``She wanted me to wear something with bows, like a Cinderella
dress,'' Mr. Bliss said with a laugh. ``I told her it wasn't
appropriate. I'm too old for that.''
   They settled on a long, black lace dress.
   ``She felt I'd be embarrassed in front of the other kids to
bring my mother,'' said Sonya, who is graduating after five years
in high school. ``I could care less what they think. I love her and
that's what matters.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan says the U.S.-Soviet treaty
to abolish medium-range nuclear missiles will work despite his
announcement he won't be bound by Senate restrictions on how to
interpret the already ratified accord.
   Reagan's announcement Friday that he would disregard the
conditions drew an angry response from Senate Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd and Sen. Sam Nunn. The two lawmakers said the
president accepted the language when he and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev exchanged the instruments of ratification at the
Moscow summit.
   But Reagan said his objections should not have any practical
effect on carrying out the treaty, and that any questions about
interpretation should be able to be resolved ``in a spirit of
mutual accommodation and respect.''
   Reagan said he was stating his objections to protect the
constitutional powers and responsibilities of the president.
   The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty provides for the
elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with a range
of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   At issue is an amendment attached by the Senate to the
resolution of ratification that bars future administrations from
changing the U.S. interpretation of the treaty without prior Senate
approval. The Senate ratified the treaty May 27.
   The Democratic-sponsored measure arose from a fight with Reagan
over his interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
The administration had claimed that the longstanding interpretation
of the ABM agreement was too narrow, and should be broadened to
allow realistic tests of components of the administration's Star
Wars antimissile system.
   Reagan spelled out his concern in a written statement issued at
the White House after he departed for a weekend at Camp David. He
said the Senate-passed provision ``apparently seeks to alter the
law of treaty interpretation.''
   He said the measure would give primary weight to executive
branch statements to the Senate, above other sources which
international forums and U.S. courts would consider in interpreting
treaties.
   ``It subordinates fundamental and essential treaty
interpretative sources such as the treaty parties' intent, the
treaty negotiating record and the parties' subsequent practices,''
Reagan said.
   He said the administration ``does not take the position that the
executive branch can disregard authoritative executive statements
to the Senate, and we have no intention of changing the
interpretation of the INF treaty which was presented to the Senate.
...
   ``Nonetheless, the principles of treaty interpretation
recognized and repeatedly invoked by the courts may not be limited
or changed by the Senate alone, and those principles will govern
any future disputes over interpretation of the treaty,'' Reagan
said.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., countered: ``The issue is whether any president
may subsequently reinterpret treaty provisions in ways contrary to
the shared understanding between the executive and the Senate at
the time the Senate gave its consent.
   ``The president accepted the condition when he exchanged the
instruments of ratification,'' Byrd said.
   Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who was involved in crafting the
restrictions, also objected to the president's statement, saying,
``The treaty, including this conition, is now the supreme law of
the land, and the president can no more change it with a letter
than he can change any other law with a letter.''
   The INF treaty, approved on a vote of 93-5, will require that
the Soviets destroy 1,752 missiles while the United States
eliminates 867, including both deployed and non-deployed weapons.
   In addition, the treaty includes the most intrusive and
stringent verification procedures in arms control history. The key
verification feature provides on-site inspection, both on a regular
basis and through challenges by each side.

<TEXT>
   Democratic platform writers are
trying to forge common language on such issues as drugs and civil
rights before tackling foreign policy and deficit questions that
could divide the Dukakis and Jackson camps.
   The party's drafting committee resumed work today on this scenic
island resort.
   When the panel broke Friday, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jesse
Jackson's platform adviser, complained to reporters: ``It is going
too slowly. You don't know what differences you have until you get
down to cold language.''
   But Rep. William Gray III, who is chairing the drafting effort,
said he wanted the 16 panel members to get acquainted and actually
write the document themselves, not ``rubber stamp something that
falls from on high.''
   Gray said afterwards, ``I heard a real strong consensus on the
issue of drugs, wanting ... a very strong statement on education,
and an even stronger statement on civil rights.''
   Gray, from Pennsylvania, said he was in no hurry to put anything
on paper before the Democrats head home Sunday.
   A draft is needed by June 25-26, when the full 186-member
Platform Committee meets in Denver for the first time, he said.
   ``This process begins in Mackinac and it's going to go through
Denver ... and all the way to Atlanta, because you don't have a
platform until it's approved by the entire convention,'' said Gray,
chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. opened the
Mackinac meeting with an appeal to write a document that speaks to
American families in their kitchens, not to special interests. Kirk
then departed.
   Both the Dukakis and Jackson camps were not satisfied with a
2,000-word blueprint penned by Theodore Sorensen, once John F.
Kennedy's speechwriter.
   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman representing
Dukakis, said the platform needs to spell out how the Democrats
will deal with AIDS and the homeless.
   Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, one of the drafters, said, ``There
should be a plank in this platform that says no person will sleep
on the streets of America on grates or on park benches any cold
night.''
   Norton, former chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, said: ``We have made no decisions about what will go to
the floor. We're trying to get so we can draft the first word.''
   Asked about reports that Jackson was getting conflicting advice
on what demands to press and how hard to fight, Norton said she
knew of no rifts, but added, ``I have to tell you, he keeps his own
counsels and makes up his own mind and everybody else really trails
behind.''
   The Sorensen paper, styled as a declaration by ``We the people
of the Democratic Party,'' denounces ``voodoo economics,'' condemns
``South Africa's hateful apartheid, government-sponsored
terrorism,'' and mentions in passing the need ``to find more homes
and food for those who are homeless and hungry ... and to find more
aid for those who have AIDS.''
   Norton said Sorensen's language on South Africa was ``one of the
better parts of this document,' but still needs strengthening.
   ``The motherhood issue of this campaign has been drugs. There
probably is more the American people would like to have us say
about drugs,'' said Norton, suggesting a call for appointment of a
Cabinet-level drug czar and mobilizing the Coast Guard and military
resources in the fight.
   James B. Booe, secretary-treasurer of the Communications Workers
of America and one of the drafters, said the Democrats need ``a
platform that any Democrat can run with instead of from,'' not ``a
legislative laundry list.''
   Booe said the platform should not ``get us tangled up with too
many specifics.''

<HEAD>Congressional Panels Reviewing Alleged Drinking Incident at
Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Allegations that the manager of a northwestern
Ohio nuclear power plant was ``disruptive'' in the control room
after drinking at a New Year's Eve 1986 party have come under
investigation on Capitol Hill, officials say.
   Officials of Toledo Edison Co., the utility that operates the
Davis-Besse nuclear power plant near Toledo, said, however, that
their own investigation showed the manager was capable of carrying
out his responsibilities despite his drinking.
   John Scheibel, staff director for the House Interior
investigations subcommittee, said Friday the panel's review of the
incident at Davis-Besse is in its early stages.
   ``We're just taking a look at it preliminarily,'' Scheibel said.
   A congressional source who spoke only on condition of anonymity
said the House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee also
has been reviewing the alleged incident for a couple of weeks.
   In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is wrapping up
its investigation into the allegations, according to NRC spokesman
Jan Strasma.
   Strasma said the NRC initially had accepted the findings of the
investigation by Toledo Edison, but started a new review last July
after the agency's resident inspector received more information
from plant employees.
   Toledo Edison found that the plant manager had been drinking
before arriving at the control room, but concluded: ``It is clear
that the individual was in fact fully fit for duty. Accordingly, no
disciplinary action is recommended.''
   Davis-Besse, about 20 miles east of Toledo, was shut down for 18
months after a June 9, 1985, incident in which two main and two
backup feedwater pumps failed. Operators restarted the pumps and
kept the reactor safely covered with cooling water. Since then, the
utility has spent about $180 million to upgrade the plant.
   Strasma said the plant was in the process of starting back up
the evening of Dec. 31, 1986, when the manager was called to the
site to check progress.
   ``The allegation was that this manager had been drinking and he
was disruptive in the control room,'' Strasma said.
   He said Toledo Edison submitted a report on the incident to the
NRC on Feb. 19, 1987. The report stated that the manager had been
at a New Year's Eve party at which he had consumed alcohol and that
when he later went to the control room, he was outspoken and
argumentative, Strasma said.
   The report quoted a person in the control room as characterizing
the manager as ``angry and briefly outspoken'' but that the person
did not think it surprising or inappropriate.
   While the utility's report substantiated that the manager was at
the plant shortly after drinking alcohol, it said the allegation
that his behavior was distracting was subjective and not
substantiated.
   Toledo Edison spokesman Richard Kelly said the utility
thoroughly investigated the matter and could find nothing to back
up the allegation that the manager had been unfit for duty.
   Strasma said the manager currently retains his position with the
utility.
   The probe was taken over last October by the NRC's Office of
Investigations, which reviews possible wrongdoing by licensees,
said Strasma, who added that a report on the incident was being
written.

   House investigators are pondering whether to
recommend impeaching U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of
Mississippi, who is serving a five-year prison sentence for lying
to a federal grand jury but is still drawing his $89,500 salary.
   Nixon refused to testify during two days of impeachment hearings
which ended Friday, but his lawyers claimed he was the innocent
victim of ``big prize fever'' among overzealous prosecutors eager
to put a federal judge behind bars.
   Defense attorney David Stewart told the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights that Nixon ``has
committed no crime and has engaged in no impeachable offense.''
   But former federal prosecutor Reid Weingarten said Nixon was
``aggressively lying'' to a grand jury when he denied he discussed
a drug smuggling case involving the son of a wealthy Mississippi
investor with whom he had business dealings.
   Weingarten said Nixon had a ``sweetheart deal'' with the
investor, Wiley Fairchild, who had sold the judge three profitable
oil well properties for bargain prices in 1980. Nixon paid $9,500
for oil and gas rights and reportedly netted $55,000 from the deal.
   Nixon has testified that the transaction was legitimate and that
he made no promises of return favors for Fairchild.
   Although he was accused of discussing the drug charges against
Drew Fairchild with the elder Fairchild and a former Mississippi
prosecutor, Nixon insists that he never talked to anyone about the
case.
   He also says the questions posed during his grand jury
appearance were ambiguous.
   Nixon, 59, a federal judge since 1968 and chief judge of the
southern district of Mississippi for the past six years, is serving
a five-year prison sentence at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.
   The Supreme Court denied Nixon's appeal of his perjury
conviction last January. He can continue to hold office and draw
his salary, however, unless he resigns or is convicted at a Senate
impeachment trial.
   Before Nixon entered prison in March, the Judicial Conference of
the United States, the chief policymaking body of the federal
judiciary, reported unanimously to House leaders that
``consideration of impeachment may be warranted'' in Nixon's case.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the Judiciary
subcommittee that conducted impeachment hearings, said his panel
would leave the record open for further comments in Nixon's case
until June 14.
   Shortly after that date, Edwards said, the panel will decide
whether to recommend impeachment by the full House.
   A separate Judiciary subcommittee headed by Rep. John Conyers
Jr., D-Mich., ended three weeks of impeachment hearings Thursday on
federal judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, who was acquitted of
bribery conspiracy in 1983.
   Hastings' fellow judges charged that he actually committed the
crime and tried to conceal his involvement by lying under oath and
fabricating evidence at his trial.
   Neither Hastings nor Nixon testified at their impeachment
proceedings.
   The only other federal judge to be indicted while in office was
Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada, who was imprisoned for tax evasion.
The Senate convicted Claiborne of ``high crimes and misdemeanors''
in October 1986 and removed him from the federal bench.

   Customs authorities have discovered more
than 400 pounds of gold in luggage belonging to Gurkha soldiers of
the British armed forces, officials said.
   Customs officials said Friday's haul was the biggest ever of the
precious metal in the Himalayan kingdom.
   A chartered cargo flight of Royal Nepal Airlines brought 168
boxes of goods belonging to the Gurkhas who are serving in the
British army and based in Hong Kong. Officials found 428 pounds of
gold in the boxes.
   About 1,000 pieces of gold were found in boxes belonging to one
soldier, Rajendra Gurung, officials said.
   Gurkhas are a member of the Rajput people and hail from the
mountains of Nepal. They are known for their fighting prowess.

<HEAD>Judge Says Couples Must Stop Hiding Identities In Divorce Filings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge says he will refuse to
accept divorce papers filed only under the initials of couples, but
a colleague says the judge should respect their wish for privacy.
   ``If people are too ashamed to let the world know that they are
getting divorced, they should stay married,'' Judge Margarito Garza
wrote in a memo to 148th District Court Clerk Oscar Soliz.
   Divorce petitions are public record and appear regularly in many
newspapers. Initials in some cases are used to obscure the
identities of couples.
   Garza asked Soliz to call the new policy to the attention of
anyone who is filing a divorce suit.
   Judge Joaquin Villarreal of the 347th District Court said he
disagrees with Garza's stance.
   A divorce ``is a personal matter between husband and wife,''
Villarreal said. ``If the two parties don't want the public to know
they are getting divorced, it's fine with me.''
   Soliz said he cannot refuse to accept such a case if the
petition is in order, and that cases are assigned randomly by
computer.
   In initials-only cases assigned to Garza's court, Soliz said he
will ask attorneys to modify the papers to fit with the judge's
specifications.

   Japan is tightening control over its ports of entry
and exit to prevent terrorists from passing through, Foreign
Minister Sosuke Uno said.
   Several suspected Japanese terrorists have been arrested in
Japan and abroad in recent weeks, and an attack in Naples, Italy in
April is believed to have been carried out by Japanese radicals.
   Uno on Friday told the Japan National Press Club that Western
nations participating in this month's summit in Toronto would
discuss coordinating security efforts to ensure an incident-free
Summmer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
   ``We must make the Seoul Olympics succeed,'' Uno said. ``It will
be a topic of discussion at the summit.'' The Games are scheduled
to open in the South Korean capital in September.
   Members of the radical Japanese Red Army, which carried out
numerous terrorist acts in the 1970s, have been arrested in recent
months. The latest suspect was arrested this week in Manila and was
extradited to Japan. Because some traveled or planned to travel to
South Korea, authorities suspect they may have been planning to
disrupt the Olympics.
   Uno said Japan was intensifying control over its border points
to prevent terrorists from entering or leaving.
   The foreign minister also said Japan would host a symposium on
international crime including terrorism, narcotics and organized
crime later this month.

<HEAD>Court Declines To Allow Aliens to Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government must extend its
amnesty deadline for illegal aliens who briefly left the country, a
federal judge ruled Friday, but refused to allow ousted aliens to
return to the United States.
   Both the attorney general and the group representing the aliens,
Catholic Social Services, Inc., said they will appeal the ruling by
U.S. District Court Lawrence Karlton.
   Karlton, in an eight-page order, ruled that aliens living in the
U.S. who left the country briefly without permission from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service should be allowed to apply
for amnesty through the end of Nov. 30, a six-month extension of
the deadline.
   Karlton also ruled that illegal aliens who lived in the U.S.,
then left the country and were caught and deported when they tried
to return should not be allowed to come back.
   The order, covering 50,000 to 100,000 people nationwide, affects
those who left the country after Nov. 6, 1986, when the alien
amnesty law took effect.
   Karlton's decision was prompted by a lawsuit filed by Catholic
Social Services, the California Rural Legal Assistance and other
immigrant-rights groups.
   The suit took issue with the definition of the words in the
immigration law, ``brief, causal and innocent'' departures.
   The phrase by Congress was interpreted by the INS to mean trips
of less than 30 days for a legitimate purpose with INS permission,
and that those who left the country without permission would not be
eligible for amnesty.
   The lawsuit contends that many aliens who hurriedly left the
country for non-criminal reasons, such as dealing with family
emergencies, were improperly denied amnesty eligibility when they
returned.
   The appeal of the ruling is expected to be filed next week in
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Premier Ozal To Pay Historic Visit To Greece</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal will become the first
Turkish prime minister in 36 years to go to Greece when he flies
there Monday on a historic visit to improve ties between the
archrivals.
   His trip was viewed as unlikely to produce any breakthough in
major disputes dividing the two Aegean countries, but as one
high-level Turkish official remarked, ``The visit in itself is a
major achievement.''
   The last Turkish prime minister to go to Greece was Adnan
Menderes, later executed after a military coup. He paid a visit in
1952.
   For Ozal, 61, the trip is the realization of a goal declared
years ago. He said after coming to power in 1983 that he was
extending an olive branch to Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou and
was willing to meet him ``anywhere, any time.''
   He suggested that Turks and Greeks put off trying to solve major
conflicts and first establish a dialogue aimed at building
confidence, with cooperation in areas such as tourism.
   Ozal was the architect of Turkey's 1980 economic recovery
program, but was considered a novice in diplomacy at the start of
his term.
   The road to Athens opened when Papandreou, having rejected any
negotiations for seven years, pulled a surprise switch and agreed
to meet Ozal in Davos, Switzerland. At the meeting last January,
the two accepted a formula for improving relations founded
basically on Ozal's initial offer.
   The two NATO allies came to the brink of war in March 1987 over
oil exploration rights in the Aegean Sea, an event generally
believed to have given an impetus to dialogue.
   In Davos, Ozal and Papandreou declared their intention to avoid
war and decided to set up two committees, one political and the
other economic and technical, to start a process of negotiations.
   Since then the committees have each met once and Turkish Foreign
Minister Mesut Yilmaz has visited Athens, setting the stage for
Ozal's visit.
   In a memorandum the two sides pledged to reduce tensions in the
Aegean, cooperate in fighting terrorism and drug smuggling, and
refrain from provocative statements.
   Mayors of Athens and Istanbul exchanged visits. Greek Culture
Minister Melina Mercouri visited Turkey on a goodwill mission.
   Greek university presidents were invited and feted in Turkey,
and Turkish business people went to Athens to inquire about joint
ventures.
   Yet, the most intractable of their disputes _ over the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus _ still overshadows these modest
gains.
   Turkey boycotted a European Economic Community meeting in April
to protest the mention of the Cyprus problem in the opening
statement, a mention insisted upon by Greece, a full member of the
EEC.
   One key reason Ozal is out to improve ties with Greece is his
known desire to make Turkey a full member of the trading bloc by
the turn of the century.
   Many Turks still express apprehension about the Athens visit,
arguing that Ozal will come under pressure to make concessions on
Cyprus.
   Cyprus is divided into southern Greek and northern Turkish
sectors, where Turkish Cypriots declared independence in 1983. The
split came after Turkey invaded in 1974, prompted by an
Athens-backed coup on Cyprus.
   An estimated 20,000 Turkish troops guard the boundary dividing
Greek and Turkish Cyprus.
   Greek policy demands that these troops depart prior to a Cyprus
settlement. Turks say troop removal can only follow a settlement
which will protect equal political rights of Turkish Cypriots, one
fifth of Cyprus' total population of 750,000.
   In a recent interview with Turkish daily Milliyet, Ozal
declared, ``Not a single man can be withdrawn as long as there is
pressure on us.''
   He said he and Papandreou agreed to keep the Cyprus problem out
of the process of reconciliation, but conceded the issue will most
likely be raised ``privately'' in their talks.
   The other major problem, conflicting claims on the Aegean Sea,
is more complicated, but Turks hope that as a problem just between
themselves it can be more easily solved given time and good will.
   The Aegean sea is dotted by 3,000 Greek islands, many just a few
miles off Turkey. Turkey objects to militarization of the islands,
saying that is against international treaties.

<HEAD>Wright Says GOP Using Charges To Deflect Sleaze Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright says he's confident
the ethics committee inquiry into his financial dealings will show
he has done no wrong, but Republicans aren't waiting to make
political hay out of his troubles.
   Wright, D-Texas, says the charges against him never would have
been raised had the Republicans not needed an issue to deflect the
sleaze issue from their presidential candidate, George Bush.
   ``I have absolute confidence that the committee will find that
no rule of the House has been violated,'' Wright said. ``I don't
think there's any question but that they're politically motivated.''
   Wright said Friday he had underestimated the amount to which a
speaker could become a political target. But if Attorney General
Edwin Meese III and other Reagan administration officials hadn't
themselves been in ethics trouble, ``I don't think there would have
been a formal charge and all this fanfare,'' he said.
   The ethics committee, consisting of 12 members equally divided
between the two parties, unanimously voted to begin an inquiry into
six possible violations by Wright. They included:
   _Contacting Egyptian president Anwar Sadat on behalf of a friend
and financial associate when the Camp David accords threatened the
friend's Middle East oil interests.
   _Intervening with federal officials on behalf of another Texas
oil company which might have had some financial relationships to
the speaker.
   _Whether Wright's campaign financed publication of a book for
which the speaker earned $55,000 in royalties.
   _The use of a Capitol Hill staffer and office funds to help with
the drafting of the book.
   _The use of a Fort Worth condominium, owned by the family of a
business partner, as his Texas home without having to pay a monthly
rent.
   The committee was silent on whether it planned to hire an
outside counsel to handle the case, as Republicans were demanding.
   Wright unleashed a media blitz on Friday to refute the
allegations in the investigation even before they were announced at
mid-day. He spent nearly two hours answering questions from print
and broadcast reporters and released documents and a long narrative
account of his actions.
   ``My goal, and just about my only professional goal in living at
this point, is to be a good and effective public servant,'' Wright
asserted in the conclusion of his narrative.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who triggered the ethics committee
actions by filing a formal complaint, said he hoped the probe would
show that Wright ``is an essentially decent man who was sloppy'' in
his business dealings.
   But he added, ``I think having Jim Wright third in line to be
president and having Jim Wright with the powers of the speakership
is very, very dangerous to the processes of this country.''
   In Houston at a Texas state GOP convention, national party
chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the charges against Wright would
give Republicans a ``level playing field'' in the fall election.
   ``If the Democrats are going to ... raise some kind of a sleaze
factor ... they've got to realize that people who live in glass
houses shouldn't throw stones,'' he said.
   In a statement released in Denver, where he was presiding over a
Republican Party unity conference, Fahrenkopf said:
   ``The mounting questions underscore the need for the House
ethics committee to establish and report the facts to the American
people. However, more is required. Nothing less than a public
investigation directed by an outside counsel will satisfy America's
right to open and honest government.''

<TEXT>
   A French investigating magistrate has issued an
international arrest warrant for Alois Brunner, one of the last
major Nazi war criminals still at large. He is believed to be
living in Syria.
   Brunner, 76, Adolf Eichmann's right-hand man, was commander of
the Drancy transit camp from which thousands of French Jews and
Resistance members were deported to concentration camps or
extermination centers.
   The arrest warrant was issued Friday by Judge Claude Grellier
and follows a complaint filed Dec. 4, 1987 accusing Brunner of
crimes against humanity, specifically the kidnapping and murder of
minors.
   French lawyer and Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld has entered the
case as a civil party representing an organization called the Sons
and Daughters of the Jewish Deportees of France.
   Klarsfeld, along with his wife, Beate led the successful battle
to have Klaus Barbie, known as the Butcher of Lyon, brought to
France from Bolivia in 1983. Barbie was convicted of crimes against
humanity last July and sentenced to life in prison. France no
longer has a death penalty.
   Brunner was tried and convicted in absentia in 1954 for war
crimes and sentenced to death. That sentence is no longer valid
because the 20-year statute of limitations has expired. However,
there is no statute of limitations for crimes against humanity.
   The charges against Brunner involve the arrest of about 200
children, which the Sons and Daughters group says was carried out
July 20, 1944, and their deportation to the gas chambers at
Auschwitz in Nazi-held Poland.
   The Klarsfelds in 1982 said they had found Brunner in Syria.
Austria, Poland and West Germany have previously asked for his
extradition, but the Syrian government has never acted.

<NOTE>Eds: Late-starting GOP conference continues today, but lede

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush, the Ivy League
presidential candidates from Harvard and Yale, are striving to
educate America's voters about each other's liabilities.
   The game of political one-upmanship escalated when Dukakis cried
foul over Bush's new attack strategy aimed at exposing the
Massachusetts governor as a left-wing liberal.
   Dukakis told reporters in Boston Friday that the vice
president's game plan is ``a losing strategy.'' Bush, appearing at
a Republican Party ``United '88'' conference here, retorted, ``I
won't be deterred from telling the truth.''
   While Bush and Dukakis engaged in long-distance insult-trading,
setting a likely tone for the general election campaign between the
two virtually certain nominees, Jesse Jackson was complaining that
too much has been made of what he wants as the runner-up to Dukakis
in the Democratic competition.
   Jackson, taking a working vacation at a Southern California
resort, complained that such questions about his ambitions are
``demeaning, disrespectful and contemptuous.''
   And on Mackinac Island, Mich., Democrat platform writers voiced
confidence that the desires of both Dukakis and Jackson can be
accommodated. Party chairman Paul Kirk, however, warned against
producing a document that would amount to ``the Yellow Pages _ an
ad for every organized group.''
   Bush, chafing under heavy Dukakis criticism in recent weeks
about the vice president's performance in the Reagan
administration's handling of the drug problem, went on the attack
Thursday in a speech to the state Republican convention in Houston.
   He charged Dukakis with concealing a leftist-leaning political
orientation with ``moderate tones'' and with being born of the
``Harvard Yard boutique'' school of liberalism.
   Dukakis received an undergraduate degree in political science
from Swarthmore before graduating from Harvard Law School. He also
has many advisers with Harvard ties. Bush received an undergraduate
degree in political science from Yale.
   Bush said Friday he wasn't making a class argument against the
Massachusetts governor. Instead, he said, he was trying to say that
Harvard is ``a kind of philosophical enclave. ... I see this as a
philosophical cult normally identified with extremely liberal
causes.''
   Yale, on the other hand, is ``so diffuse,'' he said. ``There
isn't a symbol. ... Harvard boutique to me, at least, has the
connotation of liberalism and elitism.''
   Dukakis refused to engage reporters in a discussion of his
political roots, although his campaign had said in advance of the
Bush speech Thursday that they expected a ``mudslinging'' strategy
by the Republican.
   Asked to respond Friday to Bush's attack, Dukakis said: ``I
don't. I'm going to campaign on the issues. I'm going to talk about
the future.''
   Asked if he would bring up Bush's Yale background, the governor
said: ``I'm really not interested. I don't think the American
people are interested. I think it's a losing strategy.''
   For his part, Bush was offering no apologies in his speech
before the heavily partisan crowd of western state Republicans in a
Hyatt Regency Hotel ballroom.
   He said that Dukakis and Jackson ``have been out there dumping
on me for six months. They can dish it out, but now let's see if
they can take it.''
   Four of Bush's vanquished GOP rivals shared the stage with the
vice president, urging Republicans to unify behind the ticket this
fall.
   Bush was warmly greeted by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont
and former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. Pat Robertson
sent a letter saying he could not make the meeting, but that he
thought Bush had ``earned and deserves'' the support of his
conservative followers.
   Said Haig: ``Michael Dukakis is a candidate of radical and
dangerous change. In Third World affairs, he is the reincarnation
of George McGovern.''
   Jackson told reporters in California he did not think his
supporters would turn away from the Democratic ticket if he is not
on it.
   ``They're not given to trauma easily,'' he said. ``My
constituency will have a broad view of the many considerations.
They do not have a fixation on one position. There is much to be
considered.''

   U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci said
Friday anti-American riots in Seoul are an ``internal'' South
Korean problem and do not threaten U.S. forces there.
   ``I got no sense whatsover that our forces were in any jeopardy
in South Korea. On the contrary, I received nothing but warm
hospitality everywhere I went,'' Carlucci said at a news conference
a day after arriving here from visits to Japan and South Korea
following the Moscow summit.
   ``One would have thought that if there were any risk to our
soldiers, there would be some demonstrations against me, and there
were none,'' he said. ``I think what we're seeing is limited in
scope. It's an internal Korean matter and not appropriate for me to
comment on.''
   In Seoul on Friday, riot police firing tear gas blocked
thousands of radical students from marching to communist North
Korea for reunification talks. The radicals claim the United
States, with its 42,000 troops in South Korea, enforces partition
to rule the South. Protests throughout Seoul were bitterly
anti-American.
   Carlucci was in South Korea for annual U.S.-South Korean
security consultations at which security for the 1988 Summer
Olympics also was discussed.
   Of his talks with his Soviet counterpart at the Moscow summit,
Carlucci said he hoped real gains had been made between the
superpowers, but the United States should not let its guard down in
the face of friendly gestures from the Soviet Union.
   ``We have yet to see perestroika (restructuring) impact the
Soviet military establishment,'' Carlucci said.
   ``It would be certainly premature and the height of folly now
for us to throw up our hands and say all is well while the Soviet
military machine continues to roll on.''

   Jazz composer Herbie Hancock says he's
happy to share the limelight of his current concert tour with
musical ally Chick Corea.
   ``I guess this is the first time my band has toured with another
name act, but it's Chick, so it's like family,'' said Hancock, who
is in the middle of a monthlong, 23-city tour, currently at the
Pacific Amphitheatre in Orange County.
   ``One night we'll be his opening act and the next night he'll be
ours,'' Hancock said. ``He's a friend, so there's no competition.''
   Hancock said he's only scratched the surface of his new career
direction _ film scoring _ although he already won an Academy Award
for the score of one of the eight films for which he wrote the
music, the 1986 ``Round Midnight.''
   His latest film score was for the street gang movie ``Colors,''
starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall, which some feared might
ignite real-life violence.
   ``I don't understand that controversy,'' Hancock said. ``The
movie didn't even show a viewpoint. But the controversy sure helped
at the box office.''

   The fifth-grade class at Gifford Elementary
School here planted a tree in honor of U.S. speedskater Dan Jansen,
chosen as this year's school hero.
   ``There have been lots of honors, but none that's a living
tribute,'' said Jansen's mother, Gerry, after the maple was planted
Thursday in front of the school at a ceremony she and her husband,
Harry, attended.
   Jansen, of nearby West Allis, decided to remain in the
speedskating competition at the Winter Olympics in Calgary,
Alberta, after his sister, Jane, died of leukemia the day the races

   Jansen, who was considered a gold medal favorite, fell in two
races and did not win a medal. He was visiting his fiancee in
Canada and did not attend the tree-planting ceremony.

   An anti-apartheid group will picket an
upcoming concert by singer Linda Ronstadt because she failed to
promise not to perform in South Africa, a spokesman for the
organization said.
   Ron Wilkins of Unity in Action said the singer received $500,000
for six concert performances in South Africa in 1983.
   Wilkins contends Miss Ronstadt violated a 1981 United Nations
cultural boycott against the country aimed at denying it
world-class entertainment until its system of racial separation is
abolished.
   Wilkins said the singer's manager, Ira Koslow, told him Miss
Ronstadt has no intention of returning to South Africa, but is
unwilling to sign a pledge not to do so, as the group is seeking.
   Neither Koslow nor Miss Ronstadt's publicity manager, Paul
Wasserman, could be reached for comment Friday.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis says Republican George
Bush has adopted a ``losing strategy'' for the fall campaign and
the vice president's rival says he will focus on the issues despite
Bush's personal attacks.
   Dukakis, his party's certain presidential nominee, also said
Friday that it was ``much too early'' to ask him about potential
running mates.
   And, taking a position likely to feed Bush's criticism of
Dukakis' foreign policy views, Dukakis said he would move the U.S.
Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem if he was elected and
Israel continued to recognize Jerusalem as its capital.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, today was to address a
friendly audience at the state Democratic Party convention, being
held to formally bestow an endorsement on the re-election bid of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   On Friday, after having a quick lunch with former President
Jimmy Carter, Dukakis responded to Bush's statements a day earlier
that Dukakis was an elitist whose views were far from the political
mainstream.
   At first, he offered a blunt ``I don't'' when asked how he
planned to respond to Bush's attacks. He then went on to say: ``I'm
going to campaign on the issues. ... I'm going to talk about the
future.''
   Later, Dukakis, who attended Harvard Law School and has many
advisers with Harvard ties, laughed when asked if he would point
out Bush's own Ivy League background. The vice president attended
Yale.
   ``I really am not interested,'' Dukakis said. ``I don't think
the American people are interested. I think that's a losing
strategy.''
   Democratic rival Jesse Jackson has been pressing Dukakis to
offer him the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Dukakis, asked if Jackson
met his criteria for the spot, said it was ``much too early'' to
respond.
   ``The process has just begun,'' Dukakis said. ``This will take
several weeks.'' Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas, a law
school classmate of the governor, is heading the search, which
Dukakis has said he hopes to complete prior to the Democratic
National Convention in mid-July.
   Dukakis spent a good portion of a media briefing dancing around
the question of whether he would move the embassy in Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem, which Israel considers to be its capital.
   Dukakis said U.S. embassies should ``go where the host nation
says its capital is,'' adding later that the policy was a ``regular
rule of diplomatic courtesy.'' Later, when pressed for a direct
answer on whether he would move the embassy if Israel maintained
Jerusalem was its capital, Dukakis said: ``If Israel determined
that that's where it wants its capital then that is its capital.
I'd put our embassy there.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, interviewed Friday by
NBC-TV, said moving the embassy to Jerusalem ``would ruin'' Middle
East peace efforts.
   Shultz who said it would be inappropriate for the United States
to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital because the city is
regarded as occupied territory subject to disputes between Israel
and its Arab neighbors.
   Dukakis said he and Carter had a ``terrific'' meeting and talked
about ``lots of things.'' He refused to be more specific. He said
he expected Carter to campaign for him in the fall. Bush frequently
tries to tie Dukakis to the last Democratic administration.
   On Sunday, Dukakis was to travel to Salt Lake City to speak to
the nation's mayors, kicking off a week in which he will focus on
drug and anti-crime programs.

   A Soviet delegation has spent two weeks
in capitalist Sweden studying the social welfare system to see
whether any aspect could be used to reform the Soviet economic and
social system.
   ``We are not here to copy, we are here to find efficient methods
that, within our socialistic system, are the most efficient for our
social development,'' Vice Finance Minister Viacheslav Senchagov
said Friday as the delegation ended its visit.
   Sweden is a capitalist country, but its taxes are among the
world's highest. Tax income finances welfare programs which health,
child care and education free for everyone and guarantees liveable
retirement pensions.
   Soviet economic experts and bureacrats examined the Swedish
retraining programs, the tax system, the labor exchange and
cooperative companies. They also visited factories and farms.
   Delegates said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
``perestroika'' policy was now in its most active stage. It was
most important to increase production while safeguarding social
goals, they said.
   Perestroika means restructuring in Russian and is a buzzword for
Gorbachev's program which seeks to reform the Soviet economy and
social system.
   ``We are looking for a tax system to stimulate innovation and
how to use taxes to get work collectives to use the socialist
property in the best way,'' Senchagov told a news conference.
   Speaking through an interpreter, he said the danger of
perestroika was that it might create economic inequality. In
Sweden, incomes are equalized by a progressive taxes that takes as
much as 78 percent in the top tax brackets.
   The delegation arrived to Sweden on May 29 at the invitation of
social democratic Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson. It was scheduled
to return to Moscow today.
   Another member of the group, Leonid Abalkin, Director of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute for Economy, described the
Swedish model as dynamic and efficient.
   ``The social motives and humanistic goals in Sweden ... are very
attractive to us, and we sympathize with the system,'' he said.
   Asked why the Soviet Union had started turning to capitalistic
countries for ideas Abalkin said ``there is nothing peculiar about
the fact that we after 70 years turn to other countries.''
   ``The Socialistic system is open for all positive things in the
world,'' he said.
   Head of delegation, Anatoliy Miliukov, said Sweden's extensive
labor exchange and retraining programs, which include government
subsidies to companies that give workers time off for study, were
of great interest.
   He said that as a result of perestroika the number of officials
at various ministries are being cut down sharply and that in Moscow
alone the number of employed in half of the ministries had been cut
by 30-40 percent.
   ``We have retired a lot of these people, others have been
transferred to other institutions, for instance to research,''
Miliukov said.

<HEAD>Institute Warns Radical Measures Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary needs radical reforms and faces
years of social upheaval before its economic and social crisis will
end, a private Hungarian think tank said.
   In a separate discussion on state television, a top Communist
party official revealed that Hungary's economic woes meant that its
defense commitments to the Warsaw Pact were not increased this
year, and will not grow in real terms through 1990.
   In a report Friday, the state news agency, MTI, summarized what
it said were the results of a report by the Financial Research Co.,
a former state institute that went private last year after
Communist authorities threatened to close it for its critical
analyses.
   The new analysis, entitled ``Reports From the Tunnel,'' said
Hungary ``now faces a criticial situation externally and
internally'' because reforms begun in the late 1960s did not go far
enough in dismantling centralized state control over the economy.
   ``Production is growing ever more slowly, the situation of small
business has become less stable, the inflationary pressure remains,
the `self-restraint' by companies about price increases will not
last long and the efforts to curb budgetary spending have not been
successful,'' said Istvan Csillag, deputy head of the research
company.
   Inflation has already touched 18 percent in Hungary this year,
and many experts expect it to go higher.
   MTI quoted Csillag as saying that the currently favorable
assessment of Hungary's prospects abroad will soon change unless
more reform is adopted.
   With a gross hard currency debt of $18 billion, Hungary is
highly dependent on Western assessments of its performance and
reforms to gain further credits from governments, banks and the
International Monetary Fund.
   MTI quoted the Financial Research Co. as saying significant
changes were needed, including a shift to satisfying overall market
demand rather than selected markets and new forms of ownership.
   If such changes were implemented, the report said, ``then we may
be out of the present critical situation in five to eight years'
time.''
   But it noted that this would only occur ``at a price of the
upheavals that structural change will entail.''
   MTI quoted the firm's manager, Marton Tardos, as saying it was
necessary to create popular support for changes even if they
entailed unemployment and other unpopular reductions in the social
support mechanism.
   Until the mid-1980s, unemployment was unknown in Hungary, which
like other Soviet bloc nations touted full employment as one of the
achievements of Communism.
   Hungary and other east European nations have now admitted that
people employed in unprofitable state enterprises will have to face
at least temporary job loss as state subsidies are shifted from the
loss-making firms to more profitable enterprises.
   One area of Communist budgets that so far has seemed immune from
cuts has been defense.
   But Politburo member Miklos Nemeth indicated on Hungarian
television Thursday night that Hungary's economic woes have also
affected military spending.
   He said 1987 defense spending, including costs for Ministry of
Interior militia and for clothing and housing soldiers totaled
about $1 billion.
   The real value of defense spending was not increased in 1988,
Nemeth said, declining to give figures.
   Warsaw Pact commitments also were not increased as in the past,
but kept the same in real terms, Nemeth said. Again, he provided no
figures.

<TEXT>
   A man's land is his kingdom, but the law stepped
in when Larry Wilburn's commercial lion hunts expanded to
government marshland in East Texas.
   ``We don't want to put constraints on what he can do on his own
property,'' said Ed White, spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. ``But we are concerned with safety.''
   Wilburn says he has led paying hunters on six lion safaris this
year at his 400-acre island about 40 miles east of Houston. He
won't say where he got the lions.
   Government officials became involved when two lion carcasses
were found on government land across a roughly half-mile-wide
shallow river from Wilburn's isolated island. The government land
is intended for a reservoir and was being managed by the corps.
   At least one lion was believed to have been released, hunted and
skinned on government property, said Charles Craddock, a corps
ranger who usually monitors compliance with grazing and oilfield
leases.
   Federal officials were unnerved by the idea of lions roaming
free followed by hunters with high-powered weapons on land usually
used by duck hunters and nature buffs.
   ``I had a long talk with him,'' Craddock said. ``He indicated to
me that he was not going to hunt any more lions down there.''
   Opposition to such lion hunts has come from as far away as West
Germany, said Patricia Mercer, executive director of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Houston.
   ``People are appalled that something like this could happen,''
she said. ``It's becoming a common problem across the U.S. with a
surplus of lions, who breed well in captivity.''
   In the absence of regulations specifically forbidding lion hunts
on private land, authorities fined Wilburn $125 for disposing of an
animal carcass on government land and conducting a business for
profit on government property, White said.
   In addition, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ranger who
accompanied Craddock to Wilburn's taxidermy shop April 29 fined
Wilburn $110 for not having a license to mount migratory wildfowl.
   The lions Wilburn used probably were bred in the United States,
said Jim Stinebaugh, senior resident U.S. Fish and Wildlife
enforcement agent for south Texas. He added, ``once they're here,
they can be bought, sold, killed, whatever.''
   Under state law, even African lions are not considered wildlife
resources and therefore are not protected from hunters, said Phil
Evans, a regulatory coordinator for the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department.
   The lions were brought to the island in cages, released and then
tracked across the private property in hunts lasting as little as
20 minutes, Wilburn said. His price list for the hunts ranged from
$2,500 to $3,000.
   ``Once that lion is released, there is no catching him back
again,'' he said. ``I'm obligated to kill him. I can't have the
liability of a lion running around.
   ``They made it sound like we were releasing lions in that part
of the country, hoping we'd find them,'' Wilburn said. ``When the
cat was released, it never left our sight.''
   Wilburn said his customers had no preconceived notions about the
hunt on the island, which is covered by low vegetation.
   ``They knew they weren't in Africa, they knew they weren't
hunting for a free lion,'' he said. ``If they wanted that, they
could go to Africa.''

<HEAD>Use of Herbicide Halted Except In Limited Instances In Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says the
last two manufacturers of a weedkiller that can cause birth defects
must stop selling the herbicide, but the agency will allow
short-term continued use on some food products in three
Northwestern states.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas on Friday announced the agency
has reached a settlement with the two makers of the herbicide
dinoseb that would halt most current sales and distribution of the
product.
   But the government has said Cedar Chemical Corp. and Drexel
Chemical Co., both near Memphis, Tenn., can sell their existing
stock for use during the rest of this year on dry peas, lentils,
chickpeas and green peas in the states of Washington, Oregon and
Idaho. The remaining stock may be used in 1988 and 1989 on berries
in Washington and Oregon.
   EPA spokesman Al Heier said Thomas decided to allow limited
continued use of dinoseb into 1989 although it can cause birth
defects and poses a hazard to men's ability to have children. Heier
said there is no substitute herbicide to treat weeds affecting
certain plants in the Northwest.
   Certain crops ``would have been rather devastated'' if the EPA
had banned the weedkiller altogether, said Heier.
   Heier characterized the exceptions as small and said the tight
restrictions were designed to protect people from exposure to the
chemical.
   Several environmental groups had opposed any further sales of
the weedkiller and any provision allowing for the use of existing
supplies.
   But EPA estimated it would cost $40 million to purchase all
existing supplies of dinoseb from chemical companies and another
$155 million to dispose of it as federal law requires.
   Friday's agreement came as a result of a challenger by Cedar and
Drexel to an EPA emergency ban of dinoseb issued in October 1986.

<HEAD>USDA Scientist Tells New Process for Removing Pesticides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pesticides and antibiotics can be removed from
laboratory samples of animal tissues through the use of heated and
pressurized gases that act like liquids, a government scientist
says.
   The experimental process may be used by the Agriculture
Department in the future in its testing of domestic and imported
meat for chemical residues, chemist Jerry King of USDA's Northern
Regional Research Center at Peoria, Ill.
   His remarks to the Third Chemical Congress of North America
being held in Toronto were made available by the department.
   Some pesticides sprayed on crops are believed to cause cancer
and other serious health problems. The chemical residues remain on
grain used for livestock feed and can remain in meat products that
are taken to market.
   The Agriculture Department and other agencies are required to
inspect meat to make sure that it does not contain such residues in
excess of governmentally set tolerances.
   Antibiotics are regularly fed to livestock to prevent disease
and can remain in animal tissues.
   The new process for removing pesticides and antibiotics is
called ``supercritical extraction,'' King said.
   He described supercritical fluids as gases, such as carbon
dioxide and nitrous oxide, heated and compressed to densities that
resemble those of liquids but actually represent an intermediate
state between liquid and gas.
   The process has been used for several years to decaffeinate
coffee, extract hops for flavoring beer and refine spice, King said.
   King said supercritical extraction removed nearly 100 percent of
the pesticides in laboratory samples of lard that were deliberately
spiked with five well-known pesticides: lindane, endrin,
heptachlor, TED and dieldrin.
   ``Right now, we use this method for analytical purposes, such as
measuring the amount of pesticide in animal fat tissue,'' King
said. ``But some day it could end the use of harmful chemical
solvents used in laboratory extraction. It would eliminate the
problem of solvent waste disposal and be safer for technicians who
routinely perform such extractions on a daily basis.''

   Brace yourself for the latest farm product
with an official ``awareness week.''
   National Dairy Goat Awareness Week starts today.
   ``As an industry, we haven't advertised to consumers,'' says
Carol Jackson, vice president of Jackson-Mitchell Inc. of Santa
Barbara, Calif., which claims to be the oldest and largest U.S.
goat milk processor.
   Goat milk is sometimes used as an alternative for those allergic
to cow milk. Not surprisingly, processors are hoping to enlarge
their market.
   The industry reports sales of $100 million a year from the 84
million pounds of milk produced by the nation's goat herd. That
compares to around 140 billion pounds of cow milk produced annually
in this country.
   Raw goat milk is available in various parts of the country, to
say nothing of the pasteurized, powdered and evaporated variety,
and the goat milk in cheese, ice cream and yogurt.
   Goat milk is also sometimes used as an ingredient in soap.
   The federal government provides $4 million annually for projects
at nine universities involving production of goat milk. At the
University of California at Davis research is being done on its use
in infant formula.

   Trash bags made out of corn starch have
arrived.
   The biodegradable sacks made their debut on a recent expedition
by the National Corn Growers Association to Page, Ariz.
   The association, hunting a suitable site to unveil the bags,
chose Page because of national honors paid to the community's
annual anti-litter drive.
   ``Since we have announced our efforts to promote a degradable
trash bag, we have had calls from throughout the U.S. asking about
the properties and availability of the bags,'' said Tim Trotter, a
Coal City, Ill., corn farmer.
   Some 30,000 bags were filled in the annual ``Page Attacks
Trash'' drive, according to the Corn Growers Association, and taken
to a nearby landfill.
   They were made of a mixture of corn starch and synthetic
polymers. Archer Daniel Midland, a major corn processing concern,
owns the patent and marketing rights to the process.
   Corn Growers officials quoted ADM as saying the bags would break
down in six months.

<HEAD>Senate Subcommittee Agrees To Spend $7.5 Million For Programming
To Cuba</HEAD>

   From a blimp floating over the Florida Keys, a
proposed U.S. government television service would beam a daily diet
of American news shows, sitcoms and soap operas to the people of
Cuba.
   A Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Friday agreed to spend
$7.5 million to start a TV version of the U.S. Information Agency's
Radio Marti, which has been broadcasting to Cuba since May 1985.
   ``We want to accelerate the free flow of information to our
friends in Cuba and we want to send the message of democracy to
everyone on the island,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
chairman of the Senate panel that agreed to add the funds to USIA's
1989 budget.
   The USIA budget is to be considered by the full committee on
Thursday next week.
   Cuban-Americans have been pushing the project as a natural and
more effective follow-up to the radio service that is named for
Cuban patriot Jose Marti and devotes its air time to promoting the
cause of freedom in Cuba.
   ``TV Marti would be a much more powerful medium'' for informing
Cubans about world events as well as what is happening in their own
country, said Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the presidential
advisory board for Radio Marti.
   A program mix of American, Mexican and South American comedy,
variety and soap operas would easily draw Cuban viewers, he said.
   ``They are anxious to learn about the outside world,'' said Mas,
who heads the Cuban American National Foundation, which helped
found Radio Marti.
   The Radio Marti advisory board recently completed a feasibility
study on television broadcasting to Cuba. Radio signals can easily
reach the island 90 miles off Florida, but TV broadcasting would be
more difficult because of the nature of the signals. A TV
transmitter would have to be high enough to be in direct line of
sight of the island.
   The advisory board said the most feasible option would be to
transmit the signal from a blimp floating over the Florida Keys.
   Mas predicts that TV Marti would be even more successful than
the radio service, which Radio Marti officials estimate reaches
about a quarter of Cuba's 10 million people.
   But others are concerned about the kind of reaction a TV Marti
would elicit from Cuban leader Fidel Castro. As soon Radio Marti
went on the air, Havana retaliated with immigration sanctions,
tried to jam the broadcasting signal and interfered with the
reception of U.S. radio stations by their American audiences.
   U.S. broadcasters are concerned about possible interference from
retaliatory jamming as well as from the U.S. signal transmitted
from the blimp, said William Haratunian, a consultant for the
National Association of Broadcasters on international matters. A TV
signal transmitted so high in the air could cause problems for
American TV stations nearby, he said.

   Disagreements among OPEC ministers
meeting here today could cut as much a $2 off the price of a barrel
of oil, benefiting consumers the world over, analysts say.
   One faction of the oil-producing group is pushing for a cut in
production. A Western-oriented camp is bracing to block the move.
   Venezuela, Libya, and Algeria want a production cut to keep oil
prices at $18 a barrel. But a Saudi Arabia-led group has opposed
the idea, which failed to gain the support of oil ministers at this
week's Arab Summit in Algiers, Algeria.
   Twelve of the 28-year-old cartel's members agreed in December to
extend a quota of 15 million barrels a day until June 30. Iraq,
which is at war with Iran, refused to sign the accord because it
demanded a production quota equal to Tehran's.
   Now, the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are so divided over production controls that many
analysts expect them to fight over the issue for at least a week _
and then give up. They were expected simply to extend the existing
quota until the end of the year.
   Harry Neustein, a New York-based oil trader who was to observe
the meeting, says the disagreement will cause oil prices to fall.
   ``It's going south, which of course, is great for the
consumer,'' Neustein said.
   Some analysts said the lack of a new accord could force prices
down by as much as $2 a barrel below the organization's target of
$18.
   The oil markets also showed little confidence in the ministers'
ability to reach a consensus. The July contract price of West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil, fell 34 cents to $16.73
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday. That was
its lowest level in more than two months.
   In addition, the cartel nations are doing little to help boost
the price. Currently, they are producing an estimated 18.5 million
barrels a day, 3.4 million barrels a day more than their agreement
allows.
   The majority camp, led by Venezuela, wants to cut production to
push oil prices up nearer OPEC's target price. Venezuela ideally
would like to cut production jointly with the interested producers
outside the cartel.
   The non-OPEC members involved in the dialogue with OPEC are
Angola, China, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Oman and Malaysia. Norway
is attending the meeting as observer, while Britain is not
represented.
   Venezuela aggressively backed an unsuccessful attempt by
non-OPEC producers in late April to get the cartel to agree to cut
production.
   A minority of four OPEC nations, led by heavyweight Saudi Arabia
_ OPEC's largest producer _ blocked that attempt at the
extraordinary OPEC meeting six weeks ago at which no new agreement
was reached. At the mid-year meeting, the minority opponents of the
plan, again led by Saudi Arabia, want to boost production to match
predictions of an increase in demand in the last six months of
1988, analysts said.
   However, the cartel's members don't even agree on how large
demand will be.
   Estimates range from 17.6 million barrels a day to 18.9 million
barrels a day.
   In the first half of the year, demand was 17.7 million barrels a
day, analysts say.

<HEAD>Newspaper: North To Make Million From Speeches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, with perhaps
50 speaking engagements in front of him this year, could make more
than $1 million, a newspaper reported today.
   The former White House aide will charge $25,000 for a 40-minute
speech _ or about $600 a minute _ several industry sources told The
Miami Herald.
   Bernie Swain, partner in the Washington Speakers Bureau,
exclusive representatives for North, predicted his client will make
as many as 50 appearances this year.
   Swain told the newspaper he has booked 18 dates since North
retired from the Marines Corps in May.
   North, scheduled to be the first Iran-Contra defendant brought
to trial by special counsel Lawrence Walsh, faces up to 85 years in
prison and $4 million in fines for allegedly defrauding the
government and obstructing justice.
   He began his public speaking in May at Liberty University in
Lynchburg, Va., where he received an honorary degree. A
600-square-foot American flag formed the backdrop as evangelist
Jerry Falwell likened North to Jesus Christ. Both were victims
``indicted, convicted and crucified'' by a special prosecutor,
Falwell said.

<HEAD>Fast-Attack Submarine Contracts Awarded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy awarded a contract for two of this
year's fast-attack submarines to a Virginia company and indicated
Connecticut-based Electric Boat can win the third sub only if it
lowers its price.
   The Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. won a $612 million
contract on Friday to build two SSN-688 Los Angeles-class
submarines, scheduled to be completed in August 1993.
   Newport News outbid Electric Boat, a division of General
Dynamics Corp., said Navy Lt. Brian Cullin.
   The Navy said it would negotiate with Electric Boat to get a
lower price on the third submarine, Cullin said.
   The announcement is a disappointment for Electric Boat, which
lost out on last year's fast-attack sub competition 4-0 to its
Virginia-based arch rival. Both companies rely heavily on the Navy
contracts.
   Navy officials told Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., that Electric
Boat raised its bid at the final stage of the contract competition,
a time when companies usually lower their offers, said Gejdenson
aide Chip Partner. It was not known why Electric Boat hiked its
price. Electric Boat spokesman Neil Ruenzel declined comment.
   In a prepared statement, the company said the loss illustrates
that price ``is the acknowledged driver in today's defense industry
environment,'' and that Electric Boat will have to lower labor
costs to compete with Newport News.
   Electric Boat is in negotiations with unionized workers for a
new contract. The current contract expires June 30.
   ``The major cost in our submarine construction is labor. Newport
News, our competitor, has lower labor costs. Today's announcement
is a clear mandate for Electric Boat to hold labor costs in line
and to re-examine all possible options to lowering other key costs
elements,'' said Electric Boat in a prepared statement issued
Friday.
   Ruenzel said it was ``too early'' to assess the potential impact
on employment.
   Union officials could not be reached late Friday for comment.
   The SSN-688 submarine, a 6,900-ton vessel as long as a
professional football field, is designed to hunt down enemy surface
ships and subs. They are armed with Mark 48 anti-submarine
torpedoes, Harpoon missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   The two sub builders have been competing for the fast-attack sub
contracts since the first award in 1970. Electric Boat has won 31
SSN-688 contracts. Friday's awards brings Newport News' total up to
27.
   Last year, Newport News won all four fast-attack submarines
awarded by the Navy. In 1986, Electric Boat won all four contracts.
   The sub contracts are enormously important to the shipyards.
Electric Boat is the region's largest private employer, with 18,000
workers at its main plant in Groton, Conn., and 6,000 at its yard
in North Kingstown, R.I.
   Newport News has more than 26,000 workers at the Virginia
shipyard.
   In Virginia, Newport News spokesman Jack Schnaedter said: ``A
contract of this size adds a certain degree of long-range stability
to our work force, and it's good news for the yard to get two of
them.''

announcement he won't be bound by Senate restrictions on how to

   Reagan's announcement Friday that he would disregard the

president accepted the language when he and Soviet leader Mikhail

   But Reagan said his objections should not have any practical

interpretation should be able to be resolved ``in a spirit of

   Democrat Michael Dukakis is off to a strong
start in California and other longtime Republican strongholds in
his race against Vice President George Bush, although a closely
contested presidential election seemed likely, according to an
Associated Press survey.
   The 50-state survey indicated widespread optimism among
Democrats that Dukakis can end eight years of Republican rule in
the White House. GOP officials in many states said the contest
shapes up as a tight one, but several said Bush could win easily if
he succeeds in his attempt to depict Dukakis as an heir to the
Democratic Party's liberal past.
   Dukakis leads in the polls in California and New Jersey, which
last voted Democratic in 1964, and is running even with Bush in the
polls in Utah, which gave President Reagan his largest majorities
in 1980 and 1984. One survey shows him running even in reliably
Republican Nebraska, and within striking distance in Texas and
Florida, key Southern states.

   The catastrophic-care bill awaiting President
Reagan's signature will mean the biggest expansion of a federal
health program in a quarter century but carries a less-welcome
surprise for millions of elderly Americans: a big income tax
increase.
   For many Medicare recipients, the increase would more than wipe
out the gain won when the tax system was overhauled in 1986.
   The tax increase would kick in for 1989 income for anyone who is
eligible for Medicare. It would start by adding 15 percent to
regular tax next year, jump to 25 percent in 1990 and then rise by
as much as one percentage point a year thereafter, conceivably
reaching 35 percent by the end of the century.

   The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 initially
appeared to be a lifeline for ranchers and farmers drowning in debt
to federal loan programs.
   Yet five months after President Reagan signed the bill and
federal officials hailed it as a critical step toward helping rural
landowners hold onto their acres, ``the jury is still out'' for
thousands of borrowers on billions of dollars in delinquent loans.
   In the first quarter of this year, the act helped 8,500
``distressed'' loans to be restructured so farmers and ranchers
could keep their properties, according to Ruth Ross, spokeswoman
for the Farm Credit Corporation of America.
   But many other farmers owe their money to the Farmers Home
Administration, whose regulations under the act are not yet
settled, and some have been unable to apply for the aid provided by
the landmark legislation.
   The borrower-owned Farm Credit System of banks and lending
cooperatives lost $4.8 billion from 1985 through last year, said H.
Brent Beesley, president of the Farm Credit Corporation of America,
which oversees the Farm Credit System.
   The system's problems, coupled with land devaluation and low
crop prices, were forcing thousands of farms onto the auction
block, Beesley said.
   The act provides up to $4 billion in federal funds to
financially troubled farm credit institutions through 1992,
protecting farmers' stock in those banks and cooperatives.
   It also requires farm loans to be restructured _ changing the
terms in some way so the debt can still be repaid _ if that would
cost less than foreclosure.
   Until the legislation passed, loan restructuring was a voluntary
effort, said Jeff Oates, a spokesman for the Farm Credit
Corporation. ``Now the law says, `You will restructure.'''
   ``I think it's working just fine,'' Beesley said of the
legislation. ``Investors have greater confidence in the system, and
so do borrowers. We're very pleased with the act.''
   But at the office of the Coalition to Save Rural America, based
in this plains town in northeastern Colorado, the hotline rings
steadily.
   ``It's sort of a big question mark,'' said Bill Glover, who
estimated he had fielded hundreds of calls about the act. ``Because
of the complexities in borrowing practices, what happens in one
lending institution could affect them in another federal
institution.''
   The major stumbling block in the process arises from the
structure of the federal lending agencies and the pattern of how
farmers borrow.
   Many farmers have multiple loans spread among the various
lenders. The 37 Farm Land Banks, for example, make long-term land
loans, and the 387 lending cooperatives known as Production Credit
Associations make short-term operating loans.
   Those agencies come under the Farm Credit System. But the
Farmers Home Administration, which makes both types of loans, is
supervised by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and rules for the
FmHA are still in the public approval process.
   The FmHA has balked at going along with restructuring plans for
borrowers that hold its loans as well as others, fearing
vulnerability.
   ``I had a case over in the Western Slope where the lender at the
Federal Land Bank said they would work anything out with the
farmer, as long as the FmHA would agree to it,'' Glover said.
``FmHA couldn't agree to anything because the rules and regulations
weren't out yet _ and they don't know what they can agree to.''
   Jerry Slaugh, a consultant who helps farmers with restructuring,
predicted it might take until January for the FmHA to be absorbed
into the act.
   ``Until then, anyone with a Farmers Home Administration loan is
just in limbo,'' he said. ``It's just putting a litte bit of a
shadow on our efforts out there because they (FmHA) are not ready
to sit down at the table and negotiate about restructuring.''
   So far this year, Slaugh says he has saved 10 farms by
restructuring loans. He is working on about 50 more with Bill
Byers, a former farmer and his partner in Ag Management
Consultants, based in Grand Junction.
   The company has a contract with the state's rural job training
program to help indebted farmers. It also has clients with loans
from Federal Land Banks in the Wichita, Kan., district.
   Slaugh estimated that those banks hold about 40,000 loans in
Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma, and that 4,000 of them
are distressed, meaning they are delinquent or potentially
deliquent. That's about half as many as a few years ago.
   ``The new legislation has given us more tools,'' he said. ``At
this point, the jury is still out. We've had some success _ not as
much as we'd like to see. (But) compared to when we started three
years ago, it's a world of difference.''
   Terry Gutschenritter, vice president of special credit for the
Farm Credit System in Wichita, said his agency last year opened a
special credit department for distressed loans and was able to
``bring back'' about 45 percent of 5,000 loans so families could
stay on their farms, he said.
   For farmers and ranchers with distressed loans, the crucial step
is to respond quickly to notices from lenders, warned John Stencel,
president of the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, a grass-roots
general farm organization with 18,000 members in Colorado, New
Mexico and Wyoming.
   ``Borrowers are currently receiving letters from the Farm Credit
System advising them of their rights to ask for their loans to be
restructured,'' Stencel said. ``If borrowers don't respond within
45 days, Farm Credit can begin foreclosure.
   ``If farmers miss the deadline, they still have the right to
request restructuring, but the cost of foreclosure may diminish
chances of restructuring as (the less expensive) alternative.''
   Agriculture attorneys Judith A. Shively and Joseph Dworkin,
partners with offices near the state Capitol in Denver, see the
1987 legislation as a tool _ particularly because it obligates the
lender to notify the borrower before any foreclosure action is
taken.
   ``We have found ... farmers as a group have always been
hard-working, God-fearing people who have paid their debts, and now
they find they can't pay their debts,'' Dworkin said. ``And when
you have to ask that type of an individual to file bankruptcy, you
get tremendous resistance.
   But farmers today ``have to be aware of every single government
program and use it to the max,'' he said. They also must know what
it takes to grow cattle or crops _ and be good money managers, too,
he said.
   Many farmers in trouble today meet those criteria, but bad
weather and the economy bring them to the Rural Coalition,
consultants like Slaugh and attorneys who are experts in
agricultural law.
   ``The legislation will be beneficial, but it won't eliminate the
farm crisis,'' Gutschenritter said. ``A positive income situation _
better prices _ is what is needed.
   ``I think it's going to be a much wiser farm credit system as a
result of these times. It will make us tougher, better farmers.''

<TEXT>
   Over the past two decades U.S. industry has
shucked a lot of its old bad habits, and now is the better for
having done so.
   Looking back, it's evident that the change wasn't motivated so
much by enthusiasm as by fear _ by the fear, for example, that
foreign manufacturers might steal not just foreign markets but U.S.
markets too.
   Old habits are comfortable habits, and many U.S. companies
preferred the old ways and so disappeared from the scene. So did
typically American products, such as television sets and
calculators. Asia took over the business.
   Some industries fought back, cutting their corporate
bureacracies, closing inefficient operations, ending waste,
resolving labor-management battles, updating factories with robots
and electronic controls.
   In short, U.S. industry in the past 15 years or so has become
leaner, smarter, meaner and more competitive. Still, there remains
a gaping weakness that could offset many of the modern improvements.
   That weakness is the inability of many U.S. companies to rapidly
transform new technology, much of it developed in the United
States, into profitable products.
   That in itself would be reason to worry, but there is an added
dimension to the problem: Quick transformation, or exploitation, is
the very skill of some Japanese and other Asian producers of
high-technology products.
   More than half of over 500 U.S. executives, academics and state
officials surveyed recently said that a major barrier to
competitiveness is the excessive time lag in converting technology
to new commercial products.
   That study, sponsored by the Conference Board, the National
Governors' Association and the National Science Foundation, found
that an old bugaboo of U.S. industrial management might be a
primary source of the problem.
   That bugaboo: the seeming inability of American business to
focus on long-term goals, to have a distant vision of the future
rather than a nearsighted fixation on the short term.
   It doesn't take a study to realize two of the reasons why:
   _U.S. corporate executives are paid and promoted for turning out
products today, not tomorrow. Ironically, in focusing on
``today's'' products, they end up turning out those of yesterday.
Competitors beat them.
   A flow of products results from long-term rather than short-term
goals. Yet, according to the survey, American business still
indicates a tendency to become impatient with the long-term view.
   _U.S. industry is under constant pressure to produce profits
now, not tomorrow.
   Executives have a limited time in which to prove themselves.
While they might believe that a corporate shakeup will show results
five years down the road, they must deal with the possibility they
might be fired before then.
   Therefore, they go with what they consider the tried and true
and often old-fashioned products.
   In addition, the U.S. investment climate is such that Wall
Street brokers demand immediate results. In fact, there is pressure
on executives of some companies to show results not in the next
year but in the next quarter or two.
   It creates a baffling paradox, one that American industry must
resolve if it is to keep pace with the often smaller, more agile
entrepreneurs of Southeast Asia.

<HEAD>Market Awaits New Junk Bond Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traders and investors alike are scrounging for
new junk in the credit markets.
   They are eagerly awaiting the high-yield, high-risk junk bonds
that will be issued to help finance many of the mergers and
acquisitions that have taken place recently on the corporate
takeover trail.
   ``There have been a number of deals completed in the last two
months where it is anticipated that (junk bond) financing will be
accomplished,'' said Michael Dahood, a high-yield bond analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   He said British industrialist Brian Beazer is likely to use junk
bonds to finance at least some of his $1.7 billion buyout of the
Pittsburgh-based cement company, Koppers Co.
   ``And American Standard Inc. is almost certain to come to market
at some point,'' he added, referring to the $2.5 billion leveraged
buyout of the company that is being led by Kelso & Co.
   It also is anticipated that Toronto retailer Robert Campeau will
raise more than $1 billion through the sale of junk bonds to
facilitate his acquisition of Federated Department Stores Inc.
Campeau also is likely to rely on junk bonds to finance the spinoff
of Ralph's supermarket chain as a subsidiary.
   ``Some of the takeovers do create very large issues, and that
alone is a sudden injection of product into the market,'' said
Robert Waill, a managing director at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg,
Towbin.
   ``In terms of getting business going, I suppose it's good _ it
does create a certain amount of motion,'' he said.
   A slowdown in mergers and acquisitions since the market crash
resulted in a reduced supply of new junk bond issues. ``That may be
contributing to the richness of the market,'' Dahood said referring
to the high prices at which are selling and trading.
   Conversely, yields on many of these debt issues are not as
handsome as they have been historically. Dahood characterized
current returns as ``rather skimpy.''
   When comparing relative yields, ``the junk bond market is
providing a rather skimpy incremental return to the Treasury market
at the 10-year issuance,'' he said.
   Because high-yield debt securities often are issued for 10-year
terms, they typically are measured against the 10-year Treasury
bill.
   Junk bonds currently are trading about 425 to 475 basis points
above the 10-year Treasury bill, which is hovering just under 9
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   In the past, however, junk bonds have traded as much as 600
basis points above the government security, and, more recently, 500
to 550 basis points above, Dahood said.
   Putting it another way, ``the premium for accepting the risk
today is somewhat smaller than it has been,'' he noted.
   In addition to the takeover issues that might revive the market,
some analysts say corporations are being driven to lock in
fixed-rate debt as overall interest rates move higher.
   ``Companies that launched leveraged buyouts late last year and
financed them with bank and bridge loans at floating rates are now
getting nervous as interest rates move up,'' noted Gail Hessol,
managing director of industrial rating at Standard and Poor's Corp.
   One attractive option is to sell fixed-rate public debt.
   Despite the high level of risk associated with junk bonds and
allegations of scandal and wrongdoing at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., the pioneer in junk-bond underwriting, investor interest
remains keen.
   Some estimate there are some $160 billion in outstanding junk
bonds, with as much as 10 percent held by individuals as opposed to
institutional investors.
   A surge in junk-bond mutual funds is also making the high-yield
instrument more accessible to the average investor. Quoting from a
recent government study, Dahood said there were 23 junk bond mutual
funds in 1981 with assets of $3.1 billion; by Sept. 30, 1987, the
number had mushroomed to 72, and their assets totaled more than $30
billion.

<HEAD>Central Bankers, Others Paint Picture Of Economic Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gathering of top-level executives from the
world's biggest banks produced a picture of economic harmony,
supported by improved trade, stable exchange rates and healthy
growth.
   While few economists would dispute those assertions, made this
past week at the 34th annual International Monetary Conference in
Chicago, many agreed the current state of affairs, particularly
involving currencies, was more a product of inertia than
policymaking.
   ``Policy is on hold,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist
for Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. ``The
policymakers are kind of hemmed in. They don't know what to do.''
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made it clear
during the three-day Chicago meeting that he didn't want the dollar
to fall any further, for fear it could harm ongoing attempts to
reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit.
   Greenspan told a separate press briefing the ``adjustment
process,'' by which the dollar has been allowed to depreciate over
the past three years to enhance the U.S. trade picture by making
exports less expensive abroad, ``has made significant progress.''
   But he said since manufacturers already are running at or near
capacity levels due to healthy export growth, further dollar
declines wouldn't help them sell more goods overseas or anywhere
else, facilitating inflationary pressures.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl and Bank of France Governor
Jacques de Larosiere publicly agreed with Greenspan. Poehl also
made assurances that his country wasn't trying to drive down the
U.S. currency, discounting recent dollar sales as a routine effort
to trim dollar reserves.
   Other central bankers at the conference included: Bank of
England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Bank of Mexico Director
General Miguel Mancera and Takeshi Ohta, deputy governor for
international relations for the Bank of Japan.
   Some currency traders and economists remained skeptical about
the underlying motives of West Germany and about how long the major
industrialized nations could maintain stability.
   David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities Inc. in
New York, said, ``There seems to be an emerging technical reason
for the dollar to be on the firm side in the next month or so,''
partly due to U.S. agricultural sales to the Soviets and Chinese.
   He said the Bundesbank might privately be ``trying to temper the
upward pressure of the dollar that might emerge. A rise in the
dollar, should it occur, would bring instability in the markets
because it's not sustainable.''
   Economists say the upbeat picture publicly presented by the
central bankers this past week amounted to an ``open-mouth policy''
clearly aimed at maintaining the narrow trading range for
currencies that has existed in recent months.
   ``There's PR and hot air involved here ... They want to enhance
the view that they are unified in the open. They prefer the
status,'' said F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist for
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   But there are drawbacks to resisting change, economists say.
   For one thing, ``there's no lure to foreign capital to make
currency gains on their dollar holdings,'' said Brusca.
   ``As long as they hold the dollar in this narrow trading range
you have monetary policy effectively transmitted as though it were
a fixed-rate system,'' said Brusca. ``And even though the rates in
this sytem are `fixed' they're not really fixed and you can't be
sure the floor under the dollar is solid and dependable.''
   The currency markets have been trading on a ``floating rate''
system since early 1973, following about three decades of fixed
rates that grew out of the historic post-World War II Bretton Woods
agreement.
   The stage was set for a drop in the dollar in September 1985,
when the United States and its four major trading partners agreed
to devalue the currency to help reduce the U.S. trade shortfall and
stave off protectionist legislation. Last year, however, that same
group agreed that further decines in the dollar's value would be
``counterproductive.''
   In the last three years, the dollar has lost half its value
against such currencies as the West German mark and Japanese yen.
It has fallen less against the currencies of such major trading
partners as Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The Commerce Department released a seasonally adjusted trade
deficit report for March, which showed the shortfall turned out to
be $11.9 billion, 22 percent higher than the previously reported
$9.7 billion figure. Other reports showed lbor productivity up
strongly in the first quarter, wholesale prices up 0.5 percent in
May and installment borrowing up moderately in April.
   _The Commerce Department said a survey completed in May showed
businesses plan to modernize and expand at the fastest rate in four
years. The bullish trend was attributed to booming export sales.
   _The Conference Board said consumer confidence climbed in May to
its highest point since 1969 as low inflation and a strong job
market left people ``somewhat euphoric.''
   _A trade group of lenders said the number of Americans late on
their mortgage payments fell to the second-lowest level of this
decade during the first three months of the year.
   _The government said earnings at the nation's commercial banks
are rebounding from the worst year since the Depression in every
region of the country except the Southwest. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said the 13,500 banks it insures earned $5 billion
in the first three months of this year, down somewhat from $5.3
billion in the same period in 1987.
   _Federal regulators ordered payment of a record $1.35 billion to
depositors in two insolvent savings institutions in Costa Mesa,
Calif., without arranging for a takeover by another institution.
   _The Transportation Department reported that the nation's
airlines had their best on-time performance and least number of
consumer complaints to the government in the latest aviation
consumer statistics.
   _Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said the company is
studying ways to restructure its troubled Eastern Airlines
subsidiary but has no plans to sell the operation. Meanwhile, a
federal appellate court lifted an injunction barring Eastern from
selling its Northeast shuttle operation to another subsidiary Texas
Air.
   _Dalfort Corp., the majority shareholder of Braniff Inc.,
announced plans to sell its shares of the airline to an investor
group formed by Paine Webber Group Inc.
   _The board of Pan American World Airways authorized the sale of
assets if no agreements on concessions can be reached with the
airlines' unions.
   _Texaco Inc., locked in a battle with corporate raider Carl
Icahn, agreed to sell its West German subsidiary to that country's
largest utility company, for $1.2 billion. The oil giant also
promised to give stockholders a third of the $5 billion it expects
to raise from asset sales as part of its bankruptcy reorganization
plan. Meanwhile, Icahn raised to $300 million the money he would
forfeit if he failed to arrange financing for his takeover of
Texaco.
   _A state judge in Delaware granted Texas investor Robert M.
Bass's request to halt a major restructuring by Macmillan Inc., the
publisher Bass has offered to acquire for $1.9 billion.
   _National Broadcasting Co. said it would lease, rather than buy,
the cable channel Tempo Television for a proposed business news
service. It cited tax considerations for the change in strategy.
   _A consumer group's accusation that the sporty Suzuki Samurai is
prone to roll over is ``inaccurate and defamatory,'' the automaker
said. In another consumer case, Audi of America Inc. said it would
offer rebates on new Audi purchases to customers whose
automatic-transmission models were prone to sudden acceleration.
   _The United Auto Workers union and Chrysler Corp. made their new
two-year labor pact official, signing the agreement covering 66,000
workers.

<HEAD>Glut Of Frozen Pork Bellies Is Good News For BLT Lovers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with an ADD containing weekly
price trends</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Lovers of bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches may be inclined to
add an extra layer of bacon to their BLTs this summer.
   A glut of frozen pork bellies forced futures prices into a
virtual free fall this past week and analysts say retail prices for
bacon, which is made from pork bellies, will likely plummet as well.
   The futures market for frozen pork bellies was created to ensure
adequate supplies of bellies during the summer, when demand for
bacon peaks and supplies of slaughter-ready hogs traditionally
bottoms out. Dealers typically stockpile pork bellies in freezers
during the fall and winter, then thaw them out and slice them into
bacon during the late spring and summer.
   Last year, light hog production resulted in tight supplies of
frozen pork bellies for the summer months and futures prices soared
last summer above 90 cents a pound, a five-year high.
   Dealers compensated by packing away lots of pork bellies during
last fall and winter. They put so many bellies in cold storage that
supplies swelled to nearly 103 million pounds by May 1, more than
double the previous year's May 1 figure and the third largest total
on record for that date, according to the Agriculture Department.
   ``This year they got carried away when they put bellies into
storage,'' said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in Chicago with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``They went from a period of deficit to one of tremendous
surplus in one year because they overcompensated for having run out
last summer,'' he said.
   Because of this abundance, the price on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange for July delivery of frozen pork bellies has plunged 11
percent already this month, from 56.32 cents a pound on May 31 to
50.07 cents on Friday.
   Analysts said they expected the decline to continue until prices
fall low enough to stimulate demand _ possibly as low as 40 cents a
pound.
   And those prices are certain to filter down to the retail level,
analysts said.
   ``They should be able to offer relatively attractive bacon
prices this summer,'' said Dale Durccholz, an analyst with
AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   In addition to the large supplies of frozen pork bellies, the
market faces good supplies of higher-quality fresh bellies caused
by an unseasonably high number of hog slaughters, analysts said.
   Packers have not cut down on kills because low cash prices for
pork products have narrowed their profit margins, said Tom O'Hare,
an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   And Durccholz said some hog producers, faced with rising feed
costs due to the spring drought, may be partially liquidating their
herds, thus adding to the number of animals available for slaughter.
   O'Hare said frozen pork belly futures prices may rebound briefly
before sliding lower.
   ``Technically, the bellies have definitely got to be oversold at
this point,'' he said. ``It's low enough that at some point soon,
you've got to get people saying `Hey, this is overdone,' and going
in and buying it.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Hails `Summer Rally'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the calendar says it's still springtime,
Wall Street is talking up what it bills as a ``summer rally'' that
began at the end of May in the stock market.
   After drifting downward on shrinking volume for several weeks,
stocks came to life after the Memorial Day weekend.
   By this past Friday, many of the leading market indicators had
reached or approached new highs for the year _ and since the crash
last October.
   The revival of enthusiasm for stocks has puzzled many observers,
who haven't noticed any drastic change in the economic news.
   Money managers at investing institutions, it appears, have
simply decided that economic growth is holding to a pace that is
moderate enough to continue without a serious increase in
inflationary pressures.
   ``It certainly looks as though the summer rally I have been
writing about is upon us,'' Greg Smith, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities, told the firm's clients.
   In the lush world of Wall Street folklore, few phenomena are as
enduring as the summer rally.
   Never mind the numerous studies that have found that stock
prices have no discernible tendency to do any better in the summer
than at any other time during the year.
   Never mind that the very idea almost surely originated as a way
to drum up business for brokers in a season when customers'
attention often wanders to distractions like vacations, long
weekends and baseball games.
   As the past couple of weeks have demonstrated, the phrase is so
firmly entrenched that it can be applied to an advance that takes
place before the summer has even arrived.
   By whatever name, the market turned in an upbeat showing in the
past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 30.41
points to 2,101.71, just a shade below its 1988 closing high of
2,110.08 reached on April 12.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.58 to 152.89;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
increased 9.39 to 386.25; and the American Stock Exchange market
value index climbed 8.45 to 309.33.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 204.41 million shares a day,
against 216.33 million the week before.
   ``There are some good things happening for both the economy and
the financial markets,'' said Hugh Johnson, an analyst at First
Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``The Federal Reserve has tightened credit conditions a notch,
but not too much. The growth of the money supply should continue to
be moderate during the next three months.
   ``The economy, on the other hand, seems to be responding to
changes in Federal Reserve policy or whatever by slowing down.
   ``This is a good combination since it suggests that there will
be enough liquidity to drive the economy and have some left over
for the financial markets. Historically that has been positive for
stock prices.''
   However, he added, ``when we are in the 66th month of an
economic recovery, it seems judicious to interpret economic signals
quite conservatively.''
   A return of the kind of speculative mania that drove stocks to
extraordinarily high levels last year is unlikely in the near
future, Johnson said. ``The memories of October linger on.''
   Indeed, few forecasters these days have their sights set on
anything like the market highs set last summer, when the Dow Jones
industrial average peaked at 2,722.42. A runaway rise back to those
levels would be seen by many analysts as scary.
   A nice little summer rally, on the other hand, would get a warm
welcome all around.
