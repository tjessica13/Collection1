   Democratic Govs. Richard Celeste of Ohio and
Mario Cuomo of New York proposed Monday that Midwestern states
voluntarily cut power plant emissions blamed for acid rain in return
for federal aid to institute the reductions.
   The proposal is aimed at breaking a deadlock in Congress over
cutting emissions that are believed responsible for acid rain in the
eastern United States and Canada without economically crippling the
Midwest, the two governors said in a joint statement.
   Celeste said the proposal ``strikes the balance between the need
to protect jobs and clean up the environment without hanging like a
Damocles' sword over the coal industry.''
   Cuomo called the agreement a ``terrific idea'' which he hopes can
be sold to other governors and to Congress.
   The proposal will be introduced in Congress shortly as an
amendment to the federal Clean Air Act by U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., said Gary Fryer, Cuomo's chief spokesman.
   According to the two governors, the proposal calls for a 10
million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired
utility plants nationwide in three stages by the year 2003 and a 3
million-ton reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions by 1998.
   Officials say about 23 million tons of sulfur dioxide and about
10 million tons of nitrogen dioxide are expelled into the atmosphere
nationally each year, with the biggest bulk emitted from several
Midwestern states.
   The two governors estimated it would cost about $1.8 billion a
year to reduce emissions under the plan. They proposed that
polluters would pay half that cost, the oil industry would pay $650
million a year and the federal government would pay the remaining
$250 million annually.
   The proposal also calls for a 10-year, $2.5 billion expansion of
federal ``clean coal'' programs to develop new technologies for
reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. That money
would be handed out on a 50 percent matching-grant basis, the two
governors said.
   The plan calls for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to
administer the emissions reduction program.
   Other proposed Clean Air Act amendments now being considered by
Congress would require Midwestern states to meet stricter emissions
limits in a shorter time period.
   ``People like Dick Celeste who are very pragmatic and very smart,
they see coming down the road a heavier hit on them than our bill
would propose,'' Cuomo said. ``Plus, they see a chance to have the
federal government pick up 50 percent of their costs of going to the
new technology. So it (the proposal) serves a lot of different
interests at the same time.''
   At a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, Celeste said the acid
rain issue has been delayed too long by those who ``prefer what is
going on in Ohio now _ nothing. We're tiptoeing past the graveyard''
he said, adding the state's economy will suffer if a compromise is
not found.
   Celeste admitted the plan would face stiff opposition from
utilities and coal producers and said he is willing to compromise as
long as some amount of federal funding is retained.
   American Electric Power Co. said it would have to cancel plans to
build the world's largest clean-coal plant, near New Haven, W.Va.,
if the proposal is passed. The Columbus-based company also said
average electricity rates for customers of its eight subsidiary
utilities in seven states would increase as much as 15 percent.
   New York is one of eight Northeastern states suing the EPA in the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., to demand that
the agency order seven Midwestern and Southern states to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants.
   The agreement will not affect New York's pursuit of the suit,
Cuomo administration officials said.
   New York has claimed that hundreds of lakes in its Adirondack
Mountains have high acid levels that are dangerous to plant and
animal life.
   Many environmentalists in the eastern United States and Canada
maintain that emissions coming mainly from the Midwest are carried
eastward by the wind and fall to the ground as acid rain or snow.

<HEAD>Prisoners Riot Over Pin-Ups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prisoners ordered to remove pin-up posters from
newly painted walls damaged 28 buildings in an eight-hour riot in
western England and staged Britain's biggest breakout in five years,
officials said Monday.
   ``Nearly every part of the institution has been burned down,''
David Evans, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association,
said on British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   Twenty-seven convicts escaped from low-security Haverigg Prison
during Sunday night's rioting and arson, but only three remained at
large Monday, said a spokesman for the Home Office, the government
department responsible for prisons and police.
   It was the biggest prison break since 38 convicted members of the
Irish Republican Army escaped from Maze Prison near Belfast,
Northern Ireland, in 1983.
   The Home Office said no guards were hurt at Haverigg, but one
prisoner was sent to the hospital with what looked like a broken jaw
and 10 others were treated for minor injuries at the prison, 280
miles west of London.
   ``There was a rampage by about 100 prisoners after they were told
to take down pin-ups,'' said a Home Office spokesman, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   He said the prisoners smashed their rooms, pulled down sections
of the perimeter fence and started fires.
   Scores of police with dogs joined prison guards to encircle the
remote, seaside prison after the riots began about 8 p.m. Sunday and
raged until about 4 a.m. Monday. Firemen waited for hours before
entering the prison because of fears they would be attacked.
   Evans said on the BBC broadcast, ``The kitchen, the clothing
exchange stores, all the education departments, all the things that
the prisoners need for recreation have been burned down and many of
the wings, too, will not be able to house them today or for the very
near future.''
   John Jones, deputy north regional director for the Home Office
Prisons Department, said doors, windows, wash basins, toilets and
asbestos roofs were damaged by prisoners armed with stones and ``any
small implement which came to hand.''
   The prison houses 490 inmates. It is a former air force camp and
is classified as an open prison, a low-security facility used for
prisoners either nearing release or considered not dangerous by
parole boards.
   The 390 prisoners who gave themselves up were sheltered in a
workshop, Cumbria police said. Some were later bused to other
prisons while the damage at Haverigg was cleaned up.

<HEAD>`To Be a Jew and a Southerner' _ Cultures Blend as Migration Grows</HEAD>

   Jews have lived in the South for more than 200 years, but their
history as a subgroup has long been ignored. Their religious roots
and desire to fit in alongside their often fundamentalist Christian
neighbors have produced a cultural blending that sets them apart
from the American Jewish establishment.
   ``I am not certain what it means to be both a Jew and a
Southerner,'' Eli Evans wrote in his personal account of growing up
in Durham, N.C. ``To have inherited the Jewish longing for a
homeland while being raised with the Southerner's sense of home.''
   The Sunbelt is home for more Jews now. The Jewish population in
the South has grown to about 1.1 million in Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, according to a 1987
estimate made for the American Jewish Committee. Florida has about
half of the South's Jewish population, mostly in the southern part
of the state.
   The committee counts about 5.9 million Jews throughout the United
States.
   Jews historically were scattered in rural communities across the
region, and their presence remains strongest in medium-sized cities
and small towns through active congregations like B'nai Shalom in
tiny Blountville, Tenn.
   ``I have to come in for a cultural injection now and then because
I miss it,'' said Sharon Moskowitz, 36, a New York native who with
her husband and two children travels from Marion, Va., to
Blountville most Friday nights to attend services at B'nai Shalom.
   They are the only Jews in Marion, a town of about 7,000 in
southwestern Virginia near the northeastern Tennessee border.
   ``I used to be super, super anxious about it,'' Ms. Moskowitz
said of rearing her 6-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter in a
non-Jewish town. ``My son goes to camp in Long Island and he was the
only one who knew the Hebrew songs at the camp. In the North, they
live it so they don't have to learn it. We can't take it for
granted.''
   Judy Peiser, who still lives in her hometown of Memphis, Tenn.,
and heads the Center for Southern Folklore there, said, ``I'm always
explaining the Jewish culture. It's a constant learning process for
them (non-Jewish Southerners) and a teaching process for Jews.
You've got to know the answers.''
   Jews first ventured to the South from the Northeast or took more
direct routes to flee unfriendly European and Spanish homelands via
ocean ports in Galveston, Texas, Charleston, S.C., and other
Southern cities.
   The first arrivals were refugees of the fading Spanish
Inquisition who dived early into the American melting pot and
enthusiastically adopted the aristocratic Southern culture.
   The Spanish-speaking Jews were followed in the early- to
mid-1800s by Jews from Germany who set out on foot as peddlers,
saved enough money to buy horses, then wagons and later opened
shops. They were followed by a huge wave of East European immigrants
who were more outwardly religious and who disdained the
assimilationist tendencies of the earlier arrivals.
   Jews often took prominent places in their new Southern hometowns,
and the region today lacks a distinct blue-collar Jewish class.
   ``Jews had to walk a very tight line,'' said Abraham Peck,
administrative director of the American Jewish Archives at Hebrew
Union College in Cincinnati. ``It's really an amazing thing that
they were able to live in two worlds, one a world of (their own)
religious liberalism and the other a closed-off, segregated
society.''
   American Judaism's most liberal faction, Reform Judaism, was born
in the South, where Jews were more economically dependent on their
non-Jewish neighbors _ black and white.
   Carolyn Lipson-Walker, whose doctoral dissertation is titled
``Shalom Y'all: The Folklore and Culture of Southern Jews,'' said
Southern Jews have fused their social and religious practices to
produce a dual culture.
   Among the examples her research turned up:
   _ A cookbook put together by the women of a synagogue in Baton
Rouge, La., includes a recipe for matzoh ball gumbo.
   _ A synagogue in Brookhaven, Miss., for years held a high holy
day shrimp fry, even though traditional Jewish dietary laws ban
shellfish.
   _ A Jewish family in Texas often barbecued matzoh on their
backyard grill.
   _ A Nashville, Tenn., octogenarian recalled a temple celebration
marked by the arrival of ``Hanukkah Claus on reindeer.''
   A Jewish man from Savannah, Ga., explained he never thought of
marrying outside of his faith. Asked what he meant, Ms.
Lipson-Walker said he replied, ``Well, Southern Jews, of course.''
   Ethnic differences were discouraged in the South _ she remembers
being chided as a child in Tuscaloosa, Ala., for using Yiddish words
_ but the practice of religion was encouraged, Ms. Lipson-Walker
said.
   Jews in the South, both natives and transplants, are affiliated
with synagogues and other Jewish organizations more than Jews living
elsewhere, and Jews in the South often travel hundreds of miles to
seek Jewish contact for themselves and their children, her research
concluded.
   ``Until recently, even the Conservative and Orthodox Jews in the
South were less traditional than their Northern Jewish
counterparts,'' Ms. Lipson-Walker wrote. ```What will the goyim
(non-Jews) think?' takes on a great significance in the relatively
homogeneous South.''
   The South has its notorious examples of violent anti-Semitism,
including the Ku Klux Klan and the Atlanta lynching of Leo Frank for
the murder of a 14-year-old pencil factory worker in 1913. But Gail
Gans, a researcher in New York for the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, said the region no longer stands out as a bastion of
discrimination and hatred against Jews.
   ``It has historically, of course,'' she said.
   Evans, Peck and other researchers agreed the post-Civil War
period was among the worst for anti-Semitism in the South.
   A notable example was the scapegoating of Judah P. Benjamin, a
New Orleans lawyer who served as attorney general, secretary of war
and secretary of state under Jefferson Davis. Many blamed him for
the Confederacy's defeat, while others falsely accused him of
involvement in Abraham Lincoln's assassination, Evans said. Benjamin
fled in disguise to England.
   ``During the 1870s and through the beginning of the 20th century,
anti-Semitism in the South, in all its manifestations ... were the
actions of powerless men reaching out to compensate for their
economic distress,'' Peck wrote in a paper on Southern Jewry.
   Blacks served as a lightning rod, absorbing expressions of bias
that might otherwise have been directed at Jews in the South, where
anti-Semitism was aimed more ``against a generalized stereotype of
the Jew,'' said Joseph Cohen, a Tennessean who founded the Jewish
Studies Program at Tulane University.
   ``The blacks and the Catholics had the worst time of it and they
were always a buffer,'' he said.
   As for Southern Jews, their years of being neighbors and local
merchants seemed to help defuse potential trouble. Said Cohen:
``There was a big difference between the stereotypical Jew and Sam
who ran the store.''

<HEAD>Argentina Considering Shutdown Of Nuclear Plant Project</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>

   Financial shortfalls may force
Argentina, Latin America's leading user of nuclear power, to halt
construction on a third nuclear reactor and a heavy-water plant, its
top nuclear official says.
   Plans are being made to stop work on the nuclear reactor Atucha
II, which is 60 percent completed, and Arroyito, 90 percent
finished, unless financing is obtained or the government agrees to a
$800 million budget request, said Emma Perez Ferreira, president of
the National Atomic Energy Commission.
   ``We'll have to stop work on the big ones first if we don't get
enough money or obtain financing for the projects,'' Ms. Perez
Ferreira, Argentina's top-ranking female government official, said
in a recent interview.
   A shutdown could hurt Argentina's nuclear industry, which is the
most advanced in the Western Hemisphere outside the United States
and Canada, and cut into its future sales of surplus heavy water.
   Argentina has a contract to build a $100-million, 10-megawatt
nuclear reactor outside Lima, Peru. It also has contracts to build a
nuclear reactor in Algeria and to provide enriched uranium for a
small experimental nuclear reactor at Iran's Tehran University, Ms.
Perez Ferreira said.
   Argentina's nuclear technicians have mastered the entire fuel
cycle, which gives them the ability to make nuclear weapons, but
officials from President Raul Alfonsin on down deny this is in their
plans.
   At one time, the nuclear program was closely tied to the armed
forces, in particular the navy. An admiral headed the Atomic Energy
Commission until the early 1980s, and some reports at the time said
the military favored building an atomic bomb.
   Argentina mines its own uranium ore in the Andes. It prepares its
own fuel, and is capable of enriching the fuel, making fuel
elements, running nuclear reactors and reprocessing the fuel.
Enriching and reprocessing fuel are the keys to making nuclear
weapons.
   Argentina, the world's eighth-largest country geographically, has
two existing nuclear power plants. Until its economic crisis
worsened last year, it had dreams of building four power plants by
the end of the century.
   ``There's no sense in talking now even about a fourth nuclear
plant,'' Ms. Perez Ferreira said. Argentina also has an
uranium-enrichment plant, six research reactors and two reprocessing
plants.
   The nuclear program is important to Argentina, providing up to 20
percent of its electrical power, and is a source of pride to a
country whose standard of living has declined steadily since the
1950s.
   But now Argentina is the developing world's third-largest debtor
behind Brazil and Mexico, owing $55 billion. It also has a 247
percent inflation rate in addition to other severe economic
problems, including a loss of real wages for workers.
   Indeed, 22 percent of Atomic Energy Commission's 6,500-member
work force have left their jobs since 1983, many for similar posts
offering double their pay in Switzerland, Brazil and the United
States, Ms. Perez Ferreira said.
   Neighboring Brazil has a nuclear-power program but its sole plant
near Rio de Janeiro has had constant troubles. Plans to build two
other nuclear plants have been set aside for the time being.
   Ms. Perez Ferreira, a 52-year-old nuclear physicist, took over
the commission last year when her predecessor quit over budgetary
disputes with the government. As head of commission, she reports
directly to President Alfonsin.
   Although officials deny any plans for nuclear weapons, Argentina
has yet to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
   It opposes the treaty on grounds that it interferes with national
sovereignty. The other non-signatory nations with nuclear technology
are South Africa, Israel, India, Pakistan and Brazil.
   Accidents at Argentine nuclear facilities have left three
technicians dead since 1982 but experts say Argentina is not
considered unsafe. A radioactive water spill and a burst pipe also
briefly shut down Atucha I and the Embalse plant last year and in
May.
   National reliance on nuclear-generated power became apparent in
April when power shortages caused in part by temporary shutdowns of
Atucha I and Embalse forced emergency power cutoffs in Buenos Aires,
Mar del Plata and other major cities.
   Argentina's nuclear interest stems from 1950, during the first
presidency of Juan D. Peron. Its first power plant was Atucha I, a
335-megawatt facility built with West German technology in 1974.
   The second, Embalse, outside Cordoba in north-central Argentina,
was finished in 1983. Built with Canadian technology, it has 600
megawatts of power, equal to the Connecticut Yankee plant in the
United States.
   Atucha II, if it is completed, will have 745 megawatts.

   A reputation for ruthlessness stuck to Robert F. Kennedy, because
it seemed to explain something about him.
   He was the kid who lived to tackle in football games; the
diligent young aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy; the hound on Jimmy
Hoffa's trial; the designated S.O.B. in John F. Kennedy's campaigns;
the ``carpetbagger'' senator from New York; the candidate for
president who waited until Eugene McCarthy had led the way.
   ``Reputation for ruthlessness'' is even in the index of an
admiring biography by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.
   But Bobby Kennedy was also, according to Luella Hennessey, a
nurse who worked for the family, ``the most thoughtful and
considerate of the Kennedy children.''
   In a Roman Catholic family that lived for politics, he was the
one boy who might have become a priest.
   ``He's got high moral standards,'' brother John once said.
   Bobby was the passionate one, the brother of the greatest
intensity _ a brooding quality some found to be deeply Irish.
   ``My, he is unassimilated, isn't he?'' the poet Robert Lowell
remarked after meeting him.
   Bobby first channeled that passion into college football, then
into service as an indefatigable aide to congressional committees
and his brother's campaigns. Finally, bereft of the brother he
idolized, he became a passionate advocate of civil rights and, after
years of backing the war, an opponent of the bloodshed in Vietnam.
   ``Bobby resembles me more than any of the other children,''
patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy once said. ``He had the same capacity
for likes and dislikes, for love and hate.''
   Robert Francis was the seventh of nine Kennedy children, 10 years
younger than Joe Jr. and eight years younger than Jack. ``When you
come from that far down,'' he once said, ``you have to struggle to
survive.''
   He was the smallest of the four boys, accident-prone and clumsy
but determined to keep up.
   Unhappy at his slow progress in learning to swim, young Bobby
tried to learn all at once by jumping off a yawl into Nantucket
Sound, where he thrashed until Joe pulled him out.
   ``It showed either a lot of guts or no sense at all, depending on
how you looked at it,'' said Jack.
   Herbert Stokinger, his football coach at Milton Academy,
recalled: ``Bob (at only 160 pounds) loved to crunch. ... He loved
to hit his man. And when he hit, he seemed to come alive.''
   ``Bobby was an all-out,'' said Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas, who took the young attorney along on a visit to the Soviet
Union in 1955. ``If he was climbing a peak or hiking a trail, there
was nothing else in the world to do but that.''
   Schlesinger, author of ``Robert Kennedy and His Times,'' traces
the reputation for ruthlessness to Jack Kennedy's campaign for the
Senate in 1952. Bobby, the campaign manager, once booted a local
labor leader out of the office, saying, ``If you're not going to
work, don't hang around here.''
   When Jack Kennedy decided he didn't want to wage a joint campaign
with Massachusetts Gov. Paul Dever, he sent his brother to deliver
the bad news. ``Don't give it (the joint campaign) to them,'' Jack
told him, ``but don't get me involved in it.''
   ``Jack Kennedy,'' Dever reflected after the campaign, which he
lost, ``is the first Irish Brahmin. Bobby is the last Irish
puritan.''
   Bobby played a similar role in the presidential campaign of 1960.
``Inside the campaign he was the tireless investigator and goad,''
Schlesinger wrote, ``responsible for everything but the speeches.
Outside he became the man to do the harsh jobs, saying no, telling
people off, whipping the reluctant and recalcitrant into line.''
   Well before the 1960 campaign, Bobby had earned a national
reputation as a relentless investigator.
   In 1952, his father arranged for him to work for Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, the crusading anti-communist who headed the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Government Operations
Committee.
   McCarthy had made the acquaintance of the Kennedy family after
coming to Washington in 1947, and had won the admiration and support
of fellow Irishman Joseph Kennedy.
   McCarthy made Bobby an assistant counsel _ one of 15 _ to his
young chief counsel, Roy Cohn. Kennedy's major work was a report
detailing that three-fourths of the cargos reaching China were on
Western-flag ships _ this at the time China was sponsoring the
Communist side in the Korean War.
   The committee's more famous work, the hunt for subversives within
the government, was energetically led by Cohn and G. David Schine.
   ``Cohn and Schine claimed they knew from the outset what was
wrong, and they were not going to allow the facts to interfere,''
said Kennedy, who resigned from the committee after six months.
   At this time in his life, Bobby made a disagreeable impression
even on some friends of the family. Theodore Sorenson, Jack's
speechwriter, found the younger brother to be ``militant,
aggressive, intolerant, opinionated, somewhat hollow in his
convictions.''
   Bobby returned to the Government Operations Committee in 1954 as
counsel for the minority Democrats, resuming his fencing matches
with Cohn. On June 11, in the acidic Army-McCarthy hearings, Kennedy
and Cohn nearly came to blows in the hearing room in what one
newspaper headline called a ``Hate Clash.''
   Even after McCarthy was censured in 1954, Bobby felt a personal
loyalty to the Republican from Wisconsin; in 1955 he walked out on a
speech by Edward R. Murrow, who had denounced McCarthy in a famous
CBS broadcast.
   Kennedy became majority counsel of the investigations committee,
under Sen. John L. McClellan, after Democrats regained control of
the Senate in 1954. First he went after Teamsters president Dave
Beck, and then Jimmy Hoffa, who led the union after Beck was
convicted of tax evasion.
   Kennedy's pursuit of Hoffa was bitter and personal, on both
sides, and continued when Kennedy became attorney general in his
brother's administration. Hoffa called Kennedy ``a young,
dim-witted, curly-headed smart-aleck.''

   In the Kennedy administration, Bobby was not only the attorney
general, but was also acknowledged as the president's closest
adviser. That closeness was, in some ways, a union of opposites.
   ``John Kennedy was the more secure, the freer, of the two _ freer
of his father, of his family, of his faith, of the entire
Irish-American predicament,'' Schlesinger wrote. ``... The two
brothers had moved in different directions in adolescence and young
manhood. John establishing his intellectuality, Robert his
toughness. John his independence, Robert his commitment to the
family.''
   Devastated by his brother's death, Bobby struck his associates as
withdrawn, almost shrunken. He adopted his brother's habit of
smoking cigars and began carrying around one of JFK's old coats. He
read Greek tragedies and the work of Albert Camus, and turned to an
old passion _ football.
   ``Everybody was trying to get the hate and the anger out of their
systems,'' Pierre Salinger, JFK's old press secretary, told Lester
and Irene David, authors of ``Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Folk
Hero.''
   ``Bobby was absolutely relentless,'' Salinger said. ``He attacked
the man with the ball like a tiger, slamming, bruising and crushing,
and so did everyone else. One guy broke a leg, and you couldn't
count the bloodied noses and contusions.''
   Bobby's own political campaigns were preceded by long bouts of
indecision. He didn't announce his candidacy for the Senate in New
York until the latter half of August 1964, although he wound up
winning easily.
   Because he was a Kennedy, there was always talk _ some hopeful,
some despairing _ that he would someday run for president.
   He remained an enigma _ something the cartoonist Jules Feiffer
ridiculed in 1967 as ``the Bobby twins.''
   ``The Good Bobby is a fervent civil libertarian. The Bad Bobby is
a fervent wiretapper,'' the cartoon said, adding: ``If you want one
Bobby to be your president, you will have to take both ... for
Bobbies are widely noted for their family unity.''
   Bobby wavered again in 1968 before jumping into the presidential
race, days after Sen. Eugene McCarthy had run a close second to
President Lyndon Johnson in the New Hampshire primary.
   ``It is hard to forgive Kennedy his shy, calculating delay in
declaring himself, or forgive the shaggy rudeness of his final
entrance,'' Lowell said in Oregon, even though he affirmed his
admiration for the man.
   Jacqueline Kennedy worried in the spring of 1968: ``Do you know
what I think will happen to Bobby? The same thing that happened to
Jack. ... There is so much hatred in this country, and more people
hate Bobby than hated Jack.''
   On the night he won the California primary, Bobby spoke for a
moment with Kenneth O'Donnell, a long-time Kennedy friend.
   ``You know, Kenny,'' he said, ``I feel now for the first time
that I've shaken off the shadow of my brother.''
   Within hours, he was dead.

   The search by American crab fishermen for new,
more productive seas combined with the Soviet Union's interest in
U.S. fishing technology has netted both sides a new fishing
agreement.
   Last week, President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
signed an agreement allowing for joint fishing, management and
conservation in the North Pacific.
   Members of the Alaska Crab Coalition and other American fisheries
groups had negotiated with the Soviet Union for more than a year in
an effort to get an agreement that would allow U.S. fishermen access
to the western Bering Sea.
   Ronald K. Peterson, Seattle-based owner of a crab boat and
president of the Alaska coalition, hopes U.S. crabbers will be able
to forge joint venture agreements with Soviet enterprises and fish
in Soviet water this year. Three Soviet ports would be opened to
American fishermen, he said.
   While U.S. bottomfish fishermen also hope eventually to cast nets
in Soviet waters for pollock, cod and other species, the agreement
with the Soviets is seen as especially beneficial for the crabbers.
   After a big fleet buildup to pursue huge stocks of crab in the
American sector of the Bering Sea in the 1970s, crab populations
dwindled around 1980 for a variety of reasons, including disease and
predators.
   ``In 1980, we took 130 million pounds of red king crab in the
Bering Sea, with 236 boats participating,'' Peterson said. ``Last
year, we had the same number of boats, and they took a little over
12 million pounds.''
   Crab boats cost $2.5 million new and owners need to pull up
$4,000 to $5,000 worth of crabs daily just to break even, said Arni
Thomson, executive director of the coalition, which represents 80
Bering Sea crab boats.
   Peterson said that, initially, 30 American crab boats would
probably be allowed in Soviet waters. Thomson said the Soviets
probably would process the catch.
   The Soviets, said Thomson, will benefit by having greater access
to under-utilized fish species in U.S. fishing areas and by the use
of superior American fishing technology.
   As an example, he said, American crabbers the past five years
have developed new methods of harvesting deep-dwelling snow crab.
Pots are strung together, perhaps 20 at a time, he said, and then
pulled up at once on a common marking buoy _ a departure from the
usual method of each pot being placed separately.
   ``The Soviets do not have that expertise and that is a very
important fishery now to us,'' Thomson said.
   Thomson said he expected that the benefits for American crews of
fishing off Siberia will be over the long term and will provide
stability to the Bering Sea crab fishery.
   The Bering Sea reportedly is the richest bottomfish ground in the
world. Two million metric tons are taken annually on the U.S. side
of the sea, and the Soviet side apparently has an equal-size
resource, said Ted Evans, executive director of the Alaska Factory
Trawler Association in Seattle.
   The loser in the new cooperative agreements could be Japan's
fishermen, who for decades had both Soviet and U.S. waters in the
North Pacific almost to themselves.
   ``The belief (by Americans and Soviets alike) is that Japan has
been a good trading partner, but the Soviets and Americans want
another trading partner in each other, for the competition,''
Peterson said.

   Clarence M. Pendleton, chairman of the U.S.
Civil Rights Commission and one of the highest-ranking black
officials in government, died of an apparent heat attack Sunday
after exercising, officials said. He was 57.
   President Reagan selected Pendleton, an opponent of affirmative
action quotas and busing, to head the commission in November 1981
after firing Arthur S. Flemming. Flemming, the chairman since 1974,
criticized Reagan's civil rights policies as ``in conflict with the
Constitution.''
   Pendleton called affirmative action ``divisive, unpopular and
immoral'' and opposed federal set-aside contracts for minority-owned
businesses.
   The bipartisan Civil Rights Commission monitors the enforcement
of civil rights laws within the federal government. It lacks
policy-making or enforcement powers and serves only as an advisory
body.
   Pendleton is survived by his second wife, Margrit; a son and two
daughters.

   Developer Ira Kirkorian, a Central Valley
farmer who became known for building custom homes, office complexes
and shopping malls, died Saturday of cancer. He was 77.
   Born on Oct. 11, 1910, in Madera, Kirkorian graduated from high
school during the Depression and went into farming. He decided to
build homes on Freson lots he bought after watching some being built
nearby.
   He gave up farming and built homes and apartments in Fresno over
the next seven years. When he retired in 1981, he had developed nine
shopping and automotive centers in the region.

   The magnitude of a trillion-dollar
deficit is a little more comprehensible to David Witte and his
sixth-grade classmates after they tried but failed to collect 1
million bottle caps and pull-tabs.
   Frank Heatwole's students finished the year-long project with
624,720 of the caps and tabs from drink containers.
   ``A million is a lot more than a person thinks,'' David said,
adding that the U.S. government ``is not a million dollars or a
billion but a trillion dollars in debt.''
   Classmate Jay Lippincott agreed.
   ``When I think about a trillion, I don't want to think of it. We
tried and we only got half a million,'' he said. ``I thought we
could do it.''
   The project produced overflowing boxes and barrels of caps and
tabs in the corner of the Lincoln Elementary School classroom.
   Students got friends and relatives to help by donating the caps
or tabs.
   Julie Higgenbothom said organization was the key to collecting so
many items.
   ``I've gotten lots of friends to help, and when you get
organized, it's a snap,'' she said.
   Angela Swartout got both her parents involved. Her mother brought
in a box containing 6,000 tabs and her father contributed a 40-pound
bag of them.
   Restaurants and taverns also helped.
   When collecting ended last week, the 400 pounds of caps and 602
pounds of tabs were taken to a recycling company, which paid the
class $315 for them.
   Part of the proceeds went for a class lunch of pizza. Students
were considering what they wanted to buy with the rest.

<HEAD>Western Drought Threatens Duck Populations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's drought in the West is grim news
for North American ducks, battered throughout the 1980s by bad
weather in breeding areas, warns the Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Drought is hurting prime duck breeding areas in the Dakotas,
Alaska, Montana and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and British Columbia, not only by drying up marshy
areas where ducks breed, but by enticing cattle to graze in areas
they normally wouldn't reach and by leading farms to put such areas
under the plow.
   ``The situation looks grim,'' said Frank Dunkle, director of the
service.
   If preliminary results of the annual survey of nesting areas,
done in cooperation with Canadian authorities, are borne out later
this summer, the service will have to ``take a hard look'' at
hunting regulations for the fall, he said.
   The survey of duck broods in July forms the basis for each year's
hunting regulations. In 1985, the survey cut seasons and bag limits
sharply.
   Duck populations in the survey areas used to range well above 40
million, but they fell in the 1980s to an all-time low of 30 million
in 1985 before rebounding slightly to 34 million to 35 million.
   Bob Blohm, assistant chief of the survey branch, said in a
telephone interview from the services's Patuxent, Md., research
station that results were still coming in from this year's survey,
particularly from northerly areas. He said he could not predict what
the final count will be, but the prospect for a large number of
offspring this year is dim.
   Many ducks returning from the South this spring, discovering
their normal breeding areas drier than normal, may have found
nesting areas farther north. ``There is a question, though, of how
productive they are when they do that,'' Blohm said.
   ``Many areas experienced a mild, dry fall and winter followed by
low precipitation and strong winds this spring,'' according to a
statement by the service. ``In southern Canada, poor conditions
began as early as last summer when less than one-third of the
prairie region received normal precipitation. ... It is believed
rainfall this late in the spring probably will not help much because
the ground is so dry it will just soak up the water.
   ``One study in a five-square-mile area around Woodworth, N.D.,
indicated that only 38 percent of the basins had water,'' and those
levels were low, the service said. ``Old Wives Lake in south-central
Saskatchewan is dry for the first time since 1937. ... Whitewater
Lake in southwest Manitoba, traditionally an important areas for
ducks, is only a quarter full.''
   The service said biologists were reporting ``congregations of
ducks crowding into what water remains, often with little nesting
cover.''

<HEAD>Ohio, New York Reach Agreement On Coal-Related Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governors of Ohio and New York have
agreed on an approach to fighting acid rain that balances the
interests of coal-producing states and environmental preservation,
officials said Sunday night.
   Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal from such
states as Ohio long have been blamed as a major cause of acid rain,
which environmentalists say is destroying waters and woodlands in
the Northeast.
   Gov. Richard Celeste's press secretary, Debra Phillips, said the
agreement, which she termed an outline at this point, is a proposal
to Congress and would be unveiled Monday. She said the next step is
for Celeste and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to meet with congressional
leaders.
   The New York Times quoted Cuomo in its Monday editions as calling
the agreement ``a reasonable and imaginative effort to resolve our
differences and solve the problem of acid rain.'' He said he would
``push hard and will keep pushing'' to achieve a national program to
deal with the issue.
   Celeste considers the agreement ``a balance between preserving
jobs and cleaning up the environment,'' Ms. Phillips said.
   State Sen. Bob Ney, a Republican, said the agreement is a ``hard
slap across the face'' of Ohio's coal miners.
   Ney said Celeste has promised some form of sulfur dioxide
emission reductions to fellow Democrat Cuomo, possibly in exchange
for New York's dropping of a federal lawsuit that attempts to force
emission reductions in coal-burning states.
   ``I've been told that Ohio was agreeing to some reduction over a
period of years,'' Ney said. ``For Celeste to do this, he would
either have to do it by executive order or ask the Ohio Legislature
to do it. He would have run into a brick wall there.''
   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Richard Shank would
not discuss details Sunday night, but he said the agreement ``enters
on clean-coal technology and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions ...
and also nitrogen oxide, which also is a contributor to acid rain.''
   He said the lawsuit is not involved in the agreement.
   Shank said Ohio and New York officials met over several months
``and came up with common ground on acid rain.''
   ``I wasn't too optimistic going into it, but after months of work
on it, we finally came up with something,'' Shank said. ``It looks
at it (acid rain) as a national problem.''
   In Albany, N.Y., Cuomo's chief spokesman, Gary Fryer, said the
proposal stemmed from a discussion between the two governors last
July at a meeting of the national Democratic Governors' Association
on Mackinac Island, Mich.
   Fryer said New York and Ohio officials have been negotiating for
``several months'' on the acid rain issue. Fryer said the agreement
will involve emissions blamed for acid rain not just from Ohio but
from other states as well.
   If approved by Congress, ``it'll reduce emissions everywhere,''
he said.

<HEAD>Summit A Symbol Of Hope For Immigrants In Little Odessa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the world's politicians weigh the fourth
superpower summit, some Russian immigrants living on a mile-long
slice of Brooklyn seashore already have declared it a success.
   They judge it so not because of any great strides in human rights
or arms control but because it is a symbol of hope _ a sign that
change is possible.
   Inside Brighton Beach's White Acia delicatessen, where American
cookies are sold alongside hot ponchicks and kbac _ Russian versions
of knishes and apple cider _ Simon Feldman is cautiously optimistic.
   ``You cannot be very optimistic because of the communist
system,'' Feldman says, wiping his hands on an already stained apron.
   ``But (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev is really one of the
stars we've been looking for. We really want him to succeed,''
Feldman said.
   Feldman is one of an estimated 35,000 Russian Jews who left their
country and settled in this once aging and economically depressed
ocean community.
   The immigrants are credited with breathing new life into the
neighborhood, which is sandwiched between Coney Island and
Sheepshead Bay. Their presence is so strong that the community is
now called ``Little Odessa,'' after the Ukrainian city on the Black
Sea.
   ``The main thing which is our concern is for peace,'' Feldman
said in halting English. While critics say the summit failed to
produce substantive arms control agreements, Feldman said ``any
accomplishment means a lot.''
   Like Feldman, restaurateurs Misha Fiddler and Mark Rakhman, both
natives of Odessa, had high praise for Gorbachev.
   Rakhman, who owns the Russian nightclub National and a gourmet
delicatessen called M&I International, says the new spirit of
openness in the Soviet Union shows ``they're starting to make a
little progress.''
   ``It will get better, better and better,'' says Rakhman, leaning
against a case of Siberian red mustard, caviar and mushroom and
vegetable salads.
   The changes will not come overnight, says Rakhman, but over time.
``They (the Soviets) must grow again from the ground up.''
   Fiddler, who owns a fish store and boardwalk restaurant called
Moscow, agrees that Gorbachev is ``doing great things for Russia.''
   But as far as the summit is concerned, Fiddler said, it was
President Reagan who got what he wanted. ``He's a smart man. Today,
Reagan is buying from the Russians peace.''
   ``It's going to be peaceful for a long time,'' says Fiddler, an
admitted cynic. ``At least a year.''
   Though many of Brighton's Russian immigrants hailed the summit as
a step forward in the relationship between the United States and the
Soviet Union, Ilya Milman was not one of them.
   ``What can I tell you? I don't believe in Russia, that's all. I
don't believe,'' said Milman, putting aside the Hoboe Pycckoe Caobo
(New Russian Word) newspaper to offer his views.
   Milman, once a professional team handball coach in Kiev and now
manager of a local nightclub, says all he heard were words.
   ``Saying is nothing. They must do something,'' says Milman, a
coach for the U.S. Olympic handball team in the 1984 games. ``We
have no results.''
   He conceded the Soviet people have new freedoms but he says they
remain politically tethered.
   ``It's good that you can talk a little more freely now,'' said
Milman, dressed in a denim jacket sporting the Olympic logo. ``But
they're still told stay still, not too much.''
   As for Gorbachev, Milman says, ``on the outside, he's a little
bit changed but underneath it's the same. He's just wearing a new
face.''
   Milman would not call the summit a success and did not expect
immediate results.
   ``We must wait. In Russia, any change is for the best,'' he said.
``But we must wait.''

<HEAD>Farm Families Make Almost Half of Income Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barely more than half of U.S. farm families'
income came from farm earnings in 1986, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   Jobs in town and other off-farm sources provided the rest. In
fact, such earnings generated the bulk of the income for many farm
families, according to a coming article in USDA's Farmline magazine.
   Outside income has represented around half of what farm families
earn since 1960, at times surging to as much as 55 percent.
   Economist Mary Ahearn of USDA's Economic Research Service says
reliance on off-farm income is likely to be greatest on small farms.
On the smallest, more than 96 percent of total household income in
1986 came from outside sources.
   About two thirds of U.S. farms are small farms _ ones with less
than $40,000 in agricultural product sales. They cover about 30
percent of the nation's farmland but take in less than 10 percent of
crop and livestock sales.
   Less than 4 percent of their net cash income came from farming,
according to Economic Research Service statistics. The average in
1986 was about $950 a farm, according to the service.
   Mid-size farms, with less than $250,000 in farm product sales,
represented 23 percent of the farms and almost half of the land.
Their share of total U.S. sales was 37 percent.
   Such farms depend more on farm product sales than do smaller
ones. Seventy-five percent of earnings came from agriculture and 85
percent of the operators said their chief occupation was farming.
Off-farm income was the lowest of any group. It averaged $13,296.
   Mid-size farms are often viewed as the closest thing in real life
to the traditional image of the ``family farm.'' But 30 percent of
the families in the category had 1986 incomes below the poverty
level.
   Only 4 percent of U.S. farms fell into the large-farm category,
with gross sales topping $250,000. But they took up 24 percent of
the nation's farm land and their receipts accounted for 51 percent
of total marketings. Ninety-five percent of their income came from
farms, according to the report.
   Off-farm income for the group averaged $17,589 per household and
net cash farm incomes were $320,978 on average. ERS researchers
themselves, however, say that is likely to be an overestimate.
   Even among large farmers, however, 20 percent of the households
were estimated to have incomes below the poverty level. Ahearn said
that figure should not be surprising, since farming is a risky
business with high variation in incomes owing to drought, price
drops and poor investments.
   Among the various kinds of farmers, fruit and nut producers were
No. 1 in total off-farm income with an average of $43,365. General
and miscellaneous livestock producers were next with $26,333. Dairy
producers had the lowest average off-farm income: $6,525.
   Average off-farm incomes were more than $20,000 in much of the
nation but below that figure in the Corn Belt, Appalachia, the Lake
States and the Northern Plains. Many of the states where families
were most dependent on off-farm income were in the South, the report
said.

   Soviet grain production could reach 215 million
tons this year, Agriculture Department economists say.
   Production at that level would surpass each of the previous two
years and mark the first time ever that Soviet production was above
200 million tons for three straight years, according to a recent
agricultural outlook summary.
   It said that the amount of area planted in grain has increased
only a bit since last year, when the total was not particularly
high, but that yield could reach record levels set in 1978.
   Coarse grain production is actually expected to drop from last
year's levels but wheat could be in for a 10 percent gain, the
forecast said. It said imports most likely would be down from last
year's levels.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and Soviet inspectors are set to begin
the historic job of verifying compliance with the medium-range
missile treaty signed, sealed and delivered by President Reagan and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We're set. We're ready to go,'' said Ken Pease, a spokesman for
the On-Site Inspection Agency, the new office set up by the Pentagon
to make sure the Soviets comply with the requirements of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The Soviet Union and the United States will have the same rights
of inspection, which will include on-site checks for the first time
in the history of superpower arms control efforts.
   The treaty provides that the inspections can begin 30 days after
the pact takes effect. That clock began ticking Wednesday at the
Moscow summit, when Reagan and the Soviet leader exchanged
ratification documents for the pact they signed Dec. 8.
   The major item on this summer's agenda is a series of
``baseline'' inspections during a 60-day period beginning July 1.
Those inspections will establish the basic data for all facilities
covered by the treaty.
   The United States will have the right to inspect 133 sites,
including 126 in the Soviet Union, six in East Germany and one in
Czechoslovakia. The Soviets, in turn, will have the right to examine
14 sites in the United States and another dozen U.S. facilities in
western Europe.
   The inspections will be conducted by 20 teams of up to 10 persons
each, according to the treaty. Pease said the American teams have
been training for months. ``We're ready; our teams are ready,'' he
said.
   In late June, the United States will begin moving teams of
inspectors to Frankfurt, West Germany, in preparation for the
inspections.
   Details of how the inspections are to be conducted are spelled
out in great detail by the INF treaty, Pease noted. For example, the
American teams can arrive through four ``portals,'' including two in
the Soviet Union, one in East Germany and one in Czechoslovakia.
   Once the inspection team lands, it has between four and 48 hours
to tell the Soviets which site it wants to check. The Soviets then
have nine hours to move the team to the facility, followed by a
one-hour briefing. The inspectors have 24 hours to complete their
job, but the time can be extended to 32 hours by mutual agreement.
   The Soviets have exactly the same rights, under the same terms,
Pease noted.
   The two sides have conducted three sets of technical talks to
work out the details. For example, among the items already
negotiated are the size, color and words that will be printed on the
identification tags worn by the inspection teams, the types of
identification that will be attached to the inspectors' luggage, and
whether the inspectors will bring binoculars or have them supplied.
   In addition to preparing for the inspections, the American agency
will also escort the Soviet inspectors as they tour American sites.
   The Americans will be commanded by Army Brig. Gen. Roland LaJoie,
who speaks Russian and whose career has been chiefly in intelligence
efforts.
   He is a former U.S. military attache at the American embassy in
Moscow and is a former commander of a special U.S. liaison unit in
East Germany. That unit was spotlighted in March 1985 when one of
its members, Army Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson, was shot and killed by a
Soviet sentry.
   LaJoie's background highlights one of the side issues which will
be part of the inspections _ the battle over intelligence gathering.
   Inspectors on both sides will be watching to pick up whatever
stray information they can which could be of military value. For
example, Soviet inspectors will be stationed outside the Magna,
Utah, plant of Hercules, Inc. The plant was one of the production
sites of the Pershing II missile _ now banned by the treaty _ but
other missiles are also produced there, including stages of the MX,
Midgetman, and Trident.
   ``Any incidental information that can be learned is fair game,
for both sides,'' said one official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   In addition to the baseline inspections in July, both sides can
begin destroying missiles under terms of the pact which provides for
the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of
300 to 3,400 miles.
   The Soviets have identified eight sites where they plan to
eliminate some of the 5,200 items they will have to destroy,
including missile stages, launchers and related equipment. Up to
five of those sites may be in continuous use, according to the
Soviets, and they will be watched by U.S. inspection teams.
   The United States hasn't yet identified the sites where it will
destroy its Pershing II and ground-launched missiles, but it must
give the Soviets a list by the end of June.
   Each side will have on-site inspection rights for 13 years,
including short-notice inspections.

   For many of the Americans getting their first peek
at the Kremlin during last week's summit, one surprise was simply
aesthetic.
   The Kremlin _ as in ``President Reagan rattled the Kremlin with
his demand that ...'' _ conjures up the image of a big, no-nonsense,
government-issue office building with which we would all be familiar
except that it is hidden behind suffocating security.
   Like the Pentagon, for example, or the General Motors Building.
   Moscow has more than its share of these sorts of structures, but
the Kremlin isn't one of them.
   The Kremlin is a complex of antique buildings framed by an
imposing red-brick wall. It includes breathtaking, centuries-old
cathedrals, many of them highlighted by gilt-painted onion domes.
Several ornate palaces _ Italian-renaissance yellow, not government
gray _ have passed from the czars to become offices of the
commissars. The grounds are lavish, and at least in late May they
are green and beautiful. The red flags always wave, and the red star
shines bright above several spectacular gates.
   Much of the Kremlin is off limits, but some of it is not.
Tourists stroll through. Russians use it as a shortcut to work.
Brides, still wearing their dresses and veils, stop by and leave
their wedding-day flowers at memorials to Russia's war dead.
   ``This is ground zero?'' asked one American journalist, a fellow
who found it incongruous to consider that if the bombing ever
starts, the White House and the Kremlin will be the first to go,
wedding-day flowers or not.

   Then there is the KGB.
   U.S. officials provided every sort of briefing prior to the
summit. Journalists were steeped in subjects ranging from arms
control to Soviet agricultural trends since collectivization. Moscow
cognoscenti added their expertise on Politburo intrigues, not to
mention the best new cooperative restaurants and a buyers' guide to
the Beriozka gift shops.
   But no one wanted to talk about the KGB.
   Is my hotel room bugged? Are we being followed? Is the taxi
driver a spy? What about the friendly teen-ager we saw near the
Arbat shopping mall, and then again near Red Square? He wants to
trade his rubles for dollars _ at a very good rate. Is this a setup?
   The summiteers have all left, well fed and unscathed, and so now
the truth can be told. The KGB was on its best boy-scout behavior.
Border guards seemed benign and friendly. Passport clerks wielded
rubber stamps. There was little sign of bugging, following or
planting of false evidence.
   Nonetheless, the KGB made its presence felt.
   Physically, it seemed to be everywhere. If there were eight doors
to a summit hotel, seven would be locked and four security men would
be checking IDs at No. 8. You had the impression that Maxwell Smart
I was checking the IDs while Maxwell Smart II was checking on
Maxwell Smart I. And so on.
   On several occasions, reporters seeking your basic
man-on-the-street interviews were told by Moscow residents, in so
many words: Are you crazy? Asking me about Reagan? Those two guys
over there, they are KGB. How do I know you're not KGB, too?
   Others were only too eager to talk. Glasnost seemed to be
trickling down, slowly but surely.

   President Reagan raised eyebrows by stopping in London en route
home.
   After four nights in Helsinki and four nights in Moscow, you'd
think he'd want to get home to his own bed. But once in merry old
England, it seemed possible that presidential planners may simply
have hoped the stopover would draw attention to the Bolshevik way of
life.
   London is everything Moscow is not. Single-family homes. Colorful
office buildings. Benign bobbies. Shopping to beat the band. More
shopping to beat the band. New construction! Jaywalking.
   Yet there were hints of an imminent outbreak of fashion among the
young ladies of Moscow. Return visitors were impressed to be see
some miniskirts and patterned stockings and ``shoulders.''

   ``I am delighted to be in a country,'' one traveler said upon
arriving in England, ``which accepts its own currency.''
   The Soviets make it pretty near impossible for a foreigner to do
serious business in rubles. The Soviets want dollars, or pounds, or
the Finnish Markaa _ any denomination that has value in world
markets.
   The ruble is not traded outside Soviet borders, for fear it will
lose its value, and the Soviets need international exchange to pay
for import goods. Hotels and restaurants and souvenir shops that
cater to visitors invariably will accept no business from Soviet
citizens and no rubles from anyone.

<HEAD>IMF Chief Presses Countries to Mesh Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and other big countries
should coordinate economic policy because no single government can
any longer underwrite world prosperity, the head of the
International Monetary Fund urged today.
   Managing Director Michel Camdessus was apparently referring to
attempts to mesh major economic policy among the Group of Seven,
known as G-7. That includes the United States, Britain, West
Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and his native France. The Soviet
Union is not among the fund's 151 member governments.
   ``The relative strength of the European Community and Japan has
grown, making the U.S. economy a less dominant force than it once
was,'' Camdessus said.
   ``Indeed, no single government can any longer underwrite
prosperity or stability for the world as a whole.''
   Economists say, for example, that it would be disastrous if all
members of G-7 made an all-out effort to increase their exports to
one another at the same time.
   Efforts to tighten coordination have been discouraged by events
following last year's agreement in Paris that the price of the
dollar had fallen enough. After that came October's stock market
crash and the continued fall of the dollar.
   Camdessus said it may never be possible to get total agreement
among governments at any given time, but it should be possible to
make their policies more compatible.
   ``Unless a satisfactory answer can be given to the question
`what's in it for us?' cooperation will be at best insubstantial,''
he said.
   He listed cases where national policies, urged for the benefit of
the world as a whole, could in his view also help the countries that
adopt them. Camdessus said that:
   _More reduction of the U.S. budget deficit would enable the
United States to sell more of its goods abroad without crowding out
U.S. private spending or spurring inflation. He said it also would
pave the way for lasting reductions in interest rates and make it
easier for future U.S. governments to be more flexible about taxes
and government spending
   _Western Europe and Japan should be vigorous about ``structural
reforms'' which would speed up both their growth and the growth of
the rest of the world. He did not give details, but western Europe
and Japan have been repeatedly urged to turn attention away from
exports and produce more for home markets.
   _If some newly industrialized countries gradually reduced their
big surpluses in world trade, they and the world would both be
helped. Again Camdessus did not explain, but Taiwan and South Korea
have been frequently advised to do some of the same restructuring
recommended to Japan and western Europe.
   _Heavily indebted countries should be more resolute about making
sound policies and needed reforms, backed for debt reductions and
new loans from creditor countries.
   Camdessus' speech was prepared for an international monetary
conference in Chicago, and copies were distributed by his Washington
headquarters to reporters here.

<HEAD>New Jersey Governor Offers `Inclusion' To Bush Campaign</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One in a series of occasional profiles of vice presidential
prospects</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In seeking the presidency, George Bush may
take a page from the new book by New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean.
   Kean's modern, moderate Republicanism _ as outlined in his
autobiographical book ``The Politics of Inclusion'' _ has caught
Bush's eye.
   That, along with the popular governor's growing national profile,
has put Kean on the so-called short list of potential Bush running
mates.
   The 51-year-old Kean, approaching the end of his second and last
gubernatorial term, is in many ways an automatic contender for the
national ticket.
   Bush, campaigning last month in New Jersey, said, ``Would he have
the qualifications for national office? The answer is clearly yes.''
   As the uncontested head of the Republican Party in his state,
Kean is in a position to deliver a hefty 16 electoral college votes
in November _ enough to get any presidential candidate's attention.
   In 1985, Kean was re-elected by the largest margin in state
history, with unprecedented support among blacks and other
minorities.
   He has headed the Republican Governors Association, and gained
national recognition for his programs. President Reagan, in the
State of the Union message this year, singled out Kean's education
reforms.
   Despite these credentials, many political observers believe the
governor is at best a long shot to round out the Bush ticket.
   Among those voicing the most doubt is Kean himself. He says he's
not campaigning for the job, and doesn't expect to be asked.
   ``I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not doing anything to
make it happen,'' he insisted in Washington last month.
   Obvious problems with a Kean candidacy are his similarities to
Bush. The two have similar patrician backgrounds.
   Bush went to Yale, while Kean attended Princeton. Bush is the
scion of a wealthy Connecticut family; Kean's family amassed a
fortune in real estate and utilities.
   Bush is the son of a U.S. senator; Kean's family tree includes
his congressman father, the late Robert Kean. A grandfather and
great-uncle served in the Senate. Further back, Kean's ancestors
include New Jersey's first constitutional governor and John Kean, a
contemporary of George Washington.
   The idea of Kean on the national ticket is unpopular with many
GOP conservatives. Kean is moderate, even liberal on some issues
held sacred by the right. He has frequently and openly broken with
President Reagan.
   Kean was first elected governor in 1981, beating Rep. James
Florio, D-N.J., by a margin of less than 1,800 votes. The contest
was so close that the winner remained uncertain for weeks.
   After a stormy first year, marked by a sagging economy and
uncertainty on the new governor's staff, Kean gradually built
support that has since earned him high approval ratings.
   The governor has an aggressive public-relations operation, topped
by his prominent presence in tourism commercials for the state of
New Jersey, which are broadcast nationally.
   Kean makes no secret about wanting to play a role at the GOP
convention, and in the fall campaign. He has already been called to
Bush's office for advice, and made it clear he would welcome an
invitation to deliver a speech at the convention.

<HEAD>Bush Differs With Administration On Offshore Drilling Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, facing a tough fight to carry
California in the fall presidential election, is bidding for support
from environmentalists by differing with the Reagan administration's
policy on offshore oil drilling.
   The vice president was in California today, on the eve of the
state's presidential primary. He already has more than enough
delegates for the Republican presidential nomination.
   A day earlier, the vice president stepped away from the
administration approach when he advocated a delay in a controversial
project off the Northern California coast.
   ``We must be assured that the national treasure of the California
coastline will not be harmed,'' he said.
   The administration is pushing to end the moratorium on drilling
off the coast, a position bitterly opposed by environmentalists.
   Opponents of ending the moratorium include many Republicans,
including Sen. Pete Wilson.
   The environment traditionally is a strong political issue in
California.
   In the past, Bush has said offshore drilling must adhere to
strict environmental standards, but he has not opposed the
administration plan to end the moratorium.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, told reporters on the flight
to California that the vice president was not advocating continuing
an absolute moratorium.
   Bush limited his difference on the question to Lease Sale 91, a
large area off the northern coast.
   ``It appears that drilling in this environmentally precious area
would not add substantially to our energy reserves,'' he said,
during remarks at the dedication of the nation's first commercial
methanol fuel pump at a gasoline station.
   Methanol is an alternative fuel derived from coal and natural
gas. Bush said methanol offers better, cleaner performance than
gasoline at no greater cost. However, cars must be adapted to use
the fuel.
   Bush said he would support legislation in Congress that would
give auto companies an incentive to produce cars that use
alternative fuels.
   The vice president spoke at an ARCO station at Wilshire and
Hobart boulevards. He pumped a couple of gallons of methanol into a
Chevrolet and then a Ford.
   Bush, who doesn't often have occasion to use self-service pumps,
then drove the Chevrolet around the back of the gas station to where
his limousine was parked.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the all-but-certain
Democratic presidential nominee, supports continuing the moratorium.
   A new California Poll, conducted by the Field Institute, said
last week that Dukakis is favored over Bush by California voters by
a margin of 53 percent to 40 percent. The survey of 926 California
voters was conducted May 16-22.
   ``George Bush recognizes the importance of environmental and
quality of life issues in California,'' said Fuller.
   He said Bush wants Lease Sale 91 ``deferred until next year,
giving his secretary of the interior an opportunity to study the
matter and determine whether or not to go further.''
   No specific request for a delay has been made of Interior
Secretary Donald P. Hodel, Fuller said.
   In his speech, Bush noted that he had been in the business of
supplying oil drilling equipment for wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``I know it can be done safely,'' he said. ``But there are other
important considerations _ tourism, marine life, aesthetics _ and in
some extraordinarily sensitive areas, those considerations may
prevail until technology moves forward.''

<HEAD>Is the Gun Lobby Losing Its Clout?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle
Association says 70 senators and 260 representatives have never
voted against the gun lobby's positions, but a last-minute NRA
about-face is probably responsible for preserving that record.
   ``I think their influence has deteriorated some,'' says Sen. J.
James Exon, a conservative Nebraska Democrat with a long record of
backing the NRA. His view is shared by the NRA's traditional
opponents, like Handgun Control, Inc., and NRA's more recent
antagonists, the nation's major law enforcement organizations.
   Exon, who parted with the organization over a bill to ban plastic
guns that could escape detection at airport metal detectors, said a
recent meeting he had with LaPierre subtly communicated that point.
   As the NRA's political chief, LaPierre makes frequent visits to
Capitol Hill, but Exon says their meeting on May 27 was anything but
routine.
   The NRA never apologizes for the harsh attacks it makes on
lawmakers opposing its positions. But here was LaPierre _ according
to Exon's recollection _ admitting the group had gone too far in
attacking him for breaking ranks.
   LaPierre, director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action,
denies his comments to Exon amounted to an apology, and rejects any
view that the pro-gun group has lost a step.
   ``Our base is as good as gold,'' LaPierre says. ``We're going to
be in good shape as long as there are 70 million Americans who own
guns and 25 million who hunt. There are 70 senators and 260 House
members who have never voted against us.''
   But Exon described a different mood: ``They indicated to me they
had fallen down badly in communications. They said they were going
to do everything they could to remedy that. They said they may have
overreacted in the type of advertising and letter-writing to my
constituents.''
   While Exon believes the NRA has lost influence by attacking its
friends, the group's political opponents cite other reasons for
their view. Among them:
   _The NRA's switch from opposition to support of the bill to ban
undetectable plastic guns, legislation that is a top priority of gun
control and police groups and is sponsored by NRA nemesis Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   The NRA changed its mind after police groups successfully lobbied
Attorney General Edwin Meese III to support their version of the
measure, shaking the NRA's solid core of support in Congress.
   LaPierre says the NRA switched only after new language made clear
the bill would ban only still non-existent plastic handguns, not
existing metal pistols. ``A victory for the NRA,'' LaPierre says.
   _A stunning gun control triumph in Maryland, where Gov. William
Donald Schaefer, in a ceremony with some 200 police officers, signed
a bill May 27 to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday
Night Specials.
   LaPierre said the NRA's supporters have begun an effort,
successful in its early stages, to place a repeal referendum on the
ballot.
   _The Minnesota Senate Judiciary Committee's defeat of an
NRA-backed constitutional amendment proposal to clarify the right to
keep and bear arms. Also, the failure of the NRA in Wisconsin to win
passage of legislation that would have prohibited local governments
from passing any gun control law stricter than state law.
   LaPierre contends that state legislatures passed 18 NRA-backed
bills in 1986, 24 last year and 13 so far this year. ``There's only
one gun control bill that's gone through, and that's in Maryland,''
he says. ``It was our agenda being discussed in state legislatures,
not the other side's.''
   _In the 1986 congressional elections, not a single incumbent
targeted for defeat by the NRA lost his or her seat.
   LaPierre: ``It's very tough to defeat incumbents in Congress
these days. Most members of Congress who vote for gun control are in
safe districts and nobody's going to beat them. There are few
competitive districts left where the gun issue is the (major)
issue.''
   _In recent congressional battles and numerous state gun control
fights, the NRA and police groups have clashed bitterly. This has
given state lawmakers and members of Congress a political escape
hatch, allowing them to oppose the NRA by supporting their local
police.
   ``I don't see their relationship with police as ever being very
good again,'' says Jerald Vaughn, executive director of the
International Association of Chiefs of Police.
   LaPierre says he held meetings recently with ``three or four''
members of Congress, ``people who we felt were confused'' over the
early version of the plastic gun bill. ``They're still friends of
the NRA.''
   LaPierre's view of his meeting with Exon: ``I view it as
informational. If information is fence-mending, and fence-mending is
information, I guess you could interchange them.''
   Vaughn says of the NRA, ``They are by no means out of the
picture, but there are signs their stranglehold on this
administration and Congress is starting to loosen a bit. There's a
growing recognition in law enforcement the NRA is an organization
out of control. But politically, they're a savvy organization. They
make sure they're never in a position of having to admit defeat.''
   N.T. ``Pete'' Shields, chairman of Handgun Control Inc., says the
entry of law enforcement groups into the fray has been crucial.
   ``The NRA used to call us bleeding-heart communists, soft on
criminals,'' Shields says. ``Now, the whole law enforcement
community _ the guys on the firing line on the street _ is behind it
(the fight to control guns). It's not credible to think of those
people as bleeding-heart, liberal communists.''

<HEAD>Underdog Jackson Is Making Biggest Ad Push In California Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 primaries began with a bang of
forceful and often negative television advertising. But they are
ending with a whimper in California, where the winners of Tuesday's
presidential contests are a foregone conclusion.
   Vice President George Bush, with a lock on the Republican
nomination, isn't running any TV commercials at all in the state
with the biggest bloc of delegates at stake.
   And Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, running far ahead on the
Democratic side, expects to spend no more than a paltry $200,000 on
advertising.
   The only candidate mounting a substantial media effort is
underdog Jesse Jackson, who is spending $700,000 on television
commercials all over the state, plus airing a half-hour show
tonight, on the eve of the primary.
   Dukakis, with a 20-point lead over Jackson in a poll last week,
is limiting his advertising to Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   ``For those Democrats who are already interested in the election
and planning to vote, we would hope that a (TV) buy even this modest
would catch their attention and provide some information,'' said
Dukakis strategist Tom Kiley. ``We don't have any illusions. We
don't pretend that advertising is playing a major role in the
campaign.''
   The Dukakis campaign is running a biography and two anti-drug ads
as well as radio spots, some in Spanish, aimed at the black and
Hispanic communities.
   One TV ad features Dukakis saying he wants to ``wage a real war,
not a phony war, against drug and alcohol dependence in this
country. ... The chief executive can make a difference in the war
against drugs. I've done it in my state and I want to do it for
every state in this country.''
   Dukakis is also using a companion ad in which an announcer
describes the Massachusetts program and quotes federal agents as
calling it ``a model for the nation. ... He did it with hard work.
Integrity. Leadership. We could use some of that in the White
House.''
   Despite the clear focus on November, both Kiley and Alixe Glen, a
spokeswoman for Bush, said the ads do not give Dukakis an early edge
over the vice president in a state that will be pivotal in the
general election.
   ``Our advertising is so modest that it would be unrealistic to
think it would have any measurable impact in terms of creating an
advantage over Bush, or even having a really significant impact on
the primary outcome,'' Kiley said.
   Glen said Bush would counter any minimal effect of the Dukakis
ads through personal appearances in the state.
   Bush has spent all but a fraction of the $27 million legally
permitted for primary contestants and cannot afford to campaign in
any substantial way until after his party's convention in August.
   But Glen said the financial crunch did not figure in Bush's
decision to forgo a television effort in California. That was ``in
large part due to the fact that we have not had an opponent for so
long in the Republican Party,'' she said.
   Jackson's initial hopes of a California upset have faded, but he
is making a major push with an eye toward holding a strong hand at
the Democratic convention next month.
   Jackson's ads are running on cable, independent and network
affiliate stations in Fresno, Los Angeles, El Centro, Sacramento,
Salinas, Redding, Santa Barbara, Bakersfield, Palm Springs, San
Jose, San Francisco, Eureka, Monterey, San Diego, and Reno, Nev.
   Campaign manager Gerald Austin said Jackson started a new TV ad
campaign Saturday to raise money to pay off bills and cover
convention expenses. The 30-second spot airing in California
features a still photo of Jackson and an 800-number that viewers can
call to pledge money or put a contribution on their credit card ``to
keep hope alive,'' Austin said.
   Other Jackson spots are familiar, including one touting Jackson's
success in winning the release of an American pilot shot down in the
Middle East. An ad called ``We Need Him'' features farmers and is
showing in rural areas. Actress Eileen Brennan praises Jackson's
stands on women's issues in another spot.
   Jackson caps his California push tonight with a half-hour show in
all 15 markets, a program variously described by Jackson aides as a
retrospective, a celebration and an update. It will feature campaign
footage and a celebrity interviewing Jackson, along with a pitch for
votes and money.
   ``It will give people an update on what the campaign has
achieved,'' said spokesman Eric Easter. ``We want people to vote for
him with knowledge beyond what the media says. It will give our
perspective on him and the campaign.''

   Clarence M. Pendleton, chairman of the U.S.
Civil Rights Commission and one of the highest-ranking black
officials in government, died Sunday after collapsing while
exercising, officials said. He was 57.
   Pendleton died about 11 a.m. at Mission Bay Hospital after
efforts failed to revive him, said deputy coroner David Lodge.
Pendleton was believed to have suffered a heart attack, Lodge said.
   President Reagan selected Pendleton, an opponent of affirmative
action quotas and busing, to head the commission in November 1981
after firing Arthur S. Flemming. Flemming, the chairman since 1974,
criticized Reagan's civil rights policies as ``in conflict with the
Constitution.''
   The bipartisan Civil Rights Commission monitors the enforcement
of civil rights laws within the federal government. It lacks
policy-making or enforcement powers and serves only as an advisory
body.
   A White House spokesman, Bill Harlow, said he was aware that
Pendleton had died, but said the White House wouldn't have any
comment until the morning.
   ``He's going to be missed,'' Civil Rights Commission member
Robert A. Destro said. ``I don't think it's going to make any
difference whether people agreed with him or disagreed with him. He
was a great human being .... He was a very dynamic person.''
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson said Pendleton
``was an outstanding public servant and, like any American, he had
the right to express his point of view, which may not have been a
mainstream point of view.''
   Pendleton stirred wrath by calling liberal black leaders ``the
new racists'' whose support for the Democratic Party ``led blacks
into a political Jonestown.'' He described the concept of comparable
worth as ``the looniest idea since `Looney Tunes''' and said that
``relieving one's poverty is not civil rights.''
   He criticized the Civil Rights Restoration Act, passed earlier
this year over President Reagan's veto, as ``an unwarranted invasion
... by Big Brother.''
   He also called affirmative actions ``divisive, unpopular and
immoral'' and opposed federal set-aside contracts for minority-owned
businesses.
   Pendleton often was at odds with other commission members. The
commission voted 5-1 in 1982 to state that there had been
retrenchment and retreat in all areas of civil rights enforcement.
Pendleton was the lone dissenter.
   In June 1982, Pendleton argued there was little Reagan or any
president could do for urban areas until the economy and American
productivity improved.
   ``I believe in the trickle down theory because it (prosperity)
doesn't trickle up,'' he said.
   Pendleton maintained that black citizens must make it on the
merits of their own abilities without any special preference or
apologies from the government or the white power structure.
   He made a practice of giving so-called ``Uncivil Rights'' awards
to those whose actions furthered discrimination as he defined it.
The most recent went to Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer last month for
delaying the firing of an aide who made anti-Semitic remarks.
   Pendleton lived in the affluent community of La Jolla, about 10
miles north of downtown San Diego, with his second wife, Margrit,
and their young daughter.
   He commuted to Washington, D.C., and also frequently gave
speeches around the country.
   Pendleton battled high blood pressure for years, Police Chief
Bill Kolender said after talking to Mrs. Pendleton, whom he
described as ``distraught, upset, obviously.''
   Pendleton was alone at the Hilton Beach and Tennis Resort, riding
a stationary cycle when he collapsed about 10 a.m., said Gary
Lingley, director of the hotel's tennis club. Pendleton, a San Diego
resident, was a member of the health club, Lingley said.
   ``Two members heard a small noise, a scream maybe, we don't know
what it was,'' Lingley said. ``About a minute later, when they
walked into the health club they saw him lying face down by the
Exercycles. He had fallen unconscious.''
   Lingley said the club members called for help and he arrived at
the scene in about 15 seconds and began giving Pendleton
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A doctor who was a hotel guest
assisted until the paramedics arrived, he said.
   An avid jogger and swimmer, he once taught physical education at
the college level and worked as a government recreation director in
Washington and Baltimore being named director of the Model Cities
Department in San Diego in 1972. He was president of the Urban
League in San Diego from 1975 until 1982.
   Pendleton graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C.,
in 1954 and after serving in the Army he returned to earn a masters'
degree in education.
   Pendleton was married Oct. 10, 1970 to Margrit Krause, according
to the Federal Staff Directory. Their three children were listed as
George Wallace, Susan Adele and Paula Denise.

<HEAD>U.S. to Pay Over $1 Billion in Savings Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board will pay more
than $1 billion in insurance to depositors when it liquidates one or
more savings institutions in what will be the largest such payout
ever, according to a published report.
   The bank board's chairman, Danny Wall, declined on Sunday to name
the savings and loan institutions that are to be liquidated, The New
York Times reported in Monday's editions.
   He said the details of the action would be announced Monday in
Washington.
   But savings industry officials told the Times they expected the
liquidations to be in California.
   The Orange County Register, a Southern California newspaper,
reported Sunday that federal regulators would be ``quickly arranging
a cure'' for the American Diversified Savings Bank and the North
American Savings and Loan, two troubled institutions in Costa Mesa,
Calif.
   Wall and other bank board officials declined to comment on that
report, according to the Times.
   ``The liquidation will be the largest payout of this type,'' Wall
said. Liquidation was a last resort, he added, taken only after such
measures as a merger with a healthier institution could not be
achieved.
   A spokesman for the bank board, Karl T. Hoyle, said the
institutions to be liquidated had ``very high-yielding accounts.''
American Diversified and North American Savings are known to offer
among the highest interest rates in the region.
   The bank board oversees 3,200 savings institutions. Last month,
the General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of Congress,
estimated that more than 500 were insolvent, and more than 200
``hopelessly insolvent.''
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which provides
insurance for depositors in savings institutions, does not have
sufficient funds to cover deposits in all those institutions.
   Last year Congress authorized the board to raise up to $10.8
billion by selling bonds over the next three years to assist
insolvent savings and loan institutions.

   Actress Betty White, who stars in
NBC-TV's series ``The Golden Girls,'' was honored with the Roar
Foundation's Golden Lion Award for her dedication to animal rights.
   The award, the first to be given, was presented Sunday by actress
Tippi Hedren in a ceremony in a Beverly Hills theater, said
publicist Robyn Wilson.
   Miss White, who is on the foundation's board, was chosen because
of her ``exemplary dedication to the cause of animal protection and
animal rights,'' Ms. Wilson said.
   The foundation raises money for the Shambala Preserve in Acton,
30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. The preserve is home to more
than 100 lions, tigers, mountain lions, and other large cats as well
as two elephants, which are allowed to roam.
   The habitat was purchased by Miss Hedren, who starred in Alfred
Hitchcock's movie ``The Birds.''

   Australian conductor Richard Bonynge has found the
missing second act of an opera by Italian composer Gaetano
Donizetti, four years after an American musicologist discovered its
first and third acts.
   The lost portion of the three-act ``Elisabeth'' was discovered
last week in the cellar of the Royal Opera House, where musicologist
Will Crutchfield found the other acts, the Sunday Times reported.
   Bonynge currently is leading his wife, Dame Joan Sutherland, in a
production of Donizetti's ``Anna Bolena'' at the Royal Opera House
at Covent Garden.
   The Times quoted him as saying he made the discovery ``absolutely
by chance, in an old stack of ballet rubbish (music).''
   Donizetti, who lived from 1797 to 1848, composed the work in
1838. The opera, set in Russia, tells the story of a young woman's
walk from Siberia to Moscow to try to win her father's freedom from
exile.
   ``We are now looking for the first possible opportunity to bring
this opera before the public _ it will probably be within 18 months
and initially in a concert version,'' said Paul Findlay, the
director of Covent Garden.

   Merv Griffin and Eva Gabor will
soon marry, Eva's sister Zsa Zsa says.
   But Griffin's publicist, Warren Cowan, said Sunday night that he
could not confirm any wedding plans, and added, ``I'd be very
surprised.''
   Griffin, a former talk show host who parlayed his production
company profits into a real estate empire, refuses to discuss his
private life, Cowan said.
   ``Eva is going to marry Merv Griffin,'' Zsa Zsa gushed Saturday
night during a reception. ``They are just coming back from the
Bahamas. I'm not supposed to tell, but I just can't shut up.''
   Zsa Zsa revealed her younger sister's nuptial plans after South
Pasadena Mayor Jim Woolacott mistakenly called her ``Princess Eva''
during a centennial celebration.
   Zsa Zsa also offered a series of observations on her sibling.
   ``She's one year younger than me, but she's 10 years older,'' Zsa
Zsa said. ``She's the one who was on `Green Acres.' You know, the
little innocent one, but she's not that innocent.''

<HEAD>Summit and Internal Politics Give Soviets a Week to Remember</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first visit to Moscow by a U.S. president in 14
years was overshadowed in the state-run media by a spirited
discussion of domestic politics, a debate that brought unprecedented
developments and raised issues not heard since the 1920s.
   The argument is over a nationwide Communist Party conference
starting June 28 that is shaping up as a battleground for supporters
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and the mid-level managers who
oppose them.
   Entrenched bureaucrats fear the Soviet leader's campaign to end
party oversight of the day-to-day details of governing and economic
planning and give the people a greater role, sociologist Tatyana
Zaslavskaya said in an interview printed Saturday by the newspaper
Izvestia.
   A senior Western diplomat said ``they have not debated issues as
basic as this since the 1920s,'' when the tyranny of Josef Stalin
began.
   Last week, Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater
openness, was giving both the Soviet people and the West an
unprecedented look at the internal Soviet debate.
   In a week of firsts:
   _ On Saturday, May 28, Soviet television carried what is believed
to be the first live broadcast of the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, the nation's parliament, formally ratifying the treaty to
scrap intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which had been signed at
the December summit.
   _ President Reagan arrived the next day, becoming the first U.S.
president since Gerald Ford to visit the Soviet Union.
   _ Ousted Politburo member Boris N. Yeltsin, in unprecedented
interviews last Monday with U.S. and British broadcasters, attacked
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev as the ``main person
responsible'' for slowing down the reforms.
   That was only the beginning.
   The Moscow News reported that same day that vandals had smashed a
Jewish cemetery west of the capital and Jewish residents said they
feared rising anti-Semitism, an unwelcome by-product of greater
openness.
   Throughout the week, reform advocates held news conferences for
Western journalists covering the summit, disclosing a fight over
delegate selection to the party conference.
   Reformers said they had been nominated by grass-roots party
organizations but were vetoed at next level, giving the Western
press an unprecedented look inside Soviet politics.
   On Tuesday, Reagan was asked whether he still thought the Soviet
Union was an evil empire, and responded: ``I was talking about
another time, another era.''
   Wednesday, Gorbachev became the first Soviet Communist Party
leader to give a news conference on Soviet soil. He used the
occasion to refute Yeltsin.
   Later Wednesday, several dozen members of a fledgling independent
political group, the Democratic Union, held a demonstration in
downtown Moscow to demand a multi-party system. One group member
said he thought it was ``the first time there was a political
meeting without repression ...'' since shortly after the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
   On Thursday, Reagan departed expressing deep personal regard and
political faith in Gorbachev.
   Friday morning, Ms. Zaslavskaya, a leading reformer, told Western
reporters ``the most pronounced advocates of perestroika were not
selected'' to the party conference. Perestroika is Gorbachev's
`restructuring' of Soviet life.
   At midday, Andrei D. Sakharov gave a news conference at the
Foreign Ministry press center, his first ever under government
auspices. Sakharov led the dissident movement in the Soviet Union
until he was banished to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980.
Gorbachev telephoned him in December 1986 to invite him back to
Moscow.
   On Friday afternoon, Gorbachev waded into the fight over
conference delegates, attending a meeting of the Moscow party
executive bureau that restored the names of some, but not all, of
the most outspoken reformers.
   On Saturday, party newspapers published a fairly detailed account
of the party meeting, along with a list of the 319 delegates chosen
from the city of Moscow. Ms. Zaslavskaya was not listed, but many of
her allies were.
   Later Saturday, Ligachev gave a speech dispelling reports of
splits in the party, proclaiming that ``all the members of the
leadership are deeply committed to the cause of perestroika.''
   ``Adversaries in the West, and some people in our country, too,
are making allegations about differences among the Soviet
leadership, in the Politburo ... Trying to drive a wedge in the
leadership is a notorious trick.''
   Also Saturday, Izvestia published a long interview with Ms.
Zaslavskaya in which she said the party conference _ the first since
1941 _ should find ways to make ``sharp cuts in the party
apparatus.''
   If the pace of change continues, the next U.S. president to visit
Moscow will find one quite different from the one Reagan left behind.

<HEAD>As Soviets Leave, A New War For The Afghans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Soviet troops proceed with their
withdrawal from Afghanistan, the war between government forces and
anti-communist guerrillas is entering a new stage.
   The ultimate test will be whether either side can muster enough
cohesion, military might and popular acceptance to impose its will
on a nation that throughout history has resisted control by any
central authority.
   The U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas have proved themselves adept
at defending their home turf in the countryside, but in a decade of
fighting they have yet to capture a major city.
   Almost every night, one or more guerrilla rockets land in or near
Kabul, but these attacks seem to constitute little more than
harassment _ not a battle for the capital, which is still defended
by Soviet soldiers.
   A Western diplomat said last week that he believes the guerrillas
could eventually triumph over the Soviet-style government, but only
if they change their methods.
   ``The only way you can unseat this Soviet client is through fifth
column tactics, psychological warfare,'' said the diplomat, who is
not American but declined to be identified further.
   ``Millions are being spent on the mujahedeen (guerrillas), but
they're still walking around barefoot and in sneakers,'' he said.
   A clandestine radio station, waging a battle for hearts and
minds, would help, he said.
   ``You could have four radio transmitters for the price of one
Stinger'' _ the U.S.-made anti-aircraft missiles the mujahedeen, or
holy warriors, have used to shoot down Soviet and Afghan aircraft.
   But there is no evidence of such a shift in tactics. Instead, the
guerrillas are pointing to their military triumphs.
   Another Western diplomat said they have seized control of 19
district towns since late April, when the Soviets began preparing
for the withdrawal of roughly 100,000 Red Army troops that began May
15 and is to end by Feb. 15.
   District towns are considered important because they are
administrative and military centers. All those taken by the
guerrillas were defended by Afghan soldiers, not the Soviets, whose
troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Most of the seized district towns are near the border with
Pakistan, where the guerrillas are based and get weapons provided by
the United States, China and other countries.
   Although diplomats and other observers believe some of the
captures of district towns were genuine military victories, others
came about through tactical withdrawals.
   President Najib has portrayed these retreats by his soldiers as
part of a deliberate plan to enable more than 3 million refugees to
return home from Pakistan through a ``demilitarized zone.'' This may
be a face-saving device for the government, but also could be a
calculated gamble.
   If large numbers of Afghan women and children start crossing the
border, husbands and fathers who are now guerrillas will have to
make a choice: to carry their battle against the government into
territory farther from home or to join their families, rebuild their
lives and start tilling the soil again.
   ``Who's to say the mujahedeen won't think of better things to do
than to fight for Kabul?'' A foreign diplomat asked, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Very, very few of them have fought outside
their home areas.''
   The morale and loyalty of the Afghan army, whose strength is
estimated at between 40,000 and 60,000 men and consists largely of
conscripts, has long been suspect.
   But the government has other forces who are well-armed and better
motivated. These include an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 ``sarandoy,''
paramilitary troops with a decade of demonstrated loyalty to the
regime, and KHAD, the secret police force that has its own tanks and
armor and is conservatively estimated at 10,000 men.
   In the long run, the most important force may be the village
militias, who are currently on the government payroll.
   Foreign diplomats estimate their strength at 65,000, the bulk of
them in towns and villages around Kabul.
   In Chahal Dokhtran, a village 20 miles south of Kabul that is
frequently on the government's tours for foreign journalists,
militia commander Bari Mangal said he had 61 men to defend the 400
residents.
   The militiamen ranged in age from early teens to late 70s and
carried World War I vintage rifles, semi-automatic Kalashnikovs and
Thompson submachine guns.
   Their politics, as translated by government officials, were
firmly pro-government and staunchly anti-mujahedeen. But their main
interest seemed to be keeping outsiders away from their fields and
fortress-like mud brick houses.

   Angry relatives of a robbery suspect police had
shot and killed ransacked the police headquarters in a southern
town, an official newspaper reported today.
   The rioters stormed the building before dawn May 21 in Jiaxi
Township, Guangdong province, breaking desks, a television set and
burning or smashing eight police motorcycles, the China Daily said.
   For more than an hour before dispersing, the intruders chased
police, stole 200 bullets, burned police uniforms and seized
documents and bicycles, the report said.
   It did not say how many villagers took part in the attack, but
said it was led by the father and brothers of Li Huaihe, the
shooting victim.
   Li was shot by police earlier that night while resisting arrest
after committing a robbery, the daily reported.
   It said the rioters caused about $51,000 in damage.

   A set of figures compiled by the Central
Intelligence Agency illustrates how brilliantly the economy of Japan
has performed in the 1980s compared with those of the United States
and western Europe.
   In dealing with unemployment, inflation, production and foreign
trade, Japan outshines the others, even successful West Germany. The
yen's value has zoomed up at the same time that Japanese interest
rates have floated gently down.
   The CIA makes no comment on its information. Its directorate of
intelligence issues a thin pamphlet every two weeks called
``Economics and Energy Indicators.'' It contains only bland-looking
tables of figures and no analysis, but the latest issue summarizes
figures in the 1980s.
   ``Japanese success goes back to the end of World War II and it's
due to a combination of things,'' commented Jeffrey J. Schott of the
private Institute for International Economics.
   ``There's readiness to adjust to changing circumstances _ they're
shifting now from exports to production for home use. There's
cooperative labor and management practices. And there's just hard
work. They're all interrelated.''
   Japanese unemployment was a little above 2 percent at the start
of the decade. It has crept up a bit but never reached 3 percent.
   In this country unemployment was 9.6 percent in 1982, three times
Japan's. It was even higher for a while during that year's
recession, but has fallen since then.
   Still, the U.S. rate as given by the CIA _ 5.6 percent in
February _ is still more than twice as high as Japan's 2.7 percent.
   Unemployment in the four biggest countries of western Europe
varied widely, from West Germany's 7.7 percent in 1982 to Italy's
12.4 percent last year.
   CIA figures do not always agree with those issued by other U.S.
government agencies, and CIA officials say they come from several
sources. The Labor Department reported that U.S. consumer prices
rose 4.4 percent in 1987. The CIA put the number at 3.7 percent.
There are often many ways to calculate such statistics.
   On inflation, the CIA showed consumer prices in the United States
rising by 6.2 percent in 1982. Although the increase was only 3.7
percent last year, it is climbing again, according to the agency.
   Western Europe's record is similar, on average, although it
differs widely from country to country. Earlier in the decade these
rates averaged somewhat higher in Europe than in the United States.
By 1987 the average was nearly the same.
   But in Japan the inflation rate never reached 3 percent. Last
year Japanese consumers paid an average of only one-tenth of 1
percent over the level of 1986. In 1988 prices are falling fairly
sharply, with the drop in February at an annual rate of 2.4 percent.
   In 1982, the United States bought foreign goods worth $32 billion
more than what it could sell abroad. Though for a while that year
its trade was almost in balance, imports rose so fast in the rest of
the 1980s that in 1987 the U.S. international trade deficit amounted
to a record $153 billion.
   Japan started with a trade surplus of $19 billion in 1982 and
rocketed to a record of $96 billion in 1987. The level drooped a
little early last year, but rose again through February.
   ``The Japanese performance wouldn't look so brilliant if our own
had not been so un-brilliant,'' said Robert Solomon of the Brookings
Institution, a major Washington research group.
   ``Japan's big growth was based on exports. How big would it have
been except for the U.S. budget deficit?''
   Western Europe had a small but rising trade surplus since 1985
due largely to West Germany's record export sales. Britain, France
and Italy all had deficits in their world trade last year, as they
have steadily throughout the decade.

   A police officer was slain Sunday night
during a shootout at a motel with a man who also was shot to death,
authorities said.
   Officer Brian Tunnell was pronounced dead at St. Francis Hospital
in Tulsa, with a gunshot wound to the head, police said in a
statement.
   The suspect, whose name was not released pending notification of
family, was killed when the officer with whom he was scuffling
grabbed Tunnell's gun and shot the suspect.
   Lt. Gary Anderson tried to arrest the suspect at the Elms Motel
on a felony warrant from Liberty County, Texas. The suspect struck
Anderson with an iron gate during the scuffle, police said.
   Tunnell arrived after Anderson told the motel manager to call for
help, and the suspect pulled Anderson's service revolver from him
and shot Tunnell in the head, according to the police statement.
   The motel manager then fired five shots at the suspect to
distract him, and Anderson was able to take Tunnell's gun, shooting
the suspect once, police said.
   ``It's been a real long night,'' said the wife of the motel
manager who spoke on condition of that her name not be used. ``We're
going to be so notorious. We're just a little motel in Miami,
Oklahoma.''
   The woman, who owns the 14-unit motel with her husband, said
Miami police told her not to release any information on the
shootings.
   Police Chief Bill Melton was unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>Smith & Wesson, Beretta To Battle Again For Military Handgun
Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smith & Wesson, the American gun manufacturer
that three years ago lost a battle to produce the military's primary
handgun, is again trying to win the Army's business in a new
contract competition ordered by Congress.
   Beretta, an Italian company that produces its M-9 pistol in
Maryland, won out over the Massachusetts-based Smith & Wesson in the
1985 competition.
   Manufacturers of 9mm automatic pistols including Smith & Wesson,
Beretta and Sturm, Ruger & Co. of Connecticut have been invited by
the Army to submit 30 sample guns each by Aug. 17.
   The contract for 146,000 guns, with an estimated value of more
than $30 million, is expected to be awarded next year.
   Of potentially equal significance to the companies is that many
civilian and police purchasers tend to follow the Army's lead,
analysts say.
   Before the Army contract, the only Americans familiar with
Beretta were ``readers of James Bond,'' said Robert I. Hass, a
senior vice president at Smith & Wesson. ``It put Beretta on the
map,'' he said.
   Beretta won the $75 million 1985 contract to produce 316,000 9mm
guns to replace the Colt .45, the standard U.S. military sidearm
since 1911.
   The Army had no intention of holding a new contract competition
for the next order. But following the 1986 death of Rep. Joseph
Addabbo, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee and leading Beretta supporter, Massachusetts Reps.
Edward Boland and Silvio Conte pushed through a measure ordering the
new competition.
   Boland is the No. 2 Democrat and Conte is the top Republican on
the Appropriations Committee.
   Under the congressional mandate, the Army asked companies to
submit test samples last year but exempted Beretta, saying the M-9
was tested regularly by the Army. Maj. Phil Soucy said in December
that requiring Beretta tests would be a ``stupid'' waste of taxpayer
money.
   Smith & Wesson cried foul, claiming the Army's new 9mm order was
substantially different from the guns now being produced by Beretta
and therefore the Italian company should be required to submit test
models.
   When the Army did not change its position, Smith & Wesson refused
to enter the competition and appealed to the General Accounting
Office's comptroller general. The congressional agency ruled in
February and again in April that the Army should retest Beretta if
it wants to retest the Smith & Wesson weapon.
   Army officials sent out a notice last month that a new
competition would be held and all companies _ including Beretta _
would be subject to testing. Smith & Wesson officials now say they
will compete.

<HEAD>Report: Wright Aide Says He Spent 200 Office Hours On Speaker's
Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former aide to House Speaker Jim Wright says
in an interview published today that he spent about 200 hours of
congressional office time working on Wright's book ``Reflections of
a Public Man.''
   The book, and Wright's royalties from it, have sparked calls for
an ethics committee investigation of the House speaker.
   Former Wright aide Matthew Cossolotto, who worked for the Texas
Democrat from 1983 until early this year, told The Washington Post
he spent about 200 hours working on the book project during office
hours.
   He said he also flew to Fort Worth, Texas, and spent almost three
weeks doing final editing on the book with Wright's publishers.
   Cossolotto said that at the time he was working on the book, he
received no other compensation besides his congressional salary of
about $27,000.
   Cossolotto said he became ``a little uncomfortable'' as the
project went along, but he was not ``clearly aware'' of House rules
that say congressional compensation is only for official duties.
   Wright told the newspaper that Cossolotto's work on the book was
proper, and that the amount of time the aide spent on the project
was ``rather negligible.''
   ``If he gave some time to try to help put together a book that
would demonstrate to the public my philosophy, my basic beliefs,
that wouldn't be too far afield from the public business,'' he said.
   A complaint filed with the House ethics committee by Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., cited newspaper reports that Wright received
unusually high royalties for the book, which was published by a
Texas associate who also received nearly $300,000 in business from
Wright's campaign.
   The book is a compilation of Wright's speeches and anecdotes. It
was published by Carlos Moore, who was paid more than $250,000 by
the congressman's campaign committee during the same 1985-86 period
in which Wright was earning royalties on the book.
   Gingrich's complaint, supported by 73 other House Republicans,
also cited actions by Wright on behalf of Texas oilmen with whom he
had a financial relationship.
   Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog group, also has called for
an ethics investigation, and Vice President George Bush has called
for a special prosecutor to investigate Wright's dealings.
   The ethics committee began deliberations Thursday on whether to
investigate Gingrich's allegations and is to continue its
discussions this week.

   Kitty Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential
front-runner Michael Dukakis, was recuperating at Massachusetts
General Hospital today from spinal surgery she underwent last week.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 51, is ``doing splendidly on all fronts,'' Dr.
Nicholas T. Zervas, chief of neurology at the hospital, said Sunday.
``She's in splendid spirits.''
   Mrs. Dukakis had surgery Friday to remove two herniated discs in
her neck that were pressing dangerously on her spinal cord.
   Dukakis visited his wife at her hospital room on Sunday, and the
two strolled in the hospital corridor, hospital spokesman Martin
Bander said.
   After the visit, Dukakis returned to campaigning. He had stops in
New Jersey and then was flying to California. The two states hold
the final races of the Democratic primary season on Tuesday.
   The Massachusetts governor told reporters Sunday his wife had
some pain in her hip, where doctors removed bone for grafting, and
was walking with the support of a walker.
   Doctors have said Mrs. Dukakis probably would be hospitalized for
up to two weeks.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Dukakis was receiving messages from well-wishers
who included some of her husband's former rivals for the Democratic
nomination.
   Mrs. Dukakis received a potted plant from Jesse Jackson. Jackson
remains an active Democratic candidate.

   The Secret Service was trying to determine
whether a man who tried to carry a knife into a mosque knew Jesse
Jackson was due to appear at the site a short time later.
   The man, whose name has not been released, was arrested Saturday
evening when he refused to leave the weapon at the door of the
Islamic Center of Southern California. He was held on outstanding
traffic warrants, said Secret Service spokesman Richard Adams.
   ``He was advised not to enter with a knife. He said that he was
going to go in with the knife'' and then was detained by center
security guards, Adams said Sunday.
   A spokesman for the center, Dr. Maher Hathout, said the man
appeared at the center wearing a dagger in a sheath around his waist
and was refused entry. He said he did not know if any threat was
made against Jackson, who was not present at the time.
   Jackson spoke about an hour after the arrest, without incident.
   ``Right now, there's a question of whether he (the detained man)
even knew Jackson was going to be there,'' said Jane Vezeris, a
Secret Service spokeswoman in Washington.
   The Secret Service planned to discuss any possible charges
against the man Monday with the U.S. Attorney's office, Adams said.

   There are so many old bombs around that the British
army has set up a new regiment to deal with them _ anywhere it's
asked.
   The army says the new bomb disposal unit will be available to
help clear explosive devices in Britain and other countries.
   The Royal Engineers unit, named 101 Engineer Regiment, started
its formal life on Sunday with a parade at Rochester Castle in Kent,
near its base.
   The army believes there is sufficient work, most of it dating
from World War II, to keep the unit busy well into the next century.
   Bombs rained down on Britain in the war and sometimes buried
themselves without going off. Every month or so, one is revealed by
excavation and the army has to defuse it and then take it away and
explode it harmlessly.

   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail:
   
   JESSE JACKSON, speaking Sunday on what role he expects at the
Democratic convention: ``What does Jesse Jackson want? Empowerment
for all people in America ... We will fight to insure that the
Democratic Party is the party of the people, that party of
empowerment, the party of participation, the party of hope.''
   
   WILLIE BROWN, Jackson's campaign chairman, insisting Jackson
should get more than just consideration for the vice presidential
spot on the Democratic ticket: ``I think consideration means
literally extending the opportunity to go on the ticket, and then it
will be up to Mr. Jackson to determine whether or not he wishes to
accept it.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, responding to Jackson's continued insistence
that he will fight hard for issues on the Democratic Party platform:
``I don't see any deep divisions in the party at all.''

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega says the key to
success of this week's peace talks with Nicaraguan rebels lies with
the Reagan administration.
   ``We hold the United States government responsible for what
happens in these meetings'' with the Contras, the president said
Sunday after meeting with labor leaders who support his leftist
Sandinista government.
   Government officials and leaders of the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan
Resistance, the Contra umbrella organization, are scheduled to meet
Tuesday through Thursday in Managua to attempt to forge a lasting
peace.
   It would mark the fourth occasion the combatants in the
7-year-old civil war have met in the Nicaraguan capital to discuss a
definitive truce.
   The Contra delegation planned to travel today to San Jose, Costa
Rica, to prepare for the talks, said a rebel spokesman in a
telephone interview from Miami on Sunday. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Ortega said the Reagan administration would be to blame if the
Contras did not agree to end the war and ``lay down their arms.''
   In the event the talks fell through, he added, ``we will be
obliged to confront this terrorist policy with all the firmness and
force with which we have confronted it for all of these years.''
   The rebels, trained, funded and supplied by the United States,
began their war to overthrow the Sandinistas in 1981.
   Ortega said his government would offer ``no variations'' to its
peace proposal submitted during the last round of negotiations held
May 26-28.
   During that session, the government agreed to discuss Contra
demands for political changes they say would bring about
``democratization'' in Nicaragua. Those include freedom of the
press, an end to the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front's
control over the armed forces and the government and electoral and
judicial reforms.
   The Contras rejected a government proposal for a 30-day extension
of the two-month truce that began April 1 and a plan for delivering
humanitarian aid to rebel units gathered inside truce zones.
   The cease-fire was set to lapse on May 31, but both sides agreed
to extend it at least until the end of this week's talks. Ortega has
already announced a unilateral 30-day truce extension.
   The rebel delegation was permitted to visit leaders of the
domestic opposition and Roman Catholic Church officials during the
last round of talks. Ortega said Sunday that they would be allowed
to do so again this week.

   Share prices climbed across the board, driving the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's main barometer to a record closing high
Monday, while the dollar declined slightly against the Japanese yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues rose by 89.76 points, or 0.32 percent, from its
previous high of 27,906.48 points last Saturday to reach a record
27,996.24 points.
   In foreign exchange dealings, the dollar closed at 126.07 yen,
down 0.04 yen from last Friday's close. It opened at 126.32 yen and
was traded in range between 126.00 yen and 126.38 yen.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said
trading was active. He said the dollar's strength against the yen
followed its recent rallies against the West German mark, Swiss
franc and British pound.
   ``Investor confidence in higher (stock) prices was further
boosted following last Friday's report on the U.S. monthly
unemployment rate,'' which helped ease concern over inflation in the
United States, said Katsuhiro Yagawara of Daiwa Securities.
   The U.S. government reported the nation's unemployment rate in
May rose to 5.6 percent of the labor force from 5.4 percent the
previous month, helping the U.S. bond market to rally last Friday.

<HEAD>Dukakis Asks Tuesday's Voters to Put Him Over the Top</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis made final appeals to California voters today, saying ``We
may be able to lock up this nomination early and go to Atlanta
united.''
   Dukakis was flying around the state today with stops in San
Diego, San Jose and Los Angeles, a trip aimed at gaining exposure in
each of the state's major television markets on the eve of Tuesday's
primary season finale.
   The Massachusetts governor returned to the state Sunday evening,
where he had a rally at a Greek Orthodox church, after completing
two days of campaigning in New Jersey, another of the four states
holding primaries on the final day of delegate-selection contests.
   Greeted warmly at the church, Dukakis danced a traditional Greek
dance and told supporters, ``With your help and the help of people
all across the country we're going to win a decisive victory here in
California, in New Jersey and Montana and New Mexico.''
   With a seemingly insurmountable lead over Jesse Jackson in the
delegate count, Dukakis aides were confident he will gain the
remaining delegates to assure his nomination by Tuesday's primaries
and the campaign can turn its attention to the important selection
of a running mate.
   Aboard his campaign plane on the flight west, Dukakis said he
would turn his focus to choosing a vice presidential candidate after
Tuesday. He said the search would be led by the top officials of his
campaign.
   Dukakis said his priority will be choosing someone who would be
qualified to be president if needed, and that only after that
qualification is met would he look at political considerations such
as the person's geographic region, expertise and other
considerations.
   Dukakis has more than 1,800 delegates toward the 2,081 needed for
a delegate majority at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   With Jackson his only remaining rival and a Dukakis nomination
assumed, voter turnout remains his big concern, and Dukakis urged
voters at a series of stops in New Jersey not to forget to vote.
   ``Tuesday is very important, and please don't let anybody think
this is over,'' Dukakis said.
   He added that with wins in the two big states voting Tuesday, and
the smaller states of Montana and New Mexico, ``We may be able to
lock up this nomination early and go to Atlanta united.''
   Confident, the Dukakis campaign has aired no television ads in
New Jersey, and few in California.
   Already the Dukakis campaign is working on its fall campaign
against Republican George Bush, and Dukakis touched on themes aimed
at suburban swing voters, many of whom have gone with President
Reagan and the Republicans in the last two elections. In New Jersey,
he emphasized family values and economic policies that recognize the
changing needs of families with two working spouses and children who
need day care.
   In Paterson, an older industrial city, Dukakis called for federal
and state investment in urban revitalization, citing the example of
the economic rebirth of Lowell, Mass., in his state. Dukakis did
not, however, shed further light on how this investment would be
paid for, beyond his previous calls for providing modest sums of
money to encourage private development projects.
   In Jersey City, across the river from New York City, Dukakis
stressed the themes of affordable housing and blasted the Reagan
administration for what he said was a 90 percent cutback in federal
support for public housing assistance to low- and moderate-income
families. He said it's ``no wonder'' the nation faces a problem of
homelessness.
   Dukakis responded to indications from Jackson that he intends to
continue campaigning up to the convention, pressing his issues.
Dukakis said he saw no harm _ but added that he expects Jackson to
work for the ticket in the fall.
   ``It's not harmful at all,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
``He's a very strong person who's done an extraordinary job of
winning votes and winning support.
   ``I hope and believe we're going to have a good relationship. We
have in the past,'' he said. ``I suspect he's going to be out there
campaigning hard for the Democratic ticket this fall.''

   Quarantine AIDS victims? Close a
nuclear plant? Create a new county? Limit campaign spending?
   These are some of the questions to be decided Tuesday by voters
in California, where controversial ballot issues have long been a
part of the political landscape.
   This year's primary ballot offers two competing options for
capping campaign spending and two others for modifying the spending
limit on state and local government, imposed by a 1979 initiative
sponsored by political activist Paul Gann.
   The statewide ballot also carries a proposition that would
stiffen penalties for second-degree murder when the victim is a
police officer.
   State bond measures would provide $3.2 billion for
transportation, schools, home loans for veterans, earthquake-safe
buildings and park land purchases.
   The $776 million general-obligation bond issue for the purchase
and development of parks and lands that support endangered species
is the first bond measure placed on California's ballot through the
initiative, or signature-gathering process, in modern times.
   Proponents adopted the strategy after state lawmakers defeated
three park bond proposals in 1986.
   Also among the bond proposals is Gov. George Deukmejian's $1
billion measure for highway construction and improvement. Although
it was placed on the ballot by the Legislature, it is opposed by
several lawmakers.
   Local ballots carry two hotly debated county measures.
   In Sacramento, voters could become the first in the nation to
close a nuclear power plant when they consider two measures on the
fate of troubled Rancho Seco, 25 miles southeast of the capital.
   Voter-sponsored Measure B would order the plant's immediate and
permanent closure. The rival Measure C, sponsored by the municipal
utility that operates Rancho Seco, asks voters to allow the plant to
operate on a trial basis for at least 18 months, as long as utility
directors approve its performance.
   In San Bernardino, the nation's largest county, voters will
decide whether to carve away a portion and create a new Mojave
County. Proponents of the new county, which would be mostly desert,
say four-fifths of the 1.1 million residents are jammed into the far
eastern edge of San Bernardino County and have different concerns
than those who want to secede.
   California also has a U.S. Senate primary, as do New Mexico, New
Jersey and Montana. In addition, Montana has a primary in both
parties for governor.
   The most emotionally charged of California's ballot measures,
Proposition 69, is virtually identical to a 1986 anti-AIDS ballot
measure that voters defeated by a margin of more than 2-to-1.
   Proposition 69, backed by supporters of extremist Lyndon
LaRouche, would require health officials to report to the state
health department the names of people with AIDS and those testing
positive for the virus.
   It would add acquired immune deficiency syndrome to the state's
list of communicable diseases, making both groups subject to
possible quarantine.
   Proponents say the measure is needed to control the deadly
disease, but opponents have harshly criticized it.
   ``The intent of Proposition 69 is not to help people help
themselves, but rather to identify and separate people from their
support networks,'' says Ron Braithwaite, president of the Alice B.
Toklas Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club in San Francisco.
   Also heavily contested on the statewide ballot are Propositions
68 and 73, aimed at controlling rising expenditures by political
candidates.
   Supporters of both say incumbents and challengers depend on large
contributions from special interests, who then have influence over
the candidates who are elected.
   Proposition 68, supported by public-interest groups, would
authorize partial public financing for legislative candidates who
abide by limits on donations and campaign spending.
   The competing measure, Proposition 73, which is supported by
state lawmakers, would impose limits on contributions and impose a
ban on any public financing for candidates.
   Supporters of two other conflicting initiatives, Propositions 71
and 72, which would alter the Gann government spending limit, agree
on little except that the limit needs modification to some degree.
   The spending ceiling, approved by voters nine years ago in a
Gann-sponsored initiative that followed the historic tax-cutting
Proposition 13, ties annual expenditures to population growth and
cost of living.
   It allows state and local government spending to increase no more
than the lower of either the U.S. Consumer Price Index or California
per-capita personal income.

<HEAD>Paul Newman Reflects On New Camp For Ill Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ASHFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Newman looked back over his years as
an Academy Award-winning actor, race car driver and family man, and
said his new camp for seriously ill children may be the most
important accomplishment of his life.
   ``It's certainly a contender,'' Newman said in an interview
Saturday. ``It may ultimately turn out to be the champ. It depends
on how it goes.''
   The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a $17 million project that
includes the camp and an endowment, was started by Newman in 1986
and is scheduled to open this month for children with
life-threatening diseases.
   Newman's food company, Newman's Own Inc., donated $7 million to
the camp. He raised another $7 million from donations. A.E.
Hotchner, Newman's business partner and friend, said $3 million more
is needed to complete the camp's endowment.
   ``The thing I wanted to do was to endow it, not just build it,''
Newman said. ``Five years from now I don't want it turned into a
retirement place for executives.''
   The camp, which is free for children ages 7 to 17, is on about
300 acres of land straddling Ashford and Eastford and is modeled
after a frontier logging town of the old Wild West.
   There is horseback riding, boating, a baseball field, tennis
courts, a gymnasium, dining hall and spacious cabins with sitting
rooms and front porches. Golf carts are available for transportation
around the camp.
   ``This is not a rich man's camp,'' Newman said. ``It's free and
there is still room for more kids.''
   Newman said at a private dedication at the camp that he is
usually cynical about life, but the camp helped him recapture the
enthusiasm of his youth.
   ``I'm pretty cool,'' Newman said. ``I've seen a lot. I've been
through a lot. I lost my cool today. ... I recaptured the enthusiasm
of my youth. This is awesome.''

<TEXT>
   A Yale University alumnus accused of
torching a campus shantytown built to protest apartheid said he'd
once worked in South Africa, according to a man who chased him down.
   ``In my opinion he acknowledged he had done it and he did it
because he had strong feelings on this and felt alumni should have
their say,'' Dr. Michael L. Charney said Sunday. ``He also said he
had given Yale a lot of money.''
   Charney, a Boston psychiatrist and class of 1968, said that while
jogging across the campus Sunday morning he saw a man running away
from the fire.
   ``I yelled `fire' and ran after him,'' Charney said. ``He was in
a tan suit, tie and his class button, which he took off as he ran.''
   Charney said he caught the man, Dr. Elwood D. Bracey, in the
courtyard of one of Yale's residential colleges, where the two had a
political discussion about South Africa, apartheid and Yale's
investment policies.
   Bracey, who apparently was visiting the campus for alumni
weekend, said he'd worked for three months at a South African
hospital and was a Vietnam veteran, Charney said.
   Bracey, of West Palm Beach, Fla., was charged with first-degree
arson in the fire that destroyed the shantytown, named Winnie
Mandela City after the wife of Nelson Mandela, the jailed South
African anti-apartheid leader.
   A story published in today's editions of The Palm Beach Post of
West Palm Beach said Bracey once was sued for allegedly shooting a
neighbor's Doberman pinscher, and kept a pet leopard for 10 years
until it mauled his daughter.
   Bracey, 56, a 1958 Yale graduate, was free on $50,000 bond
pending arraignment today in New Haven Superior Court. He could not
be reached for comment Sunday, despite attempts by telephone to
locate him at hotels.
   Students erected the shanties on a white granite plaza in front
of the Yale administration building in April 1986 to protest
apartheid and Yale investments in South Africa. Officials ordered
police to dismantle the shanties, but allowed them to be rebuilt
after students agreed to maintain them.
   Students occasionally slept in the shanties and Capt. John
Rourke, head of the police-fire investigative unit, speculated that
was why Bracey was charged with first-degree arson.
   Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr., who during a Saturday
meeting with alumni defended the university's decision to allow the
shantytown to remain standing, denounced the arson as a ``lawless
act of violence.''
   ``To destroy them by an act of impulse is the antithesis of
reason and order that is the essence of a university or any
civilized community,'' he said. ``Beyond that, to set the shanties
on fire furtively in the midst of an urban campus is an extremely
dangerous thing to do.''
   All that remained of the shantytown was a pile of charred scrap
lumber and plywood and a wooden shrine draped in the yellow, green
and black of the African National Congress. It was pasted with
sheets of paper listing the names of 250 people killed in the
struggle against apartheid, the system in which South Africa's
whites rule over a land where blacks are the majority.
   Sue Ellen Apte, acting director of the Palm Beach County Medical
Society, described Bracey as a popular doctor.
   ``He's a well-respected physician, not the type of person who
would do something that might have repercussions,'' Apte said.
``He's not hot-tempered.''
   In its report, the Florida newspaper said Bracey kept a pet
leopard named Lepy until 1980 when it mauled his then-2-year-old
daughter, Blythe. After the attack, in which his daughter suffered a
broken arm and scratches on her face and leg, he gave the leopard to
a zoo, the Post said.
   The newspaper also said Bracey became involved in a lawsuit for
shooting to death a neighbor's Doberman in 1982.
   The lawsuit was filed by the neighbor, who was countersued by
Bracey because the dog allegedly intruded onto Bracey's property and
destroyed his nine rabbits and a pet chicken, according to the
newspaper. The two have since settled the dispute, the newspaper
said.

   Inventor Thomas Edison and 11 presidents
were among the 65 people honored this year by the University of Hard
Knocks, which issues diplomas to successful people who never earned
a college degree.
   The mock university _ founded 40 years ago by Jim Comstock,
editor of The West Virginia Hillbilly newspaper _ for the first time
issued posthumous degrees.
   Edison, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were the top
honorees, said Wayne Fugate, a reporter for the Hillbilly and a
former graduate of the University of Hard Knocks.
   Those among the living who were honored came from as far away as
Jakarta to participate in Saturday's ceremony, Fugate said.
   Former Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-W.Va. _ the university's
``mascot'' and a former graduate _ presented diplomas to 45
honorees, including Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor-in-chief of The
Washington Times.
   The commencement was held at Alderson-Broaddus College, but as
Comstock _ a Marshall University graduate _ likes to say of his
college of hard-earned knowledge, ``The world is its campus.''

   Frank Nicholls says there's
something lacking in a pint of beer served in British Columbia bars
_ 4 ounces of beer.
   Nicholls, an electrician, says he's done his homework, sampling
pints in dozens of pubs in the province, and has concluded that most
of them don't give patrons a proper-sized Canadian pint.
   ``I could sue every pub in Vancouver _ right now,'' says
Nicholls, 38.
   Nicholls says most city pubs and clubs sell 16-ounce pints based
on the 128-ounce U.S. gallon. However, the federal Weights and
Measures Act uses the British Imperial gallon, which is 160 ounces.
Under federal law, it is illegal to call anything under 20 ounces a
pint.
   A government official agrees with Nicholls that calling a
16-ounce glass a pint is technically illegal.
   ``That's absolutely right,'' says Archie Patterson, Vancouver
district manager for Weights and Measures. ``The U.S. pint is not
legal.''
   But though most watering holes in the province could be charged
under federal law, Patterson says Ottawa has more important things
to worry about.
   ``We've not really been pushing in that area,'' he said.

<HEAD>Student Who Set Himself Ablaze In Protest Dies, More Street
Demontrations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A radical student leader who set
himself on fire to protest South Korea's relations with the United
States died today of injuries, prompting hundreds of his classmates
to stage another march.
   On Saturday, Park Rae-chun, a 24-year-old junior majoring in
Korean literature, shouted ``Overthrow military fascists,'' doused
his body with flammable liquid and set himself on fire on the roof
of Soongshil University's student center building.
   University officials reported his death today.
   Upon hearing of Park's death, about 1,000 students gathered in
the compound of the Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital and 500 of them
staged a street demonstration shouting ``Yankee go home,'' and
``Punish culprits in the Kwangju Massacre.''
   The alleged massacre refers to the bloody suprresion by
government troops of a 1980 civil uprising in the provincial
capital. At least 191 people were killed by official count.
   Some dissidents accuse President Roh Tae-woo and former President
Chun Doo-hwan, both generals at the time of the incident, of
masterminding the crackdown on the uprising.
   Today, police stood by without interfering as the protesters
marched about a mile to a busy intersection in the southern district
of Yongdungpo and then back to the hospital.
   The students from Soongshil and some other schools surrounded the
hospital and continued to shout anti-American and anti-government
slogans. No violence was immediately reported.
   Officials at Soongshil said funeral arrangements would be made
after consulting with Park's family. They said the school hoped to
bury him in a campus funeral, but that some of his classmates were
planning a ``democratic people's funeral.''
   Park left behind a suicide note that criticized the South Korean
government and the United States, which he blamed for the
partitition of the Korean peninsula.
   He said in the note that he was offering his body to ``the sacred
altar of democracy'' to advance national reunification.
   Ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest used by radical
students to dramatize their cause while trying to shame the
government. Two students killed themselves as part of
anti-government protests last month.

<HEAD>Police Seize Huge Arms Cache, Round Up Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops today raided Indian businesses and
rounded up 40 people, including a former foreign minister, after
police seized a huge shipment of Soviet-made weapons apparently
smuggled from the Middle East.
   Krishna Datt, a Fijian of Indian descent in the ousted government
of Timoci Bavadra, was among those detained because he visited the
Soviet Union in 1985, the Ministry of Information said. It did not
elaborate.
   Government-controlled Radio Fiji said the arms haul included 93
automatic rifles, 10 light machine guns, 300 hand grenades, five
rocket-launchers, 72 bayonets, two large drums of live ammunition
and two pistols.
   It said the weapons were found at several locations near the city
of Nadi, on the western side of the main island of Viti Levu, a
stronghold for the coalition government that was overthrown in a
coup 13 months ago.
   In Suva, soldiers raided at least six buildings housing Indian
businesses, residents said.
   Police spokesman Senior Inspector Romanu Tikotikoca said
authorities had seized a ``substantial portion'' of a shipment of
weapons believed smuggled into the country in April. He gave no
further details.
   The weapons were similar to a shipment seized in Australia a week
ago that arrived from North Yemen and was destined for Fiji.
   Australian customs officers in Sydney, which is 2,000 miles to
the southwest, said the 16-ton shipment could have been used to
start a small war.
   Bavadra has denied any involvement in the gunrunning and his
wife, Kuini, said last week that the incident was part of a
deliberate campaign to discredit her husband, whom she said believes
in non-violence.
   Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka has said the shipments were part of a
foreign plot to destablize the nation, but stopped short of accusing
a particular country or organization.
   Rabuka said he staged the two coups last year to protect the
political rights of ethnic Fijians, who are slightly outnumbered by
the Indian community among the 715,000 residents of this former
British colony.
   Radio Fiji also reported today that the arms and ammunition were
seized in raids on homes and warehouses owned by Indian businessmen.
   Meanwhile, residents said the army had increased its armed
patrols in the capital, with soldiers standing guard at all the
premises raided.
   Earlier, a 47-year-old truck driver of Indian descent was to have
appeared in court charged with conspiring to illegally import the
weapons shipment seized in Australia last week. But police postponed
the court appearance until Tuesday, saying they could not guarantee
the man's safety.
   The suspect was not identified.

<HEAD>Former Judges Say Testimony Insufficient To Convict Waldhem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international panel of former judges has ruled
that testimony given at a televised commission of inquiry would be
too weak to convict Austrian President Kurt Waldheim of Nazi war
crimes.
   After sitting for nine days and hearing 35 witnesses, including
former German soldiers, the judges ruled Sunday night: ``We conclude
unanimously that the evidence which has been put before us is not
enough to make probable that Lt. Waldheim committed any of the war
crimes alleged against him in this inquiry.''
   However, the inquiry did find that Waldheim ``must have
appreciated that many more'' captured Italian officers and hostages
taken in Yugoslavia in 1942 would be shot after he learned that a
large number had been executed.
   ``But he had no authority over them and on his own authority he
could do nothing to stop the shootings,'' the panel said.
   ``Lapses and aberrations of memory such as Dr. Waldheim seems to
have had about his service in Greece and the Balkans are not in
themselves evidence of guilt,'' the judges said.
   Waldheim, 69, who served as an intelligence officer with the
German army in Greece and the Balkans during the war, did not come
to London for the inquiry. It failed to uncover any vital new
witnesses or evidence against him.
   The inquiry was paid for by America's Home Box Office and
Britain's Thames Television.
   Toward the end of the studio filming, prosecuting lawyer Allan A.
Ryan acknowledged he had been unable to produce new evidence. No
investigation so far had concluded that Waldheim was a war criminal,
he said.
   Ryan, a former director of the Nazi-hunting U.S. Office of
Special Investigations, argued however that the totality of evidence
showed ``Waldheim was not there making coffee for these criminals
... his acts facilitated their crimes.''
   Waldheim has vigorously denied the allegations since they
surfaced in 1986, four years after he stepped down as United Nations
secretary-general and 41 years after the end of World War II.
   He was alleged to have been involved in massacres of Yugoslav and
Greek civilians and partisans, deportation of Greek Jews to death
camps and the delivery for execution of captured British commandos
and Greek resistnce fighters.
   He was also accused of involvement in the burning of villages in
Yugoslavia and a notorious massacre there of about 70,000 men, women
and children at Kozara in 1942.
   The judges' decision was delivered by Sir Frederick Lawton at the
end of a 3{-hour TV film of the testimony titled ``Waldheim: A
Commission of Inquiry.''
   ``We have not been asked to decide whether Dr. Waldheim is or is
not guilty of a crime, still less has it been our function to pass a
moral judgement upon him,'' said the 76-year-old former Lord Justice
of Britain's Appeal Court.
   ``A person does not commit a war crime merely because he knows
others have committed such crimes, nor because he worked with or
alongside those who committed them,'' Lawton said.
   His colleagues were Shirley Hufstedler, a former circuit judge
for the U.S. Court of Appeals and ex-education secretary, and West
German Walter Hubner, Swede Gustav Petren and Canadian Gordon Cooper.
   Ryan noted that an inquiry by a commission of historians
concluded last February that Waldheim was not a war criminal.
   ``The World Jewish Congress, for all their outrage, has refrained
very properly from saying that he was. But you have these other
concerns: is he a liar, is he a dishonorable person, is he a shifty
arrogant social climber?'' Ryan asked.
   On Sunday, Waldheim met with King Fahd in Saudi Arabia and
received Saudi Arabia's highest decoration.
   Fahd gave the Austrian president a red carpet welcome when
Waldheim arrived for a three-day state visit on Saturday. The king
later hosted a banquet at which he decorated Waldheim with the
Cordon of King Abdel-Aziz, the nation's highest decoration.

<TEXT>
   FBI agents are checking out tips from
around the country to help determine the identity of a
hearing-impaired boy who has repeatedly sketched images of a plane
crash in his efforts to communicate.
   The boy, believed to be 7 or 8 years old, was found wandering in
Juarez, Mexico, last November. Officials believe the sketches may
mean he was the only member of his family to survive a plane crash.
   No solid leads had developed by late Sunday, although officials
were expecting to receive the fingerprints of a missing Decatur,
Ill., boy today, said Pat Alcala, spokeswoman for the Texas
Department of Human Services in El Paso.
   ``Once the FBI got involved, things started moving faster,'' she
said.
   The boy, called Sabat because he was found on a Saturday _ or
Sabado in Spanish _ bears some resemblance to a boy kidnapped from
Decatur in October 1985, officials said.
   FBI agent Terry Kincaid said calls came in to his office from all
over the country Sunday and agents were checking the tips while
trying to match the boy with descriptions of missing children.
   ``At this time, we're kind of at the mercy of the public to
provide us with some additional leads as to the identity of this
young lad,'' he said.
   The boy is 4 feet 6, has dark blond or light brown hair and a
freckled, white complexion.
   ``In my initial interview with him, we were able to establish
that he was involved in a plane crash and his parents died and his
little sister (died),'' Luis Torre, a DHS caseworker, told NBC
Nightly News in an interview broadcast Sunday. ``It was not much to
go on.''
   U.S. Air Force representatives are reviewing pictures of the
crash drawn by the boy in hopes of recognizing the type of aircraft
and where it may have crashed, Kincaid said.
   Officials have said the boy also could be a child from a military
family who lived in Alaska.
   The boy, who originally was described as deaf-mute, is hearing
impaired and does not talk but can form some one-syllable words.
   He has been in a child protective service center since he was
found on the streets of Juarez, across the border. But investigators
suspect he may be from the United States because he prefers American
food, is familiar with U.S. currency and is a whiz at video games,
which are unknown to many Mexican children.
   In February, child protective services agencies in El Paso and
Juarez signed an agreement to cooperate on missing children cases,
Ms. Alcala said.
   Social workers from Mexico and El Paso have learned the boy comes
from an area where there is knee-deep snow, heavy rainfall,
mountains and trees. His father, who may have been a military man,
was missing four fingers on his right hand and had a mustache.
   The boy's story has received national attention since Thursday
when the DHS released a report on him.
   The Air Force plans to review records of downed planes and look
for any correlations with Sabat's sketches, Kincaid said.
   The boy's pictures of a crashed airplane include the numbers
``28D, 23'' written under the airplane. The boy has pointed to scars
on his left knee, stomach and back, and then pointed to a drawing of
himself walking away from the crash.
   The scars led doctors to believe that if they had been caused by
a crash, it would have been two to three years ago.
   But Kincaid said authorities are not sure the drawings pertain to
the boy. ``We have no idea how much of his sketches are his own idea
or his imagination or maybe re-creations of popular television
shows,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Communist rebels in stolen passenger
jeeps raided a police station today in southeastern Luzon in an
attack that left four people dead and two wounded, the military
reported.
   The raid took place about 7 a.m. in the coastal town of Prieto
Diaz, 250 miles southeast of Manila. A military report said three
guerrillas and a civilian were killed and two of the seven police
defenders were wounded.
   President Corazon Aquino said, meanwhile, that she was
considering a new amnesty for Communist rebels. In a radio interview
Sunday, she said a government panel would meet soon to discuss
extending the amnesty, which expired Feb. 29.
   In a related development, Mrs. Aquino's foreign secretary charged
that unspecified European groups were providing financial support
for the Communist Party of the Philippines.
   About 100 guerrillas of the party's armed wing, the New Peoples
Army, took part in today's attack, which began shortly before a
shift change at the police station, a military report said.
   Defenders fled into foxholes outside the station house and opened
fire on the attackers. They were able to radio for reinforcements
before fleeing the building.
   The rebels fled about an hour later with six firearms and the
station radio, the military said.
   The raid took place a day after rebels killed at least 13
government troops in Negros island in one of the bloodiest ambushes
this year. Eight government militiamen were also missing after the
clash, the military said.
   There was no report of rebel losses.
   Elsewhere, the military said it had suspended combat operations
on southern Luzon island while negotiations are under way for the
release of four young officers kidnapped last Wednesday by the
rebels in Quezon province.
   Col. Ferdinand Lagman said a local congressman, Rep. Oscar
Santos, had made contact with the rebels to bargain for the
officers' freedom.
   They were abducted at gunpoint at a rebel checkpoint by a
guerrilla unit believed responsible for raiding a poultry farm last
week.
   In Manila, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus charged that
unidentified European governments were indirectly financing
communist rebels.
   He made the accusation on the third day of a conference of
representatives from 13 Asian, European and Latin American countries
that have won their freedom from dictators.
   The Philippine military claims the communist-dominated National
Democratic Front, a rebel umbrella organization, received $15
million in aid last year from groups in Europe, the United States,
Japan, Australia and New Zealand.
   Manglapus said foreign aid to the rebels came from
non-governmental organizations but noted that such groups in Europe
are often subsidized by governments.
   He said he has filed formal protests with the European
governments concerned, but did not identify them.

   Two nuns claimed ``a victory for all
women'' after Roman Catholic church officials backed down from their
threat to expel the nuns for publicly supporting the right to
abortions.
   However, the Vatican still could take action against Sisters
Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey, who run a shelter for the
homeless in Charleston, according to Catholics For a Free Choice, a
dissident Catholic group.
   The nuns' order, the General Government Group of the Sisters of
Notre Dame deNamur, said Saturday in a statement from Rome that it
``will not proceed with the process to dismiss'' Ferraro and Hussey.
   ``Dismissal would not be in the best interest of the church or
the religious congregation at this time,'' the order said.
   ``This decision to halt the process of dismissal is not to be
interpreted as support for or agreement with the public statements
which have been made by Sisters Barbara and Patricia,'' according to
the statement read over the telephone to the nuns by officials of
the order in Rome.
   ``The Sisters of Notre Dame disclaim any public statetment on
abortion made by these two sisters.''
   The nuns have been under threat of dismissal since signing an
Oct. 7, 1984, advertisement in The New York Times that said ``a
diversity of opinion exists among committed Catholics'' on the issue
of abortion.
   The advertisement noted the church's view that abortion is always
wrong and added, ``there is a mistaken belief in American society
that this is the only legitimate Catholic position.''
   ``We are elated. This is an enormous victory for all women,'' the
two nuns said in a statement released through the Washington-based
dissent group.
   The nuns, who had said they expected to be expelled after being
given two warnings to disavow their support for abortion, could not
be reached for comment Sunday. They scheduled a news conference for
Thursday in Washington.
   Hussey has been a member of the order for 20 years, Ferraro for
25 years.
   Ferraro has claimed that ``the aim of the Vatican for years has
been to silence strong, independent women's communities and strong,
independent women.''
   ``There's no question. It's a very important victory for all
women,'' Frances Kissling, head of the dissident group, said Sunday.
   ``We felt it was very important that if anyone was going to act
against Barbara and Pat, it should be the Vatican, not the order. ...
   ``It should not be women expelling women.''
   Kissling said the Sisters of Notre Dame gave no other indication
why they decided not to expel the nuns.
   ``That is essentially what they have had to say,'' she said of
the statement released by the Vatican.
   Ferraro and Hussey were among 97 Catholics, including 22 other
nuns and four priests, who signed the advertisement, which was
written by Kissling's group.
   The other nuns and priests who signed it retracted their
statement and have had their cases closed by Rome ``without punitive
action against anyone,'' Kissling said.

<HEAD>Great-Granddad Becomes Father Of Much Larger Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Reeda Schumacher's childhood dream was
delayed until his own children were grown, but now the oldest man to
become a Roman Catholic priest in America is ready to minister to a
much larger family.
   Schumacher, who has six children, 13 grandchildren and one
great-grandchild, was ordained Saturday, just 24 days short of his
80th birthday. He celebrated his first mass Sunday.
   ``What he's taught all of us is, there's nothing you can't do if
you really want to do it _ he believes that,'' said Fran Lipton,
Schumacher's 48-year-old daughter, who was among 300 people
attending the service with her five brothers and several of the new
priest's grandchildren.
   Wearing a simple white robe, the bespectacled white-haired
Schumacher was ordained into the priesthood by Bishop Thomas
Tschoepe of Dallas, who gave Schumacher a chance after he was
rejected by scores of other church leaders because of his age.
   Schumacher said he felt nothing special about making church
history.
   ``Being a priest is all that concerned me,'' he said after the
ceremony at his home parish, St. Tarcissus Roman Catholic Church on
the city's Northwest Side.
   Schumacher took steps to attend a seminary when he was 17, but
deferred his plans to care for his widowed mother. He later got
married and had a family of his own.
   A few weeks after his wife, Genevieve, died in 1984 after 52
years of marriage, Schumacher telephoned the Chicago archdiocese and
said he wanted to be a priest.
   ``The kids were all taking care of themselves,'' he explained.
``I was then free to do what I originally wanted to do.''
   But officials in Chicago turned him down, saying he was 35 years
beyond the cutoff age of 40 for archdiocesan sponsorship of a priest.
   After 49 dioceses either rejected or ignored his letters,
Tschoepe promised to give him an assignment.
   Tschoepe's backing allowed Schumacher to enter the seminary, and
in May, he graduated from Holy Apostles Seminary in Cromwell, Conn.
   ``Bill impresses me as a vigorous man of about 60 or so,'' said
the 72-year-old Tschoepe.
   A man almost 80 years old ``can be a good priest,'' the bishop
said. ``With the experience they have they can be very, very
effective, especially in counseling, and their understanding of what
other people are going through is one of `I've been there.'''
   Schumacher will begin his service in Dallas, but requested to be
ordained in his neighborhood church, where he had been a lay leader
for 31 years.
   As a priest, Schumacher's main responsibilities will be working
with the elderly and sick people.
   ``I think I have a rapport with people older like myself, and I
know I have a rapport with people who are ill,'' Schumacher said.
   Schumacher pursued various careers, including insurance broker,
politician, credit manager, and job counselor for the state of
Illinois.
   After retiring from his government job at age 68, Schumacher
became a travel agent, a career he continued until he applied for
seminary, Mrs. Lipton said.
   ``As I was watching the service I thought, my mother would have
been proud to be there; but of course if she was there he wouldn't
have been,'' she said.

   Two U.S. Marines based in Okinawa died today when an
M-60 machine gun went off accidentally, the U.S. military reported.
   The accident took place at Camp Hansen, a Marine base on the
southern Japanese island, said Master Gunnery Sgt. Dale Hunter,
media liaison chief for U.S. Forces Japan.
   One of the Marines was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital
and the other died during surgery, Evans said.
   He said he did not know whether the accident occurred during a
training exercise. The victims' names were being withheld pending
notification of next of kin, he said.
   The Marine Corps was investigating the shootings, Hunter said.
   About 55,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed in Japan,
about 25,000 of them Marines.

<HEAD>Two Share $52 Million Jackpot, But Who Are They</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mystery replaced mania as attention
focused on two unidentified winners who today were eligible to claim
their share of the largest lottery jackpot in North American history
_ $52,236,232.
   The ticketholders, one who purchased a ticket in the state-run
Lotto 6-49 at a market near Sacramento, the other at a liquor store
in Fairfield, each will get about $1 million a year for the next two
decades.
   ``The winners are probably hiding out, not telling anybody what
they've got,'' said Jeanne Robinson, of Fairfield, 45 miles
northeast of San Francisco. ``There's a lot of people who'd like to
get hold of those little slips of paper with those magic numbers on
it.''
   Although the winning numbers were announced Saturday night,
holders of the winning tickets cannot claim their share of the
prize, $25,618,116, until the start of business today. The winners
were to be announced when they present their tickets at lottery
offices for verification.
   The odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in
14 million, said lottery officials. The winning numbers were 48, 42,
9, 14, 19, 31. Tickets cost $1 each.
   A man claiming to have purchased the winning ticket from Travis
Liquor and Deli, located in a remote shopping center outside Travis
Air Force Base, called store owner Michael Thomas on Sunday to check
the winning numbers.
   He did not identify or otherwise describe himself, but Thomas'
wife, Joann, said local residents assume the winner came from the
base, since there are few other residences or businesses nearby.
   At the Bel Air Market in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael,
about 90 miles northeast of San Francisco, reporters, store
employees and state officials gathered Sunday in hopes the
ticketholder would arrive to announce the win. No one did.
   ``They usually show up at the retail outlet,'' said Lottery
spokeswoman Susan Kossack, who was at the store. ``We've had big,
big winners never surface ... but with jackpots this size, I don't
think that will happen.''
   Both tickets had numbers that were picked automatically by the
Lotto computer terminal, rather than by the player, said Lottery
official Kay Krocke in Fairfield.
   Three days of frenzied Lotto playing preceded the drawing. At the
peak, sales reached $4 million an hour.
   At a bakery in Oakland, people were lined up 40 deep Saturday
afternoon to buy tickets. Several people had purchased $1,000 in
tickets, and people spending $50 were ``all over the place,'' said
bakery president Walter Harmon.
   Saturday's sales totaled more than $33 million, a one-day record,
spokesman Bob Taylor said. Weekly sales normally average about $23
million, officials said.
   Twenty-two tickets had five numbers plus a bonus number to divide
up the $6,490,836 second-place pool. Each of those tickets is worth
$295,038.
   A $46 million jackpot in Pennsylvania awarded in October to a man
and his female companion was the previous record for a North
American lottery payoff. The biggest previous California jackpot,
$25.4 million, was split by two players in October.

<HEAD>Socialists Defend Decision to Back Dissident Ruling Party Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The candidate representing Mexico's Socialist
Party has withdrawn from the presidential race and thrown his
support to a politician who heads a breakaway faction of the
governing party.
   Heberto Castillo stepped down as the Socialist candidate and
publicly endorsed Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the July 6 presidential
elections.
   On Sunday, Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, secretary general of the
Socialist Party, said the government party reacted to the decision
with ``enormous disgust'' and was preparing ``to strike'' at the
leftist coalition now unified behind Cardenas.
   The Socialist party is Mexico's second largest opposition group.
   Cardenas, whose popularity has risen sharply among the left,
accepted Castillo's endorsement while campaigning in the gulf coast
state of Veracruz.
   ``It is a great honor and a high responsibility for me to be the
Mexican Socialist Party candidate,'' he told reporters Friday night.
He said he had accepted the Socialists' 12-plank platform.
   Rincon Gallardo denied on Sunday that the Socialists' decision
was opportunistic. ``If we were in circumstances of weakness, unity
would not be worth it,'' he told reporters in remarks carried by the
Excelsior news agency.
   The Socialists generally finish in third place in elections,
behind the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and
the conservative National Action Party.
   But in this year's campaign, some polls indicate Cardenas is
trailing only Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI candidate. The PRI
has not lost a presidential or gubernatorial election since it was
founded in 1929.
   Cardenas heads the National Democratic Front coalition, which
includes the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, originally a
PRI spinoff, two smaller leftist parties, and followers of the
Democratic Current reform movement he led within the PRI last year.
   He broke away from the PRI when the party refused to accept a
platform that called for open primaries to choose candidates for
elections. The PRI traditionally selects its candidates in closed
session.
   The son of the late President Lazaro Cardenas, one of Mexico's
most revered politicians, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas served as governor of
the west coast state of Michoacan.

   Sweltering, triple-digit temperatures combined with summer
thunderstorms and showers today after breaking temperature records
in 15 states and unleashing tornadoes that skipped over eastern
Colorado.
   Temperatures were still in the 80s in the northern High Plains
early this morning following Sunday afternoon highs that ranged up
to 109 degrees at Glendive, Mont.
   The high of 94 degrees at International Falls, Minn., Sunday was
a record for the date, with the old record of 87 degrees set in
1976. Fifteen cities in the north-central United States reported
record highs Sunday. The mercury pushed to 108 degrees at Glasgow,
Mont., a record for the month of June.
   Tornadoes ripped through an area north of Denver Sunday
afternoon, tearing off part of the roof of one home, damaging others
and demolishing a trailer at a campground. There were no injuries
reported.
   The tornadoes were part of a wild afternoon of weather in the
Denver area that included heavy rain, hail and intense lightning.
   Meanwhile, thunderstorms whipped up severe weather in Florida and
Maine on Sunday afternoon but weakened during the evening.
   The Northeast had cloudy skies and scattered showers, along with
the northern and central Pacific coast to the northern Rockies.
   Clear skies prevailed across Nevada, the Mississippi Valley and
the Ohio Valley and the upper Great Lakes region.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across the
eastern Gulf Coast and Florida; scattered showers and thundertorms
across the northern Rockies and northern Plateau region with
widespsread showers across the Pacific Northwest into northern
California; mostly sunny skies over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 80s or 90s across much of
the nation; in the 50s across northern Washington, in the 60s and
70s from the Central Pacific coast region through much of Nevada;
also in the 60s and 70s from New England into the upper Ohio Valley
and eastern parts of the Great Lakes; from the mid 90s to near 100
degrees across the Arizona deserts through southern New Mexico into
the Rio Grande Valley and across the Northern Plains.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Sexton Summit, Ore., to 85 degrees at Billings, Mont.

   A wildfire fanned by gusty winds burned out of control today in
Southern California, while firefighters mopped up two others that
destroyed six homes, triggered evacuations and charred more than
2,000 acres.
   The fire in the Coxey Meadow area of the San Bernardino National
Forest near Hesperia in San Bernardino County was 60 percent
contained at 2:30 a.m., but control was at the mercy of the weather,
said Gail Nerseth, an interagency dispatcher with the U.S. Forest
Service.
   The fire, 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles, had burned 220
acres, but destroyed only one small mining shack, she said. Several
mining cabins and some electronic sites were threatened, however,
she said.
   ``We've got hot and flashy fuels and gusty, erratic winds.
Control time is still a question depending on the weather,'' she
said.
   Six homes were destroyed, another was damaged and some
residential evacuations were ordered near the Riverside County
community of Desert Hot Springs when fire scorched 1,800 acres there
Sunday, said county Fire Department spokeswoman Joanne Evans.
   Erratic winds fanned the flank of the fire toward Desert Hot
Springs, which has a population of 6,000 in the desert 110 miles
east of Los Angeles, but by early this morning, firefighters
reported 95 percent containment, meaning the blaze wasn't expanding
beyond the fire perimeter, she said.
   More than 200 firefighters manned fire lines. California Highway
62 and several other roads in the area were closed.
   Authorities were unsure what caused the fires.
   In Orange County, firefighters contained a 170-acre blaze near
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, 45 miles southeast of Los
Angeles.
   Three boys were questioned about the fire, which witnesses said
started Sunday as the trio played with a toy hobby rocket, said
Patti Range, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department.
   No one was injured and no structures were damaged, Ms. Range said.

   Pravda said today residents thought war had broken
out when a freight train packed with 120 tons of explosives blew up
at a rail crossing in a city near Gorky, killing at least 68 people
and injuring 230.
   ``First I saw a high column of flames shoot up. Then I heard a
rumbling, and then a great mushroom cloud rose,'' the official
Communist Party daily quoted a witness, V. Dormidontov, as saying.
   Soviet news reports said Saturday's blast in Arzamas, an
industrial city about 240 miles east of Moscow, flattened several
city blocks and tossed railroad cars and other vehicles like
feathers.
   Dozens of doctors were rushed to the city and rescue workers
continued today to go through the debris and Pravda said the true
death toll may never be known. In some areas, all that was left from
the blast were car wheels or rubble from multi-storied apartment
buildings, today's paper added.
   Soviet media said the blast involved three boxcars packed with
industrial explosives and destroyed the homes of 600 people. At
least eight children were among those killed.
   The official media's reporting of the disaster was among its most
detailed and rapid ever about such an accident _ an apparent sign of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness.
   What shocked Arzamas residents, Pravda said ``was not the damaged
houses or destroyed cars, but the crippled people calling for help.''
   The newspaper quoted one unidentified, weeping woman as saying:
``The first thing that came to my mind was, has it started?'' an
apparent reference to war.
   Witnesses said the explosion was so powerful that windows were
shattered about 1{ miles away and sections of track were discovered
a mile from the accident site, the news reports said.
   Pravda described the scene as being one of ``brief panic,'' but
said those who were not injured quickly rushed to help victims.
   More than 80 doctors were flown to Arzamas, a city of more than
90,000 people. Nearby residents rushed to offer blood and food for
the survivors, the media said.
   Pravda said the death toll would probably mount: ``How is it
possible to determine how many people were killed in cars parked
nearby?''
   It noted that, in some cases, only wheels were left at the site.
The story appeared on the back page of today's paper. There were no
photographs.
   A government commission was appointed to investigate the accident.
   The three boxcars carried industrial explosives intended for
geologists, mineworkers and builders, Tass said Sunday. The diesel
locomotive pulling the cars flipped over in the blast, the daily
Izvestia noted in its Sunday editions.
   Cars and trucks halted near the track, waiting for the train to
pass, ``were scattered about as though they were feathers,''
Izvestia said.
   The explosion set off small fires that were quickly extinguished
and derailed other freight cars, it said.
   Transport and municipal services also were damaged. Tass said
those left homeless would get new apartments and compensation for
damages.
   It was the most serious train accident reported since August
1987, when Soviet media said scores of people were killed after a
freight train collided with a passenger train in southern Russia.
   Accidents were never reported in such detail before Gorbachev
came to power in March 1985, but media stories of incidents have
become more common and specific, especially since the Chernobyl
nuclear accident in April 1986.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met
today with President Hafez Assad of Syria and said if the United
States and the Soviet Union can improve relations the countries in
the Middle East should be able to do the same.
   Shultz told Arab reporters in Damascus that Washington and Moscow
``have both agreed to address ourselves to the Middle East issues''
and said there would be more talks.
   In a news conference shortly before meeting with Assad, Shultz
noted that the superpowers have resolved many of their own disputes.
   ``If we can solve some of our problems, why can't the people in
the (Middle East) area come to grips'' with their own? he asked.
   The summit pointed the United States and Soviet Union in a more
cooperative direction in dealing with regional disputes, and Shultz
hopes Syria will take a cue from Moscow.
   Syria, which has been critical of the Shultz mission, is the
Soviet Union's principal ally in the Arab world and has the only
missile arsenal that can approach Israel's in capability.
   Israeli officials say Syria has put chemical warheads on some of
its missiles and that they can reach Israeli cities and military
targets.
   Speaking to the Arab journalists, Shultz repeated his contention
that the Palestinian state on the West Benk and Gaza Strip demanded
by Arabs ``just doesn't make any sense.''
   He said ``a confederation or an attachment to another state or
states'' was ``a more workable way of looking at it.''
   He suggested American states or Swiss cantons as possible models
for a future Palestinian entity.
   A day earlier, Shultz told Israel that its occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and ``frustration'' of Palestinian civil rights
were a ``dead-end street.''
   Shultz is reporting to Assad that the U.S. plan for Middle East
peace talks ran into a dead-end in Israel and Jordan.
   The secretary of state found neither King Hussein of Jordan nor
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir prepared to negotiate under
terms set by Washington.
   The plight of American hostages and the Syrian military
deployment in Lebanon were also on the agenda.
   Since there is virtually no U.S. contact with Iran, the Syrian
government remains the main U.S. channel for information from
Tehran. Syria is Iran's main Arab ally.
   While the U.S. State Department routinely affirms its support for
Lebanon's indpendence, Syrian influence in the war-battered country
is considered preferable to the rise of Iranian-sponsored Islamic
fundamentalists believed to hold U.S. and other foreign hostages
there.
   Shultz flew to Damascus from Cairo, where he had spent the night
after flying from Jerusalem where he had talks with Shamir.
   He was met at Damascus airport by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa before heading to the U.S. Embassy.
   Shultz, on his fourth trip to the region this year to promote his
peace plan, held two meetings with Shamir in Jerusalem on Sunday in
an effort to persuade him to agree to make a commitment to Jordan
that Israel will exchange part of the occupied territories for Arab
recogniton.
   In a public statement, Shultz told Israel, ``the continued
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the frustation of
Palestinian rights is a dead-end street.'' He added: ``The belief
that this can continue is an illusion.''
   He also spoke darkly of the prospect of another war in this
region where long-range missiles and chemical weapons have
proliferated.
   King Hussein, in talks Saturday with Shultz in Amman, insisted on
an Israeli commitment to withdraw as a precondition for accepting
the U.S. proposal for peace talks.
   Jordan controlled the West Bank from 1948 until 1967.
   The occupied lands were virtually shut down on Sunday for the
third day of a strike called by leaders of the Arab uprising to
protest Shultz's visit.
   Two Israelis and more than 200 Palestinians have died since
December as a result of violence in the West Bank and in the Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   The Shultz peace proposal calls for an international peace
conference in which the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France, as the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, would serve as hosts.
   The negotiations would be aimed at self-rule for 1.5 million
Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza, but not a separate
state. In a second stage, Israel and the Arabs would try to find an
overall settlement to their conflict.

   About 36,000 Palestinian high school students
today returned to classes for the first time in four months and
police accused five Arabs of starting a fire that destroyed hundreds
of acres in northern Israel.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir left today for the United States to
meet Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in a bid to further
improve relations between Israel and the Soviet Union.
   On Sunday, Israel's highest court upheld a deportation order
against Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American who advocates civil
disobedience against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   He was given a week to leave.
   The army has been opening grade schools and junior high schools
in the occupied lands over the past two weeks, citing a recent
reduction in violence.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, students burned tires and threw
stones at soldiers outside the Hussein School, an Arab reporter
said. He said the soldiers opened fire and one student was grazed by
a bullet.
   Several students and teachers in Ramallah, also in the West Bank,
said their return to school will not end demonstrations against
Israeli rule that have persisted for six months.
   ``It's good to be back in school because without being educated
we can't be liberated,'' said Ranna Bahu, a 17-year-old senior at
Friends Girls School. ``We can continue demonstrating after we take
our classes.''
   Police spokeswoman Edna Zigelshifer would not identify the five
Arabs arrested for setting a fire on Sunday that destroyed several
hundred acres of trees in northern Israel. She said only that they
were young men from villages about 80 miles north of Jerusalem.
   David Angel, a spokesman for an agency that manages most of
Israel's forest land, said Arabs were suspected of starting a series
of brush and forest fires that have destroyed 17,500 acres of woods
and pastures in the last five weeks.
   He said most of the fires appeared to be the work of Palestinians
acting in connection with the Arab uprising.
   Angel said he based his claim on the location of most of the
fires, many of which had been in fields bordering the West Bank.
   Last year, only 8,750 acres burned in Israel between May and
October, while this year's figure is already double, he said.
   In Jerusalem, the Supreme Court ruled that Awad ``harms the
security and public order'' and was illegally in Israel because he
did not have a valid residence permit. His lawyers argued that he
should be granted legal residence because he was born in Jerusalem.
   Awad's American-born wife, Nancy Nye, has denied government
charges her husband wrote leaflets encouraging the Arab uprising.
His ideas for civil disobedience have been adopted by underground
leaders of the uprising.
   Awad maintains a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio.
   Shamir announced his scheduled meeting with Shevardnadze at an
airport news conference before flying to a special U.N. session on
disarmament in New York.
   ``We have a lot to say to each other,'' he said. ``Our
discussions will focus on the attitude of the Soviet Union toward
regional issues, including Israel and the Middle East, the lack of
normal relations between us and the Soviet Union, and the problem of
Soviet Jews.''
   The scheduled meeting would be the latest in a series of talks
between Israeli and Soviet officials since Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power three years ago.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with the Jewish
state after the 1967 Middle East war and has been a staunch
supporter of Syria, Israel's most implacable foe.
   A military spokesman said, meanwhile, that the army was
experimenting with a new aluminum bullet to replace regular
ammunition used to quell violent demonstrations.
   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the new bullet is lighter than
the steel bullet and is designed to travel slower and be less apt to
penetrate skin when fired from a distance.
   Two Israelis and 201 Palestinians have died since Dec. 8 as a
result of the uprisings in the lands Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East war.
   An Israeli soldier was sentenced Sunday to a year in prison for
the fatal shooting of a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip last October.
The soldier was identified as Yaacov Tamir, an Ethiopian immigrant.

   A boy who watched a 10{-foot alligator
leap from a pond and kill his 4-year-old playmate said it seemed
like a dream until she disappeared underwater screaming.
   Game officers fired five shots to kill the bull alligator about
five hours later, after spotting the reptile on the bank of Hidden
Lake with the limp, 31-pound body of Erin Lynn Glover in its jaws.
   Erin, who was nicknamed ``Gizmo,'' was splashing through
ankle-deep water along the residential lake with her 8-year-old
brother, Justin, their Labrador puppy, and neighbor Jason
Kershanick, 9, on Saturday evening when the gator leaped out and
snapped up the girl in its teeth.
   ``While she was kicking, she must have kicked the alligator,''
Jason said Sunday. ``Right when she stopped kicking, the alligator
jumped up out of the water and started biting her two times in the
stomach. Then he dropped her and she crawled away, and then he got
out of the water more and grabbed her from the back and went in the
water.
   ``It was pretty quick,'' Jason said. ``It seemed like a
nightmare, a dream. But then the way she screamed, when I saw the
blood after he went in, then I realized it was real.''
   Alligators tend to pull their prey underwater, drowning them and
stashing the body for later feeding, wildlife officials said.
   ``She's just a precious looking girl. She's going to be missed,''
said Charlotte Kershanick, Jason's mother.
   ``People will be a lot more cautious,'' Mrs. Kershanick added.
``A lot of them are aggravated because they've complained about the
alligators being here, but nobody does anything. They ought to have
the ponds fenced in.''
   Richard LaTarski, a 64-year-old retiree, said he telephoned the
state game commission two years ago and asked them to get rid of the
alligator that killed Erin. It had killed ducks and turtles in the
neighborhood for at least five years, he said.
   The commission, LaTarski said, rejected his complaint and told
him the alligator wasn't ``causing any menace to anyone.''
   Commission spokesman Lt. Jim Farrior said Sunday that he had no
record of LaTarski's complaint.
   Erin's death was the sixth fatality and the 46th unprovoked
alligator attack in Florida since 1948, Farrior said.
   Alligators have been a protected species in Florida since the
mid-1960s, when their population dwindled after years of vigorous
hunting. But in recent years it has become clear that the species is
in no danger of extinction, Farrior said.
   State wildlife experts estimate there are 1 million alligators on
6.7 million acres of land.
   On Sept. 1, for the first time since 1962, the state will hold a
one-month gator hunt in which up to 3,000 will be taken.
   ``They occupy pretty much any body of water that would look like
an alligator lives there, and lots that don't,'' Farrior said.
   The small man-made lake was a popular spot for children, even
though it was full of alligators, residents said.
   ``All the kids around here played around all these lakes,'' said
Erin's stepfather, Ty Bowns, outside the family's home. ``I don't
think anybody took the alligators all that seriously.
   ``It was a shock. It will be a while getting over it,'' Bowns
said.
   The area is about 25 miles south of Sarasota on Florida's west
coast.

<HEAD>Senate Gives Final Approval To Anti-Nuclear Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The senate gave final approval today
to a bill banning nuclear weapons and nuclear-equipped warships from
the country in a move aimed at U.S. military bases in the
Philippines.
   Similar legislation is pending in the House of Representatives.
   Nineteen senators gave their approval to the bill on the third
and final reading. Three voted against the measure and one abstained.
   The bill, which received preliminary approval last month, sets
prison terms of up to 30 years for bringing nuclear weapons into the
country and up to 12 years imprisonment for importing nuclear
components.
   Supporters said the measure was aimed at the six American
military installations in the Philippines. As part of its defense
policy, the United States refuses to confirm or deny whether it has
deployed nuclear weapons in the Philippines.
   Senate President Jovito Salonga, a co-sponsor, hailed the measure
as a contribution to world disarmament.
   ``The Philippines should not be a promoter of the deadly arms
race,'' Salonga said. ``We should never be part of the problem. We
should be part of the solution.''
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense minister,
said he supported the bill because ``the presence of nuclear weapons
in our territory is inconsistent with the national interest.''
   Enrile criticized President Corazon Aquino for allegedly failing
to enforce a provision in the new constitution which states that the
country opposes nuclear weapons ``consistent with the national
interest.''
   Legal experts are divided over whether the phrase ``consistent
with the national interest'' makes the provision less than an
unequivocal nuclear weapons ban.
   The three senators who opposed the bill _ John Osmena, Neptali
Gonzalez and Mamintal Tamano _ said the measure would raise problems
with the United States over the future of the bases.
   The current bases agreement expires in 1991, and the constitution
requires that any extension be provided for by a bilateral treaty
subject to approval by two-thirds of the senate.
   Last April, the U.S. and Philippine governments began a review of
the current agreement. A successful outcome is expected to influence
Manila's decision on whether to allow the bases to remain after 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino says she will honor the agreement but refuses to say
whether she will support an extension.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told a House committee
today that the anti-nuclear bill was ``not completely satisfactory
to me.''
   Ramos called for unspecified amendments to give Mrs. Aquino
greater flexibility on the issue and in her dealings with the United
States.
   U.S. officials have said the measure would severely limit
American military operations, particularly those of the Navy at its
base at Subic Bay.
   Warships which are believed armed with nuclear weapons routinely
call at Subic Bay. Many are en route to the Persian Gulf to protect
commercial shipping from attacks related to the Iran-Iraq war.
   The senate bill bans the storage or transit of all nuclear
weapons as well as nuclear-equipped ships and aircraft. The original
measure also banned port calls by nuclear-powered ships.
   However, the bill was amended to allow nuclear-powered commercial
and research vessels to call at Philippine ports.

   Church leaders from around the world
marched to the pealing of bells today into this 14th century Russian
Orthodox monastery for the opening session of a three-day conference
marking the church's 1,000 anniversary.
   Hundreds of Soviets watched the 45-minute procession of church
officials from under the shade of maple trees and ancient churches
on the grounds of the Trinity-St. Sergius Monastery.
   Guests included Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie;
representatives of Pope John Paul II; and officials of dozens of
other Eastern and Western faiths.
   ``We have a long-standing relationship,'' Runcie told reporters
before entering the conference hall. ``We have not lost contact
through the centuries. On the 900th anniversary, we were the only
Western church to send a message.''
   The celebration of the Russian Orthodox Church's 1,000
anniversary, being commemorated in Moscow before moving to Kiev,
Leningrad and Vladimir, east of Moscow, drew about 500
representatives from more than 100 countries.
   The conference of church leaders will canonize nine new saints,
including Russia's most famous icon painter, Andrei Rublev, and 14th
century nobleman Dmitri Donskoy, who helped defeat the Tatars
dominating Russia.
   According to church documents, the conference also was to
consider an administrative charter for the church and discuss its
activities on behalf of world peace.
   The Zagorsk monastery was founded in 1345 by Holy Sergei of
Radonezh, and still contains a monastery as well as one of the
country's main seminaries.
   Christianity was introduced to Russia by Prince Vladimir in
Kievan Rus _ the ancient name of what is now the northern Soviet
republic of the Ukraine _ with a baptism ceremony on the banks of
the Dnieper River in 988.
   Church officials began the celebration Sunday in Moscow with a
service in Epiphany Cathedral led by 77-year-old Russian Orthodox
Patriarch Pimen, and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier next to the Kremlin.
   Soviet television showed Pimen and other Orthodox clergymen
officiating at the ceremony as the strains of a male choir filled
the opulently furbished church, which has five domes and three
altars and dates from 1731.
   Pope John Paul II did not attend the ceremonies, although he has
often expressed the desire to visit the Soviet Union. But the
Vatican said earlier that the Russian Orthodox Church did not extend
an invitation to the pope. Russian Orthodox churchmen have said John
Paul was invited.
   The pontiff has said he would go to the Soviet Union only on
condition that he be allowed to visit the heavily-Catholic Soviet
republics. But John Paul has said he has been twice denied
permission to visit Lithuania, one of the country's Catholic
heartlands.
   In a rare show of cooperation between church and state, the state
Ministry of Religion participated in organizing events linked to the
millennium.
   The government gave Pimen and 14 other church officials awards
Friday in honor of the millennium, and on Saturday state and church
officials announced jointly that cathedrals in the oldest monastery
_ the Pechersky Monastery in Kiev _ would be returned to the church.
   Pimen met this spring with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
the first such meeting since 1943 and pledged his support for the
Soviet leader's reform policies. Religious dissidents say such
cooperation is a sign of the church's subservience to the state,
which officially is athesitic.
   Dissidents planned their own services and seminars to give what
they said is a true picture of the situation of religious believers.
   A law that went into effect in 1929, the height of the Stalin-era
repression against the church, prohibits believers from organizing
charitable work, restricts religious education and requires
government registration of worshipers.
   Government officials now say that law is outdated, and will be
replaced by a new statute guaranteeing freedom of conscience. But
the law has not been published and neither church nor government
officials have revealed its contents.

<TEXT>
   Beirut newspapers said today ``energetic
negotiations'' were under way to release West German hostage Rudolf
Cordes.
   Several dailies quoted a Shiite Moslem news agency, the Daily
News, as saying the Bonn government was engaged in direct contacts
with the kidnappers holding Cordes in Beirut.
   ``These energetic negotiations might culminate in Cordes' release
within a few days in exchange for releasing Mohammed Ali and Abbas
Hamadi,'' the agency was quoted as saying. The Hamadis are Lebanese
brothers held in West Germany.
   Newspapers said the agency cited ``sources concerned with the
hostages' affair in Lebanon'' for its report.
   The agency is known to have close links with moderate Shiite
Moslem clerics in Lebanon, including Sheik Mohammed Mehdi
Shamsheddin, head of Lebanon's Supreme Shiite Council, and Sheik
Abdul-Amir Kabalan, the sect's senior religious judge.
   Cordes, a 53-year-old businessman, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987,
shortly after Mohammed Ali Hamadi was arrested in West Germany. A
group calling itself Holy Warriors for Freedom claimed June 8 it
abducted Cordes and said it would release him if the Hamadi brothers
were freed.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is to go on trial in July in Frankfurt on
charges of air piracy and murder in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner. In the hijacking, Shiite sky pirates held 39 Americans
captive for 17 days and killed a U.S. Navy diver.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, is serving a 13-year prison term for
involvement in kidnapping Cordes and another West German, Alfred
Schmidt.
   Schmidt, 48, was abducted in west Beirut Jan. 20, 1987 and freed
Sept. 7.
   The group holding Cordes is believed to be headed by the Hamadis'
older brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, chief of security for the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
   Hezbollah also is believed to be an umbrella for extremist
factions holding most of the 18 foreign hostages missing in Lebanon.
They include nine Americans.

<HEAD>Castro to Release Political Prisoners At O'Connor's Behest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In direct response to a personal appeal from
Cardinal John J. O'Connor, President Fidel Castro has agreed to
release the majority of more than 400 political prisoners held in
Cuban jails.
   ``Back two weeks ago, the Cuban ambassador to the United Nations
brought me a list of many, many names _ there must have been
hundreds,'' O'Connor said Sunday of a letter he received announcing
Castro's decision. ``It was a direct follow-up to my talks with
President Castro.''
   The cardinal, who left Sunday night on a trip to the Soviet
Union, had no timetable for the release. The State Department
confirmed that it had the list, but none of the names was released.
   Amnesty International, the worldwide human rights group,
estimated in its 1987 annual report that 450 political prisoners
were being held in Cuba.
   The New York Times, which reported the story in Sunday's paper,
said 385 of the 429 political prisoners remaining in Cuban jails
would be released.
   O'Connor discussed the possible release of the group during a
four-hour meeting with Castro in April, when the cardinal _ the
first bishop to visit Cuba in two decades _ made personal appeals
for several prisoners.
   ``I hope it is motivated by humanitarian purposes. But even if it
is not, it would have the political intention of sending some
signals that things are changing in Cuba,'' O'Connor told an
impromptu news conference after saying Mass in St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
   O'Connor added that he had received ``almost a commitment that no
`hardened criminals' would be sent to the United States'' _ a
concern stemming from the 1980 boat lift that brought hundreds of
freed Cuban criminals into the United States.
   Last Thursday, O'Connor said he met with Cuban Vice President Dr.
Carlos Rafael Rodriguez to discuss the list of prisoners list and
two other topics: sending AIDS specialists to Cuba and possibly
shipping some medicine to the country.
   The 44 prisoners who would not be released had been jailed since
shortly after Castro assumed power in 1959, the Times reported. The
Cuban leader said the 44 were convicted of ``grave and dangerous
violations.''
   Despite his optimism over the prisoner release and the medical
programs, O'Connor expressed concern that Castro could undo the
progress by attacking the United States in one of his speeches.
   ``I hope he doesn't come out with any foolish tirades against the
United States, because many of us are working to renew the
relationship between our two countries,'' he said.

<HEAD>URW Ratifies Firestone Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Rubber Workers union has ratified a
three-year contract with Firestone Inc. that could add as much as $4
an hour to workers' salaries and benefits, a union spokesman said.
   Union leaders and the company agreed last month on contract terms
to end a weeklong strike that began May 15. Balloting by local
members completed Sunday night assured ratification, said union
spokesman Curt Brown.
   Ninety-five percent of the members of Local 7 in Akron and 90
percent of the members of Local 138 in Noblesville, Ind., voted
Sunday in favor of the contract, Brown said. The locals were the
last to vote on the pact, and the results assured the contract's
ratification, he said.
   In other balloting over the past 10 days, workers at Des Moines,
Iowa; Decatur, Ill., and Russellville, Ark., approved the pact. The
only rejection vote came from workers in Oklahoma City.
   A URW contract must win approval both by a majority of the locals
and by a majority of the members it covers, Brown said. The
Firestone contract covers 4,700 members, he said.
   ``I feel the agreement will afford protection for these members
during the next three years and does offer the possibility of a wage
reopener in the third year,'' said Milan ``Mike'' Stone, URW
international president, in a statement after the Akron and
Noblesville votes.
   Brown said the contract's strengths include good health and
retirement benefits and protection against inflation.
   An average Firestone worker at the six plants earns $12.50 an
hour, according to the union. The proposed contract with Firestone
would provide a 25-cent-an-hour increase, but it would be considered
an advance to be deducted from future cost-of-living raises in
increments of no more than 10 cents a year. The cost-of-living
allowances were retroactive to May 23, Brown said.
   He said increases in both salary and benefits over the life of
the contract could amount to as much as $4 an hour.
   ``Right now, our average is just a little below what is the
average for the industry and this should help that,'' Brown said.
   Firestone workers' average earnings were lower, he said, because
of concessions made by workers at the Oklahoma City and Des Moines
plants.

   Ex-basketball star Spencer Haywood says his
cocaine addiction ruined his career and marriage, and led him to
hire a mobster to kill coach Paul Westhead after he suspended
Haywood during the 1979-80 NBA finals.
   ``I left the (Los Angeles) Forum and drove off in my Rolls that
night thinking one thought _ that Westhead must die,'' Haywood says
in a first-person article about his cocaine addiction in this week's
People magazine. ``I drove through the streets plotting the man's
murder.
   ``In the heat of anger and the daze of coke, I phoned an old
friend of mine in Detroit ... a genuine certified gangster. ... We
sat down and figured it out. Westhead lived in Palos Verdes, and we
got his street address. We would sabotage his car, mess with his
brake lining.''
   But the mother of the former Olympic basketball star persuaded
him not to go through with the plot against Westhead, then coach of
the Los Angeles Lakers.
   During the finals against the Philadelphia 76ers, Haywood passed
out at a practice after a night of smoking cocaine; that was
followed by an argument with teammates Jim Chones and Brad Holland.
Westhead responded with the suspension following Game 3.
   The Lakers went on to win the National Basketball Association
title under Westhead, who now coaches basketball at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles.
   When informed of Haywood's story, Westhead told the Los Angeles
Times, ``At the time, I did what I felt I had to do (suspend
Haywood) to save the team. And I would do it again.''
   In an interview this morning on NBC's ``Today Show,'' Haywood
said he thought he had never been under cocaine's influence during
an NBA game. ``I never got high and went out and played, but cocaine
lingers; you'd think you're clean, but your body is filled up with
cocaine.''
   Haywood, 39, who says he has remained free of drugs since 1984
treatment at a California rehabilitation center, heads his own real
estate company in Detroit, and is founder of a foundation that
sponsors basketball and educational summer camps for inner-city
youth.
   He blamed his drug use for helping to break up his marriage to
the fashion model Iman. The couple divorced last year.

   The owners of a coal mine where an
explosion killed dozens of miners have acknowledged that radio
contact was made with missing miners hours after the blast, but
broken off to search for more miners.
   Family members of some of the dead miners and a newspaper alleged
that rescue workers had bungled the search operation.
   Meanwhile, diggers today found one more body, bringing the total
of confirmed dead to 46. An initial police report said two bodies
were discovered today, but mine officials said one was the correct
number.
   Search teams continued to hunt for the last five missing workers,
but officials said there was little hope they would be found alive.
   For more than two days after the blast, which trapped 57 miners,
rescue authorities insisted there were no signs of life inside the
mine. But six miners were found alive in an air pocket on Saturday
and one of them said the six had made radio contact with rescuers a
few hours after the explosion.
   Owners of the mine in Borken acknowledged that a radio operator
had contacted a group of missing miners but that officials believed
at the time that the operator may have been seaking with a rescue
team.
   News of the radio contact sparked intense criticism in the news
media of how the rescue operation has been run.
   ``It is a scandal, that already on Wednesday radio contact had
been made with those who were finally rescued ... but that this
wasn't taken seriously,'' the Saarbreucker Zeitung newspaper said in
an editorial.
   Some miners' families contended rescue workers should have been
more concerned with searching for survivors than bringing up bodies.
   The six were discovered early Saturday after their sounds were
picked up by a television crew's microphone lowered into a shaft 500
feet beneath the earth.
   On Sunday, several hundred residents turned out for religious
services to remember the victims.
   At a news conference afterwards, Hermann Kraemer, board president
of Preussen Elektra, the company that owns the mine, said radio
contact was lost Wednesday after a radio operator told the men to
stop transmitting.
   Kraemer said the operator told the men to break contact because
he wanted to try and reach other possible survivors.
   Kraemer said that after the contact with the miners was lost,
radio operators tried unsuccessfully for 10 hours to re-establish
communication with them.
   ``The failure to regain contact led us to wonder whether there
had been an actual contact with the miners or with a search team,''
Kraemer said.
   But he said feverish efforts were already being made to locate
survivors in the area of the mine where the miners were eventually
found.

   The phones finally are ringing again for
thousands of suburban residents cut off by a fire at a switching
station nearly a month ago.
   ``I see a lot of very tired people out there,'' Bell spokeswoman
Hilary Anderson said Sunday, after technicians from five states
completed restoring service to all 35,000 customers affected by the
May 8 fire at the Illinois Bell switching station here.
   The Great Phone Outage ended at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, when Bell
officials transferred the final 18,000 customers from a damaged,
jury-rigged switch to a new, state-of-the-art digital unit for
connecting local and long-distance calls.
   ``More than 250 people worked around the clock to meet the
deadline,'' Ms. Anderson said.
   ``Everyone was on at least 12-hour shifts, and some people were
working double shifts,'' Ms. Anderson said. ``We brought in
technicians from all the other Ameritech companies _ in Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.''
   Company officials said the workers accomplished what normally
would have been a 50-week job in four weeks.
   ``It was a very good cutover, very uneventful,'' said Bell
spokesman Dick Hill.
   But, she added, ``I think I'm going to miss some of those times
when the phones weren't ringing off the hook.''
   About half of the phoneless customers were hooked up to the new
system on May 26, and the remainder were hooked up by Sunday.
   Although Illinois Bell has promised rebates, several businesses
have filed lawsuits accusing the utility of negligence. Illinois
Attorney General Neil Hartigan has filed a complaint with the
Illinois Commerce Commission seeking to have Bell pay for financial
losses.

<HEAD>Legislative Vote Close, But Socialists Favored In Runoffs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with Le Pen saying he wants to work with conservatives
to
defeat Socialists; EDITS thruout to UPDATE vote totals, other

<TEXT>
   Extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said today he
wanted to work with the center-right parties to defeat the
Socialists in next week's National Assembly runoff election.
   A coalition of conservatives showed surprising strength in
first-round voting for the National Assembly, but computer
projections said the Socialists are still likely to win a majority
in the 577-member legislature.
   The Socialist Party and the outgoing center-right majority
coalition were running almost even in Sunday's popular vote, leaving
President Francois Mitterrand's party with a narrow advantage
heading into Sunday's runoff.
   Mitterrand won re-election last month, soundly beating
center-right candidate Jacques Chirac.
   The extreme-right National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen, despite
getting about 10 percent of the vote, seemed unlikely to win any
seats in Parliament.
   Le Pen said he wanted to reach a mutual assistance pact with the
traditional right parties, something the conservative leaders have
said they would not do.
   ``If they withdraw their candidates everywhere that we're ahead,
which is normal, we would do the same for their candidates,'' Le Pen
said on French television.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said it was ``reasonable to think
that (Socialist Premier) Michel Rocard's government may be able to
count on a parliamentary majority.''
   But conservative leaders were heartened by a showing much better
than had been predicted in pre-election polls and called on their
forces to campaign hard in the final week.
   ``Today, anything is possible,'' said Alain Juppe, former budget
minister in Chirac's government.
   The turnout rate of 65.7 percent was the lowest in a legislative
election in France since World War II, and well below the 78.5
percent of the 1986 legislative election.
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, the Socialists had 37.6
percent compared with 37.7 percent for the conservative coalition,
11.3 percent for the Communists and 9.7 percent for the National
Front.
   Any candidate who received more than 50 percent of the vote
Sunday was elected. In districts where none received 50 percent, all
candidates with at least 12.5 percent had the right to compete in
Sunday's runoff _ but there was heavy pressure on candidates with no
chance of winning to withdraw.
   Computer projections by polling firms working for French
television networks said the Socialists should emerge with 290 to
330 seats in the National Assembly. At least 289 are needed for a
majority.
   With results in for 565 of 577 districts, Socialists and their
close allies were elected outright in 39 seats and leading in 185
others. The conservative Rally for the Republic and the center-right
Union for French Democracy, which ran a joint slate, won 75 seats
and were leading in 137.
   The Communists won one seat and were favored to win 22 more.
   The National Front was projected to win none, largely because the
voting system was changed by Chirac's government from a proportional
system to a winner-take-all system in each district, which favors
larger parties at the expense of smaller ones.
   The remaining seats were either too close to call, or going to
minor parties.
   From 1986 until last month's presidential election, Chirac and
Mitterrand shared power in an often contentious system the French
called ``cohabitation.''
   During his re-election campaign, Mitterrand said he wanted a new
Socialist-led government to work with the rightist-dominated
National Assembly in a break from the polarized tradition of French
politics.
   But four days after Mitterrand beat Chirac with 54 percent of the
vote, the Rocard government was appointed, loaded with hard-line
Socialists.
   Two days later, Mitterrand called legislative elections, saying
the government needed a solid majority before it could bring about a
promised ``opening'' to the political center.
   The legislative campaign, coming when the public seemed exhausted
by the presidential election, aroused little interest. Few issues
were debated.
   The Socialists said they would re-establish a wealth tax
abolished by the right in 1986, and use the money to pay a
guaranteed income to the poor.
   Rightists argued during the campaign that a Socialist majority
would go back to unpopular radical programs the Socialists enacted
after being elected in 1981, but largely abandoned over the next
five years.

<HEAD>Prisoners Riot After Ordered To Take Down Pin-Ups</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs to update number of men captured. Picks up
3rd graf pvs ``No guards....''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 prisoners who were told to remove pin-ups
from newly painted walls rioted and burned down much of a
minimum-security prison on the northwest England coast, officials
said today.
   The Home Office, which runs the police and prisons, said 11
prisoners who escaped during Sunday night's rioting at Haverigg
Prison near Millon, 281 miles from London, were still on the run.
Five others were captured.
   No guards were injured but one prisoner was hospitalized with a
suspected broken jaw and 10 were given first aid for minor injuries,
the Home Office said.
   The search for the escaped prisoners, involving about 100 police
officers, was being hampered because prison records were destroyed
in the rioting, Cumbria police said.
   The Home Office said no demands were issued by the prisoners.
   Scores of police with dogs joined prison guards to encircle the
facility. Firefighters waited for several hours before going in
because of the possibility of attack. At about 9 a.m., police said
everything was under control, although there was a great deal of
damage.
   ``Nearly every part of the institution has been burned down,''
said David Evans, general secretary of the Prison Officers
Association, in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   He said the prison's kitchen, clothing exchange stores, education
departments and several of its wings had been gutted by the blaze.
   Evans said his association had been warning the prison system for
months that ``there are insufficient staff throughout the penal
system'' and noted that fewer than 20 prison officers were on duty
at the time of the riot.
   Evans said the riot proved that inmates needed hardly any excuse
to cause trouble: ``If it is over the pin-ups, it merely confirms
our view that you don't need an excuse if you are a prisoner to burn
down an institution.''
   The jail, with 490 inmates, is a former Royal Air Force camp used
for prisoners either nearing release or considered not dangerous by
parole boards. The 390 prisoners who gave themselves up were
sheltered in a workshop, police said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Mike Andrews, D-Texas, introduced a bill
today to raise the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack and use part of
the revenue for an anti-smoking campaign aimed at teen-agers.
   Ninety percent of the $21.8 billion the bill would be expected to
raise over the next five years would be earmarked for reducing the
federal budget deficit, Andrews told a news conference. That would
leave about $440 million a year for anti-smoking advertising and
education, half of which would target minority communities, where
the percentage of smokers is higher than usual.
   The legislation, which Andrews says has little chance of passing
this year, is supported by 20 medical and social-welfare
organizations.
   ``Ninety percent of all smokers start by age 19 and 60 percent
begin by age 14,'' Andrews said. ``A 25-cent excise tax increase
will stop more than 1 million teen-agers from smoking each year.''
   Medical experts estimate that almost 1,000 Americans die each day
of smoking-related diseases.
   The federal tax on cigarettes is 16 cents a pack.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Railroad Drug-Testing Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, expanding its study of drug
testing in the workplace, today agreed to decide whether the
nation's railroads may require all employees involved in serious
accidents to take such tests.
   The court will review a ruling that struck down as an
unconstitutional invasion of privacy federal regulations requiring
such drug tests for railroad employees.
   The justices last February said they would decide whether the
U.S. Customs Service may conduct drug tests for those seeking
drug-enforcement jobs. A federal appeals court upheld such testing.
   Today, the justices said they will study the Customs Service and
railroad employees cases together. A decision is expected sometime
in 1989.
   The railroad drug-testing case stems from regulations issued by
the Federal Railroad Administration in 1985 to alleviate ``a
significant safety problem'' caused by alcohol and drug use by rail
employees.
   The regulations generally require railroads to conduct blood and
urine tests on employees directly involved in serious train
accidents.
   The regulations also authorize, but do not require, railroads to
administer breath and urine tests after certain accidents, incidents
or rule violations.
   The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
last Feb. 11 that such tests, conducted by private employers acting
for the government, are unreasonable searches banned by the
Constitution's Fourth Amendment.
   The appeals court noted that the regulations require the testing
of all members of a train's crew following certain accidents, even
in the absence of any ``particularized suspicion'' of drug or
alcohol use.
   ``Accidents, incidents or rule violations, by themselves, do not
create reasonable grounds for suspecting that tests will demonstrate
alcohol or drug impairment in any one railroad employee, much less
an entire train crew,'' the appeals court said.
   In the appeal acted on today, Reagan administration lawyers
argued that the 9th Circuit court was ``overstating the nature of
employee privacy interests and understating the competing safety
interests at stake.''
   In urging the justices to reinstate the federal drug-testing
regulations, the government lawyers said railroad accidents linked
to drug or alcohol use killed 42 people, injured 61, and caused
property damages estimated at $19 million from 1972 through 1983.
   The government's appeal said the railroad case raised issues that
should be studied together with those presented in the Customs
Service case.
   The case is Burnley vs. Railway Labor Executives Association,
87-1555.

   ``The Phantom of the Opera'' captured seven Tony
Awards, including best musical, but the fairy tale ``Into the
Woods'' deprived it of the prizes for musical score and book.
   ``Into the Woods'' also won best actress at Sunday night's
nationally televised awards presentations for the 1987-88 Broadway
season.
   ``Phantom,'' which is the season's biggest hit and is sold out
well into next year, is the second straight British import to win
for musical. Last year, ``Les Miserables'' won that award and seven
others.
   The exotic love story ``M. Butterfly'' won three awards,
including best play. Another multiple winner, also with three
awards, was the revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes.''
   In addition to musical, ``Phantom,'' the story of a disfigured
ghoul who abducts a beautiful singer at the Paris Opera, won the
musical categories for best actor, Michael Crawford; director,
Harold Prince; featured actress, Judy Kaye; and all three technical
awards: Maria Bjornson for sets and costumes and Andrew Bridge for
lighting.
   ``I'm honored,'' said its composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber. ``This
was rather unexpected.''
   ``There are so many ups and downs in this business. Well, the
time I have had here in New York,'' said a choked up Crawford, who
portrays the phantom. ``I know by the law of averages I must be due
to be knocked down by a truck.''
   Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, won for composer and author,
respectively, of ``Into the Woods.''
   ``I'm so glad that Stephen won, so I don't have to share this
with him,'' said Lapine in accepting the book award.
   Joanna Gleason won the best actress in the musical, in which she
plays the baker's wife who wants a child and turns to a witch for
help.
   ``For the past two years, people have thought I was the baker's
wife, but I felt more like Cinderella at the ball,'' Miss Gleason
said after winning her prize.
   ``M. Butterfly'' author David Henry Hwang thanked ``the real-life
French diplomat who carried on an affair for 20 years with a Chinese
actress without realizing she was a man. ...
   ``I like improbable plots but I'm not sure I could have made that
one up,'' Hwang said.
   In addition to best play, it won for director John Dexter and
actor B.D. Wong, who plays the singer and grasped his tailcoat and
curtsied after his award was announced.
   Ron Silver was named best actor for his portrayal of a cut-rate
Hollywood mogul in David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow,'' while Joan
Allen won best actress for her portrait of a bereaved dancer in
Lanford Wilson's ``Burn This.''
   Bill McCutcheon, a comic gangster on the lam in ``Anything
Goes,'' received the featured actor in a musical award.
   ``Thank God for letting me live this long to be here,'' said
McCutcheon. The 1934 Cole Porter musical also was named best revival
and received the choreography award, which went to Michael Smuin.
   L. Scott Caldwell received the featured actress in a play prize
for her portrayal of the boarding house owner's wife in ``Joe
Turner's Come and Gone'' by August Wilson.
   The singer Madonna, who is in ``Speed-the-Plow,'' presented a
special Tony to the South Coast Repertory Company of Costa Mesa,
Calif.
   In presenting the award to David Emmes and Martin Benson, who
founded it in 1964, she started by saying the microphone wasn't high
enough, but was told it was all right. She tried to stand in a bent
position, finally said, ``This isn't good for my posture,'' and
added, ``I'm being punished for not coming to rehearsal today.''
   The 42nd annual Tony Awards show, televised live from the
Minskoff Theater, was produced by Don Mischer, who picked up an Emmy
for his first try at producing the Tony show last year.
   The nominees were chosen by a 12-member panel of theater
professionals. The contenders were announced May 9, and then ballots
were sent to 730 journalists and members of the theatrical
profession.
   The Tonys are named for the late Antoinette Perry, a major figure
in the American Theater Wing, which held the first Tony Awards show
in 1947.
   The season, which ended May 29, was one of Broadway's best in
years despite a drop in the number of plays and musicals. Ticket
sales climbed to a record of more than $253 million, and attendance
jumped to 8.1 million from nearly 7 million the previous season.

<HEAD>Court To Consider Reinstating Conviction of Man Carrying Cocaine
at
Honolulu Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the drug-possession conviction of a man who was carrying
1,000 grams of cocaine when stopped by authorities at a Honolulu
airport.
   The court said it will review a ruling that drug enforcement
agents lacked adequate evidence to suspect the man was engaged in a
crime when they stopped him.
   The Reagan administration said the appeals court ruling in Andrew
Sokolow's case is a major impediment in the fight against illegal
drug dealing.
   ``Many of the factors present in this case ... are ones on which
narcotics agents routinely rely when intercepting drug couriers,''
Justice Department lawyers told the high court.
   Sokolow was stopped by Drug Enforcement Administration agents
July 25, 1984, as he returned to Honolulu from a trip to Miami.
   Authorities said he aroused their suspicions three days earlier
when he and a female companion departed for Miami.
   They said Sokolow, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, bought his
plane tickets with $2,100 in cash taken from a roll of money that
appeared to contain more than $4,000. He was wearing a black
jumpsuit and a great deal of gold jewelry, appeared nervous, and he
and the woman carried four handbags on the plane without checking
any luggage.
   Agents also suspected Sokolow was using an alias because the name
he gave the ticket agent was not the same as the name listed for the
telephone number he gave the agent.
   Sokolow's behavior, dress and demeanor fit the profile of a drug
courier, narcotics agents said.
   Sokolow pled gulty to possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute and was sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed
the conviction on grounds the cocaine should not have been used as
evidence against him. He said the drug agents violated his right
against unlawful search and seizure when they stopped him.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal threw out the conviction,
saying an officer's suspicion must ``be supported by evidence of
ongoing criminal activity.''
   ``Such behavior cannot be intuited from a hodgepodge assembly of
factors about individual character rather than criminal acts,'' the
appeals court said.
   The appeals court discounted the importance of Sokolow's
nervousness, stating: ``Nervousness would appear to be a normal
human reaction to air travel today, with a seemingly growing risk of
mid-air collision and the near certainty of delays that interrupt
the plans of travelers.''
   The Supreme Court, in a series of somewhat confusing rulings, has
upheld the use of so-called drug courier profiles by police.
   But the 9th Circuit court said while ``the vague and inchoate
profile presented here ... may generate good police work, absent
more it certaintly would generate bad law.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Sokolow, 87-1295.

   Democratic Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo today
officially announced his bid to unseat five-term incumbent U.S. Sen.
William V. Roth Jr.
   Woo said Roth, a Republican, has provided valuable service to the
state, but said that does not mean he ``has been innovative or that
he is in tune with the times.''
   He faces fellow Democrat Samuel Beard, an investment banker and a
political activist who has state party backing, in a September
primary. However, he never mentioned Beard in his announcement;
later, he said he's targeting his efforts toward Roth.
   Woo admitted he is the underdog, but said he was in the same
position four years ago in his first bid for elected public office.
   In the 1984 elections, he won the lieutenant governor's seat by
only about 500 votes to become the highest-ranking Chinese-American
in an elected state position.
   Woo, 50, a physicist who was a professor at the University of
Delaware, said his expertise will help to develop high technology
jobs and higher pay.
   ``When elected, I want to help establish a federal technology
policy to make America the `king of technology' again. Why? So
American workers will again be the highest paid in the world,'' Woo
said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today killed a bid by Sen.
John Melcher, D-Mont., to give the Senate a bigger hand in naming
members to a key federal committee that helps set monetary policy.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that dismissed a
challenge to the way some members are appointed to the Federal Open
Market Committee.
   The committee, part of the Federal Reserve System, directs the
buying and selling of government securities in the open market by
Federal Reserve banks.
   The committee's 12 members consist of the seven governors of the
Federal Reserve Board and five representatives of Federal Reserve
banks.
   The Federal Reserve Board governors are appointed by the
president with Senate approval. The five others are selected
annually by the boards of directors of the Reserve banks from among
the banks' presidents and first vice presidents.
   Melcher filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of how
the the five bank executives are named to the committee. He said
they also should be subject to Senate confirmation.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals threw out the suit last December. The
court said ruling on the merits of Melcher's claim would represent
undue judicial interference with the legislative process.
   Any change in the appointment of committee members must be left
to Congress, the appeals court said, adding that similar challenges
by other other senators met with a similar fate.
   Melcher said the changing national and world economy has given
the issue a greater urgency than ever. ``As the Federal Reserve
grows in importance, so does the injury to this plaintiff in the
deprivation of his rightful, constitutional role in the selection of
the officers who control it,'' he said.
   The case is Melcher vs. Federal Open Market Committee, 87-1546.

   Three consecutive days of talks have failed to
end the 13-week-old scriptwriters strike against movie and
television producers, but another meeting was scheduled for today.
   Neither side claimed progress.
   ``It's just real sensitive,'' Cheryl Rhoden, spokeswoman for the

evening.
   Negotiators also met Friday and Saturday and were scheduled to
resume talks this afternoon.
   Ms. Rhoden declined to comment on the issues discussed between
the guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers and said only that negotiations were proceeding.
   On Friday the guild sent letters to owners and managers of 198
ABC-TV affiliates nationwide, urging them to press ABC to give
ground in negotiations to prevent further delays in the start of the
fall TV season.
   The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute that centers on
payments or residuals and reruns of one-hour television shows.
Demand for one-hour shows in rerun, or syndication, is declining,
and the producers want to tie payments to a show's success in the
rerun market.
   The two sides also have been at odds over writers' demands for
more say over changes made in scripts during filming and more credit
on and off screen for their work.
   The guild has signed full-term contracts with about 80
independent producers, but the alliance contends none of its large
members have signed and that the producers who did defect employ
only a fraction of the 3,000 active writers.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Rape Conviction of Illinois Man</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand the rape
conviction of an Illinois man who wanted a judge to examine in
private the conversations his victim had with rape crisis counselors.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, refused to hear arguments
that an Illinois law granting absolute confidentiality to statements
made during rape crisis counseling violate a rape defendant's rights.
   The Illinois Supreme Court upheld the law as well as Leslie
Foggy's conviction for raping a Rock Island woman three years ago.
   Foggy was convicted of abducting and raping a 26-year-old woman
in Blackhawk State Park on July 18, 1985.
   He contended that he and the woman had consensual sex and that
she charged rape only after he refused to pay her $20.
   During his prosecution, Foggy's lawyer sought the release of
those comments made by the alleged victim or rape crisis counselors
that dealt with how to cope with the possible trauma of testifying
at trial.
   Illinois law previously had allowed judges to inspect such
documents privately in certain cases, but in 1985 the law was
changed to impose absolute confidentiality.
   In challenging that confidentiality, Foggy relied heavily on a
1987 Supreme Court ruling in a Pennsylvania rape case.
   In that decision, the justices said state officials could not be
forced to surrender confidential welfare records to people accused
of child abuse. But the court said such records could be examined
privately by a trial judge to determine whether they contain
information that might help exonerate a defendant.
   However, the Pennsylvania law under which the documents in that
case had been made confidential did not impose absolute
confidentiality, as does the Illinois law.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall voted to hear
Foggy's appeal but four votes are needed to grant review.
   The case is Foggy vs. Illinois, 87-6763.

<HEAD>Teens Better Adjusted Than Parents Think, Doctor Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Teen-agers often are better at adjusting to life
than their parents believe, says a doctor who led a study of 6,000
middle-class high school students in the United States and nine
other countries.
   Dr. Daniel Offer, director of the Center for the Study of
Adolescents at Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital, said in an
interview that he's optimistic about ``who will inherit the Earth.''
   ``I don't think we're leaving the world in the hands of groups
that are going to go off the deep end ... and they might even do a
better job of it,'' Offer said Sunday.
   The results of his research, conducted mostly in 1984 and 1985,
are the subject of a new book, ``The Teenage World,'' published by
Plenum Medical Books of New York.
   The teens surveyed were from Australia, Bangladesh, Hungary,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, Turkey, West Germany and the United
States.
   Offer conceded the results might be skewed because they covered
only middle-class teen-agers. And one psychiatrist cautioned that
psychological profiles based on the survey may be superficial.
   For the study, between 500 and 1,000 teenagers in each country
completed a psychological ``self-image'' questionnaire of 130 items
translated into their own languages.
   At least 100 boys and 100 girls in the 13-15 and 16-19 age groups
were surveyed by local researchers in each country, Offer said.
   The survey found that at least 73 percent of the youths in the 10
countries have a healthy image of themselves. It found them to be
generally self-confident, optimistic about their career goals, with
realistic social concerns.
   And more than 90 percent of the teen-agers in each country said
they felt good about their parents and their values.
   Only 12 percent felt they would not be able to take care of
themselves in the future. Offer said that contrasts with the image
of teen-agers ``as floundering, impulse-ridden, and oriented only to
immediate gratification.''
   ``What impressed us is ... that the majority of teenagers are
optimistic about their future and their main concern is economic,
getting a job that pays a good living,'' Offer said.
   ``There are differences, but there is the concept of a global
village and kids are becoming more alike.''
   He said the survey found similar differences between the sexes in
each country _ for example, he said, girls had a higher degree of
social awareness and commitment to others while boys coped better
with solving problems and showed more control of their emotions.
   The survey also turned up some distinct national characteristics.
Israeli and American teens, for example, were the most confident,
while Taiwanese were most likely to be confused.
   American teens tended to have more difficulties with
relationships among families and friends than teens in other
countries, Offer said.
   Dr. Richard C. Marohn, professor of clinical psychiatry at
Northwestern University, said Offer's research is important, but
added, ``it doesn't answer all the questions we have about
teen-agers.''

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal in Washington State Tax Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused 6-3 today to order
states to give refunds to businesses when a state tax is invalidated
as a violation of interstate commerce.
   The justices turned down an appeal asking them to apply
retroactively a 1987 ruling in which the high court struck down a
Washington state manufacturing tax that favored some in-state
businesses.
   Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia
voted to hear arguments in the case, but four votes are needed for
review.
   The court ruled last year that the Washington tax discriminated
unlawfully against interstate commerce because the levy, in effect,
was assessed only on products manufactured in Washington and sold to
out-of-state customers.
   Two dissenting justices said then that the decision could
``revolutionize the law of state taxation'' by drastically limiting
the states' discretion to structure their tax systems.
   The court sent the case back to the Washington Supreme Court to
determine whether the ruling should be applied retroactively _
thereby forcing the state to refund taxes to businesses that paid
the revenue.
   The state court ruled last January that the businesses are not
entitled to refunds.
   State officials estimated that refunds from 1980 through 1984
could exceed $423 million if the state were forced to pay them.
   The tax, challenged by 70 businesses, was imposed on gross
receipts of all manufacturing within the state.
   Manufacturers selling their products outside the state were
required to pay the tax. But those selling products only within
Washington's borders were exempt if they paid another gross receipts
tax on wholesale or retail sales.
   By paying either the wholesaling or retailing tax, a wholly
in-state business thus gained an exemption from the state
manufacturing tax. At the same time, companies doing interstate
business received no such exemption when paying business taxes in
other states.
   Companies that challenged the tax said that not forcing states to
repay unlawful taxes would neutralize the effect of last year's
ruling and discourage businesses from challenging other unfair taxes.
   The Council of State Chambers of Commerce, in support of the
companies' appeal, said that in recent years, ``state after state
has been taking a back door, prospective-only approach to adverse
large-dollar state tax test cases.''
   Even if businesses win in court they end up losing because they
do not receive any refunds, the organization said.
   The cases are National Can Corp. vs. Washington, 87-1629, and
Tyler Pipe Industries vs. Washington, 87-1767.

   A physician testified today that he saw an
ambulance crew properly administer resuscitation to a Navy recruit
who died after instructors forced him into a swimming pool during
lifesaver training.
   However, blood gas and chemistry tests indicated the
cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts en route to and at the
Pensacola Naval Hospital had failed, Lt. Cmdr. Steven Marshall
testified at an investigative hearing.
   The emergency-room doctor led off the third day of testimony in
the hearing to determine whether five instructors and their
commanding officer should be court-martialed for the March 2 death
of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., at Pensacola
Naval Air Station.
   In testimony Saturday, an instructor said safety procedures were
informal at the Navy Rescue Swimmer School.
   And a doctor testified Saturday that Mirecki died of apparent
heart failure, most likely caused by fear. Several classmates
testified Mirecki appeared to be terrified before his death.
   ``He was very frightened and definitely scared to death,'' Petty
Officer 1st Class Joseph W. Yankawich, the student class leader,
testified Sunday.
   The instructors, all enlisted men, are charged with involuntary
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery. They are accused of
dragging Mirecki into the pool and holding his head under water
while struggling with him until his collapsed and died.
   Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, commander of the Navy Rescue Swimmer
School, is accused of dereliction of duty.
   There was no formal policy requiring one or more instructors to
stay out of the water as safety observers, but it was understood
that procedure should be followed, testified Petty Officer 2nd Class
Bennie T. Giles, an instructor who was present but not charged.
   None of the instructors were designated to observe, but they took
turns doing so during drills, Giles said.
   Questioned by Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio, the investigating
officer, Giles said there was no release signal for students to give
if they were in trouble during practice rescue drills in which
instructors, playing the role of panicked drowning victims, grabbed
them in head holds.
   Another instructor not charged, Petty Officer 2nd Class Bobby
Powell, said it was policy to take a student to the deep end for
more training if he held on to the side of the pool.
   That's what happened to Mirecki, witnesses testified, but he
later climbed out. He said he wanted to quit the school and grabbed
an equipment rack, other students said.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Raymond W. Jablonowski, a safety
observer, said a group of instructors converged on Mirecki and
``more or less tossed'' him back into the pool.
   ``They put him back in the water,'' Giles said. ``He wasn't
thrown into the water. He was more or less slid into the water.''
   He said he could identify only one of the defendants, Petty
Officer 1st Class David J. Smith, as one of the instructors who
converged on Mirecki.
   Under questioning by lawyers for the defendants and government,
Giles denied that defendant Petty Officer 2nd Class John Zelenock
punched Mirecki and said he was unable to recall when other students
were told to turn away from the pool and sing the national anthem.
   Students had testified they were told to sing when Mirecki
allegedly was being forced, screaming for help, back into the pool.

<TEXT>
   The St. Marys River channel on the
Florida-Georgia border was blocked and closed to shipping today
after a dredging boat sank, leaking diesel fuel that endangered
nearby tidal marshes.
   The closed channel blocked both commercial traffic from the Port
of Fernandina and military traffic from Kings Bay Naval Submarine
Base, Coast Guard Cmdr. Henry Rohrs said in Jacksonville Sunday.
   The 168-foot Crest, which had been working to deepen the channel
to accommodate the Navy's nuclear Trident subs, foundered and sank
in high winds and heavy seas Saturday morning.
   Most of the leaking diesel oil floated into the Atlantic Ocean,
but some drifted inside the channel, where containment booms were
erected to protect up-river creeks.
   Officials hoped the containment booms would keep the tidal
marshes of Cumberland Island, part of the federal park system, from
being polluted.
   No oil had hit the marshes, Rohrs said.
   Seven crew members from the Great Lakes Dredging and Dock Co.
dredging boat were plucked from the water as it sank in the 50-foot
deep channel. A barge alongside broke away and drifted several miles
south along Fernandina Beach before it was secured.
   Coast Guard Capt. Robert O'Pezio, on-scene coordinator, said the
sunken dredge contained 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel _ or enough to
leak for three days at a rate of 500 gallons an hour.
   The dredging company, he said, will have to pay for cleaning up
the spill. Bill Moore, the company's project superintendent, said he
did not know what it would cost.

<HEAD>Court Gives Boost to State Referenda Sponsors in Colorado Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave a boost to groups
seeking to place referenda before state voters.
   The justices ruled unanimously that states permitting such
so-called initiatives may not prohibit groups from paying those who
gather petition signatures necessary to get an issue on the ballot.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said a Colorado
law that makes it a felony to pay those who circulate petitions is
unconstitutional.
   ``Colorado's prohibition of paid petition circulators restricts
access to the most effective, fundamental and perhaps economical
avenue of political discourse,'' he said.
   Many states permit citizens to place propositions on the ballot
through the initiative process. It has been particularly popular in
the West as a means of encouraging direct democracy.
   Stevens said the Colorado ban violates free speech rights of
referenda supporters because ``it limits the number of voices who
will convey (the supporters') message and the hours they can speak
and, therefore, limits the size of the audience they can reach.''
   Also, Stevens said, requiring those who solicit signatures to be
volunteers improperly reduces the chances the initiative will be
placed before the voters, ``limiting (the groups') ability to make
the matter the focus of statewide discussion.''
   The court upheld an appeals court decision which struck down the
Colorado law.
   The ban was challenged by Coloradans for Free Enterprise, a group
seeking to deregulate the trucking industry. The group said
regulation of the industry by the state Public Utility Commission
had created an unfair monopoly that excluded competition.
   The group sought in 1984 to place the deregulation initiative on
the state ballot by accumulating 46,737 signatures of registered
voters on petitions, or 5 percent of the state's qualified voters.
   The effort fell short as the state enforced its ban on paying
people to round up the required signatures.
   The ban was upheld by a federal judge but overturned by the 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   State officials said paying signature solicitors violates
grassroots petition drives by encouraging big spending and
high-pressure tactics by special interest groups.
   They also said that paying people to gather signatures encourages
fraud.
   Stevens said today there is no evidence to support the officials'
claims and added that there are adequate safeguards to prevent fraud.
   The case is Meyer vs. Grant, 87-920.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Request For Top-Secret Documents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case today
rejected a defense request for top-secret government documents but
again questioned whether Oliver L. North and three co-defendants
could get a fair trial on conspiracy charges.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell handed independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh a significant pre-trial victory by rejecting the
defense's wide-ranging request for ocuments relating to such
operations as U.S. intelligence gathering in Iran and efforts to
free American hostages in Lebanon.
   But the judge again expressed reservations about whether the
defendants could get a fair trial on charges they conspired to
defraud the government by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms
sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The prosecution's conspiracy case relates ``to a wide course of
conduct that has to explain why each individual was involved, what
got him into it, what he was doing before,'' Gesell said.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who was fired from the
National Security Council staff, former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter, and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, are charged together in three
counts of the 23-count indictment returned in March.
   The judge questioned whether the restrictions on the use of
classified documents in a public trial would unfairly inhibit the
defendants' ability to present evidence that they were merely acting
in accordance with procedures established for other covert
operations known to their superiors in the government.
   ``When a man is accused of a crime, he ought to be able to get on
the stand and tell his side of the story if he wants to,'' Gesell
said.
   But that right could be restricted if the defendants want to say
``I'd been doing these things time and time again in other covert
operations with the approval of Cabinet officials.''
   ``I really expect that if the defendants take the stand ... they
are going to spill all over with classified information,'' Gesell
said, adding that he had ``no stomach'' for censoring the
defendants' testimony.
   Testimony about other covert operations the defendants may have
participated in could be prohibited under the Classified Information
Procedures Act by the government's unwillingness to expose the
information in court, Gesell said.
   Such testimony would be important to the defense because it deals
with ``that abstract question that the jury must decide _ what was
on the man's mind'' when he participated in the Iran-Contra affair,
Gesell said.
   ``What causes the problem here is the conspiracy counts,'' the
judge said, repeating a reservation he voiced May 26 during a
hearing on the legal problems posed by limited immunity that North,
Poindexter and Hakim received from Congress for their testimony last
year before the Iran-Contra hearings on Capitol Hill.
   The judge suggested that the prosecution try other counts, which
include charges that North and Poindexter made false statements and
obstructed congressional inquiries into covert aid the
administration gave to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But Walsh argued that the ``conspiracy counts are really vital as
a unifying function in the indictment. The evidence in those counts
is going to be really straightforward.''
   Gesell's denial of the pre-trial discovery request came two days
after the CIA said in court papers that few people other than
President Reagan are cleared to review the highly sensitive material
sought by the defense.
   The CIA estimated that the defense request would require ``the
review of literally millions of pages of highly classified
documents.''
   The 87-page request included attempts by the defense to obtain
classified U.S.-Israeli communications when Israel shipped missiles
to Iran in 1985 to start the arms-for-hostage deals.

<HEAD>Court Expands Employee Protection in Illinois Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today expanded safeguards for
workers who claim they were mistreated by employers.
   The court ruled unanimously in a case from Illinois that states
may give protection to workers beyond that provided by federal labor
law so long as it doesn't force courts to interpret collective
bargaining agreements.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in his opinion for the court, said
federal law does not preclude such state lawsuits ``as long as the
state-law claim can be resolved without interpreting the (collective
bargaining) agreement itself.''
   The court reinstated a suit by Jonna Lingle, who was fired from
her Herrin, Ill., job for filing what her employer said was a false
claim for disability compensation.
   Ms. Lingle informed the Norge Division of Magic Chef in late 1984
that she had sustained an injury while working at its plant. She
asked that Norge pay her medical bills, as provided for under the
state's workers compensation law.
   Norge fired her a week later, asserting that she had filed a
false claim.
   Ms. Lingle was represented by a union whose contract with Norge
protected workers against firings without ``just cause.''
   The day she was fired, Ms. Lingle's union filed a grievance
against Norge. An arbitrator ruled that her firing had been contrary
to the contract's ``just cause'' provision, and Ms. Lingle was
reinstated as a Norge employee.
   Ms. Lingle also had sued Norge pending the outcome of the
grievance claim. She said her firing violated Illinois law.
   The relief available to her under that state law is greater than
the remedy she received in arbitration.
   For example, Ms. Lingle could be awarded punitive damages against
Norge and could be compensated for lost overtime payments under the
state law.
   Such awards were not available in the arbitration proeedings.
   Also, Ms. Lingle said she is entitled to additional relief under
the state law because the job to which she was reinstated was not as
desirable as the one she held before she was fired.
   A federal trial judge threw out Ms. Lingle's lawsuit on grounds
the state law is pre-empted by the federal Labor Management
Relations Act of 1947. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
the judge's ruling.
   But Stevens said today that a judge could decide under Illinois
law that Ms. Lingle was fired illegally in retaliation for filing
the workers compensation claim without deciding whether Norge had
violated the union contract.
   The case is Lingle vs. Norge, 87-259.

   Thirty-six illegal immigrants were saved
from the blistering heat of the desert and returned to the Mexican
border to find their way home. But some of them said the parting
might not be permanent.
   Most members of the group were in generally good condition when
found Saturday afternoon, despite having gone without food and water
for nearly a day in 108-degree heat.
   They were fortunate. About 70 bodies have been found in the same
general area of the southern Arizona desert since 1980, according to
figures released last summer by the U.S. Border Patrol.
   On Sunday, authorities loaded the latest group onto a bus and
drove them to the border city of Nogales.
   Thirty-one walked silently through a revolving steel gate into
the Mexican state of Sonora; the other five followed after
videotaping interviews.
   ``We have to think it over,'' said Gilberto Perez, 28, of the
possibility he would try again to reach the agricultural belt
surrounding Phoenix.
   Authorities said all 36, including one woman, came from the state
of Oaxaca 1,500 miles to the south.
   Enrique Gonzalez, 50, said a field hand in Oaxaca usually earns
about 7,000 pesos, or $3, a day.
   ``In my land, what we earn is nothing,'' he said.
   ``What is that (7,000 pesos) when I have eight children?''
Gonzalez asked. ``We eat only tortillas and beans.''
   Others said the group started off with flour tortillas, white
bread, canned beans and water but ran out on Friday, the third day
of a trek northward.
   Late Saturday morning, they found water in a brackish pond
tainted by tailings from the Silverbell copper mine about 35 miles
northwest of Tucson.
   A few hours later, they were in custody because two men left the
group to ask for help at a ranch near Silverbell.
   Three members of the group received intravenous fluids for
dehydration at Northwest Hospital in Tucson, a nurse said.
   ``We're glad nobody died. That's why you get this kind of
response. With this soaring heat, we responded with everything we
had in an attempt to save lives,'' said Ronald Dowdy, chief patrol
agent for the Border Patrol's Tucson sector.
   The group crossed the U.S.-Mexico border apparently by jumping
the international fence about 60 miles southwest of Tucson, and
headed north into the searing heat of the desert.
   Although members of the group said they crossed the border in
groups of four, five or six people, Border Patrol officials said
they suspected that a ``coyote,'' or border smuggler, organized the
attempt.

support.
   ``Six years does not necessarily provide a reasonable opportunity
to assert a claim on behalf of an illegimate child,'' Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor wrote for the court, which held that the deadline once
imposed by Pennsylvania for paternity lawsuits was unconstitutional.
   The justices in 1982 unanimously struck down a state law's ban on
paternity suits not filed within one year of the child's birth. In
1983, the court unanimously struck down a two-year deadline for such
suits.
   That 1983 decision hinted that the court might frown on state
laws preventing mothers from suing on behalf of any minor child _ in
effect condoning an 18-year deadline for paternity suits.
   Today's decision again offered such hints but the court stopped
short of saying so explicitly.
   In other action today, the high court:
   _Ruled unanimously that states may not prohibit groups from
paying those who gather petition signatures necessary to place a
referendum on state ballots.
   _Decided unanimously in a case from Illinois that states may give
protection to workers beyond that provided by federal labor law so
long as it doesn't force courts to interpret collective bargaining
agreements.
   _Agreed to decide whether railroads may require all employees
involved in serious accidents to submit to drug testing.
   _Let stand the rape conviction of an Illinois man who wanted a
judge to examine privately the conversations his victim had with
rape crisis counselors.
   _Refused, 6-3, to order states to give refunds to businesses when
a state tax is invalidated as a violation of interstate commerce.
   On the issue of paternity suit deadlines, Congress called for
such 18-year deadlines in the Child Support Enforcement Amendments
of 1984, but the justices passed up the chance to rule whether the
1984 federal law is binding on the states.
   Instead, the court ruled that Pennsylvania's former six-year
deadline violated constitutional rights of equal protection under
the law because legitimate children may sue for parental support at
any time.
   The case involved in today's ruling stemmed from the 1973 birth
in Pittsburgh of Tiffany Clark.
   Tiffany's mother, Cherlyn Clark, sued Gene Jeter in 1983 after he
stopped making voluntary, intermittent contributions to Tiffany's
support.
   According to court documents, blood tests showed a 99.3 percent
probability that Jeter was Tiffany's father.
   Jeter, defending himself against the paternity suit, cited the
six-year statute of limitations then in effect for such suits.
   While the litigation was pending, Pennsylvania changed the
relevant statute of limitations to 18 years.
   A state appeals court upheld the six-year deadline, and the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear Ms. Clark's appeal.
   Today, the high court provided Ms. Clark with a legal victory by
sending her case back to a state trial court.
   In her opinion, O'Connor noted that Pennsylvania law places no
time limit on lawsuits filed by illegitimate children who sue to
prove paternity for purposes of inheritance.
   She also noted that Pennsylvania does not impose any deadline for
lawsuits filed by men trying to prove paternity.
   ``It is questionable whether a state acts reasonably when it
requires most paternity and support actions to be brought within six
years of an illegitimate child's birth,'' O'Connor said.
   The case is Clark vs. Jeter, 87-5565.

   Explosions damaged commuter
railroads and Zulu officials said nine bus passengers were injured
by a fire bomb today as hundreds of thousands of black workers and
students joined a general strike.
   The scheduled three-day protest is the longest nationwide strike
called in several years. It takes place under new bans on political
activity by major anti-apartheid groups and black union federations,
which helped organize the strike.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the black homeland of KwaZulu and
an opponent of the protest, said four people were killed when a hand
grenade was thrown at a commuter bus. Later, an aide to Buthelezi
said the report had been incorrect and that nine passengers were
injured when a fire bomb was thrown at the vehicle.
   Police said five were hurt in the incident.
   No injuries were reported in bombing attacks on railway lines and
buses near Johannesburg and Pretoria or in the firebombing of the
Umgababa Station near Amanzimtoti, a black township outside Durban.
   Mining companies reported absentees only in some coal mines. Gold
and diamond mines, accounting for more than 60 percent of the
country's foreign currency earnings, operated normally.
   Black union leaders, who called for a national protest _ without
saying that it should be a general strike _ said they hoped to
pressure big business into demanding that the government ease its
crackdown on opponents of apartheid.
   Protest organizers called on workers to oppose a labor bill
before Parliament and restrictions on political activity, but
employers and union officials concede that the main purpose of the
strike is to test the strength of banned anti-apartheid groups.
   There was no official estimate of the number of people
participating in the protest. But based on the number of people who
normally use public transport, the absentees in major cities would
have totalled several hundred thousand.
   The government railroad service and private bus companies that
carry black workers from townships into city centers in Transvaal
and Natal provinces termed the general strike ``highly effective.''
   Absentee rates for black workers ranged from 30 percent in
Pretoria, to 95 percent in Durban and an estimated 80-90 percent in
Cape Town. Port Elizabeth, known as a center of political unrest,
had a near normal turnout.
   The Federated Chamber of Industries said the Johannesburg area
was the hardest hit by the strike, with a 90 percent absentee rate
among the black work force.
   The Johannesburg Stock Exchange reported an almost total strike
by its black workers, and the streets were empty and quiet.
   There were few milk or bakery deliveries, since most truck
drivers are black. Hospital supervisors in a Johannesburg medical
clinic had to wash floors and clean toilets, and whites operated
cash registers at many shops, which were empty of the usual crowds
of black customers.
   The South African automobile industry came to a standstill, with
all seven major assembly plants closing for three days.
   Many employers who normally institute a policy of ``no work _ no
pay'' during such illegal general strikes reacted more strongly this
time, obtaining court orders to prevent calls to strike and
threatening to dismiss absentees or cancel union contracts.
   The unions accused the managers of cooperating with alleged
government efforts to weaken the black labor movement.
   The national black chamber of commerce supported the protest and
agreed to close businesses through Wednesday.
   But in some townships near Cape Town, blacks were seen walking to
adjacent mixed-race communities to do their shopping and catch taxis
to work. Some cities reported more black worker turnout as the day
progressed.
   Scores of schools were empty in black townships around Soweto,
Cape Town and Durban, and three universities delayed final
examinations or canceled classes.
   Buses were stoned and there were reports of police gunfire in
Guguletu, a black township outside Cape Town. Journalists were
ordered from the area.
   Police and soldiers were reported patrolling in greater than
normal numbers in Cape Town and Johannesburg-area townships, and
standing guard at some train stations.
   Apartheid, by law and custom, establishes a racially segregated
society in which the nation's 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Marlen Wade Burford, 28, of Titusville, Fla., died of injuries
sustained in the accident Sunday night, a police statement said.
   Police said today they were trying to locate a second man who
also parachuted from the Palace Resort Hotel but apparently landed

   High winds apparently carried Burford into the wall at the

<HEAD>Court Rules Md., Okla., Men Wrongly Sentenced to Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court set aside the death sentence
of a convicted Maryland murderer by a 5-4 vote today, saying it
could not be sure he received a fair sentence.
   In a separate decision, the court ruled unanimously that a
convicted Oklahoma killer was wrongly sentenced to death for having
committed an ``especially heinous, atrocious or cruel'' crime.
   Both Ralph Mills in Maryland and William Thomas Cartwright in
Oklahoma are entitled to new sentencing trials, the court said.
   Mills was in the second year of a 30-year prison sentence for
murder when he used a makeshift knife to kill Paul Robin Brown in
the cell they shared at a state prison in Hagerstown, Md.
   Prison authorities said that prior to the Aug. 6, 1984 murder,
Mills had threatened to kill a previous cellmate if Mills'
complaints about visiting rights and other matters were not resolved.
   Mills was convicted and sentenced to death for Brown's murder.
   In challenging the sentence, Mills' lawyers argued that jurors
who sentenced him did not understand the judge's instructions about
determining whether any ``mitigating circumstances'' existed.
   Such mitigating factors indicate that life in prison, rather than
death, is the appropriate punishment.
   Mills' lawyers contended that the jurors thought they had to be
unanimous in finding any mitigating circumstance, and as a result
found none.
   Mills' appeal argued that if 11 jurors agreed that there were six
mitigating circumstances but one juror found none, the jury would
have to report that no mitigating circumstance existed.
   The result, the appeal said, could be that the death penalty was
imposed even though 11 jurors might think it was wholly
inappropriate.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
that the judge's instructions to jurors could be read in a way that
preserved Mills' death sentence.
   But writing for the high court today, Justice Harry A. Blackmun
said, ``There is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors
... in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed, may
well have thought they were precluded from considering any
mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of
a particular such circumstance.''
   If that were the case, Blackmun said, it would violate past
Supreme Court rulings that ``the sentencer must be permitted to
consider all mitigating evidence.''
   ``The possibility that a single juror could block such
consideration, and consequently require the jury to impose the death
penalty, is one we dare not risk,'' Blackmun said.
   Joining him were Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White,
Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to uphold
Mills' sentence.
   ``The instructions on the sentencing form and the charges given
to the jury in this case are unexceptionable, and (Mills') sentence
should be upheld,'' Rehnquist said.
   In the case from Oklahoma, Cartwright was convicted of killing
Hugh Riddle, his former boss, at Riddle's Muskogee County home in
1982.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Cartwright's murder
conviction but threw out his death sentence last year.
   The appeals court ruled that Oklahoma courts had interpreted part
of the state's death penalty law in an impermissibly overbroad way _
a view with which the Supreme Court unanimously agreed today.
   Oklahoma juries considering whether to impose death or life in
prison for convicted murderers are told to weigh all aggravating
circumstances against all mitigating circumstances.
   One of eight aggravating circumstances specified under Oklahoma
law is whether ``the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or
cruel.''
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that a similarly worded
aggravating circumstance in Georgia law could be applied only to
cases in which the victim suffered ``serious physical abuse'' before
death.
   After Cartwright's sentencing, Oklahoma courts have restricted
the ``heinous, atrocious or cruel'' language to those murders in
which torture or serious physical abuse occurred.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court today, said
Cartwright's sentence was based on an unconstitutionally vague
aggravating circumstance.
   The cases are Mills vs. Maryland, 87-5367, and Maynard vs.
Cartwright, 87-519.

<HEAD>Productivity Improves at Annual Rate of 3.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Productivity, a key measure of the U.S.
economy's competitiveness, improved at an annual rate of 3.6 percent
the first quarter of 1988, the government said today.
   The improved efficiency of non-farm businesses in churning out
goods and services from January through March was four times the 0.9
percent gain reported in preliminary figures last month.
   The increase compared with an 0.8 percent improvement in
productivity for all of 1987. Last year's figure included a 1
percent decline the last quarter, nearly negating a 4.2 percent
improvement the third quarter.
   The Commerce Department reported two weeks ago that the economy
as measured by the gross national product _ the total output of
goods and services in the country _ was 3.9 percent the first
quarter instead of 2.3 percent as earlier estimated.
   Output among non-farm businesses ressponsible for three-fourths
of the nation's economic activity grew at a much healthier 5.9
percent, the Labor Department said today, more than double the
earlier growth estimate of 2.7 percent.
   To achieve the higher output, businesses increased their total
employee hours by 2.2 percent, up from an earlier estimate of 1.7
percent.
   The department's report on productivity and costs indicated that
services rather than manufacturing accounted for most of the
improved efficiency, a reversal of past trends.
   In manufacturing, the revised productivity figures showed a 2.8
percent improvement for the quarter, down slightly from the 2.9
percent earlier estimate.
   The revised manufacturing output increase was 4.5 percent instead
of 4.3 percent. The additional hours worked to achieve the increase
totaled 1.6 percent instead of 1.3 percent as reported earlier.
   Meanwhile, hourly wages in manufacturing rose at an annual rate
of 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase since a
5.1 percent annualized boost the last quarter of 1985.
   The higher wages, compared with a 3.9 percent increase in the
earlier estimate and a 1.3 percent increase for all of 1987, raised
the labor costs associated with each item coming off the nation's
assembly lines by 1.7 percent annually instead of 1 percent as
reported earlier.
   It also gave factory workers their first real wage gain _ 1.2
percent _ after taking inflation into account. In 1987, the real,
inflation-adjusted income of manufacturing workers fell by 2.2
percent.
   Annual hourly wage gains for all workers in non-farm businesses
averaged 3.4 percent the first quarter, keeping them exactly even
with inflation.
   The Labor Department said the quarter was the fifth in a row
without a real increase in hourly wages _ a phenomenon that has
occurred only twice previously _ in 1979-80 and in 1980-81.
   The labor costs associated with each unit of goods or services
produced by non-farm businesses declined at an annual rate of 0.2
percent the first quarter, compared with a 4.5 percent increase the
last quarter of 1987.

<TEXT>
   Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, one of the
administration's staunchest African allies, will meet with President
Reagan this week, the White House announced today.
   Mobutu, who has been in power since 1965, last met with Reagan in
December 1986.
   The Zairean leader is also expected to meet with officials of the
World Bank, which last year granted his country an $80 million loan.
The funds were released after Mobutu undertook a reform program
including improvement of tax collection, promotion of private
enterprise and deregulation of prices.
   With nine neighbors and the second-largest land area in
sub-Saharan Africa, Zaire is regarded in Washington as one of
Africa's most strategically important countries. Mobutu pleased
American officials by sending troops to Chad to help it fight Libya.
   But Amnesty International and other human rights groups have
criticized Zaire for human rights abuses, including torture of
prisoners.
   Mobutu is also meeting with members of the congressional black
caucus to answer questions about allegations of human rights abuses
by his government, a congressional staffer said.
   The closed meeting on Wednesday will include discussion of the
cases of opposition leaders sent into internal exile, said the staff
member who asked not to be named.
   Last month 58 members of Congress wrote Mobutu to protest the
banishment of Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, a former minister of the
interior.

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governors of Ohio and New York today
proposed a national policy that would sharply reduce acid rain while
protecting the interests of the coal-producing states.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste
recommended in a joint statement a 10-million-ton reduction in
sulfur dioxide emissions from utility sources by the year 2003. The
proposal also would authorize $900 million a year to finance up to
50 percent of the capital costs.
   The plan will be proposed to Congress as an amendment to the
Clean Air Act. Cuomo and Celeste, both Democrats, said they will
push the agreement as a compromise to the other legislative
proposals in Washington, bogged down in regional fighting, to
control acid rain.
   Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have been
blamed as a major cause of acid rain, which environmentalists say is
destroying waters and woodlands in the Northeast. Much of the sulfur
dioxide comes from coal-burning power plants along the Ohio River.
   New York is one of eight Northeastern states involved in a U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals suit in Washington against the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The states are protesting the EPA's
refusal to revise the air pollution control plans of Ohio, Michigan,
Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Illinois to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions in those states.
   The plan calls for reductions in sulfur dioxide emmissions in
three phases: 3.5 million tons by 1993, another 4.5 million tons by
1998 and another 2 million tons by 2003.
   States would receive about $900 million to pay for the cost of
compliance. More than two-thirds would be paid by the oil industry
and one-third by federal officials. The polluters themselves would
have to raise about $900 million under the deal.
   The agreement would also establish a 10-year, $2.5 billion
expanded clean coal technology program to achieve reductions in
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. That money would be
handed out on the basis of 50 percent matching grants to fund
demonstrations of new technologies.
   In the joint statement, Cuomo said, ``It is imperative to break
the impasse that now exists in Congress.''
   Celeste's press secretary, Debra Phillips, said the governor
considers the agreement ``a balance between preserving jobs and
cleaning up the environment.''
   But a state senator from Ohio's richest coal county, Republican
Robert Ney from Belmont County, said the agreement is a ``hard slap
across the face'' of Ohio's coal miners.
   Ney said he was upset that a deal by Celeste on acid rain might
conflict with the Ohio Legislature's endorsement last week of a
resolution calling on that state's congressional delegation to
oppose the Clean Air Act and tighter sulfur dioxide emissions.
   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Richard Shank said
the lawsuit is not involved in the agreement.
   In Albany, N.Y., Cuomo's chief spokesman, Gary Fryer, said the
proposal stemmed from a discussion between the two governors last
July at a meeting of the national Democratic Governors' Association
on Mackinac Island, Mich.

   President Reagan said today his greatest
victory at the Moscow summit came not in superpower negotiations but
in the ``words of faith, words of freedom, words of truth'' that he
gave to the Soviet people.
   ``It made me feel humble, that's the only way you could feel, it
made me think that visiting Moscow on behalf of the American people
was one of the highest privileges of my life,'' Reagan said a speech
summing up his talks last week with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Noting ``how much things have changed'' because of the friendly
outcome of the five-day summit, Reagan began by greeting the Soviet
delegation attending his address before the World Gas Conference.
   The president said he left Moscow with an ``impression of change,
an impression of new possibilities, of new hope'' stemming from
Gorbachev's economic and social reforms.
   Reagan said he was encouraged by his talks with Gorbachev on arms
control, regional and bilateral matters and human rights, and his
meetings with Soviet dissidents, refuseniks and Russian Orthodox
monks.
   He recalled one published report about an elderly woman who had
witnessed the president's stroll through a Moscow street and was
quoted as saying, ``I like it that he says, God bless you.''
   ``There perhaps lies the greatest significance of what took place
in Moscow last week _ not that Ronald Reagan spoke there,'' Reagan
said.
   ``I was only giving voice to the abiding beliefs of the American
people, indeed of free people everywhere.
   ``No, it was that the words that were spoken were words of faith,
words of freedom, words of truth. Unarmed truth is irresistible.''
   Since the end of the May 29-June 2 summit, Reagan has portrayed
his sessions with Gorbachev as a turning point in East-West affairs.
   On Saturday, Reagan said his Kremlin talks sowed the ``seeds of
freedom and greater trust'' that he hopes will lead to increased
liberty for the Soviet people.
   ``I just have to believe that, in ways we may not even be able to
guess, those seeds will take root and grow,'' the president said in
his weekly radio address from the Oval Office.
   The president pointed to his and Gorbachev's exchange of
ratification documents for the treaty banning medium-range nuclear
missiles, calling it ``the event that held perhaps the most
immediate historic importance'' during the summit.
   The two leaders had signed the accord at their last meeting in
December.
   ``The significance of this treaty can hardly be overstated,''
Reagan said, noting that it marks the first agreement banning an
entire class of missiles.
   ``These missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the
map or placed in storage; they will have been destroyed,'' he said.
   Although the two sides remained far apart on many matters
involving a new treaty slashing the far more dangerous strategic
nuclear missiles, Reagan said he and the Soviet leader ``moved
ahead'' on the issue.
   On other matters, Reagan said he and Gorbachev agreed that the
Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan ``could serve as a model for
settling other regional conflicts.''
   And turning to one of the most contentious issues of the summit,
the president pointed to ``a key part'' of his agenda, human rights.
   ``Recently the Soviets have begun to show somewhat more respect
for human rights,'' he said, noting the release of some 300
political detainees.
   The president also mentioned his own meetings with students, and
with nearly 100 dissidents and refuseniks _ those who opposed Soviet
policies or have been refused permission to leave the Soviet Union.
   ``It is my hope that what took place in my Moscow visit will lead
to still greater individual freedom for the peoples of the Soviet
Union,'' he said.

   Israel's national El Al Airlines has rejected a
deal worth tens of thousands of dollars to transport live pigs from
the United States to Europe to avoid offending Orthodox Jews, a
spokesman said.
   ``We don't feed our passengers un-kosher food, and we wouldn't
want to put pigs in the bellies of our planes,'' said El Al
spokesman Nachman Kleinman.
   Jewish dietary laws prohibit Jews from eating pork.
   Kleinman said in a telephone interview that the airline had
recently considered the offer to fly 12 tons of pigs to Europe for
breeding because it would have been worth ``tens of thousands of
dollars.''
   ``It's such a touchy subject, and some people would be offended
by it, so we decided against the deal,'' Kleinman added.
   The offer was by a North American company that Kleinman would not

<HEAD>4,000-Year-Old Musical Instrument Found in Grave on Crete</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks like a child's rattle, but it is
made of clay and was placed in a communal grave on the island of
Crete almost 4,000 years ago.
   The unique find from a Minoan cemetery outside the village of
Arkhanes is a sistrum, a percussion instrument used at religious
ceremonies in ancient times.
   In more than 100 years of digging on Crete, the home of Europe's
first high civilization in the Bronze Age, nobody had ever unearthed
a restorable musical instrument.
   ``It's the first time, we've recovered a sound created by the
Minoans...we've got a noise they heard,'' said Yiannis Sakellarakis,
the archaeologist who made the discovery last summer.
   ``It's a light sound that's hard to describe...clear and distinct
but an earthy sort of note,'' he said in a weekend interview.
   The Minoan civilization is named after King Minos, a legendary
ruler who kept a half-man, half-bull monster called the Minotaur
imprisoned in a labyrinth beneath his palace at Knossos.
   Arkhanes is 10 miles south of Knossos in a hilly but fertile
wine-growing district of central Crete that was densely populated in
Minoan times.
   The sistrum is a flat 4-inch diameter circle of unpainted clay
with a handle. The face had two parallel wooden slats across it, and
clay discs were slotted loosely between the slats.
   ``If you shook the instrument from side to side, you'd get a
light rythmic sound from the discs rattling against each other and
the clay frame,'' said Sakellarakis, a director of Greece's National
Archaeological Museum.
   ``It's a fantastic find. We know there was ritual drinking at
Minoan burials, and perhaps this indicates there was music and
singing or chanting as well,'' said Sandy McGillivray, an associate
professor of archaeology at Columbia University in New York.
   The sistrum was unearthed in a stone-walled burial chamber _ or
ossuary _ containing the skeletons and personal items of more than
150 Minoans. The grave offerings were mostly vases but included
carved ivory seals that probably belonged to the wealthier members
of a family clan.
   Sakellarakis said the sistrum apparently dates from around 1900
B.C. Some painted clay cups from that period were found next to the
instrument.
   ``We found the clay circle broken into two pieces. Then we
associated it with the three discs and realized we'd got a very
early sistrum,'' he said.
   Music and dancing were part of a sophisticated ancient lifestyle
on Crete, illustrated in wall-paintings, sealstones and carved stone
vases found in the sprawling Minoan palaces and country villas built
throughout the island.
   One vase made around 1500 B.C. shows a middle-aged man
brandishing a sistrum as he leads a group of singing worshipers.
   Sakellarakis said the sistrums found in Egypt ``were invariably
made of metal, not clay, and usually were associated with the cult
of Isis.'' Isis was worshipped in ancient Egypt as a goddess of
fertility who could also cure the sick.
   Sakellarakis and his wife, Effie, have excavated around Arkhanes
since the mid-1960s. In addition to the cemetery excavation, they
have unearthed part of a Minoan palace in Arkhanes and a shrine on
nearby Mount Iuktas, where it is believed the Minoans carried out a
human sacrifice.

   A Hungarian pilot strayed into Romanian
airspace after making a navigational error and landed 7.5 miles
inside Romania, the offical MTI news agency said Monday.
   Ferenc Steinbinder landed his glider near the town of Salonta on
Saturday, the report said. It described him as a member of an
aviation club of the Hungarian army but did not say if he was a
member of the armed forces.
   The report did not give further details but it made clear the
pilot was still in Romania.
   ``The competent (Hungarian) bodies have taken measures to bring
the pilot and the glider home,'' MTI said, without providing
specifics.
   Despite their Warsaw Pact membership and allegiance to communist
doctrine, Hungary and Romania have been deeply split over ethnic and
historical issues involving the central Romanian province of
Transylvania.
   About 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians live in the province.
   Budapest charges that Romania is discriminating against ethnic
Hungarians. Budapest denies the allegation and accuses Romania of
meddling in its affairs.

<TEXT>
   British balloonist Per Lindstrand broke the
world altitude record for a hot-air balloon today, floating more
than 11 miles above the Earth's surface, his spokeswoman said.
   After a 3{-hour flight in his pressurized gondola, Lindstrand
landed about 70 miles northeast of his launch site, some 27 miles
north of Laredo.
   ``It was an ideal landing,'' said Lisa Boell, a spokeswoman for
Lindstrand's crew.
   Ms. Boell said Linstrand set an unofficial record at 58,700. At
7:02 a.m., Lindstrand topped the 55,134-foot record set in 1980 by
Julian Nott. Last year, Lindstrand and Richard Brandson became the
first people to cross the Atlantic in a hot-air balloon.
   Houston Air Traffic Control officials who were tracking
Lindstrand's balloon on radar said the Swedish-born engineer had
topped 58,700 feet at 7:10 a.m.
   Two sealed cameras that automatically filmed the craft's
altimeter readings and a barograph strapped to the outside of the
craft will be examined to verify the record.
   Lindstrand's return to Earth was delayed by natural solar heating
inside the balloon, a spokesman said. When he had dropped to 12,000
feet, Lindstrand relit the butane burners on the craft to slow his
fall. At that point, he was falling at 500 feet per minute.
   Lindstand's Stratoquest lifted off at 5:42 a.m., just three
minutes after he and his wife arrived at the launch site. Lindstrand
hoped the $200,000 flight would break the 60,000-feet barier,
considered until now to be technically impossible because of a lack
of oxygen in the atmosphere needed for the balloon's burners.
   His assault on the world record, first scheduled for June 1, was
repeatedly delayed because of storms or high wind.
   On Sunday, launch master Paul Dickenson aborted the flight for
the fifth time when ground wind proved too strong only 10 minutes
from the proposed liftoff time.
   A problem at liftoff left two of four 100-pound sandbags attached
to the balloon, threatening the mission, project coordinator Pete
Mason said. But Lindstrand climbed out of his capsule to cut away
the sandbags.
   ``It's obviously very risky, but if you recall when he took off
for his Atlantic flight, he lost a fuel tank and also had 500 pounds
of sand bags still attached,'' Mason said. ``He climbed out at 8,000
feet and cut them free and still managed to cross the Atlantic.''
   Last year, Lindstrand and Brandson, a British millionaire, became
the first people to cross the Atlantic in a hot air balloon. But
explosive charges that were to release their capsule failed and the
two ended up in the Irish Sea for 2{ hours.
   The trans-Atlantic flight set hot air balloon records for speed
at 100 mph, duration at 31 hours and 41 minutes, and distance at
3,075 miles.

   Jesse Jackson's half-brother was freed on
$500,000 bond after being charged with hiring someone to attack a
witness to a slaying, police said.
   , Janice Denice Rosemond was stabbed
repeatedly in December 1987, after she had testified before a grand
jury in Chicago about the slaying of Leroy Barber.
   Barber was shot to death in January 1986 outside a plaza in
Greenville that Robinson owns.
   The grand jury was investigating the El Rukn gang in Chicago and
looked into the Barber slaying because an informant had testified
that the gang had Barber killed for harassing Robinson, according
the Chicago Tribune. Robinson denied any connection to Barber's
death.
   ``From what we understand, there had been several altercations
over the years between Barber and Robinson. He had been working for
Robinson in Chicago and come back to Greenville,'' said Morton.
``They'd gotten into a fight a couple of weeks before'' Barber was
shot.
   Morton said Barber was shot once in the head by an unidentified
assailant and ``Rosemond, unfortunately, was a witness to that.''
   No one has been charged with the slaying, but the investigation
was continuing, Johnson said.

National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The number is 1-900-410-NOAA.
   Calls cost 50 cents for the first minute and 35 cents for each
additional minute. The average call costs 85 cents.
   NOAA officials say the hotline has proved popular in the past.
Last year 52,000 calls were made when Hurricane Floyd and an unnamed
tropical storm threatened. And in 1985, when hurricanes Gloria and
Elena threatened the East Coast, some 700,000 calls were received.
   The hotline is capable of handling 7,200 calls at any one time.
Non-AT&T telephone subscribers can reach the service by first
dialing 1-0-288-900.
   The hotline is sponsored jointly as a public service by the
National Weather Service, NBC News and USA Today.

<HEAD>False Ad Charges Can Cost Companies Millions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Being charged with false advertising can cost a
company millions of dollars, even if no fine is ever levied, the
Federal Trade Commission reported Monday.
   At the same time, the commission announced that the marketer of
Dream Away diet pills has agreed to set up a $1.1 million fund to
repay consumers in a false advertising case.
   When false advertising charges are brought against a company, the
market price of that company's stock declines, often significantly,
the commission said in its analysis of the effects of advertising
regulation.
   For a company with a value of $500 million, the drop in stock
prices could amount to $20 million in lost value, according to David
Scheffman, director of the FTC's bureau of economics.
   This decline is a measure of the market's estimate of the problem
the company will have in selling its products as a result of the
false advertising charges, Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver said.
   Thus, while the commission rarely levies fines against companies
in advertising cases, just bringing the accusation has a significant
effect, even if the charges eventually are dropped.
   Generally, when the FTC brings false advertising charges, the
case is settled with a consent agreement, in which the company,
while not admitting any wrongdoing, promises not to do it again.
Only if there is a subsequent violation of that promise are fines
likely.
   Such instances are rare, Oliver noted, the companies having
already suffered damage to reputation, costs of litigation and loss
of stock value and business.
   The study focused on 122 cases between 1962 and 1985 in which the
FTC brought false advertising charges. In 74 cases the companies
agreed to a consent order settling the case, while 48 contested the
case.
   In the cases settled by consent order, the companies' stock value
lost an average of 2.5 percent in the five days following the
announcement, the study found.
   The greatest effect was seen in cases in which a company
contested the FTC charges in court, but eventually lost. Abnormal
stock price losses averaged 1.2 percent at the time of the
complaint, 1.8 percent when the administrative law judge ruled and
1.9 percent on final commission action.
   Those cases generate considerably more negative publicity, Oliver
said, compared with ones in which they ``go quietly.''
   By comparison, the FTC study found little effect on businesses
from two other systems of advertising regulation: the National
Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureaus and the Lanham
Act, which allows businesses to sue one another for false
advertising.
   While involvement in any type of false advertising case can
damage a company's reputation, those generated by the FTC tend to
get widespread news media coverage, while the other two systems get
little media attention, the FTC said.
   In the Dream Away case, Nutri Marketing of Scottsdale, Ariz.,
agreed to set up the $1.1 million fund to reimburse buyers of its
Dream Away and Advances Dream Away products.
   Those products consisted of a 21-day supply of pills, sold for
$19.95, which were advertised as a means of losing weight while
sleeping. Dream Away does not cause weight loss without diet or
exercise and does not contribute to the loss effects of diet and
exercise, the commission said.
   Consumers who have purchased Dream Away and who want to determine
if they are eligible for a refund can write Nancy Warder, the
Federal Trade Commission, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C., 20580.

   Jesse Jackson made it clear today that
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis must change his position on
South Africa or face the prospect of a floor fight at the Democratic
National Convention next month.
   Jackson's threat of an embarrassing convention fight comes as
Dukakis closes in on the 2,081 delegates needed to clinch the
nomination, a mark he is certain to reach Tuesday night in the fries.
   Jackson in recent weeks has hinted that he will make a strong
stand at the convention on certain issues, including South Africa.
   He accused Dukakis of proceeding ``rather cautiously and
conservatively'' andinal
four prima said the Massachusetts governor's refusal to
term South Africa a terrorist state ``is a misreading of history.
That's too cautious.''
   ``If he will not bend on that matter, we'll simply meet each
other on the floor in Atlanta,'' he said.
   Jackson insists that South Africa should be declared a terorrist
state, a designation that would subject the racially-divided nation
to severe sanctions.
   Jackson, in a four-state radio news conference, said he plans to
figsse Jackson want? Empowerment for all people in

<TEXT>
   Handwritten notes by an Evan Mecham
campaign aide may be used as evidence in the former governor's
criminal trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, a
judge ruled today.
   However, the three pages of notes by former Mecham Finance
Committee member Vern Gasser may not be introduced as exhibits
unless the defense offers them, the judge said.
   Some contend that the notes, written in fall 1986 by Gasser,
appear to reflect a discussion on whether to disclose the $350,000
campaign loan from developer Barry Wolfson.
   The notes say ``Show Evan borrowed money'' and ``don't show
borrowed money.'
   Gasser testified Friday that he could not recall when the notes
were taken, who was present at the time, or what the notes meant.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan ruled that he
would not allow the notes themselves to be introduced as exhibits
unless the defense requests it ``so the jurors will not place undue
emphasis on them.''
   Ryan noted they were made at meetings that ``dealt with intimate
campaign strategy and finances'' even though Gasser said he could no
longer remember what they meant.
   The prosecution wanted the notes introduced as evidence. But Joe
Keilp, attorney for Mecham's brother and co-defendant, Willard
Mecham, said Friday he was concerned they could be used to imply
that the statements might have been made by Willard Mecham or by
Evan Mecham's former chief of staff, Jim Colter.
   Mecham is charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents. He faces up to 22 years in
prison if convicted on all counts. Willard Mecham, who was his
brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar counts and up
to 9{ years in prison.
   The former governor has long contended that the $350,000 loan was
properly reported as part of a $465,000 lump sum that was listed on
financial reports as a contribution from Mecham.
   The prosecution said in opening statements last week that
Mecham's gubernatorial campaign badly needed the money but wanted to
conceal the fact that it came from a developer because Mecham
portrayed himself as being ``beholden to no one.''
   Mecham, a Republican, took office in January 1987. He was removed
from office April 4 when the Senate convicted him of two unrelated
impeachment counts.
   He also was impeached in connection with the $350,000 loan, but
the Senate decided not to hear that charge to avoid prejudicing his
criminal trial.

<HEAD>Moderate Quake Rattles Southeast Alaska</HEAD>

   A moderate earthquake shook southeastern
Alaska early today, but there were no immediate reports of damage or
injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported.
   The 7:01 a.m. temblor measured 5.2 on the Richter scale and was
centered on the mainland about 80 miles southeast of Yakutat, or 130
miles northwest of Juneau, said George Carte, a warning center
spokesman.
   In Washington, Don Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological
Survey, said earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., recorded the
tremor at a preliminary magnitude of 4.8 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 time
stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause
considerable damage.
   The 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Alaska measured 8.5 on the
Richter scale and was centered in Prince William Sound. It generated
large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed
at least 114 people as far south as Oregon and Hawaii.

<HEAD>Scientists Warn of Severe Climate Changes, Urge Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>

   Climate changes caused by the greenhouse
effect will make deserts hotter and tropical storms more severe in
coming decades and threaten cities with floods from rising seas,
scientists said Monday.
   They urged governments to plan for the trouble and to adopt
policies that will lessen the effects.
   In their report, an international group of scientists urged
curbing coal-fired power stations that emit carbon dioxide, limiting
the use of other gases that create a greenhouse effect in the
atmosphere and coordinating government preparations for weather
changes.
   ``We still don't know the magnitude or rapidity with which the
changes will occur,'' said Bert Bolin, a professor at Stockholm
University, but it is clear that ``climatic problems will be part of
people's lives over the next century.''
   The study was a follow-up to a 1985 conference of the
International Council of Scientific Unions at Villach, Austria,
which endorsed the theory that gases trap energy from the sun near
the earth's surface.
   ``We are entering a new phase. We told the world what scientists
believe will be the case. ... Now nations and politicians must start
to think about the problems,'' said Bolin, who pioneered work on the
greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer.
   Average temperatures will rise by at least 0.54-1.44 degrees
Fahrenheit per decade, and the increase may reach 9 degrees in the
tropics and polar regions, the report said.
   Warmer weather will melt polar ice packs in summer, raising the
sea level by 8-60 inches over the next 50 years, it said.
   At least 30 of the world's largest cities, including New York,
``definitely will be affected,'' said Jill Jaeger of the Beijer
Institute of the Royal Institute of the Academy of Sciences, who
wrote the report.
   Even if emissions of ``greenhouse gases'' were stopped
immediately, those released over the last 100 years would raise the
average temperature by 0.9 degrees and sea levels by 4-4.8 inches,
she said.
   The study was sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization
and the U.N. Environment Program.
   Predicting regional effects of the climate change is difficult,
but the worldwide variance, ``will be considerably larger than has
been known in human history,'' Ms. Jaeger said.
   In two dramatic examples, she said more powerful storms could
cause severe flooding in Bangladesh, threating 50 million people,
and floods could wash over the Nile Basin, where 10 million
Egyptians live.
   ``Roughly half of humanity lives close to the sea,'' she said,
adding that the United States alone will have to spend up to $100
billion to protect its eastern seaboard.
   Among other effects predicted in the report are:
   _Greater evaporation may endanger water supplies.
   _Less rain could threaten farming in some areas while making
agriculture possible in others, leading to population shifts and
probable migration to cities.
   _Warming of ice-bound seas could have military implications in
northern Europe, North America and Siberia: ``If these coastlines
become navigable, fundamental security readjustments will be
required.''
   _Permafrost in northern Canada and Siberia will gradually
disappear.
   _Patterns of fish migration will change, some trees will have
reproduction problems and some animal species will become extinct.
It was not specific about the species involved.
   The report named the ``greenhouse gases'' as carbon dioxide,
methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone.
   It urged limiting emissions of the dangerous gases; development
of alternative energy sources to fossil fuels, including nuclear
energy; an end to deforestation, and planning dikes and other
defenses in areas vulnerable to rising water levels.

   Jesse Jackson today threatened a floor fight at the Democratic
National Convention if he doesn't get his way on declaring South
Africa a terrorist nation. Front-runner Michael Dukakis, meanwhile,
moved closer to the nomination, gaining 37 former Albert Gore
supporters in Kentucky.
   Jackson and Dukakis were both in California today, wrapping up
the long Democratic presidential primary campaign with a final bid
for votes in the state that provides the biggest prize in Tuesday's
four-state finale.
   Vice President George Bush, who locked up his party's nomination
six weeks ago, was also campaigning today in California, with a
series of appearances aimed at calling attention to the drug issue.
   Jackson, in Los Angeles, said that ``California can produce an
upset tomorrow.'' However, in a four-state radio news conference, he
focused more on his goals for the convention next month in Atlanta.
   He made clear that he will press for party adoption of his
position that South Africa is a terrorist state and should be
declared as such by the United States, making it subject to further
sanctions.
   He said Dukakis' own unwillingness to make such a declaration so
far was ``too cautious.'' Jackson added, ``If he will not bend on
that matter, we'll simply meet each other on the floor in Atlanta.''
   Dukakis, at a news conference today, said he had talked with
Jackson Sunday night by telephone and hoped to meet with him soon.
   He didn't say what they would discuss. But when asked about
Jackson's campaign role, Dukakis said, ``If the tables were reversed
and he was on his way to the nomination and I were the runner-up,
I'd expect to be deeply involved. ... I'd try to bring my people
into this. I'd be as serviceable to the ticket as I possibly could.
I'm confident he will be that kind of person.''
   In Kentucky, meanwhile, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson endorsed Dukakis
today and said almost all of the Kentucky delegation to the
convention will follow his lead.
   The switch will mean 37 delegates formerly committed to Tennessee
Sen. Gore have now jumped to the Dukakis camp. As it now stands, all
but six of Kentucky's 67 delegates to the convention will be behind
Dukakis. The others are pledged to Jackson.
   Dukakis is likely to clinch his party's nomination in the final
round of contests Tuesday, which also includes races in New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico. He holds a huge delegate lead over Jackson,
and is fewer than 300 delegates shy of the 2,081 needed to gain the
Democratic nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor, who declared his candidacy 13 months
ago, got off to a shaky start when he finished third in the
season-opening Iowa caucuses in February. But in the months that
followed, he methodically felled a field of rivals, one by one.
   Only Jackson remains an active competitor. And he is making it
clear he will try to remain highly visible even after Tuesday's
races.
   Jackson says his camp will launch a massive voter-registration
drive on Aug. 1. He has said he will keep making appearances after
Tuesday. And he's putting the party on notice there are issues he's
ready to fight for at the convention.
   In addition, some of those around Jackson are taking an
aggressive tack on the subject of the No. 2 spot on the Democratic
ticket. Dukakis has said Jackson deserves to be looked at as a
possible running mate, but deserves no special consideration.
   Jackson's campaign chairman, Willie Brown, said Sunday that
Jackson ought to be offered a spot on the ticket.
   ``I think consideration means literally extending the opportunity
to go on the ticket, and then it will be up to Mr. Jackson to
determine whether or not he wishes to accept it,'' Brown said on
ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Jackson played down the Brown comment, saying: ``That's his point
of view.'' But he told a church congregation Sunday that the
Democratic Party ``must make a commitment to empowerment _ in the
platform, in the party, on the ticket.''
   Telling the congregation in Los Angeles of his intention to push
his agenda at the convention, Jackson used the word ``fight.'' But
he softened that when he spoke to reporters afterward.
   ``Fights come when you fail to negotiate ... when people have
made a decision to go in opposite directions,'' he said.
   Dukakis, as he has been throughout the campaign, was careful to
avoid criticizing Jackson.
   As for Jackson's vow to push to make certain issues part of the
party platform, Dukakis said Sunday: ``I don't see any deep
divisions in the party at all.''
   Dukakis' own aides have indicated he will get out and campaign
prior to the convention to get an early start on the November
contest against Bush. But the vice president can't campaign much
until after the Republican convention, because he has already spent
almost the entire $27 million the law allows for a primary campaign.
   Bush put some distance Sunday between himself and the White House
on the environmentally sensitive issue of offshore oil drilling.
   Campaigning in Los Angeles, the vice president called for a delay
in a controversial drilling project off Northern California _ one
that the Interior Department has been pushing ahead.
   ``Before going forward with new lease sales, we must be assured
that the national treasure of the California coastline will not be
harmed,'' the vice president said.
   Dukakis jabbed at Bush on the subject today, saying, ``I'm
pleased he's coming around, but it's kind of late. I'm not for
delaying that sale. I'm for canceling it.''

   Former Defense Minister V.P. Singh
characterizes his campaign for Parliament in the June 16 elections
as a fight of ``money power versus people's power.''
   His main opponent for the seat from the central city of Allahabad
is singer and scriptwriter Sunil Shastri, who says the race is a
clash of political ideologies.
   Most people, however, see the Singh-Shastri race in Uttar Pardesh
state as a test of strength for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
governing Congress Party.
   It is one of seven by-elections for seats in the lower house of
Parliament. The election will also decide 10 state assembly seats.
   
   A defeat in Uttar Pradesh would signal further weakness for
Gandhi's party, which has fared badly in local contests _ it lost 10
of 14 state assembly elections in the past two years.
   Uttar Pardesh is India's most populous state and a bastion of the
Hindi-speaking population, which dominates India's politics in the
form of the Congress Party.
   Allahabad, a city of 700,000 people, is 350 miles southeast of
New Delhi.
   Sixty-eight other candidates are running for the seat, but the
Congress Party has thrown its weight behind Shastri, 38, the son of
the late popular Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.
   The major national opposition parties have endorsed the
56-year-old Singh, a former Gandhi ally who is now his opponent.
   As defense minister, Singh was one of the most powerful figures
in the Gandhi administration. He broke with the prime minister last
year over the government's hesitation to investigate his allegations
that kickbacks were paid for defense contracts. Some of the funds
were believed to have gone to Gandhi supporters.
   Singh told reporters last week that the central issue of his
campaign remains ``money power versus people's power.'' Singh _
nicknamed ``the raja,'' Hindi for ``the king'' _ is the son of the
late raja of eastern Uttar Pradesh.
   He says he demands a clean government, as well as improved
services such as pure drinking water, adequate electricity supply
and proper irrigation.
   ``I personally see (the race) as a fight between ideologies,''
Shastri said.
   In an interview published in the New Delhi-based Sunday Mail
newspaper, Shastri emphasized that the Congress Party _ through men
like his late father _ had earned the support of the people.
   ``We had great leaders who fought in the freedom struggle (from
Britain in 1947), leaders who took the country on the path of
progress after independence,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Singh-Shastri contest has raised political emotions in the
state to the boiling point.
   Last Friday, Congress Party workers attacked a group of young
people loyal to Singh after they staged a walkout from a Congress
Party meeting. One of the youths was beaten unconscious, and he and
two others required hospitalization.
   The city of Allahabad was shut down by a strike on Saturday to
protest the violence.

   Israel's battle to stop the six-month Arab
uprising is hitting Palestinian and foreign journalists. Reporters
have been arrested, newspapers closed, and sources silenced.
   The Israeli government insists journalists are jailed only for
illegal acts. Palestinians and others say the press is being
punished for reporting the truth and tarnishing Israel's image.
   The army has arrested at least 30 Palestinian journalists since
Dec. 8 and jailed 20 of them for up to six months without charges,
said Marty Rosenbluth of Al Haq, an Arab human rights group based in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
   ``The authorities are trying to restrict any information going
out,'' said Rosenbluth, an American from New York. ``They are
basically trying to block people from finding out what is happening
here.''
   Before the uprising, authorities sometimes briefly closed one or
another of the four Palestinian newspapers in Arab east Jerusalem on
charges of violating military censorship.
   In the past six months, they ordered a six-month closure of the
Palestine Press Service, a news agency serving the foreign press,
and shut down Al Awda, an affiliated weekly published in English and
Arabic.
   During a tour of the Ketziot prison in Israel's Negev Desert,
foreign reporters met six Palestinian journalists who had been
detained without trial.
   Qassem Ali, a free-lance reporter who worked part time for The
Associated Press, said authorities accused him of being politically
active.
   ``But I believe I am here because I am a journalist,'' said Ali,
who had escorted foreign television crews and reporters through Gaza
Strip refugee camps and arranged interviews.
   One recently released detainee is Samaan Khouri, a reporter for
the French news agency Agence France Presse and former editor of the
English-language edition of Al Fajr, a pro-Palestine Liberation
Organization newspaper in Jerusalem.
   Khouri said authorities did not really mind reports of the
uprising reaching the Arab population. But they were worried about
the help Palestinian journalists gave to the foreign press.
   Israeli officials deny the government is trying to muzzle the
press.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said recently: ``Measures have not
been taken against newspapers or journalists because of their
professional activity but because of violations against Israel's
laws.''
   He did not elaborate, and the army refused to explain why it is
holding Arab journalists or how many of them are in jail.
   In covering the uprising, the foreign press often has depended on
Palestinian sources for the first news of violence and for
understanding the Palestinian viewpoint. Part of the reason has been
the army's slowness in issuing reports.
   ``The role of the Palestinian press has been more of a bridge to
the outside world than anything having to do with the intefadeh
(uprising) itself,'' said Khouri, who served 4{ months in Ramle
prison.
   Many of the Arab journalists arrested have escorted foreign
reporters to the occupied territories, arranged interviews and
helped gain details on protests and clashes.
   ``That's why the Israelis closed down the Palestine Press Service
and arrested journalists who have contacts with the foreign press,''
said Khouri. ``They want to cut off these relations.''
   He also attributed his arrest to being on the executive committee
of the Palestine Journalists' Union, representing 160 Arab reporters.
   The group's leader, Rajwan Abu Ayyash, was freed from jail a few
days after Khouri. Government officials said the release followed an
appeal by the Israeli Journalists' Union.
   Amnon Nadav, the union leader, said Jewish journalists have
fought for the release of detained Palestinian reporters since the
beginning of the uprising.
   ``We regard them as professional colleagues and view their
detention as the beginning of a process that could affect us all,''
Nadav said.
   Left-wing Israeli media also are affected by the government's
efforts to control coverage of the uprising.
   In February, the government revoked the printing license of
Derech Nanitzotz, a Communist weekly run by Israeli Jews and printed
in Hebrew and Arabic.
   In May, the government charged four of the paper's editors with
being members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a Moscow-affiliated faction of the PLO.
   Hadas Lahav, a Derech Hanitzotz editor released after 12 days of
police questioning, said the paper's closing and charges against her
colleagues were part of a campaign to silence coverage of the unrest.
   She said the government trumped up charges against her colleagues
to stop them from reporting on the unrest.

<HEAD>Navy Contracts With Dutch Firm For Use Of Heavy-Lift Ship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has awarded a contract to a Dutch firm
to transport the damaged frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts home from the
Persian Gulf aboard a heavy-lift ship, the service said Monday.
   The contract was awarded last week to Wijsmuller Transport of
Ijmuiden, The Netherlands, and totals $1.325 million, said Navy
spokeswoman Marge Holtz.
   It calls for the firm to use its semi-submersible, heavy-lift
ship ``Mighty Servant 2'' to pick up and carry the Roberts from
Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to Bath, Maine, where it is to be
repaired at the Bath Iron Works.
   The guided-missile frigate, which is based at Newport, R.I., was
badly ripped by an underwater mine on April 14 shortly after
completing a convoy operation for a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker. Navy
officials have said the Roberts almost certainly would have sunk had
it not been for the performance of its crew of roughly 200.
   The Navy announced last month it had solicited bids from maritime
operators of heavy-lift ships to carry the Roberts home, saying such
a move would be preferable to performing extensive repairs in Dubai
and then towing it.
   The Mighty Servant 2, one of about two dozen such heavy-lift
ships in operation, measures 558 feet long and 132 feet wide. It is
designed to ``sink'' underneath its cargo and then ``de-ballast'' or
rise up, bringing its cargo out of the water.
   Such ships are used frequently to handle large oil derricks. The
Mighty Servant 2 can cruise at about 14 knots when underway.
   According to the Navy, there is only one such ship in the U.S.
fleet and it is assigned to the Military Sealift Command and
deployed with a war-time readiness force at Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean.
   ``It would be prohibitively expensive to unload that vessel and
there are no other U.S.-flag ships of this type available,'' said
Ms. Holtz. ``That's why we went to a foreign contractor.''
   The spokeswoman declined to discuss the schedule for moving the
Roberts, citing security concerns. Last month, however, the Navy
said it hoped the voyage could begin before the end of June.
   ``With the exception of approximately 10 crewmen who will ride
the heavy-lift ship, the crew of the USS Roberts will fly to their
home port of Newport, R.I., when their ship departs for the United
States,'' the Navy said at the time.

   Organizers of the Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
have declared this year's festival an artistic success although it
will be several weeks before the financial picture comes into focus.
   ``We've done well, but there's still work to be done,'' said
festival General Manager Nigel Redden. ``It happens every year. We
don't know what expenses are going to be exactly, and we will get
unpledged donations, too.''
   The festival closed Sunday night with an open-air symphony
concert of works by Russian composers followed by a fireworks
display at Middleton Place Plantation.
   About 5,000 people attended, some arriving early with picnic
baskets and coolers.
   This year's Spoleto, which critics have hailed as one of the most
ambitious in the festival's 12-year American history, featured more
than 100 performances of opera, music, dance and theater over 17
days.
   ``We're very happy with everything,'' said Charles Way, chairman
of Spoleto's board of directors. ``I have no doubt we'll end up this
year in the black.''
   Festival spokesman Scott Horton said Monday that ticket receipts
are not computerized and it will be several weeks before final
figures on ticket sales are in hand. The festival's fiscal year ends
in August.
   Redden and Way agreed the festival was an artistic success. Way
said the festival was more adventurous than in previous years,
including several premieres.

   A wave of frivolity has overtaken the Jesse
Jackson presidential campaign in the primary season's waning days.
   The sometimes goofy atmosphere, with the candidate in a bouyant,
playful mood, is typified by a series of silly hand signals between
Jackson and the traveling press corps.
   It started when Jackson noticed that reporters were mimicking
what they said was Nancy Reagan's crowd wave _ an outstretched arm
with cupped hand wagged parade-style.
   At the end of a news conference in the Watts ghetto, reporters
gave Jackson the wave. He waved back Nancy-style.
   ``That's how Mrs. Reagan does it,'' Jackson explained to the
bewildered neighborhood onlookers.
   The next day, when reporters were doing what they called a Raisa
Gorbachev wave _ a sternly shaking finger _ Jackson did it, too.
Then he showed off a new signal: four fingers separated in pairs
like Mr. Spock from ``Star Trek.''
   The goofiness continued at almost every campaign stop, Jackson
waving to the press corps from the stage and car. On Friday he
decided to teach a handful of baffled Montana supporters the Spock
sign.
   One woman wanted to know if a simple handshake wouldn't suffice.
   Jackson smiled and kept showing her how to position her fingers.
   As his limousine slowly drove away, all that could be seen was
his arm poking out from the darkened window in a Nancy wave at the
press bus.
   His good mood continued in Bakersfield where he shouldered a
cameraman's boom mike and sound equipment upon returning to his
hotel and mimed the staggering, backward walk that he is accustomed
to seing in front of him.
   He wouldn't relinquish the equipment until the laughing press
corps started shouting ``Action Jackson,'' a slogan that he often
gets his audiences to chant.

<TEXT>
   Back in Los Angeles, before a well-heeled crowd of celebrity
supporters, it was clear that Jackson's standard motivational talk _
the one he uses to give hope to the downtrodden _ wouldn't be quite
appropriate.
   He usually entreats his listeners not to shrink from doing their
best in life, to pursue an education and eschew the downward spiral
of drugs and despair. But that message was not exactly relevant for
this group of successful black entertainers and business people.
   So Jackson tailored the message for them:
   ``As I become president you can head your studio. As I become
president you can be chief surgeon of the hospital.
   ``As I become president you can distribute records, not just sing
on them.
   ``As I become president you can become the president of a bank.
...
   ``We can't just play basketball. We got to own some teams,'' he
said to cheers.
   ``Don't just watch me run,'' he said. ``Run with me.''
   The fund-raiser was hosted by basketball player Norm Nixon and
his wife actress Debbie Allen.

   Larry Konner isn't claiming Jackson is a faith healer. All he
knows is his wife was in a coma, Jackson visited her and prayed over
her, and now she's better.
   Konner's wife Ronnie Wenker-Konner is a Hollywood screenwriter
who suffered a brain hemorrhage last August. She was paralyzed and
in various states of coma for about a month, her husband said.
   He was in the lobbby of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center one day,
feeling very low, when Jackson came walking through with several
aides. He was there to visit the ailing mother of TV star Bill
Cosby, said Konner.
   Konner, whose wife was a big Jackson supporter, had an idea.
   ``I said, `Rev. Jackson, my wife is very ill. She might not make
it. I wonder if you could meet her and say a prayer for her.'''
   As Konner tells it, Jackson went to the room, put his hand on
hers and said `Ronnie, I'm Jesse Jackson.'''
   Then, joining hands with Konner, Jackson's son and a nurse around
the bed, Jackson prayed for the comatose woman at some length and
asked for a miracle to touch her, her husband recalled.
   She opened her eyes, which she had also done the day before, but
did not respond.
   ``He hugged me. I cried and cried in his arms,'' Konner said.
   In the next few days, she began improving and has improved
steadily since, he said. She has regained use of her left side and
most of her right side and is preparing to go back to work, said
Konner.
   Konner says he can't credit Jackson for a miracle, but ``I think
he helped.''

   ``Twinkle, twinkle little star, how we wonder
where you are. Up above the lights you stare, but we can't see you
for their glare. Twinkle, twinkle star so fine, hidden by the city's
shine.''
   So might go the lament of amateur astronomers lobbying officials
to turn down the city lights so they can get a better view of the
heavens.
   The Amateur Astronomers Association of Pittsburgh is seeking
restrictions on street and building lighting to reduce what they
call ``light pollution.'' Artificial light interferes with their
ability to stargaze.
   ``I don't plan on giving up,'' Tom Reiland, association president
and an astronomer at Allegheny Observatory, said recently. ``I feel
this is a worthwhile effort.''
   The dramatic lighting of Fifth Avenue Place, a new skyscraper in
downtown Pittsburgh, was muted after the astronomers complained,
although Hillman Properties Vice President John Markey said the
change came as workers focused the lights, not because of the
astronomers' plea.

   There were a few ``nay'' sayers amid the
worshipers, but that didn't fluster the preachers at the Flint Hills
Rodeo.
   After all, they were on horseback, too.
   Decked out in cowboy hats, boots and shirts, they led an
ecumenical service of hymn singing, scripture reading and
sermonizing Sunday morning for 400 rodeo participants, spectators
and area townsfolk, and, of course, their horses.
   Cheryl Lunday, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in nearby
Cottonwood Falls, read the cowboy's prayer, asking God to guide
those present ``in the arena of life.''
   Bennie Holtsclaw sang ``One Day at a Time'' while sitting astride
his horse strumming a guitar.
   The congregants, many decked out in their Western best, kept
their hats on to ward off the hot sun. Church bells could be heard
ringing in the distance, and there was a collection at the gate.
   The real cowboys at the service included, Bruce Ford, 35, of
Kersey, Colo., a professional bull and bareback bronc rider for 18
years who has won an unprecedented five world championship titles
and four national championships in bareback bronc riding, and, Bart
McBeth, whose specialty is saddle bronc riding.

<HEAD>Train Explosion Prompted Fear of War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panic-stricken victims screamed for help and some
feared nuclear war had broken out when a train explosion flattened
houses and shot flames and a mushroom cloud skyward, Pravda reported
Monday.
   The accident in Arzamas, an industrial city in the Soviet Union's
Volga Valley about 240 miles east of Moscow, occurred Saturday when
three boxcars of a freight train loaded with industrial explosives
blew up.
   Automobiles were tossed in the air and windows were shattered as
far as a mile away, Soviet media said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported the death toll at
73. Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said it might be
impossible to finally determine how many people died in the city of
90,000.
   ``First I saw a high column of flames shoot up. Then I heard a
rumbling, and then a great mushroom cloud rose,'' Pravda quoted a
witness, V. Dormidontov, as saying.
   It quoted one unidentified weeping woman as saying, ``The first
thing that came to my mind was, `Has it started?''' a reference to a
nuclear attack.
   The report on Pravda's back page was the latest in a series of
revealing dispatches about the accident, an apparent sign of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater
openness. Accidents were never reported in such detail before
Gorbachev came to power in March 1985.
   What shocked Arzamas residents, Pravda said, ``was not the
damaged houses or destroyed cars, but the crippled people calling
for help.''
   The death toll likely would mount, the newspaper said, noting
that rescue workers were still searching through rubble.
   ``How is it possible to determine how many people were killed in
cars parked nearby?'' Pravda asked.
   The newspaper noted that an ambulance was destroyed in the blast,
leaving only the wheels behind. ``We know for certain there was a
driver, a nurse and a technician in the ambulance. But were there
any patients?'' Pravda asked.
   The explosion destroyed 150 homes, leaving 600 families homeless,
and severely damaged another 250 buildings, according to Soviet
media.
   A government commission was investigating the causes of the
explosion, the deadliest on Soviet railways this year. The
industrial explosives were intended for use by geologists and
miners, Soviet media said.
   Pravda described the accident scene as being one of ``brief
panic,'' but said medical workers from Moscow and nearby Gorky were
immediately notified and asked for help. Local residents who escaped
injury also rushed to the aid of the victims.

   A countdown test will be conducted
Tuesday in a major rehearsal for the first space shuttle launch
since the Challenger disaster.
   The launch team will assemble in the control center for the final
three hours of a simulated countdown, with a mock liftoff of shuttle
Discovery planned for 9:50 a.m. The exercise will be a realistic
preparation for the actual launch, set for Aug. 31.
   Following the countdown, mission control center in Houston will
assume control of a make-believe flight and will guide a shuttle
crew, operating in a Houston simulator, through an abort situation
in which the astronauts make an emergency landing at Kennedy Space
Center.
   The participating astronauts will be Loren Shriver, James
Wetherbee and Franklin Chang-Diaz. Observing will be the five-man
crew that will fly Discovery, commanded by astronaut Rick Hauck.
   The launch team here has held countdown rehearsals every month
for several months, but Tuesday's test will be the first to tie
together the Kennedy and Johnson space centers, the mission
management team and all the other elements that will be in place on
launch day.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman Lisa
Malone said the practice ``will validate to the fullest extent
possible the complete launch process system.'' She said it will
exercise procedure and personnel changes that have occurred since
the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986,
killing the crew of seven.
   Discovery is in a hangar at Kennedy Space Center, undergoing
final checks following a major overhaul of systems. Many of the
changes were the result of the investigation into the Challenger
accident, which was blamed on a faulty joint in a solid fuel booster
rocket.
   On June 16, Discovery is to be moved into an assembly building
for mating with its two solid fuel boosters and external fuel tank.
Transfer to the launch pad is planned for June 27.
   The spaceship's three main engines will be test-fired on the pad
in a critical test July 19.
   Officials said the current Aug. 31 launch target can be met if no
critical problems crop up during testing here and at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah, where two more full-scale tests are planned
of the redesigned booster rocket. The Utah tests are slated for June
14 and July 26.

<TEXT>
   The military said Monday it is
considering mobilizing special reserve units to help counter
deployment of Cuban forces in southern Angola.
   The brief statement from military headquarters in Pretoria
confirmed newspaper reports that a call-up was possible as a
precautionary measure in the event of escalated combat.
   The mobilization would involve units of the Citizen Force, which
includes men who have completed their obligatory two-year military
service but who participate in annual training camps and may be
mobilized.
   South African troops fighting in Angola support the rebels
fighting Angola's Marxist government. Angolan troops are backed by
an estimated 45,000 Cuban soldiers.
   South African officials have warned that the Cuban buildup _
confirmed by Cuban President Fidel Castro _ could jeopardize peace
negotiations aimed at resolving Angola's 13-year-old civil war.
   South Africa has said 9,000 to 15,000 new Cuban troops are
involved in the latest deployment.
   The peace talks also are aimed at bringing independence to
South-West Africa, the South African-ruled territory commonly known
as Namibia, which borders southern Angola.
   South Africa has complained that the Cubans, in some cases
accompanied by Namibian guerrillas, have moved to within 25 miles of
the Namibian border.
   South African military officials said Namibian guerrillas have
used the protection of the additional Cuban troops to move their
bases closer to the Angolan border and away from South African
troops on raids in Namibia.
   South Africa has 97,000 soldiers on active duty and about 175,000
reservists in the Citizen Force, according to the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In sharp contrast to the media assaults of
February and March, the California airwaves are nearly devoid of
presidential advertising as the primary season draws to its
anticlimactic close
   With the Democratic and Republican nominees all but chosen, only
underdog Jesse Jackson waged a substantial television campaign in
the state with the largest number of convention delegates at stake.
He was hoping to spend $700,000 on TV by the time the polls closed
in California, one of four states with primaries on Tuesday.
   Republican Vice President George Bush, nearing the $27 million
ceiling on primary spending, didn't advertise at all. And
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the probable Democratic nominee,
expected to spend no more than $200,000 on television.
   ``Realistically, you have to spend far more than we anticipate
spending to maximize the impact of advertising,'' said Dukakis
strategist Tom Kiley. ``His own schedule of appearances was the
thing in which we were investing most heavily, the most important
element of the campaign.''
   Alixe Glen, a Bush spokeswoman, said Bush stayed off the air in
California ``in large part due to the fact that we have not had an
opponent for so long in the Republican Party.''
   Dukakis limited his television advertising to Los Angeles and San
Francisco. The idea, according to Kiley, was to catch the attention
of people already interested in the election and give them a little
extra information about Dukakis.
   ``That's a very modest goal,'' Kiley said. ``We don't pretend
that advertising is playing a major role in the campaign.''
   The early part of the primary season, with its multitude of GOP
and Democratic candidates, was rife with hard-hitting, often
negative television advertising. The TV campaign culminated on Super
Tuesday, March 8, when the presidential hopefuls competed in 20
far-flung contests in what, for many of them, was a do-or-die
proposition.
   By the time the final four primaries rolled around, the focus was
already on the general election in November.
   In one California ad, Dukakis says ``the chief executive can make
a difference in the war against drugs. I've done it in my state and
I want to do it for every state in this country.''
   In a companion ad, an announcer describes Dukakis' Massachusetts
program and quotes federal agents as calling it ``a model for the
nation. ... He did it with hard work. Integrity. Leadership. We
could use some of that in the White House.''
   Dukakis also was using a biographical spot and radio ads, some in
Spanish, aimed at the state's black and Hispanic voters.
   Jackson, his dream of a California upset all but dead, made a
last-minute pitch for money in a 30-second ad that started running
Saturday. And he bought a half-hour of television time across the
state Monday night to wind up his all-out drive in California.
   The program, part live and part pre-recorded, was meant to
highlight the significance and achievements of the Jackson campaign,
raise money and attract as many voters as possible. Actor Tony
Franciosa, who played the teacher ``Mr. Novak'' on television years
ago, signed on as the moderator.
   In the days preceding the primary, Jackson used an array of
30-second ads, some old and some new, on cable, independent and
network affiliate stations in Fresno, Los Angeles, El Centro,
Sacramento, Salinas, Redding, Santa Barbara, Bakersfield, Palm
Springs, San Jose, San Francisco, Eureka, Monterey, San Diego, and
Reno, Nev.
   One older ad touted Jackson's success in winning the release of
an American pilot shot down in the Middle East. Other spots featured
farmers saying they need Jackson and actress Eileen Brennan praising
the candidate's stands on women's issues.

   The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul,
Minn., have been selected to host the 1991 International Summer
Special Olympic Games _ an event organizers say will be that year's
largest sports event.
   ``These games will be historic in that there will be more people
with mental retardation competing and more countries sending
athletes than ever before,'' Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder and
chairman of the Special Olympics International, said Monday.
   The budget for the 1991 games is estimated to be approximately $8
million, $3 million more than that of the 1987 international
competition held in South Bend, Ind.
   Budget expenditures include transportation, housing, food,
security, facility preparation, equipment, special events for the
athletes and opening and closing ceremonies.
   Mrs. Shriver said the committee, which has to raise the bulk of
the budget, expects the participation of more than 6,000 special
olympians from 91 nations.
   Founded in 1968, the Special Olympics International provides
year-round sports training and competition to 1 million disabled
athletes in more than 70 countries.

   Identical twins Jerlyn and Jeanine Jones
think alike _so much alike that they wound up with the same
grade-point average to share top-of-the-class honors on graduating
from eighth grade.
   The 14-year-olds each scored 1.16 under a grading system in which
an A is 1, a B is 2, etc., said Bush Elementary School Principal
Eddie Lewis. The lower the average, the better the grades.
   The two girls had identical class schedules, and expect to
continue sharing classes in high school and attend the same college
later on.
   And the similarity doesn't end with academics. Jeanine is student
council president, Jerlyn vice president, and they also participated
in the same sports.
   In discussing their lives, one twin often finishes a sentence
begun by the other, without interruption or hesitation.
   ``A lot of times we say the same thing at the same time,''
Jeanine said. ``And our friends get frustrated when we do that,''
her sister added.
   ``Our teachers can't tell us apart,'' Jerlyn said. ``They just
take a guess,'' Jeanine said.
   At their graduation Wednesday, one intends to talk about their
past education, the other about the future.
   As for how they achieved the honor, Jerlyn said, ``I just go to
my classes, stick to my work, study _ it just comes naturally.''
   ``Our mother makes sure we do our homework,'' Jeanine added.

<HEAD>Lawyers For Anne Henderson-Pollard Ask For Sentence Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the wife of convicted spy Jonathan
Jay Pollard filed a motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals on Monday
asking for reduction of her five-year prison sentence due to
deteriorating health.
   The brief seeks to overturn last December's ruling by District
Judge Aubrey Robinson, who rejected a request by Anne
Henderson-Pollard for a sentence reduction.
   Nathan Dershowitz, the attorney representing Mrs.
Henderson-Pollard, said he had asked the court either to reduce the
sentence to the time already served, to suspend her remaining
sentence or to grant her probation.
   Mrs. Henderson-Pollard was sentenced to five years imprisonment
for conspiring to receive embezzled government property and being an
accessory after the fact to possession of defense secrets. She began
serving her sentence on March 4, 1987, the same day her husband
began serving a life term.
   Pollard, a civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy, was
found guilty of selling secrets to Israel.
   Mrs. Henderson-Pollard suffers from a rare stomach ailment, and
friends and relatives say she has lost some 60 pounds in the past
two years. She is currently at the Federal Correctional Institution
in Rochester, Minnesota, to undergo testing at the nearby Mayo
Clinic.
   The court brief contends that Mrs. Henderson-Pollard is being
denied proper medical treatment at the Lexington, Ky. jail where she
is usually incarcerated.
   ``This barbarous withdrawal of treatment forced Mrs. Pollard to
endure excruciating pain, without even the limited relief afforded
by painkilling medication,'' the brief said.
   Her father, Bernard Henderson, visited Mrs. Pollard 10 days ago.
He said her condition was ``similar to survivors of death camps. She
is permanently hunched over in pain, cannot stand or sit erect, and
is little but skin and bones.''

   Firefighters have been known to rescue cats
from trees, so a caller to the town's emergency communications
center figured it was the logical place to turn for a man up a tree.
   Still, the dispatchers at first weren't sure they heard right,
said Tina Como.
   ``They said, `Do you get cats out of trees?' And we said, `No.'
Then they asked, `Do you get people out of trees?'''
   According to the dispatcher, a man apparently climbed a tall tree
Saturday afternoon and was afraid to get down, so somebody phoned
for help.
   ``I assume he was getting his cat out of the tree,'' Ms. Como
said. After she and other dispatchers got over what she described as
``a case of the giggles,'' they dispatched the Cary Rescue Squad and
the Cary Volunteer Fire Department.
   ``We figured you'd get a man out of the tree the same way you'd
get a cat out of a tree _ put a bowl of food out and wait for him to
come down,'' she said.
   After the caller phoned back to report the man had gotten down by
himself, the dispatchers recalled the firefighters.
   ``I guess he heard those sirens and decided he didn't want to be
embarrassed,'' Ms. Como said. ``He probably let go.''

<TEXT>
   When Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson comes to
the nation's capital he often stays at the vice president's mansion,
the guest of his friend George Bush.
   This summer, Bush could offer Thompson a chance to become a
longer-term resident of the house on the Naval Observatory grounds.
   Now in his fourth term as governor, Thompson often is mentioned
as a potential choice to be the vice presidential nominee on a
Republican ticket headed by Bush.
   As governor of a major battleground state in the fall election _
one that offers 24 electoral votes _ Thompson's name would almost
certainly turn up on most short lists of GOP vice presidential
prospects. Another plus is his closeness to Bush.
   But Thompson, who was elected governor of Illinois in 1976 by the
largest margin in state history, has been on the lists of other
Republican presidential hopefuls and never has gotten beyond being
one of those mentioned.
   One reason is that he is one of the last of the liberal
Republicans, a dwindling band of politicians in the ideological mold
of the late Nelson A. Rockefeller, politicians left out in the cold
in the GOP of the Ronald Reagan era.
   Thompson earned the enmity of Reagan loyalists in 1980 when he
waited until May 4 to endorse the former California governor for the
GOP presidential nomination. His endorsement came six weeks after
the Illinois primary and after all chance of any other Republican
overtaking Reagan had been lost.
   Also open to question is whether Thompson could guarantee the
Republican ticket would carry Illinois. While the 52-year-old
governor's 1.4-million-vote victory margin in 1976 was the largest
in state history, he also squeeked through to re-election in 1982 by
5,074 votes _ the smallest edge ever.
   In that race, Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson III didn't concede
defeat until two months after Election Day, when the state Supreme
Court rejected his request for a statewide recount.
   Thompson was considered vulnerable as he squared off for a
rematch against Stevenson in 1986.
   Stevenson's chances suffered a fatal blow on primary day when a
follower of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche won nomination as
lieutenant governor. Stevenson resigned as the Democratic nominee
for governor and ran at the head of an independent slate. The
confusion effectively doomed his chances to mount another strong
challenge to Thompson.
   But even with the chaos on the Democratic side, Thompson was
re-elected by fewer than 400,000 votes out of 3.1 million.
   The 6-foot-6 Thompson served four years as U.S. attorney in the
early 1970s and earned a reputation as a crusader against corruption
and as a man intolerant of even the appearance of impropriety by
government officials.
   It was with that reputation that he swept into office in 1976 for
a two-year term. In 1978, he easily won re-election for the first
four-year term.
   A native of Chicago, Thompson is a graduate of Northwestern
University Law School. His wife Jayne also is a lawyer.

   At least 10 people have died in two days
of Gurkha separatist violence in the Darjeeling district of West
Bengal state, the Press Trust of India reported Monday.
   Darjeeling, a region in the Himalayas known for tourism and tea,
is about 185 miles north of Calcutta.
   The violence has been blamed on the Gurkha National Liberation
Front, which has been agitating for an independent state since April
1986.
   Gurkhas, who are Indians of Nepalese descent, say they are
ignored by the leftist government that controls West Bengal state
and that the federal government has not provided adequate education
and development aid.
   More than 275 deaths have been reported since the Gurkha
insurgency began.

   About 9,000 Toycraft stuffed bears are being
recalled because their eyes and nose could come off and pose a
choking hazard for children, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced Monday.
   One child died of asphyxiation after the plastic nose from one of
the bears became lodged in her larynx, the commission reported.
   The recall covers stuffed bears with labels identifying the maker
as ``Toycraft Industries Inc., Brooklyn, N.Y.'' and stating
``Stuffed Toys for Tots and Teens.''
   The bears are 26 inches tall, nine inches across the chest and
come in assorted colors. They sold for about $6.
   The commission urged parents to take the bears from children and
return them to the store where purchased for a full refund.

   A four-member U.S. team left Bangkok for
Hanoi on Monday for a four-day visit to discuss humanitarian
concerns with officials there, an American official said.
   Ross Petzing, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said the
team included orthopedic specialist Dr. Bruce E. Van Damm of the
U.S. Army's Walter Reed Medical Center; Perry W. Stafford of
Bethesda Naval Hospital; Neil A. Holtzman of Johns Hopkins
University and Laurence Kerr, the Vietnam desk officer from the U.S.
State Department.
   The team returns to Bangkok on Thursday.
   Since last August, the U.S. government has dispatched medical
teams to Vietnam on four occasions to explore the needs of disabled
war veterans and others. Vietnam in turn pledged to speed up efforts
to account for Americans missing in the Vietnam War.
   Two American surgeons visited the communist nation from March
22-April 1 as part of an agreement between Hanoi's Maxillo-Facial
Institute and the private U.S. Committee for Scientific and
Technical Cooperation with Vietnam.
   The U.S. government has provided no direct humanitarian aid to
Vietnam but has allowed a private shipment of prosthetic devices.
The two countries have no diplomatic relations but over the past
year, the visits by U.S. officials have increased substantially.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $58 million construction project at the
Franklin Institute and Science Museum has been halted until
archaeologists can see if the excavation site holds any historical
artifacts, officials said Monday.
   Excavation was halted Sunday after cultural officials and
archaeologists criticized the Franklin Institute for not conducting
an archaeological survey before construction began.
   ``We'll try to get people over as soon as we can,'' said Donald
A. Cooke, the institute's vice president for marketing, fund-raising
and communication.
   Crews had been digging a block-long 12-foot-deep hole for a $58
million addition to the institute that will house a future's center,
which will look at science and technology that is shaping the 21st
century, said Cooke.
   Cooke said he didn't know how the excavation halt would affect
construction deadlines or how much money it would cost the museum.
``It certainly will cost us a little bit of time and a little bit of
money,'' he said. ``We think it's worth doing.''
   The excavation is in a small portion of a five-block area that
was once was the site of the Magdalen Society, a Quaker society for
reforming prostitutes that operated for more than 100 years.
   Cooke said excavation in the last 10 to 30 years by the institute
could have possibly already destroyed historical material. Among
other things, deep supports were built for a Boeing 707 it had on
display.
   However, John L. Cotter, formerly the chief archaeologist for the
National Park Service's eastern region, disagreed.
   ``Heavens, you can have all sorts of pillars and destroy half the
site, but the point is that you still have the areas where there are
no pillars and you have the other half of the site,'' Cotter said.
   Although the museum received $10 million in state money, state
officials said the usual requirement for an archaeological review
did not apply because the money was granted directly from the
Legislature, instead of through a state agency.
   Cooke said no one requested an archaeological review.
   Cooke said museum officials intend to meet with the Philadelphia
Historical Commission on Wednesday and hope to develop a plan to
review the site.

<HEAD>Record Federal Cash Payoff of $1.35 Billion at Two Failed
California S&Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Monday ordered payment of
a record $1.35 billion to depositors in two insolvent savings
institutions in California.
   In rare move, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed American
Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan
Association, both of Costa Mesa, without arranging for a takeover by
another institution.
   Only 10 of 235 failed S&Ls handled since 1981 have been resolved
with a straight payoff of depositors. Usually, the bank board pays a
bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick S&L because it is cheaper.
At the very least, the board arranges to transfer deposits to
another institution.
   But bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the unique
characteristics of the two Costa Mesa thrifts made that impractical.
They had little value as going concerns because they had few retail
deposits and lacked branch offices, he said.
   Both also relied on high-cost, short-term deposits arranged
through brokers, which they in turn lent out for speculative real
estate ventures and other risky investments.
   Both institutions have been insolvent for some time. Regulators
took over the management of American Diversified in February 1986
and of North America in January 1987.
   The bank board is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. to American Diversified depositors in what
Wall said was the largest cash payout his agency has made. It is
covering $209 million in deposits at North America.
   Deposits up to the insurance limit of $100,000 will be available
beginning Tuesday. A total of about $500,000 in both institutions
exceeded the limit. Those depositors will share in liquidation
proceeds.
   ``These two represented abuses,'' bank board member Lawrence
White said in an interview. ``The whole essence of being a
depository institution with governement-provided insurance is that
there is a strong ... obligation to operate in a safe and sound
manner. These two places did not.''
   Prior to American Diversified, the largest cash payout was $300
million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite,
Texas.
   However, in transactions over the last year the bank board has
bailed out insolvent institutions for as much as $2 billion, with
most of the assistance coming in the form of notes or guarantees
against certain kinds of future loss, not cash.
   The bank board expects to recover about $400 million from the
sale of the Costa Mesa S&Ls' assets. It estimates the ultimate cost
of closing American Diversified at $798 million and of North America
at $133 million.
   The closing of the California associations leaves the insurance
fund with about $1.9 billion in cash to handle problems elsewhere,
including the Southwest, where a downturn in the oil industry has
pushed many thrifts into insolvency. However, it has the power to
borrow money if necessary and is expecting $465 million in insurance
premiums from healthy S&Ls this month.
   Regulators have said they will have about $20 billion over three
years, more than enough to resolve the cases of the 200 worst S&Ls.
   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing wing,
puts the cost of cleaning up all 500 insolvent S&Ls between $26
billion and $36 billion and says Congress may have to come up with
more money for the fund. Private analysts put the pricetag at more
than $50 billion.
   Wall said closing the two California thrifts will help all S&Ls
by reducing pressure to pay high interest rates. Failing thrifts had
to pay high rates to get the cash needed to meet expenses and some
healthy thrifts have had to raise their rates to compete.
   North America was paying 8.53 percent interest on deposits, 1.45
percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions.
American Diversified was paying 8.64 percent.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
said the two Costa Mesa S&Ls were prime examples of ``several
score'' high-flying institutions that in the early and mid-1980s
used federally guaranteed deposits to fuel rapid growth of shaky
lending. Regulators were unprepared for the boom and failed to check
it, he said.
   ``It was a systemic breakdown. What we are seeing are two of the
more extreme examples of it. But they're not the only ones out
there. There are others,'' Ely said.
   American Diversified's assets ballooned from $11 million in
mid-1983 to $792 million at the end of 1984. But most of the assets
were undocumented and unsecured loans for real estate and technology
ventures, the bank board said.
   As of March 31, American Diversified had $509 million in assets
and $1.12 billion in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $8.3
million a month, and 77 percent of its loans were bad.
   North America had $98.2 million in assets and $215.7 million in
liabilities at the end of March. It was losing an estimated $1.59
million a month, and 98 percent of its borrowers weren't making
payments.

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case said Monday
the danger of exposing the nation's most sensitive secrets posed a
serious obstacle to pressing the conspiracy charges against Oliver
L. North and three co-defendants.
   This was the second time in the past two weeks that U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell warned that unprecedented legal problems in
the case could curtail the rights of defendants to defend themselves
against the conspiracy charges.
   ``What's causing the trouble here is the conspiracy counts,
because they related to a wide course of conduct,'' Gesell told a
hearing in which the defense said the classified information
problems were insurmountable.
   Gesell, who did not decide whether to retain the conspiracy
charges, which allege the defendants defrauded the government, said
nonetheless that the exposure problem could inhibit defendants'
ability to show that they acted no differently than in other covert
operations.
   ``When a man is accused, he ought to be able to get on the stand
and tell his side of the story, if he wants to,'' the judge said.
   But that right could be restricted, Gesell said, if a defendant
wants to point to other secret operations and say, ``I've been doing
these things time and time again in other covert operations with the
approval of Cabinet officials.''
   The judge suggested that the prosecution might be better off
tying counts other than conspiracy, such as obstruction of Congress,
making false statements to Congress, obstruction of a presidential
inquiry, falsifying documents, conspiracy to pay illegal gratuities
and obstruction of justice.
   On another issue, Gesell rejected a defense pre-trial request for
top-secret documents. On Friday, the CIA's top lawyer filed a
statement contending that some of the documents are so sensitive,
that only President Reagan, the director of central intelligence and
his deputy are allowed to see them.
   On May 26, Gesell said a trial on the conspiracy charges could be
impossible because defendants might not have the usual trial
privilege of confronting each other on prior statements.
   Such questioning might be curtailed because three of the four
defendants testified before Congress under a grant of limited
immunity from prosecution _ testimony that the prosecution can't
use, and that might also be inadmissible under the defense case.
   The judge and lawyers for both sides agree that no prior case had
to deal with such extensive immunized testimony or up to 200,000
pages of classified documents.
   A federal grand jury last March handed down a 23-count indictment
against North, a former National Security Council staffer; his
onetime boss, former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter;
and two businessmen, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord
and Albert Hakim.
   The first count charges all four defendants with conspiracy to
defraud the government by using profits from a presidentially
approved sale of arms to Iran for personal gain, and to aid the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance was banned by law.
   Gesell revealed at Monday's hearing that Secord, before he gave
congressional testimony, provided prosecutors with leads in the
case. Secord ended up meeting with the prosecution staff nearly a
dozen times before his indictment, Gesell said.
   The judge said he was surprised that none of the lawyers had
mentioned that Secord had helped the prosecution _ a fact Gesell
said he learned from a footnote in a legal brief.
   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, said the retired general acted out
of a ``sense of obligation and duty,'' and believed ``if he were to
tell the truth,'' prosecutors and members of Congress would
``ultimately agree'' he did nothing wrong.
   Gesell denied motions by Secord and Hakim to dismiss the
indictments against them. Both defendants charged that the
prosecution refused to allow the grand jury to hear North's and
Poindexter's immunized testimony _ which Secord and Hakim contended
would have proved that the money raised from the Iran arms sales
belonged to their business enterprise, not the government.
   North lawyer Barry Simon told Gesell the trial would have to stop
every time a witness was about to refer to classified information so
the court could decide how to proceed.
   ``The potential is absolutely endless,'' Simon said.
   But independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh argued, ``The
defendants are greatly exaggerating the problem,'' and called the
conspiracy count ``really vital as a unifying function in the
indictment.''
   He said much of the difficulty would be solved by substituting
letters and numbers for specific countries and individuals, a system
used at the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.
   Gesell said the prolem was broader, because of the potential need
to describe other covert operations.
   Testimony about these operations could be prohibited under the
Classified Information Procedures Act if U.S. intelligence agencies
were unwilling to expose the information in court.

   A leak of diesel fuel from a dredge
that sank in the St. Marys River channel slowed Monday, the Coast
Guard said, and no damage to wildlife had been reported.
   The Coast Guard was still working to reopen the channel to ships,
including Navy submarines based at nearby St. Marys, Ga. The dredge
sank in high wind and heavy seas Saturday.
   A bird expert said the leaking fuel threatened nearby marshes and
wetlands, including the Cumberland Island National Seashore. The
area has nesting sites of many species, some of which are now
raising their young.
   However, Coast Guard Cmdr. Henry Rohrs, executive officer of the
Marine Safety Office, said it appeared the fuel was not threatening
the sensitive areas.
   ``Less diesel is coming out than during the last few days,''
Rohrs said. ``It appears to be evaporating and blowing away. We did
a beach survey and found nothing, no pocketing of oil on the water
or sand, just a sheen.''
   Rohrs said the rate of leakage from the dredge Crest, which was
carrying 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel, had fallen from 500 gallons
an hour earlier to an estimated 100 gallons.
   Cindy Mosling, founder and director of Bird Emergency and Kare
Sanctuary, known as BEAKS, said she hasn't heard of any bird
injuries caused by the diesel fuel.
   But, she said, ``We have nesting birds in the marshes and this
could be very destructive. There are nesting colonies in very
critical areas. They use that whole area to dive and hunt for food.''
   Coast Guard officials said they wanted to set up a temporary
one-way-at-a-time boat channel around the dredge while divers
attempt to plug the leak.
   ``We are hoping to get private divers down there to plug the
vents, but the weather has not allowed them to do that,'' Rohrs
said. ``It's been too rough.''
   The closing of the channel has had ``no effect on commercial
traffic, since none was due in until (Tuesday),'' Rohrs said. ``Of
course, the Navy is very concerned.''
   Rohrs said officials were still investigating the sinking.
Because the dredge company took full responsibility for the cleanup,
the Coast Guard was only monitoring the situation and had not had to
spend any federal funds on removing oil, Rohrs said.

students were arrested while trying to leave for a rally near the
border with North Korea.
   After Park Rae-chun's death was reported, about 1,000 students
assembled outside Seoul's Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital, shouting
``Yankee go home!'' Park had been hospitalized there since his
self-immolation Saturday.
   Students formed a committee and decided to hold a ``democratic
people's funeral'' for the 24-year-old junior from Soongshil
University. The burial site was not announced.
   At one point Monday, about 500 of the students outside the
hospital shouted slogans against the government and the United
States. Police did not intervene.
   Other police rounded up 20 dissident students at a Seoul bus
terminal and 128 students at the Munsan railway station 25 miles
north of the capital, officials said.
   The students from Seoul National and Yonsei universities were en
route to the south bank of the Imjin River near the border to attend
a prayer rally for national reunification.
   About 2,000 police were on the highway between Seoul and the
river and set up several checkpoints in the effort to keep radical
students away from the river, the northernmost point to which South
Koreans are permitted to travel. The demilitarized zone between the
Koreas is several miles to the north.
   Police turned away scores of students who tried to board trains
at several railway stations in Seoul.
   The government banned the riverside rally, which the students
intended as as a warm-up for a proposed North-South meeting of
student leaders in the Panmunjom border village Friday to discuss
reunficiation and a joint Olympics.
   North Korea says it will boycott the games scheduled for
September in Seoul because its demand to be co-host was rejected.
   Radical students in the South say making South Korea the only
host will perpetuate partition of the peninsula, which has been
divided since 1945.
   President Roh Tae-woo's government has forbidden the North-South
student meeting and says anyone disobeying the order will be
arrested. The planned march to Panmunjom is considered a serious
challenge to the government position that it should be the sole
channel for contact with North Korea.
   Officials say the student talks would harm the national interest
and give the North a propaganda advantage.
   On Saturday, four students were arrested while trying to force
their way through the main gate of U.S. Army headquarters in Seoul
to seek permission from Gen. Louis Menetrey, the American commander,
for the march to Panmunjon.
   The U.N. Command, led by the United States and its Korean war
allies, controls the southern half of the truce village and North
Korea controls the northern half.
   A U.S. military spokesman told them only the South Korean
government could grant permission. The four were among 13
representatives chosen by radical student leaders Saturday to
represent the south at the meeting with students from the North.
   They and another student were charged Monday with violating the
National Security Law. Police said they were looking for the other
delegates to the Panmunjom meeting and about 30 other students
suspected of organizing it.
   Young radicals recently have adopted a strong anti-American tone,
claiming the 42,000 American troops in South Korea delay
reunification and demanding they be withdrawn. The soldiers are here
under a mutual defense pact the governments have maintained since
the Korean war of 1950-53.

<HEAD>Historic Ferry to be Refloated off Ellis Island</HEAD>

   Work begins Tuesday on refloating the ferry Ellis
Island, which carried 12 million immigrants to Manhattan and New
Jersey but now is a hazard.
   ``Our principal concern is that the structure is a navigational
hazard and we have to move it because of that,'' Edie Shean-Hammond,
a spokeswoman for the National Park Service, said Monday from her
office in Boston.
   Although the vessel has been a hazard since it sank in 1968, the
Park Service is opening a museum on Ellis Island next year and the
channel must be dredged for newer ferries, Mrs. Shean-Hammond said.
   The ferry, sitting in New York Harbor, also has historical
significance. Once raised, it will be taken to another part of the
island and studied, Mrs. Shean-Hammond said.
   ``It was the ride to freedom for them. It was their hope for the
future for them,'' she said.
   When the project was proposed, private contractors bidding for
the salvage offered costly estimates for what they said might be an
impossible job _ raising the vessel in one piece. But the U.S. Navy
is going to do the job free.
   On Tuesday, a Naval Reserve unit from Chicago will arrive and
begin setting up for an initial dive Wednesday. The divers will work
through June 16 removing silt and patching a few small holes in the
hull. Other reserve units will work through the summer.
   The double-decked ferry began service in 1904 for what was then
the Bureau of Immigration. The 160-foot long vessel could carry
1,000 immigrants in its hold and about 25 officials and New York
visitors on the top. It was outfitted with a 12-bed hospital.
   It made its last run in 1954 and was docked at Ellis Island until
it sank on Aug. 11, 1968, after years of sitting in the water
without attention.

   An assistance program designed to bring
telephone service to poor Americans signed up nearly 14,000 new
subscribers in four target areas in the first six months of the
program, though a government report shows phone subscribership in
three of those areas declined overall.
   The program, called ``Link Up America,'' is a combined initiative
of state and federal regulators, consumer groups and telephone
companies to bring phone service to the 5 million Americans who
don't have it.
   Since it was started last October, 30 states and the District of
Columbia have developed programs certified by the Federal
Communications Commission. Residents of those states become eligible
for benefits that include payment of up to half of their phone
installation and connection charges, up to $30.
   The District of Columbia and three states _ Arkansas, Texas and
West Virginia _ were selected as target states to be monitored
closely for six months so the FCC could assess the effectiveness of
various marketing strategies that could be used in other areas.
   Link Up America officials say the program signed up 5,358 new
subscribers in Arkansas, 455 in the District of Columbia, 5,153 in
Texas and 3,029 in West Virginia.
   A Census Bureau survey for the FCC shows that subscribership
declined from March 1987 to March 1988 in Arkansas, from 87 percent
to 83.6 percent of the population; in Texas, from 90.4 percent to
87.8 percent; and in West Virginia, from 88.7 percent to 87.9
percent. In Washington, D.C., subscribership rose from 91.2 percent
to 93.3 percent.
   FCC spokesman John Kamp said economic conditions in the three
states probably accounted for the overall decline in subscribership.
   ``These three states are economically in bad shape. That even
with this program the penetration would go down is not too
surprising to us,'' he said.

   A Central American airlines jet took off from
a World War II auxiliary landing strip Monday and completed the
final 12 miles of a trip cut short two weeks ago by engine failure
and an emergency landing in a thunderstorm.
   The Boeing 737 landed successfully without power May 24, without
injuries to the 41 people aboard.
   Monday's takeoff was normal ``in all respects,'' said Warren V.
Wandel, a safety inspector for the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   Actually, the fast, steep ascent would have been a bit
uncomfortable for passengers, had there been any aboard.
   The two Boeing test pilots who flew the plane from its emergency
landing strip to New Orleans International Airport practically stood
the plane on its tail, made a 15-degree turn to the right and
climbed quickly into low clouds lingering from two days of rain.
   The plane landed safely at New Orleans International about 15
minutes later.
   The narrow World War II airstrip is now used as a road from a
fuel tank assembly plant to a harbor on the Intracoastal Waterway, a
straight-line shortcut from the Gulf of Mexico to the port at New
Orleans.
   The May 24 emergency landing was made on a grassy strip parallel
to the road.
   The plane had lost power in both engines, and the right one,
which showed some damage from overheating, was replaced for takeoff.
Wandel said the left engine would be removed at New Orleans
International, and both engines would be taken apart next week and
inspected.
   Of all the possible causes of the loss of power, only fuel
contamination has been ruled out, Wandel said. It will be several
months before the NTSB announces its findings, he said.
   Getting approval to remove the plane from the insurers and all
the federal, state and local agencies involved was cumbersome. There
were discussions of taking the plane apart and trucking the pieces
away as well as putting it aboard a barge and floating it to an
airport.
   It is owned by TACA, a Central American airline based in El
Salvador with offices in New Orleans.

   Three lions broke through a wooden
fence during a circus in southeastern Brazil and mauled to death two
young children, police said Monday.
   The accident happened during a performance Saturday of the
Hungaro Circus in the town of Colonel Fabriciano, 335 miles
northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
   Osman Canela, the police chief, said 2-year-old Maira da Silva
and her 5-year-old sister, Marina, were sitting in the front row of
the wooden bleachers when the lions broke from their trainer and
burst through the fence separating the ring from the stands.
   One lion grabbed Maira by the head and a second mauled Marina, he
said.
   A circus performer managed to capture a third lion, Canela said.
   Marina was killed instantly, and Maira died when she arrived at
the hospital, according to Rio's Jornal do Brasil newspaper.
   The girls had gone to the show with their aunt and uncle, who
were both injured trying to save their nieces, according to the
newspapers. The couple's own two children were not injured in the
attack.
   Canela said the circus owners would be charged in connection with
the deaths.

<HEAD>Report Says Cigarette Lighter Flame May Have Sparked Mine Disaster</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor on Monday promised a
full probe of the Borken mine explosion, and a national television
network said he was looking into whether a flame from a cigarette
lighter sparked the disaster.
   Rescue workers early Monday found the body of another miner,
bringing the number of confirmed dead to 46.
   Mine owners again defended the rescue operation following the
disclosure that radio contact was made with six miners hours after
the blast but then cut off when a radio operator told them to stop
sending signals.
   The owners of the mine acknowledged Sunday that a radio operator
told the six miners to stop sending messages, believing they were
another search team.
   Heinz Cramer, a technical director for Preussen Elekta, the
company that owns the mine, said Monday that failure to recognize
the sound _ two hammers banged together by the survivors _ as a sign
of life had not diminished the rescue effort.
   ``We knew that the area (where the men were found) presented the
best possibility of finding survivors, and that's where we began
drilling,'' Cramer said.
   The six were discovered alive on Saturday, after officials
insisted there was no sign of life in the coal mine where 57 men had
been trapped since Wednesday.
   Prosecutors are investigating whether an open flame may have
ignited the gas explosion in the Stolzenbach mine in this town 72
miles northeast of Frankfurt, the ZDF television network reported
Monday.
   The television said cigarette lighters were found inside the
mine, but mine officials say there are strict regulations against
smoking underground.
   The six surviving miners had used lighters to test for the
presence of the deadly carbon monoxide _ an odorless and invisible
gas that burns with a pale-blue flame when ignited.
   They survived by finding an air pocket in a part of the mine free
of the gas.
   High concentrations of carbon monoxide slowed the agonizing
search for the last five men still missing in the depths of the
shaft. Officials said rescuers were forced to repeatedly renew their
oxygen supplies.
   Authorities said that because of the gas fumes, there was little
chance that the missing miners would be found alive.
   More details emerged about the harrowing ordeal of the survivors.
   Ahmet Batkan, the Turkish immigrant among them, was quoted as
saying the men had tried to pull a seriously injured comrade to the
air pocket, but the man reportedly along the way.
   ``He died in my arms,'' Batkan was quoted as saying in the Bild
newspaper.
   Prosecutor Stephan Walcher in the nearby city of Kassel said a
full investigation had been launched into the cause of the disaster.
   ``We will review all of the information being collected to
determine what caused the accident and whether there are grounds for
any criminal prosecution,'' Walcher told reporters at a news
conference at the mine.
   Officials have said the mine was regularly inspected and that all
government safety regulations were followed.
   Erwin Braun, head of the coal administration board in Kassel,
said an explosion of such ferocity had never been recorded in the
region.
   He praised the rescue efforts.
   News about last Wednesday's radio contact with the six survivors
has sparked intense media criticism of the rescue operation.
   The survivors were found after their signals were picked up by a
television crew's microphone, which had been lowered into a shaft
500 feet beneath the earth.
   A police spokesman in the nearby town of Dillich, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said a communications center set up after
the accident received a flood of calls from people offering to help
in the rescue efforts.
   He said some of the callers claimed they had seen where the
miners were trapped in their dreams.
   ``We tell the people we'll call them back if they are needed,''
the police spokesman said. ``So far, the rescue center has not asked
us to.''

<HEAD>Late Payments on Mortgages Drop To Second Lowest Level of Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In another sign of improving economic
conditions, the number of Americans late on their mortgage payments
fell to the second lowest level of this decade during the first
three months of the year, a trade group of lenders reported Monday.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association said the number of mortgage
payments late by 30 days or more dropped to 4.78 percent of total
mortgages in the first quarter, down from 4.95 percent in the last
three months of 1987.
   This was the second lowest late-payment level since 1979,
bettered only by a 4.71 percent deliquency rate in the third quarter
of 1987.
   The rate of foreclosures remained unchanged in the first quarter
at 0.27 percent of all mortgages, up slightly from the rate a year
ago.
   Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the association, said
``foreclosures remain a problem, especially in economically
depressed regions of the country.'' But he said the steady drop in
late payments should translate into lower foreclosures in quarters
ahead.
   All four regions of the country experienced lower late-payment
levels in the first quarter when compared with the same period a
year ago, when the overall late-payment rate was 5.17 percent.
   The largest decline was in the Northeast, where late payments
fell from 4.44 percent a year ago to 3.81 percent in the
January-March quarter, the lowest level of any region.
   The South, which has been hard hit by troubles in energy
producing states, saw the level of late payments fall from 5.72
percent down to 5.27 percent in the January-March quarter.
   The Midwest had a drop from 5.22 percent to 4.85 percent, while
the level of late payments in the West fell from 4.51 percent down
to 4.17 percent in the first quarter.

   Four New Mexico Republicans compete for a chance to challenge
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman and former Montana Gov. Thomas Judge
puts his comeback hopes on the line Tuesday, as seven states hold
primaries for state and local office.
   Senate races also are on tap in California, New Jersey and
Montana, while voters in Actims, and proposals to ease state spending limits
and curb
campaign spending.
   Locally, Sacramento voters could decide to close the Rancho Seco
nuclear power plant; San Bernardino County voters could split the
nation's largest county into two; and voters in seven Southern
California communities could impose limits on growth or force
developers to pay for it.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who won a special election two
years ago after Roger Hedgecock was convicted of a felony, is
seeking a full four-year term. She is expected to win a majority in
the non-partisan primary and thus avoid a runoff.
   In New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Peter Rodino is giving up his seat
after 20 terms amid growing sentiment that his Newark-area district
should be represented by the state's first black congressman. Two
black Newark city councilmen, Donald Payne and Ralph Grant, are
competing in the Democratic primary, with the winner expected to
defeat the GOP nominee, political newcomer Michael Webb, who also is
black.
   In New Mexico's GOP Senate race, state Sen. Bill Valentine led
the four-candidate field in a poll taken last week for the
Albuquerque Journal. The national Republican Party has targeted
Bingaman as vulnerable because he is a first-term liberal Democrat.
Bingaman has no primary opposition.
   The GOP also has designs on another first-term Democratic
senator, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who faces two little-known
candidates in Tuesday's primary. The only Republican contender is
Peter Dawkins, a former star athlete, Rhodes scholar and Vietnam War
hero who moved to New Jersey last year from New York to run for
office.
   A third Democratic senator seeking re-election is John Melcher of
Montana. To win a third term he must overcome attorney Robert
Kelleher in the primary and Republican Conrad Burns, a Yellowstone
County commissioner, in November.
   California's GOP Sen. Pete Wilson has no primary opponent, and
will likely face Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is running
against three political unknowns. Wilson has led in the polls, but
no one has been re-elected to his Senate seat for 30 years.
   In Montana's race for governor, Judge is one of six Democrats
seeking the nomination for the seat two-term Gov. Ted Schwinden is
relinquishing. Schwinden had defeated Judge in the 1980 Democratic
primary.
   A Montana Poll taken last week showed Judge was the choice of 28
percent of Democratic voters, but 35 percent were undecided.
   In the two-way Republican race, the poll showed a dead heat
between former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal Winslow.
Republicans have not won the governorship in 20 years and the GOP
favorite, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a plane
crash in April.

<HEAD>Abstentions, Withdrawals Important Second-Round Factors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key to any conservative success in this week's
runoff for the National Assembly is in the extreme-right National
Front after a surprisingly strong showing by the rightists in round
No. 1.
   After President Francois Mitterrand's re-election last month with
a hefty 54 percent of the vote, the polls, analysts and most
politicians expected a Socialist tidal wave in Sunday's voting for
the 577-seat National Assembly.
   But the right and center-right parties ran even with the
Socialists in popular vote.
   As the support is distributed, however, the Socialists have an
edge to win a majority of seats.
   But a foregone conclusion suddenly became a horse race, and on
Monday, the most sought after people in France were the 34.5 percent
of voters who didn't cast ballots Sunday.
   Some analysts said the voters indicated they wanted a balance of
power between the right and left, such as the ``cohabitation'' that
existed between the Socialist Mitterrand and the conservatives who
won control of the National Assembly in the 1986 elections.
   Two important factors affect the June 12 runoff. One is how many
of the registered voters who didn't go to the polls Sunday can be
persuaded to vote.
   Turnout in the first round was the lowest for any election in
post-war France.
   ``The level of abstentions has created suspense for the second
round and unexpectedly invigorated the campaign,'' wrote the leftist
daily Liberation. ``This will not exactly be the pleasure cruise
predicted by the polls.''
   The other factor is strategic withdrawal.
   In districts where no candidate won a majority, all those with
12.5 percent or more were eligible for the runoff which, depending
on the constituency, could involve several candidates.
   In the past, to set up a direct right-left confrontation, the
Communists and Socialists have agreed to back the best-placed
leftist candidate. The traditional rightist parties did the same.
   This time, while the Socialists and Communists will implement the
withdrawal strategy, the question remains about what the National
Front will do.
   The conservative Rally for the Republic and center-right Union
for French Democracy fielded a single candidate in each district. In
districts where the National Front candidate qualified for the
runoff along with the joint RPR-UDF candidate, he could split the
rightist vote and effectively elect a Socialist or Communist.
   National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said he was ready to help
defeat the Socialists by withdrawing his candidates in favor of
leading RPR-UDF candidates, but only if the RPR and UDF did the same
in constituencies where National Front candidates were leading.
   Alain Juppe, former spokesman for the outgoing conservative
government, said the RPR-UDF coalition maintained its refusal to
deal with the National Front but would appeal directly to its voters
to help defeat the left.
   Strategy meetings were going on at major party headquarters all
over Paris on Monday.
   ``The French must confirm their will not to confide all power in
our country to a single party and, you and me, we must work toward
that this week,'' said former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said it was ``reasonable to think
that (Socialist Premier) Michel Rocard's government may be able to
count on a parliamentary majority.''
   In popular vote, the RPR-UDF candidates won 37.67 percent of the
vote, while the Socialists and their allies won 37.55. The
Communists scored 11.32 percent and the National Front 9.65 percent.
The rest went to minor parties.
   In actual seats, the RPR-UDF candidates won 76 seats in the first
round, the Socialists 40, minor rightists three, the Communists one
and the National Front none. But the Socialists were in better
position to win a majority of the 455 seats being decided in the
runoff.

   Pope John Paul II has written a letter to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev that will be delivered in Moscow by the Vatican
secretary of state, the Italian news agency ANSA said Monday.
   The agency attributed the report to unidentified officials
traveling with the pope in Italy. It said the officials did not
disclose the contents of the letter.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Monday night that he
cannot confirm the report. Earlier, The Associated Press erroneously
quoted a Vatican official as saying the pope had given the Vatican
secretary of state a letter to deliver for the Communist Party
general secretary.
   ANSA said the letter would be delivered by Cardinal Agostino
Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of state. He is scheduled to leave
for Moscow on Wednesday to take part in the celebration marking
1,000 years of Christianity in parts of what is now the Soviet Union.
   The Vatican has said that the pope was not invited to attend the
millennium celebration.

   The French Society for the Export of Armaments, a

   The agreement also covers the sale of an unspecified number of

   In reporting the agreement, French radio said the contract was

the contract was for less than that amount.

   President Reagan said Monday that while the
Moscow summit produced ``important additional strides'' toward a
strategic arms treaty, ``we still don't know'' when it can be
achieved.
   In a post-summit assessment of his talks with Soviet General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Reagan acknowledged that completion
of the less-ambitious Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF,
treaty was ``the event that held perhaps the most immediate historic
importance.''
   Reagan looked rested and refreshed after a quiet weekend at the
White House, and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president
``feels very good, in fact, frisky.''
   The 77-year-old chief executive had seemed fatigued at times last
week, and he spoke in a hoarse voice during an address in London on
Friday, the day after the summit ended.
   In his speech Monday to the World Gas Conference, Reagan said
``the significance of this (INF) treaty can hardly be overstated.''
   ``These missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the
map or placed in storage; they will have been destroyed,'' he said.
   Although the two sides remained far apart on many matters
involving a Strategic Arms Reduction, or START, treaty slashing up
to 50 percent of the U.S. and Soviet stockpiles of the most
dangerous missiles in their arsenals, Reagan did say that he and
Gorbachev had made progress.
   Gorbachev had voiced disappointment in Moscow that the talks did
not move further, lamenting ``missed opportunities.''
   Among other things, the two sides failed to narrow differences
over the inclusion of sea-launched cruise missiles in such a treaty.
   At the outset of his speech to the members of natural gas
associations from some 45 countries, Reagan noted the presence of
Soviet delegates.
   ``If you're wondering about the weather back in Moscow,'' he
said, ``well, lately, most of the days have been sunny and mild.''
   Reagan reviewed the progression of arms reduction talks he and
Gorbachev had in Geneva, Iceland and Washington. He said the United
States strives to accomplish ``comprehensive verification
provisions'' for a strategic arms accord, ``building on those'' in
the INF pact.
   ``In Moscow, we made made important additional strides toward
that objective,'' he said. But he also noted that ``verification, in
particular, represents one of the most important and difficult
issues.''
   ``When will the START treaty be completed? We still do not
know,'' the president said. ``But I can say to you we're moving
forward on the treaty and its associated documents with renewed
vigor and cooperation. I won't set deadlines.''
   U.S. and Soviet arms-control negotiators in Geneva are in recess
this month, and neither side has committed to a fifth
Reagan-Gorbachev summit before the president's term ends next
January.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said ``it would be
unwise to rush negotiations on START, and I compliment the president
on the position that he has taken also in that regard.''
   ``Headline-grabbing summits are one thing, but rushing to meet a
deadline on a treaty as important as START would be irresponsible,''
Byrd said in a speech on the Senate floor.
   ``Now may be a good time to reduce the fanfare of the summit and
let the negotiators do their important work in quiet,'' said Byrd.
``Further, with a change in presidents on the horizon, I do not
believe it would be wise to lock the next president into a hasty
agreement, be he a Republican or a Democrat.''
   Much of Reagan's speech was studded with the kinds of personal
remembrances and anecdotes that marked his earlier comments about
the Moscow experience.
   He said his greatest Moscow triumph came, not in the face-to-face
talks with Gorbachev inside the Kremlin walls, but in the ``words of
faith, words of freedom, words of truth'' that he relayed to the
Soviet people.
   ``It made me feel humble, that's the only way you could feel, it
made me think that visiting Moscow on behalf of the American people
was one of the highest privileges of my life,'' Reagan said.
   In his third such upbeat assessement of the summit within four
days, Reagan said came away with an ``impression of change, an
impression of new possibilities, of new hope'' during his five-day
visit to a land undergoing revolutionary change with Gorbachev's
policies of ``glasnost'' and ``perestroika,'' or openness and
restructuring.
   The president said he was encouraged by his meetings with
Gorbachev on arms control, regional and bilateral matters and human
rights. And he noted that he'd been able to reach out to the Soviet
people by meeting with dissidents, refuseniks and Russian Orthodox
monks.
   He also recounted that according to one newspaper report, an
elderly woman who'd seen his stroll about a Moscow street was quoted
as saying, ``I like it that he says, `God bless you.'''
   ``There perhaps lies the greatest significance of what took place
in Moscow last week _ not that Ronald Reagan spoke there,'' he said.
``I was only giving voice to the abiding beliefs of the American
people, indeed of free people everywhere.
   ``No, it was that the words that were spoken were words of faith,
words of freedom, words of truth,'' Reagan said. ``Unarmed truth is
irresistable.''

   A man whose attempt to sell his young
daughter for $100,000 in a Giants Stadium parking lot sparked a
three-way custody battle pleaded guilty Monday to endangering the
child's welfare.
   Joseph Waltman, 24, of Alloway Township, faces a maximum of five
years in prison and a $75,000 fine after entering into a plea
agreement with prosecutors. He is to be sentenced July 13.
   ``I took the law into my own hands,'' Waltman said. He would not
comment about how he felt about his daughter or the family who won
custody.
   In exchange for his plea, charges of conspiracy and illegally
placing a child for adoption were dropped.
   The attempted sale of Waltman's daughter, Rachel Rauser, was
followed by a bitter custody dispute. The child, 5, now lives with
an uncle in Florida.
   Waltman was arrested March 19, 1987, in the parking lot at Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford on charges he tried to sell the girl to
her uncle, Gary Stern. Stern was cooperating with authorities and
undercover agents had been watching.
   A three-way dispute followed with Stern and his wife, Deborah,
the child's grandparents, and Waltman's estranged wife, Cynthia
Sullivan-Waltman, all wanting custody.
   Rachel's mother, Michal Rauser, had died in a fiery car accident
in 1984, and a judge awarded the girl a $3 million settlement. She
will receive a lump-sum payment when she reaches 18 and monthly
payments of $1,500 for life.
   The custody battle ended in December when the Sterns, of Sunrise,
Fla., were granted custody of Rachel. The judge said the ruling was
based on expert mental health reports, but he did not elaborate on
his decision.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Stern said when told of
Monday's plea. ``I'm going to tell my wife and family, and for the
first time in a long time we can sleep easy knowing justice
prevailed. If you wait long enough, it always does.''
   Waltman agreed to the plea bargain for peace of mind, said his
attorney, James Patuto.
   ``He was at the end of his rope. He had four years of custody
fights. He was out of money, his marriage was breaking up,'' said
Patuto.

   Michael Dukakis, a day away from sewing up the
Democratic presidential nomination, reached out to fellow Democrat
Jesse Jackson and jabbed at Republican George Bush on Monday.
   Expecting to win the delegates needed to assure him the
nomination in Tuesday's last round of primaries, Dukakis spoke of
party unity and said he believed Jackson would campaign for him in
the fall.
   ``I know how strongly he feels about the importance of a Democrat
in the White House in January,'' Dukakis said as he campaigned
around California on the eve of its primary.
   Dukakis telephoned Jackson after arriving in Los Angeles late
Sunday night. Dukakis senior adviser Paul Brountas said the two
``just chatted _ both were very tired.'' The Massachusetts governor
also took a call from defeated Democratic rival Paul Simon.
   Dukakis spoke to students outside Taft High School in Woodland
Hills, a section of Los Angeles, and later told reporters he hoped
he and Jackson would meet soon.
   ``We try our best to get together from time to time,'' Dukakis
said. ``I don't know whether we'll be able to do that in these next
couple of days, but if we can, we will.''
   Dukakis lacks only about 200 of the 2,081 delegates needed to win
the nomination, and his aides were clearly confident he would secure
what was needed from the 466 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, 314
of them in California. Also holding primaries are New Jersey, New
Mexico and Montana.
   Dukakis said he expected Jackson to work for the Democratic
ticket.
   ``If the tables were reversed and he was on his way to the
nomination and I was the runner-up, I'd expect to be deeply
involved. ... I'd try to bring my people into this. I'd be as much
service to the ticket as I possibly could,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I'm cnfident he will be that kind of person.''
   Dukakis and his aides hope he can declare he has gone over the
top in the delegate race Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, before
flying back to Massachusetts.
   After Los Angeles, he flew to San Diego on Monday, for another
campaign appearance, and was traveling to San Jose before returning
to Los Angeles. He planned a morning appearance Tuesday before
awaiting the primary results in his Century City hotel.
   ``This has been a great 15 months,'' he said. ``I'm excited about
what has happened, and I'm looking forward if all goes well to a
decisive victory here in California, in New Jersey, in Montana and
in New Mexico, so we can lock up this nomination.''
   Asked about his conversation with Jackson and about bringing his
Democratic rival into the fall effort, Dukakis said: ``The process
has already begun. We're talking. Our staffs have been talking.''
   ``We'll be reaching out to supporters of Jesse, and the other
Democratic candidates, as we have already. The response has been
terrific,'' he said. ``I'm really overwhelmed by the good feeling,
the spirit, the confidence. A sense of victory is in the air.''
   Dukakis jabbed at Bush about off-shore oil drilling, an issue in
California, and Bush's apparent change of position Sunday. The vice
president, who has supported off-shore drilling, said he favored
delaying the lease sale of a tract off the northern California coast.
   ``I'm pleased he's coming around, but it's kind of late,''
Dukakis said. ``I'm not for delaying that sale _ I'm for canceling
it.
   ``It's easy to say, `We'll delay it until after the election,'''
Dukakis said. ``What does that mean? What does that mean?''
   Dukakis said he opposes off-shore drilling in ``environmentally
sensitive'' areas but stopped short of saying there should be a
moratorium on all drilling off shore.

   Gaps in insurance coverage, a dearth of
long-term care and lack of services for the poor are among the most
pressing problems facing AIDS patients, health professionals said
Monday.
   ``Our biggest problems are acute care for indigent AIDS patients
and long-term custodial care,'' Katherine Wright, a care coordinator
at the AIDS Arms Network in Dallas, told a Senate committee.
   Wright said many AIDS patients die in the hospital because their
insurance does not cover home care, hospices are unavailable or
nursing homes will not accept them.
   She also cited gaps in the private and government insurance
systems, and said more than half the clients her organization sees
spend themselves down to the poverty level to qualify for help from
the state-federal Medicaid program.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Government Affairs
Committee, said the number of full-blown AIDS cases in the United
States is expected to reach 450,000 by 1993.
   ``We must take steps now to meet the challenges presented by the
tremendous increase in AIDS cases that is upon us,'' he said.
   Glenn cited two recent reports recommending increased federal
funding and involvement in the AIDS crisis _ one from the Institute
of Medicine and the other from the chairman of the Presidential
Commission on AIDS.
   Dr. David Sundwall, adminstrator of the federal Health Resources
and Services Administration, said his agency is spending nearly $37
million on AIDS grant programs this year and is requesting $40
million for fiscal 1989.
   He declined to say more money is needed but acknowledged that his
agency receives about twice as many grant proposals as it can fund.
He also said some services fall short.
   ``In order to to cope with the inevitable, increasing burden ...
we're going to have to have better long-term care,'' Sundwall said.
   Sundwall said people are backed up in hospital beds in many
regions because they don't have anywhere else to go. He said the
crunch is regional and his agency is considering numerous
strategies, among them block grants to states based on their number
of AIDS cases.
   ``Ideally, a comprehensive AIDS service delivery network would
include hospital services; outpatient, physician or clinic services;
home health care, subacute skilled nursing, in-home support
services; mental health services and counseling; housing,
employment, legal and financial services,'' Sundwall said.
   Dr. June Osborn, dean of the School of Public Health at the
University of Michigan, said communities need to realistically
assess whether they have enough hospital beds to accomodate the
expected surge in AIDS patients and ``there should be provision made
for outpatient care.''
   Osborn also said the nursing shortage poses ``an ominous threat''
in some areas. And she warned that planning is needed to ensure that
new and experimental AIDS therapies are available on a equitable
basis, as well as to ``avoid disastrous competition in hospital
pharmacy budgets with drugs for other groups of patients.''
   ``All of these issues and many more command attention,'' she said
in her testimony. ``We have an urgent agenda.''

   A San Jose-bound American Airlines jet
carrying 105 people returned safely to Los Angeles International
Airport on Monday after fuel leaked from a wing because a fuel cap
didn't work, officials said.
   American Flight 2223, a Boeing 737, was loaded with 16,000 pounds
of fuel when it took off at 10:37 a.m. The pilot returned to Los
Angeles declaring an emergency, said Elly Brekke, a spokeswoman for
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``An air traffic controller advised the pilot that fuel was
venting from the right wing,'' she said.
   With firefighters standing by, jetliner landed safely at 10:57
a.m., and the passengers and crew left without having to use
emergency chutes, Ms. Brekke said.
   ``Our maintenance people have examined the plane and determined
that a locking tab on a filler cap on the upper right wing was not
functioning,'' Steve McGregor, an American Airlines spokesman in
Fort Worth, Texas, said by telephone. ``There was indeed a fuel
leak.''
   McGregor said the passengers were placed on American flight 1091,
which left Los Angeles for San Jose at 11:39 a.m.
   He said the plane with the malfunctioning filler cap was expected
to be back in service later in the day.

   Congress should reinstate the president's power
to impound appropriated money as a way of bringing the federal
budget deficit under control, former President Gerald Ford said
Monday.
   ``The budget process is in total shambles,'' Ford said in a
speech at the National Press Club.
   The power of impoundment was ended in 1974, when Congress moved
to streamline the budget process.
   Using impoundment, a president could sign an appropriations bill
yet refuse to spend part of the money in what Ford called ``an
important tool of fiscal responsibility.''
   ``The anti-impoundment provisions in my opinion have been a
disaster,'' Ford said. The present system is ``no substitute for
strong action by the president of the United States,'' he said.
   ``If we are irresponsible, if we blow it, there is no doubt in my
mind that we are gambling with the health and security of the United
States,'' he said.
   Allowing presidents to impound money would be a quick solution to
the present budget difficulties, since reinstating the process would
require only legislation rather than a constitutional amendment,
Ford said.
   Ford on Monday unveiled his portrait at the Smithsonian
Institution's Hall of the Presidents, the first presidential
portrait painted explicitly for the collection.
   The portrait shows Ford dressed in a dark, pin-striped suit,
standing in a half-length pose, his right hand on his hip. It was
painted by Everett Raymond Kinstler.
   It will be on permanent exhibit in the Hall of the Presidents,
which shows likenesses of every president from George Washington to
Ronald Reagan.
   Ford was the House Republican leader when he was appointed vice
president in 1973 after Spiro Agnew resigned from the office.
   Ford became president the next year with the resignation of
Richard Nixon, thus becoming the first U.S. president that had never
won a national election.
   The portrait was painted after Ford left office in 1980. It was a
gift of the Gerald R. Ford Foundation of Grand Rapids, Mich., which
operates a museum and library dedicated to Ford's term in office.
   Kinstler painted the official White House portraits of both Nixon
and Ford.

   John Corcoran graduated from high school, got
a college degree, taught school and made millions in real estate
development while living a deception. He couldn't read.
   It all came undone when a drop in business forced him to fire the
people who did his reading and return to the classroom, this time as
a student.
   ``It's a national crisis. It can't be put on the back burner any
longer,'' Corcoran said in a telephone interview Monday. ``This
isn't something like drugs or AIDS. This is something we can do
something about.''
   Corcoran, a resident of Oceanside, came to the city over the
weekend to promote Project Literacy L.A., an effort to ``make other
people aware of the slavery of illiteracy in America.''
   ``There's a chaos that goes on when you're illiterate in
America,'' he said. ``There's a world out there that functions with
the written word, and you don't know that. All you can do is orally
communicate.''
   He learned to read after enrolling in the Carlsbad City Library
Adult Learning Program in September 1986, studying and sounding out
words 40 to 50 hours a week for more than 14 months.
   On Sunday, Corcoran demonstrated his new skills by reading during
services at the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles.
   ``There's a real desire in me to do everything I can to try to
make other people aware of the slavery of illiteracy in America,''
he said. ``We have a problem that we can solve. That means reform.
It means change.''
   Corcoran, now 50, said he attended many schools as a youngster
because his parents changed jobs often. He was never at one school
long enough for teachers to realize he couldn't read.
   ``If you tell somebody you can't read, you're telling someone
you're dumb,'' he said. ``I couldn't really reach out for help.''
   To compensate, Corcoran said he made friends with people who had
good vocabularies, and he used a lot of analogies and metaphors when
he spoke. He said his wife Kathy was the only one who knew about his
illiteracy.
   He received a bachelor's degree in education from Texas Western
College, now University of Texas, at El Paso, where he was the
captain of the basketball team.
   Corcoran won National Science Foundation grants to study in
graduate schools at San Diego State, Louisiana State University and
University of Santa Clara.
   He said he avoided reading by misbehaving in grade school, and in
high school he cheated on tests by preparing answers beforehand or
refusing to turn in tests.
   In college, he faked or cheated his way through general education
courses, then chose classes where take-home tests were assigned, or
accounting classes where tests involved numbers, which gave him no
trouble.
   As a teacher, he said he relied on students in his social
studies, business and math classes to call roll and to read to the
others.
   ``Everything was oral,'' he said. ``I taught to them the modes I
learned by.''
   Corcoran said he went into the real estate development business
while he was teaching, and eventually became the owner of a
multimillion-dollar company. Secretaries, accountants, bookkeepers
and lawyers surrounded him and did all of his reading and writing.
   Corcoran said the loss of his employees in 1986, combined with
public service announcements he saw on television, prompted him to
seek help.
   Illiteracy is common among people at every level, and it may be
more difficult for people with Corcoran's success to come forward
and admit the problem, said Lynda Jones, program coordinator for the
Carlsbad Library's adult learning program.
   ``In daily life they're probably dealing with more stress because
they're dealing with people who don't know,'' she said. ``They want
to be sure that no one is going to see them.''
   Corcoran took part in a literacy symposium in Washington, D.C.,
and has made a dozen trips around the country promoting literacy,
and said he is writing a book to tell his story.

   The Supreme Court on Monday provided a victory
for women seeking financial support for their illegitimate children,
and the court also expanded its study of drug testing in the
American workplace.
   In a unanimous decision, the justices ruled as unconstitutional a
Pennsylvania law that had said the mother of an illegitimate child
must sue the alleged father for support within six years of the
child's birth.
   The decision hinted that the court might frown on state laws
preventing mothers from suing on behalf of any minor child _ in
effect requiring an 18-year deadline for paternity suits.
   Congress called for such 18-year deadlines in the Child Support
Enforcement Amendments of 1984 but the justices passed up the chance
of ruling whether the federal law is binding on the states.
   Instead, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court that
Pennsylvania's former six-year deadline violated equal-protection
rights. The state's law always had let legitimate children sue for
parental support any time before their 18th birthdays.
   Diane Dodson, a lawyer with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, said
the ruling represents ``a second chance for thousands of children
who were once barred from collecting child support because they
waited too long to establish paternity.''
   About 1.5 million illegitimate children in the United States
receive no financial support from one parent, and Ms. Dodson said as
many as 400,000 might be affected by Monday's ruling.
   ``Anyone who had been told she waited too long to take her
children's father to court to collect child support may be able to
reopen the matter so long as the children still are under age 18,''
she said.
   The decision reinstated Cherlyn Clark's 1983 lawsuit against Gene
Jeter for support of her daughter, Tiffany, who was born in
Pittsburgh in 1973.
   In a separate action, the court said it will decide whether the
nation's railroads may require all employees involved in serious
accidents to take tests designed to detect alcohol and drug use.
   The court agreed to review a Feb. 11 ruling by the San
Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that such tests,
conducted by private employers acting for the government, are
unreasonable searches banned by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.
   The railroad drug-testing case stems from regulations issued by
the Federal Railroad Administration in 1985 to alleviate ``a
significant safety problem'' caused by alcohol and drug use by rail
employees.
   The justices last February said they would decide whether the
U.S. Customs Service may conduct drug tests for those seeking
drug-enforcement jobs. A federal appeals court condoned such testing.
   On Monday, the justices said they will study the Customs Service
and railroad employees cases together. A decision is expected
sometime in 1989.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley welcomed the court's review
of the railroad drug tests and predicted the justices would permit
the tests.
   ``If we can constitutionally test jockeys to protect public
confidence in the racetrack betting system, we surely must be able
to test railroad operating personnel to protect human lives,''
Burnley said in a statement.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Ruled unanimously in a case from Colorado that states allowing
voter initiatives may not prohibit groups from paying those who
gather the petition signatures necessary to get an issue on the
ballot.
   _Ruled that two convicted murderers _ Ralph Mills in Maryland and
William Thomas Cartwright in Oklahoma _ were sentenced to death in
constitutionally unacceptable ways. The rulings mean that both men
are entitled to new sentencing trials.
   _Agreed to return to a confusing area of the law and clarify
whether, or when, law enforcement officials may battle drug
trafficking by stopping and questioning people at airports because
their characteristics fit that of a ``drug courier profile.''
   _Ruled unanimously in an Illinois case that states may offer more
protection than provided in federal labor law for workers allegedly
mistreated by their employers.
   _Refused to order states to give refunds to businesses when a
state tax is invalidated as a violation of interstate commerce. The
justices refused to apply retroactively a 1987 ruling in which they
struck down a Washington state manufacturing tax that favored some
in-state businesses.

<HEAD>Baker Took $429,000 When He Left Law Firm To Work for Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howard H. Baker Jr., chief of staff at the
White House, received $429,817 last year when he terminated his
partnerships in two law firms to go to work for President Reagan, it
was disclosed Monday.
   White House counsel Arthur Culvahouse Jr., who was a partner with
Baker at the Houston-based Vinson & Elkins law firm, received
$206,349 in partnership profits and as a refund for money
contributed to a retirement plan.
   The settlements were disclosed in annual financial disclosure
reports submitted to the Office of Government Ethics.
   Baker took over the top staff job at the White House in February
1987, when Donald T. Regan was ousted from the job.
   In returning to government, Baker, a former senator from
Tennessee, had to return $83,333 in consulting fees that had been
prepaid by Merrill Lynch for his services throughout 1987, the
disclosure form said.
   As chief of staff, Baker earns $89,500.
   His report said Baker received $262,275 from Vinson & Elkins in
undistributed profits from a partnership arrangement begun in 1985
after he left the Senate. Likewise, he received $167,542 from the
Knoxville, Tenn., law firm of Baker, Worthington, Crossley,
Stansberry & Woolf.
   He got $8,500 in director's fees from AT&T and $12,000 from MCA
Inc.
   Kenneth A. Duberstein, who was brought in as deputy chief of
staff in March 1987, not long after Baker's arrival, reported
$291,440 in settlement salary and compensation from Timmons and Co.,
a business consulting firm where he had worked previously.
   Duberstein also received $18,000 for work he did for HTB Inc. of
Oklahoma City, an architectural consulting firm, although Duberstein
also terminated his contract with that firm when he came to the
White House.

<HEAD>Government Bank Resumes Lending to Nigeria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's Export-Import Bank said Monday
it was resuming lending to Nigeria, Africa's most populous country,
after it cleared up overdue payments on $388 million in outstanding
loans.
   Nigeria is a major exporter of oil to this country.
   The bank, which makes loans to encourage U.S. exports, will lend
Nigerian borrowers as much as $10 million on each export agreement.
Repayment must be completed in five years. Loans for larger projects
will be considered if the money goes to different borrowers.
   The bank has been unwilling to lend to Nigeria since 1985. The
change was made possible by new policies that the government of Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida has undertaken, the bank said. But the bank still
is unwilling to make long-term loans, which also were cut off in
1985.
   Nigeria is one of the Third World's largest debtors, with about
$27 billion outstanding, according to the World Bank. Like big
debtors in Latin America and unlike most African countries, Nigeria
owes most of its debt _ about 55 percent _ to commercial banks
rather than to governments.
   ``We applaud the government of Nigeria's efforts to regain
economic balance and endorse their continuing movement toward
economic reform,'' bank President John A. Bohn Jr. said in
announcing its new policy.
   He said it would continue to watch Nigeria's economic progress
and that the U.S. loans will help Nigeria buy the machines and
services it needs to restore growth.
   Nigeria has been hard hit by the drop in the price of oil, its
major export. The World Bank calculates that the income of the
average Nigerian _ there are more than 103 million of them _ dropped
to $640 in 1986, from $820 the year before.
   Bohn praised the Nigerian government's efforts to work with the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. On their advice,
Nigeria recently increased domestic prices of gasoline and diesel
fuel in an effort to reduce its $1.5 billion budget deficit.
   The increase touched off a two-week strike that paralyzed medical
and banking services and brought on demonstrations in which at least
six people were killed. The strike ended last month.

   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson of Kentucky endorsed
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis for the party's presidential
nomination Monday and said that almost all of the Kentucky
delegation to the national convention will follow his lead.
   The switch means 41 delegates, most of whom were previously
committed to dropout candidate Albert Gore Jr., will jump to the
Dukakis camp. As it now stands, all but six of Kentucky's 67
delegates to the July convention will back the Massachusetts
governor.
   The remaining delegates are committed to Jesse Jackson.
   Wilkinson, who had earlier pledged his support to Gore, said Gore
had not formally released him from that support but did not object
to the switch in allegiance.
   The change came as the Dukakis camp was hoping to muster enough
delegates to assure a first-ballot nomination at the convention in
Atlanta.

<TEXT>
   A handmade rug, two years in the design and
making and purchased by an anonymous donor for $49,625 at the
request of Nancy Reagan, has been installed in the Oval Office of
the White House, it was announced Monday.
   The all-wool, oval-shaped rug measures 31 feet 2 inches by 23
feet 9 inches and weighs more than 375 pounds, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   With a 4-foot, circular presidential seal at its center, the rug
is decorated with 40 custom-dyed colors. The predominant color is
peach or coral. The outer border, 18 inches wide, is decorated with
green olive leaves and garlands.
   The rug was installed while President Reagan was at the Moscow
summit. It replaced a specially designed oval rug, with turquoise
rosettes on a pale gold background, that was installed in 1976. The
old rug will be put in storage, Fitzwater said.
   He said the Reagans ``wanted to leave an asset to the White House
and they felt this would be an attractive asset.''
   He said the first lady worked with the White House curator and
White House Historical Association to design the rug and get a
donor, who wished not to be identified.
   The rug was made in Auburn, Maine, for the Stark Carpet Corp. of
New York City.

<TEXT>
   George P. Shultz carried his faltering
campaign for Arab-Israeli peace to Syria and told reporters Monday
the United States and Soviet Union will continue discussions on a
Middle East settlement.
   The U.S. secretary of state spent about four hours in Damascus,
half of it in meetings with President Hafez Assad, who has taken a
hard line on peace with Israel.
   He then came Egypt, where he toured ancient Luxor and scheduled a
meeting Tuesday with President Hosni Mubarak before ending his
fourth Middle East mission of the year.
   Shultz briefed Assad on last week's U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow
and, after a discussion of an increase in international terrorism,
offered to share information with him about the problem, a senior
U.S official said Monday.
   Shultz then flew to Luxor, at the site of the ancient Nile-side
Egyptian capital Thebes, 420 miles south of Cairo, and toured the
tombs of the pharaohs.
   Dressed in a blue golf cap and a green sports shirt, he seemed
relaxed after 3{ days of tough diplomacy with the leaders of Israel,
Jordan and Syria.
   The tombs and the majestic temple column of Karnak, the national
shrine of ancient Egypt, are reached by crossing the Nile by ferry.
Egyptian frogmen and armed partol boats kept watch over the
secretary and his delegation.
   Shultz's meeting with Assad reflected continuing improvement in
U.S relations with a country the State Department still lists as a
supporter of terrorism.
   Speaking to Arab reporters afterward, he said the United States
and Soviet Union have ``agreed to continue to address ourselves to
the Middle East issues.
   ``We will have some continuing discussions, probably before long,
on an intensive basis,'' Shultz said. ``It's not for the Soviet
Union and the United States to resolve the problems here. It's for
the countries in the region to resolve their problems.''
   He added, however, that the superpowers ``have a certain amount
of influence, and if we see some things in a parallel way it will
probably make an impact.''
   Washington has dropped its opposition to a Soviet role in a
Middle East peace conference but objects to an active part for
outside powers in negotiations between Israel and its Arab foes.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel opposes any Soviet role
but plans to meet the Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, at the United Nations. It will be the latest of
several recent contacts between the two countries, which do not have
formal diplomatic relations.
   Shultz has been unable to bridge the gap between Israel and the
Arabs over the U.S. peace proposals, which include an international
conference and trading Israeli-occupied land for peace.
   King Hussein of Jordan said Saturday that Israeli withdrawal from
occupied territories is a condition for talks. Shamir opposes
condition and has balked at Shultz's insistence on at least a
partial Israeli pullback.
   In comments to the Arab reporters, Shultz said both sides could
work with his proposal ``if people will cast aside their extreme
views, their illusions, and operate on the basis of reality.''
   The secretary said he considers the Arab demand for an
independent Palestinian nation ``unworkable'' and suggested ``a
confederation, or an attachment to another state.'' He said it could
be similar to an American state or a Swiss canton.
   About Lebanon, Shultz said he believed it ``important that
(presidential) elections go ahead'' as planned even if there is no
solution to the country's constitutional crisis.
   U.S. officials have welcomed Syria's military role in Lebanon's
Moslem areas and have worked with Syria in trying to win Christian
political concessions that might help calm the 13-year-old sectarian
civil war.
   There has been no sign, however, that the Lebanese Forces, the
main Christian militia, will accept any plan ending Christian
political dominance in a country that now has a Moslem majority.

<TEXT>
   Some supporters of Jesse Jackson complained
Monday that the Democratic presidential contender will be denied his
fair share of delegates in New Jersey's primary election on Tuesday.
   ``We're fighting for, essentially, a moral principle,'' said
Frank Watkins, Jackson's national political director.
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, Jackson's state campaign chairman,
said New Jersey's ``winner-take-all'' delegate apportionment will
leave Jackson with fewer delegates than he deserves.
   James and some others in the Jackson camp demanded that
Democratic party leaders give Jackson a large portion _ perhaps all
_ of the ``at-large'' New Jersey delegates. Those delegates are
expected to go mainly to Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   James accused party leaders _ including Sen. Bill Bradley, a
Dukakis backer _ of refusing to return telephone calls to discuss
the dispute.
   The Jackson backers said if the matter isn't settled by Tuesday,
they would take their complaints to the party's national convention
next month in Atlanta.
   ``We're calling for fairness. We are prepared to go all the way
to Atlanta with this fight,'' said James.
   Under state party rules, voters will elect 71 pledged delegates
Tuesday from 20 specially created delegate districts. Then, party
leaders will meet June 26 to pick an additional 38 at-large
delegates, pledged in proportion to the elected delegates. The state
has nine ``super delegates,'' who are state members of the
Democratic National Committee.
   Jackson backers claim the delegate districts have been drawn
unfairly, diluting urban populations _ where Jackson is strong _
with suburbs, where he is weaker.
   The Jackson supporters also criticized the winner-take-all
system, whereby candidates will win all of district's delegates if
they win anything above 50 percent of the votes cast.
   James said Jackson could get 49 percent of the votes cast, and
yet end up with only a handful of delegates. He called the process
``unfair, constitutional.''

<HEAD>Fires Contained After Destroying Or Damaging Seven Buildings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Firefighters on Monday mopped up remnants of blazes that charred
nearly 2,200 acres in three Southern California counties, including
one fire that destroyed six buildings and another started by boys
playing with a toy rocket.
   No one was injured in any of the fires, officials said.
   In southeast Montana, hundreds of firefighters worked in
100-degree heat and winds of up to 25 mph to fight a wildfire that
surged across 6,000 acres of grassland and timber on the Northern
Cheyenne Indian Reservation Monday.
   Twenty smoke jumpers parachuted into the most difficult area at
mid-morning, and officials called in a total of 400 firefighters
during the day, said Keith Mosbaugh, fire boss for the interagency
team trying to control the blaze.
   He said firefighters do not expect to contain the blaze before
Thursday.
   No one was injured, Mosbaugh added.
   The fire broke out late Saturday or early Sunday and may have
been caused by children playing with matches, said Mike Caprata, a
fire management forester with the Bureau of Indian Affairs at Lame
Deer. The cause was under investigation.
   The largest California blaze burned 1,800 acres on the outskirts
of Desert Hot Springs, a community of 6,000 people 110 miles east of
Los Angeles, said Cheri Hill, a dispatcher-clerk for the Riverside
County Fire Department.
   Crews hoped to control the fire, or extinguish most of its
flames, by Monday evening after more than 200 firefighters contained
its spread 12 hours earlier, she said. The wind-whipped fire
destroyed three homes and three other buildings and damaged another
home, she said.
   The cause of the fire, which started Sunday afternoon in the
center divider of Highway 62 about 4{ miles north of Desert Hot
Springs, was under investigation, Ms. Hill said.
   Despite 15 mph to 30 mph winds, crews expected to control a
220-acre fire in the San Bernardino National Forest about 85 miles
northeast of Los Angeles by Tuesday morning, after containing it at
8 a.m. Monday, said forest spokeswoman Lindsay Maierhofer.
   The blaze of unknown origin burned in dense pinon and juniper
trees and destroyed an abandoned mining shack. It was reported early
Sunday afternoon, and 390 firefighters, four helicopters and three
air tankers were sent to the battle.
   A 170-acre brush and grass fire near the El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station, 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles, was controlled at 9 p.m.
Sunday, nearly seven hours after it was reported, said county fire
department Capt. Patrick McIntosh. The fire was started by three
teen-agers who were playing with a model rocket, he said.
   The three boys, ages 15, 16 and 17, were taken into custody and
later released to their parents, McIntosh said, adding that ``the
fire department will seek cost recovery from the parents for the
firefighting operations.
   He said 150 firefighters fought the fire with equipment that
included two fire-retardant-dropping planes.

<HEAD>Pentagon Seeks To Give Sophisticated Naval Air Defense System to
Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration notified Congress on
Monday it had approved a $486 million arms sale to Japan involving
the U.S. Navy's most sophisticated shipboard air defense system.
   The Pentagon, in a series of announcements, also notified
Congress of additional arms sale plans involving South Korea, Greece
and Turkey. Those deals will total about $200 million.
   Assuming congressional approval, Japan will be allowed to buy the
complete package of radars, vertical launching systems for missiles,
satellite positioning gear and Phalanx anti-missile guns needed to
build its own Aegis air-defense ship, the Pentagon said.
   ``Installation of Aegis on a ship of the Japanese Maritime
Self-Defense Force will enhance Japanese capability to protect its
sea lines of communication,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``It is in U.S. national interests to assist Japan in meeting
these goals.''
   The proposed sale of the Aegis Combat System generated opposition
in the House earlier this year, with a small group of lawmakers
complaining about Japan's trade policies and expressing concern that
Japan might not keep the technology secret.
   That opposition has evaporated in recent weeks, however, and the
deal is now expected to win congressional blessing. Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other top Pentagon officials have
argued that theUnited States should not withhold advanced military
technology at a time when it is pressing Japan and other allies to
spend more on defense.
   The Aegis combat system was developed by the United States for
its newest line of cruisers, the so-called Ticonderoga class, but it
also is to be used on its next line of destroyers.
   Japan intends to fit the combat system to a destroyer.
   The Ticonderoga-class cruisers are considered the most
sophisticated air-defense ships in the world, featuring a unique
wrap-around radar system that allows the vessel to ``see'' in all
directions at once. The vessels also carry a large computer system
that allows the simultaneous tracking of hundreds of targets while
controlling defensive missiles and other weapons.
   The Pentagon said the prime contractor for the Aegis sale would
be the RCA Corp.'s Electronic Systems Division in Moorestown, N.J.,
and that the Navy would oversee the transaction.
   ``Implementation of this sale will require the assignment of 44
U.S. contractor representatives to Japan for approximately three
years,'' the Pentagon added.
   The other arms transactions, meantime, involve the sale of
Harpoon anti-ship missiles to South Korea; spare parts and training
services to Greece to help support three F-4 Phantom jet fighter
squadrons; and components and subassemblies for 15 UH-1H Huey
transport helicopters that will be assembled in Turkey.
   The Pentagon said the deal with South Korea would involve 52 of
the missiles and be worth an estimated $78 million. The deal with
Greece will be worth an estimated $87 million, and the deal with
Turkey an estimated $35 million.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Inaugurates Normandy Battle Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR ALLEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAEN, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand inaugurated a
museum devoted to peace Monday at the site of one of the world's
great battles, and said he hoped it would help unify Europe.
   Flanked by dignitaries, Mitterrand marked the 44th anniversary of
the D-Day invasion of Normandy by calling on world leaders to be
``masters of our history,'' united frustrating a resurgence of ``the
forces of intolerance and oppression.''
   He said the museum was intended to emphasize that unity is
essential to peace.
   ``Peace will be based not only on the superpowers but also on a
strong, independent Europe,'' he said.
   Among those at the ceremony were the first German delegation to
attend a D-Day anniversary and a multinational group of 160
schoolchildren.
   Three million men fought in the 76-day Battle of Normandy that
began June 6, 1944, and 367,000 were killed or wounded. Victory for
the Allies forced the Germans into retreat and marked a turning
point in the war.
   The glass-and-white-stone structure stands on a bluff in a suburb
of Caen, atop a bunker used as a German division headquarters during
the Allied invasion. Fractured granite lines the narrow entrance to
the spacious main hall.
   Caen, in the British sector of the invasion front, was among the
many Normandy cities leveled. The museum was the idea of Mayor
Jean-Marie Girault, who called it the crowning achievement of the
city's reconstruction.
   It contains a collection of war relics including a British
bomber, German tanks, old rifles and uniforms. The six exhibits,
assembled by a team of top French historians, seek to explain the
causes of the war rather than glorify its battles.
   World War II was the first great war fought over political
ideology, museum organizers said.
   ``Although we were fighting battles over real estate, the war was
really about ideological matters,'' said U.S. Rep. Sam Gibbons, a
Florida Democrat and member of the American delegation to the
ceremony.
   Gibbons, a captain in the 501st Parachute Infantry, dropped
behind German lines during the invasion. He is the only Normandy
veteran in Congress.
   Historians of the French Institute for the History of the
Present, who developed the exhibits, said they were intended to
balance the traditional depiction of various phases of the war in
French textbooks.
   Textbooks tend to glorify the Resistance, while skirting the role
played by the Vichy regime, collaborators and the foreign troops who
freed France, historian Denis Peschanski said.
   ``The idea of this museum is to give cause for reflection rather
than to make the traditional arguments and appeals to emotional
response,'' he said.
   Along with British, Canadian and American regular armies, the
Normandy invasion force included soldiers from Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Norway, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and
France.
   Delegations from Italy, the Soviet Union and Japan also were
present Monday, including Yoshitaka Kawamato, director of the Peace
Museum at Hiroshima, Japan, site of the first nuclear bombing.

<HEAD>Senate Again Refuses To Require Reagan To Invoke War Powers Act in
Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 54-31 Monday against requiring
President Reagan to invoke the War Powers Act and defend his Persian
Gulf policy against the restrictions of the 1973 law.
   The vote by the Democratic-controlled chamber was the latest in a
long series of inconclusive fights over whether the act applies to
Reagan's 11-month policy of protecting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers.
   The War Powers law restricts a president's right to send U.S.
military personnel to areas of ``imminent hostilities'' and would,
under some circumstances, require the personnel to be withdrawn
within 60 days or 90 days.
   Reagan, as have all his predecessors, argues that the law is an
unconstitutional restriction.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., pushed for consideration of the War
Powers issue, telling his colleagues that despite the constitutional
questions, the law should be followed until it is struck down or
changed.
   ``The question is simple,'' said Adams. ``Are we going to
recognize the facts and vote to uphold the law, or are we going to
continue to abrogate our constitutional responsibility?''
   Monday's vote was on the question of whether to consider Adams'
War Powers resolution as the pending business. His resolution would
require the law be invoked.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., noted that Reagan's policy recently has
been extended from the reflagged Kuwaiti tankers to a policy of
protecting neutral shipping in the war-torn area.
   ``This is a very inopporturne time for this issue to be reopened
in terms of what we're trying to do in the gulf,'' Warner said.
``That situation seems to be becoming more stable.''
   Adams and other critics of Reagan's policy suggested that the
United States may be drawn into the long Iran-Iraq conflict.
   There have been four different instances in which the reflagged
Kuwaiti tankers or U.S. Navy warships have been involved in military
action with Iran. The most recent occurred April 18, when Navy
planes and ships sank or damaged six Iranian vessels.
   ``This is an incredibly dangerous policy when you're on the edge
of a very dangerous war,'' Adams said.
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., defended the policy, saying that
under international law it is not an act of war to come to the aid
of neutral ships who seek help. He said that ``as a result of the
United States' firm action, we have seen a cessation of Iranian
activity.''
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., noted that the Senate has been
unable to agree on whether the War Powers Act applies. ``There seems
to be the inability by Congress to stand up to presidents,'' he
added.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and other Democratic
leaders, along with Warner, last month introduced a bill that would
overhaul the War Powers Act. Their measure would eliminate the
requirement for a withdrawal after 60 days.
   Byrd was critical of Reagan's gulf plans, but said they shouldn't
be changed now. ``The policy of escorting, of convoying, Kuwaiti
ships is not a good one, but that's the policy we're following.''
   At the same time, Byrd was also critical of the War Powers Act.
``It is an unworkable law,'' he said, because ``it robs the
president of credibility, of flexibility'' if he promises troops and
the Senate later requires their withdrawal.
   But Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said the issue was clear _ the
law should be followed. ``We have postured, and debated, and
filibustered into the early hours, but we have not done one single
thing to uphold the constitution.''

<HEAD>Summit Observer Says Soviets Let Him Leave Country Without Visa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college professor said Monday he
witnessed a sure sign of change in the Soviet Union when he lost his
visa in Moscow over the weekend, hours before his flight back to the
United States.
   To his astonishment, the authorities let William Taubman leave
without the visa, he said.
   ``The (U.S.) embassy said they had never heard of somebody
getting out of the country without a visa,'' said Taubman, an
Amherst College political science professor.
   ``But the captain of the border guard said that if I called the
embassy and the embassy called the foreign ministry and the foreign
ministry called the chief administrator of the border guards and the
KGB, and the chief administrator of the border guards and the KGB
called the airport, it might work,'' he said. ``It did.''
   Taubman has spent the last five months in the Soviet Union on an
academic exchange and observed last week's summit meeting. He spoke
to about 70 other Sovietologists at a Hampshire College conference
on U.S.-Soviet relations Monday.

<HEAD>Opposition Urges Latin Mediation In Panama Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders on Monday called on
Latin American leaders to mediate efforts to push Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega from power.
   Little indication emerged here, however, that Noriega is willing
to permit any kind of mediation that would ease him out of his
control of the military and government. He has survived internal
protests as well as substantial U.S. pressure.
   Opposition leaders told Morton Abramowitz, the deputy U.S.
secretary of state who met with them during the weekend, that they
favor mediation by ``current, not past, Latin American presidents.''
   Former presidents Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela and Daniel
Oduber of Costa Rica met last week with Panamana's acting chief
executive, Manuel Solis Palma, but the government-controlled news
media said they discussed only ``the illegal sanctions against
Panama.''
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, head of the Christian Democratic Party,
said opposition leaders would like to see Latin American mediation
because ``it would change the focus of the negotiations from a
confrontation between Noriega and the U.S. government to the real
problem, which is the confrontation between Noriega and the
Panamanian people.''
   ``We would go along with this,'' said Alfredo Ramirez of the
Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement. ``If the mediation is done
by presidents now in office.''
   As chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces, Noriega is de facto
leader of the country. He was indicted in Florida in February on
U.S. drug trafficking charges. Noriega denies the charges and has
resisted U.S. pressure aimed at making him give up power.
   Arias said Monday his party would welcome the efforts of
countries such as Guatemala, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Argentina to
try to resolve the impasse.
   ``The United States ran out of options _ other than military
intervention,'' said a leader of another political party, who
insisted on anonymity. ``Now they want to try something different.''
   The Reagan administration tried economic sanctions against
Panama, pressure on Noriega and then direct negotiations. It offered
to drop the drug indictments issued in Florida to induce the general
to leave, but Noriega has survived all pressure, aided by a core of
military and political loyalists.
   Arias said Abramowitz ``had absolutely nothing new to offer'' on
his mission here. ``He said he came to evaluate the situation
following the failure of the U.S. negotiations with Noriega,'' he
reported.
   Arias said the opposition here insists that any mediation must
lead to Noriega's departure, establishment of a new civil government
and submission of the military to civilian rule.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Monday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, saying he'll probably be differing more with the
Reagan administration as the presidential campaign continues:``As I
become the standard bearer of this party, I'm going to be saying,
without regard to current administration position, here's what
George Bush feels ... here's what my aspirations for the country
are.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, on what he expects from Jesse Jackson this fall:
``If the tables were reversed and he was on his way to the
nomination and I was the runner-up, I'd expect to be deeply
involved. ... I'd try to bring my people into this. I'd be as much
service to the ticket as I possibly could. I'm confident he will be
that kind of person.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, warning he'll take Dukakis to task at the
Democratic National Convention if the Massachusetts governor fails
to change his position on South Africa: ``If he will not bend on
that matter, we'll simply meet on the floor at Atlanta. ... The
matter needs to be resolved in the committee or in platform hearings
or on the convention floor.''

<HEAD>Two Klan Arraigned on Bomb Plot Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CALGARY, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men with links to the Ku Klux Klan
were arraigned Monday on charges of conspiring to blow up the
Calgary Jewish Center and kill a prominent Jewish businessman.
   Robert Wilhelm Hamilton, 19, and Timothy David Heggen, 29, both
of Calgary, stood mute at their arraignments and were ordered held
without bail until their next court appearance on Wednesday.
   Police said they arrested the men during an undercover operation
Friday as the suspects allegedly picked up three large bombs stashed
at a boat jetty a few blocks from the Jewish Center.
   ``Our intelligence shows the plot was to be executed very soon,''
police spokesman Len Esler said.
   Hamilton and Heggen were charged with conspiring to murder Howard
Milavsky, chairman of Trizec Corp., an international real estate
conglomerate; and conspiring to cause property damage or serious
injury with an explosive. Police also alleged the suspects also
plotted to blow up a woman's car in a revenge attack.
   ``We seized some devices _ devices that were intended to blow up
the Jewish Center, the home and the car,'' Inspector Roger Bechthold
said. ``We are not prepared to comment any further.''
   Police said the plans to bomb the Jewish Center and Milavsky's
home were motivated by anti-Semitism.
   Several right-wing groups operate in Alberta Province. Tearlach
Mac a' Phearsoin, spokesman for the Calgary Ku Klux Klan chapter,
said Hamilton and Heggen had been registered supporters but not
active members.
   Hal Joffe, president of the Calgary Jewish Community Center,
said: ``This is pure, good old neo-Nazi white supremacy.''
   Leaders of the city's 5,800 Jews said the bomb plot was the first
serious act of violence planned against Jews in Calgary.

<HEAD>Former Hutton Manager Says He Was Not Authorized To Make Large
Overdrafts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman cited for alleged wrongdoing in
former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell's 1985 report about the E.F.
Hutton check kiting scheme conceded Monday he never was authorized
to make large overdrafts.
   John M. Pearce, who formerly managed two Hutton branches,
testified that he was routinely exhorted by his superiors at Hutton
to make more money on bank interest.
   Writing checks against non-existent funds was a device encouraged
by Hutton to maximize interest profits, Pearce testified at the U.S.
District Court trial of his lawsuit against Bell.
   Bell was hired by Hutton to conduct an internal investigation
after the company pleaded guilty to 2,000 mail and wire fraud
charges in 1985.
   ``That was the firm's policy,'' Pearce said. ``I think so long as
the banks weren't injured, it was a legitimate way to do business.''
   Pearce contends he and five other branch managers were wrongly
singled out for criticism in the report that Bell issued following
his three-month investigation.
   But under questioning by Bell's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, Pearce
conceded he never received written instructions to exceed the normal
overdrafting outlined in the Hutton ``drawn-down sheet'' _ a
procedure Bell concluded was not illegal.
   ``In retrospect, I should have been considerably more suspicious
of being told of things that were not followed up in writing. I
fault myself for that,'' Pearce said.
   Pearce also acknowledged he didn't follow the company's
guidelines when calculating how much money would be overdrawn from
branch accounts.
   ``I don't know if they became totally irrelevant but they became
generally so,'' Pearce testified.
   Bell's report exonerated top Hutton officials of wrongdoing but
recommended sanctions against Pierce, five other branch managers and
three regional executives. Bell, a partner in the Atlanta law firm
of King & Spalding, charged that some top Hutton executives had
failed to properly monitor the operations of branch and regional
offices.
   Pearce contends that Bell, who was President Carter's first
attorney general, negligently ignored evidence that top Hutton
officials condoned the practice of making large overdrafts on
company accounts.
   Government investigators determined that the company gave itself
interest-free loans up to $250 million at a time by writing checks
that were not covered by funds in the accounts.
   Under the elaborate scheme, Hutton would reimburse an overdrawn
account with money from another branch before the overdrafted check
was cleared by the bank.
   In many instances, the reimbursement check was overdrawn against
a second account, which _ in turn _ was replenished with a check
from yet another Hutton account.
   ``This was something that went on in Woodies window as it were,''
Pearce said, referring to a Washington-area department store.
``There was no effort to conceal it.''
   While managing a branch in Bethesda, Md., withdrawals from the
office account were sometimes 10 times to 30 times larger than
deposits, Pearce said. The company's guidelines specified that
withdrawals should only exceed an account balance by 50 percent.
   Pearce testified that he never personally benefited from the
overdrafting.
   Pearce, who also managed Hutton's St. Louis branch, said he was
making $135,000 when he left the company. Last year he made $21,000
as president of a fire safety equipment company he owns in Sarasota,
Fla., Pearce said.
   When Bell published his findings, Pearce said: ``I was held up as
a criminal, I was finished as a manager in the securities business.''

   Thunderstorms were scattered over parts of the South on Monday
and along parts of the parched West Coast, and warm weather spread
over the Great Lakes.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms extended from the Mississippi
Delta across Florida during the afternoon.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.17 inches of rain fell
at Tampa, Fla., and 1.77 inches fell at West Palm Beach, Fla.
   Showers also were scattered along the northern half of the
Pacific Coast and thunderstorms brought winterlike temperatures,
rain and hail to the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``We keep looking at the calendar and it says June, but it's
really more like January weather,'' said National Weather Service
spokeswoman Cris Smith in Redwood City, outside San Francisco.
   The storm system extended to the Sierra Nevada, where the snow
level dropped to 5,000 feet, she said.
   Farther inland, a freeze advisory was issued overnight for
northern and central Nevada.
   Warm air with morning temperatures in the 70s and 80s moved as
far north as the upper Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley,
the Dakotas and eastern Montana, which had three days of record heat
over the weekend.
   Record highs for the date Monday included 95 at Alpena, Mich.; 93
at Flint, Mich.; 93 at Green Bay, Wis.; and 96 at Williston, N.D.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36 at
Truckee, Calif., to 98 at Williston, N.D. The low for the day was 22
at Truckee.
   For Tuesday, showers were forecast over the Florida Peninsula,
and from the northern two-thirds of the Pacific Coast across eastern
Washington, and along the New England coast.
   High in the 50s and 60s were predicted over New England and
interior New York state, and from the Idaho Panhandle across
northern Nevada, from the northern third of California across
Washigton, and along the southern coast of California; in the upper
80s and the 90s over the Virginias, the Carolinas, the Ohio Valley,
the Tennessee Valley, much of the Mississippi Valley, and the
Plains; near 100 across the desert Southwest and southwestern Texas;
and in the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>ABC Poll Puts Dukakis Ahead of Jackson by 2-1 in California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis has stretched his advantage
over Jesse Jackson in the California Democratic primary to a 2-1
margin, an ABC News tracking poll indicated Monday.
   The survey had Dukakis with 61 percent support among likely
voters in the Tuesday contest and Jackson with 30 percent. That
represented a slight gain for Dukakis and a slight drop in Jackson's
support during the weekend.
   The results were based on 415 telephone interviews Saturday and
Sunday. Dukakis' support had been 56 percent in two-day poll
averages since Wednesday and Thursday; Jackson went from 36 percent
to 34, 32, then to 30 percent.
   Four percent backed former candidate Sen. Albert Gore Jr. in the
latest poll, 4 percent picked someone else and 2 percent were
undecided. The poll had a margin of sampling error of about 6
percentage points.
   ``It seems very stable. Two-thirds of whites plan to vote
Dukakis; only 21 percent of whites are for Jackson,'' said Jeff
Alderman, polling director for ABC. ``Dukakis leads Jackson in all
demographic groups except blacks.''
   Even among blacks, Dukakis appeared to be doing better than in
earlier races. He was supported by nearly a quarter of blacks in the
Saturday-Sunday poll, up from 15 percent in the earlier ABC averages
and considerably better than his showing among blacks in earlier
primaries, Alderman said.
   Because of the imprecision in tracking polls, it was not clear
whether that finding would hold, Alderman said. He noted that
Jackson's supporters, as usual, supported him more strongly than
Dukakis voters backed their man.
   Latinos, a sizable voting group in California, supported Dukakis
in the poll over Jackson by a 3-2 margin, Alderman said.

<HEAD>Pentagon, NASA Officials OK Plan To Restore Production Capacity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department and NASA have approved a
plan to restore and actually expand private industry's capacity to
produce an important rocket fuel ingredient, government sources said
Monday.
   The plan involves a series of guarantees for annual purchases and
the payment of capital construction ``surcharges'' to the Kerr-McGee
Corp. and the Pacific Engineering Products of Nevada for the solid
fuel ingredient ammonium perchlorate, said the officials, who agreed
to discuss the matter only if not identified.
   The plan is aimed at allowing Pacific Engineering to rebuild its
production plant, which was completely leveled by a massive
explosion on May 4, and at encouraging Kerr-McGee to expand the
capacity of its existing plant by up to 50 percent, said the
officials.
   Ultimately, the plan might even be expanded to entice one or more
other companies to enter the business, they said.
   The main points of the plan were approved last Friday by Robert
B. Costello, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, and by top
officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
sources said.
   It was discussed with top leaders on Capitol Hill on Monday.
   The Pacific Engineering plant in Henderson, Nev., represented
about 50 percent of the nation's production capacity for ammonium
perchlorate, a rocket fuel oxidizer that is essential not only for
NASA's space shuttle but also for a variety of military missiles,
including the MX and Minuteman missiles.
   Government officials warned last month that if the lost capacity
is not quickly restored, both the Pentagon and NASA could face
slowdowns in their space-launching schedules.
   The sources refused Monday to provide any estimates of how much
the plan would cost the government, saying the Pentagon probably
would have more to say on the matter later this week.
   The officials did say, however, the plan avoids any commitment of
taxpayer money ``up front,'' instead committing the government to
pay a special surcharge over a five-to-seven-year period on its
ammonium perchlorate purchases. The surcharge would allow the two
companies to quickly recover plant construction costs, the sources
said.
   The plan envisions Pacific Engineering essentially restoring all
of its lost capacity by building a new plant that could produce
about 40 million pounds per year, the sources said.
   Kerr McGee would expand its existing plant, which can produce
about 40 million pounds per year, to allow production of another 20
million pounds, the officials continued.
   The government also would provide the two companies with
guarantees that it would purchase a minimum of 20 million pounds
from each of them each year, the sources said.
   The combination of authorized surcharges and a purchase guarantee
is expected to make it extremely easy for both companies _ but
particularly Pacific Engineering _ to line up the financing needed
to quickly build new facilities.
   The sources said the purchase guarantees of 20 million pounds per
year from each company is actually somewhat less than what the
government has been buying in recent years. Thus the significance of
that part of the plan is simply that a formal commitment would be
made to reassure lending institutions, said one official.

   They have flown in from around America, each
filling two airline seats, to lose weight and call attention to Dick
Gregory's call for ``a national war on obesity.''
   They are a dozen very fat people, from 268 to 600 pounds, to whom
Gregory has offered a free last chance to lose weight _ a service
the comedian-turned-nutritionist says the government should be
rendering.
   ``I never knew this kind of obesity exists,'' Gregory said Monday
as he welcomed some arrivals at LaGuardia Airport. ``I'm saying the
government has to come in and get involved.''
   Since the case of Walter Hudson, one of several highly publicized
obese people who have lost weight under Gregory's guidance, ``A
group of invisible fat people have become visible and they're all
calling me,'' Gregory said.
   He said obesity is ``a much bigger problem than drug addiction.
If obese people started robbing and killing, then we'd find the
money to help them.''
   Gregory's charges include Ron Miller, 523 pounds, who says his
eating is a sickness, and Barbara Peebles-Smith, who weighs about
half as much but says she wants to be able to cross her legs
``without feeling like I'm going to have a heart attack.''
   Some have tried Overeaters Anonymous, Weight Watchers, and a
variety of diets. Two have had their stomachs stapled, one had
placenta injections, and one was injected with the urine of a
pregnant woman.
   The dozen will spend at least a year at a clinic Gregory is
opening in upstate New York. They will be placed on a herbal diet
and exercise routine devised by Gregory.
   Gregory said the treatment program would cost him hundreds of
thousands of dollars. He said part of the tab would be covered by
his successful nutritional food business.
   Gregory said he chose these obese people because they had ``the
saddest stories'' and because they seemed healthy enough to diet
safely.
   ``Some talked about suicide,'' he said. ``One lady said she
prayed she could get cancer. I thought it was so she could die. She
said it was so she could get thin.''
   Gregory said the federal government should establish ``an
institute on obesity'' and a clearing house for information on the
problem. He also called for a congressional investigation of what he
termed ``this national American health crisis,'' and promised to
begin a ``40-day fast and prayer vigil for the obese of our nation.''
   Peebles-Smith, a 40-year-old Norfolk, Va., resident, told New
York Newsday that she was entering the clinic ``for my kids, because
I want to live longer.''
   Miller, a chef until he slipped and injured himself three years
ago, said people ``don't understand that eating is a sickness and
you can't stop.''
   Among Monday's arrivals was Michael Parteleno, 30, an activities
director at a nursing home in Youngstown, Ohio. Parteleno said he
weighs 758 pounds, more than 200 pounds less than when he went on a
diet prescribed by Gregory. He said he hoped to drop to 190 pounds
over two years.
   Gregory has engaged in two other highly publicized weight
reduction campaigns.
   In 1986 he helped Ron High of Brooklyn, who weighed 850 pounds,
lose more than 500 pounds. Last year he took up the case of Walter
Hudson, a Long Island man who weighed 1,200 pounds. Hudson lost 400
pounds under Gregory's care and diet, but they parted company
earlier this year after Hudson refused to leave his home and check
into Gregory's health spa in the Bahamas.

<HEAD>Reagan Praises Civil Rights Chief As Apostle of Justice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission chairman who fought against affirmative action, was
remembered Monday by President Reagan as a ``leading apostle of a
just and color-blind society.''
   Pendleton, 57, one of the Reagan administration's highest-ranking
blacks, collapsed and died Sunday of an apparent heart attack while
exercising at a health club in San Diego, where he lived.
   Funeral services for Pendleton, who had suffered a heart attack
in 1976 and battled high blood pressure, were scheduled Wednesday at
St. Paul's Cathedral in San Diego, a family spokeswoman said Monday.
   Pendleton drew bitter criticism during his 6{-year tenure as
commission chairman for opposing civil rights policies such as
racial quotas and busing in conformance with Reagan's stance.
   ``Yesterday, with the sudden death of Clarence Pendleton, America
lost a leading apostle of a just and color-blind society,'' Reagan
said in a statement. ``Clarence Pendleton early in life took up the
banner of equal rights for all Americans and boldly carried the
banner forward.''
   Reagan also invoked the memory of slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. in praising the man he called ``Penny.''
   Pendleton leaves behind a confidence ``that one day all Americans
will be judged not by stereotypes and prejudices, but on their own
merits, qualifications, performance _ as Penny often quoted Martin
Luther King Jr., `Not ... by the color of their skin but by the
content of their character.'''
   No autopsy will be performed, Deputy Coroner Jack Larkie said,
adding that Pendleton's physician would identify the cause of death.
Deputy Coroner David Lodge said it appeared he had suffered a heart
attack.
   Friends and acquaintances remembered Pendleton as a dedicated
public servant and principled man.
   John E. Jacob, president and chief executive of the National
Urban League, said, ``Despite our very forceful disagreement about
key issues affecting black Americans, I respected his right to those
opinions, as he respected my right to differ.
   ``He was a good friend and a formidable adversary.''
   ``He had a lot of courage and took stands, sometimes, that
weren't very popular,'' said San Diego police Chief Bill Kolender,
who had known Pendleton for 15 years.
   But San Diego County Supervisor Leon Williams called Pendleton an
``embarrassment'' to blacks.
   ``I don't know any black people who thought his positions were
admirable,'' said Williams, who is black.
   In November 1981, Reagan appointed Pendleton as commission
chairman to replace the fired Arthur S. Flemming, who had criticized
the administration's civil rights policies as ``in conflict with the
Constitution.''
   The bipartisan commission is an advisory body that monitors
enforcement of civil rights laws within the federal government. It
lacks policy-making or enforcement powers.
   Pendleton maintained that equal treatment _ not special
preferences _ should form the basis for federal civil rights
policies.
   He once termed the concept of comparable worth, which envisions
women receiving the same salary as men with similar jobs, ``the
looniest idea since `Looney Tunes.''' He called affirmative action
``divisive, unpopular and immoral,'' and opposed busing.
   He also criticized the Civil Rights Restoration Act, passed
earlier this year over Reagan's veto, as ``an unwarranted invasion
... by Big Brother.''
   His views made him a lightening rod for criticism of the Reagan's
administration's approach to civil rights enforcement.
   In July 1986, congressional critics unsuccessfully tried to
replace the commission with a new Office of Civil Rights Assessment,
accusing the commission under Pendleton of becoming a ``political
instrument of the executive branch.''
   Pendleton dismissed the move and said it ``simply reflects the
political differences'' between some members of Congress and the
commission majority.
   Pendleton was alone when he collapsed Sunday morning in the
exercise room of the San Diego Hilton Beach and Tennis Resort, said
Gary Lingley, director of the hotel's tennis club. Pendleton had
attended regularly since joining the club several months ago.
   Pendleton, an avid jogger and swimmer, once taught physical
education in college and worked as a government recreation director
in Washington, and Baltimore before being named director of the
Model Cities Department in San Diego in 1972. He was president of
the Urban League in San Diego from 1975 until 1982.
   Pendleton graduated from Howard University in 1954 and after
serving in the Army he returned to earn a masters' degree in
education.
   Pendleton's is survived by his wife, Margrit, and their daughter,
Paula, as well as by two grown children from a previous marriage who
live in Washington, D.C.

   Two blue-collar workers, one of whom
could find no one to share his bet, were catapulted to fame and
wealth Monday when they split North America's largest lottery
jackpot, $51.4 million.
   Aircraft mechanic Shelby Carroll, 53, of Vacaville, and
Sacramento supermarket clerk Randy Pennington, 26, will each receive
$25.7 million over 20 years, lottery officials said.
   At a news conference, the Lotto 6-49 winners said they both used
a feature of the lottery terminals that randomly selects ticket
numbers for the player. They said they have few immediate plans
except to quit their jobs and help family members in various ways.
   Both also told a crowd of reporters and cheering lottery workers
that they would be ready for an onslaught of strangers interested in
their windfalls from the Saturday drawing.
   Carroll, a mechanic at Travis Air Force Base, said he was
unsuccessful in finding someone to match $50 with his $50, then
split any winnings from the $100 in bets.
   ``I asked my boss...if he would like to share with me. I said,
`Give me $50 and we'll split the winnings.' At the time, it (the
jackpot) was around $40 million. He says, `No.' I asked a couple
more of the guys, and they said, `No.'''
   So Carroll bet $100 himself because, he said, ``I had a feeling.''
   How does he feel now about not finding a partner? ``I'm glad. I
feel sorry for them. But I'm glad.''
   Pennington said that after buying his tickets, ``I found a
heads-up penny. Every time I've ever found a heads up penny,
somethings always happened good to me. I'm superstitious, I guess.''
   Asked if he had been hoping to get the whole jackpot himself,
Pennington told the crowd of about 100: ``Honest to God, I was
hoping that somebody else hit it, too, because I didn't want all
this by myself.''
   Pennington said that with the money, he would have more time to
indulge his hobby of collecting antique toys.
   Being single, he was asked if he had any trouble getting dates.
Replied Pennington, ``No. But who wants dates now. I don't.''
   The odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in
14 million, said lottery officials. The winning numbers were 48, 42,
9, 14, 19, 31. Tickets cost $1 each.
   The $51.4 million jackpot was revised downward from the original
estimate of nearly $52.24 million, after lottery officials completed
the final tally of ticket sales.
   Each grand prize winner will get $1,028,000 annually, after
taxes, for 20 years.
   The winners' award culminated several days of frenzied lotto
playing, during which the bettors purchased up to $4 million worth
of tickets an hour.
   Saturday's sales alone totaled more than $33 million, a one-day
record, spokesman Bob Taylor said. Weekly sales normally average
about $23 million, officials said.
   The late rush pumped millions of extra dollars into the grand
prize pot before sales were halted at 7:45 p.m. Saturday, 13 minutes
before the drawing.
   A $46 million jackpot in Pennsylvania was awarded in October and
was the previous record for a North American lottery payoff. The
biggest previous California jackpot, $25.4 million, was split by two
players in October.

<TEXT>
   The army reopened high
schools Monday for 36,000 students in the occupied West Bank and
freed more than 100 Palestinian teen-agers from jail so they could
attend classes.
   Military officials said opening the schools signaled a waning of
the rebellion that began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians
in the occupied lands. Schools had been closed since February.
   But students said they would continue to demonstrate against the
Israeli occupation.
   ``It's good to be back in school because without being educated
we can't be liberated,'' said Ranna Bahu, 17, a senior at Friends
Girls School in the West Bank city of Ramallah. `We can continue
demonstrating after we take our classes, but education has to also
be a priority.''
   Also Monday, a 9-month-old girl, Fidah Sharafi, was hit in the
left eye by a rubber bullet during a protest at the Jabaliya refugee
camp, officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said. Israel radio
said the girl lost sight in the eye.
   Army spokesmen said soldiers treated a 9-month-old girl who was
injured when soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters in
Jabaliya. Arab reports said Suad Sharaf, 17, was struck in the mouth
by a bullet.
   In Hebron in the West Bank, students burned tires and threw
stones at troops outside Hussein High School, an Arab reporter said.
Hospital officials said a youth was grazed by a bullet fired by
soldiers.
   In the nearby Dheisheh refugee camp, a 16-year-old boy was
wounded when troops pursued stone-throwers, Israel radio reported.
Army sources said he was wounded when a soldier fired accidentally.
   The radio also reported that two firebombs were thrown at an
Israeli bus in the Arab east Jerusalem. No injuries were reported
but the bus was damaged.
   Meanwhile, Richard Schifter, U.S. assistant secretary of state
for human rights, and U.S. ambassador Thomas Pickering toured the
occupied territories Monday.
   They spent two hours with army commanders in the Gaza Strip,
discussing the army rules on detention, curfews and use of live
ammunition and allegations of brutality against soldiers, Israel
radio reported.
   ``We had a very useful talk here and we will be continuing the
talks,'' Pickering said on the radio.
   Pickering and Schifter also visited military administration
headquarters in the West Bank and discussed human rights policy with
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   Yitzhak Artzi, a legislator with the left-leaning Labor Party,
said Rabin told him some of the 2,061 Palestinians jailed for six
months without trial or charges could be released.
   An Israeli officer, Lt. Giora Even-Tzur, was jailed for allegedly
pelting rocks May 18 at three Arabs placed handcuffed into stone
pits outside the West Bank village of Arura, the daily Yediot
Ahronot reported.
   The army was also investigating allegations against an Israeli
brigade commander accused of shooting an Arab shepherd to death
during a helicopter chase near the West Bank village of Bani Naim,
the newspaper said.
   The complaint, brought by left-wing legislator Matti Peled, was
based on information from troops who witnessed the April 4 incident,
Yediot said.
   Also, the daily Haaretz quoted a military spokesman as saying the
army was experimenting with a new aluminum bullet to replace steel
bullets used to quell violent protests. The newspaper said the new
bullet is less likely to cause serious injuries.
   Since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8, 201 Palestinians have been
killed, most of them by Israeli army gunfire. Two Israelis have died.
   In the first two months of demonstrations, schools were a major
center of protest. West Bank schools were closed, and schools in the
Gaza Strip had operated on-and-off.
   The army cited a reduction in violence when it reopened grade
schools and junior high schools over the past two weeks and resumed
high school classes Monday.
   ``We are very happy today. We had approximately 90 percent
attendance, nearly everybody was in class,'' said Olivier Rafowicz,
spokesman for the West Bank military government. ``It proves
everybody wants to go back to normal life.''
   But students and teachers said returning to school did not mean
demonstrations would cease in the territories Israel captured in the
1967 Middle East war.
   ``We're going to keep studying and demonstrating, both,'' said
Ghanam Abdul Khader Taha, 15, of Ramallah High School.
   ``It's not the Israelis who are responsible for the students
being back in school. If the PLO hadn't sanctioned it, they would
not be here,'' said Olga Hawid, a 12th-grade French and Arabic
teacher at the school.

Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab
announced Monday the appointment of an ombudsman to advise innocent
people who become entangled in its ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug
program.
   Janet L. Labunda has been assigned to help boat owners and other
individuals avoid unnecessary legal expenses resulting from the
zero-tolerance program, he said.
   ``I want to emphasize that this appointment does not mean we are
backing off zero tolerance one bit,'' von Raab said in making the
announcement.
   ``We are concerned about the small number of innocent people who
are unfortunate to be unwittingly associated with criminal
activity,'' he added.
   Boat owners and civil libertarians last month angrily criticized
the policy when the owner of the $2.5 million yacht Ark Royal had to
pay $1,600 in fines and fees after the service seized the vessel
because a small amount of marijuana was found. The marijuana
allegedly was taken aboard by a crewman.
   The private yacht Monkey Business _ known widely as the boat on
which former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart and model
Donna Rice spent a weekend with friends _ was seized outside the
U.S. 12-mile territorial limit on May 14 when a marijuana cigarette
was found aboard. Eight ounces of the drug later were found on the
vessel.
   The government later refined its procedures to seize vessels
outside the 12-mile limit only when there was evidence that the boat
was being used for drug trafficking.
   Since the government instituted the zero-tolerance policy March
21, more than 1,000 arrests have been made and more than 1,500
vessels have been seized, Customs said.

   The government praised the Russian
Orthodox Church on Monday in a message to religious leaders who met
here to mark 1,000 years of Christianity in what is now the Soviet
Union.
   Official Radio Moscow said the message ``describes the
introduction of Christianity as a major event in the nation's
history and in the development of Russia's statehood and culture.''
   In Moscow, meanwhile, more than 50 religious dissidents crowded
into an apartment for an alternate service to emphasize restrictions
the government and church place on their religious lives.
   The four-day Local Council conference in Zagorsk, a medieval
center 40 miles northeast of Moscow that includes a monastery and
seminary, will name nine new saints and consider internal church
business, church officials said.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the
Church of England, representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, and
dozens of officials from Eastern and Western churches entered
Trinity-St. Sergius accompanied by the pealing of bells.
   Hundreds of Soviet citizens crowded around iron fences under a
hot morning sun to watch the procession.
   Journalists were not allowed into the conference. According to
Radio Moscow, the government's message said ``The unity of people,
irrespective of their attitude to religion, is essential to further
progress toward a society of social justice.''
   It urged the church to continue working for peace and ``foster
the humanitarian and moral potential of the nation,'' Radio Moscow
said.
   Included among the saints to be canonized are Russia's most
famous icon painter, Andrei Rublev, and Dmitri Donskoy, a 14th
century nobleman who defeated the Tatars in two major battles.
   Church documents said the conference also would consider an
administrative charter for the church and discuss its activities on
behalf of world peace.
   At the apartment in south Moscow, seven Russian Orthodox priests
barred from serving in parishes conducted a service for people who
came from many areas of the Soviet Union, dissident Alexander
Ogorodnikov said.
   He said the purpose was to demonstrate that the priests ``are
part of the life of the church despite the view of authorities.''
   Pentecostalists and Baptists also attended the service, he said.

   Singer Ricky Skaggs fled his dressing
room and changed clothes in a restroom to get some privacy Monday
night before the 22nd annual Music City News country music awards
show.
   ``I didn't want to dress in front of other people's wives,'' he
said, while shaving and dressing in a restroom backstage at the
Grand Ole Opry House. Skaggs shared a dressing room with other male
performers.
   About a half-dozen people were in the restroom.
   Skaggs is known for hits such as ``Country Boy'' and ``Highway 40
Blues.'' He and his wife, Sharon, sang on the awards show.

   Victoria Sellers, the daughter of the late
actor Peter Sellers, on Monday admitted using cocaine in violation
of probation terms set in an earlier drug distribution case.
   Ms. Sellers, 23, admitted diluting urine samples by drinking lots
of fluids, failing to appear for tests and leaving the district
without probation approval, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary
Lincenberg. In a federal court hearing, she pleaded guilty to
probation violation, and will be sentenced June 27, the prosecutor
said.
   Ms. Sellers, of Los Angeles, had been ordered to undergo periodic
testing for drugs as a condition of her three-year probation. She
was sentenced in March 1987 after pleading guilty to concealing a
crime in a New Jersey drug conspiracy case.
   ``Right now she is being tested every day, according to the
probation officer,'' Lincenberg said.
   As part of a plea bargain, the former Playboy model and actress
testified against other defendants who allegedly ran a violent, Los
Angeles-based cocaine ring headed by Reed Wallace, her talent agent
and housemate.
   A Newark, N.J. judge also ordered her to perform 600 hours of
community service and fined her $500.
   The U.S. Probation Office has indicated it will recommend Ms.
Sellers be treated at a drug rehabilitation program, and ``we would
concur with that recommendation,'' Lincenberg said.
   Ms. Sellers, a British citizen and daughter of actress Britt
Ekland, already has spent time in a rehabilitation program at St.
John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Lincenberg said.
   ``It obviously didn't work,'' he said.

   India on Tuesday plans to begin
withdrawing some of the troops it sent to Sri Lanka to enforce a
peace accord that so far has failed to stop the 5-year-old Tamil
separatist war, military officials said.
   An Indian Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Monday that at least 3,000 of the 50,000 Indian soldiers in Sri
Lanka would be sent home on Tuesday.
   Sri Lankan officers, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the departing troops would take part in a farewell ceremony in
Trincomalee, an eastern port.
   Meanwhile, two men suspected of being Tamil militants shot the
Rev. Chandra Fernando to death in the eastern port of Batticaloa, an
associate of the Roman Catholic priest reported.
   Fernando was president of the Batticaloa Citizens Committee, a
volunteer group that charts human rights abuses in the war.
   India began sending peacekeeping forces on July 30, a day after
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Junius R. Jayewardene, president of
Sri Lanka, signed a peace accord they hoped would end the war that
has cost more than 8,000 lives.
   Rebels were not involved in negotiating the treaty, which
required them to lay down their arms in return for more autonomy in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where ethnic Tamils predominate.
   The largest insurgent group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
rejected the treaty and has continued fighting. It wants an
independent Tamil homeland in the north and east to be called Eelam.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
most are Hindus, the main religion among India's 800 million people.
They claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese, a predominantly
Buddhist ethnic group that controls the government and military.
   India became involved because it is the region's dominant power
and has about 60 million Tamils in its southern Tamil Nadu state.
   Its soldiers began an offensive in October against the Tigers on
the northern Jaffna Peninsula, their main stronghold, and drove them
from the region.
   For the past two weeks, the Indians have been sweeping jungles
around Mullaitivu, an eastern port, for more Tigers bases.
   Indian news reports have said most of the equipment being
withdrawn was used in the Jaffna offensive and is no longer needed
for the search-and-destroy operations now being conducted.

   As the world remembers Robert F. Kennedy 20 years
after his death his widow says she is getting through this difficult
time by trying to focus on the ``wonderful part ... to remember what
he stood for.''
   In an interview broadcast Monday on ``NBC Nightly News,'' Ethel
Kennedy declined to speculate what Kennedy would think about today's
political climate, but she said anyone who had been around her
husband and knew how he felt would believe ``things could be a lot
better now.''
   Still, Mrs. Kennedy said in the interview taped Saturday at her
Virginia home, ``I think a lot of people have made some sacrifices
in their lives to make it a better world ... and in a lot of ways it
is.''
   While Kennedy was a passionate man with intense beliefs, Mrs.
Kennedy said he never preached to his children.
   ``Probably that's why he had such a tremendous influence on the
children. He never tried to impose his world view on them,'' she
said. `` He did it by example ... he brought us all along with his
enthusiasm ... his love of life ... his curiosity and he made
everybody feel a part of this battle, that we're going to do better,
that America can stand for something.''
   Kennedy, then a senator from New York, was fatally shot in Los
Angeles on June 5, 1968, while campaigning for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Thousands of people were expected to attend a memorial ceremony
Monday night at the Kennedy grave in Arlington National Cemetery in
Arlington, Va.

   The killing of a 4-year-old girl by an alligator
triggered a rash of reports of the reptiles near homes in Florida,
and a wildlife officer said Monday he's now quicker to fulfill
requests to have the animals killed.
   Meanwhile, another wildlife official warned people not to take
vigilante action against the usually harmless animals after a report
that a woman living near the site where the girl was killed attacked
a small alligator.
   Lt. Dick Lawrence of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission said he's stopped trying to explain to people complaining
about alligators that attacks by the animals are extremely rare.
   ``Extremely rare doesn't mean a damn thing with what happened
this weekend,'' said Lawrence, alligator coordinator for the game
commission in a 10-county Everglades region.
   Lawrence, who issues permits to have state-designated trappers
kill troublesome alligators, said his office received 80 complaints
about alligators Monday, four or five times the normal number,
following the death Saturday of young Erin Glover in Englewood.
   The child was splashing through shallow water along the shore of
a lake near her home when a 10{-foot alligator grabbed her. Her
31-pound body was recovered more than five hours later after game
officers shot and killed the alligator.
   ``When people see an alligator, especially now, all they see is
the mouthful of teeth and ugliness,'' Lawrence said.
   ``I think there'll be more permits issued, but the kills may not
go up. The trapper may go out there in a day or two, and the gator's
not there.''
   Game officials received a report Monday that a woman living near
the site of the fatal attack ``bashed a 3-foot gator's head in,''
said game commission Lt. Jim Farrior. Officials could not confirm
the report.
   Farrior said alligators that small eat only minnows, frogs and
snakes, and he cautioned people against taking violent action
against gators.
   ``I think the vigilante response is not a good response. It's
ineffective,'' he said. ``You can't go out on a rampage and start
killing every gator out there.''
   Wildlife officials will not change their policy for handling
nuisance alligators, Farrior said. They will kill alligators more
than 4 feet long if they are aggressive toward people, pets or
livestock or show a lack of fear toward humans.
   Lawrence said people who live near ponds, canals and lakes need
not panic if they spot an alligator.
   Including Erin's death, alligators have killed six people and
engaged in 95 unprovoked attacks in Florida since 1948, according to
game commission statistics.
   ``Generally, if you leave alligators alone, they'll leave you
alone,'' he said.
   Franklin Percival, wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Gainesville, said people probably were
overreacting to Erin's death, but he added that it's important to
respect alligators.
   ``You're just really asking for it when you're dealing with a
wild animal at close range. You have to keep your distance,'' he
said.
   Alligators have been a protected species in Florida since the
mid-1960s, when their population dwindled after years of vigorous
hunting.
   But in recent years their population has rebounded dramatically,
with state wildlife experts estimating there are 1 million
alligators on 6.7 million acres. On Sept. 1, for the first time
since 1962, the state will hold a one-month gator hunt in which up
to 3,000 will be taken.

   Arab leaders began arriving here Monday
for a summit that a PLO official said will help determine the
direction of the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation
Organization, spoke to reporters following his arrival in Algiers
with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for the extraordinary three-day
summit that begins Tuesday.
   He said the meeting will be very important in determining the
course of the six-month-old Palestinian insurrection in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The Americans are not recognizing the Palestinians' legitimate
rights to self-determination and the establishment of an independent
state,'' he said. ``This is why all the proposals put by America are
born dead.''
   Sharif said political support for the rioting should include a
unified stand against the latest U.S. peace initiative and a
reiteration of ``their endorsement of the PLO as the sole,
legitimate representative of the (5 million) Palestinian people,
inside and outside the occupied territories.''
   Arafat, wearing green fatigues and with a pistol on his hip, was
the first leader to arrive for the summit convened to back the
anti-Israeli riots and to unify positions on the U.S. Middle East
initiative.
   Underscoring Arafat's participation as a key player, President
Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria accorded him a warm, official welcome at
the airport, as if Arafat were a full-fledged chief of state. A
young Algerian girl gave Arafat a bouquet of flowers.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia; King Hussein of Jordan; Sheik Zayed
Bin Sultan an-Nahyan, the president of the United Arab Emirates, and
President Sid Ahmen Ould Taya of Mauritania flew in after Arafat.
   The other arrivals were expected to continue into Tuesday.
   The summit of all 21 members of the Arab League was convened by
Bendjedid essentially to strengthen Arab support and financial
backing for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, territories taken from Jordan and Egypt by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Attention was sure to be riveted on Fahd, leader of the richest
Arab nation, to see if he will substantially increase the Saudi
subsidy for the uprising.
   ``Ideally, we would like to see the intefadeh (uprising )
transformed into a (Mahatma) Gandhi-style civil disobedience
campaign,'' said a senior PLO official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``But that means about $10 million a day to compensate
for loss of income and feed the people.''
   Yasser Abed Rabbo, a member of the PLO's 15-man executive
committee, said the main PLO goal at the summit was to draw a
``clear-cut, unequivocal stand toward the United States and (U.S.
Secretary of State George) Shultz's plan.''
   Shultz was in Damascus Monday on his fourth attempt to persuade
Syrian President Hafez Assad to support his plan, which calls for
limited Palestinian self-rule to be followed by an international
conference.
   The plan excludes PLO participation in the parley. It also makes
no mention of a Palestinian state, for which the Arabs have been
struggling.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafy, whose personal participation was
still in doubt Monday night, has said he wants the summit to keep
strictly to the sole item on its agenda, the Palestinian uprising.

<HEAD>Vietnam Would Withdraw Troops From Cambodia On Political Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam
told the General Assembly on Monday that his government will
withdraw all its soldiers from Cambodia before 1990 if a political
settlement can be reached.
   At a special session on disarmament, he repeated a government
statement that half of the troops, about 50,000 men, will be
withdrawn this year and by 1990 all soldiers will have left Cambodia.
   ``If a political solution on Kampuchea (Cambodia) can be
achieved, Vietnamese forces will withdraw totally from Kampuchea in
accordance with the provisions of the agreement signed,'' Co Thach
said in a speech that was regarded as one of moderation and
conciliation.
   Vietnam invaded neighboring Cambodia in late 1978 and maintained
about 140,000 troops there, but it has been withdrawing or rotating
troops since 1982. Both nations are communist.
   ``We wish for a speedy political solution to the Kampuchean
question,'' Co Thach said, ``On the basis of respect for the
Kampuchean people's right to self-determination, termination of all
foreign interference and definitive prevention of any possible
return of the genocidal and war-mongering Pol Pot regime.''
   Pol Pot led the pro-Chinese, Khmer Rouge communist government in
Cambodia. The present government in Phnom Penh, backed by Vietnam
and the Soviet Union, has been battling a three-party coalition that
includes the forces of former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge, and the non-communist forces of former
Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann.
   The General Assembly repeatedly has rejected the legitimacy of
the Vietnam-installed government in Cambodia and recognizes the
coalition as the legitimate government at the United Nations.
   Co Thach noted that the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have
been victims for 40 years of successive protracted wars which used
the largest amount of bombs and ammunition in history.

   Three gunmen believed to be Basque
separatists fatally shot the owner of a discotheque Monday evening
in this town near San Sebastian, police reported.
   Police quoted witnesses as saying Patxi Zabaleta, 40, was shot
down while walking in the street.
   Police said they believed the killing was the work of the
separatist group ETA, whose initials stand for ``Basque land and
liberty'' in the Basque language.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for the deaths of three policemen,
a retired general and a restaurant owner so far this year. Since it
began operating in 1968, the organization has claimed more than 600
deaths in its campaign for an independent nation in Spain's northern
Basque provinces.

   About 5,000 people joined the Kennedy
family Monday at the grave of Robert F. Kennedy for a sunset ``Mass
in joyful remembrance'' of the senator who was slain 20 years ago
while savoring victory in the California presidential primary.
   This was the first time since Kennedy's death that his family
opened to the public its annual memorial service at Arlington
National Cemetery. The graveside service was not far from where his
brother, John F. Kennedy, the 35th president, is buried.
   Ethel Kennedy, the senator's widow, and their 10 surviving
children took part in the service. One of those children, Rory
Elizabeth Kennedy, was not born until six months after her father
was assassinated at the age of 42.
   By the time the service began, the steep hillside under the
Custis-Lee Mansion was crowded with friends, former campaign aides
and tourists who happened to be in the cemetery. Lt. Col. Robert
Mirelson, deputy public affairs officer for the Military District of
Washington, estimated attendance at 5,000.
   As the service ended with the singing of the Battle Hymn of the
Republic, the people on the hillside lighted candles they had been
given on their way to the grave site, bathing the scene in a soft
glow.
   ``Robert Kennedy was always ready to stop and reach out to
others,'' said Joseph P. Kennedy II, the eldest son who is a
congressman from Massachusetts. ``Now, 20 years after his death, my
mother, my brothers and sisters, all of us in our family share with
countless others across America and abroad those precious moments of
his public life.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Robert's younger brother, recited the
prayer of St. Francis: ``Lord, make me an instrument of your peace
... for it is in pardoning that we are forgiven.''
   Robert, a 34-year-old son who bears his father's name, asked the
crowd for a moment's prayer for a policeman who was struck by a
motorist as the Kennedy motorcade headed toward the service.
   Two bowls of white flowers graced the altar while a box in front
of the altar held 400 to 500 pink roses.
   Each of the Kennedy children and a few of Kennedy's grandchildren
recited during the service, some quoting from speeches their father
made, others from the Scripture.
   Matthew Kennedy welcomed the celebrants to the Mass on behalf of
his mother, sisters and brothers and said, ``I invite you to join us
in renewing the commitment that was his life, his spirit and his
hope.''
   Courtney Kennedy Ruhe quoted from a speech that the former
senator gave during the Oregon primary campaign in 1968 a week
before he was assassinated.
   ``Perhaps this world will always be a world in which children
suffer,'' she recited. ``But we can reduce the number of suffering
children and if you don't help us, who will?''
   And John F. Kennedy Jr., the only son of the president, recited
Shakespearean words Robert Kennedy liked to quote: ``When he shall
die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the
face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with
night, and pay no worship to the garish sun.''
   The gathering included some important names from the Kennedy era,
such as Ted Sorensen, a top aide and biographer to both Kennedy
brothers, and Byron White, a Supreme Court justice who was appointed
by John F. Kennedy. Neither Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis nor her
daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, attended the service.
   The memorial Mass was in the evening, as was Robert Kennedy's
burial. The reason then was the large and grieving crowds that
slowed the train carrying his coffin from New York after a service
in St. Patrick's Cathedral. The funeral was four hours late and in
the darkness, children held lighted candles.
   Now the late hour was set to accommodate close friends and others
who wanted to share the memory with his family.
   Robert Kennedy, then a senator from New York and running for the
Democratic presidential nomination, was fatally shot in Los Angeles
shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, following a brief speech at
a hotel to 2,000 campaign supporters who were celebrating his
California primary victory the previous evening. He died the
following day.
   His last words to those cheering supporters were ``it's on to
Chicago and let's win there.'' Chicago was the site of the 1968
Democratic National Convention.
   Sirhan Sirhan, the Jordanian-born assassin who insisted he did
not know how he was driven to his deed, still is in prison. He was
convicted of first degree murder, but his death sentence was lifted
when California abolished the death penalty.
   Kennedy's grave site is marked with a simple cross and a small
pool, a stark contrast to the more ornate grave of his brother.
There, an eternal flame burns that can be seen from Washington,
across the Potomac River, and the area is bordered by a wall
inscribed with quotations from John F. Kennedy's speeches.
   The fourth of the 11 Kennedy children, David Anthony Kennedy, was
found dead of a drug overdose in West Palm Beach, Fla., in April
1984.
   The others are Kathleen Townsend, 36, who heads a Maryland youth
corps program and was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress; Joe,
35; Robert Jr., 34, who teaches environmental law at Pace
University; Courtney Ruhe, 31, a fund-raiser for the RFK Foundation;
   Michael, 30, who heads Citizens Energy Corp. in Boston; Mary, 28,
who runs RFK Center for Human Rights in Boston; Christopher, 24,
works for the family-owned Merchandise mart in Chicago; Matthew, 23,
a senior at Harvard; Douglas, 21, a sophomore at Boston College, and
Rory, 19, a freshman at Brown.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Monday
that the West should strengthen controls on its exports to the East
to keep its technological lead over the Soviet bloc.
   Carlucci said the West should not be lulled by last week's
superpower summit in Moscow.
   ``Until we see some tangible changes we should not change our
policies,'' he told the Japan National Press Club. ``We are still
facing a serious military threat.''
   He said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
perestroika _ restructuring Soviet society and the economy _
emphasizes improving technology. Carlucci said the Soviet Union
traditionally has obtained technology through sources other than its
own research, including stealing it.
   Carlucci said that the United States has at least a 10-year edge
over the Soviet Union in computer technology.
   The defense secretary said the way to maintain that lead is
through the Coordinating Committee for Export Control, which
regulates technology transfer to communist countries. He said
modifications should be made to tighten restrictions on sensitive
technology and loosen controls on lower-tier technology.
   ``It is vital for our collective security that we seek to
strengthen COCOM,'' Carlucci said.
   Last year, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. was accused of exporting
sophisticated technology to the Soviet Union.
   Carlucci warned that perestroika could lead to further Soviet
militarization.
   ``If the end result is the West relaxes its defense effort and
the Soviet Union modernizes its military and industrial base, and
the Soviet Union can manufacture enormously more weapons than today,
then we will have made a grave mistake,'' he said.
   Carlucci arrived in Japan last week from Moscow to brief leaders
here on the meeting between President Reagan and Gorbachev and to
discuss U.S.-Japanese security issues with Japan's defense and
governing party officials.
   The defense secretary lauded the dialogue between Moscow and
Washington that is made easier by the summits.
   ``Summits like the one just concluded make good sense,'' he said.
``But as we focus on the summit process, we must not lose sight of
this central fact: better relations must be built on a strong
foundation _ our ability to defend ourselves and our interests.
Summitry is no substitute for security.''
   He noted that ``we as yet see no change in the Soviet offensive
military structure.''

of ``sheer terror'' after being forced into a swimming pool had been
found psychologically unfit for rescue swimmer training, it was
revealed Monday.
   But a psychiatrist at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute later
reversed the finding, giving qualified permission for Airman Recruit
Lee Mirecki to resume training, said Chief Petty Officer Kevin
Brannigan, a hospital corpsman.
   Brannigan testified at a hearing to determine whether five
instructors and their commanding officer at the Rescue Swimmer
School should be court-martialed in the death of Mirecki on March 2.
   Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died after instructors allegedly
forced him back into the pool when he tried to quit the course
during a drill.
   Lt. Cmdr. Dave Shivley, a Navy flight surgeon, originally found
Mirecki unqualified saying in a report introduced as evidence that
the recruit had a phobia about being dragged under water.
   In a follow-up psychiatric examination, Lt. Cmdr. Laszlo I.
Navradszky reversed Shivley and wrote on medical records that
Mirecki's problem was occupational rather than a mental illness,
Brannigan said.
   But Navradszky also wrote that if Mirecki had further
difficulties, he would be disqualified from further rescue training,
Brannigan said.
   ``I didn't realize, just like the doctor didn't realize, that a
student would be made to continue training after he asked to quit,''
Brannigan testified.
   If they had, Brannigan said he was sure Navradszky would not have
allowed Mirecki to resume training. Earlier testimony indicated it
was the school's policy to require a student to complete a drill if
he tried to drop out during the exercise.
   Earlier, Capt. Delroy Hire, who performed the autopsy on Mirecki
and declared the death to be a homicide, testified it was a major
breach of procedure to send the sailor back to training. Instructors
at the school were not told of the report about Mirecki's phobia,
records showed.
   ``I do not believe, under the circumstances, he should have been
put back in the water,'' Hire said.
   Also Monday, a Navy spokesman denied an NBC News report, citing
Pentagon records, that one of the accused, Petty Officer 2nd Class
John W. Zelenock, had failed to meet instructor qualifications
because of a below-minimum evaluation and a disciplinary problem.
   ``All of the accused were qualified to teach the class,'' said
Lt. Lee Saunders, public affairs officer for the Naval Air Training
Command.
   In his testimony, Hire said Mirecki ``within reasonable medical
certainty'' would not have died if he had re-entered the water
voluntarily or had been allowed to stay out of the pool at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   ``We are talking about sheer terror,'' Hire said of Mirecki's
phobia of being pulled under water.
   Asked by the prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. Larry D. Wynne, whether it
would be accurate to say Mirecki was scared to death, Hire replied,
``It wouldn't be inappropriate at all.''
   Hire testified that the phobia trigged a reflex spasm that closed
Mirecki's throat to shut out water after he was returned to the pool.
   The reflex, however, also kept air from getting to his lungs,
causing cardiac arrest and subsequent drowning, said Hire, head of
the laboratory at the Pensacola Naval Laboratory.
   The instructors each have been charged with involuntary
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery, while Lt. Thomas A.
Torchia, commanding officer of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School, is
charged with dereliction of duty.
   Earlier testimony indicated Mirecki had left the pool during an
exercise called ``sharks and daisies,'' in which an instructor
randomly grabs a student in a head hold to simulate what a panicky
drowning victim might do.
   Mirecki held on to an equipment rack, shouting that he wanted to
quit the course, but instructors converged on him, one of them
saying ``Get him!'' or ``Get Mirecki,'' fellow students testified.
   Two instructors who were not charged testified Sunday they saw
other instructors throw or slide Mirecki back into the pool. Acting
head instructor Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael W. Combe took him to
the deep end and put another head hold on him, witnesses said.
   Mirecki escaped the hold and was towing Combe when he collapsed
and Combe pulled him to the edge of the pool, witnesses said.
   Hire, who based his findings on medical records, criminal
investigative reports and discussions with physicians who tried to
revive Mirecki, as well as the autopsy, said he was aware that a
psychologist who interviewed the recruit prior to his death had
concluded that he did not have a phobia of the water.
   ``Phobias are very specific; you don't have to have a fear of the
water,'' Hire said. ``You have fear of being grabbed and pulled
under the water.''
   Under cross-examination, defense lawyers questioned Hire's
qualifications to offer opinions about mental conditions.

<TEXT>
   The Senate passed a bill aimed at U.S.
military bases Monday that bans nuclear weapons and nuclear-armed
warships from the Philippines. Similar legislation is pending in the
House of Representatives.
   The vote was 19-3 with one abstention.
   Most senators favoring the bill spoke of the dangers nuclear
weapons pose. The three opposed said the law would cause problems
with the United States over the future of Clark Air Base, the Subic
Bay naval base and smaller U.S. installations in the country.
   Sen. Edgardo Angara abstained and said the Senate should consider
the position of President Corazon Aquino, who has pledged to respect
the bases agreement until it expires in 1991 and to keep options
open on an extension.
   In Washington, the State Department sharply criticized the bill.
   ``As drafted, the bill would permit no flexibility on nuclear
matters and would be incompatible with our policy of neither
confirming nor denying the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on
U.S. vessels, aircraft and facilities,'' said deputy spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley.
   There was no indication when the House would debate its version
of the bill. Mrs. Aquino can veto legislation, but Congress can
override the veto by two-thirds vote of each chamber.
   Opposition to nuclear weapons and to the American bases is
believed to be stronger in the Senate than in the 200-member House.
   The United States opposes any prohibitions that curtail the
ability of its ships and planes to carry nuclear weapons. It has
objected to similar measures in New Zealand and Denmark.
   Provisions of the Philippine bill set prison terms of up to 30
years for bringing nuclear weapons into the country, and up to 12
years for importing nuclear components.
   Supporters said the measure is directed at the six U.S.
installations where nuclear weapons are believed to be stored. The
United States will not confirm or deny whether it has nuclear
weapons in the Philippines, or whether a ship or aircraft carries
them.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, the chief sponsor, said the law would force
U.S. authorities to respect the Philippine constitution, which
prescribes a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons ``consistent
with the national interest.''
   He also said it would contribute ``to the ongoing process for
detente, denuclearization and disarmament in this part of the
world.''
   Jovito Salonga, the Senate president, said: ``The Philippines
should not be a promoter of the deadly arms race. We should never be
part of the problem. We should be part of the solution.''
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said he supported the bill to
protest the Aquino government's ``inaction'' on the constitutional
nuclear ban and because ``the presence of nuclear weapons in our
territory is inconsistent with the national interest.''
   The bill forbids storage or transit of nuclear weapons and the
entry of nuclear-armed ships or aircraft, but it allows port calls
by nuclear-powered commercial and research vessels after inspection
by Philippine authorities.
   U.S. officials have said such a law would severely limit American
military operations, particularly those of the Navy at the Subic Bay
base northwest of Manila.
   Under the new constitution, any extension of the bases agreement
must take the form of a treaty approved by a two-thirds vote of the
Senate. The Philippine Congress also can require a referendum.
   Philippine and U.S. officials began a review of the agreement in
April.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told a House committee Monday the
anti-nuclear bill was ``not completely satisfactory'' and requested
amendments that would give Mrs. Aquino greater flexibility in the
matter and in her dealings with the United States.
   Most of the weapons and equipment with which the Philippine
military fights a 19-year-old Communist insurgency come from the
United States, the main ally of this Pacific archipelago of 7,100
islands.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Rebels Are Coming to Canada on False Passports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels from Nicaragua are coming to Canada on false
passports, opposition members of Parliament complained Monday,
citing reports from Costa Rica.
   Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall told Parliament ``there is
a very large international problem of false documentation'' and said
the government was taking serious action to combat it.
   She noted that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested two Sri
Lankan men in Montreal last weekend and seized material used to make
200 forged Canadian travel permits allowing foreigners lacking
genuine passports to enter Canada.
   The Toronto Globe and Mail said Monday that 300 to 600 Nicarguans
living in Costa Rica have used forged documents to enter Canada in
the past eight months.
   It said the operation was run by the U.S.-backed guerrillas,
known as Contras, who are fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government.
   The report said Canadian officials in Costa Rica learned of the
forgeries in April but the racket continues.
   Since the beginning of last year, 1,335 Nicaraguans have claimed
refugee status at Canadian airports _ some of them holding genuine
passports.
   Sergio Marchi, immigration spokesman for the opposition Liberal
Party, said many Contras have ``horrible human rights violation
records'' and should be barred from Canada.
   Dan Heap, a member of Parliament from the opposition New
Democratic Party, complained that in Canada's official refugee
program, the government welcomed 1,177 Nicaraguans between January
1987 and March 1988, while taking only 568 Guatemalans where the
danger is far greater at the moment.
   Ms. McDougall responded that applicants are considered on a
case-by-case basis. She said that however an immigrant or refugee
enters Canada, war criminals and terrorists are unacceptable and the
system will eventually reject them.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government has
proposed legislation to toughen immigration and refugee laws, but
the opposition parties have delayed passage, contending that the
bills would penalize the genuinely needy as well as illegal aliens.

   Police arrested 19 people Monday to end an
occupation of a law firm's office by a group of Harvard University
students and alumni protesting the firm's work for a company that
has a subsidiary in South Africa.
   A group of about 35 demonstrators walked into the office of Ropes
& Gray at 10 a.m. They chanted and sang songs while a group of
supporters marched outside the building chanting ``Hey, hey Ropes
and Gray, how much does apartheid pay?''
   Boston police entered the building around 7:45 p.m. and arrested
the 19 people remaining. They were charged with trespassing and
released on bail pending arraignment Tuesday in Boston Municipal
Court, said police Lt. John Boyle.
   ``We didn't feel we had any other choice than have them
removed,'' said Thomas O'Donnell, a managing partner at the firm and
a principal target of the protest. He said protesters had earlier
refused his request for a meeting with just a few of their
representatives.
   The protesters said they were concerned that the firm represents
at least one company doing business in South Africa, while O'Donnell
co-chairs a committee of Harvard's board of overseers that is
reviewing the university's investment in companies with operations
in South Africa.
   ``It's a clear conflict of interest,'' said Betsy Fishman, a
Harvard senior who was among about 40 people outside the building
housing the firm's office.
   Ropes & Gray represents the Gillette Corp., said Truman Casner, a
senior partner and member of the law firm's management board. A
Gillette spokeswoman confirmed that the company has a subsidiary in
South Africa.
   Officials at the firm were attempting to arrange a meeting
between a representative for the protesters and O'Donnell, said
Casner, who added that the firm conducted business as usual Monday.
   Bruce Marks, who identified himself as a member of the Harvard
Divestment Coalition, said one demonstrator, Eric Chester, planned
to press assault charges against Ropes & Gray lawyers for what Marks
described as a scuffle.
   Another demonstrator, Michael Wolf, was being examined by a
doctor for a possible broken collarbone sustained in an altercation
with lawyers and security guards, Marks said.
   O'Donnell said Ropes & Gray officials could not confirm whether
any protesters were injured.

<HEAD>100 Soviets Reported Killed In Fighting with Afghan Guerrillas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heavy fighting raged in Afghanistan's
northeastern Baghland province and one report Monday said more than
100 Soviet soldiers were killed battling guerrillas.
   There was no independent confirmation.
   Baghland City, the provincial capital, has been under siege for
weeks. Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, chairman of the seven-party Moslem
guerrilla alliance, saids the city's collapse would be a coup for
his fighters.
   Agency Afghan Press, a private-run Pakistani news service,
claimed more than 100 Soviets and 15 guerrillas were killed on the
Salang Highway when the anti-Marxist guerrillas repulsed an attack
on their headquarters near the city on May 27.
   Departing Soviet troops travel the Salang Highway, the only road
out of Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul north to the Soviet Union.
   A strategic northern city would also give the U.S.-backed
guerrillas a stronghold should speculation prove true that Afghan
President Najib is eyeing the north as a possible refuge if Kabul is
overrun.
   Meanwhile, official Radio Kabul broadcasts have been playing up
guerrilla activities since May 15, the official start of the Soviet
withdrawal under a United Nations-sponsored peace accord. Prior
broadcasts virtually ignored guerrilla exploits.
   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, claimed late Sunday that
troops overran three guerrilla groups in southeastern Zabul and
Kandahar provinces and in northwestern Faryab province.
   Guerrilla commanders have been preparing for a major offensive on
the major city of Kandahar. According to Agency Afghan Press,
villages to the southwest of Kandahar City have been heavily bombed.
   Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and replaced one
Marxist government with another. It began withdrawing its more than
100,000 troops on May 15 after signing the April peace accord in
Geneva.

<TEXT>
   Investigators examined the charred remains
of two egg farms Monday to try to determine what set off blazes that
killed 240,000 hens, destroyed thousands of eggs and caused $7.5
million in damage.
   The hens were killed at Co-Hen Egg Farms in this tiny southern
Maine town late Saturday in a fire that engulfed three barns before
firefighters arrived. Debris from the 480-foot-long buildings was
still smoldering two days later, and that and the stench of charred
birds hampered investigators.
   About 60 trailer loads of eggs were destroyed Sunday in a fire
that swept through the storage and packing facilities at DeCoster
Egg Farms, the nation's largest brown egg producer, in Turner, Fire
Chief Laurence Gagne said. No livestock died.
   Bruce E. Mullen, fire chief of Goodwins Mills, near Dayton,
estimated the loss at Co-Hen Farms at $2.5 million. Gagne said the
damage at DeCoster Farms, located 12 miles north of Auburn, was
about $5 million.
   Investigators from the state Fire Marshal's office said
determining the cause of both fires could take up to a week.
   ``We've got no idea,'' investigator Joseph A. Levasseur said,
surveying the smoldering ruins at Co-Hen Farms. ``We'll start at one
end and work our way to the other. I haven't ruled out anything at
this point.''
   State Department of Environmental Protection officials urged
Dayton town officials to quickly dispose of the charred chickens.
   But officials said neither the birds nor debris from the
buildings could be buried at the fire site because the ground is
sandy, gravely and susceptible to seepage, and a suitable burial
site had not yet been found, said Peter N. Mosher of the state
Department of Agriculture.
   The board discussed the disposal question at a Monday night
meeting but deferred a decision until Tuesday, Selectman Clement
Meserve Jr. said.
   Despite the loss of the hens, which produced nearly 200,000 eggs
per day, Co-Hen Farms remained in operation Monday with eight
surviving hen houses on that farm, said Dennis Babb, a supervisor at
Co-Hen.
   Co-Hen, which also owns other egg farms in Maine, has about
600,000 hens, making it one of Northern New England's largest egg
producers.
   Lost egg production will be made up through contracts with
smaller egg producers in the area, said Lois L. Hall, a secretary to
Co-Hen owner Maurice Cohen.
   This is not the first time fire has swept through the DeCoster
farm. On March 7, 1987, fire destroyed 25,000 hens.

   The navy exploded a mine and depth
charges Monday night southeast of Stockholm as part of an
intensified effort to stop underwater intrusions by suspected
mini-submarines, officials said.
   The use of the weapons came after indications that a foreign
submarine operated between Orno and Uto islands. That is in the
vicinity of Sweden's main east coast naval base at Musko, 18{ miles
southeast of Stockholm.
   A mine was exploded in the same area a week ago and military
preparedness has been high since then. The navy would say only that
the search continued.
   The navy has exploded mines, depth charges and anti-sub grenades
on a half-dozen occasions during the past week, both on the east
coast and in the archipelago off Goteborg on the west coast.
   Numerous dead fish were the only tangible effects reported.
   Navy spokesmen on Monday denied news reports that a damaged
minisub was suspected to be hiding near Donso island off Goteborg.
   A military staff spokesman, Thomas Guer, said naval subhunters
are acting under new government directives which permit firing at
intruders without warning in the inner archipelago and sometimes in
waters farther out.

<HEAD>Morton Thiokol Declines to Bid on Advanced Solid Rocket Motor</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new information; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morton Thiokol Inc., which produced the rocket
booster blamed for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger, announced Monday it will stay out of competition to
build an advanced version of the rocket.
   The Chicago-based company said in a statement it wants to
concentrate its resources on its immediate task of redesigning the
booster blamed for the 1986 deaths of seven astronauts shortly after
takeoff from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to use
Thiokol's redesigned motor when it resumes shuttle flights, NASA
spokeswoman Sarah Keegan said Monday night from her home in
Washington D.C. The advanced motor will be used in the mid-1990s,
she said.
   The company's Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor program is almost
complete, with a test firing set for July at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
said Rocky Raab, a Morton Thiokol spokesman in Salt Lake City, Utah.
   Thiokol was the lone manufacturer of shuttle motors and NASA must
look elsewhere for producers of the new version, the Advanced Solid
Rocket Motor.
   Although bidding has not opened for the advanced motor, three
other parties have expressed an interest in the contract, Raab said.
   He identified them as United Technologies, the bidding team of
Lockheed and Aerojet, and another team consisting of Hercules,
Atlantic Research Corp. and Martin Marietta.
   A presidential commission blamed the deaths of seven astronauts,
including teacher Christa McAuliffe, seconds after launch on Jan.
28, 1986, on a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a
solid-fuel booster rocket built by Thiokol and ignited the main fuel
tank. Thiokol immediately undertook the task of redesigning the
motor.
   Reading from a statement, Keegan said NASA anticipates ``a
healthy degree of competition for the ASRM (advanced motor) contract
when the request for proposals is released, and we look forward to
our continued association with Morton Thiokol in the curent solid
rocket motor program.''
   Thiokol's decision not to seek the ASRM contract follows an
earlier NASA announcement that the space agency wants to build a
government-owned facility to produce the larger rocket motors and
subcontract with a private manufacturer to operate the plant.
   NASA has earmarked $27 million of its current budget for design
and initial construction of a new booster plant somewhere on the
Gulf Coast. Officials have said they plan to add $65 million from
next year's budget to fund the project, and estimate it will take at
least 10 years to get such a plant funded and operational.
   Thiokol, a manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals, high
technology propulsion systems and salt, plans to invest $200 million
in the next several years to modernize its plant in northern Utah in
order to seek other space and defense business, Raab said.
   The plant, located 90 miles north of Salt Lake City, is one of
Utah's largest private employers, with 2,500 workers.
   Thiokol continues to supply shuttle booster hardware under a
contract with NASA. The company also will build a new,
environmentally controlled building for the redesigned version of
the old solid rocket booster.
   The new facility the company is planning will involve case
refurbishment, nozzle manufacture and propellant casting, he said,
adding that Morton Thiokol intends to go after the Air Force
Advanced Launch System, a strap-on booster and other contracts.

   They judge it so not because of any great strides in human rights

change is possible.
   Inside Brighton Beach's White Acia delicatessen, where American
cookies are sold alongside hot ponchicks and kbac _ Russian versions

   ``You cannot be very optimistic because of the communist

   The first visit to Moscow by a U.S. president in 14
years was overshadowed in the state-run media by a spirited
discussion of domestic politics, a debate that brought unprecedented
developments and raised issues not heard since the 1920s.
   The argument is over a nationwide Communist Party conference
starting June 28 that is shaping up as a battleground for supporters
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and the mid-level managers who
oppose them.
   Entrenched bureaucrats fear the Soviet leader's campaign to end
party oversight of the day-to-day details of governing and economic
planning and give the people a greater role, sociologist Tatyana
Zaslavskaya said in an interview printed Saturday by the newspaper
Izvestia.
   A senior Western diplomat said ``they have not debated issues as
basic as this since the 1920s,'' when the tyranny of Josef Stalin
began.

   As Soviet troops proceed with their
withdrawal from Afghanistan, the war between government forces and
anti-communist guerrillas is entering a new stage.
   The ultimate test will be whether either side can muster enough
cohesion, military might and popular acceptance to impose its will
on a nation that throughout history has resisted control by any
central authority.
   The U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas have proved themselves adept
at defending their home turf in the countryside, but in a decade of
fighting they have yet to capture a major city.
   Almost every night, one or more guerrilla rockets land in or near
Kabul, but these attacks seem to constitute little more than
harassment _ not a battle for the capital, which is still defended
by Soviet soldiers.
   A Western diplomat said last week that he believes the guerrillas
could eventually triumph over the Soviet-style government, but only
if they change their methods.

   A huge blimp-like balloon floating
serenely in the southern Arizona sky is a new weapon in a widening
war, a radar-packed eye-in-the-sky searching for airborne drug
smugglers.
   When it becomes fully operational this month, the nearly $18
million balloon will scan the sky to the south, tracking low-flying

   Federal regulators on Monday ordered payment of
a record $1.35 billion to depositors in two insolvent savings
institutions in California.
   In rare move, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed American
Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan
Association, both of Costa Mesa, without arranging for a takeover by
another institution.
   Only 10 of 235 failed S&Ls handled since 1981 have been resolved
with a straight payoff of depositors. Usually, the bank board pays a
bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick S&L because it is cheaper.
At the very least, the board arranges to transfer deposits to
another institution.

   President Reagan said Monday that while the
Moscow summit produced ``important additional strides'' toward a
strategic arms treaty, ``we still don't know'' when it can be
achieved.
   In a post-summit assessment of his talks with Soviet General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Reagan acknowledged that completion
of the less-ambitious Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF,
treaty was ``the event that held perhaps the most immediate historic
importance.''
   Reagan looked rested and refreshed after a quiet weekend at the
White House, and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president
``feels very good, in fact, frisky.''

<HEAD>Taiwan's Newspapers Become Livelier in Liberalization Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lively and sometimes critical political
reporting is showing up on the pages of Taiwan's newspapers as a
liberalization trend sweeps the island nation.
   The zestier coverage began in January, when the government lifted
a 37-year-old ban on the establishment of new newspapers and the era
of rule by Chiang Kai-shek and his family came to an end.
   With the market suddenly open to new competition, newspapers
attracted new readers among Taiwan's 19.6 million people by breaking
taboos on stories about the Chiang family, allegations of
malfeasance by top officials and high-level power struggles.
   ``The changes have been substantial ... although it may take some
time before we can have the full-fledged freedom the Western press
enjoys,'' said Fu Cheng, a political science professor who was
jailed for six years after his magazine was banned in 1960 for
criticizing the Chiangs' long-governing Nationalist Party.
   It became clear the old rules no longer applied when newspapers
exposed a power struggle among Nationalist leaders after the death
of President Chiang Ching-kuo on Jan. 13, ending a family dynasty
begun by his father, Chiang Kai-shek, six decades earlier.
   Readers were startled by newspaper reports indicating, but never
confirmed, that Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the father's widow who is in
her early 90s and now lives in seclusion in suburban Taipei, was
behind a last-ditch effort to delay the naming of the new president,
Lee Teng-hui, as acting party chairman.
   ``This would have been unthinkable just two years ago,'' said Hu
Yuan-hui, a reporter of the liberal Independence Evening Post.
``There would have been an order for the shutdown of the
newspapers.''
   Alice Kao, deputy editor in chief of the mass-circulation United
Daily News, said that ``almost all political taboos were lifted
overnight'' and that authorities stopped interfering with news
coverage so long as newspapers did not espouse communism or question
the Nationalists' claim that they should govern mainland China too.
   The Nationalist government came to power on the mainland early in
the century but fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to
Mao Tse-tung's communists.
   The Nationalists since have exercised one-party rule over Taiwan,
with the newspaper restrictions a method to allow close government
control of the media. Editors frequently received late night
telephone calls from Nationalist officials demanding that
unfavorable stories be dropped or played down.
   Ending restrictions on the number of newspapers that could
publish is part of a recent liberalization program initiated by
Chiang Ching-kuo before his death. The program included the
scrapping of martial law, the formation of opposition parties and
the release of political prisoners.
   Among the articles published in Taiwan newspapers this year:
   _Reports identifying Chiang Ching-kuo's illegitimate twin sons,
one a vice foreign minister and the other the dean of a prominent
law school.
   _Critical reporting about the military, including articles
suggesting the armed forces may wield too much power.
   _Sensationalized stories that a top Taiwanese nuclear scientist
allegedly worked for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and fled
to the United States with secrets about a nuclear development
program. The Nationalist government denies it builds atomic bombs.
   _Expanded coverage of mainland China, in part because the
newspapers have increased in size from the usual 12 pages to 24, a
maximum they themselves established.
   Since the media ban was lifted, the government has issued
licenses for about 50 new newspapers. Meanwhile, the existing 30
newspapers, including seven owned by the government and two by the
Nationalist Party, have upgraded their printing equipment and
recruited new reporters.
   ``Market force dominates now,'' Professor Fu said. ``The days are
gone when newspaper reports were twisted under political forces.''
   Opposition politicians, however, claim that most newspapers still
do not give prominence to opposition views and activities, while
President Lee receives a generally favorable press.
   The opposition also notes that Taiwan's 33 radio stations and
three television networks remain under government control.
   But Chang Chun-hong, who heads a research center affiliated with
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said that while many
newspapers remain conservative, ``The important thing is we now have
a society of many voices.''
   Another sign of the times is that owners of the two largest
newspaper chains recently submitted their resignations from the
Nationalist Party's policy-making Central Standing Committee. The
move is viewed as an effort to improve the newspapers' credibility.

<HEAD>Teacher Abuse of Students Charged in Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deaths of five students after excessive
disciplining by teachers over the past three years has raised
concern about corporal punishment and rigid rules in Japanese
schools.
   ``The death toll is unprecedented,'' said Morikatsu Imahashi, an
Ibaraki University professor specializing on such issues. ``In the
postwar period up to 1985, there was only one known case where a
student died of injuries inflicted by a teacher, and that was in
1957.''
   Corporal punishment was banned under Japanese law after World War
II. But following a wave of student violence in the late 1970s,
education officials resurrected rigid rules of prewar times and
approved physical force in the classroom.
   The result, Imahashi and other critics say, is a controlled
education system but an alarming rise in physical abuse of students
by teachers.
   ``A growing number of children and adults are starting to
question the validity of corporal punishment and all those strange
rules, but ... not enough has been done,'' said Yasuhiro Yoshimine,
a lawyer and leading member of a juvenile rights committee in the
Japan Federation of Bar Associations.
   The first of the five students to die after being punished was
16-year-old Toshinau Takahashi, who in 1985 used a hair dryer in
violation of school rules. His teacher ordered him down on his knees
and repeatedly hit and kicked him until he fell unconscious with
mortal head injuries.
   A court sentenced the teacher to three years in prison for
``inflicting bodily injury resulting in death.'' In 1987 another
instructor received the same three-year sentence for causing the
classroom death of an 8-year-old. The other three cases are still
pending in the courts.
   The Education Ministry said last fall that the number of public
school teachers fired or suspended for corporal punishment reached a
record high of 189 in 1986. Additionally, almost 900 teachers were
reprimanded or warned for going too far in disciplining their
students.
   With compulsory education to age 15, Japan has 21.7 million
students in public and private schools from elementary to high
school.
   In a well-publicized incident in May, a teacher in charge of a
four-day school outing near Tokyo beat a student for having a poor
attitude and then went on to similarly punish 30 others, who had
been ordered to line up in the hallway, one by one.
   Other teachers have attacked students with metal bats, or joined
in groups to punch offending students.
   Takeshi Hayashi, 20-year-old author of two popular books
condemning school rules and violent teachers, claims schools are
retreating to the authoritarian pattern of prewar Japan by insisting
that students follow strict dress and behavior codes.
   Some 90 percent of students in public junior high schools are
required to wear dark, military-style suits for boys and sailor
outfits for girls. In the the 1960s only about 10 percent of the
schools in Tokyo had dress codes.
   Most students today are also expected to cut their hair precisely
to school specifications, wear standard white underwear and adhere
to an endless list of rules that apply both on and off school
grounds.
   ``But what's worse is corporal punishment,'' said Hayashi, who
has become a teen-age hero for writing his books.
   Physical punishment was an ``everyday happening'' in the
Tokyo-area schools he attended, he said in an interview.
   But he added that his experience paled in comparison to the
stories recounted in about 3,000 letters he received from youths
around the country.
   ``In my schools, teachers never touched the girls. Then I got
letters from way-off places where it seems really wild, like
teachers grabbing girls by the head and chopping off their hair in
front of the other students just for disobeying hairstyle rules.''
   Following public outcry over recent incidents of alleged teacher
brutality, the Education Ministry has urged school officials to
practice moderation in drawing up rules and dealing out punishment.
   But Sadanobu Miwa, education professor at Chiba University, says
the government should be tackling the education system as a whole,
not just branding teachers as culprits.
   Japanese schools are pressure-cookers where students prepare at
an early age for difficult extrance examinations for prestigious
universities.
   Miwa said those who make it into the teaching profession have
excelled in the education system, but they tend to be underdeveloped
as human beings.
   ``And it is these people, put in front of 40 pupils, who turn to
corporal punishment to control the classroom,'' Miwa said.

<HEAD>Latin America Sees Little Headway in Environmental Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 15 years of breakneck population
and industrial growth, Latin America is taking stock of its progress
in environmental protection _ and it is not happy with what it sees.
   Following a landmark international conference in Stockholm,
Sweden, in 1972 on the environment, Latin Americans set out with
high hopes of promoting growth while protecting its largely
untouched resources.
   Throughout the area, special government ministries and
departments were created, pollution standards were approved, and
millions of dollars were spent on campaigns to protect the
environment.
   But the results ``have not been what we would have desired,''
conceded Jose Lizarraga, director of the United Nations
Environmental Program for Latin America and the Caribbean.
   ``In practice, environmental management lost the priority status
it had been given, and in some cases was simply forgotten,'' he said
in an interview. ``Even while there has been a big advance in terms
of consciousness-raising, there has not been such improvement in
actual management.''
   Lizarraga met with Latin American officials involved with
environmental issues for a conference here in April to assess the
region's progress in protecting its environment.
   The officials blamed the deterioration on burgeoning urban
populations and industrial growth, which Lizarraga called
``predatory and short-sighted.''
   In Mexico City, now one of the largest cities in the world, too
many vehicles using leaded gasoline have led to air pollution so bad
that people often can't wear contact lenses.
   In just two generations, Brazil's population has changed from 70
percent rural to 73 percent urban, with sewerless shantytowns
ringing major cities and an 8-million-unit housing deficit.
   Most large Latin American cities have seen immigrants swarm in
from the countryside to live in substandard housing without running
water, sewage facilities, garbage disposal or paved roads.
   But even widespread urban housing and health problems are
surpassed by industrial pollution in terms of long-range damage, the
environmental experts said.
   While pollution standards and procedures for dealing with wastes
are often on the books, enforcement is lax and penalties are often
painless.
   In Venezuela the worst penalty for violating an environmental law
is a 50,000-bolivar fine (about $3,400 at the official exchange
rate) and three days in jail, according to Environment Vice Minister
Carlos Barrios.
   Treatment of industrial effluents often is inadequate or
non-existant, and wastes are being dumped into rivers or lakes used
for recreation and drinking, in violation of laws on the books.
   Fertilizers, including some that are limited or banned in
industrialized countries, also are being used to gain more
production faster from poor land, the environmental experts said.
   In Venezuela, before a clean-up effort began in 1984, Lake
Maracaibo was nearly dead from the dumping of untreated waste from
industries on its shores and from Maracaibo, a city of 1 million,
which until recently had no sewage treatment plant.
   According to Lizarraga and others, Latin America's poor record in
environmental protection is mainly a political problem.
   ``Environmental repair is more costly than prevention, even
though prevention can cost more in the short-term. The problem is
that politicians have a short-term view,'' Lizarraga said.
   Officials also note that Latin America's debt crises have made
the situation worse.
   Government spending for environmental concerns has been cut to
pay huge foreign debts.
   At the same time, the need to produce and export more, so that
debts can be paid, has aggravated the region's tendency to exploit
its natural resources as intensively as possible.
   ``Sometimes you lose hope,'' Lizarrage said. ``But over the last
15 years there has been a process of maturity and
consciousness-raising. What we have to do now is transform this
consciousness into action.''

<HEAD>Composer Looks for Right Sounds for TV Shows</HEAD>

   Composer Craig Safan was looking for the right
sound to express the feeling of NBC's ``Cheers.''
   ``One of the most important things a film composer does is come
up with a sound for a project,'' he said. ``Every movie and
television show sounds different. After reading the first script of
`Cheers' the sound came to me.
   ``I said I wanted an instrument that sounds like a bar. Jimmy
Burrows, who's the director and one of the executive producers,
suggested a clarinet. Then it came to me: Woody Allen playing the
clarinet at 3 a.m. in a bad band. It's not slick. They're not trying
to impress anyone. It's just Woody Allen and a few guys playing
because they love to play.''
   Safan writes the background music for ``Cheers.'' He did not
write the theme song that opens the show.
   ``We do the music for `Cheers' at a studio,'' said Safan. ``I
play the piano.''
   Safan has composed the theme music for ABC's ``Supercarrier'' and
scores for ``The Twilight Zone,'' ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' and
``Amazing Stories.'' He wrote music for such TV movies as
``Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story,'' ``Timestalkers'' and
``Getting Married,'' and more recently the theatrical feature
``Stand and Deliver.''
   Ordinarily, Safan records most of his music in the little studio
in the converted garage behind his home. He works primarily with
electronics, but may find a tune in anything from a plastic water
bottle to his son's xylophone.
   He recorded the soundtrack for ``Stand and Deliver'' in the
studio. His primary instruments were a water bottle and a lag bolt.
   ``It has a feeling of traditional Latin music in the main
title,'' he said. ``But I tried to go into the subtext. What is this
really about? It's about a man yearning to do something specific for
people. It never matters that it's a Latin story. It's like saying
`Romeo and Juliet' is a story about two Italians.
   ``I listened to a lot of Latin music, but there are so many
different kinds. Then I began to mimic sounds. I used a water bottle
for a conga. I recorded it digitally and played it back through the
computer. The guiro is a gourd with little ridges you scrape with a
piece of wood. I took a lag bolt and scraped wood along the threads
and recorded it digitally in the Synclavier. You can record every
possible sound into the computer. That's how you turn a lag bolt
into a percussion instrument.''
   His studio is lighted by skylights. One side is all glass and
opens onto what will be a Japanese garden. A 400-year-old Buddha is
set up there, and the gate is a 100-year-old Japanese sliding door.
   ``Since I do most of my work at home I want to create my own
environment,'' he said.
   He composed a Japanese musical that was performed at the
Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., which is where
``Annie'' and ``Man of La Mancha'' began. The musical, ``Butterfly''
is an adaptation of ``Madam Butterfly'' and was done in
collaboration with Mark Mueller.
   For ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' he used his son's toys _
bells, a xylophone and a shake toy to make a sinister sound for the
show.
   Safan began writing music while a student at Brandeis University.
``I came back to Los Angeles and got into the record business,'' he
said. ``Then some friends of mine were doing a small film at the
American Film Institute. I did the music for them.
   ``Than another old friend, Walter Park, was working on a
documentary called `The California Reich,''' he said. ``I wrote a
piece for a string quartet and flute and used a mellatron, which was
an early electronic instrument.''
   Next he did a small horror film, and assignments began coming his
way steadily.
   ``It wasn't something I went after,'' he said. ``The jobs came to
me after I said this is what I want to do.''

   The ancestral home of millions of people on
Taiwan is here in Fujian province on the Chinese mainland, and local
officials are trying to lure Taiwanese businessmen back.
   They have even enlisted the aid of a Chinese sea goddess.
   Taiwan and Fujian are separated by 100 miles of water in the
Formosa Strait and 40 years of hostility between the Communist
mainland and Nationalist Taiwan.
   Some businessmen have come to Fujian, nevertheless, even at the
risk of prosecution at home.
   Deputy Gov. You Dexin told visiting foreign reporters that 50
Taiwan firms have defied their government's ban on trade contacts
with the mainland to invest about $50 million in the province.
   The actual number may be much higher. Most Taiwanese avoid
trouble at home by contracting under the names of Hong Kong agents
or relatives on the mainland.
   Taiwan-Fujian trade, which totalled $40 million last year,
reached $20 million in the first four months of 1988, You said. Most
goes through middlemen in Hong Kong, although more than 10 percent
is done out on the Taiwan Strait. Overall, indirect trade between
Taiwan and the entire Chinese mainland was an estimated $1.5 billion
last year.
   Fujian officials said among the ideas for bringing in more Taiwan
money are plans to turn three offshore islands into economic zones
for Taiwan investors.
   One is Meizhou, home of the 10th century legendary figure Mazu
who is worshipped on both sides of the strait as a protrectress for
seafarers. For businessmen braving the still stormy waters of the
strait, Mazu could provide welcome shelter.
   Taiwan has been estranged from the mainland since the
Nationalists lost a civil war to the Communists in 1949 and fled to
the island.
   China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, encourages
direct trade and communications links as a first step toward
reunification. In the past, Taiwan adamantly refused all contacts
with the mainland, but it began in October to allow people to visit
relatives in China.
   In the first six months after travel restrictions were lifted,
65,000 Taiwanese came to China, many to Fujian, where about 80
percent of Taiwan's 19.6 million people have their roots.
   Fujian officials say it is inevitable that Taiwan, with its
currency appreciating against the U.S. dollar and its wage costs
rising, will move factories to China, where labor is much cheaper
and where language and customs are the same .
   ``They can make money here,'' said Chen He, magistrate of a
township in the provincial capital of Fuzhou, which is building a
$2.4-million sports equipment factory with a Taiwanese businessman.
``This is their homeland and they love it.''
   During a recent press tour of the province, people frequently
talked of contacts with Taiwan enterprises.
   Hong Ziwei, a 29-year-old toy manufacturer in Shishi, said he
would meet a Taiwan businessman in August to discuss a joint venture
to export toys. The Taiwanese man, he said, had written a letter to
a local relative asking for help in finding a mainland partner.
   In Quanzhou, Mayor Chen Rongchun said sweet potatoes, a favorite
among millions of Taiwanese with roots in Fujian, could be a big
seller on Taiwan.
   ``Taiwan compatriots will cherish an intimate kind of emotion for
goods coming from this place,'' he said.
   Much of the Taiwanese investment goes to Xiamen, a southern
Fujian port that is one of the nation's four designated special
economic zones with greater authority to attract foreign investment.
   Xiamen's authorities said 39 projects with anticipated Taiwanese
investment worth $42 million have been approved in such fields as
jewelry, shoes, bicycle parts and aluminum window frames.
   While emphasizing that Taiwan is part of China, mainland
officials say Taiwanese are given the same preferential treatment as
foreign investors, or better. In Xiamen, for example,
Taiwanese-funded joint ventures receive a four-year tax holiday,
rather than the three years given foreign enterprises.
   Two Taiwanese business executives in May were given five-year
prison terms by a Taipei court for business dealings on the
mainland. Because of that Fujian officials promise to keep secret
the details of all Taiwanese transactions.
   ``The first question we take into consideration is their personal
security,'' Deputy Gov. You said. ``We take measures to keep their
names secret.''

   For 500 years, Brazil's northeast has
been potentially rich and chronically poor.
   Today, as Brazil struggles to become a modern developed nation,
the Northeast holds it back _ not wholly of its own accord.
   The nine northeastern states cover 1 million square miles of land
where Brazil bulges out into the Atlantic. In the area, 2{ times the
size of Texas, live 45 million of the nation's 143 million people.
   But while the prosperous South, with its airplane and computer
factories, has made Brazil the world's eighth-largest economy, the
northeast remains poor, neglected, diseased and assailed by
devastating cyclical droughts.
   Statistics paint a gloomy picture of the northeast:
   _Infant mortality is higher than in sub-Saharan Africa at 124
deaths per 1,000 births, compared to 67 per 1,000 in the South.
   _Life expectancy is 51 years, compared with 67 in the South.
   _A full 50 percent of northeasterners cannot write their own
names; 26 percent can't elsewhere in Brazil.
   _Diseases long-eradicated elsewhere _ leprosy, chagas disease,
polio, tuberculosis, even the plague _ still kill and deform in the
northeast.
   ``We're creating a race of undersized subhumans who think only of
survival,'' said Carlos Hollanda Labor, health secretary for the
northeast's Ceara state.
   In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy recognized the
parched region, considered one of the world's poorest, as a possible
source of social unrest. Shortly after Fidel Castro's revolution in
Cuba, Kennedy launched the U.S. Alliance for Progress, which
promised billions of dollars and poured millions into development of
Brazil's northeast _ until a 1964 Brazilian right-wing military coup
eased fears of a communist or left-wing uprising.
   Droughts were a tragic part of the northeastern landscape even
before Portuguese conquerers recorded the first one more than 400
years ago.
   A drought that lasted from 1979 to 1984 killed an estimated
250,000 peasant farmers and chased millions more to big city slums
in search of food, water and jobs.
   This year, an expected rainfall of 31 inches will provide a
respite for the characteristically small-statured northeasterners,
but it is not likely to alter their struggle to survive.
   ``The essential problem here is not whether it rains or not,''
said Ari Guimaraes, head of the political science department of the
University of Bahia, another northeastern state. ``The problem is
that the government hasn't built reservoirs, explored underground
water supplies, irrigated peasant properties or distributed land
among those who have no means to survive.''
   From the 1500s well into the 19th century, the northeast was a
productive area, but the wealth stayed with a few.
   Agriculture led the economic activity, and the vast open spaces
lent themselves to production of Brazil's most precious commodities
at the time: cattle, cotton, sugar, tobacco and much later, coffee.
   The Portuguese crown handed out large stretches of land to nobles
and deserving soldiers. But far from central government control in
the South, northeast landowners set ``wild-west'' laws for peasant
``subjects'' and used private armies to chase individual farmers
from modest-sized lands.
   Such scenes have been pointedly described by Brazil's leading
novelist, Jorge Amado, in ``Gabriela Clove and Cinnamon,'' ``Bahia''
and most recently ``Showdown.''
   Successive governments have made promises to wrench the inland
population from medieval-like poverty, but gun battles over land and
vast misuse of government funds in the region are still common.
   The military government that governed from 1964 through 1985
built dams for hydroelectric power, roads, soccer stadiums and
stretched electricty lines across the dry, cracked land. One tough
military president, the late Gen. Emilio Medici, who is said to have
condoned the torture of political opponents, was on the verge of
tears when he saw the northeast's poverty first hand.
   But the grandiose projects of the military government did little
to ease the average northeasterner's lack of food, jobs, water and
land.
   A common belief among Northesterns is that the few direct
investments in their social concerns, such as food and water
distributions during droughts and emergency work-relief jobs, were
turned to political advantage by local land-owning politicians who
pass along favors to those who vote for them.
   ``It is in the interests of the landowners to maintain the region
in utter poverty,'' claimed Maria Luiza Fontenelle, mayor of
Fortaleza, capital of Ceara and the northeast's largest city, with a
population of 1.6 million.
   ``When people are poor they depend upon favors to survive.''
   According to Bishop Jose Rodrigues of the Roman Catholic Church
in the hinterlands of Bahia, mayors control local unions and decide
who gets access to government health care, jobs and other benefits.
   When the military stepped down and civilian government returned
to Brazil in 1985, hopes for widespread social reforms ran high. But
many northeasterners say civilian rule for them has been a hollow
triumph.
   Last year, the region sold $4.4 billion worth of fruit, nuts,
cocoa, sugar, tobacco and petroleum to southern Brazil and foreign
countries but received only $1 billion in government investments.
   Promises of a land reform, irrigation of 2.5 million acres of
land and 2 million jobs were slashed as the government of President
Jose Sarney sought to to cut a massive budget deficit, control
runaway inflation projected at 600 percent annually and meet
payments on a $121 billion foreign debt.
   Most significantly, Brazil's proposed new constitution makes
virtually impossible a long-promised land reform to distribute the
46 percent of rural properties owned by just 1.2 percent of the
population. The Catholic church has accused the government of bowing
to powerful landowners on the issue.
   But political scientists say the northeast's problems are fast
becoming problems for the rest of the country, most particularly the
more affluent South.
   northeasterners, for example, now occupied whole shanty towns in
the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, pressing already
precarious social and health services and pushing up crime rates.
   ``Brazil will never be a stable democracy ... nor a developed
country without resolving its vast inequalities,'' said one
political scientist, Helio Jaguaribe.
   But the political balance also may be shifting.
   In the 1986 gubernatorial elections, northeasterners chose four
governors who are considered politically progressive and more likely
to contest landowner power.
   Mayor Fontenelle of Fortaleza, for example, is a member of the
Radical Worker's Party.
   At the same time, the Roman Catholic Church presses on its own
for change.
   Bishop Rodrigues has helped rural workers in seven of his 11
doceses take control of local labor unions, often resulting in gun
and stick battles between private armies of conservative mayors and
local farmers.
   In Jucas, a town of 8,000 people 300 miles west of Fortaleza, the
Rev. Hans Stecker, a German priest who arrived 28 years ago, wages a
relentless battle with Mayor Jose Fagundes, also the town's largest
landowner.
   The priest has built a hospital, 39 schools and pre-schools and
started health and education programs. Stecker said that in response
to his projects the three-term mayor cut church's telephone lines
and prohibited the teaching of religion in town schools.
   ``In some towns,'' said political scientist Guimaraes, ``the
local priest can't leave home without a gun.''

<TEXT>
   The government says its campaign to reduce
atmospheric pollution is working, but some among Athen's 3.5 million
people are not so sure.
   For years, the capital has been plagued by a brown layer of
noxious smoke, exhaust fumes and factory emissions that Athenians
call the ``nefos,'' Greek for cloud.
   On a warm windless day, the ``nefos'' sends an average of 300
Athenians to hospitals complaining of headaches, chest pains, nausea
and stinging eyes.
   ``I drive around Athens all day and when I get home my nose is
clogged and my hair is oily from the fumes,'' said Michalis
Leontsakos, one of the city's 15,000 taxi drivers. ``And when summer
hits, it's much worse.''
   Last July a 10-day heatwave compounded the smog problem and more
than 1,200 mostly poor and elderly Athenians died of heatstroke or
breathing problems.
   Officials in Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's Socialist
government maintain, however, that a new package of anti-smog
measures is producing results and that last summer's high
temperatures are unlikely to recur.
   ``The recent package has been particularly productive,''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It flies to more than 17 miles high, out of
harm's way, at three times the speed of sound, faster than a bullet.
The SR-71, the original stealth jet called the ``Blackbird,'' is 25
years old now but it still holds world records for speed and
altitude. As one Air Force pilot says, ``The SR-71 excites the boy
in all of us who love to fly.''

   The SR-71 suddenly flashes into view
out of nowhere, like a star ship in the movies. Shaped like a
dagger, black and sinister, it slices cloud puffs in an otherwise
blue sky as it climbs slowly to mate with a refueling air tanker.
   This is the ``Blackbird,'' the original stealth jet that rockets
at 2,100 mph to the edge of space as it spies on global hot spots
out of reach of attack.
   The spacesuit-clad pilot and navigator _ members of an elite Air
Force team _ peer out toward the refueling tanker, where a news crew
is observing a training exercise that wandered 1,200 miles over five
Western states.
   The ``Blackbird,'' the photo reconnaissance jet U.S. Air Force
officials call part engineering miracle, part ghost, is the one that
first employed stealth or radar-evading technology, the one that
still packs top-secret gear and was once so secret that TV news film
of it was confiscated by the military.
   Its crew members, who themselves were the target of an espionage
attempt at their home base in California, say they have been
attacked numerous times by missiles fired from ground forces or jet
fighters futilely trying to cut short the Blackbird's missions,
which involve photographing foreign nations. SR-71s don't return
fire. They're unarmed.
   The twin-engine Blackbird is able to evade the attacks because it
still holds world records for speed and altitude, even though it is
25 years old.
   Its top capabilities remain secret, but the Air Force says it
flies to more than 85,000 feet at over three times the speed of
sound. That's roughly 33 miles a minute _ faster than a bullet, fast
enough to streak from San Francisco to New York in 1 hour, 45
minutes.
   A former SR-71 pilot, Col. Richard Graham, says the aging plane,
which was designed by Lockheed, can still out-perform most, if not
all, of the other operational aircraft in the world.
   ``For the 1960s, it was way ahead of its time. It was at the
leading edge of stealth technology,'' says Graham, who commands the
wing that includes the sole SR-71 squadron, stationed at Beale Air
Force Base, 110 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   Adds current Blackbird pilot, Lt. Col. Bill Orcutt: ``I think the
aircraft still carries quite a bit of mystique ... It looks like
something from outer space. The SR-71 excites the boy in all of us
who love to fly.''
   The pilots say it flies like no other: ``You're so far up you
don't have a sensation of speed and you start to see the curvature
of the earth,'' says Graham. ``It's smooth, serene, peaceful, quiet
_ you hear your own breathing. There's no weather at that altitude
... If you look straight up (into space), it's black.''
   But cutbacks are planned in the Blackbird program because of
budget restraints and the aircraft may soon be replaced by a
super-advanced stealth spy plane that reportedly is under
development.
   The new jet will fly even farther out of reach of hostile forces,
hurtling at about five times the speed of sound _ nearly twice as
fast as the SR-71 _ to more than 100,000 feet, news reports say.
   Moreover, the new plane is so shrouded in stealth technology that
it will go undetected as it careens over other nations, according to
the reports. The stealth technology, still largely secret, has grown
far more sophisticated in the two decades since the design of the
SR-71, which was built with radar-absorbing materials and
beam-deflecting curves on its body.
   With the new jet still under development, along with its F-19
fighter and B-2 bomber counterparts, it is the SR-71 that continues
to collect information for the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Recent missions reportedly have included flights over the Persian
Gulf and the Arabian Sea to provide data to U.S. warships operating
in the area. Its cameras can photograph 100,000 square miles an
hour, revealing the terrain in enough detail to, say, make out a
license plate, according to the Air Force.

   The recent training mission observed by the news crew began at
Beale, with the pilot and reconnaissance systems operator arriving
three hours before takeoff for physicals, breakfast, briefings, and
donning of $100,000 spacesuits that include toilet facilities.
   A van like those used to take astronauts to launch pads carried
the men to the SR-71.
   Fuel that is not particularly flammable dripped to the ground
from half-full tanks, which would fully seal only after the aircraft
expanded in the heat of flight.
   Equipment screamed as it ignited the SR-71's twin turbojets,
which belched greenish-blue flames and 100-foot streams of
shimmering heat just idling.
   Finally, the Blackbird blasted down the runway, then skyward, in
a crackling thunder that shook the ground.
   Some two hours later, those aboard the KC-135 Stratotanker again
saw the delta-winged Blackbird, this time over a practice refueling
corridor some 25,000 feet above southern Idaho's snowed-capped
mountains.
   The refueling boom operator laid in the belly of the tanker at
its tail, staring out the back through portals as he helped guide
the boom into the 107-foot-long Blackbird.
   Within minutes, the second half of the SR-71's fuel load _ too
heavy a burden for its liftoff _ was gushing between the coupled
planes, which were traveling at 500 mph.
   Explained tanker navigator, Lt. Phil Campbell: ``We're going as
fast as we can and he's going as slow as he can.''
   Aerial refueling provides the Blackbird its global range. A
mission can keep an SR-71 in the air for 12 hours, entering hostile
territory and leaving it to refuel perhaps four or five times, says
Orcutt, SR-71 squadron commander at Beale.
   Tanker crews are somewhat jealous of attention focused on the
Blackbird and its close-knit crews: ``Everything is always SR this,
SR that,'' griped one tanker crew member.
   But both tanker and Blackbird crews acknowledge a mutual respect:
``Tankers have gone the extra mile in many cases to reach an SR-71
in trouble,'' says wing commander Graham.
   Many of the Blackbird crew members are family men, with the
youngest in their early 30s. For most, it's their last active-duty
flying assignment.
   Judy Bozek, the 31-year-old wife of Maj. Blair Bozek, an SR-71
crewman, was aboard the tanker watching. ``I worry,'' she says,
``but you sort of get numb to the fear. Seeing him today made it
worse. I can visualize it now.''
   Orcutt, who has flown 80 Blackbird missions in five years, says
he experienced an in-flight emergency that could have led to an
explosion. Such dramas are doubly tense because pilots are flying
over hostile territory.
   Blackbird pilots say their background helps them survive. Crews
usually have a decade of flying experience before they can compete
for the program. If accepted, they train for another year.
   Even on the ground, dangers persist. Former airman Bruce Ott was
sent to prison in 1986 for passing an SR-71 unit personnel list to
FBI agents posing as Soviet spies.
   Indeed, the role of the SR-71 in world affairs apparently remains
significant. Department of Defense officials say aircraft are still
needed to gather intelligence because of the limits of satellite
surveillance, according to news reports.
   But SR-71s are becoming more scarce and the prototype photo
reconnaissance planes, the glider-like U-2s, are even older and less
capable. There are reportedly only nine of the 30 original SR-71s
still in operation. Some have crashed; others have simply worn out.
   Even so, the military plans cutbacks in the SR-71 squadron
operated by the Strategic Air Command out of Beale and its forward
fields at Mildenhall, a Royal Air Force installation in England, and
at Kadena Air Base on the Japanese island of Okinawa.
   Wing commander Graham says he has been told four Blackbirds will
be deactivated in fiscal 1989, which would reportedly save the Air

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A delegation from the U.S. Human Rights
Commission will visit Cuba this summer, at Cuba's invitation, to
investigate assertions of human rights abuses in the communist
country. That's a sort of compromise that grew out of a meeting of
the commission in Geneva, with both Cuba and the United States
claiming a diplomatic victory.

   It was less bloody than the Bay of Pigs, less
suspenseful than the Cuban missile crisis. But a diplomatic
confrontation this year plainly showed the unchanging nature of one
of the world's more enduring rivalries: the United States vs. Cuba.
   The scene was the annual U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva
and the outcome of the panel's seven-week winter session might
appear mundanely unremarkable: a commission delegation, at Cuba's
invitation, will visit the island sometime this summer to examine
the state of human rights.
   But that action culminated more than a year of extraordinary
efforts by the United States to call Cuba to account on the rights
issue and equally intense maneuvering by Cuba to counter the U.S.
campaign.
   There was enough ambiguity in the outcome to permit both sides to
claim victory.
   ``Pure gold,'' said Dennis Goodman, a State Department official,
summing up the result.
   ``The most overwhelming political and moral defeat the Reagan
administration ever suffered'' in Geneva, a Cuban Communist Party
daily said.
   The session was memorable for a number of reasons. There were
Cuban allegations that United States tried to bribe commission
members in a frantic pursuit of votes and American assertions that
countries that voted against Cuba could face a wave of
Cuban-sponsored terrorism.
   There was also the presence of a former political prisoner from
Cuba as chief U.S. delegate at Geneva _ an appointment which stunned
President Fidel Castro. He said America was allowing itself to be
represented by a convicted terrorist. ``Shameless,'' he called it.
   The struggle brought into focus the U.S. view that Cuba has a
deplorable yet largely ignored human rights record and Cuba's own
contention that no Third World country has done more to protect the
rights of its citizens than has Cuba since the 1959 revolution.
   As the State Department sees it, there is ``an aggressive,
systematic and institutionalized denial of human rights in virtually
every form'' in Cuba.
   Then there is Castro's view: ``There is no single country in
which human rights are respected more carefully.''
   Both countries expended large diplomatic and political resources
in their campaigns. Commission members agonized over what they
regarded as a no-win choice.
   That dilemma was avoided when a resolution proposed by the United
States was superseded by an alternate proposal drawn up by Cuba in
cooperation with four Latin American countries and introduced during
the final days of the session.
   The U.S. resolution was drafted in moderate language in an
attempt by American representatives to garner broad support. At no
point did it directly accuse Cuba of violating human rights.
   But Cuba lobbied vigorously against the resolution, apparently to
avoid the stigma of approval for a measure sponsored by its
arch-enemy.
   Working in secret, Cuba and Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Peru
came up with the alternate proposal, calling for a visit to Cuba at
Cuba's invitation this summer.
   This alternative eventually was approved with U.S. support. At
first, however, American delegates reacted with surprise and anger
to the new proposal, leaving the impression that they would have
preferred an up-or-down vote on their own.
   Many Third World countries that felt caught in the middle of
U.S.-Cuban political war were elated at having been spared having a
painful choice between Washington and Havana.
   The Cubans maintained they had nothing to hide and that they
showed their good will by inviting a commission delegation for an
inspection tour. They said they would never be pressured into
accepting a human rights investigating team and they interpreted the
withdrawal of the U.S. proposal as a victory.
   ``They (the United States) sustained the most overwhelming defeat
that could have been inflicted on them,'' said Raul Roa Kouri, head
of the Cuban delegation.
   That claim seemed a bit exaggerated. U.S. officials pointed out
that were it not for the U.S. effort to highlight the Cuban issue,
no alternate proposal would have been introduced.
   Armando Valladares, the Cuban-born former political prisoner who
led the American delegation, said, ``We consider it a triumph for
human rights.''
   The administration's appointment of Valladares as delegation
head, with the rank of ambassador, contributed greatly to the
contentious atmosphere at Geneva.
   The administration saw in Valladares a symbol of what it regarded
as the area of Cuba's greatest vulnerability on the human rights
issue: its treatment of political prisoners.
   Valladares spent 22 years in Cuban prisons before his release in
1982 through the intercession of French President Francois
Mitterand. He described his long ordeal in a 1986 book, ``Against
All Hope,'' a brutal account of the systematic abuse, including
torture, that he claimed to have suffered during his long
confinement.
   As evidence of torture, he points to broken bones that never
healed properly. He attributes scars on his left hand to hungry rats
who shared his prison cell. He says a lack of pencils in prison
forced him to write a poem in his own blood.
   Cuba has portrayed Valladares as a loyal servant in the
pre-revolutionary police forces who became an anti-Castro terrorist
afterward.
   Castro expressed astonishment at Valladares' appointment, telling
an NBC interviewer in Feburary, ``You have turned...a terrorist who
was arrested with a bag of dynamite supplied to him by the U.S.
Embassy, you have made him head of the U.S. delegation. Never in
history had such a shameless thing been seen.''
   Valladares denied he was a member of the police force of the
rightist dictatorship which governed Cuba before 1959. He has said
that Cuban documents purporting to prove his membership in the
police force were fabricated.
   Such was Cuba's antipathy to Valladares that Cuban diplomats in
several capitals last Feburary distributed a 38-page pamphlet
entitled, ``The 15 State Department lies about Valladares.''
   The U.S. delegation went to Geneva determined to avoid a repeat
of the 1987 session when a similar attempt to call attention to
Cuba's human rights performance was defeated, 19-18, on a proposal
by India to set aside the U.S. resolution.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: U..S. resolution.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Many American officials reacted bitterly in the aftermath,
particularly to the votes of five Latin American democracies which
refused to back the U.S. position.
   As U.S. officials described it, the Venezuelan delegate had
received instructions from his foreign ministry to support the
Indian motion. Shortly before the vote, however, Venezuelan
President Jaime Lusinchi sent word to Geneva that he wanted his
delegate to oppose the Indian proposal.
   Aware of Lusinchi's efforts, U.S. delegates informed the
Venezuelan of the change and pleaded with him to double-check his
instructions. He refused and, as it turned out, his vote in support
of the Indian resolution was decisive.
   In Latin America, only Costa Rica sided with the United States.
Argentina, Colombia and Peru joined Venezuela in support of the
Indian proposal. Brazil abstained.
   This year, as he did in 1987, President Reagan sent letters
asking for support for the U.S. resolution to several presidents
whose countries are commission members. A number of foreign
ministers received similar letters from Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.
   The administration felt that over the years the commission had
focused disproportionate attention on anti-communist states, such as
South Africa, Israel and Chile, whilegenerally ignoring abuses in
Soviet bloc states.
   It found Cuba to be an irresistible target.
   Except for occasional periods, U.S.-Cuban relations have been
profoundly strained during the Reagan administration. At Geneva, the
administration saw perhaps its last opportunity to strike a damaging
propaganda blow at Cuba before leaving office.
   To demonstrate that the U.S. resolution had backing outside the
administration, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Dante Fascell, D-Fla., and the panel's ranking minority member,
William Broomfield, R-Mich., spent a day in Geneva lobbying for the
U.S. proposal.
   Geneva was abuzz with rumors that the United States was
threatening retaliatory measures against countries that opposed the
U.S. position.
   Roa Kouri, the head of the Cuban delegation, accused U.S.
officials of paying $50,000 bribes for a favorable vote. There were
press reports that Robert Gelbard, a deputy assistant secretary of
state, promised military and debt repayment assistance to Argentina
during two visits to Buenos Aires shortly before the March 10
showdown in Geneva. Gelbard dismissed the reports as ``Cuban
disinformation.''
   Goodman said it was the Cubans who were engaging in intimidation.
He said representatives of several countries indicated sympathy for
the U.S. position but refrained from endorsing it because they
feared Cuban retaliation.
   Particularly galling to U.S. officials was the casual cooperation
at Geneva between the Cuban and Colombian delegations on the
proposal that was eventually approved. The administration maintains
that Cuba has been supporting Colombia's M-19 guerrilla group for
years.
   Ramon Sanchez Parodi, who has headed the Cuban diplomatic mission
in Washington for 10 years, said one reason Cuba agreed to an
alternate resolution was to shield Third World countries that felt
uncomfortable about having to make a choice between Washington and
Havana.
   Goodman felt the Cuban offer to invite a rights delegation
backfired on them. He said that the original Cuban proposal called
for Cuba to pay the expenses of the delegation, thus enabling Cuban
authorities to exercise control over the panel's activities.
   What made the Cuban proposal acceptable to the United States was
the intercession of commission chairman Alioune Sene of Senegal, he
said.
   As Goodman described it, Sene accepted the Cuban invitation but
said that the visit would be carried out under standard U.N.
practices _ meaning that the commission, and not the Cubans, will
foot the bill.
   Goodman predicted that the commission will deliver a ``split
decision'' on Cuba's rights practices, noting that an East bloc
representative, a Bulgarian, will be a member. In addition, there
will be one delegate each from Asia, Latin America, the Western
democracies and Africa joining the Senegalese chairman.
   The commission is expected to spend five days in Cuba but its
members are authorized to gather information about human rights in
Cuba from any source both on the island and outside, including the
large community of Cuban exiles.
   One of the principal guideposts for assessing Cuba's rights
performance is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, approved
by the U.N. General Assembly a few years after the United Nations
was founded in 1945.
   Cuba would appear to be most vulnerable on the sections of the
declaration dealing with freedom, including the rights to freedom of
thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression.
   But Cuba comes out stronger than most other countries on certain
other rights spelled out in the document. Among them are the right
to work and to receive an education. Few Third World countries
compare with Cuba's record in providing employment and access to
schooling. Still, well over 1 million Cubans have fled the island
since the revolution.
   In the February interview, Castro dismissed suggestions that
Cuba's rights record needs improvement.
   ``There is absolute respect for the human rights of citizens,''
he said. ``There is no single country in which human rights are
respected more carefully.
   ``Ask a worker, ask a peasant, ask a university student, ask
intellectuals if there has ever been an assassination, a missing
person, a tortured person in this country. That is a lie.''
   The State Department Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian
Affairs has a different view. In a December 1986 report, it said:
   ``Life in Cuba today is characterized by an aggressive systematic
and institutionalized denial of human rights in virtually every
form...Freedom of expression does not exist. No criticism of the
basic policies and Marxist-Leninist orientation of the government,
party, or its leadership is permitted. Telephones are routinely
tapped and mail opened ... Those who choose the slightest form of
political resistance usually pay a very high price: arrest, abuse,
torture and cruel and unusual punishment.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a depressed area of western Pennsylvania,
where the unemployment rate is double the national average, the
mushroom has become the mainstay of the economy. Picking mushrooms
is back-breaking work, and some days the pickers never see daylight,
but most are grateful just to have a job.

   The search for jobs often ends
underground in this small western Pennsylvania town, where workers
who once manned assembly lines now pick mushrooms in the dark
caverns of a limestone mine.
   ``At least we have one industry left in our area that pays a
half-decent wage,'' says Ray Denny, 50, of nearby Fenelton. ``It
pays enough that we can get by on.''
   With more than 970 workers, the Moonlight Mushrooms Inc. mine is
the largest private employer in Armstrong County, about 50 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, where the continuing shutdown of steel
mills and factories has hit hard. The county unemployment rate was
11.4 percent in February, double the nation's jobless rate of 5.7
percent that month.
   ``Any time there's any opening in this area that pays $5 or more,
that employer almost always is overwhelmed by the number s.
   ``It's tiresome work,'' says Tom Parisi, 34, of Templeton. ``It's
hard on your legs and you're bending all day. You stoop a lot.''
   Workers don't talk much while they pick, and soft music piped in
around growing areas penetrates the stillness.
   Pickers ride to and from the mine in electric carts and head for
a brightly lit oasis to eat, an underground lunchroom with vending
machines.
   Visitors from above frequently are asked, ``What's the weather
like?''
   Many pickers have a spouse, parent or child working beside them.
Zema's grandfather began working at the mine in 1937 and his mother
has worked her way from picker to assistant manager.
   Zema and Parisi had worked in nearby Butler at the Pullman
Standard box car plant, which closed in 1982, idling 2,800 workers.
   ``I made a few dollars more in there than what I am now,'' says
Zema, who painted railroad cars for Pullman. ``I miss the whole job,
period.''
   Like many pickers, Marge Lasher, 34, of Ford City says
competition from foreign imports led to the demise of her former
job. She was laid off from her assembly-line job at a garment
factory.
   In July 1985, the mushroom company closed its nearby 200-acre
West Winfield mine, where it began operations a half-century ago.
The 250 workers who were laid off eventually were hired at the
current mine, bought in 1961 after being abandoned by USX Corp., Ms.
Lahmers said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A girl of 8, she was born with a black, hairy
blotch covering much of her face, a growth doctors describe as much
like ape skin. But thanks to a Denver plastic surgeon and an
organization called ``Friends of Man,'' Monica Tovar is being
transformed, a process that will take years to complete.

<TEXT>
   Monica Tovar, a young Mexico City girl born with a
disfiguring facial growth, has been given a ``new face'' by a Denver
plastic surgeon who donated his skills.
   The shy, 8-year-old has endured playmates' taunts, two operations
in Mexico, three in Denver and the prospect of others, during what
will be a 10-year project to remove completely scars and blemishes.
   ``When she is 16 or 17 and ready to date, I'll be finished,''
said her surgeon, Dr. Thomas Gargan, chief of plastic surgery at
Rose Medical Center.
   ``Monica is a unique child,'' he said as he showed slides
illustrating how Monica looked before and after the $10,000
procedure.
   ``This little girl with such beautiful hair has impressed me with
her courage. There is something that tears at your heartstrings when
you operate on a little girl like Monica.''
   Monica was born with a congenital hairy nevus, a black, hairy
blotch covering much of the left side of her face.
   Gargan said such a growth, occuring in fewer than 100,000 births,
is ``just like ape skin or chimpanzee skin. It is something like a
mole and as much as 8.5 percent of them develop into cancerous
melanomas.
   ``I've never seen one this bad,'' he said. ``Traditionally, you
cut out a growth such as Monica's and you put on a thick skin graft.
The problem is that it looks like a patch. The color doesn't match
and there is some contraction in the corners.''
   So Gargan undertook a relatively new procedure beginning in June
1986, when he inserted an inflatable bag under the skin of her neck,
along the jaw line.
   Using a valve placed behind Monica's ear, Gargan injected saline
solution into the bag once a week. As the bag expanded, it stretched
Monica's skin.
   ``Usually, kids don't tolerate the skin expander very well,'' the
doctor said. ``She cried a little at times, but she was so brave.
   ``Eventually, the skin became so thin you could almost see
through it. I felt I had gone as far as I could.''
   So, in September 1986, Gargan cut away the growth. The skin which
had been stretched, amounting to a large flap, was pulled up and
over the area where the nevus had been.
   The surgery was extensive on Monica's face, neck and chest,
involving hundreds of stitches.
   After the surgery, Monica had to wear a compression mask over her
head for one year, 23 hours a day. Made of a woven elastic material,
the mask had openings for her eyes, nose, mouth and ears, and was
kept tight by Velcro fasteners.
   ``The mask minimizes scarring and squeezes the swelling out of
the flap,'' Gargan explained. During that year, Monica's long, dark
hair had to be kept crew-cut short.
   After the year, Gargan performed a second graft under Monica's
bottom lip, and in time he will do a chin implant because ``her chin
flattened out a bit from the flap being pulled up.''
   Gargan says more work will be needed in the years ahead as Monica
matures and her adult facial features develop.
   Monica, speaking partly in Spanish and partly in English, says
she is happy the growth is gone and doesn't mind facing more surgery
because she knows it will make her look better.
   But Monica admits she would like to return to Mexico. ``I want to
go tomorrow. Our living is so different here,'' she said in the
cramped, three-room apartment she shares with her parents, brother
and two sisters.
   ``I miss Mexico and my friends,'' Monica says, but she admits she
likes American TV and amusement parks.
   Monica's parents, Francisco and Magda Tovar, are working at
menial jobs to support the family. In Mexico City, Francisco was an
administrative accountant and the family lived comfortably.
   ``Our standard of living is lower here,'' Mrs. Tovar said in
Spanish. ``But we are happy to do it for Monica. We will do
everything we can. We hope some day we can help other children.''
   In addition to Gargan's donated services, an organization called
``Friends of Man'' has helped with the medical costs. Monica's
parents are now at least partially covered by medical insurance.
   Monica completed the fourth grade this month and was looking
forward to ``a lot of swimming.''
   Her favorite class was art, she says, because ``I get to draw
with crayons, Magic Markers and so on. I really enjoy that.''
   Gargan last saw Monica in April when he re-contoured her chin. He
also ``revised the scar along the left side of the nose to bring it
in so it fit in with the crease formed by the nose and the cheek so
it is less noticable. The re-contouring was to help define the chin
more clearly.
   ``She is an extremely courageous little girl,'' he says. ``What
has impressed me so much is the courage she has shown despite
multiple, complex operations, wearing that `balloon' on her face for
so long and having such pain. She went through all of that like a
trooper.''

   Anne Schedeen, by her own calculation, figures
she became famous a few weeks ago.
   ``I went to the hardware store in my jeans,'' she says. ``My hair
was sticking out all over. This man comes up to me and says, `Oh,
you're Kate Tanner.' It went like that for the rest of the day.
   ``The other day I answered the door in my bathrobe. A man says,
`You're the woman on ``ALF.''' I'd never been recognized before. The
recognition came when the show started hitting the Top 10 in the
ratings.''
   Schedeen stars on NBC's ``ALF,'' a hit comedy about a furry,
wisecracking alien from the planet Melmac who moves in with a
typical American family. Max Wright also stars as her husband,
Willie Tanner, and Andrea Elson and Benji Gregory as their children,
Lynn and Brian. And ALF is played by, well, ALF.
   ``I consider myself lucky,'' Schedeen says. ``For years I've been
able to make a wonderful living and retain my anonymity. It helped
me hit the antique stores, which is a passion of mine. It's a little
hard to bargain if the store salesman knows you're on a hit show.''
   The actress has more than 60 replicas of the Statue of Liberty,
including one 8-foot version in the back yard. ``I like to say the
people of France gave it to me,'' she says. ``I have them in
thermometers and lamps. They're all old. I only bought one new one
during the centennial, and it felt like cheating. The old ones are
hard to find. People keep them, but I find one in a flea market
every now and again.
   ``It seems like there's nothing I can't collect. I collect
architectural details, like moldings, cornices, newel posts. My
husband says if it's heavy I want it.''
   She's married to agent Chris Barrett. Her sister, Sara Schedeen,
is also an agent with the same company.
   Schedeen has starred in one other series, ABC's ``Paper Dolls,''
and in six pilots that never got on the air. She was a contract
player at Universal Studios, where she had a recurring role on
``Emergency!'' and was a guest star on numerous series, as well as
in several TV movies and feature films.
   ``When `ALF' came along it was another pilot season,'' she says.
``I kept reading scripts. I almost got involved with one, then
withdrew at the last minute. Then I read `ALF.' I said, `This is
funny. It makes me laugh.' I met the people involved, I met ALF, and
became more convinced I wanted to do it. That little alien made me
laugh.''
   Schedeen doesn't say much about ALF. No one connected with the
show mentions the ``p'' word. Meaning puppet. ALF is kept under
wraps, but it's been said it takes more people to operate ALF than a
Boeing 747.
   ``What's ALF really like?'' she asks. ``Just like he is on TV.
Rude, obnoxious, crude, but a good dancer. Generous, but in a weird
way. When my husband and I moved into our new house ALF sent over a
truckload of venetian blinds. All one size, 30-by-42.
   ``He has bad personal habits. He clips his toenails on the set.
He borrows things and doesn't return them. I don't want the
toothbrush back, but it's too much when you walk in your dressing
room and he's taken the coffee table.''
   Schedeen grew up on a farm outside of Portland, Ore., and began
acting ``with teapots and flowers'' at the age of 6. The family name
was originally Sjodin, but got changed somewhere on the journey from
Sweden. Her first agent wanted to change it again, but she said no
way because it would be fun for the whole family.
   She took acting lessons at the Portland Civic Theater. Her first
professional job, which paid only room and board, was in a dinner
theater on the island of Kauai. She studied at Portland State
University and Fort Wright College in Spokane, Wash., then took off
to backpack across Europe.
   ``When I came back I settled in New York,'' she says. ``I didn't
even know there was a trade newspaper. I called a girl I had acted
with in Portland and said I'd come to New York to act. She said,
`Oh, no!' I think she was responding to all the problems she knew I
would go through. Getting an agent, getting to the right classes,
getting a survival job and waiting for the magic to start.
   ``It was a long wait. I sold clothes, modeled clothes, was a shoe
model. I played in summer stock and did a commercial. Then I got
signed by a big agent. Within a month I had a contract with
Universal. I thought I'd come out here, take fencing lessons, drive
a small Thunderbird and sit by the swimming pool. Instead, I was the
daughter on `Marcus Welby, M.D.'''
   Schedeen says she'll never forget the time that show's producer,
David Victor, turned to her and said in a thick German accent,
``Remember, Anne, tears are liquid Nielsen ratings.''

   Christopher Plummer is beginning to think that
Shakespeare's ``Macbeth'' is jinxed, as the old theater superstition
has it.
   He has a knee injury, a neck injury, a broken nose and some
missing teeth, all suffered since he signed on for his latest tour
as the Scottish king.
   Plummer, who is starring opposite Glenda Jackson in ``Macbeth''
on Broadway, for a limited run through July 3 at the Mark Hellinger
Theater, suffered his first mishap in Baltimore when he severed
cartilage and tore ligaments in his knee. He rehearsed on a new set
on crutches for days and performed in a cast.
   He lost a couple of teeth, yet to be replaced, in Toronto.
``Somebody banged into me in a blackout, going about 75 m.p.h.,'' he
says. ``I managed to continue the performance. They weren't the
essential teeth you need to speak.
   ``He banged into my head. My nose was broken for the third time.
Now I have a deviated septum as a result of that charming incident.
   ``And I developed that awful disintegrating disc on the neck. It
presses on the motor nerve and makes life miserable. I was in a neck
brace in Boston. I would take it off and I would be lopsided. I
found it difficult to stand straight. Now I'm much freer. I still go
to therapy.''
   Plummer says he'll ``go into the garage'' for repairs in July.
   Theater people have long considered ``Macbeth'' bad luck. No
actor ever has launched a career playing the title role. And
thespians are careful to say ``the Scottish play'' and never
``Macbeth'' anytime they're inside a theater.
   ``Maybe the play IS jinxed,'' Plummer laughs.
   Jinxed or not, this production of ``Macbeth'' has been drawing
good audiences.
   ``I think audiences want to hear good words spoken well and to
see good theater again,'' Plummer says. ``They've seen a lot of
mediocre stuff. It made us do extraordinarily well on the road _
Glenda, myself and Shakespeare.''
   Macbeth, who murders Scotland's king, Duncan, and becomes king
early in the play, is called by Plummer ``an intensely modern man.
Any ambitious young tycoon and anybody in the power-play game who
wants to rise can understand him. In every generation there are
Macbeths.
   ``Macbeth's conscience doesn't last very long. He consults his
evil psychiatrists _ the three witches _ who show him the easiest
way to power and to madness. Power-mad people can't stop once they
start because too many people know where all the bodies are buried.
   ``I think Macbeth is always aware; that is the tragedy. It would
be easy to play someone who is mad. It's more difficult to play
someone on the verge of madness.
   ``Macbeth is not as old as I am. When you're over 50, vaulting
ambition is no longer part of your psyche. Some of the youthful
anger you have when you're a young actor has vanished ... An actor
should be able to rustle it up at a moment's notice. That youthful
anger is very important to Macbeth.''
   One critic who saw Plummer in ``Macbeth'' in 1962 at the
Stratford Festival in his native Canada thought it was angrier and
better.
   ``I think he is generally wrong,'' Plummer says. ``Technically,
I'm much better equipped now. I understand the role much better. I
think I make it much clearer.
   ``It's difficult to make it clear, particularly in the beginning.
Scholars have said there are two major scenes missing. I take the
first part of the play much slower than most Macbeths do. I let the
audience come to me a bit and see what I'm thinking. In the first
soliloquy, he has received the news that he's to be king. I try and
take that as slowly and clearly as I possibly can. It does help.
   ``The unjust thing about the play is that the real Macbeth in the
12th century was a good king. He followed Duncan; he didn't kill
him.''
   This production of ``Macbeth'' had two set designers and three
directors. The first director, Kenneth Frankel, Plummer says,
``Obviously couldn't see it through. We were going to get into
artistic differences very soon. We opened rather shaky, with only
three-and-a-half weeks of rehearsal. `Macbeth' needs six weeks. What
audiences saw was us still rehearsing. At least he got it on.''
Robin Phillips, who could only give limited time, stepped in as
director and, Plummer says, ``Whipped up an exciting souffle on the
stage. But certain things he began so brilliantly were left in the
air. Zoe Caldwell came in and pushed the interpretation forward.
   ``Zoe is wonderful at bringing you back to the truth of the text.
After you've gone so many journeys out and around it as you have to
do with these great roles, you need someone to remind you of the
simplicity.''
   Once when he and Miss Jackson were vigorously discussing their
roles, Plummer says, somebody thought they were fighting and
informed the news media. ``We haven't said one lousy word to each
other since the beginning,'' he says. ``We get on very well. I asked
Glenda if she minded and she said, `No. It sells tickets.' I think
it did.''

   In the three decades since six West
European nations signed the Treaty of Rome creating the European
Economic Community, the organization has doubled in size.
   France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg founded the organization in 1957.
   Britain, Ireland and Denmark joined in 1973, after having been
blackballed by the France of President Charles de Gaulle in 1961.
   Greece became the 10th member in 1981, and Spain and Portugal
joined in 1986.
   Last year Turkey submitted an application for membership but
negotiations have not yet begun, partly due to Greek opposition.
Morocco in North Africa also applied last year but was told it did
not qualify since it is not in Europe.

<TEXT>
   Efforts to unite Europe have been alive
for centuries. Napoleon and Hitler tried it by force.
   Not until after the devastation of World War II did a peaceful
approach catch on.
   Jean Monnet, a French economist, and Robert Schuman, a French
foreign minister, are considered the fathers of the European Coal
and Steel Community, a forerunner of today's European Economic
Community, or Common Market.
   The community celebrates its ``birthday'' each year on May 9, the
date in 1950 on which Schuman formally proposed pooling the coal and
steel industries of France and West Germany and setting up a
European common market in coal. A little less than seven years later
the EEC was born.
   These are some other famous figures in EEC history:
   _Paul-Henri Spaak, a Belgian statesman, engineered the so-called
Spaak Report, which drew up a blueprint for developing a European
union. The report was adopted on May 29, 1956, and led directly to
the Treaty of Rome that created the EEC on March 25, 1957.
   _Etienne Davignon, a Belgian member of the EEC Commission in the
early 1980s. He masterminded the Davignon Plan for spending billions
of dollars to revitalize Europe's most basic industry: steel.
   _Jacques Delors, a Frenchman and current president of the EEC
Commission. He is credited with leading the community into perhaps
its most dynamic phase of commerical and monetary integration.

<HEAD>The Artists: Erie Mills Was a Sure Shot for the Met</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Metropolitan Opera was so certain about
soprano Erie Mills that it offered the lyric-coloratura a contract
for its performances in Japan before she made her actual Met debut
last Thanksgiving as Blondchen in Mozart's ``The Abduction From the
Seraglio.''
   In Japan, where ticket prices run as high as $265 for an opera
performance, she sang Olympia, the wind-up doll, in ``The Tales of
Hoffmann,'' during the Met's May 25-June 10 tour. She also was
standby for Susanna in ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' She'll sing both
roles at the Met in the 1989-90 season.
   Miss Mills stands 5 feet 2, and her voice is light, perfect for
such parts as Blondchen and Adele in ``Die Fledermaus,'' which she
will also sing at the Met next season.
   ``It helps that my voice goes with my small size,'' she says.
``Tenors always love me because I'm short. They can usually tower
over me.''
   Her prediction is that her voice won't get a lot heavier as she
gets older and her repertoire will stay about the same.
   ``I have decided there should be four, five or six roles that I
do as well or better than anybody else,'' she says. ``I want to
become known in the international scene for them.''
   She made that decision at her first big job at the Chicago Lyric
Opera in 1979.
   ``Alfredo Kraus was singing `Faust,' opening the season,'' she
recalled. ``I thought, `This guy is incredible.' I think he was in
his 50s.
   ``Every time the Chicago Lyric did `Rigoletto' they wanted him
for the Duke. If they couldn't get him, they'd take Pavarotti. They
called him first for `Werther' and `Faust.' I thought, `That's how I
want to be, knowing what I do well and doing it very well.'
   ``When they cast Zerbinetta (in `Ariadne auf Naxos'), Sophie (in
`Der Rosenkavalier'), `The Daughter of the Regiment' or Susanna, I
want them to think of me. It has taken a while to find out what
those roles are.'' She made her Vienna State Opera debut last
September as Zerbinetta.
   Miss Mills, a native of Granite City, Ill., sang art songs at the
College of Wooster and thought she wanted to be another Elly
Ameling, the Dutch lieder singer.
   ``Then my practical self took over,'' she said. ``I realized you
don't make a living in this country singing recitals. You have to
make it in opera.''
   The summer of 1977, after she received a master's degree from the
University of Illinois, she was an apprentice at the Lake George,
N.Y., Opera Festival. Later, she went to the Houston Grand Opera's
studio, and in 1979 she sang ``The Daughter of the Regiment'' in the
Kennedy Center Summer Opera.
   Until her Met debut last November, her biggest break was joining
the New York City Opera in 1982 and triumphing in Bernstein's
``Candide.'' She's often asked to sing the coloratura ``Glitter and
Be Gay'' from ``Candide'' at benefits.
   Many opera stars have ``crossed over'' by performing popular
music; Miss Mills did it the other way. She paid for college by
singing in musical comedies at the outdoor St. Louis Municipal Opera
for six summers, performed in the 1985 ``Follies'' concert and
record and did ``Naughty Baby'' on the 1987 TV George Gershwin
tribute. Now, she seldom sings popular music but includes Gershwin,
Irving Berlin and Cole Porter songs as recital encores.
   The soprano and physicist Thomas Rescigno will mark their second
wedding anniversary June 24 with her in Japan and him in Pleasanton,
Calif.
   When he wondered how he could send a gift, she says, ``I told him
he was going to get hit with my pearl bill.''
   Rescigno is from a family long connected with music. His brother,
Joseph, heads the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee, where Miss Mills
sang ``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' this season, and his uncle, Nicola,
heads the Dallas Opera, where she'll debut in the 1990-91 season.
   Her first name comes from her great-grandmother whose name, it
was discovered when Miss Mills was an infant, was Arie, not Erie.
Her name was left Erie but her mother pronounces it Arie.
   Many Mills and Rescigno family members attended her Met debut on
Thanksgiving night.
   ``Normally I claim I don't sing as well on opening night as I do
at dress rehearsal,'' the artist said. ``That night I sang better on
opening than I had at dress rehearsal. It thrilled me no end.
   ``I must be becoming an artist because lately dress rehearsals
haven't been as good as opening performances.''
   After the Met tour in Japan and a week's vacation in Hong Kong
with her husband, Miss Mills will sing this summer with the New York
City Opera in a new production of ``The Barber of Seville'' and in
``Lucia di Lammermoor'' for the first time in New York.
   Her goal these days is to spend more time at home.
   ``I'm married and have a home life,'' she said. ``I enjoy that. I
don't know how some singers go 53 weeks a year. I think even if I
didn't have a husband I wouldn't do that. But living alone does make
it less neat to stay at home. I'd say, `I might as well be working.'
I did that 10 years before I got married.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Julio Iglesias Craves Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Julio Iglesias sold out nine shows at the
6,000-seat Radio City Music Hall, and he signed autographs at a
nearby record store that had lines around the block.
   But as far as the international superstar is concerned, that
still doesn't make him feel like a success in the United States.
   The native of Madrid, Spain, says success will only be his in
America when he's listed in the pop sections of record stores
instead of being filed under ``foreign vocalists.''
   To this end, his new record for Columbia, ``Non Stop,'' is his
second done completely in English, and concerts on his current tour
include more singing in English.
   Another essential for success for Iglesias is that he feel goose
bumps of excitement at least once in a concert.
   ``If I don't get goose bumps, I get a very bad critique the next
day,'' he said.
   ``Sometimes on stage you don't reach people. You feel frustrated,
more than you can imagine. Sometimes they understand you. I prefer
goose bumps in the audience for two seconds more than 10 standing
ovations. Standing ovations can be provoked by three or four people
standing in front of the others. Goose bumps you feel, if you have
it, on your own.''
   His biggest hits in the United States have been duets: ``To All
the Girls I've Loved Before'' sung with Willie Nelson, and ``All of
Me'' with Diana Ross. Iglesias had intended not to do anymore, but
when Stevie Wonder wrote ``My Love'' for him, he couldn't resist
asking the composer to sing it with him.
   ``He came to my hotel room in Los Angeles with a little piano,''
said Iglesias, who had met Wonder at the Grammy Awards. ``He plays
this song without lyrics, in his own way, because he is a genius. I
said, `This is going to be difficult for me. I don't understand what
you're meaning in this song.'''
   Six months passed and Iglesias asked Wonder to play harmonica on
``Love Is on Our Side Again.'' Wonder also played ``My Love'' with
lyrics, and Iglesias started to work on it. ``It's not easy to sing.
The harmonies are even difficult for Stevie.
   ``The title `My Love' sounds superficial,'' he said. ``I think it
has the most beautiful words I ever sang. It's the first time I
think Stevie talks so directly about this disenfranchised situation.
He means people who are born without the opportunities of others.
   ``A Latino man and black man singing together _ it's a song to
put people together. We live in the moon sometimes; we need to get
back to reality.
   ``We're going to record it in Spanish, Italian and French. Stevie
has a musical sense of language. He can reach it phonetically, the
accent and everything.''
   Iglesias' 1988 tour, currently hitting 18 American cities,
already has taken him to South America, China, Japan, Australia, the
Philippines and Korea. On July 13, he goes to Europe and will return
to the United States on Sept. 14 for four additional concerts.
   In China, a two-hour TV concert was aired, the first there of a
Western performer.
   ``For me, it was one of the best experiences of my life, if not
the best one,'' Iglesias said.
   Iglesias is surprisingly unslick on stage, holding his microphone
in his left hand, reaching across himself with his right hand to tug
on his suit jacket, seeming hurt when shouts in Spanish request that
he cut the English. Women love him.
   ``I feel uncomfortable when they say sexy,'' Iglesias says. ``I
think after 20 years I proved my talent.''
   Though he is called the world's most popular singer, with
recordings in six languages and No. 1 hits in more than 90
countries, Iglesias said that two years ago he went to a
psychiatrist every day.
   ``I became crazier than I was,'' he said. ``I developed
depression and psychosomatic problems. But I went away from that.
Now I'm back. I don't need sleeping pills. I'm OK except I smoke too
much. I can't quit.''
   Learning English was difficult for the 44-year-old singer, who
started learning the language when he was 38. ``That's too old for
everything, I think, for a man,'' he said.
   ``When I go on stage now, I'm very happy. I think I can sing in
English, good or bad, like I sing in English all my life.
   ``Before, even when I used to do interviews, it took me seconds
to understand the question, translate it to Spanish, translate my
answer into English. At the end of the conversation, the writer was
also crazy.''
   Iglesias has been divorced since 1979 from Spanish journalist
Isabel Preysler, and has two sons and a daughter. Asked whether he
might marry again, he says, ``At my age it would have to be a
perfect combination between brains and feelings. To share a life in
an emotional way is not enough now. It doesn't mean I'm against
marriage. Maybe tomorrow I will get married.''
   His children have lived with him for the last three years, after
living with their mother.
   ``I'm a bad father,'' he said, because he has explained to his
children that singing comes first. ``They know there is nothing more
important in my life than my public. They have to understand I have
a life which is my work that would never take a second position in
my life.
   ``They know I care like crazy about them. I share with them as
much as I can physically, because I have a very busy life.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Tom Hayden Has No Regrets About Decade of
Defiance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Tom Hayden talks about the
1960s, vivid images flash in the mind's eye as they once did on TV
screens decades ago.
   Civil rights sit-ins. Anti-war protests. The Chicago riots.
Napalm. Tear gas.
   The '60s.
   Hayden speaks with nostalgia, some sadness but no regret about
the decade that planted his name in the public consciousness as a
radical firebrand, anti-war protester and defendant in the Chicago 8
conspiracy trial.
   He is 48 now, a man whose middle-aged life surprises no one more
than himself. He once thought it might never come. ``I thought I
would wind up dead or in jail. An internal exile was my expectation
until 1971,'' says Hayden.
   But here he is today, a California state assemblyman with a
strong constituency. A husband and father whose 15-year marriage to
actress Jane Fonda survived the critics. And now an author, telling
what he knows best _ the story of the '60s.
   His newly published memoir, ``Reunion'' (Random House, $22.50),
explains his role in that fiery time to a new generation including
his teen-age son, Troy, and Fonda's daughter, Vanessa.
   ``I'm not writing it to set history straight. I'm writing it to
set my life straight,'' Hayden said at his Santa Monica headquarters
where posters of Fonda and his lost hero, Robert F. Kennedy,
decorate the walls.
   He wants to put the past in order, he said, so he can get on with
the future.
   The assassination of Kennedy in 1968 was a turning point for
Hayden. He said it precipitated his plunge into deep cyncism about
America and determination to go forward with the Chicago anti-war
protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
   ``I went from Robert Kennedy's coffin into a very bleak and
bitter political view,'' said Hayden. ``I think it confirmed for me
that there was no future and brought out a lurking belief that this
was a really violent country and that I was headed into apocalyptic
times.''
   Police assaults on student demonstrators in Chicago confirmed his
belief.
   ``In 1968 I thought it was reasonable to anticipate a police
state,'' he recalled. ``But in 1972 the people who were running the
Democratic Party four years before were out and the people who were
in the streets were in. In the next year the people who wanted to
put me in jail began the road to jail themselves with Watergate.
   ``The radical pressure caused the reforms,'' Hayden says. ``But
it's fair to say the system reformed itself.''
   In his book, Hayden writes: ``Rarely, if ever, in American
history has a generation begun with higher ideals and experienced
greater trauma than those who lived fully the short time from 1960
to 1968.''
   Hayden was there at the start. In 1960, while a student at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, he was involved in formation of
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), then dedicated to
desegregating the South. By 1962, when Hayden began drafting the
landmark Port Huron Statement, SDS was dedicated to changing the
world.
   ``We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest
comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably at the
world we inherit,'' began the statement which outlined a plan for a
campus social movement which was revolutionary.
   Hayden is fond of analogizing the student movement that followed
to the American Revolution and the Civil War and believes it changed
America for the better. But he knows that antagonisms linger.
   ``The subject of Vietnam and the '60s is a very prickly issue,''
he concedes, and said he wrote ``carefully'' about his two trips to
North Vietnam and his wife's later visit to the enemy territory.
   ``I tried to convey that the Vietnam War was the catastrophe for
Americans of our generation,'' Hayden said, ``and in pursuit of an
end of the war I was driven to certain extremes that in retrospect
I'm not proud of.''
   However, Hayden says his detractors went overboard and he's
perplexed by their continuing attacks on him and Fonda. But those
attacks from a vocal few have not hurt him politically, he says.
He's been elected to his assembly seat three times and plans to seek
a fourth term.
   What led him back to the mainstream?
   First, he says, there was his realizaton that the movement was
turning violent and was ``a dead-end, an enclosed hothouse of
revolutionary politics where you become ever more obscure in the
pursuit of purity. ... If anything jolted me out of my revolutionary
politics it was when the Weathermen (a faction of SDS) supported
(Charles) Manson.''
   The second motivation was his relationship with a woman who had a
child.
   ``I found myself in love with parenting. So I couldn't go along
with the policy that chidren were a counter-revolutionary drag on
your commitment,'' he said. ``The third thing was that the system
was reformed and did work.''
   In retrospect, Hayden sees his path as circular.
   ``I feel I'm back to 1960,'' he says. ``I'm working on the reform
of colleges and universities, problems of poverty and housing,
trying to inspire apathetic people to register and vote ... and
trying to reform the Democratic Party.
   ``It's very similart monuments of Luxor, Egypt,
and have a final meeting Tuesday with President Hosni Mubarak before
ending his fourth Middle East mission of the year.
   Shultz briefed Assad on last week's U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow.
He told Arab reporters the United States and Soviet Union have
``agreed to continue to address ourselves to the Middle East
issues.''
   ``We will have some continuing discussions, probably before long,
on an intensive basis,'' Shultz said. ``It's not for the Soviet
Union and the United States to resolve the problems here. It's for
the countries in the region to resolve their problems.''
   He added, however, that the superpowers ``have a certain amount
of influence, and if we see some things in a parallel way it will
probably make an impact.''
   Washington has dropped its opposition to a Soviet role in a
Middle East peace conference but objects to an active part for
outside powers in negotiations between Israel and its Arab foes.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel opposes any Soviet role
but plans to meet the Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, at the United Nations. It will be the latest of
several recent contacts between the two countries, which do not have
formal diplomatic relations.
   Shultz has been unable to bridge the gap between Israel and the
Arabs over the U.S. peace proposals, which include an international
conference and trading Israeli-occupied land for peace.
   King Hussein of Jordan said Saturday that Israeli withdrawal from
occupied territories is a condition for talks. Shamir opposes
condition and has balked at Shultz's insistence on at least a
partial Israeli pullback.
   In comments to the Arab reporters, Shultz said both sides could
work with his proposal ``if people will cast aside their extreme
views, their illusions, and operate on the basis of reality.''
   The secretary said he considers the Arab demand for an
independent Palestinian nation ``unworkable'' and suggested ``a
confederation, or an attachment to another state.'' He said it could
be similar to an American state or a Swiss canton.
   About Lebanon, Shultz said he believed it ``important that
(presidential) elections go ahead'' as planned even if there is no
solution to the country's constitutional crisis.
   U.S. officials have welcomed Syria's military role in Lebanon's
Moslem areas and have worked with Syria in trying to win Christian
political concessions that might help calm the 13-year-old sectarian
civil war.
   There has been no sign, however, that the Lebanese Forces, the
main Christian militia, will accept any plan ending Christian
political dominance in a country that now has a Moslem majority.

<HEAD>Military Computers Vulnerable To Viruses, Just Like PCs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sophisticated weapon-system computers are
vulnerable to ``viruses'' just like business and personal computers,
but experts say efforts to fight such software sabotage are barely
beyond the planning stages.
   Viruses _ actually small strings of computer code _ can be
stealthily inserted into software programs, where they may lie
dormant for months or years before causing computers, and the
weapons they help control, to go haywire.
   ``Software attack, often best carried out with the aid of
well-placed insiders, is emerging as a coherent new type of
systematic offensive warfare,'' Scott A. Boorman, a Yale University
sociology professor, and Paul R. Levitt, a mathematician, wrote
recently in the military electronics journal Signal.
   ``It can be waged far removed in space and time from any
battlefield to affect not only combat outcomes, but also peacetime
balances of power,'' they wrote. It can ``strike key civilian
targets, such as electronic funds transfer, other financial and data
communications, air traffic control systems and even the
vote-tallying machinery at the heart of the democratic process.''
   Their article discussed the threat ``viruses'' pose to computers
used by the military and government agencies with a national
security mission.
   Within the last year, viruses have ``infected'' computers at
NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
information systems on Capitol Hill, George Washington University,
Lehigh University and Hebrew University in Jerusalem. They also have
slowed IBM's electronic mail system to a crawl and reportedly caused
video monitors in Silicon Valley to burst into flames, apparently by
speeding up the cycle speed of certain video functions.
   Tactics that can be used to disrupt computer operations include:
   _Viruses, essentially small programs that can hide in the
computer's operating system, giving orders that range from a
relatively benign message that flashes on the screen to destruction
of data files or erasure of disks. A virus differs from other
sabotage in that it clones itself and spreads.
   _``Trojan horses,'' programs that look and act like normal ones
but contain hidden commands that eventually take effect and cause
havoc.
   _``Logic bombs,'' small sets of instructions surreptitiously
entered into other software, where they remain undetected and
inactive until the computer arrives at a certain result during
normal computation.
   _``Time bombs,'' which go into action at a set date and time.
   The supersecret National Security Agency, based at Fort Meade,
Md., is responsible for safeguarding the security of U.S. government
computer systems. It has set up the National Computer Security
Center at Fort Meade to help the military, defense contractors and
other private companies cope with software warfare and other threats
to vital computer systems.
   Spokeswoman Pat Coulson said the NSA had no comment on the Signal
article.
   Michael Harrison, a computer science professor at the University
of California at Berkeley, said the center has developed criteria
for ``trusted computer system evaluation... This is a practical
attempt to decide what systems are more trustworthy than others.''
   Boorman and Levitt said much more needs to be done to develop
effective technical countermeasures, and to alert military
commanders as well as civilian managers. ``Strategic, tactical and
logistic planning to meet the software warfare challenge remains in
its infancy in many cases,'' they wrote.
   Harrison agrees. ``They're making some progress, but there's so
much further to go... The security techniques to deal with (software
sabotage) are developing but not fast enough.''
   Bruce Shriver, a computer expert at the University of Hawaii,
agreed that software tampering has much wider implications than just
computer hacking. With the massive growth in computer use by
companies, ``it's easy to understand that complete businesses _ both
national and multinational firms _ are potentially exposed to people
manipulating their data.''
   Ted Lewis, a computer science professor at Oregon State
University, said that ``certainly anyone with an undergraduate
degree in computer science could go in and mess up the programs of a
weapons delivery system or an accounting package, either one.''
   Boorman and Levitt wrote that the military threat of software
malfunction was illustrated during the 1982 Falklands war, when a
flaw surfaced in guidance software controlling the Sea Wolf missile
system used by British warships for air defense. It ``proved unable combat
situation that arose when two Argentine
aircraft attacked along closely parallel courses. Faced with the
dilemma of which aircraft to 
to cope with ashoot at first ... the software simply
shut down the defense system.''
   The problem was found to have resulted from ``a subtle error of
omission'' in writing the missile system software.
   Although that error was unintentional, Boorman said a serious
case of deliberate software sabotage was uncovered in the 1970s
affecting the computer system for a major U.S. Army supply depot at
Taegu, South Korea.
   A group of South Koreans and U.S. enlisted personnel manipulatoms of
nicotine withdrawal. Although the
theory's unproven, it is possible the body uses the extra sugar to
produce chemicals that help the brain get over the misery of doing
without cigarettes.
   One experiment at the Uniformed Services University showed that
people giving up cigarettes, when given a chance, will eat more
sweets than smokers. However, most of their evidence for sugar
craving is based on research with rats that are given continuous
doses of nicotine.
   _Rats getting nicotine gain weight more slowly than ordinary
rats; when the nicotine is stopped, their weight shoots up
dramatically.
   _Rats withdrawing from nicotine prefer more sweet-tasting foods;
sweetness is more important than calories. Rats withdrawing from
nicotine prefer sweet, low-calorie food to chow that is high-calorie
but bland.
   _Female rats put on more weight than male rats when nicotine is
stopped.

<HEAD>Saving The California Condor: $18.5 Million And Counting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What price survival of the species? In the case
of the California condor, it's $18.5 million over 13 years, with no
guarantee of success and bills that keep coming in.
   That pays for land; the salaries of those who have studied and
protected North America's largest land birds, captured them to save
them from extinction, and take care of them; and for
``condorminiums'' to help them feel at home.
   And don't forget $93 a day in chopped mice for 13 chicks hatched
from eggs retrieved from the wild and for Molloko, the first
California condor chick bred and born in captivity. Molloko was
hatched April 29 amid national fanfare.
   ``Over the long haul, we're going to have to spend even more,''
said Linda Blum, a National Audubon Society habitat specialist.
``But I think (should the condor vanish) the world would be a poorer
place.''
   The Audubon Society has spent about $1 million since 1975 on the
fight to save the condor. The Los Angeles Zoo has spent about $1
million while the San Diego Zoological Society, which oversees the
San Diego Zoo and the Wild Animal Park, has spent $1.4 million since
1979. Fifteen of the remaining condors are at the Wild Animal Park
and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the condor program's lead
agency, has spent $11 million since 1979; the U.S. Forest Service,
$570,00 since 1980; the Bureau of Land Management, $500,000 since
1978; and the California State Fish and Game Department, $3 million
since 1979.

<HEAD>State's Medical Records Valuable For Analyzing Drug Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rhode Island's unusually comprehensive
medical records dating back to 1970 will soon be available to help
drug companies find out what conditions or other drugs may affect
their products' use.
   The computerized records, detailing every birth, death,
diagnosis, hospital admission, hospital discharge and medical
complication of most of the stae's 980,500 residents, are
cross-coded by age, race, sex and other demographics.
   They will be sold to the pharmaceutical industry by Health Data
Resources, which is expected to be interested because ``the real
world is not at all like the pre-licensing test groups,'' according
to John W. Norton, HDR president.
   Pre-licensing tests required by the federal government usually
exclude pregnant women, the very young, old, and those with
underlying conditions such as heart disease for ethical and
practical reasons. That exclusion means that drug companies may not
learn for years their products' effects.
   Drugs being tested are usually ``given to only 1,000 or 2,000
people who have only one disease and who aren't taking other drugs.
It's given in only one dose and usually only for six months,''
Norton said.
   The companies will be able to study the results of only those
drugs that have been licensed and are being marketed nationwide.

<HEAD>Company Plans To Test First Portable Kidney-Stone Smasher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first portable lithotripter, a machine that
uses shock waves to pulverize kidney stones inside the body without
surgery, will be tested soon in the United States, its maker says.
   Most lithotripters now in widespread use are permanently
installed in hospitals. Other mobile units are installed in trucks,
and patients are wheeled inside for treatment.
   Technomed International of Danvers, Mass., says its lithotripter,
made in France, is the first small enough to be considered truly
portable. The one-ton machine can be rolled into a hospital by two
technicians, where it will be used to treat patients and then moved
to its next stop.
   ``We take the machine off the truck and treat people in the
hospital,'' said Sarah Sorrel, director of marketing.
   The first of the $1.1 million machines will probably be shared
later this summer by four or five hospitals in Washington state, she
said.
   The machine was introduced recently at an American Urological
Association meeting here.

<HEAD>Kids Can Be Hurt By Bug Spray Doses OK For Adults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With insect season in full swing, a
clinical pharmacist warns that children can suffer adverse reactions
from the amount of repellent that for adults just keeps the bugs off.
   Bug sprays containing high amounts of the chemical
diethyltoluamide can trigger reactions ranging from slurred speech,
a staggering walk and agitation to seizures and tremors, says Cary
E. Johnson of the University of Michigan.
   Doctors often don't immediately link those symptoms to insect
repellent because they also can be caused by infections, tumors,
Reye's Syndrome or other problems affecting the nervous system, says
Johnson.
   He and Deborah L. Edwards began studying the effects of bug spray
after helping to treat an 18-month-old girl who was admitted to C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital with symptoms of weakness and lack of
coordination. Her parents said they had been spraying her several
times a day to keep her from being bitten.
   Children should get smaller doses than adults because their skin
is more porous, and they are more likely to swallow the chemical
because they put their hands and fingers in their mouths, Johnson
reported in Clinical Pharmacy.

<HEAD>Milky Way Neighbor Seems To Contain Huge `Star Nurseries'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A galaxy next door to our Milky Way
apparently contains huge ``star nurseries,'' according to data from
an ultraviolet space telescope launched as part of the effort to
learn how the universe was formed.
   The $1 million telescope was pointed at Supernova 1987-A in the
large Magellanic Cloud for some four minutes during a 154-mile-high
suborbital flight from Woomera, Australia on March 13, and
identified large amounts of hydrogen.
   It is unusual to find molecular hydrogen in space except in cold,
dense gas clouds where they are shielded from destruction, said
Webster Cash, designer of the telescope _ a prototype for the Lyman
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscobic Explorer planned for an extensive
mission in the 1990s.
   These interstellar clouds serve as nurseries for new star
formation, which occurs when gravity pulls dense parts of the clouds
inward or when shock waves from exploding stars strike them, Cash
said. ``The large Magellanic Cloud evidently contains a number of
star-forming clouds.''
   The telescope launched in March is the first to observe the
ultraviolet signature of molecular hydrogen outside the Milky Way,
he said. It parachuted back to Earth and was recovered by NASA;
scientists have proposed another launch in February to gather more
information.
   Supernova 1987-A formed about 160,000 years ago from the
explosion of a star designated Sanduleak-69.202. Light from the
blast reached Earth only in February, 1987. It is closer to Earth
than any other supernova observed since one seen by German
astronomer Johannes Kepler in 1604.

<HEAD>Gum Disease Detector Uses Microscopic Iron Beads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A technique using microscopic magnetic
beads may one day be used to discover gum disease long before any
damage can be done.
   The University of Connecticut has applied for a patent on the
technique, in which iron beads are coated with a layer of an
antibody that seeks and binds to cachectin, a compound secreted by
bacteria in early phases of periodontal disease, says Dr. Edward F.
Rossomando, a dentist and biochemist.
   The beads, in solution, are applied between the tooth and gum
with a syringe. Only a small drop is required. After about five
minutes, the mixture is retrieved with an electromagnetic harvester
_ a fine-tipped probe that picks up the beads the way a magnet picks
up filings. The beads are photographed under a microscope and
analyzed by computer to measure the cachectin.
   ``Eventually, it may be used as a screening device in all
patients,'' Rossomando says. ``It also may be used as part of the
therapy, as a way to monitor treatment.''
   About 30 percent of adults will be diagnosed with gum disease
after age 35.

   From the first day out on the bank with a cane
pole and wiggly worms to those days of ``serious'' fishing with
artificial bait and dreams of a wallhanger, sunfish provide
unequalled sport.
   They also are delicious!
   They can be caught on almost any kind of tackle, ranging from a
stick and string with hook and worm, to the most delicately balanced
fly rod and hand-tied flies.
   The most common of the sunfish family is the bluegill, or bream,
which is found all across the country. Other species include the
redear, or shellcracker; the warmouth; the rock bass; the green
sunfish; the redbreast; and the longear sunfish or pumpkinseed.
   The bluegill, which has a distinctive blue ear behind the
gillcover, is native to the Mississippi River drainage area, but it
has been introduced into virtually every lake, river and pond from
coast to coast and as far north as it can survive the winter.
   While bragging size 'gills are usually considered to be anything
hand size or bigger, and heavier than three-quarters of a pound, a
few get to be real wall-hangers. The world record is 4 pounds, 12
ounces, caught in 1950 in Alabama's Ketona Lake.
   Light tackle is best for bluegills, whether it is on a pole or
rod.
   Cane poles or light spinning gear are fine bluegill tackle. The
great little fighter is super sport on a fly rod.
   The best time for bluegills is the spring and early summer, when
they are on the beds. Males guard the eggs in nests which look like
plates in the sand in shallow water. They will attack almost
anything thrown to them.
   There may not be a ``best'' bait for bluegills, but crickets,
nightcrawlers and red wiggler worms all are excellent.
   Many first-time anglers make the mistake of running the hook the
length of the worm, or hooking the worm so many times it hangs in a
glob. The advantage to live bait is that it moves.
   Hook a worm through the body one to three times, leaving plenty
of the ends free to wiggle and attract fish.
   It's not necessary to hide the point of the hook.
   Crickets can be kept for days, possibly weeks, in a wire cage
with a piece of potato or fruit, or some water-soaked bread to
provide moisture.
   To hook the cricket so it will both attract fish, yet be
difficult for small fish to remove without being hooked, insert the
hook into the cricket's soft tail, up through the body and just
barely through the throat.
   The bluegill usually will take the cricket head first, and the
hook with it.
   Use 2-to-8-pound test line with a snall hook, such as a No. 8,
tied on. Don't use a swivel. Put a small split shot 6 inches to a
foot above the hook and attach a small bobber to your line high high
enough above the bait to keep it about six inches off the bottom.
Adjust the bobber position to find the right depth.
   The key is a small bobber the fish can pull under.
   For fly fishermen, the adage ``match the hatch'' still holds
true. Small popping bugs also are excellent lures.
   Find a tree along the bank where insects are congregated and
falling into the water. There you will find hungry bluegills that
will hit almost anything.
   Bluegills usually get into gear when the water temperature rises
above 80 degrees. In reasonably clear water, you can see the beds.
To find the big bluegills, look in 6 to 15 feet of water a few yards
away. The nests usually can't be seen in the deeper water, but a
depth finder will find the fish.
   Try fishing around moss beds, underwater humps, near lilypads or
in standing timber. Big bluegills on their beds will hit small
spinnerbaits dressed with grubs.
   In the summer, fish around docks, fallen trees or in standing
timber. Bluegills also are found off steep banks and just off the
rocky shoulders of dams.
   To keep your fish fresh for excellent eating, lay them on a bed
of ice in your cooler. Cook them any way you like and the fun of
fishing will be followed by a gastronomic delight.

   Cleaning your fish is as easy as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
according to fishing experts at Mariner Outboards. You need a sharp
fillet knife and a fish dressing pliers.
   Follow these steps:
   1 _ Hold the fish upright on its belly or lay on its side and
slice the head off at an angle, behind the gill covers.
   2 _ Lay the fish on its side and use a fillet knife to cut along
both sides of the anal and dorsal fins.
   3 _ Use the fish dressing pliers to pull out the fins, grasping
them from the rear and pulling forward. This also should remove the
entrails. Use a finger to pull out any remaining entrails.
   4 _ Grasp the skin at the top corner of each side with the fish
dressing pliers and peal it off.
   5 _ Cut off the tail and cook to your taste.

   Joe has been born again.
   My long-time bait-castin' buddy was standing hip deep in the
little rapids, whipping bits of fur and feather under the willow
branches overhanging a quiet pool.
   He's become a fly fisherman.
   Fly fishing long has been considered an elite level of angling.
It's highly effective, not only for trout, but for bass and a whole
assortment of panfish.
   Heavy-duty rigs also have been devised for ocean fish that tip
the scale in three figures.
   One caution. Fly fishing is not for everyone. If you get past the
beginner stage, it becomes addictive. If you catch a really good
fish on a fly rod, you never want to catch one any other way again,
Joe warned me.
   Knowing that, if you want to get started in fly fishing, there
are two ways: go to a school or teach yourself. There also is an
assortment of books and videos to help.
   There are some simple tips to start in fly fishing.
   Unlike baitcasting or spinfishing, where the lure carries the
line, flyfishing uses the line to carry an almost weightless fly.
   The fly is attached to a nearly invisible tippet, which the fish
can't see. The rig allows the bit of fluff to settle gently on the
water, as if it fell off a branch just above the bank.
   The line, which can be either a sinking or floating line, does
most of the work, whipping back and forth in a delicate arc, carying
the fly to the fish.
   So buy a good line!
   An average rod can cast a good line, but the best of rods won't
cast a cheap line properly.
   Lines are measured by weight, based on the weight in grains for
the first 30 feet of line after the front taper. Weights range from
No. 2 to No. 13.
   Lines and rods should match each other to assure proper casting.
   Start with an 8-foot, 5- or 6-weight rod from a reputable maker.
You can get a good quality graphite rod for $50 or less. Fiberglass
rods cost about half that.
   The ultimate rod is hand-made of split bamboo, but don't worry
about one of those until you are good enough to really appreciate it.
   As you get started, a moderately priced reel is sufficient. Its
sole function early in the learning process is to store line not in
use.
   Read your books, study your videos and practice, practice,
practice.
   Remember, you're not whipping a team of horses. Learn the basic
movement of bringing the rod hand forward from the back cast before
you break your wrist in the power stroke.
   When you're ready to try your skill on fish, go to a tackle shop
that caters to fly fishermen for advice on flies. The adage in fly
fishing is ``match the hatch.'' Pick flies which resemble whatever
insects are flitting around and falling into the water, or hatching
from the bottom of the area you plan to fish.
   Finally, begin your fly fishing career where you have some room.
Flies tangle in branches just as easily as crankbaits hang up in
bushes. Pick a stream that's wadeable in hip boots.

   Professional anglers will tell you, sharp hooks
are critical to catching fish.
   There are several ways to sharpen hooks, but they basically are
variables on two themes _ a tapered point and a designed point. You
can go either way, but sharpen every hook one way or the other.
   There are mechanical sharpeners which will produce needle points
that are needle sharp.
   ``The needle is the natural shape in nature. If it weren't the
best way to puncture, animals wouldn't have evolved needle-shaped
incisor teeth,'' according to Doug Hannon, who recommends the Hook
Hone, a battery operated sharpener.
   It puts a needle-sharp point on any hook in seconds.
   John Juranitch, president of Razor Edge Systems, edge consultants
from Ely, Minn., recommends the designed hook, with three cutting
edges which cut into the bone of a fish's jaw. A three-sided point,
with a flat face on the stem side of the point, ``attacks any
surface it touches,'' he said.
   He recommends sharpening the three faces to create the three
sharp cutting edges.
   In addition, Juranitch said, it is critical that the point of the
hook face the direction of travel. The point should be in line with
the shank of the hook, not curved in toward it, or pointed to a side.

   Sherri Houston-Combs grew up in a bass boat and now, as a
professional angler, she is trying to outgrow the shadows of her
parents, two of the nation's top bass fishing pros.
   ``I'm just extremely proud of her,'' said her mother, Chris
Houston, six-time Bass'n Gal Angler of the Year and a member of the
National Fishing Hall of Fame.
   ``Chris is definitely a better fisherman than I am, and I'm not
so sure Sherri isn't too,'' said her father, Jimmy Houston, two-time
Bass Anglers Sportsman Society Angler of the Year and host of the
nationally syndicated ``Jimmy Houston Outdoor'' televsion show.
   Last year was the first time Chris and Sherri faced each other in
the Bass'n Gal Classic, the championship of women's bass fishing.
Chris finished fifth and Sherri 17th.
   ``We're competing against each other, but yet we're not. We're
always pulling for each other, helping each other out,'' Sherri
said. ``We spent one whole morning fishing around and around the
same hole. She was catching keepers. Mine, I had to throw back.''
   Sherri has finished ahead of her mother ``five, maybe six
times,'' in 3{ seasons on the Bass'n Gal trail, but the two never
have battled it out for one place in the standings.
   ``It seems we're far enough apart, either she's ahead, or I'm
ahead, that we can work together,'' Chris said. ``I don't think
we've ever fished one place in front of the other. We've always been
four or five places apart''
   That allows cooperation without confrontation, with the help
going to the one who has the best chance to finish high.
   ``We team up to help the leader,'' Chris said. ``We had one
tournament a few years back where she had just a slim chance to make
the Classic. I had one little bank where I had caught my fish. I let
her have that bank the next day, hoping she would catch something.
   ``We do stuff like that quite frequently. She shares with me and
I share with her. In practice, we can combine information. We can
cover a lot more water that way.''
   Sherri, 24, said she started fishing because ``I've grown up with
it. Dad started fishing professionally when I was 4 or 5 years old.''
   ``Mom and dad have not really pushed a lot on me. When I was a
kid, I'd take coloring books or comics or read or sleep or
whatever,'' while her parents fished. ``If I'd concentraced more on
fishing then, I might know a lot more now. I'm sure there's a lot of
newcomers to Bass'n Gal who know a lot more than I do.''
   ``I fished my first tournament a month after I turned 16. You
have to be 16 to fish Bass'n Gal,'' she said. In the following
years, fishing competed with college, marriage and, in 1986, son
Jeremy.
   She qualified for the Classic for the first time in 1987.
   She said she doesn't feel any resentment from other anglers on
the trail because of her family name.
   ``Most of them sort of treat me like another daughter. I've been
around Bass'n Gal from the very beginning,'' she said.
   A lot of the others team up in practice just the way she and her
mother do, so that's not a particular advantage, she said.
   The one advantage, she said, is the family name has helped her
accumulate sponsors, a vital part of professional fishing.
``Sometimes we work a package deal,'' Sherri said.

   Roland Martin danced a spinnerbait to the top of
the bass fishing world, but the professional angler said the key to
catching fish, and winning tournaments, is confidence in your
fishing pattern.
   ``You've got to believe in your patterns. Once you've set up your
patterns, water temperature, water clarity, that you're dealing
with, whatever the pH or sun condition might be, you have to believe
in the pattern and not deviate,'' he said. ``In a big lake, there's
maybe 100 pattern combinations.''
   Martin makes his living on Lake Okeechobee, the largest lake in
Florida.
   ``Once you catch a fish on a spinnerbait, you've got to examine
everything, because the next one will be in that exact set of
conditions,'' he said in an interview.
   Those conditions include everything from water condition to type
of cover, water depth and relationship to deep water.
   Martin said the key to fishing, particularly in the spring, is
water temperature. He used Lake Lanier, a big reservoir northeast of
Atlanta where he won a Bass Anglers Sportsman Society tournament in
March 1984, as an example.
   ``In bigger lakes, there can be a tremendous variance in water
temperature,'' he said. ``You can have up to 15 degree differences
from a warm, shallow, muddy cove to a deep clear cove by the dam.''
   ``The one tournament I won at Lanier was in March and it was
basically won in the warmest water I could find,'' Martin said.
   He won it by taking an opportunity, changing his place, not his
pattern.
   ``The easiest tip that I have in spinnerbait fishing is to be an
opportunist,'' Martin said. ``Take the best opportunity. Go for the
warmest water you can find. It is generally the best opportunity.''
   Look north for warm water.
   ``In this hemisphere, normally the high-pressure winds blow from
the south, good nice winds, and that normally pushes the warm water
up the northern creek fingers'' of a lake.
   ``The little creeks that run to the north are usually five to 10
degrees warmer than the creeks just across the cove with the
southern exposure because that water is being pushed out of there
and being replaced by the colder, deeper water,'' Martin said. ``In
just a quarter of a mile, you can find five or 10 degrees difference
in water temperature.''
   The pattern that won Martin his Lanier tournament was ``trees and
logs in fairly dingy water. When it got down to the last afternoon,
everywhere I wanted to go there was a boat. I had to make one
supreme gamble.''
   The gamble was to go to one of several spots that fit the pattern.
   ``I had seen three pockets I had never fished that had boat
docks, had stumps, had the right temperature of water because I'd
already checked them out,'' he said.
   ``I had 10 minutes left. I needed one more good fish, three or
four pounds,'' Martin said. ``I motored into a little pocket. There
was a log and an old Christmas tree laying there in the back of a
pocket by the boat dock in this little warm spot, about 65 degrees.
   ``I took the jig and I sailed it over there and the jig settled
about a foot and the water blew out and I hit the big old fish, and
he's towing this Christmas tree all over the cove.
   ``I had to pull the whole Christmas tree in. I reached down in
the water and grabbed him. He weighed 8 pounds, 5 ounces, and I won
the tournament by 6 pounds.''

   Camp, camp, camp, the boys and girls are marching.
   Lured by the out of doors _ or, out of the house, from a parent's
point of view _ youngsters this summer are marching off to camp,
computer camp and cowboy camp, camps that teach French cooking and
camps that teach horseback riding.
   Among the more unusual:
   The Orme School, a ranch-like prep school in central Arizona,
operates the Quarter Circle V Bar Ranch Camp, a Western riding camp
and summer school set in 4,000-foot-high desert terrain between
Phoenix and Flagstaff.
   In addition to teaching horsemanship on the 40,000-acre ranch,
the camp plans a summer trip on the Green River or Colorado River
and a 12-day motor caravan to study past and present Indian, Spanish
colonial and Anglo-American history and cultures in the Southwest,
including a stop at the Grand Canyon. The camp is for youngsters
aged 7 through 16.
   Camp Marchand is a rustic camp with a French accent, located in
the Dordogne River valley of southwest France.
   Youngsters learn French country cooking, go biking in the
countryside and take a three-day trip to Paris.
   ``Nothing amazes parents more than having their teen-ager return
from camp with his or her own cookbook _ and proudly make them a
full-course French country meal,'' says camp founder Rosie Tallman.

   While some of today's highest-powered bass boats
run at speeds above highway speed limits, most boats do more miles
on asphalt than on water _ so boat care begins with the trailer.
   Start getting your boat ready for summer by cleaning and
repacking trailer wheel bearings. It takes only a few minutes per
wheel. Be sure to check the wiring, lights and connector pin for
shorts and replace any burned out bulbs or broken lenses.
   Make sure wheel lugs are tight, tires properly inflated and
trailer brakes working properly if your trailer has brakes.
   Check the hitch on the tow vehicle. Make sure all nuts and bolts
are tight.
   Make sure the winch rope is not worn or rotted.
   Now it's the boat's turn.
   Start with the exterior. Rinse off dirt with a hose, then wash
with a soft cloth and soap. It's a good time to apply a sealer to
the hull. Fiberglass hulls will hold water if the surface is not
sealed.
   Inside the boat, start with the fuel system. Replace fuel lines
that are spongy or hard. If you have older rubber lines and are
using unleaded fuel containing alcohol it is a good idea to replace
lines with new ones.
   Clean or replace the filter. Look for hidden problems in the fuel
tank. Water can sink to the bottom and lead to rust in steel tanks.
   Clean out the tank, replace it if necessary, and fill with a new
fuel mixture.
   Check the motor cowl for missing or broken parts, then remove the
cowl and inspect the power head. Remove any debris and check for any
chewed or frayed wires or insulation.
   Now is the best time of the year to change spark plugs. Make sure
the new ones are properly gapped.
   Your owner's manual will tell you how to check the fluid level in
the gear housing. Check the entire lower unit for cracks or leaks.
Pull the prop and grease the prop shaft splines. File any minor
nicks off the prop.
   Make sure fluid drain holes and the speedometer pickup hole are
open. Replace the zinc trim tab if it is more than 50 percent
eroded. Touch up any scratches with primer and paint.
   Up front, check steering and control cables. Lubricate moving
parts on the control cables and any other moving parts. Inspect
wiring harnesses for wear.
   Take special care to inspect battery cables. Make sure the
battery is fully charged.
   If desired, you can hook up a flushing device and run the motor
at home. Make sure the water tell-tale is streaming from the engine.
Do not race the motor.
   Finally, make sure the winch cable is fastened, the tie downs
securely in place and the transom drain plug locked in position and
you are ready for summer water fun.

<DATELINE>HORSE CAVE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caves are among the last places in North
America where the explorer can boldly go where no man has gone
before.
   ``There are caves in nearly every state,'' said Bill Foster,
executive director of the American Cave Conservation Association of
Horse Cave, Ky. ``The last list I saw had about 40,000 caves. I
would say that's a considerably low estimate.''
   ``What we are hoping to do in Horse Cave is to establish a
national museum and education center. We are hoping to help raise a
few generations of people who understand that the importance of
understanding the land is more than just the surface. When you look
at the surface, all you see is a reflection of the rocks that
underly it.
   ``I would say there are 20,000 people, maybe more, that enjoy
cave exploring as a sport. It's one of the few sports in the country
where you can still discover the thrill of exploring unexplored
territory, the thrill of exploring something that lies beyond. There
are not many other options. You can go scuba diving, or to the moon,
but that's about it,'' Foster said.
   ``As a commercial attraction, there are something like 8 million
people a year that visit caves, including the national park caves,
Mammoth, Wind Cave, Carlsbad,'' and the commercial caves, such as
Fantastic, Onyx and Luray, Foster said.
   ``There are nearly 200 of these. Caves are one of the few natural
resources that people regularly pay money to go and look at.''
   The American Speleological Society (ACCA) was founded to help
protect those resources. Members are cavers who belong to local
clubs, or grottos, across the country.
   While caves can be spacious enough to hold large buildings inside
them, they also can be far too small for a human to worm through but
can run for miles, providing freeways through the rock for pollution.
   ``Cave protection is not just protecting a few pretty rock
formations. It's protecting groundwater resources,'' Foster said.
``People in karst areas of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee and
Kentucky may be drinking their own sewage because they don't know
how far and fast this stuff is moving.''
   Karst is soluble rock, slit with cracks, fissures and passages.
   ``Bacteria, industrial contaminents can move a long, long way
without being filtered out. It's the worst place you can possibily
put anything because it mainlines it directly into the groundwater
system.''
   ``We want to try,'' Foster said, ``to stop the consequences of
poor land use planning. We have very beautiful mineral formations,
archaeological sites, endangered species, a wealth of resources down
there that people think are insignificant because you don't see them
every day. They're `out of sight, out of mind.'''

   Sprawled across the South Snake Mountain Range in eastern Nevada,
Great Basin National Park is a large, remote place where the hiker
can find solitude in a place where the world's oldest living things
still survive.
   Located in a land that begins a mile above sea level and goes up,
it offers a little of everything found in the American West, from
Mexican high desert to Canadian tundra.
   Driving or hiking up the slopes of 13,063-foot Mount Wheeler, the
visitor can see the landscape change from desert shrublands to
juniper woodland, aspen forests and groves of bristlecone pines.
Atop the ridges is Artic-Alpine tundra and the southernmost glacier
in the United States.
   The road goes up to 10,000 feet. To make it to the Alpine tundra
regions requires wearing out a little shoe leather.
   Worn into the side of the ridge are a series of limestone caves,
with spectacular stalactites and stalagmites, fluted columns and
shields.
   Lehman Caves are open with a two-thirds mile paved trail winding
past the formations.
   Lexington Arch, a six-story wonder, is one of the country's few
limestone arches.
   The 77,109 acres provide mile after mile of back country, much of
it lightly visited.
   ``While the visitor center and the caves get very busy on holiday
weekends specially, I've been hiking in back country on busy
weekends and not seen another hiker in an entire day. There's good
opportunity to get away from it all here,'' said Al Hendricks, park
superintendent.
   The monarchs of the park are the bristlecone pines, tortured,
twisted trees, the world's oldest living things, which had been
anchored on those slopes 2,000 years ago when the Romans conquered
Egypt.
   ``We have bristlecones that are thousands of years old,''
Hendricks said. The oldest known specimen is in the White Mountain
area of California. That goes back an estimated 4,600 years. We may
have some that old or older; we haven't tested them all yet.''
   There's abundant wildlife in Great Basin. The most common large
animal is the mule deer. There are marmots out most of the summer,
and hawks, golden eagles and other birds.
   ``There are mountain lions and bobcats in the mountain range, but
they're pretty elusive,'' Hendricks said. ``You're much more likely
to see a mountain lion track. I've only seen a mountain lion once,
and I feel privileged to have seen that.''
   Great Basin also offers alpine lakes, most above the 10,000-foot
mark. Stella and Teresa lakes are within a mile or so of roads, but
some are a hard day's hike distant in the back country, ``five miles
or more and considerable elevation,'' Hendricks said.
   The trout in Baker and Johnson lakes offer the opportunity for a
fantastic shoreline breakfast or lunch, but the other lakes are so
shallow they freeze solid in the winter.
   There are four developed campgrounds with 92 sites. The Wheeler
Peak campground, at 10,000 feet, was opened this spring and about
one-third of the campsites were snow covered the weekend before
Memorial Day.
   Low temperatures hit the freezing mark that week.
   There's no water in any of the campgrounds. Plans call for water
to be available in two of them by the end of the summer.
   There is no electricity and no recreational vehicle hookups.
   Back country hikers don't need a permit to camp. But Hendricks
recommended that anyone out for an extended trip register with the
visitor's center.
   Part of the reason is that the park is easy to travel even off
its network of trails.
   ``You can do route-planning quite easily,'' Hendricks said.
``Most of the park is tree-covered, but not heavily forested. You
can follow a ridge or valley if you're good with a map.''

   The outlook for ducks is dismal.
   There is a real possibility there may be major cuts in the duck
season this fall.
   While the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is not making any
predictions about summer breeding success and fall hunting
regulations yet, conditions on the Canadian prairies are near
disastrous.
   ``I guess the real story is (the Canadian provinces of) Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba are drier than any of our field people
have ever seen them,'' said Rollin Sparrow, chief of the FWS Office
of Migratory Bird Management.
   He commented in a telephone interview after making a personal
tour of the Canadian prairies in late May.
   ``We have got to face the possibility it will be worse then '85
when some North American duck populations went lower than we'd ever
seen before,'' Sparrow said.
   Ducks must have water to breed and rear their young. Ever since
the last ice age, the prairie potholes of the Upper Midwest and the
Canadian prairie provinces have been the primary duck factories of
North America.
   As farming has become increasingly big business, more and more of
the potholes have been drained. The continent is in a drought cycle
that has run through most of the '80s, drying up still more potholes.
   The plows which had to stay out of the water, and the muddy land
around it, have chewed through the now dry weeds and brush.
   ``We have seen the situation deterioriating since last year,''
Sparrow said. ``After a good eight years of on-again, off-again
drought, and some slight improvements in populations in 1986 and
1987, it looks like breeding conditions have taken a turn for the
worse.''
   Last fall, ``farmers were telling us of dry conditions they
hadn't seen in their lifetimes,'' he said.
   Then came an extremely dry winter.
   Then came the spring surveys of the breeding grounds.
   ``It's already apparent, although we're not through the surveys,
we're finding a very dramatic deterioriation from last year,
although last year was well below normal,'' Sparrow said.
   ``There are quite a few transects that have virtually zeroed out,
no ducks to be seen in these spring surveys.''
   Ground crews double-checking aerial surveys confirmed the
results. ``One area that last year had 66 wetlands had seven. Last
year it had 145 ducks. This year it had 10. Generally the reports
from all across the prairie are of deterioriation of this
magnitude,'' Sparrow said.
   Many ducks apparently have continued on north, to some areas in
the extreme northern prairies that have some water.
   ``They're concentrated in abnormally large concentrations,''
Sparrow said. ``We don't know whether they're going to breed. We
just didn't find many mallards and very few pintails in the prairie
transects.''
   Mallards and pintails are the most common and most sought-after
duck species.
   Normally those species disperse across the prairies to breed.
When they are concentrated they either don't try to breed or the
survival rate for the young is very low.
   Either way, it means a very small number of ducks flying south to
the United States for the winter.
   Even though the focus is on the drought, Sparrow said, the real
story is the destruction of the breeding habitat.
   ``It's really astounding how much the natural wetlands have been
modified; first the borders around the ponds then, if the ponds stay
dry long enough, the farmers are able to plow through the whole
wetland basin,'' he said.
   Those wetlands don't recover in just one wet year.
   ``In one wet year, you just have a dish full of water, you don't
have habitat,'' Sparrow said. ``Ducks can't utilize a pond in the
middle of a plowed field, with no vegetation, no cover, no food.''
   Without cover, brush and weeds, nests are food on the table for
predators.
   It takes several wet years for a dry pothole to recover enough to
produce broods of ducks.

   This year is shaping up as a disaster for North American
waterfowl _ and may focus the country's attention on implementing
the North American Waterfowl Management Plan to protect and rebuild
the continent's duck populations.
   The plan is a $1.5 billion, 15-year program by the United States
and Canada, and a related agreement with Mexico, to restore duck
populations to the levels of the 1950s, when estimated fall
populations totaled about 100 million birds.
   With the possibly record drought on the Canadian prairies, this
year's estimated fall population could fall to near half of that.
   ``This is the most colossal recovery plan ever attempted,'' said
Harvey K. Nelson, who was selected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service as the plan's first American executive director. He said the
plan was the first opportunity wildlife managers have had to work on
a continental scale to save ducks.
   ``It is also probably the last opportunity,'' he said.
   James H. Patterson, head of the Migratory Bird Branch of the
Canadian Wildlife Service said, ``If we don't do anything, we will
just have to watch the populations decline, and the benefits
waterfowl provide to our societies will decline as well.''
   ``The plan represents a fantastic opportunity for pulling
together the somewhat desparate interests of the wildlife
conservation community,'' said Charles H. ``Chip'' Collins,
executive director of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the
group charged with helping fund the United States' $1 billion
portion of the plan.
   ``In order for the plan to be successful, elected officials are
going to need to be convinced by their constituents that the plan is
a priority. That's why it is important that people understand that
the plan has a tremendous amount to offer to other species, above
and beyond just waterfowl.''
   The plan is based on a single principle: To have wildlife, you
have to have habitat, places for animals to live, feed and breed.
   It calls for buying some land, protecting other land through
easements and improving the capacity of some land to produce
waterfowl.
   Although the drought had accelerated the decline in waterfowl,
the basic reason for the decline ``is the sometimes seemingly
inexorable pressures on our landscape, the land that has been
converted over time'' to other uses, including farms and shopping
centers, Collins said in an interview.
   ``Despite the good efforts of Ducks Unlimited and state wildlife
programs and others, they simply haven't been able to keep pace with
the pressures we've had on the landscape.''
   Canada and its provinces have taken first steps, pledging
millions of dollars to their shares of the plan. In the United
States, the first actual work is to be done this summer.
   A dozen states put up $1 million. Ducks Unlimited put up $1
million and Congress doubled the pot. Canada is adding $4 million.
   The money is to be spent in three critical areas, the Quill Lakes
region of Saskatchewan, in Alberta and in the Atlantic Flyway, where
the black duck, a long-time favorite of Eastern waterfowlers, is in
serious trouble, Collins said.
   While the overwhelming bulk of the program involves summer
breeding habitat in the Canadian prairies, as well as the Upper
Midwest of the United States, wintering habitat in the United States
also is important.
   Collins said six priority regions have been identified, prairie
habitat, the Central Valley of California, the lower Mississippi
Valley, the Gulf Coast, the Atlantic Coast from South Carolina to
Maine and the eastern Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway.
   Joint venture committees of wildlife experts from states,
conservation groups and both countries are working in each of those
areas, identifying areas that must be protected, and whether they
should be purchased or protected by some other means, such as an
easement.
   The committees are also looking at other, less expensive plans to
produce and protect wetland habitat.
   ``We're looking,'' Collins said, ``for a complete set of
strategies, a truly collaborative effort to get these things under
way.''

   A lot more people are cut with dull knives
than with sharp ones.
   That's because people tend to force dull knives through the
material they are cutting and that leads to slips and trips to a
hospital.
   John Juranitch, president of Razor Edge Systems Inc., Ely, Minn.,
has been studying cutting edges for years. To demonstrate his
techniques, he will sharpen his double-bladed ax and shave with it.
   To him, sharpening a knife is a two-step process _ tapering the
blade and then sharpening the edge.
   At an old table under a live oak tree, Juranitch taught an
impromptu course in knife sharpening, passing along expertise
learned from years of working with industry, including the meat
processing industry where razor-sharp knives are vital.
   Start with the abrasive, the stone, or hone.
   ``You are going to need an abrasive that will cut quickly to
remove all that unnecessary scrap iron'' on the edge of most knives,
he said. ``Use a truly coarse man-made stone, not a `coarse' natural
stone because the natural stone isn't coarse enough.
   ``Keep the greasy kid stuff off it, as it is just another old
wives tale,'' he said. ``If your stone is already oil logged, clean
it with hot water and detergent.''
   Hold your knife an angle just a few degrees of the coarse hone
and work it in a circular motion.
   Notice the grind marks where the hone is grinding on the blade.
``When these furrows reach the edge, they'll form a burr. When
you've got the burr, turn the knife over and repeat the process on
the other side,'' Juranitch said.
   The grind marks can be worked out with a natural ``coarse''
stone, but it's not necessary.
   That tapers the blade.
   Now the knife is ready to sharpen.
   The critical thing in sharpening the knife is precise angle.
   ``It doesn't matter what precise angle you use, although you
can't sharpen at 90 degrees and get an edge. But it must be
something like 25 degrees to get a decent cutting edge. Your better
edge will come with less pitch.
   ``It doesn't matter, just so the knife is held exactly at that
angle on each stroke,'' he said.
   Stroke the blade down the coarse hone, like you were slicing a
thin sliver off the stone, until you get a light burr. Turn to the
other side and repeat the process.
   ``Then go to the fine hone, stroke toward the cutting edge with
your edge approximately perpendicular to the line of stroke, then
you get an acceptable edge,'' Juranitch said.
   Keep working until the edge is as sharp as you want it. Then
refine the edge.
   Reset your knife a little deeper into the holder, increasing the
angle between knife and hone slightly, and make several more slicing
strokes down the fine hone on each side of the blade.
   ``If you want to increase the value of the edge more than that,
then you go to a very fine steel,'' Juranitch said.
   ``Using just the weight of the knife itself, run it down the
steel once on one side and once on the other with an angle just
slightly sharper than you had on the fine hone.
   ``Once you have this edge, you can skin out a deer or bear and if
you have a proper steel with you, and use it once in a while, your
edge should be as razor sharp at the end of the day as when you
started.''

   You don't have to go into the woods to enjoy
viewing wildlife. You can attract a wide variety of wildlife to your
yard with a little planning and planting.
   All animals need food, water and shelter. Trees are a good place
to start. Pick varieties that produce fruits, berries or nuts and
plant different varieties that produce those foods at different
times of the year.
   The U.S. Forest Service suggests the following varieties by
region:
   South _ live oak, black gum, American holly and flowering dogwood.
   Southwest _ pinyon pine, live oak, box elder and mesquite.
   West Coast _ dogwood, hawthorne, serviceberry, black oak, Douglas
fir and Ponderosa pine.
   Your local nursery, the Forest Service or your county
agricultural extension agent all can help select varieties for your
yard.
   Birds are either fruit and seed eaters or meat-eaters.
   Orioles, vireos, warblers, chickadees, nuthatches and woodpeckers
like mature trees with large insect populations. The robin needs a
lawn with plenty of worms.
   To encourage robins and other ground feeders, water your lawn
regularly. Many species of birds love to bathe in the spray and a
well-watered lawn helps provide a good supply of both worms and
insects. It also provides mud for robins and eaves swallows to build
nests.
   If possible, let one corner of the yard grow wild with weeds and
bushes. You also can pile brush or old Christmas trees in a back
corner to create cover for both birds and small mammals, including
rabbits and ground squirrels.
   If you have alders, birches, pines, oaks, dogwoods or other
seed-producing trees, you can bet you will have squirrels.
   Seed-eating birds and flower-seeking birds often need help to
survive in the city.
   Princessfeather, asters, rockpurslanes, blessed thistle,
California poppies, cosmos, marigold, sunflowers, tarweed,
forget-me-not, portucala, silene, zinnas and varieties of sorghum
grow large quantiites of seeds and won't become yard pests.
   Fruit-bearing trees and shrubs are popular with birds and
squirrels.
   More than 100 species of birds will throng to raspberry,
blackberry and elderberry bushes. Other popular species are juniper,
red cedar, bayberry, mulberry, pokeberry, strawberry, sumack,
grapevines and blueberry. They will bring woodpeckers, waxwings,
cardinals, bluebirds, orioles, warblers, robins, flickers and
finches.
   Hummingbirds are the best-known flower seekers.
   They are very fond of cultivated flowers, particularly those with
red, orange or purple petals. Varieties include daylilies, lilies,
canas, morning-glories, petunias, honeysuckles, jewelweed and
trumpetcreeper.
   In summer, the best way to bring birds and other animals is to
provide water. In dry weather, it can mean life or death.
   A bird bath a few inches deep with the bottom sloping gradually
upward toward the edge is one of the best bets. Make sure the bottom
and the edge are rough to provide good footing. Change the water
regularly.
   Make sure it is elevated because a bird bath on the ground can be
a happy hunting ground for the local feline population.
   In winter, food is a magnet.
   A feeder can be as simple as a Christmas tree, decorated with
popcorn or cranberries. It's best to offer several birdfeeders with
different delicacies in each.
   Place the feeders near trees or shrubs, particularly evergreens.
Many species will stay hungry rather than fly from cover to a bare
post in the middle of the yard.
   Different species prefer different foods. Cardinals and blue jays
like sunflower seeds. Goldfinches like thistles. Sparrows and
juncoes like cracked corn. All the insect eaters, such as
woodpeckers, nuthatches and chickadees, love suet, the waste fat
from beef.
   Avoid bagged, mixed bird seed. Many brands, particularly cheaper
ones, contain varieties songbirds don't eat. Often it is cheaper to
buy one large bag each of several varieties of seed and put each
seed in a different feeder.
   Keep an area under an eave or overhanging tree branch clear of
show and scatter seed for groundfeeders.

   American hunters and fishermen pay the majority of the cost of
wildlife conservation in the United States, according to recent
figures.
   This year, for example, a record $265 million in taxes paid by
hunters, fishermen and boaters will be made available to help
finance state fish and wildlife restoration programs.
   ``Once again, hunters and fishermen have made record
contributions to state fish and wildlife restoration efforts through
the federal excise taxes they pay on hunting and fishing eqipment,''
said Secretary of the Interior Don Hodel.
   Those restoration efforts provide and protect habitat _ for
nongame animals as well as the game animals sportsmen pursue. For
example, whooping cranes, the most endangered of the world's 15
species of cranes, winter on national wildlife refuges financed by
waterfowl huters.
   ``This investment by hunters, fishermen and supporting industries
results in many wildlife enhancement activities that will benefit
all Americans,'' said Frank Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
   The two major federal program are the Pittman-Robertson program,
which is financed by an 11 percent excise tax on sporting arms and
ammunition and certain archery equipment, and a 10 percent tax on
handguns.
   Fisheries and boating projects are financed by the
Dingell-Johnson, Wallop-Breaux programs, which place a 10 percent
tax on most fishing tackle and other taxes on other gear used to go
fishing.
   In addition the ``duck stamp'' which must be purchased by hunters
seeking migratory waterfowl, brings in millions of dollars each year
to finance the National Wildlife Refuge System.
   A study by the Wildlife Conservation Fund of America found
hunters, fishermen and trappers paid $1.1 million in license fees in
1986 _ or 53.4 percent of the revenue collected by state wildlife
and fisheries agencies. Federal payments to these agencies _ the
return of sportsmen's excise taxes _ contributed another 17.1
percent.
   ``Other revenue'' accounted for 13.4 percent of the wildife
agencies budgets. That included voluntary contributions by
individual sportsmen as well as the large sums raised by
conservation groups, such as Ducks Unlimited, the Foundation for
North American Wild Sheep, the National Wild Turkey Federation, the
Ruffed Grouse Society and scores of others.
   General fund revenue was 14.2 percent and the rest was interest
income.
   But, the study noted, sportsmen directly pay a percentage of the
general fund revenue as part of their hunting and fishing
activities. A large portion of state revenues is generated by the
sales tax and sportsmen pay sales tax on every rod, reel, boat,
rifle, shotgun and piece of outdoor gear they buy for hunting or
fishing.

   Hunters who wear glasses may need a little extra help from their
optometrist when it comes to keeping their vision on target.
   According to the American Optometric Association, regular
eyeglasses may do more harm than good for hunters because the
prescription may not be set high enough in the lens for sighting the
gun.
   Also, the association says, glasses with small lenses or thick
frames and wide temple pieces can hamper side vision, which is used
to detect motion.
   However, it adds, hunters who tell their optometrist about their
sport can get frames and lenses specially suited for hunting and may
also pick up a few tips that will not only help them see game better
against the brush, grass or sky but help them safely aim and hit
that game.
   For example, hunters are advised to consider yellow-tinted lenses
because dim sunlight reduces contrast between the game and its
surroundings due to the amount of blue light in the spectrum _ and
yellow lenses filter out blue light and increase contrast.
   Other suggestions include:
   _ Use a telescopic sight after 40. (With a regular gun sight,
hunters must focus from the back sight to the front sight to the
target in a fraction of a second. But hunters who are over 40 find
it increasingly difficult to focus on the back sight. The telescopic
sight helps by providing a close, clear look at the target.)
   _ Protect the eyes from powder burns, spent shell casings,
branches, flying shot and other debris by wearing safety goggles, or
use prescription safety eyeglasses, which can better withstand such
an impact.
   _ Wear hunter orange, because just as important as seeing is
being seen for safe hunting.

   A court has fined two organizers of a
fishing contest about $700 each for cruelty to animals, ruling that
fish feel pain when hooked and pulled from the water.
   The April 18 decision grew out of a suit filed by an animal
rights group against a local angling club that staged a fishing
contest two years ago.
   The object of the contest was to see which fisherman could catch
the most pounds of fish in two days. After the fish were pulled in
and weighed, they were returned to the water.
   Civil court Judge Horst Brinkmann based his decision on testimony
of experts called in to determine whether or not fish feel pain when
hooked, and if they suffered during the time they were out of the
water.
   Four wildlife experts testified that an increased heart rate and
labored breathing of the fish after they were pulled from the water
indicated that they feel pain.
   Brinkmann ruled that fishing was permissible if fish were quickly
killed, and if they were caught for useful purposes. But he added
that simply catching the fish to weigh and determine which angler
was more skilled subjected the creatures to unusually cruel
treatment.
   ``Fishing contests serve no further purpose than to determine who
has won,'' Brinkmann ruled.

   A travel group has predicted that Americans
will set new records in travel this summer, with the majority taking
a car, truck or camper to a vacation spot less than 250 miles from
home.
   The U.S. Travel Data Center, in its annual projection of summer
vacations, said the Southeast will remain the most popular
destination, while the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, which are in
the midst of an economic recovery, will generate the biggest
increase in vacation travelers.
   Cities, the data center said, will edge out oceans and beaches
this year as the preferred destination.
   Suzanne Cook, director of the data center, said the traditional
summer vacation _ ``where the parents take the kids on a three-week
summer vacation'' _ is no longer the model for many American
households, where more women work and have less time to take long
trips.
   ``We're finding that people are taking more shorter trips
throughout the year and not just one long summer vacation,'' Cook
said.
   It estimated that Americans will take 136 million vacation trips
during June, July and August, up 3 percent from the 132 million
trips last summer. Cook said the 1987 travel rate was a record.
   The travel data center, a private, non-profit group that promotes
travel, developed its forecast from the results of monthly telephone
interviews of 1,500 adults. Cook said the margin of error in the
survey is plus or minus 2 percentage points.
   The center found that nearly a third of those responding to its
survey _ 31 percent _ said they planned to visit a city, while 26
percent said they would go to an ocean or beach. That is exactly the
opposite of the results for the 1987 survey.

   The sliding dollar, a plentiful gas supply and the ``graying of
America'' all may be contributing a new look to the nation's travel
patterns, according to tourism officials.
   With travel abroad generally becoming more expensive, indications
are that many Americans plan driving trips in the United States for
their summer vacations, taking shorter but more frequent vacations.
   ``Today's predominantly dual-income families often have more
disposable income, but they have less time for extended travel
because of conflicting schedules,'' explains David Humphreys,
president of the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association.
   Large inventories of crude oil are expected to keep supplies high
and prices at or below last year's levels, according to the American
Automobile Association, which reports an increase in requests for
tour books and maps, indicating an expanding interest in domestic
destinations.
   Overnight visits to national parks _ 40 percent of which are by
RVs _ were up 7 percent in 1987, and officials predict overall
visits will continue to climb this year.
   ``Following two years of strong showings, the National Park
Service is again expecting increased visitations,'' notes tourism
director Priscilla Baker.
   ``We're anticipating more domestic travelers primarily because of
Americans' renewed appreciation of the outdoors as well as the high
cost of European travel.''
   Early reservations for RV rentals by foreign visitors to the
United States are reported up 100 percent over 1987 by Cruise
America, a Miami-based RV rental firm. At the same time, domestic
reservations are up 50 percent, says Bob Caldarone, the company's
marketing director.
   ``The obvious lure to European travelers is the weakened dollar
because it's making U.S. vacations especially affordable,'' he says.
``But efforts of travel and tourism organizations to make travelers
more aware of RV rental options are really paying off, too.''
   Some industry observers note the ``graying of America'' _ an
increase in the retiree population _ is helping boost RV sales
because older people have the greatest amount of time and
discretionary income to spend on such vehicles, and they enjoy
camping out.
   Humphreys, of the industry association, estimates that the RV
industry directly contributes $7 billion to $8 billion annually to
the U.S. economy through retail sales of new units, plus another
$6.5 billion generated through the used and rental markets and the
sales of parts, accessories and services.

   Americans lured by summertime's great outdoors are being
cautioned anew by dermatologists that the sunny side of the street _
or the mountain or the beach _ may not be the healthiest side to be
on.
   Physicians have long cautioned sun worshipers that too much
exposure to ultraviolet radiation can hasten the skin's aging and
wrinkling process, not to mention the possibility of skin cancer.
   Recent research indicates further depletion of the atmosphere's
protective ozone layer is letting through even more ultraviolet rays.
   ``The public is finally taking suncare protection very
seriously,'' says Dr. Frank Akin, senior director of clinical
research for Plough Inc., a Memphis-based manufacturer of suncare
products. ``Studies have shown one of every eight Americans develops
some form of skin cancer during his lifetime.''
   According to the American Cancer Society, 50 percent of those
reaching the age of 65 will develop at least one form of skin cancer.
   ``Older Americans have accumulated years of sun exposure,'' Akin
explains. ``Because many suffer from the worst type of skin damage,
our main concern at present is to halt the harm that has already
been done.
   ``As senior citizens enjoy their improving health in the pursuit
of sports and outdoor activities, they must take special care to
protect their skin from the sun _ be it while playing golf,
gardening, or even watching an outdoor baseball game.''
   Dermatologists recommend limiting the risks of overexposure by
using suncare products whenever spending time outdoors. Most
sunscreen lotions now use Sun Protection Factor (SPF) numbers
ranging from two to 30-plus.
   The SPF number indicates how many times longer a person can stay
in the sun before beginning to burn, when using the product, than
without any sunscreen at all. Sunscreens prevent damage because they
contain chemicals that absorb ultraviolet radiation.
   Generally, Akin says, an SPF 15 is recommended for protection of
most skin types, but during initial exposure to the summer sun it is
preferable to start with a higher SPF. After developing a base tan,
darker-skinned people may then move on to a lower SPF.
   ``However,'' he adds, ``there is need for greater protection in
certain cases. People with extra sensitive skin, people who live at
high altitudes, people who have had skin cancer and tourists
exposing their winter skin to tropical sunlight, all need greater
protection.''
   Other recommendations include:
   _ Limit sun exposure when the sun is at its strongest, between 11
a.m. and 3 p.m.
   _ Be extra careful near highly reflective surfaces, such as sand,
water or snow.
   _ Check with your physician before going in the sun if you are
taking medication; some don't mix with the sun.
   _ Examine your skin regularly, look for any irregularities,
differences in color or shading _ and if you notice any changes,
consult a physician immediately.

   Since summer's outdoor sports sometimes result in dislodged teeth
from swinging bats, tennis rackets and golf clubs, an oral surgeon
recommends having the family dentist construct a protective
mouthguard for active children.
   ``A mouthguard is an especially good idea for children who will
be regularly participating in active sports, such as those attending
a summer day or overnight camp,'' says Dr. Lawrence Zager of Chicago.
   If an injury should occur, he adds, the sooner the dentist can
treat the patient, the better the prognosis.
   ``Studies have shown that when a tooth is knocked out, 90 percent
of teeth replanted within 30 minutes have minimal root shrinkage,
thus increasing the chances of successful implantation,'' Zager
explains.
   ``However, the chances of successfully replanting a tooth are
greatly reduced when treatment is delayed more than two hours after
the injury.''
   A tooth that has been dislodged should be handled by the crown
only, he says, not by the thin membranes on the root, should not be
sterilized nor have the nerve or root end removed.
   And while making the trip to the hospital or dental office, it's
best to replace the tooth into the socket or store it in moist
gauze. Milk also can be used as a storage medium while in transit,
according to Zager.

   Many outdoor enthusiasts who participate in what are often
solitary sports have found a way around the solitude through the use
of a computer network.
   The Outdoor Forum on the CompuServe Information Service offers a
place where sportsmen using a personal computer and a modem can meet
to share their experiences, according to forum administrator Joe
Reynolds.
   Topics included in the forum, he says, include camping, outdoor
photography, scouting, fishing, hunting, cycling, birdwatching,
water sports, snow sports and recreational vehicles.

   Unemployment increased for the first time this
year to 5.6 percent in May, the Labor Department said. But both
government officials and private economists cautioned Friday the job
figures for last month are too unreliable to suggest that the
economy is losing steam.
   The 0.2 percentage point increase from April's 14-year-low
civilian jobless rate of 5.4 percent reflected a seasonally adjusted
shrinking of the U.S. labor force by 363,000 people, with 536,000
fewer Americans at work.

   The broadest measure of Japan's trade surplus shrank

from $8.15 billion surplus a year earlier and an $8.12 billion
surplus in March, the Finance Ministry said Friday.

<HEAD>Dollar and Gold Fall in Early European Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
early European trading today on West German opposition to a higher
dollar and a growing belief that a rise in U.S. interest rates is
improbable.
   Gold prices were also lower.
   Traders in Milan said declining fears of a rise in U.S. inflation
had made the prospect of an increase in U.S. interest rates less
likely.
   ``Much of the dollar's strength last week was based on the
expectation of the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates,'' said
one Milan trader.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German Bundesbank, said
Sunday in a radio interview the central bank had sold dollars last
week to show it wasn't interested in a higher dollar and a lower
mark.
   But another trader in Milan said sentiment remained strong for
the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.04 yen to a closing 126.07 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 126.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7184 West German marks, down from 1.7248; 1.4360
Swiss francs, down from 1.4363; 5.8160 French francs, down from
5.8293; 1.9298 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9355; 1,278.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,282.00; 1.2305 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2311.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8005, unchanged
from Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $464.40 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $464.10. Both were down from late Friday's bid
of $464.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $463.80, down from $465.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to $464.39 from Saturday's
$463.71.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $7.26 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $7.31.

<HEAD>Stocks Reach Record High, Dollar Dips In Active Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices climbed almost across the board in
active trading today, driving the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
barometer momentarily above the 28,000-mark for the first time. The
dollar declined slightly against the Japanese yen.
   After passing 28,000, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues then declined slightly, closing the day up 89.76 points, or
0.32 percent, for a record 27,996.24.
   When investors saw the Nikkei index top 28,000, said one trader,
they may have thought ``this is a good time to take profits.''
   However, traders said market sentiment remained bullish in heavy
trading. Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 1.6
billion shares.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 126.07
yen, down 0.04 yen from Friday's close. Spot volume totaled $5.67
billion.
   The dollar opened at 126.32 yen and ranged between 126.00 yen and
126.38 yen during the day.
   An official of the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there was little market-affecting news.

   A pocket-size compact disc player, a VCR you can
program by telephone and high-fidelity wireless stereo speakers are
catching the eyes and ears of buyers at the 22nd annual Summer
Consumer Electronics Show.
   Also among the tens of thousands of items on display at the
four-day event are a battery-operated videocassette recorder, a
visual telephone for the home and a video camera that corrects the
``jitters'' of home moviemakers.
   ``This is actually the marketplace for all consumer electronics
products,'' said Cynthia Saraniti, spokeswoman for the show's
organizer, the Electronic Industries Association, based in
Washington, D.C.
   ``This is where the retailers, the buyers ... see what is the
newest, the latest technological innovations and how they can market
these to the consumer for the next selling season,'' Ms. Saraniti
said Saturday, when the show attracted more than 93,000 visitors in
its opening hours.
   Many products shown are already on the $32-billion-a-year
American market, such high-quality wireless stereo speakers that can
receive an electrical signal from a transmitter via AC outlet
anywhere inside or outside the same building.
   Sony Corp. of America is showing off its D-88 Pocket Discman, the
world's smallest compact disc player, with dimensions of about
5-by-5-by-1{ inches and an ability to play either standard 5-inch
discs or new 3-inch discs.
   ``Sony has been working on the digital equivalent of the 45 (rpm
record) for some time,'' said David Kawakami, a spokesman for the
Japanese company's Park Ridge, N.J., office. The smaller discs,
which have a 20-minute playing time, are expected to sell for $5,
compared with about $15 for standard discs, he said. The Discman has
a suggested price of $369, he said.
   Among VCRs, Panasonic Co. is offering its PV-4826, which can be
programmed with a telephone call from any touchtone phone and
retails for $450 to $470. The VCR must be connected to the telephone
with a special jack and can be operated by punching a special code
on the telephone.
   Panasonic, a Japanese company with American headquarters in
Secaucus, N.J., also has developed a camcorder video camera that
corrects for the jiggling of amateur moviemakers and that sells for
$1,999.
   The ``electronic image stabilization system'' of the PV-460
camcorder ``eliminates 80 percent of the shake caused by nervous
hands,'' said spokesman Peter Schindo.
   Such stabilization has been available previously only on
camcorders costing tens of thousands of dollars, he said.
   Casio Inc.'s VF-3000 portable videocassette recorder with a
built-in miniature television screen and rechargeable battery pack
is a shoo-in for people who want to watch their beach-party movies
at the beach.
   The 5-pound unit, about the size of a large lunchbox, can operate
on its batteries for more than two hours and has a suggested retail
price of $1,399, said Steve Nosek, a spokesman for the Japanese
manufacturer's Dover, N.J.-based subsidiary.
   And for those who want to see whom they're talking to on the
telephone, there is the $399 Visitel, a device that can turn any
phone into a visual one, made by Mitsubishi Electric's Visual
Telecom Division, a Japanese manufacturer's subsidiary in Santa
Clara, Calif.
   The VisiTel, a roughly 8-inch cube, sends a still image in five
seconds to anyone with a similar unit, said spokesman Martin Brown.

<HEAD>Consultant Says Winning at Corporate Politics Is Just Playing The
Right Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIDGEFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winning at corporate politics is as easy
as playing a game, says Dean Meyer, owner of a management consulting
firm.
   And Meyer says he has just the game to teach the tricks.
   He has developed an innovative software product called GamePlan
to help managers and would-be managers learn how to play corporate
politics.
   ``Managers tend to view corporate politics as a black art,''
Meyer said in a recent interview. ``GamePlan constructs a science
around corporate politics and creates a framework for business
decision-making.''
   He said GamePlan, which is played on a personal computer,
simulates the political response of an organization to the actions
of a staff manager.
   ``Have you ever seen a project that seemed logical but failed
anyway?'' Meyer asked. ``Or another that seemed trivial, but turned
you into a hero?''
   He said his nine years of research demonstrates that the success
of most information systems executives correlates more with
corporate politics than with technical issues.
   GamePlan teaches the political dynamics of innovation by making
the player the manager of a hypothetical company. First the player
selects the corporate culture that matches his or her organization.
   As the player selects cards such as ``form a steering
committee,'' or ``publish a strategic plan,'' he wins or loses
credibility chips.
   Winning chips can get the player promoted, but losing chips can
get the player fired, Meyer said.
   ``How many chips you win depends on how useful you are to
others,'' Meyer said.
   GamePlan has been tested by more than 1,000 managers, Meyer said.
   ``We had one guy who put in his predecessor's history, who had
been fired, and he was fired in the game,'' Meyer said.
   Meyer, who formed N. Dean Meyer and Associates Inc. in 1982, said
the game does not get into nasty corporate politics.
   ``It doesn't predict if a guy is going to stab you in the back,''
he said. ``It asks you to look at your job as a manager of
innovation in an organization, not just technology.''
   Cmdr. Mark Adams, information resource manager of the U.S. Navy
Strategic Systems Program in Arlington, Va., said he has been using
GamePlan for a year.
   ``What we used GamePlan for was to sensitize our strategic
planning group as to whether a particular action would or wouldn't
work within the particular culture or industry we work with,'' Adams
said in a telphone interview.
   Does it work?
   ``It probably would have been a lot harder to do things we've
done without it,'' he said. ``It's hard to insure the long-term
success, but I feel comfortable enough with it to continue using
it.''
   Meyer said he and his associates will provide GamePlan to
organizations if they want to provide it to their employees. Meyer
will also organize workshops so the players can be debriefed on
their results.
   Meyer said he studied managers in more than 50 companies to
devise the software program. Meyer has worked with information tools
since 1968. He began his career at Stanford Research Institute. He
has also worked for Xerox Corp, and in 1978, he co-founded the
Diebold Automated Office Program.
   ``One of the interesting things it brings out is discussion if
you're working with your peers,'' Meyer said of the game. ``They
start to battle, and they get all of their political bias on the
table.
   ``Then they identify hurdles ... it's a way of team building and
learning something,'' he said.

   Stock prices were marginally higher Monday,
affected little by a half-point increase in the commercial banks'
base lending rate to 8.5 percent.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 2
points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,821.2 at midday.
   Volume was a slim 192.5 million shares at midday, compared with
359.6 million at the same time Friday.
   The equities market was little affected by the rate increase
because it had been expecting such a hike.
   The commercial banks, heeding a signal from the Bank of England,
raised their base lending rate effective immediately.
   It was the second increase in the benchmark rate in less than a
week.
   Last Thursday, the central bank signaled a rise in the base rate
to 8 percent from 7.5 percent after the pound dropped sharply on
foreign exchange markets. The base rate increase that followed was
effective Friday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. makers of semiconductors might ask the
Reagan administration for new sanctions against Japan following the
collapse of talks on foreign access to Japan's chip market,
according to a report published today.
   Chip makers said it is too early to determine what effect the
collapse will have. But Alan Wolff, a lawyer for the Semiconductor
Industry Association, said the group could demand an increase in the
existing $165 million in punitive tariffs if Japan does not import
more chips, the Wall Street Journal reported.
   Talks broke down Friday over a disagreement about how to measure
whether Japan has sufficiently opened its market to foreign-made
chips.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association says Japan should be
buying about 12.5 percent of its chips from the United States. The
actual proportion has declined slightly and is about 10 percent.
   Japanese negotiators say they will not promise a certain share of
the market in advance.
   ``We can't accept the premise that there should be increased
market share. Market share is a result of effort,'' Tohri Sato,
executive managing director of Hitachi Ltd. and co-chairman of the
Japanese delegation, said in a weekend news conference, the Journal
reported.

<TEXT>
   A consortium of creditor banks from Japan, the
United States and Europe soon will reach agreement with Brazil on a
new loan totaling $5.2 billion, Japanese banking officials said
Monday.
   ``The new loan package (to Brazil) is shaping up in concrete
terms'' in negotiations under way in New York between Brazil and the
Bankers' Advisers Committee, an organization representing Western
and Japanese creditor banks discussing ways to help solve Brazil's
debt problem, said a Bank of Tokyo official involved in the talks.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new
loan agreement will be ``officially agreed upon in the near future''
by the Brazilian government and committee representatives from 16
leading Western and Japanese banks.
   He declined to provide other details, but the Japanese national
newspaper Sankei Shimbun and Kyodo News Service reported the new
loan would be repayable in 12 years, including a five-year grace
period. The new loan would be used to help Brazil carry out economic
reforms, the news reports said.
   Brazil, the biggest debtor country in the Third World, has been
negotiating with a group of creditor banks, led by Citicorp of the
United States, since it announced in January its readiness to accept
an economic rehabilitation plan offered by the International
Monetary Fund.
   Brazil's current external debts are estimated at more than $109
billion, including about $60 billion owed to Western and Japanese
private banks.

   Tate & Lyle PLC said today it has signed an
agreement to sell off the food service subsidiary of Staley
Continental Inc. to Sysco Corp., a U.S. food distributor, for $700
million in cash.
   Tate & Lyle's $1.5 billion takeover of Staley is expected to be

   The London-based company had announced its plan to sell Staley's
food-service distribution and manufacturing subsidiary, CFS
Continental, when it launched its takeover bid for Staley on April 8.
   Tate & Lyle officials said today its agreement to sell CFS
Continental to the Houston-based Sysco is subject to normal closing
conditions.
   The $700 million in cash is to be paid on closing day, which is
expected in midsummer, Tate & Lyle said. The cash payment also will
be adjusted to reflect changes in CFS Continental's working capital
and fixed assets since April 30.
   On May 13, Tate & Lyle and Staley signed an agreement to merge
Staley with a wholly owned subisidary of Tate & Lyle. Both companies
are leading producers of sugar.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Relationship Between Terminal Use and Miscarriage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of 1,583 pregnant women in northern
California showed that almost twice as many miscarriages occurred
among those who worked at video display terminals more than 20 hours
a week in the first three months of pregnancy.
   The study, conducted by the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care
Program of Oakland, Calif., and described over the weekend in the
New York Times, said the findings did not necessarily mean VDTs
caused miscarriages. Working conditions and job-related stress were
among factors not measured in the study.
   Some experts have suggested low-level radiation from VDTs may
alter or disrupt cell development.
   The study called the figures on miscarriages statistically
significant.
   It also said pregnant VDT users were more likely to have children
with birth defects, but not in statistically significant numbers.
   Increased risk of miscarrying was found during both the first
three months and middle three months among woman who worked at VDTs
more than 20 hours a week, the study said. Women who worked at VDTs
less than 20 hours a week had no statistically significant greater
risk.
   The researchers reported their findings in the June issue of the
American Journal of Industrial Medicine and suggested more elaborate
studies were needed.

   The stock market turned downward today as traders
cashed in some of last week's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.84 to 2,060.46
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 452 up, 509 down and
448 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.11 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates rose slightly in the government bond market this
morning, reversing last week's sharp decline.
   Analysts said that provided stock traders with an incentive to
sell issues that bounced upward in the market's recent surprise
rally.
   In addition, they said, many investors continued to view the
upswing in share prices skeptically, questioning its prospective
staying power.
   There have been no noteworthy developments of late, the doubters
maintain, to erase the inflation worries and uncertainties about the
election outlook that had been depressing the market until last week.
   MacMillan Inc. climbed 2[ to 73|. The Robert M. Bass Group raised
its takeover bid for the company from $64 a share to $73 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.53 to 149.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .35 at 300.53.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 18.85 to
2,071.30, extending its gain for the week to 114.86 points.
   That surpassed the previous record weekly point gain of 108.26
set last Dec. 14-18.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 936 up, 536 down and 482 unchanged. Big Board volume came
to 189.60 million shares, against 193.54 million in the previous

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States continued to fluctuate, this week dropping by seven to
total 898, Baker Hughes Inc. reports.
   During the previous week, the rig count had increased by 13 to
total 905.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil. The
rig count totaled 757 a year ago.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma lost five rigs,
California lost four and Colorado's count was down by three. Texas,
Michigan and Wyoming each lost two rigs, while Ohio lost one.
   Kansas gained four rigs and Louisiana's count increased by three.
New Mexico, Pennsylvania and North Dakota each gained one rig.

the timber industry in the Pacific Northwest.
   The strike began at midnight Sunday at 18 mills in Oregon,
Washington and Montana, said Bill Hubbell, president of the
International Woodworkers of America-U.S.
   The strike by the IWA and the Western Council of Industrial
Workers affected 1,300 workers at 10 Willamette Industries Inc.
mills; 2,400 at six Champion International Corp. plants; and 800 at
two mills of DAW Forest Products Co.
   ``We are at a complete negotiating impasse with these companies,
and they refuse to even consider our initial industry settlement,''
said Mike Draper, executive officer with the Western Council.
   Draper referred to a tentative long-term agreement that his union
and the IWA reached last week with Bohemia Lumber Co. in Eugene,
affecting more than 800 workers. The agreement was the first
settlement in the 1988 bargaining year, and the unions planned to
use it as a foundation for future negotiations.
   Bill Latimer, Willamette Industries division manager, declined to
comment on the unions' strike plans Sunday, saying only, ``We'll
just wait and see what happens.''
   Attempts to reach officials at Champion headquarters in
Cincinnati and DAW in Oregon were unsuccessful late Sunday.
   Pickets first began appearing Sunday evening at Champion mills in
Missoula and Bonner, Mont., where 900 union members are employed.
   In Oregon, union negotations with Willamette Industries and DAW
stalled last week with no further talks scheduled.
   The IWA membership voted in April to let their leaders call a
strike if negotations broke down after the contract expired June 1.
   Top journeymen now are paid about $11.50 an hour, although the
average basic wage rate is as low as $9 an hour.
   The company offered a three-year contract with bonuses, according
to Willamette spokeswoman Cathy Baldwin, but unions rejected it.
   Draper said the Bohemia contract the unions have adopted as a
model in their talks restores and in some cases exceeds wages that
were cut in 1986.
   Details of the Bohemia pact will not be made public until after
the ratification vote this week. Sources close to the industry have
described it as a four-year agreement that gives wage increases of 5
percent the first year and 4 percent in each following year.
   Jim Bradbury, director of labor planning for Weyerhaeuser Co.,
based in Tacoma, Wash., said his company would reject provisions of
the Bohemia contract.
   ``We must be competitive with the low-cost independent producers
that are now our primary competition in Western Washington and
Oregon,'' Bradbury said. ``Increases in base pay rates are not
comptatible with this competition and cannot be recovered through
price increases.''
   Negotiations are continuing with Weyerhaeuser and and several
other companies, including Boise Cascade Corp., Simpson Timber Co.
and Pope & Talbot.

   The Teamsters Union has declared an impasse
with the Adolph Coors Co. and will hold an election at the brewery
here in a few weeks, the union's brewery chief said.
   Charles Klare, head of the Teamster's brewery division, said this
weekend the decision followed months of secret talks with Coors
during which the union tried unsuccessfully to get the brewer to
shrink its bargaining unit.
   Employees will vote on whether to be represented by the
Teamsters. In order to call for an election, the union must have
authorization cards signed by at least 30 percent of the workers.
   Klare said the union has had more than enough cards for some
time, but has not scheduled the vote because the size of the
bargaining group is undetermined.
   The unit's size is critical to the success of the vote because
many of the workers Coors may put into the unit never have been
unionized, and may reject joining a union.
   Coors considers the bargaining unit to be about 3,500 employees
who work in the brewery, two can plants, a bottle plant and a
corrugated cardboard plant.
   The union wants the unit to contain only the 1,500 brewery
workers, consistent with its bargaining units at other plants.
   The Teamsters wants to organize all Coors workers eventually, but
it does not want non-brewery employees included in its initial
contract.
   ``People who brew beer have one kind of job, and people who blow
glass have another,'' Klare said. ``The work weeks are different,
the problems are differnt, and there are diffent skills.''
   Coors, however, has considered its brewery and packaging workers
as one operating unit for nine years, officials said.
   ``They are together in terms of compensation, internal promotions
and other things, said John Meadows, Coors community relations
director.
   The unionization effort at Coors began in August after the
AFL-CIO ended its 10-year boycott in exchange for Coors agreeing not
to interfere with an organizing drive.
   The drive began as the Teamsters and the International
Association of Machinists competed for the right to represent Coors
workers. In March, the AFL-CIO gave the Teamsters the right to the
workers.

<TEXT>
   The tobacco industry formed an ``evil-minded
conspiracy'' in pursuit of profit to blind smokers to the dangers of
smoking, a lawyer said today in closing arguments in a cigarette
company liability trial.
   The industry ``callously and with no remorse sacrificed the lives
of its loyal customers,'' charged attorney Marc Z. Edell.
   Edell represents Antonio Cipollone, who blames three cigarette
companies for his wife's lung-cancer death. Rose Cipollone died in
1984 after smoking the companies' products for 40 years.
   In closing arguments last week, tobacco company lawyers focused
on Mrs. Cipollone, citing her own words, read from depositions taken
the year she died, and testimony by relatives. The industry lawyers
said she made an intelligent, independent choice to smoke and knew
the risks.
   But Edell today in his closing arguments reminded the jurors of
allegations he raised in the four-month trial that the companies
misled the public about the dangers of smoking through their
advertising, public relations and research.
   The industry formed an ``evil-minded conspiracy, intended for one
purpose and one purpose only: profits for the one part and deceit of
the public for the other,'' he said.
   Edell reviewed scientific research of the 1920s and 1930s that he
said should have alerted the industry to the potential dangers of
smoking.
   He also went through a sample of the confidential company
documents he introduced to support his charge that it was not until
the early 1950s, when a pioneering study linked tobacco to mouse
tumors, that the tobacco companies first started to consider the
question.
   And even then the companies did not tell what they knew, he
charged.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from Liggett Group Inc.,
Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Co., which made the cigarettes Mrs.
Cipollone used.
   Edell's closing statement originally had been scheduled for
Friday, but in a surprise move, he asked U.S. District Judge H. Lee
Sarokin for extra time to prepare. The judge gave him until today.
   Edell cited the difficulty of summarizing complex and technical
medical evidence about the nature of Mrs. Cipollone's cancer.
   The tobacco company lawyers objected to any delay, saying a gap
between the beginning of the jury's deliberations and their closing
statements would prejudice jurors against them.
   Sarokin, in what he called an ``extraordinary remedy,'' gave the
defendants' lawyers an extra 90 minutes in rebuttal time to
counteract the delay. But he granted Edell the final word _ an
additional half-hour to come before the judge charges the jury,
which was expected to be Tuesday.
   Edell has introduced numerous confidential documents gathered for
the first time in a tobacco liability case.
   The documents come from files of the defendants, their public
relations firms and advertising companies.
   He also called to the stand an addiction expert who said Mrs.
Cipollone was hooked on cigarettes, medical experts who said smoking
caused her cancer and marketing experts who said she was influenced
by advertising and public statements.

   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board today
announced a record $1.35 billion cash payout to shut down two
insolvent savings institutions in Costa Mesa, Calif.
   The bank board, which regulates 3,150 S&Ls, said it will begin on
Tuesday to pay off deposits up to the insurance limit of $100,000 in
the North America Savings and Loan Association and the American
Diversified Savings Bank.
   M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said it was the largest cash
payout ever for the agency.
   It is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. to American Diversified depositers and $209 million
to North America depositers.
   After recovering some of its costs by selling the institutions'
assets, the bank board expects ultimately to spend $931 million _
$798 million for American Diversified and $133 million for North
America.
   Depositers who had funds above the insurance limit will share in
the liquidation proceeds.
   Both institutions share the same headquarters and have been
insolvent for some time.
   Prior to the closing in Costa Mesa, the largest payout was $300
million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite,
Texas.
   However, bank board officials expect the cost of several previous
bailout packages eventually to be higher than the cost of closing
the two thrifts in Costa Mesa.
   Last month, the bank board said it was paying $2 billion in
assistance _ in the form of notes and guarantees, none of it in cash
_ to the Southwest Savings Association in Dallas to take over four
ailing institutions. In November, it announced a $1.3 billion
bailout of Vernon Savings and Loan in Dallas, $200 million of it in
cash. The rest of the assistance came in the form of notes.
   Wall said the bank board prefers to pay a healthier institution
to take over insolvent thrifts because it is cheaper for the
insurance fund. But in this case, he said the two S&Ls had little
value as going concerns because they lacked retail deposits and
branch offices. Instead, they relied on high-cost, short-term
deposits arranged through brokers.
   Wall hailed today's closings as the opening of a second front in
the board's drive to remove institutions that have been driving up
the cost of funds for all institutions. The first front is Texas,
Louisiana and Oklahoma, which have the largest concentration of
ailing thrifts.
   In order to attract money, North America had to offer an average
deposit rate of 8.53 percent, 1.45 percentage points above the
average for all thrift institutions. American Diversified was paying
8.64 percent, 1.56 percentage points higher than the average.
   ``So today we march forward in our drive to remove from the
marketplace those high-rate-paying insolvent thrifts,'' Wall said in
a statement.
   The bank board attributed the failure of North America, which was
chartered in 1983, to ``unsafe and unsound'' business practices. It
said the association grew rapidly by aggressively soliciting
high-cost jumbo certificates of deposit that were then invested in
high-risk real estate loan participations and time-sharing
investments.
   It had been in the bank board's management consignment program
since January 1987. A month after that, the insurance fund sued
Janet McKenzie, executive assistant to the chairman, for $40 million.
   As of March 31, North America had $98.2 miilion in assets and
$215.7 million in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $1.59
million a month.
   American Diversified, orginally chartered in 1980 as Tokay
Savings and Loan Association, had been in the management consignment
program since February 1986.
   FSLIC has filed suit against Ranhir Sahni, who in 1983 led the
association into what it called an ``explosive growth policy.'' It
is seeking $60 million, charging fraud, negligence and racketeering.
   As of March 31, American Diversified had $509 million in assets
and $1.12 billion in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $8.3
million a month.
   Depositers may present their claims either in person through June
24 or by mail. The bank board said depositors will receive the
necessary forms in the mail. Questions can be directed to FSLIC at
1-800-347-6660.
   More than 500 of the nation's federally insured savings
institutions are insolvent. The bank board says it is too soon to
tell if it has enough money to resolve the cases of all 500, but it
says it has enough to resolve the 200 worst cases.
   Last year Congress authorized the board to raise up to $10.8
billion by selling bonds over the next three years, providing the
agency with total revenue of about $20 billion.
   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigating
arm, estimates the cost of the cleanup at $26 billion to $36
billion. Some private analysts estimate the price tag at more than
$50 billion.

<TEXT>
   A giant West German utility company,
Rheinish-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerg AG, has agreed to buy
Texaco Inc.'s German subsidiary for more than $1 billion, an RWE
spokesman said Monday.
   RWE, West Germany's largest utility company, said it will pay
$1.23 billion to Texaco for its West German subsidiary Deutsche
Texaco AG.
   The purchase is conditional on the approval of the West German
Federal Cartel Office.
   RWE spokesman Friedhelm Gieske told reporters Monday that the
purchase agreement between RWE and Texaco's holding company, Texaco
International Financial Corp., was signed in Luxembourg earlier in
the day.
   He said he expected the Federal Cartel Office to approve the sale
and that RWE would take over by the end of the month.
   The sale, long expected, comes as the first major step in
Texaco's plan to shed $5 billion worth of assets as part of a
restructing plan following its emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
Court protection in April.
   RWE will include the Texaco subsidiary into a newly formed unit,
RWE Mineral Oil and Chemical Corp., Gieske said.
   RWE also said it is conducting talks with Norway's state oil
company Statoil to see if the Norwegian company would be interested
in taking a stake in the new RWE unit.
   Statoil could supply crude oil to the West German market and also
use its efficient refineries to supply that market with oil
products, RWE said.

   Britain's commercial banks, heeding a signal from
the Bank of England, raised their base lending rate Monday by half a
percentage point to 8.5 percent.
   It was the second increase in the benchmark rate in less than a
week, and represents an aggressive move by the government to boost
the sagging pound and counter inflationary pressures.
   Barclays Banks PLC, Midland Bank PLC, and Lloyds Bank PLC raised
their rate effective immediately. National Westminster Bank said it
would raise its rate effective Friday.
   The Bank of England signaled the increase by raising a key money
market intervention rate of its own to 8.5 percent.
   Last Thursday, the central bank signaled a rise in the base rate
to 8 percent from 7.5 percent after the pound dropped sharply on
foreign exchange markets. The increase was effective Friday.
   The foreign exchange market reacted calmly to the latest
increase, dealers said, because a rate hike was widely anticipated.
   ``It was going to happen sooner or later, and it happened
sooner,'' one dealer said.
   Sterling rose to a session high $1.8060 just after the central
bank's move, but settled back to $1.8035, slightly up from $1.8020
during the morning.
   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at 1 percentage point above
the prevailing base rate.

<HEAD>Sales Of Lead-Free Solder Rising As Deadline Approaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Makers of lead-free solder say their sales are
rising as the nation nears a June 19 deadline for mandatory use of
lead-free solder in homes under construction.
   Legislation passed by Congress in 1986 severely limited lead in
pipes, solder or flux used in drinking water systems of new homes.
It gave states a grace period of two years to change construction
codes to comply with the law.
   The legislation also prohibits the Housing and Urban Development
department and the Veterans Administration from backing loans for
newly built homes that have lead in the drinking-water systems.
   ``Sales have been great,'' said Thomas Bannos, product manager
for joining products at Engelhard Corp., which makes Silvabrite 100,
a lead-free solder that has half a percent silver.
   ``Especially in the last few months it has very dramatically
picked up,'' said Bob Rushmore, vice president of sales and
marketing for Atlanta-based Taracorp Inc., which also makes a
lead-free solder containing silver.
   Silver gives the solder a broader temperature range in which it
is ``mushy'' and easy to work with.
   Among the companies that make lead-free or virtually lead-free
solder are Engelhard, of Edison, N.J.; Taracorp, of Atlanta, which
sells Taramet Sterling; J.W. Harris Co. of Cincinnati, with
Stay-Safe Bridgit; Bow Solder Products Co. and M.C. Canfield and
Sons, sister companies that sell Water Pure Solder and Water Safe
Solder; and Oatey Co. of Cleveland, with Safe Flo Silver-Bearing
Solder.
   Many of the companies also sell lead-free flux, which is a
jelly-like substance that helps in the application of solder.
   The law bans solder or flux with more than 0.2 percent lead and
pipes and pipe fittings with more than 8 percent lead.
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates as many as 40
million Americans may be exposed to what it considers excessive
levels of lead in drinking water.
   Although lead has been used for centuries _ plumbing comes from
the Latin word for lead _ lead is a poison that in high enough
concentrations can cause kidney and brain damage. Children are most
at risk because their brains are still being formed.
   The EPA says drinking water accounts for about 10 to 20 percent
of the lead consumption by children. The majority comes from food,
dust and soil.
   The lead problem is greatest in homes built before 1930, which
often have lead pipes, and in homes less than 5 years old. In homes
more than 5 years old, any lead has usually become covered with a
coating of lime.
   Lead is soft and can usually be scratched by a key or
screwdriver. However, only an inspection can determine for sure if a
plumbing system contains lead.
   Lead concentrations are highest in water that has been sitting in
the pipes, so people concerned about lead should let the water run
for a moment when they turn on a faucet that has been off for a long
time.
   Also, hot water leaches more lead, so only cold water should be
used for cooking and preparing baby foods. Water softeners, which
also leach lead, should be hooked up only to hot water since the hot
water will not be used for drinking or food preparation.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Calif. Case Involving US Workers' Disputes With
Union</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether federal workers locked in a dispute with the union
representing them may sue in federal court.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that limits federal
employees in such instances to filing an unfair labor practices
charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
   Federal appeals courts have reached conflicting decisions on the
issue.
   In the case of Efthimios Karahalios, a Greek language instructor
at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled he could not sue in federal court.
   Karahalios had worked for the institute for nearly 20 years when
in 1976 he was promoted to the higher paying position of course
developer.
   Another Greek language instructor, Simon Kuntelos, filed a
grievance with the National Federation of Federal Employees, which
represents the institute's workers, over Karahalios' promotion.
   Karahalios was not a member of the union but it represented him
in collective bargaining. Kuntelos is a member of the union.
   The union decided to arbitrate Kuntelos' grievance but did not
tell Karahalios about it. After a hearing not attended by
Karahalios, an arbitrator cleared the way for Kuntelos, in effect,
to get Karahalios' job.
   Karahalios objected to his demotion but the union refused to
arbitrate on his behalf.
   Karahalios filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the
Federal Labor Relations Authority but the union and the agency
settled the case when the union agreed to state that it would not
undertake similar acts in the future.
   After objecting unsuccessfully to the settlement, Karahalios sued
the union in federal court.
   A federal trial judge ruled that the union had breached its duty
to give Karahalios fair representation. Although no damages were
awarded, the union was ordered to pay the legal fees that Karahalios
incurred in pursuing the lawsuit.
   The appeals court threw out the judge's ruling, stating that
Congress intended the Federal Labor Relations Authority to be the
sole forum for disputes between federal employees and their unions.
   The Reagan administration, citing conflicting rulings in lower
courts, urged the justices to grant Karahalios' appeal. But
government lawyers argued that the appeals court ruling was correct.
   The case is Karahalios vs. Defense Language Institute, 87-636.

<HEAD>Court to Study Fraud Damage Awards in Georgia Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an
appeal,stemming from a 19-year-old business merger, that could
affect the size of damage awards in some fraud cases.
   The court said it will review a ruling in a Georgia case that
limited the ability of purported fraud victims to sue an accounting
firm.
   The case arises out of the 1969 merger of Cavalier Bag Co. and
E.T. Barwick Industries Inc.
   The owners of Cavalier Bag _ Myles, Guy-Kenneth and Robert
Osterneck _ charged in a 1975 lawsuit that the financial health of
Barwick Industries had been overstated.
   The Osternecks sued Barwick officials and Ernst & Whinney, the
accounting firm that prepared the allegedly inflated financial
statements.
   After nearly a decade of pre-trial maneuvering, the case went to
trial in 1984 and the Barwick company and its officials were ordered
to pay the Osternecks more than $2.6 million in damages plus
$946,000 in interest.
   But the Osternecks lost their case against Ernst & Whinney.
   They then sought to appeal, seeking additional damages from the
accounting firm.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that their bid for
more damages must be treated as a motion to amend the original
judgment that the Osternecks had won.
   The appeals court, therefore, barred the Osternecks from pursuing
their related appeal to bring Ernst & Whinney back into the case.
   ``The rules of appellate procedure are designed to prevent
precisely what has occurred in this case _ the piecemeal appeal of
non-final substantive judgments rendered'' by federal judges, the
appeals court said.
   The case is Osterneck vs. Ernst & Whinney, 87-1201.

<TEXT>
   A giant West German utility company,
Rheinish-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk AG, has agreed to buy
Texaco Inc.'s German subsidiary for more than $1 billion, an RWE
spokesman said Monday.
   RWE, West Germany's largest utility company, said it will pay
$1.23 billion to Texaco for its West German subsidiary Deutsche
Texaco AG.
   The purchase is conditional on the approval of the West German
Federal Cartel Office.
   RWE spokesman Friedhelm Gieske told reporters Monday that the
purchase agreement between RWE and Texaco's holding company, Texaco
International Financial Corp., was signed in Luxembourg earlier in
the day.
   He said he expected the Federal Cartel Office to approve the sale
and that RWE would take over by the end of the month.
   The sale, long expected, comes as the first major step in
Texaco's plan to shed $5 billion worth of assets as part of a
restructing plan following its emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
Court protection in April.
   RWE will include the Texaco subsidiary into a newly formed unit,
RWE Mineral Oil and Chemical Corp., Gieske said.
   RWE also said it is conducting talks with Norway's state oil
company Statoil to see if the Norwegian company would be interested
in taking a stake in the new RWE unit.
   Statoil could supply crude oil to the West German market and also
use its efficient refineries to supply that market with oil
products, RWE said.

   Rich's department stores, a unit of Federated
Department Stores Inc., announced Monday it is laying off 250
employees as part of Campeau Corp.'s streamlining of Federated.
   Most of the employees being laid off are management and
supervisory personnel, Rich's announced.
   ``No salespeople are being reduced,'' the company said.
   Rich's, with 20 stores, currently employs about 9,000 workers.
About 80 percent of the firings will be in the central organization,
with 20 percent in the company's stores, located in Georgia, Alabama

   Rich's is the third store division of Federated to announce
employee cuts since the Toronto-based Campeau took control of the
chain in a $6.6 million buyout.
   Ohio-based Lazarus stores have dismissed 1,200 employees, and
another 320 have been laid off at Miami-based Burdine's.
   In addition, 92 of 530 employees at Federated's Cincinnati
headquarters were let go.
   No additional cutbacks were expected at the Atlanta-based Rich's,

   For more than a century, California has been
the promised land for those who heeded the age-old American advice
to ``go west.'' But now, the millions who have gone west are causing
many others to go to the polls.
   Across the state, and particularly in Southern California, voters
are being asked to put the brakes on growth, at least until the
roads, sewers and water supplies can catch up.
   In last November's local elections in California, 15 of 17 ballot
measures aimed at limiting growth won approval.
   On Tuesday, voters in Orange County, Seal Beach, San Clemente,
Manhattan Beach, Pasadena, Hemet and San Marcos are being asked to
adopt growth-related initiatives. In rapidly developing northern and
western Los Angeles County, Supervisor Mike Antonovich is being
challenged by candidates who say he has allowed developers to make
lives miserable.
   And more such challenges and slow-growth measures are in store
for November.
   ``What we have is an authentic grass-roots movement,'' said Bob
Buster, who co-wrote a successful 1979 Riverside growth initiative
and who supports a new Riverside County measure.
   ``We think it's time to fight back,'' he said.
   The movement started to gather steam in 1986, when Los Angeles
voters chose Proposition U as a means to slow growth by cutting
housing densities in some areas. Also that year, San Francisco
voters passed Measure M, slashing office construction in half for up
to 10 years.
   Worries about rapid growth are especially severe in Southern
California, where the 13.1 million residents of the six-county
region are expected to be joined by 5 million others by the year
2010, an amount equal to the population of Indiana.
   In Riverside County, the 4-year-old city of Moreno Valley, a
patchwork of housing tracts and shopping centers, is often cited as
an example of growth gone awry. In 10 years, its population has
tripled to near 90,000.
   Flood control in some areas consists of crude ditches and sand
bags. Many schools are surrounded by trailer classrooms, laid like
dominos to hold a student population that has more than doubled in
four years.
   The story is the same in school districts throughout the state _
wherever populations are expanding.
   ``We are being packed in like sardines,'' complains Gerald
Silver, 55, a San Fernando Valley no-growth activist.
   Studies have predicted that by 2010 the average Southern
California freeway commuter can expect to limp to work at 11 mph
unless roadways are improved.
   Already, pollution levels fail to meet federal clean air
regulations, and for the last two years drought-like conditions have
stirred concerns about future water supplies.
   ``It's like the lifeboat that says 65 (capacity),'' says Bill
Cunningham, a slow-growth advocate on the Redlands City Council.
``The 66th guy steps in. They all drown.''
   Critics say the growth-control measures will mean even higher
housing costs for California, where the average home price tops
$152,000.
   A study by the Center for Economic Research at Chapman College in
Orange found the Orange County slow-growth initiative would cost the
county nearly $270 million in lost sales tax by 1997, and in that
period, 100,000 jobs would vanish.
   The initiative, Measure A on Tuesday's ballot, would limit growth
outside city jurisdictions, depending on the impact that growth
would have on roads, emergency services, flood control and parklands.
   Identical measures are on the ballot in the Orange County cities
of San Clemente and Seal Beach. Proposition E in Manhattan Beach, in
Los Angeles County, would limit building heights and require voter
approval before residential areas can be rezoned for commercial
developments.
   Critics say the anti-growth sentiment is a sign of racism and
elitism, a product of the same thinking that spawns bumper stickers
reading ``California Native'' or ``Welcome To California, Now Go
Home.''
   ``The people involved in the movement are typically well
ensconsed and have their piece of the American dream,'' said John
Erskine, executive director of the Orange County Building Industry
Association.
   Pasadena's ``Responsible Growth Initiative,'' or Proposition G,
does less to stop growth and more to direct it. It asks that
developments of 25,000 square feet or 25 units be approved
unanimously by the city's directors for the next two years and
requires that developers pick up the tab for sewers and road
improvements and dedicate land or fees for parks.
   Measure C in the Riverside County farm town of Hemet also would
require developers rather than taxpayers to pay for growth, as would
Proposition R in the San Diego County city of San Marcos.

   The general partners are Metromedia Chairman John W. Kluge,

Perkowski, a 15-year veteran of PaineWebber, where he served as
director of the investment banking division.
   Subotnick and Kluge will contribute $100 million for initial
capitalization, but the parternship expects to raise another $900
million from limited partners.
   Metromedia is a privately held partnership with interests in

<HEAD>Lower Court Told to Review Ohio Takeover Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Monday ordered a lower
court to re-examine its 1986 ruling that an Ohio law regulating
corporate takeovers is unconstitutional.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled 2-1 that U.S. District Judge John Holschuh of Columbus should
review whether his 1986 ruling is still valid.
   Although the 6th Circuit court upheld Holschuh's ruling later
that year, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned it in 1987 and sent it
back to the 6th Circuit for reconsideration.
   Lawyers representing Ohio contend that Holschuh's decision still
leaves in question whether the state's takeover law is valid.
   On Monday, a majority of the 6th Circuit court's three-judge
panel decided Holschuh's court is the proper forum for the review.
In a minority dissent, appeals Judge Cornelia Kennedy said she would
have upheld Holschuh's ruling that Ohio's law, enacted in 1982,
illegally conflicts with provisions of the Williams Act, a federal
law governing tender offers.
   The Ohio law, known formally as the Ohio Control Share
Acquisition Act, forbids a suitor from acquiring more than 20
percent of a company's stock without the approval of its
shareholders.
   Holschuh's 1986 ruling came in a lawsuit brought by Fleet
Aerospace Corp., a Canadian aerospace company that used its
challenge of the Ohio law to successfully take over Aeronca Inc. of
Charlotte, N.C., a commercial and military subcontractor that
operates an aerospace division based in Middletown, Ohio.
   Aeronca initially fought the takeover but ultimately agreed to an
improved bid and now operates as a subsidiary of Fleet Aerospace.
   Lawyers for Fleet Aerospace now argue that the case is moot
because the takeover has been completed and is successful. But
lawyers for Ohio, which appealed Holschuh's ruling, want the case
kept alive. They argue that Ohio has a legitimate interest in seeing
that its laws are constitutional and that it be allowed to enforce
them.
   Ohio's lawyers say the law is a legitimate way of letting the
state regulate potential takeovers of Ohio corporations and also
protect Ohio shareholders who buy stock in out-of-state companies
that become takeover targets.

   A report by West Germany's central bank Monday surprised traders
by indicating the bank had quietly sold at least $2 billion in the
last week of May. Such a move lowered its huge dollar reserves and
helped slow the dollar's recent rise.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the Bundesbank, said over the
weekend that the central bank was not interested in a higher dollar
and a lower mark. A lower mark could increase West German inflation.
   After falling against the mark, the dollar lost ground against
other major currencies except the Canadian dollar.
   Keiichi Udagawa, chief currency trader of the Bank of Tokyo, said
he considered the dollar's decline a brief ``correction'' in an
upward trend, but said he joined in selling dollars Monday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.04 yen to a closing 126.07 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted higher at 126.22 yen. At the end of the trading day in
New York the dollar fell to 125.76 yen from 125.97 late Friday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8025 from late Friday's
$1.8005. Later in New York, sterling rose to $1.8006 from $1.7970
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7134 West German marks, down from 1.7266; 1.4279
Swiss francs, down from 1.4391; 1.2321 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2314; 5.8015 French francs, down from 5.8333; and 1,273.88 Italian
lire, down from 1,283.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7190 West German marks, down from 1.7248; 1.4357
Swiss francs, down from 1.4363; 5.8122 French francs, down from
5.8293; 1.9303 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9355; 1,277.65 Italian
lire, down from 1,282.00, and 1.2324 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2311.
   Traders said the Bank of England's increase in a key money market
intervention rate failed to support the pound because it had been
predicted and acted upon in advance.
   In Hong Kong, gold bullion rose to $464.39 a troy ounce from
Saturday's $463.71 an ounce.
   European gold trading was dull, as attention in metal markets
focused on silver. The late bid price in London for gold was $463.50
a troy ounce, down from late Friday's bid of $464.75.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $464.50, down from $465.50 late
Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $462.90 a troy ounce from $464.80 an ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London late Monday at a bid price of $7.34 a
troy ounce, up from Friday's $7.31. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $7.270 a troy ounce from $7.225.

   The hot, dry weather scorching the Midwest sent grain and soybean
futures prices surging Monday by the maximum amount permitted for a
single day on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans advanced by the daily limit of 30 cents a bushel for the
second consecutive session, bringing the July contract to $8.79, the
highest level in four years.
   All six major agricultural futures on the Board of Trade were up
the limit for the first time in a decade or more, the exchange said.
   On other markets, live cattle and pork futures moved sharply
higher, cotton was up the limit, coffee advanced and energy futures
declined.
   With the continuing lack of moisture in the Midwest, soybeans
have gained $1.11 a bushel in the past week.
   ``It's a ferocious weather market,'' said trader Victor
Lespinasse with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   And not much improvement is in sight. After the close of trading
Monday, the National Weather Service released its 6- to 10-day
forecast, predicting continued warm and dry conditions.
   Lespinasse said tens of thousands of buy orders languished at the
Board of Trade, with only few sellers surfacing. The expectations
were for sharp price advances again on Tuesday.
   Because of two consecutive sessions with limit gains, daily
trading limits are expanded on Tuesday to 45 cents a bushel for
beans, 15 cents a bushel for corn and oats and $15 a ton for meal.
   Wheat settled 20 cents higher with the contract for delivery in
July at $3.82} a bushel; corn was 10 cents higher with July at
$2.44{ a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher with July at $2.06{ a
bushel; and soybeans were 30 cents higher with July at $8.79 cents a
bushel.
   The sharp rise in grains and beans was felt in other markets, as
well. Live cattle and pork futures posted sharp gains at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, while most cotton contracts were up the limit
at the Cotton Exchange in New York.
   ``The limit up grain prices had a lot to do with supporting the
distant deliveries (of cattle),'' said Philip Stanley, an analyst
with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   He said the hot weather gave a direct boost to the nearby
contracts of cattle and hogs because of a reluctance to move the
animals to market in the heat.
   ``And there may be some liquidation of the (cattle) breeding herd
and of sows,'' he said. Higher grain prices mean more expensive feed
and lower profits.
   Live cattle were .57 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher with the
June contract at 73.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .80 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with August at 75.17 cents a pound; live
hogs were .50 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher with June at 52.95
cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .57 cent to 1.85 cents
higher with July at 56.12 cents a pound.
   Cotton futures prices rose the limit, continuing a trend of that
commodity following soybean prices, said Ernest Simon, cotton
specialist with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``It doesn't make any sense since we have absolutely no problem
with cotton. There's no (weather) stress; it's too early,'' he said.
   Cotton settled 1.96 to the limit 2 cents higher with July at
68.34 cents a pound.
   A light frost in Brazilian coffee growing regions sent futures
higher on the Coffee Exchange in New York.
   ``The uncertainty of how much damage was done, if any, kept
prices firm much of the day,'' said Sandra Kaul, an analyst in New
York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The buds on the 1989-90 crop are beginning to develop and a frost
can make them drop off, she said, adding however, that most buds
won't form until after mid-June.
   Coffee settled 1.32 cents to 2.57 cents higher with July at
137.47 cents a pound.
   Energy futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange, led
by sharp losses in gasoline and heating oil.
   Most of the weakness was due to technical market factors, said
Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc.
   Also, he said, there not much expectation that OPEC will
accomplish anything constructive at its ministerial meeting Saturday
in Vienna.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents to 39 cents
lower with July at $17.26 a barrel; heating oil was 1.03 cents to
1.29 cents lower with July at 45.84 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was 1.04 cents to 1.16 cents lower with July at 49.73 cents
a gallon.
   Precious metals futures were mixed on the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
   Gold settled $1.00 to $1.90 lower with the June contract at
$462.90 a troy ounce; and silver was 4.4 cents to 4.5 cents higher
with June at $7.27 a troy ounce.

   The nation's efficiency in churning out goods
and services improved more than four times more rapidly during the
first quarter of 1988 than it did in 1987, the government said
Monday.
   But average annualized hourly wage gains of only 3.4 percent
failed to put most workers ahead of inflation for the fifth quarter
in a row, the Labor Department said.
   Not since the spriraling inflation of 1979-81 have workers gone
that long without an improvement in their standard of living through
wage gains, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Productivity _ the biggest single indicator of U.S.
competitiveness _ increased among the nation's non-farm businesses
at an annual rate of 3.6 percent during January through March, the
Labor Department said in revised statistics for the quarter.
   Preliminary figures last month had put the improvement at only
0.9 percent, or roughly equal to the 0.8 gain for all of 1987. But
those earlier figures were issued before the gross national product
_ the broadest measure of economic growth _ was revised upward from
2.3 percent to 3.9 percent annually for the quarter.
   Output of goods and services among non-farm businesses, which are
responsible for three-fourths of the nation's economic activity,
grew at a much healthier 5.9 percent, the Labor Department said,
more than double the earlier growth estimate of 2.7 percent.
   To achieve the higher output, businesses increased their total
employee hours by only 2.2 percent, up from an earlier estimate of
1.7 percent.
   ``It's quite an impressive result but probably near the last of
the good news we're going to get on productivity,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., a New York economic
consulting firm. ``From here on it gets tougher as we approach full
employment and the last workers hired are the least productive.''
   The 3.4 percent average annual wage gain for the quarter sent the
labor costs associated with each good or service down by 0.2
percent, compared with a 2 percent increase in labor costs in 1987.
   However, non-labor costs _ profits, rent, capital and indirect
taxes _ associated with each unit of output rose 1.1 percent.
   After taking into account inflation as measured by the Consumer
Price Index, workers saw no increase in their buying power through
their pay raises, the government said.
   Not since the last quarter of 1986, when inflation for the year
was only 2 percent, have workers seen an increase in their real
wages. In 1987, their buying power actually declined by almost 1
percent.
   Only twice before since World War II _ once in 1979-80 and again
in 1980-81 _ have workers gone 15 months without an increase in
their standard of living, the Labor Department said.
   Factory workers fared better. Hourly wages in manufacturing
industries rose at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the first
quarter, the biggest increase since a 5.1 percent annualized boost
the last quarter of 1985.
   The higher wages, compared with a 3.9 percent increase in the
preliminary estimate and a 1.3 percent increase for all of 1987,
raised the labor costs associated with each item coming off the
nation's assembly lines by 1.7 percent annually instead of 1 percent
reported earlier.
   It also gave factory workers their first real wage gain _ 1.2
percent after inflation _ since 1985. In 1987, the real or
inflation-adjusted income of manufacturing workers fell by 2.2
percent.
   ``Wage costs are clearly accelerating and we're already running
into labor cost problems on the manufacturing side,'' said Sinai.
``Workers have tolerated a long erosion in real wages, partly
because of tax cuts and a willingness to work more hours to support
their consumption.
   ``But that string is running out,'' he said. ``The result will be
more inflation and a weakening of manufacturing profits.''
   Meanwhile, improvements in manufacturing productivity continued
on its 1987 pace of 2.8 percent annually through the first quarter.
   Manufacturing output, according to the revised figures, was 4.5
percent higher than the fourth quarter of 1987, with workers putting
in a total of only 1.6 percent more hours to achieve it.
   The higher factory wages, however, raised the labor costs
associated with each item coming off the nation's assembly lines by
1.7 percent annually instead of 1 percent reported earlier. Those
unit labor costs had fallen by 1.5 percent in 1987.

<HEAD>Joint Venture Would Combine Two Truck Leasing Outits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GE Capital and Penske Corp. announced
Monday they have reached an agreement in principle to form a joint
venture that would combine Penske's Hertz Penske truck-leasing unit
with GE Capital's Gelco truck-leasing business.
   The new joint venture will create a leading national full service
truck-leasing and rental company with more than 56,000 vehicles and
more than 400 service and maintenance facilities, the companies said
in a statement.
   The venture, to be owned jointly by Penske and GE Capital, will
have combind ssets of $1.5 billion and revenues of about $750
million, the companies said. It will employ 5,500 people.
   Roger S. Penske, chairman of Penske Corp., will be named chairman
and chief executive officer of the new company, and Brian Hard,
Hertz Penske executive vice president, will serve as president and
chief operating officer.
   Hertz Penske Truck Leasing Inc., which Penske formed in 1982 as a
joint venture with the Hertz Corp., is based in Reading, Pa.
   The company is a subsidiary of New Jersey-based Penske Corp., a
privately-held transportation service company. Penske will exercise
its option to purchase Hertz' interest in Hertz Penske prior to
entering into the joint venture with GE Capital.
   Gelco Truck Leasing, which was purchased by GE Capital in October
1987, along with other protions of Gelco Corp., provides
full-service truck leasing, rental and a variety of motor freight
transportation services to commerical clients nationwide.
   GE Capital, with net earning assets in excess of $36 billion, is
one of the nation's largest diversified financial services companies.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Steel Co. on Monday unveiled a $1.13 billion
modernization proposal that is contingent on the approval of tax
abatements in Cleveland and Cuyahoga Heights.
   The company, a subsidiary of Dallas-based LTV Corp., would invest
the money at its Cleveland Works, which employs more than 6,000
people, LTV Steel said in a news release. LTV Corp. is reorganizing
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   ``The Cleveland Works is the largest flat rolled steel complex in
North America and has a reputation for superior quality, but without
these investments in new technology and equipment, it will quickly
fall behind in the competitive race we are running with the top
steelmakers in the U.S., Japan, Korea and Europe,'' said David H.
Hoag, LTV Steel's president and chief executive officer.
   The proposed, seven-year modernization would include construction
of a facility to produce ultra-low carbon steels and the renovation
of coke and by-products operations, the company said. It also
includes the renovation of three blast furnaces and improvements to
the 84-inch rolling complex.
   LTV Steel said legislation would be introduced in Cleveland and
Cuyahoga Heights to secure abatements on tangible personal property
taxes. The legislation wouldn't apply to $442 million worth of
capital improvements, which are not eligible under enterprise zone
criteria and would produce $6.8 million in taxes a year, LTV said.

<HEAD>Brazilian Finance Ministry Announces End Of Debt Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Finance Ministry said Monday Brazil
had closed a $4 billion agreement for new loans with international
bankers in New York after lengthy negotiations on the country's $121
billion foreign debt.
   In New York, a spokesman for the 14-member bank committee said it
had a rule of not commenting on the negotiations and issued no
statement on the announcement by Brazilian Finance Minister Mailson
da Nobrega. But knowledgeable bank sources who requested anonymity
said that some pending issues remained unresolved and that
negotiations were continuing Monday with Brazilian representatives
in New York.
   Da Nobrega, at a news conference in Brasilia, said the new
agreement was not linked with an accord with the International
Monetary Fund.
   Brazil's two main debt negotiators cut off talks two weeks ago
over the issue of whether or not the IMF had to give the green light
before creditors would sign an agreement with Brazil.
   Da Nobrega said the committee of 14 banks in New York
representing Brazil's 700 creditors found the agreement acceptable.
   ``Together we are finding a solution to the debt,'' da Nobrega
said.
   Under the agreement, he said, Brazil will receive $4 billion in
new bank loans now, plus $600 million later in 1988 and another $600
million in 1989, for a total of $5.2 billion.
   He said the 1989 payment was subject to Brazil meeting the goals
set by the country's IMF-approved economic program. Da Nobrega said,
however, that this accord has not yet been signed because of legal
details.
   In February 1987 Brazil suspended its $1 billion monthly debt
payments, saying the country was broke. Inflation was running at a
1,000 percent annual rate, the trade surplus had tumbled from $1
billion to $1 million a month, and currency reserves had dipped
below $4 billion.
   In January of this year, Brazil resumed payments but said it
would only officially suspend the moratorium after an agreement with
creditors.
   A sticking point in negotiations between Brazil and creditors
since 1986 has been IMF approval of the country's economic programs.
Brazil argues that the IMF policies are recessionary and impinge
upon its national sovereignty.
   Since early this year, however, Brazil has eased its criticisms
of the IMF and agreed to monitoring by that institution. For
political reasons, Brazil does not want an IMF go-ahead linked to
new loans, political analysts have said.

<TEXT>
   The move by federal regulators Monday to shut
down two Orange County, Calif., savings and loans and pay a record
$1.35 billion to depositors renewed attention on the large number of
recent S&L failures in California.
   Since 1984 a total of 31 California S&Ls have come under
receivership or conservatorship by state or federal regulators,
according to the California Department of Savings and Loan.
   ``The laws are still there to make it legal to get in trouble,''
said state Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford. ``I
don't know how you insure against it.''
   Crawford, who has been urging reform of laws for the industry,
sees little progress in that direction.
   ``We're still waiting for some college professor to be
commissioned to make a study to tell us what to do,'' he said.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board acted against American
Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan, both
based in Costa Mesa, Calif.
   The action included a rare decision by the board to make straight
payments rather than arranging a takeover by another institution.
   A year ago, Crawford testified before a House subcommittee that
fraud was a factor in most of the state's S&L failures. Members of
the Consumer and Monetary Affairs subcommittee of the House
Committee on Government Operations held hearings because of the
extent of savings and loan failures in California.
   Crawford testified that deregulation of the industry during the
early 1980s precipitated extensive growth in sometimes risky lines
of business and at the same time removed much of the traditional
protection for depositors.
   Both Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan
were founded in 1983.
   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the two thrifts had had
few retail deposits, lacked branch offices, and relied on high-cost,
short-term deposits arranged through brokers, which they in turn
lent out for speculative real estate ventures and other risky
investments.
   The cases of the two institutions were similar to another Orange
County S&L, Consolidated Savings Bank of Irvine, which was founded
in 1984 and liquidated in 1986, three months after it was seized by
regulators.
   American Diversifed and North America Savings were two of six
Orange County savings and loans operating under the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation's ``management consignment'' program
as of last October.
   Crawford, the blunt-spoken S&L commissioner, offered a simple
explanation for the clustering in Orange County.
   ``There's a lot of affluent people in Orange County. Affluent
people get charters. Affluent people invest in real estate. Crooks
like to get close to money,'' he said.
   ``Where would you go? Would you go to South Central Los Angeles
to get people to invest in your project? You wouldn't. If you want
to get money you need to locate in Beverly Hills ... or Orange
County.''
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. is sending mailgrams
to the two S&Ls' depositors with forms and information they need to
claim their deposits.

<HEAD>Fed Okays Acquisition Of Firms Dealing In Government Securities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Monday approved
applications from two Japanese banks to acquire U.S. firms that are
primary dealers in government securities.
   The Fed is permitting Sanwa Bank Ltd. of Osaka, Japan, to
purchase Brophy, Gestal, Knight & Co. of New York, and Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, based in Tokyo, to buy Greenwich Capital
Markets Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.
   Sanwa, with assets of $324 billion, is the fifth-largest banking
organization in the world. Long-Term Credit, with about $185 billion
in assets, is the 21st-largest.
   When the Federal Reserve sells or buys government securities as a
means of tightening or loosening the nation's money supply, it does
so through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which deals
exclusively with about 40 firms which are designated as primary
dealers.
   Large institutional investors then buy and sell government
securities through the primary dealers.
   There are already Japanese-owned primary dealers, but the
approval of the latest applications comes as Congress is considering
legislation that would have the effect of barring the Fed from
designating Japanese-owned firms as primary dealers. It is a move
aimed at pressuring Japan into allowing U.S. firms greater access to
its markets.
   However, the Fed argued in its approval order that the Japanese
banks' entry into the market will increase the competition among
primary dealers, thus enhancing customer convenience and efficiency.
   One section of the trade bill, passed by Congress but vetoed by
President Reagan last month, prohibits the Fed from allowing
foreign-owned securities firms to serve as primary dealers unless
the foreign country grants corresponding privileges to U.S. firms.
   The trade bill would delay the effective date of the legislation
for one year in order to give foreign governments time to grant
access to U.S. firms before the foreign firms would lose that
privilege in the United States.
   In addition, primary dealers would be exempt from the new
restrictions if they were purchased by foreign interests prior to
July 31, 1987 or if they notified the Fed of an impending purchase
prior to that date.
   The Fed noted that both Sanwa and Long-Term have met that
deadline.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission announced Monday
that it is moving to require the merger of two major dry corn mills
to be rescinded.
   Illinois Cereal Mills Inc.'s acquisition of Lincoln Grain Co.
from Elders Grain Inc. could substantially reduce competition in the
production of dry corn products in the United States, the FTC said.
   The commission said it has directed its staff to seek a federal
court injunction blocking the move or requiring it to be rescinded.
The merger, which had been planned to be completed Tuesday, was
moved up to last Sunday, the commission noted.
   Dry corn mill products include flaking grits, used for corn
flakes; brewer's grits, used in beer, and corn meal, used in a
variety of foods.
   Illinois Cereal is based in Paris, Ill. Elders is a subsidiary of
Elders IXL Ltd., one of Australia's largest companies. Lincoln Grain
Co. is based in Atchison, Kan.

   The United Auto Workers union and
Chrysler Corp. made their new two-year labor pact official Monday,
signing the agreement covering 66,000 workers.
   Chrysler Motors Chairman Gerald Greenwald and UAW President Owen
Bieber traded lighthearted barbs during the signing ceremony. Top
negotiators and bargaining team members signed the settlement
agreements covering production, maintenance, parts, office,
technical and clerical workers.
   ``It's a good contract, one that we're extremely happy with, one
that provides some benefits and protection from a job security
standpoint,'' Bieber said. ``And I think the fact that we were able
to put it together early ought to speak well for future
negotiations.''
   Greenwald said, ``We had had a bit of a bumpy ride preceding
these national contract negotiations.''
   ``Nevertheless, between the union and Chrysler, we have been able
to achieve an early contract agreement which means that all of us
... are now able to concentrate on our equal goals of quality and
productivity without any concern of work interruption that would
have otherwise taken place under a September deadline,'' the auto
executive said.
   The contract has been in effect since May 16, when it replaced a
three-year agreement that would have expired Sept. 14.
   The new contract expires in September 1990, the same time as
agreements between the UAW and General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. GM and Ford reached agreements with the UAW last fall.
   The contract guarantees a set number of jobs at each Chrysler
plant, warehouse or office except in cases of cuts in production
volume brought on by slow sales.
   Workers received a $1,000 signing bonus and will have profit
sharing in future years. UAW Chrysler Vice President Mark Stepp said
one of the chief gains of the bargaining was Chrysler's unsolicited
promise to withhold executive bonuses in years when workers fail to
qualify for profit-sharing.
   ``We got a foot in the door with this agreement. ... The kind of
antagonism and the kind of ill feeling against excessive
compensation will fade in the future,'' Stepp said.
   The No. 3 automaker and the UAW began early negotiations April 18
as a way to cool rising tensions brought on by Chrysler's
consideration of a $2 billion offer for its 28,000-worker Acustar
Inc. parts subsidiary and the company's decision to close a
5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis.
   The tentative agreement was reached May 4 and eliminated the
possibility of a strike in September, which some felt was likely
because of the anger of rank-and-file workers over the proposed
Acustar sale and the Kenosha closing.
   Bieber said he was unconcerned by the relatively small margin by
which the contract was approved. He said the turmoil during
negotiations and the fact that 50 percent of the rank-and-file
failed to cast votes during the ratification process contributed to
the 54 percent approval.

<HEAD>Tate & Lyle Sells Off Staley Subsidiary</HEAD>

   Tate & Lyle PLC announced Monday it has
signed an agreement to sell off the food-service subsidiary of
Staley Continental Inc. to Sysco Corp., a Texas-based food
distributor, for $700 million in cash.
   The takeover of Staley by the London-based Tate & Lyle also was
completed Monday.
   The British company had announced its plan to sell Staley's
food-service distribution and manufacturing subsidiary, CFS
Continental, when it launched its takeover of Staley on April 8.
   Tate & Lyle officials said Monday its agreement to sell CFS
Continental to the Houston-based Sysco is subject to normal closing
conditions.
   The $700 million in cash is to be paid on closing day, which is
expected in midsummer, Tate & Lyle said. The cash payment also will
be adjusted to reflect changes in CFS Continental's working capital
and fixed assets since April 30.
   ``We are very pleased to have reached an agreement so quickly for
the sale of CFS Continental as a unit and to a company that will be
able to take advantage of its potential,'' said Neil M. Shaw,
chairman and chief executive of Tate & Lyle.
   ``With this behind us, we are eager to move forward with
returning Staley's headquarters to Decatur and to proceed with
running Staley's corn refining business, thereby building on the
company's strengths in the U.S. sweetener industry,'' Shaw said in a
statement.
   On May 13, Tate & Lyle and Staley signed an agreement to merge
Staley with RP Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subisidary of Tate
& Lyle.
   Sysco is a leading distributor of food and related products to
the food service industry, serving restuarants, educational
institutions, nursing homes and hotel and motel chains.
   It also distributes frozen foods to supermarkets in several major
metropolitian areas, and has about 83 distribution facilities and
cash and carry outlets in 30 states.
   In 1987, Sysco reported a profit of $61.8 million on sales of
$3.66 billion.

<HEAD>Coniston Says Gillette Misled Stockholders About Potential Suitors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gillette Co. had discussions with at least two
potential suitors this year and one in 1987, even though it told
stockholders during a proxy fight that no one was interested in
buying the company, a New York-based investment firm charged in
court documents made public Monday.
   Coniston Group, which has been involved in a long and bitter
battle to gain control of Gillette, also accused the personal care
giant of paying greenmail to avoid a hostile 1986 takeover bid by
Revlon Group Inc.
   Gillette admitted in court documents that it held discussions
with one company in September 1987 and others this year but denied
they involved talk of a possible takeover.
   The allegations were made in a countersuit filed by Coniston in
federal court in April charging Gillette with misrepresenting facts
in legal action and in material sent to stockholders before a proxy
vote that month.
   Gillette sued Coniston for allegedly failing to disclose all its
financial backers before the proxy vote in April, in which
shareholders rejected Coniston's attempt to gain control of
one-third of Gillette's board of directors.
   U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel placed the countersuit and other
documents under seal but made them public Monday after she reviewed
them. The trial in the lawsuits is scheduled to start next Monday.
   In its countersuit, Coniston charges that Gillette:
   _Signed confidentiality agreements in November 1986 with nine
potential ``white knights'' interested in buying the company. In the
agreements, Gillette gave the companies access to confidential
information in exchange for a promise not to buy Gillette securities
without company approval for two years.
   _Paid greenmail when it bought Revlon's more than 9 million
shares of Gillette stock in November 1986 at $59.50 a share, or
$3.125 a share above market price, to avoid a hostile takeover.
   _Paid $9 million to Revlon's investment banker, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., in exchange for a promise not to arrange or provide
financing for purchase of Gillette securities for three years.
   _Hired a private investigator to research Coniston members
dealings around the world.
   _Presented to stockholders misleadingly favorable earnings
projections.
   In its 31-page point-by-point response, Gillette charges that
Coniston's claim is ``repetitive and irrelevant'' and ``a tool in
the Coniston Group's public relations campaign against Gillette.''
   Gillette called the agreements with the nine companies ``standard
procedure,'' denied they were suitors, denied paying greenmail to
Revlon and charged that Coniston painted the dealings ``in a
blatantly false and miseleading manner in attempt to mislead
stockholders.''
   Coniston ``mischaracterizes totally the nature of the
communications,'' Gillette spokesman David Fausch said. ``Gillette
was approached by certain parties who were merely inquiring whether
the company had any interest in discussing certain types of
transactions.
   ``The interests were not attractive to Gillette ... and the
inquiries were not sufficiently concrete or detailed to warrant
action,'' he said.
   At its April 21 annual meeting, Gillette shareholders rejected by
52 percent to 48 percent Coniston's slate of four candidates for the
12-member Gillette board.
   Coniston, which controls about 5.8 percent of Gillette shares,
launched a proxy battle in February and pledged to convince the
other eight directors to sell Boston-based Gillette if its
candidates were elected.
   The countersuit, filed by two Coniston subsidiaries, RB
Associates of New Jersey and Bahamas-based RB Partners, seeks
dismissal of Gillette's suit and ``some equitable relief.'' Zobel is
to consider the countersuit first.

<HEAD>Walkout in Northwest Over Restoration of Lost Wages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. CRUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 4,500 union workers walked off their
jobs Monday at lumber mills and plywood plants in the Pacific
Northwest in a showdown over efforts to restore wages and benefits
lost two years ago.
   The strike shut down 18 wood products operations in Oregon,
Washington and Montana. Willamette Industries Inc. of Portland,
Champion International Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and DAW Forest
Products Co. of Lake Oswego were affected by the walkout.
   The surprise walkout followed the collapse last week of talks
between the three companies and two unions _ the International
Woodworkers of America-U.S. and the Western Council of Industrial
Workers, both based in Portland.
   The unions have vowed to win restoration of wages and benefits
lost in 1986 after a series of unsuccessful strikes.
   The first step toward restoration was taken last week when the
unions announced a tentative agreement with Bohemia Inc. of Eugene.
Union officials said the four-year pact largely restored wages lost
two years ago.
   The unions want to use the Bohemia agreement as an industry
standard, but other companies so far have rejected it.
   Dennis Elder, a spokesman for Champion in Milltown, Mont., said
his company did not think the Bohemia agreement ``represents a
standard for the wood products industry.''
   Talks broke down Friday after Champion made a counter-proposal,
but Elder said the company was ready to go back to the bargaining
table.
   ``This is a strike that did not have to happen,'' he said.
   Talks with Willamette also broke down after the company's
counter-proposal was rejected, said spokeswoman Cathy Baldwin.
   ``We've expressed a willingness to meet any time they're willing
to meet and bargain and compromise,'' she said.
   The two unions represent about 1,300 workers at five lumber
mills, four plywood mills, two wood products plants, a machine shop
and a logging shop operated by Willamette in Lebanon, Sweet Home,
Dallas and Albany, Ore.
   The IWA bargains for 450 workers at Champion's Roseburg, Ore.,
plywood plant. The WCIW represents about 200 Champion workers at a
Klickitat, Wash., sawmill, and 1,800 Champion workers at sawmills
and plywood plants at Missoula, Bonner and Libby, Mont.
   Contracts at Klickitat and Libby expire later this summer, but
workers stayed out Monday, honoring picket lines set up by workers
from other mills.
   Members of both unions voted overwhelmingly a month ago to
authorize their negotiators to call strikes if necessary.
   Elder and Baldwin said their companies had no immediate plans to
reopen their operations.
   Baldwin said Willamette's three-year offer included bonuses the
first two years and a 3.5 percent wage increase the third year.
   The average plywood worker, making $9.77 per hour, would gross an
additional $2,777 over the life of the contract, she said.
   Elder declined to discuss Champion's last offer.
   Union leaders oppose bonuses because the base wage rate remains
the same, although annual wages are boosted.
