<HEAD>Bush Against AIDS Discrimination, Dukakis for Housing</HEAD>

   Republican George Bush on Tuesday called for a federal law
banning discrimination against AIDS sufferers ``to lay to rest some
fears.'' Democrat Michael Dukakis endorsed spending $3 billion on
new housing programs.
   Meanwhile, GOP sources said New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean had been
tapped as the keynote speaker for the Republican convention in New
Orleans in August. Word filtered out the day after the Democrats
announced that Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards would give the
opening speech at their convention.
   Dukakis, just three weeks away from the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, suggested there was no point in paying
attention to public speculation about who might be on his list for
the vice presidential nomination.
   ``There's only one guy who knows what's going on and that's the
guy you're looking at,'' the Massachusetts governor told reporters
in Boston.
   Jesse Jackson, who is still contesting the Democratic
presidential nomination as well as saying he deserves consideration
for the No. 2 spot, faced a snarled schedule as plane troubles
forced cancellation of a Texas speech.
   Vice President Bush, campaigning in California's Silicon Valley,
came out strongly in favor of the report of President Reagan's
commission on AIDS, calling it ``a landmark analysis.''
   Bush, the certain GOP nominee, praised the report for
recognizing ``the need for patient notification and widespread
testing as a means to limit the spread of AIDS. Such programs would
be ineffective without being coupled with strict confidentiality
and anti-discrimination provisions.''
   On Air Force Two on the way to California from Washington, Bush
said that means he supports a federal law barring discrimination
against AIDS sufferers, a key provision of the report on which
Reagan has yet to take a position.
   ``I think it is needed,'' Bush said. ``I think it is important
to do a lot to lay to rest some of the fears. There is a lot of
misunderstanding.
   ``I would hate if a kid of mine got a blood transfusion, (if) my
grandson had AIDS, and the community discriminated against that
child, innocent child, particularly when the report concludes ...
AIDS is not _ can't be transmitted in ways that some had feared,''
Bush said.
   Dukakis responded to the report last week, saying in a statement
issued Friday, ``we join ... the commission in its call for tougher
anti-discrimination and confidentiality measures. We support their
call for expanded education and research programs and innovative
approaches to providing care.''
   In his response, Dukakis urged Reagan to act on the commission's
recommendations before leaving office.
   ``We must come together in this time of crisis and demonstrate
the true American character of compassion and caring for our fellow
human beings living with AIDS,'' Dukakis said in the statement.
   Dukakis tried to keep the focus on issues Tuesday, speaking to a
housing forum in Boston and then touring a site where more than a
dozen homes have been sold to low- and moderate-income people
through a state program offering subsidized mortgages.
   ``I don't see how we can talk about a bright economic future for
America if it doesn't include decent and affordable housing for all
our citizens,'' Dukakis said in a speech to the housing forum.
   He promised, if elected, to provide $3 billion to carry out a
program that would be established under legislation sponsored by
Sen. Alan Cranston of California. Cranston joined Dukakis for the
event.
   Dukakis blamed what he said was a lack of affordable housing on
a 90 percent cut in federal spending on housing by the Reagan
administration. He brushed aside questions about Bush's stand on
housing, saying, ``I don't know that he has a policy.''
   Reporters pressed Dukakis on how the process of picking a
running mate is going, especially since he is flying to Washington
on Wednesday to meet with many Democratic senators.
   ``Some of them may be possibilities,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor answered with a flat ``No'' when
asked if Sen. Bob Graham of Florida had been ruled out. He refused
to answer directly about Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, saying only that
he would talk with Nunn on Wednesday.
   Nunn has said he doesn't want to be considered.
   Republicans kept up their fire on Dukakis, with former United
Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick saying he doesn't have the
experience that Bush does.
   ``I don't know Michael Dukakis personally, but we all know that
he has had no opportunity in his life to really devote himself to
foreign affairs. He has been concerned above all with local and
state affairs and George Bush has been concerned with the world,''
she told reporters in Washington.
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign put out new materials on the
Massachusetts prison furlough program that Dukakis has defended and
Bush has criticized. The materials said there had been ``a
dangerous increase'' in the furlough program in the last three
years, including a doubling of furloughs for prisoners convicted of
drug offenses.
   Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications director, responded to the
statement, saying, ``The Bush campaign continues to try and erect a
smoke screen around George Bush's leadership of a failed war
against drugs. Michael Dukakis has run a criminal justice system
that's increased convictions for drug offenses 500 percent in five
years.''
   Democrat Jesse Jackson, speaking Tuesday night to a convention
of Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil rights group he founded,
said federal programs to help minority businesses should be
expanded.
   Jackson told the group, meeting in Rosemont, Ill., that minority
businesses should receive 10 percent of all contracts with federal
agencies.
   ``Minority business enterprise and women's business enterprise
require a national focus and priority commitments in order that
these key areas of our economy can reach their fullest potential,''
Jackson said. ``The set-aside program needs improvement and
expansion, not termination.''
   Meanwhile, Richards, the Democrats' choice for keynote speaker,
got some advice from the 1984 keynoter, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``I said the speech must be yours,'' Cuomo said he told
Richards. ``You should write it and then you should read it to the
people in your office. Not the pros. Forget the pros. ... Do it
with your secretary, with your accountants, with your elevator
operators.
   ``Get the ordinary audience, as much of an ordinary audience as
you can, and you will learn extraordinary things,'' Cuomo said he
told Richards.

   Patrick Kennedy, the 20-year-old son of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, said Tuesday he is running for the Rhode
Island state House of Representatives.
   ``There are no limits to my interest in public service,'' the
Providence College student said as he announced he was seeking a
two-year legislative term. The Democratic primary is Sept. 14.
   Kennedy, the younger son of the Massachusetts senator, will be
challenging a five-term incumbent, Rep. John Skeffington Jr., for
the 9th District Democratic nomination. Skeffington, 50, filed his
candidacy papers Tuesday, while Kennedy said he would do so
Wednesday.
   The contest between the two men heated up weeks ago when
Skeffington expressed disappointment that Kennedy wanted to run
against him.
   ``I can't believe the Kennedys are going to try to knock out a
true Democrat,'' he said then.
   But Kennedy felt no qualms about his action. ``Of course he's
getting challenged, this is what democracy is all about,'' he said.
   ``It's not `the Kennedys' coming in (to the state), it's Patrick
Kennedy,'' Kennedy said.
   ``This is where I've made my home and this is where I plan to
live,'' he said.
   Skeffington, a funeral director, has deep family roots in
Providence's Mount Pleasant section and is well-liked by the
Democratic heirarchy at the statehouse. In 1986, however, he won
renomination by only 185 votes against a 22-year-old political
newcomer.
   The ethnic, blue-collar neighborhood has been strongly
Democratic for decades, and winning the Democratic primary has
virtually guaranteed the winning seat.
   Kennedy said his campaign will focus on issues of crime,
affordable health care and affordable housing.
   Without directly attacking his rival, Kennedy said, ``To be a
good state representative doesn't just mean lounging around, it's
active listening of the people's concerns.''
   Kennedy is president of the Providence College Democrats and was
elected in a March primary as a national convention delegate. He is
pledged to Democratic presidential front-runner Michael S. Dukakis.
   In April, young Kennedy underwent surgery for the removal of a
non-cancerous tumor that had been pressing against his spine.

   Former President Aparicio Mendez, who
was appointed chief of state by the armed forces, died Sunday after
a lengthy illness, officials said. He was 84.
   President Julio Sanguinetti, whose election in 1985 ended the
military's often harsh 12-year rule over this small South American
nation, approved a decree Monday that honored Mendez for his public
service but did not mention his role as de facto president.
   Mendez, seriously ill since 1982, was minister of public health
from 1961-65. Born in Rivera near the Brazilian border, he became a
lawyer and moved to Montevideo. There he played a prominent role in
the National Party, one of the two main parties in Uruguay.
   Mendez was named to the president's council of state in 1973,
then appointed ceremonial president in 1976 by the armed forces, a
post he held five years until succeeded in 1981 by former army Lt.
Gen. Gregorio Alvarez.

   The Soviet Union's most prominent literary journal
wants to publish ``Cancer Ward'' by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the
dissident Soviet author forcibly sent into exile 14 years ago as a
``renegade'' and traitor.
   If the novel is printed here, it would represent a stunning
turnaround in official treatment of Solzhenitsyn, 69, and a further
broadening in the Kremlin's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or greater
openness.
   Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 Nobel literature laureate, earned world
renown and his government's opprobrium in the 1970s for his
chronology of Soviet political repression, ``The Gulag
Archipelago.''
   The editor of the Novy Mir monthly, Sergei P. Zalygin, said
Monday that negotiations for publishing ``Cancer Ward'' were under
way, but declined to say anything more.
   ``Things should become clear in about a week or 10 days,''
Zalygin said in an interview.
   However, Solzhenitsyn's wife, Natalya, was quoted by The New
York Times as saying Monday that Soviet officials have not
approached Solzhenitsyn about publishing any of his works in the
Soviet Union.
   The newspaper said her as saying Solzhenitsyn would not discuss
the report, but that she was speaking on his behalf and that any
talk of possibly publishing ``Cancer Ward'' in the Soviet Union was
``premature to say the least.''
   ``As of today (Monday), Solzhenitsyn has not received any kind
of proposal or other overture about publishing his books'' in the
Soviet Union, she said in a telephone interview from the couple's
Vermont home, according to the Times.
   Twenty years ago, Novy Mir had set ``Cancer Ward'' in type, but
abandoned its plans to print the book in 1968 following the arrest
of several dissidents.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said last year
that Solzhenitsyn owns the copyright to the novel, and that it
could not be published in a Soviet edition without his consent.
   Solzhenitsyn, a former political prisoner, was forcibly exiled
in 1974, and his works were ordered removed from public libraries.
   Before Solzhenitsyn's exile, the Communist Party daily Pravda
called the writer a ``renegade'' and a ``profoundly immoral man,''
and said he merited ``the fate of a traitor.'' It said the Gulag
trilogy was ``another slanderous book'' from his pen.
   Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985,
many Soviet authors whose works were once banned have been
published in Soviet editions including Boris Pasternak's ``Dr.
Zhivago'' and Mikhail Bulgakov's ``Heart of a Dog.''
   But Solzhenitsyn has remained off limits.
   Many of the criticisms leveled by Solzhenitsyn at the bloody
political terror waged by dictator Josef V. Stalin have become
commonplace in Soviet media under Gorbachev.
   In works like the Gulag trilogy, Solzhenitsyn goes beyond
official Soviet thinking by saying that widescale, baseless
repression began under Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin, and that
rule by the officially atheist Communist Party leads to immorality.
   During the Moscow summit, President Reagan made a speech at the
official Writers Union in which he appealed for publication of
Solzhenitsyn's works in his native land.
   Zalygin told reporters then that publication of ``Cancer Ward''
was contingent on an agreement with Solzhenitsyn, and that he was
conducting the negotiations himself.
   In ``Cancer Ward,'' Solzhenitsyn depicts a hospital in Soviet
Kazakhstan at the twilight of Stalin's 29-year reign, which ended
with the dictator's death in 1953. The hospital seems to stand for
Soviet society as a whole, while the cancer the patients suffer
from represents the ravages of Stalin's terror.
   Cultural bureaucrats reportedly ruled out the publication of
``Cancer Ward'' while Solzhenitsyn was still living in the Soviet
Union because they thought the book ``anti-humanist.''
   But Zalygin said he evaluated the novel ``in a positive way. In
my opinion, this is an interesting and serious work.''
   In 1967, Solzhenistyn engaged in acrimonimous and ultimately
futile debate with the Writers Union to push for publication of
``Cancer Ward.''
   In a meeting at the Writers Union headquarters, he said the task
of literature was to ``tell people the real truth as they expect
it,'' and to lay bare the ``secrets of the human heart and
conscience.''
   The head of the Writers Union, Vladimir V. Karpov, spoke Monday
of the possibility of publishing Solzhenitsyn, and said the writer
may even be allowed to return home.
   Karpov said he did not think an official invitation would be
extended to Solzhenitsyn to return.
   Karpov and other Soviet cultural figures met with reporters to
discuss the nationwide Communist Party conference that opens
Tuesday.
   Solzhenitsyn was arrested in 1945 on the grounds that he had
criticized Stalin, and spent eight years in labor camps. He was
released in 1953, and won fame in 1962 when Novy Mir published his
chronicle of Stalin-era prison camp life, ``One Day in the Life of
Ivan Denisovich.''

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Tuesday
that congressional actions led to an attitude of ``We've got to get
ours now'' on the part of defense contractors who are being
investigated for alleged fraud and bribery.
   Meese told a news conference that Congress has put ``so many
layers of requirements'' on Pentagon officials who ``have had to
face up to the fact that budget planning cycles have been ignored
in the congressional appropriations.''
   ``I think some of these (actions) have contributed to some of
the contractors saying, `We've got to get ours now,' and resorting
to some of these practices'' now under investigation, the attorney
general said.
   The investigation being coordinated by Henry Hudson, the U.S.
attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is probing
allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them
former military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of
dollars.
   Meese said the ``Pentagon has been so beset by a lot of things.
... There are problems in the procurement process that are not the
fault of the Pentagon.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said that while he agrees there are too many regulations, many of
them came from within the Pentagon rather than from Congress and he
disputed that such regulations caused the problems under
investigation.
   ``This was caused, from most of what I've heard, by pure old
fraud and corruption,'' Nunn said. ``I don't know of any rule or
law that's passed that would entice someone to sell a government
secret for money.''
   Meese said he met with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci to
discuss sharing information with the Pentagon so that the military
can determine whether it needs to take steps against defense
contractors or consultants.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., recently urged more cooperation
between Carlucci and Meese. Carlucci has said the Pentagon would
not necessarily wait for convictions in the current investigation
before taking steps against contractors.
   Although Meese answered reporter's questions on the probe, he
did not mention that he had removed himself Monday from all
decision-making in the case because his own lawyers are
representing clients involved in it. Justice Department spokesman
Pat Korten confirmed Tuesday night in a telephone interview that
Meese had recused himself from the investigation.
   The attorney general's law firm _ Miller, Cassidy, Larroca &
Lewin _ represents him in a lengthy investigation by independent
counsel James McKay of whether Meese used his public office to
provide favored treatment for friends or companies which may have,
in turn, rewarded him or his family.
   Elsewhere, the Defense Department's top contracting official,
Robert Costello, tried last month to limit searches of defense
plants by investigators looking for corruption.
   In a May 5 memo to Carlucci, a copy of which was obtained by The
Associated Press, the undersecretary of defense for acquisitions
suggested that top Pentagon officials, including himself, be given
veto power over searches of contractor facilities.
   Costello's anger was triggered by a search Feb. 25 at the
Electronic & Space Division of Emerson Electric Co. near St. Louis,
in a fraud investigation that apparently is not related to the
nationwide probe.
   Meanwhile, sources familiar with the probe said investigators
regard as significant potential evidence videotapes of
surreptitiously recorded meetings between Defense Department
personnel and industry consultants.
   More than one of the tapes picked up an audible sound track of
the conversation, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The sources refused to say whether the tapes show money or
confidential government documents changing hands, but one said
``the participants are doing more than talking.''
   One source said ``there aren't that many videotapes, videotapes
are not an extensive technique in the case,'' largely because of
the difficulty of making arrangements to tape a meeting that might
be taking place without much advance notice.
   But the sources said the government regards the videotapes as
important evidence when combined with extensive wiretapping that
has been the basic tool in the investigation to date.
   Sources said over the weekend that among those appearing on the
videotapes are Navy official-turned-consultant Melvyn Paisley and
current Pentagon officials Victor Cohen and James Gaines, both of
whom have been transferred from handling procurement issues while
the investigation is under way.
   ``The mere fact that the government videotapes or records a
meeting or conversation doesn't make that meeting or conversation
illegal,'' said Robert Plotkin, an attorney for Paisley. ``They
used videotapes in the DeLorean case and he was acquitted.''
   Automaker John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine-trafficking
charges in 1984 in a case in which FBI agents posing as drug
dealers conducted videotaped discussions with him. Federal jurors
said they felt DeLorean, who was trying at the time to save his
struggling sports car company, had been entrapped.
   Gaines' attorney, Michael Schatzow, deplored the leaking of
information about the investigation and videotapes, but otherwise
declined to comment.
   Over the weekend, sources said some videotapes show money being
paid to Pentagon personnel, although they declined to specify who
was involved. Those sources said Gaines was videotaped at meetings
in which highly confidential documents relating to Pentagon
contracts allegedly changed hands.
   Paisley was assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems before leaving the government in 1987 to
become a consultant to major defense contractors.
   Cohen is top aide to a deputy assistant Air Force secretary in
charge of buying tactical command, control, communications and
computer systems. Gaines is deputy assistant Navy secretary for
acquisition management.

   _Former Navy Secretary James H. Webb said investigators told him
last fall that Paisley and an unidentified member of Webb's
headquarters staff were under investigation in the defense probe.
Webb said he did not tell Carlucci about the matter because he
figured the FBI would tell him if and when it wished.
   _At the White House, President Reagan got a third update Tuesday
on the status of the investigation. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
reviewed several matters that have been discussed publicly, such as
the reassignment of certain employees.
   The president ``wants the matter cleaned up as rapidly as
possible, both from the standpoint of the investigation of
individuals and the procurement system at the Pentagon,'' Fitzwater
said.
   _The New York Times reported in Wednesday's editions that FBI
agents had searched the home of Richard Seelmeyer, a former
administrative assistant to the late Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo,
D-N.Y., who was chairman of the House subcommittee on defense
appropriations before his death in April 1986.
   The Times said the FBI also searched the Newark, N.J., offices
of the Bryant Ticket Agency, which books seats at entertainment
events.
   Seelmeyer is the publisher of Capitol Hill Defense Digest, a
newsletter about military matters. A telephone listing in Berwin
Heights, Md., for Seelmeyer was busy Tuesday night.
   Hudson has said that no current members of Congress are under
investigation in the probe.
   _Defense Department officials are reviewing formerly closed
cases of alleged contract irregularities that involve people,
companies or contracts identified in connection with the Justice
Department's probe and may reopen six of those cases, Pentagon
Inspector General June Gibbs Brown told The Washington Post for a
story in Wednesday's editions.
   _Plotkin and E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., who represent Paisley and
his wife, Vicki, protested in a letter to prosecutor Hudson ``the
almost daily disclosure of secret investigative information that
subject our clients to trial by innuendo and rumor before this
situation has even been presented to or considered for final action
by the grand jury.''
   They said that Hudson's briefings last week for Reagan and for
members of Congress may have violated rules against disclosures of
matters before grand juries, and in any event ``guarantee that
additional disclosures are likely to occur.''
   They also complained that investigators ``removed all relevant
documents from the Paisleys' home and office, preventing them or
their counsel from adequately reviewing the situation or
substantively responding to the outlandish disclosures.''

   A federal commission approved sites Tuesday
for three new national memorials to women, black and Korean War
veterans, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions that the
National Capital Memorial Commission voted 7-0 to approve federal
park sites in Washington and Arlington, Va., for memorials to women
who in the armed services, blacks who fought in the Revolutionary
War and veterans of the Korean War.
   The newspaper said a Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial
will be located in Constitution Gardens near the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, the Memorial to Women in the Armed Forces will be placed
outside Arlington National Cemetery and the Korean War Memorial
will be erected in Ash Woods near the Lincoln Memorial.
   ``I can't believe (site selection) is finally over,'' retired
Air Force Brig. Gen. Wilma L. Vaught, who heads the Women in
Military Service for America Memorial Foundation, told the
newspaper.
   The foundation had worked to gain site approval since Congress
passed legislation for a women's memorial in 1984.
   The panel approved the sites with the stipulation that final
designs, which have not yet been completed, abide by height and
area restrictions to be determined in future commission discussions.

   The Colossal Tent of the Roaring Lions,
Ponderous Pachyderms, Cavorting Clowns and Doers of Death-Defying
Deeds is 5,000 miles from home, about to dazzle the Mysterious East.
   Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, known here as
``Ringu-Ringu Burathazu ando Bahnamu ando Bairee Sahkasu,'' is
making its first appearance abroad _ 15 weeks in Japan beginning
Friday in the red and yellow Big Top.
   Hundreds of animals and people are assembled on the outskirts of
this northern city, getting ready to astound the Japanese.
   ``I think they'll get a kick out of it,'' said Kenneth Feld, who
produces the wonders of the famous circus. ``It's so visual. It's
not a language thing that they have to understand.''
   But Ringling Brothers is taking no chances about language.
Singing ringmaster Dinny McGuire, besides riding a galumphing
elephant in the opening number, also must deliver his lines in
Japanese.
   ``Amazing elephants! Strange clowns!'' he called out in Japanese
from his unsteady perch during a rehearsal. ``Beautiful showgirls
gathered from all over the world to present to you the wonders of
the circus!''
   Ships, planes, and 100 tractor-trailer trucks delivered McGuire,
25 clowns, a 14-piece band, 16 elephants, 14 lions and assorted
horses, ponies, camels, llamas, humans and equipment for the
three-ring assault on the the Japanese imagination.
   Customs officials poked through scores of containers marked as
containing costumes, shoes, nuts and bolts, but an item labeled
``glue guns'' stopped them, said Mike Fauls, the general manager.
   ``It was a big brouhaha,'' he said. ``It took several meetings
and many days. In the future we'll call them glue `machines.'''
   Haphazard roads and numerous regulations mean the circus will do
most of its moving by sea from the northern island of Hokkaido to
its second stop in Tokyo later this summer and then on to Osaka.
   The 11-day Pacific crossing already has taken its toll on the
elephants, which range from babies to 14,000-pound adults. Feld
said some had lost 800 pounds and were bleary when two Shinto
priests threw confetti on them at a welcoming ceremony June 13.
   He said it cost about $10 million to create the overseas troupe
as a supplement to Ringling's two permanent American tours. Feld
hopes to pack in the Japanese even at ticket prices equivalent to
about $40 a head, and is planning a 25-week tour for next year.
   ``The Japanese people have a lot of money and they work five
days a week now instead of six,'' he said. ``There's no reason we
can't have a circus in Japan six months of the year.
   ``What I hope is to build a tradition so I can come back every
year. Every year Japanese kids will look forward to the Ringling
Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus.''
   Feld doesn't seem bothered that the Soviet Union's Bolshoi
Circus, with a shorter name and decades of appearances here, is
more famous in Japan and is playing at the same time.
   ``Hey!'' he said with a shrug. ``When you're the Greatest Show
on Earth ...''

   Rainshowers over northern India in the
past week have raised hopes of a good harvest after three years of
devastating drought.
   Farmers have dispatched tractors and bullock teams to plow their
dusty brown fields so they can begin sowing the summer crop.
   ``If it keeps raining, it will be fantastic,'' said Ram Phal, a
farmer in Narsinghpur, 25 miles southwest of New Delhi. ``I can
hear frogs croaking at night and that means a good monsoon.''
   While farmers in America's heartland hope for rain to save their
crops, weathermen in India predict this year's monsoon will be
normal this year for the first time since 1984. The last three
summers brought increasing hardship and sometimes hunger to the 534
million Indians _ two-thirds of the total 800 million population _
who depend on agriculture for their livelihood.
   ``I just grew enough to eat at home,'' said Kanwar Singh,
another farmer. ``I haven't been to the grain market for three
years.''
   The annual monsoon is the main source of irrigation for most
Indian crops. When the monsoon failed to materialize last year
after two years of below-normal rainfall, 16 of the country's 25
states suffered.
   Scientists estimate that the drought was the worst in the past
125 years. The government has spent $838 million in drought relief
measures and imported 1.5 million metric tons of cereal to
replenish buffer stocks.
   The imports of grains were the first in five years and came more
than a decade after India announced self-sufficiency in food
production.
   But in the hamlet of Narsinghpur, the macroeconomics of food
imports and production of the past years are overshadowed by clouds
in the skies and smiles on the faces of farmers.
   It is time to sow millet, and the short but timely drizzles
portend a good harvest.
   ``If God gave me clouds and sons every day, wouldn't life be
wonderful,'' said Ram Phal, who owns seven acres around the village
of 500 people. He said one more year of drought would have forced
him to sell part of his holdings.
   The Hindu, a Madras-based newspaper, said Saturday that this
year's monsoon should cover the country by mid-July, auguring well
for the summer crop.
   ``The rains will change the color of the field,'' said Ram Phal,
pointing toward his barren brown farmland now being plowed for
sowing. ``In two weeks, it will all be green.''
   Like other farmers in Haryana state, Ram Phal plants millet in
March and June and wheat in November.
   The Agriculture Ministry said Friday the food output for the
1987-88 growing season was 138 million tons, compared with 152.4
million tons for 1983-84, the last time there was a good monsoon.
   The shortages pushed prices up, and they are unlikely to drop
quickly. Stockpiles must be replenished, and the government already
is warning people _ especially grain dealers _ not to hoard.
   In New Delhi markets, wheat sells for 10 cents a pound, almost
double the 1984 prices.
   ``First there has to be a good monsoon and then a good crop,''
said Bhagwan Das, who owns a grain store in the capital. ``Then
prices will fall. Maybe by the end of the year.''

   Except for one unruly mynah bird who whistled
catcalls, the pets who lined the pews at an annual animal-blessing
church service were obedient.
   Dogs, cats, birds and other animals coexisted peacefully Sunday
during the St. Francis Festival and Blessing of the Animals service
at St. Clement's Episcopal Church.
   The Rev. Brian Nurding, pastor of the church, blessed each of
the animals and spoke about St. Francis of Assisi, the humble saint
known for his warmhearted treatment of animals.
   Nurding said the sixth-annual service was not intended as a
stunt, but served to remind that all creatures sing praises to God.
   Except for a few stray barks and howls, the animals _ mostly
dogs _ were quiet.
   ``Maybe it's something about being in church,'' said Les Chock,
who had his five Shetland sheepdogs blessed.

   Grave robbers have broken into and plundered more
than 1,400 ancient tombs around the ancient Chinese capital of
Luoyang, an official newspaper said today.
   The China Daily said tomb robbing is rampant around the central
China city, capital of several dynasties that date back 3,500
years, and that most of the thieves are peasants who sell their
booty to relics smugglers.
   It said there is a saying among villagers _ ``unearth ancient
tombs to get rich and become a millionaire overnight.''
   In one county near Luoyang, 1,000 people from 100 villages are
involved in tomb robbing. Many, emboldened by light punishment for
those caught, are now banding together to dig up graves during the
daytime, the report said.
   Although the government last year announced a crackdown on
illegal excavating and relics smuggling, offenders are generally
only fined and released, according to the report.
   It also said that in a two-month period last summer, 500 people
in the Luoyang area were discovered smuggling relics. Some
government officials were also found to be involved in smuggling
operations, the daily said.

<HEAD>A Northern Land Celebrates Summer With Almost Pagan Abandon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In Sweden, people take their vacations
seriously.
   Small factories close. Major industries stop production lines.
Neighborhood grocery stores lock up for the summer.
   At a time when alien submarines are constantly reported to be
reconnoitering the Swedish coast, the navy has declared its
sub-hunting unit ineffective for the next month. The sailors are on
vacation, too.
   The government has published a duty roster for July. Only four
or five ministers of the 20-member cabinet are in town.
   All over the country signs are going up: ``Stangt for
Semester,'' Swedish for ``Closed for Vacation.'' It is the national
watchword for the month.
   At least half the 343,000 businesses in Sweden are closing, said
Jan Krylborn, director of the National Swedish Organization of
Small Businesses. Among them are many of this country's 48,000
industrial plants, he said.
   Most companies that remain open are service organizations, ``the
distributors of ice cream and those kind of businesses,'' he added.
   Sweden lives under snow and ice for much of the year, so the
arrival of summer is celebrated with almost pagan abandon.
   ``Midsommar,'' the Friday nearest the summer solstice or the
first day of summer, is a national holiday.
   France and Italy, among other European countries, virtually
close down for the month of August. In Sweden, it comes earlier and
is embedded in legislation.
   Three consecutive vacation weeks during the three summer months
are guaranteed by law to every Swedish worker. Altogether, Swedes
normally get five weeks annual vacation and the governing Social
Democratic Party has made a sixth week part of its campaign
platform for next September's election.
   Most people head for cottages in the countryside or take
pleasure boats through the chain of 24,000 islands stretching along
the Baltic coast. Such luxuries became available to average Swedes
through a long-time policy of cheap tax-deductible credit.
   In addition, Swedes get days off during the year usually
associated with religious holidays. Schoolchildren get one week in
February called ``Sport Recess'' designed for skiing holidays.
   Vacations are sacrosanct, and as the Navy example shows, not
even national security can stand in their way.
   Last year, the military came under fierce criticism for letting
the entire anti-submarine unit go on vacation just after a massive
hunt for a suspected intruder in the sensitive Tore Bay in the
northern Baltic.
   ``This year not all the vessels are unstaffed,'' marine
commander Bengt Shuback told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper. ``But
something like last year could still happen ... We are far from
effective in looking for intruders.''
   The military says foreign submarines have regularly prowled the
coastline of this neutral country for the last decade. Sweden has
not identified the intruders since officially protesting to Moscow
over a 1982 incident.
   Shuback said the navy studied proposals to keep the unit
operational during the summer, such as sending the officers on
expenses-paid winter vacations to the Mediterranean when the Baltic
is frozen.
   The idea was rejected because the officers' wives or girlfriends
would be working and their children would be in school. ``We must
give the staff their legally required three weeks in summer,''
Shuback said.

   The Duchess of York has been preparing for
motherhood by writing children's stories, according to her
publisher.
   Two chidren's books by the 28-year-old former Sarah ``Fergie''
Ferguson are scheduled for publication at about the time of her own
child's first birthday, Simon & Schuster said Monday. She and her
husband, Prince Andrew, are expecting their first child in August.
   The two children's stories, about a helicopter named Budgie,
will be aimed at very young children and will be illustrated by one
of Britain's top children's book illustrators, according to the
publisher.
   The American company is planning to publish the books in August
1989 in association with Simon & Schuster Ltd. of London.
   The duchess has been working on the books with an editor in
London for the past few months, according to the publisher. A
portion of the proceeds will be donated to charity.

   Tonight's ``Late Night with David Letterman''
will be the the first original program since the Writers Guild of
America strike forced the talk show into reruns three months ago.
   Guests on tonight's NBC-TV show include Billy Crystal, Susan
Sarandon, Graham Parker and Los Angeles Lakers coach Pat Reilly.
   As of Monday, Letterman was expecting to come back without his
writers, though the show's producers were trying to work out a
guild waiver that would allow the writing staff to work.
   Head writer Steve O'Donnell stressed last week that whether or
not they were at work, Letterman was going on the air with the
writers' blessings and in no way was trying to disadvantage the
guild, of which Letterman is a member.
   ``We've been having meetings all week and we've decided the best
thing is to get the show on the air,'' O'Donnell said.
   Letterman is not violating the strike as long as he writes his
own material, which he will do if his writers aren't allowed back
to work.
   Johnny Carson, host of NBC's ``Tonight Show,'' returned to the
air last month with Carson writing his own monologue.

   Victoria Sellers, daughter of actress Britt
Eklund and the late Peter Sellers, was ordered to undergo
counseling for violating probation imposed for her role in a
cocaine ring.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon told the 23-year-old actress
Monday that any more violations of her 1987 probation would result
in prison.
   ``The judge made it clear that he was at the end of his rope and
she was at the end of her tether,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Mark Werksman.
   Miss Sellers was on probation after pleading guilty in federal
court in New Jersey to one count of failing to report a crime as
part of her role in a cocaine ring headed by Reed Wallace, her
agent and housemate.
   Miss Sellers was ordered to undergo 600 hours of community
service by a judge who said the actress fell victim to a hedonistic
lifestyle.
   This month, she admitted to violating probation by testing
positive for cocaine, failing to report for drug testing, missing
her $75-a-month payments on a $500 fine and leaving the Los Angeles
area without permission.
   Kenyon decided against a prison term, but ordered her to attend
four Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings a week
and enter a special therapy session with a psychologist, in
addition to the terms of her probation.

   Voter registration tables and job training
information booths are as much a part of a Run-DMC concert as the
stage.
   ``When I was coming up, there weren't really any role models
coming from the street, hanging on the same corners, going through
the same problems that I had, to tell me what to do,'' said Darryl
McDaniels, the DMC part of the group.
   In a telephone interview before the group's trip here for a
concert Monday night, McDaniels said: ``I guess since Run-DMC is
successful, and we're still B-Boy hard-core rap, the kids look up
to that. They think `Yeah, those guys made it by doing that, maybe
I can do it.'''
   He finishes his thought rapfully: ``The things I do made me a
star _ you can be too, if you know who you are _ put your mind to
it you'll go real far _ like the pedal to the metal when you're
driving a car.''
   McDaniels and his fellow rappers, Joseph ``Run'' Simmons and
Jason ``Jam Master Jay'' Mizell, dedicated a basketball court they
donated to a South Central housing project during a recent stop in
Los Angeles.
   On their 70-city tour, including the group's appearance at the
Greek Theater here, they have NAACP voter-registration tables and
National Alliance of Business job-training booths set up in concert
hall lobbies.

   Comedian Arsenio Hall's first movie role is
based on a character he plays in real life: a friend of Eddie
Murphy.
   In ``Coming to America,'' Hall plays the role of Semmi, a
confidante of Murphy's Prince Akeem, who has come to America from a
mythical African nation to find a bride.
   Hall, who shot to fame and a contract with Paramount Pictures
after his stint as a host of the Fox Television Network ``Late
Night'' show, said he and Murphy first met backstage at a Los
Angeles comedy club.
   ``Eddie's mom saw me on the tube,'' Hall said recently. ``She
told him, `I thought I saw you, but it was some guy who looks like
you or acted like you. His name was Arsenio Hall.'''
   Murphy, who was on the West Coast after signing for his first
movie, ``48 Hrs.,'' went to see Hall at The Improv.
   ``He came up afterward. I knew who he was from `Saturday Night
Live,''' Hall said.
   ``And he said `You don't look like me.' I looked at him and
laughed. `Who said I did?' And then he said his mother did, and I
guess he was kind of embarrassed, because he said, `Hey, let's hang
out.' And we did, and we've been buddies ever since.''

<TEXT>
   Convicted murderer Jean Harris' new book gives a
first-hand look at how women were treated in prison recently.
   The book's title, ``They Always Call Us Ladies: Stories From
Prison,'' is derived from how the prison refers to its inmates.
   ``As late as 1983, the official package room list issued to me
aid I was allowed to have two jock straps and 200 cigars per month.
Nowhere did it list a brassiere or lipstick,'' the former
headmistress of the exclusive Madeira School for Girls in McLean,
Va., writes.
   ``Inmates at Bedford were referred to as `girls,' or `our
girls,' and under one superintendent as `those poor devils,' until
1970 when someone ordered that we be called `ladies,''' Harris
writes. ``Today, it is the one rule that seems to have been carved
deep into the brain of every C.O. (commanding officer). They always
call us `ladies,' no matter what we're doing.''
   This is the second book by Harris, who is serving a
15-year-to-life sentence for murdering Scarsdale Diet author Dr.
Herman Tarnower. Her first, the autobiographical ``Stranger in Two
Worlds,'' was a best seller in 1986.
   ``They Always Call Us Ladies'' is a history of the Bedford Hills
Correctional Facility since its founding as a women's reformatory
in 1901. It also contains anecdotes about current inmates and
prison life, and is scheduled for publication Aug. 17 by Charles
Scribner's Sons.
   Harris and Tarnower were lovers. She shot the 69-year-old diet
doctor to death in his home on March 10, 1980, because he was
supposedly leaving her for a younger woman. While Harris contends
she shot Tarnower four times by accident as he tried to stop her
from committing suicide, jurors concluded she deliberately killed
him because he was ending their relationship.
   The 65-year-old Harris, who is not eligible for parole until
1996, works in the prison's innovative Children's Center. Bedford
Hills has a nursery where inmates can keep their babies for a full
year after birth.
   Working, writing and teaching has occupied much of Harris' time
while imprisoned. Teaching, she has maintained, ``will cure
anything short of the common cold,'' and ``it is only through our
children,'' she has said, ``that we can make a better world.''
   Prisons should work to keep family ties taut, and prisons should
work to get prisoners to read and write and develop moral
reasoning, Harris says.
   Inmates in New York generally aren't eligible for clemency until
they have served half their minimum sentence, which is 1988 for
Harris. Last year, her lawyer, Michael Kennedy, urged Gov. Mario
Cuomo to issue a waiver for Harris, saying she was ill and had done
good work on behalf of the children of Bedford Hills inmates.
Harris has had two heart attacks while in prison.
   Cuomo turned down the request for early clemency review.

<HEAD>Poll Finds New Yorkers Critical of Brawley Advisers, Mother</HEAD>

   A majority of New Yorkers surveyed said Tawana
Brawley's mother and advisers have not handled her case
responsibly, a poll has found.
   In New York City, 55 percent of black respondents and 84 percent
of whites surveyed also said the three advisers to the black
Dutchess County teen-ager are using her case for their own
``personal advantage,'' according to results of a New York
Times-WCBS-TV News Poll in Tuesday's editions of the Times.
   Among New York City blacks surveyed, 62 percent said Miss
Brawley's advisers had not acted responsibly, while 17 percent said
they had acted responsibly. The remainder said they did not know or
declined to answer.
   Among whites surveyed in the city, 83 percent answered ``not
responsibly'' while 5 percent said ``responsibly.''
   Fifty-seven percent of New York City blacks polled said Miss
Brawley's mother, Glenda, had not acted responsibly, while 21
percent said the opposite. Whites polled, by 85 percent to 6
percent, said she had not acted responsibly.
   Mrs. Brawley has been taking sanctuary in a Brooklyn church to
evade a court order for her arrest. She had been ordered to serve a
30-day jail sentence for refusing to answer a grand jury subpoena
to testify about her daughter's disappearance.
   In addition, the poll found that in New York City, a large
majority of white respondents and a plurality of blacks surveyed
said the advisers were lying when they said Miss Brawley had been
abducted and raped by white men in Dutchess County last November.
   Among white respondents in the city, 9 percent said the advisers
were telling the truth, 71 percent said they were lying and 20
percent had no answer. Among blacks polled, 28 percent said they
were telling the truth and 37 percent said they were lying, while
35 percent had no opinion.
   The Times said the pattern of ``expressed disbelief and
hostility'' was even stronger in interviews conducted in the
Wappingers Falls area, where the Brawleys live.
   The survey also found that the advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton,
and lawyers Alton H. Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, who have
counseled Miss Brawley not to cooperate with authorities _ are
widely viewed unfavorably by both blacks and whites. The view
represents a sharp shift in attitudes among blacks since January,
the Times reported.
   The telephone poll, of 1,131 adults _ 676 in New York City and
455 in the Wappingers Falls area _ was conducted Tuesday through
Saturday.
   The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4 percentage
points for the New York City total, and plus or minus 6 percentage
points for whites or blacks separately.

   President Reagan expressed a willingness to
broaden anti-discrimination protections for people suffering from
AIDS, saying the nation should confront the deadly disease ``in a
thoughtful and bipartisan manner.''
   ``We've got to get moving to give people hope,'' Reagan said
Monday after getting the AIDS commission's final report. He told an
adviser to prepare ``a course of action'' for the administration
within 30 days.
   The president proposed one concrete step in a statement that for
the most part complimented the 13-member commission for its work in
raising ``our level of understanding'' about AIDS.
   Reagan came close to embracing a principal recommendation of the
study commission _ that Office of Personnel Management guidelines
spelling out protections for people with AIDS be mandatory for all
government agencies.
   He said at the suggestion of retired Adm. James D. Watkins, the
commission's chairman, he had directed the aide, Dr. Ian MacDonald,
to ``include among his priorities consideration of specific
measures to strengthen implementation of the policy guidance'' from
the OPM guidelines.
   The OPM oversees the federal government's civilian work force,
numbering more than 2.3 million.
   Many people active in the battle against the spread of the
deadly disease have said they believe it is vitally important to
assure people infected by the virus that causes AIDS that they will
be protected against discrimination at work and in medical
insurance coverage.
   ``The president should issue an executive order banning
discrimination on the basis of handicap, with HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) infection included as a handicapping
condition,'' the panel said in its report.
   Watkins told reporters he was elated with Reagan's willingness
to consider signing just such an order.
   Watkins, talking to reporters in the White House driveway, said
while he did not want to jump to conclusions, Reagan's statement
``sends the first signal that we're on the way'' toward protecting
victims of the disease under the law.
   The former chief of naval operations said the commission hopes
the OPM guidelines, which other federal agencies may embrace
voluntarily, will be made mandatory by Reagan in an executive order.
   He said such a signal is needed because anti-discrimination
policies in the various states differ, and this has left a
confusing mix of court decisions on discrimination suits.
   ``We've pointed out that we think it's time to bring the country
together on that issue,'' Watkins said.
   When pressed to say whether Reagan had made a commitment to sign
such an executive order, he said, ``Well, take it easy. I think
it's coming.''
   Besides urging Reagan to sign an executive order, the AIDS
commission urged the broadening of Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to include protection for workers in
private life.
   Watkins called Reagan a ``compassionate humanitarian'' and said
he believed the president's thinking had changed somewhat on AIDS.
He said Reagan related an anecdote about a woman who had written
him, telling him how two of her children became infected from the
AIDS virus as a result of a blood transfusion she once had.
   ``The president felt moved by the story, and I told the
president this was not atypical,'' Watkins said.
   ``I want to express my sincere appreciation to Admiral Watkins
and all of the commission participants for their perseverance and
diligence in completing their work,'' Reagan's statement said. ``It
is my hope that we can continue to approach this problem, which is
more than a medical crisis or a public health threat, in a
thoughtful and bipartisan manner.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. No one is
known to have recovered from AIDS, which most often is spread
through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from
infected persons.
   Most victims have been male homosexuals or intravenous drug
abusers.
   As of June 13, AIDS had been diagnosed in 64,896 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 36,480, have died, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control.

aboard a 71-foot-long 1910 Pullman rail car was a moving experience.
   Once the couple tied the knot, a piercing whistle blew and the
partly-restored coach carrying the wedding party chugged north,
dragging 55-gallon drums.
   The Andrews ended their wedding day Saturday by traveling 40
miles from Othello to Moses Lake aboard the rail car, stopping at
Warden to pick up relatives for part of the ride.
   ``I don't think anybody in town is surprised,'' Andrews said.
``It's gotten so the car is kind of an extension of me, people
think of it when they hear my name.''
   When he bought the train car in 1984, he joked that it was lucky
he was single. ``I'm married to this car,'' he said then of his
$50,000 investment that cost another $50,000 to refurbish. ``A wife
wouldn't like the competition.''
   But, the groom added, ``It may take me a little longer to
restore it now that I have other interests.''

   Several families are reducing their garbage
piles with help from a labor force that demands no wages, takes no
breaks, requires no supervision and needs only a warm bed and a few
food scraps.
   They're earthworms.
   Pierce County officials presented a bowl full of the slimy
creatures last week to nine families volunteering for a recycling
and composting project.
   The families were told the worms convert food into soil in a
process called composting _ if they are kept in a box with moist
bedding and fed food scraps.
   The county is teaching the families how to reduce waste dumped
in the landfills, which have polluted the groundwater and must be
closed by 1991 unless the dumping volume is reduced significantly.

<HEAD>Ham Radio Operators Look for Alternative Power Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As power sources go, electric
eels aren't too practical, but ham radio operators say in the event
of a worldwide disaster, the animals beat pushing a Volkswagen van
up a 3-mile hill.
   Ham radio operators staged a 24-hour demonstration Saturday to
test the resourcefulness of operators who provide emergency
communications for the Red Cross in times of trouble.
   At the Vancouver Aquarium in Stanley Park, a red, 40-watt
lightbulb flickered below a huge tank where two fat, 5-foot eels
swam lazily back and forth.
   Electrodes in the water carry the Amazonian eels' bursts of
power _ up to 600 volts _ to the bulb and a regulating circuit that
helps charge a special radio battery.
   ``It's the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that anyone
has stored eel power,'' said operator Steve Buchan.
   During the simulation, operators must find ways to generate
power for their radios when conventional power sources are out of
commission. Wall sockets are off limits.
   ``There are people in California right now who are pushing a
Volkswagen van 3 miles up a hill with the engine turned off and
then letting it go down the hill, generating enough power to
communicate till it gets to the bottom of the hill,'' Buchan said.
``But we think we have them beat. Biological power is something
that's unique.''
   About 250,000 ham radio operators in 140 countries _ including
the Soviet Union where ham radios reportedly are tightly controlled
_ participated in the simulation, Buchan said.
   Besides the eel-powered radios, the Communications Vancouver
team demonstrated a satellite link-up using a Soviet satellite. It
made transmissions as clear as a cross-town telephone call, instead
of the compressed radio signals that often make voices sound like
Daffy Duck.

<HEAD>Washington Wire: Sen. Lugar Advises Next President to `Tell The
Truth'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this election year, candidates for the
Republican and Democratic presidential nominations are being
flooded with advice.
   Advice on how best to run and win.
   Advice on what to do and say.
   Advice on what not to do and say.
   Advice on what to d if the previous advice proves effective and
a prospective president becomes president in fact.
   One advice giver _ Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. _ has put his
advice in more formal form than usual, enclosing it in the 269
pages of a hardcover book.
   The book: ``Letters To The Next President,'' published by Simon
and Schuster, deals with the foreign policy challenges and
opportunities the next chief executive will face and is based in
large part on Lugar's two years' service as chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in 1985 and 1986.
   In the book, as in his chairmanship, Lugar pursues restoration
of a bipartisan foreign policy based on a drive to extend democracy
throughout the world.
   He also thinks it important that in an often duplicitous world,
the president of the United States tell the truth.
   Because he wrote before George Bush and Michael Dukakis clinched
the Republican and Democratic presidential nominations, Lugar's
advice is general and not tailored to any particular candidate.
   But he warns all candidates to resist the temptation to
``express extreme views on foreign policy that may capture
temporary political allegiances but may also undermine longstanding
policy objectives and cause general dismay.''
   Lugar maintains that whoever wins the 1988 presidential
sweepstakes must have as a primary goal ending the foreign policy
war between the White House and Congress.
   ``In the past few years, we have suffered through too many
partisan impasses in foreign policy, too much finger pointing, and
too little assumption of responsibility,'' Lugar said.
   ``These letters are in part a signal from one senator that
enough is enough.''
   Lugar dismisses the notion that the 435 members of the House of
Representatives and the 100 members of the Senate seek collective
status as 535 secretaries of state, endlessly interfering with the
building of an effective foreign policy.
   ``Relatively few members spend the time and the energy required
to articulate comments on the myriad of daily international
events,'' Lugar said.
   At the same time, Lugar believes Congress has a constitutional
duty to be involved in the formulation and execution of foreign
policy. He appealed to the next president to reach out to
congressional leaders often.
   ``You have to work with Congress,'' Lugar advises the next
president. ``It will be exasperating but essential if you want to
succeed.''
   Pointing to the Iran-Contra affair in the Reagan administration,
Lugar concludes that excessive secretiveness and refusal to consult
closely with Congress are a prescription for disaster.
   The senator says he is prepared to argue that President Reagan
had the right to trade arms to Iran in the hope that would lead to
the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon and to organize
private support for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``But I will also argue that any president who undertakes such
policies with the determination to keep them secret from the
public, the Congress and from his own administration will
jeopardize severely his credibility and his policies once his
secret efforts leave the cocoon,'' he said.
   Lugar has much specific advice.
   He would have the next president retain the Strategic Defense
Initiative, develop bipartisan support for it and convince the
Soviet Union that an effective defense against nuclear attack is in
their interests as well as in the interest of the United States.
   He believes bipartisan consensus can be achieved on an effective
policy ``to convince our adversaries that we will take the
appropriate steps to prevent Nicaragua from injuring the
fundamental security of its neighbors or of the United States.''
   He believes an armed resistance will continue to be necessary if
Nicaragua's Sandinista regime fails to embrace democratic reforms.
   He advises the next president to respect the letter and spirit
of the War Powers Act.
   But some of his advice is as general as it is emphatic.
   It is essential, Lugar says, that the next president ``tell the
truth,'' no matter how often he is told the world is managed best
by deception, guile and cunning.
   Lugar maintains that the president of the United States must
live by another, higher standard.
   ``Even when his international colleagues are deep into intrigue
and falsehood, they need to know our president is telling the truth
and that our foreign policy is based on telling the truth.''
   The American people need to have every reason to believe what
their president is saying, Lugar says.
   ``The president must maintain his veracity from the beginning to
the end of his administration _ or make way for someone else who
will do so.''

<HEAD>Random Drug Tests To Begin At Justice Department; Lawsuit
Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III has told
employees that random drug testing will begin at Justice Department
headquarters in two months to assure the public that ``those who
enforce the laws are themselves upholding the law.''
   The notice, to 6,500 Justice Department employees, said testing
will be performed when there is reasonable suspicion of drug use.
For about 1,800 employes who hold sensitive positions there will be
random testing without such suspicion.
   Meese's announcement Monday was met with a promise that suit
would be filed in federal court today, challenging the order on
constitutional grounds.
   The testing is the result of an executive order by President
Reagan two years ago directing the government to produce a
drug-free workplace. Meese said a year of planning had gone into
putting the program into practice.
   In the foreword of a booklet, Meese explained that ``the 60-day
notice period provides any employee who may be using drugs the
opportunity to stop using drugs well before the random testing
actually begins.''
   The program has a ``safe harbor'' provision under which any
employee who voluntarily admits illegal drug use, enters a
treatment program and stops using drugs, will not be disciplined.
   About 7 percent of the employees in certain categories _ 450
people _ will be tested, the booklet said. All persons selected for
hiring will also be subject to testing.
   The categories were listed as presidential appointees, those
directly engaged in criminal law enforcement activities, those
entrusted with drugs, those who require top secret or higher
security clearances, those suspected of drug use and volunteers.
   Stephen H. Sachs, former attorney general of Maryland and a
former U.S. attorney who is now in private practice, said he would
file suit on behalf of 40 Justice Department employees.
   ``The heart of our objection is that the plans mandate acts of
urination and then subject that urine to chemical analysis to see
what secrets it reveals _ without any basis or showing that the
individual in question is a drug abuser that that there is reason
to believe he is a drug abuser,'' Sachs said.
   ``The government couldn't do that to you or me as non-employees
and our contention is that when you become a government employee
you don't check your Constitutional rights at the door.''
   Sachs said he plans next week to file for a preliminary
injunction to stop testing while the suit is pending.
   Meese said the Justice Department, having primary law
enforcement responsibilities, should lead the way for the rest of
the federal government.
   ``For any of our employees to use illegal drugs is to compromise
the department's law enforcement mission,'' Meese said. ``In order
to have the public's cooperation in the war against drugs, it is
crucial that the public be assured that those who enforce the laws
are themselves upholdng the law.''

<HEAD>Pre-Election Interest Rate Rise by Fed Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve will boost a key interest
rate within the next month and then hope that credit-tightening
move will be enough to keep inflation in check until the November
election, many analysts believe.
   These economists said they expect the Fed to increase its
discount rate, the interest the central bank charges on loans to
member banks, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   The Fed has already executed a series of three tightening moves
beginning in late March, but it has held back from increasing its
discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the central bank can
make to demonstrate its intention to push interest rates higher.
   The last change in the discount rate occurred last September,
when it was increased from 5.5 percent to 6 percent. That hike has
been blamed in part for precipitating the October collapse of stock
prices.
   The central bank's policy-making committee, the Federal Open
Market Committee, meets Wednesday and Thursday behind closed doors
to discuss the conduct of monetary policy. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan will report on the panel's deliberations in an appearance
before the Senate Banking Committee on July 13.
   Many economists believe the Fed is ready to tighten credit
conditions even further because of inflationary pressures in the
U.S. economy.
   Lyle Gramley, a former member of the Fed, said he believed the
central bank probably would raise the discount rate in July,
especially if the unemployment report for June indicates a surge in
new jobs.
   ``The Fed's main concern has to be that the economy may be
growing too fast and that pressure on wages and prices will be
building as the year goes on,'' said Gramley, who is now chief
economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Gramley said he was looking for the increase in the discount
rate to occur in July because he believes the central bank will
want to get it over with well before the fall presidential election
campaign.
   ``The Fed doesn't like to raise the discount rate if political
criticism can be generated, but they also don't want the rate to
get so far out of touch with the market that they are open to
criticism that they are subsidizing banks who are borrowing from
them,'' he said.
   In late March and then again in early May and late May, the Fed
acted to tighten interest rates by restricting the amount of money
banks have for making loans. The central bank's goal was to
restrain credit and thereby restrain overall demand in the economy.
   The moves have been followed by a general rise in a variety of
interest rates. Major banks boosted their prime lending rate
one-half percentage point in early May to 9 percent. Mortgage
rates, which had dropped to 9.84 percent in February, began rising
and now stand at 10.4 percent for fixed-rate loans.
   Analysts said rates are likely to head higher for the rest of
the year, propelled by the tighter-money policy being pursued by
the Fed and by faster-than-expected economic growth.
   ``We think that sustained growth through 1989 will keep interest
rates on a general uptrend,'' said Roger Brinner, senior economist
at Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass.
   Analysts said while they expected further credit tightening on
the part of the central bank, it might not come at this week's
meeting. They said there is no pressing need to reassure financial
markets of the bank's resolve to fight inflation.
   Bond markets in the United States have rallied after being
buffeted by inflation fears a few weeks ago and the dollar has been
surging in value, in part because foreign investors have regained
confidence in the U.S. economy.
   The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
grew at a brisk 3.6 percent annual rate in the first three months
of the year, but many analysts believe that growth rate has slowed
to a more sustainable 2.5 percent rate in the current April-June
quarter, a pace less likely to raise concerns of overheating.
   However, the recent good news is balanced against other
pressures such as the drought in the Midwest which is expected to
drive food prices higher.
   ``The severe drought conditions can change the whole psychology
of inflation with higher prices at food stores putting pressure on
wages as Americans find their purchasing power constrained,'' said
David Jones, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
government securities dealer.

   The fledgling private American space launch
industry has signed 20 customers already and may have 10 more by
the end of the year, the Transportation Department says.
   The first of the private launches, a communications satellite
for the government of India, is scheduled for launch next March by
McDonnell Douglas, according to a ``manifest,'' or list, released
Monday by the department.
   ``The manifest illustrates the significant success American
launch firms have had in capturing the major share of the world
launch markets,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley.
``American firms won 13 launch contracts last year compared to just
two by the European consortium, Ariane.''
   The commercial launchers will use federal facilities, mostly at
Cape Canaveral, Fla., and will reimburse the government for all
costs.
   Burnley said the launch contracts will provide 8,000 jobs.
   ``Eleven of the manifested payloads will be launched for foreign
customers and will offset the U.S. balance of payments by as much
as $660 million,'' he said. ``The commercial launch sector may very
well be the most active part of America's non-military space
program for the next several years.''
   Eight of the satellites on the list previously had been
scheduled for launch from the space shuttle. Late in 1986, after
the Challenger accident grounded shuttle flights, President Reagan
fostered a private launch industry by ordering the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration out of the business.
   The schedule announced by Burnley is subject to delays, not the
least of which may come because of a shortage of ammonium
perchlorate, a component of solid rocket fuel. One of the two U.S.
plants that manufacture the fuel was destroyed in an explosion May
4.
   Burnley said allocation of the scarce fuel is being worked out
among NASA, the Defense Department and his agency and that
commercial launch companies are looking for supplies from
manufacturers in Europe and Japan.
   Two of the 20 missions are suborbital flights for gravity
research, using light rockets. Seven flights are for the U.S.
government, four are for international consortia, three are for the
British and one each is for Indonesia, Japan, India and a European
consortium.
   McDonnell Douglas is launching eight of the cargoes, General
Dynamics six and Martin Marietta four. A Maryland company, Conatec,
is handling the light rocket launches.

<HEAD>Anti-Abortionists' Single-Home Picketing Blocked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Picketers who carry their protests into
residential neighborhoods will have to cover more ground to assure
compliance with laws condoned in a new Supreme Court ruling.
   The court, saying ``there simply is no right to force speech
into the home of an unwilling listener,'' ruled that communities
may ban picketing aimed specifically at someone's home.
   But the justices unanimously rejected arguments in a case from
Wisconsin that public streets in residential neighborhoods are not
the type of traditional public forum where freedom of expression is
protected.
   The ruling therefore did not free communities to ban pickets
from marching through a residential neighborhood, or even walking
back and forth along a block on which the home they want to target
is located.
   Sandra Schultz, head of an anti-abortion group barred from
picketing a doctor's home in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield,
Wis., said the ruling makes a ``silly distinction'' between
picketing in front of one home and marching past numerous homes.
   ``I'm a little confused about ... how far we have to go down the
street before it's legal,'' she said. ``We will just change our
tactics and go a little farther down the street. It won't deter our
movement.''
   Harold Furhman, the lawyer who represented Brookfield before the
high court, said, ``I'm very delighted with the decision. This is
consistent with their past decisions and also with the position the
town took in interpreting the ordinance.''
   Steven Shapiro of the American Civil Liberties Union said the
court went too far in seeking to protect the privacy of the home.
   ``There were less intrusive ways to go about this,'' he said.
``The interest in privacy can be protected by regulating picketing
without banning it. The court rejected less drastic alternatives.''
   The decision also could hamper unions seeking to picket the
homes of management officials during labor disputes. The AFL-CIO
had urged the justices to invalidate the Brookfield ordinance,
which outlaws ``picketing before or about the residence or dwelling
of any individual.''
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, interpreted
the ordinance narrowly, stating that it is limited to ``picketing
taking place solely in front of a particular residence.''
   ``The ordinance permits the more general dissemination of a
message,'' O'Connor said. ``General marching through residential
neighborhoods, or even walking a route in front of an entire block
of houses, is not prohibited by this ordinance.''
   The Milwaukee Coalition for Life demonstrated in front of Dr.
Benjamin Victoria's home in Brookfield on at least six occasions in
1985.
   Victoria performs abortions as part of his medical practice in
Milwaukee and Appleton, Wis.
   The demonstrators, in groups ranging in size from 11 to more
than 40 people, carried signs protesting abortion and shouted
slogans, such as ``Dr. Victoria, you're a killer.''
   In the month that the picketing occurred, the Brookfield Town
Board enacted the disputed ordinance.
   Lower courts refused to let Brookfield enforce the ordinance but
those rulings were overturned Monday.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled, 5-4, that defense contractors enjoy broad protection
from lawsuits when defective equipment they sell to the military
causes death or injury.
   _Eased the potential consequences for law enforcement officials
who conduct unlawful searches by ruling, 4-3, in a Boston case that
evidence initially discovered during a warrantless search may be
used at trial if the same evidence is ``rediscovered'' during a
second, lawful search.
   _Said a Los Angeles-based anti-poverty law firm is entitled to
recover legal fees for successfully challenging the withholding of
its clients' federal housing subsidies. But the court split 6-2 in
saying the $322,700 awarded by lower courts was excessive.

<HEAD>New Projections To Show Drought Damage To Crops</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note 9:30 a.m. EDT embargo on final item.</NOTE>

   New projections aimed at showing how much
damage the drought has done to this year's harvests will be issued
in two weeks by the Agriculture Department.
   The special forecast will be in USDA's regular crop report on
July 12 and will include new figures adjusted for damage done by
this year's heat and drought, Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson,
who oversees the department's economic and statistical services,
said Monday.
   Under normal conditions, the July crop report would include
updated production and yield-per-acre estimates for winter wheat,
which is now being harvested across the nation's midsection.
Similar field estimates for corn, spring wheat, soybeans, cotton
and other fall-harvested crops are not scheduled until August.
   That has not changed. The August crop report will still be the
first big-scale estimate of U.S. crops, Wilson said.
   But the July 12 report will include freshly revised
``projections'' of corn and other fall crops based on the latest
drought and acreage information, he said. The projections now being
used began in May, based on past trends and other assumptions that
no longer apply.
   Wilson, in an interview, said that the 1988-89 projections based
on the trend lines of past years would be wrong and that ``we would
be way off the right numbers'' for this year's harvests.
   ``We're going to move away from that trend-yield estimate and
make some adjustments based on what we know about crop
conditions,'' he said. ``We won't be doing a (field) survey because
it's too early in the season. But we'll do some analysis which will
move us off that trend-line yield in order to reflect the impact of
the drought.''
   Wilson said the special project to come up with better figures
for harvest prospects and anticipated demand through the 1988-89
marketing season was not unique and that USDA had done it before.
   Isn't it risky for USDA economists and statisticians to stick
their necks out regarding drought losses, even if the figures are
acknowledged to be little better than educated guesses at this time?
   ``I think we're in a year where, if they put out a trend-line
projection, they would be sticking their necks out even more,
because, clearly, no one believes the trend yield is going to the
the actual yield this year,'' Wilson said. ``It's reflecting
reality.''
   Earlier this month, when the winter wheat harvest was updated,
the supply-and-demand analysis _ based on the trend lines described
by Wilson _ included projections showing that this fall's corn
harvest would be around 7.3 billion bushels, an increase from 7.06
billion bushels harvested in 1987.
   Soybean production, using the trend-line method, was projected
on June 9 at 1.88 billion bushels, just slightly less than the 1.9
billion bushels produced last year.

   The Agriculture Department says China's grain
production may increase by as much as 25 percent to around 500
million metric tons by the year 2000 from an average of 394 million
tons in the 1980s.
   ``Area sown to grain probably will decrease over the next 12
years, but improved yields could boost total output,'' analysts
said Monday. ``However, per capita consumption probably will rise
slowly, as gains in output may be offset by increases in population
and (livestock) feed use.''
   Although small amounts of corn and other so-called coarse grains
are likely to be exported by efficient producers in the northeast
and rice producers in the south, China is expected to remain a net
grain importer.
   ``Coastal urban areas will import sizable quantities of wheat
for human consumption and limited quantities of feed grains,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   U.S. agricultural exports to China in the fiscal year that began
last Oct. 1 could exceed $400 million in value, about double the
$211 million of 1986-87, the report said. A number of subsized
sales of U.S. wheat have helped account for the increase.

   A study released today by two national farm
organizations said government farm programs have provided only
limited relief and it's time to face reality about the American
farmer's capacity to overproduce.
   ``Excess capacity is back and it is back with a vengeance,'' the
report said. ``Predictions in the '70s that agriculture would never
again be plagued with over-supplies were dead wrong.''
   The study, by two former Oklahoma State University professors of
economics, Daryll E. Ray and James S. Plaxico, was sponsored
jointly by the National Farmers Organization and the National
Farmers Union.
   Agricultural policies embodied in the 1985 farm law calling for
reduced federal supports as a way to stimulate exports and the
agricultural economy ``have generated expectations about how
agricultural markets will react to over-supplies that cannot be
fulfilled,'' the report said. While an agricultural world based on
supply and demand has wide appeal, ``it is a fantasy.''
   The erratic nature of agriculture, depending on weather and
markets, requires a long view, the report said.
   ``Neither aberrations of the '70s (when exports soared) or the
rhetoric of the '80s has changed the fundamental characteristics of
the grains markets that have long caused price and income problems
for farmers,'' it said. ``If we want to continue to have a
world-class agriculture, we must accept the fact that agriculture
is inherently unstable from production period to production period
and across decades.''

<HEAD>Study: One-Parent Children Get Less Schooling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Boys who spend part of their childhood in
one-parent families tend to leave school earlier than those who
live with both parents, according to a new study.
   There was much less impact on girls, who may be motivated by the
example of a working mother, say researchers Sheila Fitzgerald
Krein and Andrea H. Beller of the School of Human Resources and
Family Studies at the University of Illinois-Urbana.
   Their study, which also noted that the impact of one-parent
living on children is greatest in the pre-school years, was
published in Demography, the journal of the Population Association
of America.
   A working mother, supporting herself and family, seems to
provide a good example for daughters, Beller said Monday in a
telephone interview.
   For girls, this model seems to balance out the loss of the time
and involvement of one parent, ``whereas the boy doesn't have this
model, he just has the loss of a parent.''
   About 60 percent of all children are now estimated to spend at
least some of their childhood with only one parent around, Krein
and Beller reported.
   ``This trend has aroused social concern in part because these
families typically have fewer resources, in particular time and
money...than two-parent families,'' they pointed out.
   ``Educational advancement is one route out of poverty, but the
children in these families get significantly less of it,'' the
report says. ``Thus, this lower level of education will have
long-term consequences for the economic well-being of the future
family of this young adult.''
   Krein and Beller said they studied effects on education because
it ``has been shown to be a predictor of welfare recipiency and
persistent poverty'' and ``lack of education is one determinent of
chronic unemployment.''
   They used a pair of long-term surveys to study two generations
of mothers and their offspring, totaling 2,500 boys and girls.
   ``In general, the longer time spent in a single-parent family,
the greater the reduction in educational attainment,'' they found.
   The largest impact was among white males, they reported, with
each year spent in a one-parent family reducing eventual education
by about one-tenth of a year.
   ``White men who spent an average number of years (5.1) in a
single-parent family completed 0.5 fewer years of schooling than
those who spent none; white men who spent all 18 years in a
single-parent family completed 1.7 fewer years of schooling,'' they
found.
   The average number of years with just one parent around was
found to be 8.0 years for black males, and those in that situation
finished 0.6 fewer years of school. Black males spending 18 years
with just one parent finished 1.3 fewer years of school.
   The impact was much less significant for women.
   Indeed, for white women time spent in a single-parent family had
no impact on eventual education. There was only a slight impact for
black women.
   A follow-up study, not yet published, found that the effect of
the missing parent is reduced, although not eliminated, when the
father pays child support, Beller said.
   In these cases, though the father may not be present he still
serves as a good example and ``that affects educational attainment
in positive direction,'' the study said.
   The greatest impact on eventual education was among youngsters
whose pre-school years were spent in one-parent families, the study
said. ``Years spent in a single-parent family during the elementary
school and high-school periods have no significant impact.''
   ``Since the pre-school years matter most, affordable day-care
with an educational component could replace some of the functions
of the absent parent,'' the study says.
   Living in a family with brothers and sisters _ thus reducing the
time available for the parent to concentrate on any one child _
also reduced eventual educational attainment, Beller and Krein
found. Again, the effect was most pronounced among boys.
   Factors the researchers found to boost educational attainment
were higher family income, amount of reading materials in the home
and the mother's education. The father's education appeared to be a
factor among whites, but not blacks, they added.

<TEXT>
   Mike Tyson knocked out Michael Spinks
in the first round of a championship fight, retaining the
undisputed heavyweight crown in one of the shortest such bouts in
history.
   Tyson put Spinks on his back 1 minute, 31 seconds into the fight
with a crashing left and a right to the jaw.
   It was over before a sellout crowd of 21,785 really had a chance
to settle in. The gate of about $80 million was the richest in
boxing history, according to promoter Donald Trump.
   When he came around, Spinks, 31, said, ``I finally found someone
who can beat me.''
   It was the first defeat against 31 victories for Spinks, the
former undisputed light heavyweight champion and former
International Boxing Federation heavyweight champ.
   Tyson, who weighed 218\, six pounds more than Spinks, now has a
35-0 record with 31 knockouts. He turns 22 on Thursday.
   For his pain, Spinks got a guarantee of $13.5 million. Tyson's
cut from the fight, which was televised on closed-circuit and
pay-per-view television, would be in the neighborhood of $20
million.
   The only faster knockouts in heavyweight title history were Jim
Jeffries' 55-second victory over Jack Finnegin in 1900, Michael
Dokes' 1:03 win over Mike Weaver in 1982 and Tommy Burns' 1:28
defeat of Jem Roche in 1908.

<HEAD>Report Says EPA Hamstrung In Preventing Oil Spills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should consider rewriting regulations
to allow the Environmental Protection Agency a greater role in
safeguarding against oil spills, says a congressional report.
   The Congressional Research Service based its conclusions on a
study of the fuel spill that began on Jan. 2 at the Ashland Oil
Inc. terminal near Pittsburgh, and affected drinking water supplies
in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   CRS said in a 21-page analysis that Ashland complied with
federal standards in assuming responsibility for the cleanup of
more than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel from the Monongahela and
Ohio rivers.
   The problem, CRS said, appears to lie in loosely-written
regulations that make it difficult for the EPA to detect problems
before they occur. The research agency said it was only after the
collapse of an Ashland tank that EPA found faults with the
company's spill prevention plan.
   The fuel tank collapse at Ashland's Floreffe Terminal that
caused the contamination stemmed from a dime-sized flaw in the
tank's nearly 50-year-old steel wall.
   Ashland and other owners of above-ground oil tanks holding more
than 660 gallons are required to file oil spill prevention plans
which must be reviewed every three years. Ashland's plan was on
file near Pittsburgh, as required.
   But the government did not learn about alleged flaws in the plan
until after the accident. EPA said in a memorandum on Jan. 15 that
Ashland's Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures plan ``does
not adequately address spill prevention and control specific to the
facility.''
   ``Instead,'' the EPA said, ``it merely paraphrases the SPCC
regulations.''
   But Monday's report, requested by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.,
said the EPA never saw the plan before the accident because
regulations only require that the document be prepared, not that it
be inspected by EPA.
   Under the regulations, EPA only gets involved after spills have
occurred, unless it has reason to suspect problems.
   ``Minor spills should not be the only reason for an SPCC plan to
come before federal and state officials,'' CRS said in the report.
``More automatic review by EPA and state officials might be
desired, and perhaps the regulations should state this.''
   The EPA has been reviewing whether problems with Ashland's spill
prevention plan merit penalties.
   Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum said Monday that company believes
the plan met EPA regulations.
   ``We have not been fined and it's been our contention that we
had an adequate plan,'' he said.

<HEAD>Polls Shows Slight Majority Favors Talks with Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of Americans have a
negative view of Cuba's Marxist government, but slightly more than
half favor talks with Cuba on improving relations, according to a
poll released today.
   The survey showed that 81 percent of Americans have an
unfavorable attitude toward Cuba, compared with 52 percent in 1977.
Only 1 percent see Cuba in a ``very favorable'' light.
   But 51 percent would support the United States entering into
negotiations with Cuba looking toward re-establishing normal
diplomatic and economic relations. Thirty-one percent are opposed
to that policy.
   The survey was commissioned by Potomac Associates, an
independent policy research organization at Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies in Washington. The polling was
conducted by The Gallup Organization.
   It was carried out in March and involved interviews with 1,038
adult Americans. The survey has a margin of error of 4 percentage
points.
   Based on the survey, if either of the major party candidates
indicates a readiness to improve relations with Cuba, his standing
with the voters would benefit slightly.
   Eighteen percent said they would be more likely to vote for a
candidate with that policy, while 14 percent said they would be
less likely. Most said they would not be influenced either way by a
candidate's position on Cuba.
   The United States and Cuba have not had full diplomatic
relations since 1961, but agreed to establish small diplomatic
missions in each other's capital in 1977. A U.S. trade embargo
against Cuba has been in effect since 1960.
   U.S. talks with Cuba have been limited largely to immigration
issues in recent years. There have been no serious discussions on
such subjects as the economic embargo, Cuba's ties to the Soviet
Union or its military presence in such areas as Africa and Central
America.
   A separate section of the survey examined attitudes of
Cuban-Americans living in Florida and New Jersey. Ninety-six
percent feel that President Fidel Castro is a ``bad thing'' for
Cuba, but 41 percent said they would favor U.S.-Cuban talks on
normalizing relations. Forty-seven percent are opposed.
   The margin of error among the Cuban-Americans was 8 percentage
points to 9 percentage points.
   William Watts, president of Potomac Associates, said the
willingness of many Cuban-Americans to support bilateral talks
indicates that there is no basis for the widespread notion that the
exile community is inflexibly opposed to negotiations with Castro.
   Still, the survey showed hostility toward the Cuban government
among exiles is strong.
   Eighty-six percent believe the Soviet Union has ``very
important'' influence over Cuban government actions and 80 percent
have a ``very unfavorable'' perception of the human rights
situation in Cuba. Only 6 percent would support an easing of the
trade embargo against Cuba.
   The overwhelming majority also expressed support for Radio
Marti, the Voice of America broadcast operation to Cuba, and TV
Marti, the proposed U.S. government television channel for Cuba.
   The survey also included a sampling of 94 American opinion
leaders and policy makers. Of this group, 90 percent favored the
opening of negotiations with Cuba, but Watts said the group
interviewed was too small to be considered representative.

   Links with the United States will become even
more important for Australia as its Asian and Pacific neighbors
grow stronger and more prosperous, says Australia's defense
minister.
   Europe hasn't much part to play but the coming era of Pacific
growth ``assumes a very substantial American role which makes the
alliance with the United States all the more important,'' Minister
Kim Beazley said Monday.
   Beazley covered some of the strategy issues to be aired at the
annual ministerial meeting here Tuesday and Wednesday of ANZUS, the
military alliance created at the end of World War II by Australia,
New Zealand and the United States. New Zealand was ousted two years
ago over its ban on visits by nuclear-armed or powered U.S.
warships.
   Beazley said the door should be kept open for New Zealand's
return although he saw no immediate prospect for compromise in its
dispute with the United States.
   Instead of being overshadowed by a single country, the
Asia-Pacific area in the coming decades could become a region of
``many powers competing on an equal status ... some of them
economic giants, like we had in the Europe of the 19th Century,''
Beazley said. He named Japan, China and India.
   That vision of the future was not necessarily cause for ``any
sense of alarm,'' he said, since, the Asia-Pacific countries ``not
having land borders, by and large, are capable of civilized
behavior with each other, which was not possible for the European
powers of the 19th Century.''
   The Soviet Union had been increasing its military capability in
the region, but recently ``the United states has got its strategy
together quite dramatically ... in maritime terms in the Pacific,
and I think that has, to a degree, stabilized this issue,'' he said.
   While welcoming some of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policies, the West should press Moscow on such issues as the
massive Soviet presence at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, the Australian
defense minister said.
   Ending the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia is very much in the
Soviet Union's own interest and should be pursued diplomatically,
he added.

<HEAD>Testimony Reveals Widespread Leaks of Secret Pentagon Info</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-forgotten courtroom testimony reveals
that private defense consultants and contractors didn't need an
underground operation to obtain classified information from
Pentagon employees. They could get it simply by asking.
   The open-door system apparently operated alongside the
clandestine arrangements between consultants and Pentagon employees
that are the subject of an intensive federal investigation.
   Investigators believe consultants using the secret system may
have bribed Defense Department officials to obtain top-secret
information, including plans of one contractor that could be sold
to another.
   Tucked away in a court reporter's records in Baltimore is a 1984
description _ and a defense _ of the more open cooperation between
some consultants, contractors and Pentagon officials.
   The information obtained in the open was important to
contractors seeking to bid on Pentagon projects. But private
lawyers familiar with the system said the information usually was
secret rather than top secret, and only consisted of Pentagon
documents, not those of contractors.
   The up-front system came to light in January 1984, when lawyers
for a private defense consultant summoned Caroline A. Chewning to
the witness stand in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.
   Then and now involved with writing programs for the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, Ms. Chewning testified that
consultants and contractors with security clearances routinely
asked for key documents at offices such as hers _ which writes
``wish lists'' for futuristic military technology.
   Bribes were not necessary, she testified, because the
information was ``made available to them for free.''
   Why? Because, she testified, contractors could not possibly
submit a thorough bid for a major Pentagon project within the
required 45 days after an official notice was published.
   So officials simply handed out the information to
security-cleared consultants and contractors to give them a head
start.
   ``It's in the government's best interest that contractors have
this information. If they had to go to `official channels,' it may
take them six months. ... You're on a tight contract award basis,
and you don't have time for that,'' she said in defense of the
system.
   ``The government and private industry must cooperate in order to
get contracts awarded and material developed.''
   The Defense Department would not say Monday whether the system
has been changed. But in a speech, Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci cautioned against any hasty reforms of the defense
contracting system.
   While Carlucci said the government may terminate contracts found
to be tainted, he said ``the last thing we need now are hasty,
piecemeal changes that despite good intentions ultimately may make
matters worse.''
   Carlucci said ``no system can offer perfect protection against
the human factor. There is simply no way to devise a system that is
greed-proof.''
   The contracting system will undergo congressional scrutiny
Wednesday when the House Armed Services Committee holds the first
formal hearing on procurement practices since the fraud
investigation became public June 124.
   The first witness will be Robert Costello, undersecretary of
defense for acquisition policy.
   Also Monday, sources said 90 percent of the defense contractors
checked in a Pentagon study last year were sloppy in handling
classified documents, despite assurances given Congress by former
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger that the program had few
problems.
   The study was done by the Defense Investigative Service but was
withheld from Congress by Weinberger because he didn't like the
conclusions, according to the sources, speaking on condition they
not be named.
   The open system of giving documents to consultants was
apparently not widely discussed at the time Mrs. Chewning
testified. The witness recalled that her ``mouth fell open'' when a
contractor she had never met called to ask her for an
interpretation of a document she had written.
   In other developments, the FBI said it investigated Melvyn
Paisley prior to his 1981 confirmation by the Senate as assistant
Navy secretary for research, engineering and systems, but it would
not disclose the results of that check.
   Federal investigators found ``stacks'' of classified federal
documents that Paisley had no security clearance to possess when
they searched his home and office, The Washington Post reported in
today's editions, citing unidentified informed officials for the
information.
   And Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., asked Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci to investigate whether favorable treatment for the Sperry
Corp., now part of Unisys Corp., was arranged by Paisley for work
on the Navy's Aegis ship-defense system. The multibillion-dollar
system had been developed and had been almost exclusively outfitted
by the RCA Corp. at its facility in Moorestown, N.J., until work
was redistributed in 1986 to include Sperry.
   Ms. Chewning testified at the trial of William V. Miller, a
private defense consultant who was charged with two counts of
conversion and unauthorized sale of government property.
   Miller was acquitted, and his attorney, Selig Solomon, said in
an interview that Ms. Chewning's testimony likely won the case for
the defense. It showed that Miller was accused of taking material
that was given to consultants all the time, he said.
   Ms. Chewning said ``95 to 99 percent'' of the information that
consultants and contractors sought from her section was willingly
handed out.
   She said the documents went through a classification process,
first in her agency and then at the Pentagon, where the documents
were reviewed.
   Discussing the sensitivity of the documents, she said, ``You
just can't hand it to someone who doesn't have a security
clearance, just because they want to bid on it.''
   ``I have not seen them handled in an unsecure manner'' within
her office, she said.

   A congressman is asking the Pentagon to
investigate whether a key figure in the defense-purchasing probe
orchestrated a ``bewildering'' plan to share the work on a
lucrative weapons system.
   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., asked for an investigation of the
role played by former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn Paisley in a
1986 decision to redistribute work on the Navy's
multibillion-dollar Aegis ship-defense system.
   Florio, in a letter to Secretary Frank Carlucci, said Paisley _
a target of the ongoing defense procurement probe _ may have
orchestrated the plan to redistribute work on the highly technical
and massively expensive system.
   ``It is distressing to see that a decision that should have been
made in the best interests of national defense might have been made
for totally different reasons having to do more with greed,''
Florio said in a statement.
   He questioned a plan overseen by Paisley to designate the Sperry
Corp. of Great Neck, N.Y., as a ``second source'' for Aegis work.
The system, one of the Navy's most advanced, was developed and had
been almost exclusively outfitted by the RCA Corp. at its facility
in Moorestown, N.J.
   Before the proposal, Florio said, RCA had successfully built and
delivered 15 Aegis systems, at below contracted prices. Aegis,
named for the shield of the Greek god Zeus, combines radar,
computers and weapons in sophisticated, umbrella-like protection
for Navy warships.
   Florio said he was puzzled by the plan to shift some Aegis work
to Sperry given RCA's good performance. ``The rationale was, at
best, bewildering,'' Florio said in a letter to Carlucci.
   ``Many of us felt from the beginning that the decision to
second-source Aegis was questionable. Recent developments make it
appear even more so,'' Florio said.
   Florio said his concern was heightened by published reports
linking Paisley, now a private defense consultant, with the giant
Unisys Corp., formed by the 1986 merger of Sperry and Burroughs
Corp.
   A report in Defense News, published Monday, quotes sources as
linking Paisley to Unisys via his close associate, William Galvin,
a Unisys adviser also said to be under investigation.
   Paisley left government in March 1987 to form a consulting
business at a Watergate complex office near Galvin's.

<HEAD>Plane's Maker Says It Urged Complete Inspection Before Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. had urged Aloha Airlines to make a
``complete structural inspection'' of four aging jets just a few
months before the roof of one of the planes peeled off in flight,
federal investigators have been told.
   Boeing says that Aloha, after first agreeing to begin the
inspections in early 1988, postponed them until the end of the year
or possibly later.
   Only after a meeting in mid-April between Boeing and Aloha
officials did the airline agree to reinstate the stepped-up
maintenance program for its four oldest Boeing 737s including the
one that broke apart during flight on April 28, according to Boeing.
   The manufacturer's assertions were outlined in documents made
public Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board, which is
investigating the accident in which a flight attendant was swept to
her death after a 20-foot section of the plane's roof tore away.
   The plane then landed safely on the Hawaiian island of Maui.
   Aloha, in separate documents filed with the NTSB, denied that it
had delayed the stepped-up inspection and maintenance program.
   ``Boeing's continued reference to delaying the repair and
maintenance of the high-cycle airplanes is simply incorrect,'' the
airline declared.
   Earlier, Aloha had asked the NTSB not to make the Boeing
documents public.
   The claims and counterclaims are likely to be a major focus of
formal NTSB hearings next month in Seattle on the Aloha accident.
The Washington Post had disclosed the existence of some of the
Boeing documents last Sunday.
   In a summary of its dealings with Aloha since October, Boeing
maintained that it repeatedly warned the airline in letters and
informal discussions that its older aircraft _ especially the four
aging Boeing 737s _ had extensive corrosion that if not corrected
could make them unsafe.
   After inspecting two Aloha planes, a Boeing consultant called
them ``among the most corroded in the 737 fleet.''
   Boeing said its manager of maintenance, Robert Oldani, told
Aloha officials that the four oldest 737s might become unsafe if
the corrosion problem were not corrected. As a result, Aloha
promised to speed its maintenance program and begin a series of
structural inspections of the four oldest aircraft, Boeing said.
   But Boeing said it learned on March 3 that Aloha had changed its
mind and would postpone the heavy maintenance checks from the
spring to the last quarter of 1988. After a meeting between Boeing
and Aloha representatives on April 14, the airline agreed to
reinstate its earlier maintenance schedule, Boeing said.
   Maurice Myers, president of Aloha, has denied that Boeing ever
suggested that any of the Aloha jets was unsafe. He complained that
Boeing did not formally provide him with an evaluation of its
findings from last fall's inspections until April.
   But Boeing cited letters from its representatives on Oct. 15 and
Nov. 13 of last year as well as ``handwritten notes'' available to
Aloha that summarized its critical survey results.
   In the Oct. 15 letter to Aloha's vice president for quality
assurance and maintenance, Everette Webb, a Boeing consultant,
wrote that the importance of eliminating the corrosion from the
older Aloha jets ``cannot be overemphasized'' in light of the high
number of takeoffs and landings and the tropical environment in
which the airline operates.
   At the time, Webb asked that the Boeing team be allowed to
examine two additional aging Aloha aircraft, including the one that
five months later would break up during flight. The planes were
scheduled to undergo heavy maintenance in late October and early
November, according to Webb.
   The Boeing team, however, never examined the plane involved in
the April accident, although the other plane cited in the Oct. 15
letter was examined in late October, according to Boeing.
   On Nov. 13 after the second Aloha plane had been examined by the
Boeing team, Webb reminded Myers, the Aloha president, that Aloha
had three of the oldest Boeing 737s still flying and added, ``As
the fleet leader, the thoroughness and frequency of structural
inspections as well as the effectiveness of preventative
maintenance is important.''

<HEAD>US-Turkish Alliance Reiterated at State Dinner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House and the weather cooperated to
entertain Turkish President Kenan Evren in regal style at a starlit
state dinner, where President Reagan lauded ties with the NATO ally
as a ``solid structure'' for building peace and prosperity.
   Evren, the first Turkish president to make a state visit to the
United States in 21 years, responded with a toast at Monday's Rose
Garden event that praised Reagan for his efforts to lessen
superpower tensions and slash the threatening arsenal of nuclear
weapons.
   ``We support the efforts of your administration to seek better
relationships with the Soviet Union,'' said the Turkish president,
whose strategic nation borders on that country as well as Iran and
Iraq.
   In his brief toast, Reagan hailed recent improvements in the
U.S.-Turkish relationship. He said the 40-year history of bilateral
ties was built upon a ``solid structure'' and predicted it would
continue decades into the future.
   ``Our aspirations for our partnership remain large _ peace,
security and freedom for our peoples, close cooperation in securing
these objectives, and success in defending them,'' Reagan said.
   Turkey is the third largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel
and Egypt, primarily due to its strategic location and usefulness
as a listening post on the Soviet Union, the Middle East and the
Persian Gulf.
   Although strains have appeared in the relationship in recent
years over the level of U.S. aid to the strategic NATO ally, no
such problems were apparent at the elaborate state dinner.
   Usually, the black-tie events that are part of a formal state
visit occur inside the executive mansion. But tempted by the balmy
breezes that ended a heat spell and the clear moonlit skies, the
dinner featuring shrimp parfait, filet of lamb and coconut ice
cream was served in the torch-lit Rose Garden. Later, guests were
entertained under the stars by classical guitarist Christopher
Parkening.
   Earlier in the day, the two men met for 45 minutes after a
colorful fife and drum welcome was accorded the Turkish leader.
   A senior administration official said the two men engaged in a
``general review'' of the bilateral relations, and touched on
East-West relations and the Iran-Iraq War.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Reagan
took the opportunity ``to assure President Evren that we would
continue to work ... with Congress to give priority to our overall
security assistance program with Turkey.''
   The official said the Turkish president made no specific
economic requests and that his remarks carried ``the theme of
trade, not aid.''
   Congress approved $520 million in aid for Turkey last year _
almost all of it military assistance _ down from the $570 million
which the administration sought and the $1.2 billion that Turkey is
seeking to help modernize its defense forces.
   For fiscal 1989, starting next Oct. 1, the administration has
asked Congress to approve $620 million.
   The president said Americans ``have admired the way Turkey
pulled itself back to democracy when challenged by the violent
forces of terrorism and anarchy a year ago.''
   Evren, a retired army general, led a 1980 coup in Turkey that
helped restore public order after years of mounting violence by the
extreme right and left. Democratic civilian rule was restored in
1983 and voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, making
Evren president for a 7-year term.
   Reagan also praised growing U.S.-Turkish trade, calling it ``the
surest way that Turkey can find to ensure the prosperity its people
seek.''
   And in a symbolic move, Reagan presented Evren with the Legion
of Merit in gratitude for the contribution of the Turkish military
during the Korean War. The medal represents one of the highest
military honors America can bestow.

<HEAD>`Roger Rabbit' Burrows Into First; `Rambo' Blown Out Of Top 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' was bigger than
``Big,'' earning $11.2 million at the nation's box office last
weekend, while ``Rambo III'' got blown out of the top 10 in its
fifth week of release.
   The movie about a seedy detective played by Bob Hoskins who
comes to the aid of a cartoon rabbit set a record for a Walt
Disney-released film and easily beat the Tom Hanks comedy for first
place.
   ``Roger Rabbit'' opened Thursday. The Walt Disney Co. reported
the movie's five-day earnings at $14.8 million, surpassing
comparable five-day grosses for ``Three Men and a Baby'' at $13.9
million and ``Back To The Future'' at $14.7 million.
   ```Who Framed Roger Rabbit' appears to be an across-the-board
hit and we feel it is destined to join the ranks of the studio's
classics,'' said Dick Cook, president of distribution for Disney's
Buena Vista division.
   The Disney-Steven Spielberg collaboration was shown at 1,045
screens for its debut week and earned $10,742 per screen average.
   About $20 million more was expected from the sale of licensed
Roger Rabbit dolls, figurines, key rings, mugs, pencils and pens,
said Bob Solomon of Applause licensing company in Woodland Hills.
   ``Our impression is that the sales are phenomenal,'' Solomon
said Monday. ``We are also the licensor for the California Raisins,
and over this last week they have taken a back seat to Roger
Rabbit.''
   ``Rambo III,'' Sylvester Stallone's battle against the Soviets
in Afghanistan, earned $2 million for an 11th place spot, five
weeks after its release. The film, which reportedly cost $60
million to make, has so far earned $47.1 million.
   ``Big,'' which has steadily maintained the No. 2 position
despite wave after wave of new releases, earned $7.2 million, up 9
percent over its previous week. In third place was the Dan
Aykroyd-John Candy comedy ``The Great Outdoors,'' which earned
$6.12 million, while ``Red Heat'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Jim Belushi took fourth place with $6.11 million.
   ```Crocodile' Dundee II'' was fifth with $5.2 million, followed
by the baseball romance story ``Bull Durham,'' which remained in
sixth place for its second week with $5.1 million, but had a 9
percent business increase.
   ``Big Business'' was in seventh place with $4.1 million;
``Willow'' in eighth with $2.5 million; ``Funny Farm'' at No. 9
with $2.2 million; and ``The Presidio'' in 10th place with $2.1
million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release, and estimated production costs when available.

Paisley</HEAD>

   The former personnel director of the White
House says he recalls nothing unusual turning up in an FBI
background check of Melvyn Paisley, a key figure in the Pentagon
bribery probe.
   Mildred McGetrick, one of Paisley's three ex-wives, said she
told the FBI in mid-1981 that Paisley, then a Boeing Corp.
executives, was ``dishonest with money'' and also told federal
agents that Paisley took gratuities including cash and gifts.
   At the time, Paisley was under consideration by the White House
for the post of assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems.
   Ms. McGetrick, who was on a backpacking trip Monday and
unavailable for comment, was interviewed by the Los Angeles Times,
which published the story in its Sunday editions.
   In response, the FBI issued a statement saying the results of
its background investigation of Paisley were furnished to the White
House on Sept. 29, 1981. Paisley was nominated by President Reagan
less than a month later on Oct. 27 and confirmed by the Senate Nov.
23 of that year.
   FBI spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer said that in conducting background
checks, the bureau talks to ``as many people as we can to learn as
fully about the person as we can; if we know some enemies we talk
to them too.''
   She said the information _ derogatory or favorable _ is
forwarded to the requesting agency ``without comment or
recommendation.''
   Schnitzer refused to discuss the Paisley case, noting that
federal law prohibits the agency from disclosing details of its
background investigations.
   Former White House personnel director E. Pendleton James, who
approved Paisley for nomination, said the Paisley nomination came
in the ``crush of appointees'' during the first year of the Reagan
administration.
   He said he had no recollection of allegations of financial
dishonesty being made against Paisley.
   James said that ``FBI files were very closely held'' by the
office of White House counsel and that if derogatory information
that was found to be credible was raised in the background check
``then we would have a meeting on it, I would be briefed.''
   ``If there was such a meeting'' on Paisley, then the derogatory
information ``was not heavy enough because he was appointed,'' said
James.
   James also said that then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's
office generally ``did a pretty good job of ... wading in and
saying `we want X for this job.'''
   Weinberger has said he had only a ``very indirect'' recollection
of Paisley, pointing out that Paisley was a close friend of Navy
Secretary John Lehman, who had been a consultant at Boeing, where
Paisley worked.

<HEAD>Nureyev Celebrated at Paris Opera Ballet Gala</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rudolf Nureyev, the most celebrated ballet
dancer of his time, was honored at the Metropolitan Opera on Monday
for his 50th birthday by the Paris Opera Ballet, which he heads,
and colleagues from his past.
   Nureyev, who hasn't retired from performing, danced in one of
the ballets, ``Song of the Wayfarer.'' Metropolitan Opera soprano
Jessye Norman sang the Mahler song cycle from the orchestra pit and
James Levine conducted.
   Nureyev danced the lead role in 1971 when Maurice Bejart
choreographed ``Song of the Wayfarer.'' He was the wanderer and
Charles Jude the ``other self'' who dances calmly, reaching to him,
trying to lead him to peace.
   Nureyev _ his birthday was three months ago _ looked in splendid
shape and his dancing was effective.
   He acted through his dancing, as he always has done, and the
``presence'' that he projects from the stage has helped make him as
famous as two other great dancers of this century, Vaslav Nijinsky
and Anna Pavlova.
   In the opening dance, Harald Lander's ``Etudes,'' which moves
from ballet practice to all classical ballet technique, the company
looked beautifully schooled. Male stars Laurent Hilare and Manuel
Legris both showed dazzling technique but neither projected
personality.
   The finale was ``Le Grand Defile,'' which dates from 1946, a
processional by the entire company. It was being done for the first
time outside of Paris in Nureyev's honor.
   After the children of the company school and dancers came 11
stars announced by name. Then entered 26 people who have been part
of Nureyev's dance life _ including Miss Piggy, with whom Nureyev
danced on TV's ``The Muppets.''
   He walked in last, embraced each and received great applause
when he greeted Dame Margot Fonteyn, his famous partner with the
British Royal Ballet. When h greeted Mikhail Baryshnikov, the
latter lifted him off his feet.
   Nureyev was the first of the famous Russian dance defectors, in
1961, in Paris. He regularly appeared with the British Royal Ballet
from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s, danced free-lance after
that and has directed the Paris Opera Ballet since 1983.
   The evening included an American premiere, ``in the middle,
somewhat elevated,'' which William Forsythe choreographed for the
company a year ago. The company Forsythe heads, the Frankfurt
Ballet, performed here earlier in June and did more interesting
ballets than this one.
   Plotless modern ballet sequences were done for nearly half an
hour to music which sounded like a concrete-crushing machine.
Sylvie Guillem managed to look sexy during her solo. At the end,
there were many boos, covered by more cheers when the very fine
dancers bowed.
   Legris, scheduled for ``Etudes'' and ``in the middle, somewhat
elevated,'' also danced with Florence Clerc and Monique Loudieres
in a Marius Petipa pas de trois from ``Paquita'' because Jean-Yves
Lormeau was injured.
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch presented Nureyev with a crystal
apple, the symbol of New York, after the ``in the middle'' premiere.

neither government entity would say what their checks revealed.
Meanwhile, James Durst, who worked with Paisley at Boeing Co., told
the government in the early 1980s that Paisley had bragged of
committing a felony wiretapping operation and bribing people
overseas for military contracts and one of Paisley's ex-wives,
Mildred McGetrick, said she told the FBI in 1981 that Paisley took
gratuities and was ``dishonest with money.'' Paisley now is a

<HEAD>Nunn Says Vice Presidency `Not On Agenda;' Won't Provide
Background Info</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, who has been saying
he doesn't want to be on the Democratic ticket, hardened that
stance by declining to provide financial and other background
information Michael Dukakis campaign is seeking from prospective
running mates.
   Nunn said Monday in a telephone interview he has told Dukakis
he's not interested in the vice presidency, so it would be
inconsistent for him to make such background information available.
   ``He knows my position on the vice presidency,'' Nunn said.
``I've told him, I've told (Dukakis aide Paul) Brountas and others
that that was not on my agenda.''
   Brountas has been heading up the running mate search for Dukakis.
   Sources have identified Nunn as one of several prospective
running mates who have been asked to provide background information
to the Dukakis campaign.
   Nunn refused to confirm that he has been asked for such
information, citing confidentiality in his talks with the
nominee-apparent. But he said he has no plans to provide it.
   ``I'm not furnishing any,'' he said. ``I have not furnished
any.''
   He said, however, that he has a meeting set with Dukakis, who is
coming to Washington on Wednesday to meet with Democratic senators,
including some potential running mates.
   ``I plan to have a discussion with the governor ... on national
security or whatever else he wants to talk about, but I have no
plans to get into the financial information business or the medical
records or any of that stuff,'' Nunn said.
   The Georgia senator is chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   Dukakis said last week that if any of the prospective vice
presidential running mates ruled themselves out ``clearly and
unequivocally, to me, then obviously I'm not going to press the
point.''
   Dukakis made that comment after Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
announced through a spokesman that he was not interested in the job.

<HEAD>Dukakis Administration Seeks Confidentiality On Appraisal Figures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration of Gov. Michael Dukakis, in a
change of position, is asking the state attorney general's office
whether it may keep secret the appraised price of land for a state
prison.
   The selection of a prison site in the town of New Braintree is
under investigation by the FBI, and jail opponents and others have
sought to make the controversy an issue in Dukakis' presidential
campaign.
   The state Division of Capital Planning and Operations said
Monday it is awaiting an opinion from Attorney General James
Shannon on whether it can keep two appraisals of the prison site
confidential and divulge publicly only its offering price.
   The value of the property is a key issue to those accusing
Dukakis of favoring the two owners of the proposed prison site.
   Meanwhile, the co-owners of the property in question have hired
a prominent political consultant who has worked for Dukakis, the
likely Democratic nominee.
   And in another development, a Democrat-controlled legislative
committee refused Monday to investigate on its own of the site
selection.
   Last Thursday, the capital planning division's top official,
John Carlson, said of the appraisals: ``As soon as we can share
them with the owners, which is the way the law reads, we will of
course share them with the public.''
   Now the administration is seeking Shannon's opinion on reversing
that stance.
   Kathy Robertson, a spokeswoman for the division, said releasing
the appraised value of the property could harm the state if the
land deal winds up in court. A court case could result if the state
has to purchase the property using the eminent domain process.
   ``We're trying to make public everything we can and we're going
beyond what we would normally do in making everything public,''
Robertson said.
   New Braintree Selectman Dorothea Thomas-Vitrac attacked the
administration for its change of position.
   ``They have, in fact, by backpedaling, created a new
controversy,'' she said.
   The roughly 800 residents of New Braintree have been opposed to
the prison since the proposal first surfaced three years ago.
Questions surrounding the prison intensified when the owners of the
780-acre site offered to sell it to the state in 1986 for $9.5
million, a $6.5 million profit over what they paid a year earlier.
   A Norwood development firm headed by Daniel Striar and Gary
Jacobson owns the land. Jacobson grew up in the same neighborhood
as Dukakis and has been a contributor to Dukakis' political
campaigns.
   The state Legislature's Human Services Committee, in a close
vote, rejected a bipartisan proposal to probe the prison issue and
passed the entire matter to the Senate Ways and Means committee for
a decision.
   ``I see no evidence that there's any collusion, any conflict of
interest,'' said state Rep. Paul Kollios, co-chairman of the
committee.
   Striar and Jacobson have hired political consultant Michael
Goldman to help them respond to the barrage of national publicity
surrounding the land deal. Goldman worked in the Dukakis
administration during the governor's first term and has since
represented numerous prominent Massachusetts Democrats in political
campaigns, including opponents of Dukakis.
   ``The people who are going to want to see conspiracy are going
to see conspiracy everywhere,'' Goldman said.
   He said Striar and Jacobson were referred to him by a top aide
to state auditor Joseph DeNucci, a close ally of Dukakis. DeNucci
is the former co-chairman of the Legislature's Human Services
committee, which deals with prison issues.
   Thomas-Vitrac said the hiring of a political consultant
``indicates to me that they on their own would have problems
justifying their position and they would have to have people come
in and put a spin on things.''

Act</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley is
holding out the threat of a presidential veto if Congress tries to
tamper with the 1980 law that deregulated the railroad industry.
   But Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., continued to push a bill
doing just that, in anticipation of a meeting today by the Senate
Commerce Committee to act on the measure.
   Congressional and administration aides said Rockefeller was
negotiating with several railroads Monday to try to win their
support.
   The legislation would amend the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 to aid
shippers of coal, grain and other commodities who contend they are
being gouged by railroad monopolies.
   Burnley's message was in the form of a letter written to key
members of the Senate panel on Monday.
   He said in the letter that Rockefeller's measure ``would erode
the substantial gains achieved under the Staggers Act. The
president's senior advisers would recommend a veto of (the
legislation) or a bill resembling this bill if it were presented to
the president for his signature.''
   Many railroads have opposed altering the Staggers Act, which
they say gave them needed pricing and service flexibility to better
compete with trucks. Congress enacted the 1980 law to give Conrail
and other railroads incentives to rebuild failing and antiquated
systems.
   But a coalition of shippers has said the Interstate Commerce
Commission, in its interpretation of Staggers, has failed to
protect shippers, especially those dependent on a single railroad
to transport their wares.
   A key provision of the bill would force the ICC to periodically
adjust its cost index to reflect productivity gains by railroads.
The ICC uses the index to determine how much freight railroads can
increase their rates each quarter to keep up with inflation.
Shippers contend the formula does not account for gains railroads
have made to make them more efficient.
   Burnley sent his letter to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; and to Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., the
panel's ranking Republican.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is urging

no way to devise a system that is greed-proof.''
   ``The last thing we need now are hasty, piecemeal changes that
despite good intentions ultimately may make matters worse,''
Carlucci said in a speech Monday at the National Press Club.
   ``I urge those who are ready now to condemn and abandon our
entire procurement system to withhold judgment until the facts are
in, and to keep in mind that no system can offer perfect protection
against the human factor,'' he said. ``There is simply no way to
devise a system that is greed-proof.''
   Carlucci also said that former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
and Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard will help him determine
``whether additional changes in the procurement system are in
order'' after the facts are in.
   As many as 100 military contracts may be been tainted because
Pentagon officials and private consultants allegedly provided
classified information to defense contractors to help them bid for
lucrative contracts, according the U.S. attorney coordinating the
case, Henry Hudson.
   Carlucci did urge changes in the way Congress allocates money
for weapons procurement.
   In testimony on Capitol Hill, Carlucci said, he had ``advocated
further reforms. I have said I would sign up for large savings, in
the billions of dollars, if we could put the budgeting and
programming process on a stable course.''

   Here is a look at the main issues of the 19th
Communist Party conference opening today, as expressed in theses
approved by the policy-making party Central Committee:
   Freer Interparty Debate _ The theses call for freeing political
discussions from previous restrictions as long as they do not lead
to confrontation or disunity. They call for the rehabilitation of
innocent victims of Josef Stalin's purges.
   Economy _ The Central Committee's program urges greater effort
to meet consumer demand, and says that failure to do so is
``especially intolerable.''
   Science and Technology _ An acceleration of progress in science
and technology is crucial to economic progress and therefore to
social renewal of Soviet society, the program says.
   The Communisty Party's Place in Soviet Society _ Party officials
have weakened the economy, government, and the party itself by
interfering in decisions of government councils and economic
managers, according to the report. Party officials should be
limited to two five-year terms of office.
   Government Reform _ Soviets, or government councils, from the
local level to the national Supreme Soviet must be strengthened to
take on responsibility that the party has usurped, the theses
state. Party officials must learn to obey the law and the Soviet
Constitution.
   Ethnic Unrest _ The report says the Soviet Union has done much
to ensure that the country's more than 100 ethnic groups get along.
But it says the issue requires constant attention and that disputes
will be settled on the basis of ``genuine democracy.''
   Legal and Judicial Reform _ Reforms of the legal and judicial
systems must ensure individual rights and the rule of law rather
than the rule of individual leaders, the Central Committee says.
   Social Organizations _ Groups such as unions, the Young
Communist League, cooperatives and others should be given more
power to initiate legislation and cooperate with government to
solve social problems, the report says.
   External Affairs _ The report says foreign policy in the past
too often emphasized military rather than political responses, and
that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies take into account the
realities of the nuclear age.

   Attorney Anthony Smith was delivering
closing arguments in court when a strong earthquake shook a
160-mile stretch of coastal Northern California, swaying
skyscapers, shattering glass and dumping store shelves.
   ``As you can see, my argument is reaching the powers that be,''
Smith deadpanned Monday, according to his associate, Reid Dworkin,
who said spectators ran out of the courtroom and the judge briefly
recessed the trial.
   The temblor, the second to rock the state in two days,
registered about 5.7 on the Richter scale, according to University
of California seismologists.
   No injuries or serious damage was reported.
   Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park, said the epicenter of the 11:43 a.m. quake was 16 miles
south of San Jose, near Loma Prieta Mountain on the San Andreas
Fault.
   The quake was one of the strongest in the San Francisco Bay area
on the San Andreas Fault since the ``Great Earthquake'' of 1906,
said Robert Uhrhammer at the University of California Seismographic
Stations at Berkeley. That quake, which started fires that
destroyed much of the city, had an estimated magnitude of 8.3 on
the Richter scale, which had not yet been devised.
   The 650-mile-long San Andreas Fault annually produces dozens of
quakes.
   A quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage, while a
magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage.
   Most people in quake-prone Northern California took the shaking
in stride, but others found it unnerving.
   On the 17th floor of the Federal Building, Oakland Hells Angels
member James ``Fuzzy'' Neal said there was ``a little bit of
panic'' in a courtroom where a drug trial was under way.
   ``It's bad enough being in a two-story house when one goes off.
I knew I couldn't run down the steps and get out,'' Neal said.
   But Ginger Johnson, a receptionist for Montgomery Securities on
the 21st floor of the landmark Transamerica building, said workers
were so unconcerned that ``our traders immediately started betting
on how big it was.'' The 48-floor pyramid-shaped tower was built to
withstand far more powerful temblors.
   In Sunnyvale, 40 miles to the south, chunks of cement fell from
the ceiling of a parking garage.
   At the Holy City Art Glass shop near the epicenter and just 100
yards from the San Andreas Fault, sheets of glass flew off racks
and stained glass windows leaning against a wall toppled and broke,
causing about $400 in damage, said artist Tom Stanton.
   Groceries at a 7-Eleven at Scotts Valley fell off shelves and
customers ``were thrown up against the outside wall,'' said clerk
Judy Young. Damage also was reported at a nearby supermarket.
   On Sunday, an earthquake measuring 4.5 to 4.7 on the Richter
scale shook a wide area of Southern California, including downtown
Los Angeles, but no serious damage was reported. At least four
people were treated for minor injuries.
   Monday's quake was felt as far north as Santa Rosa, about 60
miles north of San Francisco, and to the south about 100 miles away
on the Monterey Peninsula. Although Berkeley scientists upgraded
their magnitude from an earlier reading of about 5.0, other
agencies stuck to a lower estimate.
   The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., estimated the magnitude at 5.0, as did the
survey's Menlo Park office.
   Estimates differ because the earthquake information center based
its estimate on body waves generated by the quake, while the
Seismographic Stations' figure is based on measurement of surface
waves, Jacobs said.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake,
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Each
increase of one number means the ground motion was 10 times greater.

<HEAD>Women's Club Charged With Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Woman's National Democratic
Club will vote Wednesday on allowing its 85 male members to vote or
hold office, and the club's president says the governing board has
recommended approval.
   The 66-year-old club was the target Monday of a discrimination
complaint filed by George Washington University law professor John
F. Banzhaf III.
   His complaint was filed with the District of Columbia's Office
of Human Rights ``to encourage the vote'' to give the club's male
members the same status in the organization as its 1,815 women
members, Banzhaf said.
   Jean Jenson, the club's president, said she was surprised to
learn about Banzhaf's complaint because ``we have had absolutely no
contact with him at all.''
   If Banzhaf had contacted the group, he would have learned the
club's governing board has already recommended approval of the
proposed change in the by-laws, Jenson said.
   ``We were kind of amazed he didn't do his homework on this,''
she said.
   The complaint follows separate decisions this month by the
capital's last all-male clubs _ the Cosmos Club and the
Metropolitan Club _ to admit women.
   Banzhaf had also filed a complaint against the Cosmos Club and
said he will ask city authorities to make sure the group's decision
to admit women goes beyond mere tokenism.
   Jenson said men have been club members since the 1930s. ``Men
have never indicated an interest in holding office here because
this is a volunteer organization,'' she said.
   Under D.C. law, a discrimination complaint is investigated by
the Office of Human Rights to determine if there is probable cause
to submit it to the D.C. Human Rights Commission. The law calls for
attempts at conciliation between the parties before a complaint is
sent to the commission.
   As a party to the Cosmos Club complaint, Banzhaf said he will
push for either an affirmative action program for admitting women
or the long-term monitoring of the club's membership policies.

<HEAD>NIH Employee Infected With AIDS Virus In Laboratory Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Institutes of Health employee was
infected with the deadly AIDS virus at work despite taking
recommended precautions, according to a published report today.
   The Washington Post reported that the NIH employee became
infected despite wearing gloves and following recommended
procedures.
   NIH officials said the employee was infected when a vial filled
with AIDS-infected blood broke in the worker's hand.
   Officials said the accident occurred a few weeks ago, and one
NIH scientist said the accident involved a safety device that is
supposed to reduce the risk of just the kind of accident that
occurred.
   ``It's there so this type of thing won't happen,'' the scientist
told the Post.
   There have been two similar incidents involving workers at
laboratories associated with NIH, but officials said this is the
first accident involving an NIH employee.
   Officials said the employee, who still works at NIH, was
diagnosed as being infected with the virus by the Clinical Center
at NIH on Monday afternoon and is receiving medical treatment. The
newspaper said officials declined to discuss specifics of the
accident and requested the employee's gender and job title be
withheld.
   Other NIH employees were informed about the accident Monday.
   Recent figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control
indicate the rate of accidental infection with the AIDS virus among
health care workers is only a fraction of 1 percent, with only 15
documented cases following accidents involving contamination from
needles or broken glass.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, attacks the body's
immune system. No one is known to have recovered from the illness.

<HEAD>U.S. Bishops Decide To Formulate New Paper On AIDS Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops
decided to revamp their stand on fighting AIDS to quell a division
within the church, but stopped short of condemning a paper that
tolerates teaching about condoms.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops concluded Monday by
unanimously approving a decision to appoint a committee to draft a
new AIDS paper. The updated document would be drawn in closer
consultation with the Vatican and acceptable to the entire
conference, church leaders said after a closed session at St.
John's University.
   ``The division among ourselves, the teachers, is reflected among
the people,'' said a statement released by Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin of Chicago, who made the motion for the new paper. ``We
cannot allow it to continue festering. Our unity must be restored
so we can get on with our business.''
   ``The Many Faces of AIDS _ A Gospel Approach'' was approved by
the conference's administrative board and released last December
but stirred controversy with the portion about condoms.
   While stressing abstinence from sex outside marriage and
fidelity within marriage, the statement noted that many in society
reject church teachings on sexuality and said education programs
could include ``accurate information about prophylactic devices''
as a means of preventing transmission of the deadly disease.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread mainly by the
exchange of blood or semen during sexual contact or by intravenous
drug use.
   A Vatican official charged the authors with causing confusion in
the church, which objects to birth control.
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith, also chastised the administrative board
that approved the paper for not consulting with the Vatican.
   Bernardin told the news conference that when the administrative
board approved the ``Many Faces'' paper, ``we sincerely felt it was
based on sound theology.
   ``Now some questions have risen whether the document does have
some ambiguities. Those points have to be discussed,'' he said.
   Bernardin said the new policy paper can ``put to rest any doubts
which might exist regarding the church's teaching on sexuality and
how that teaching applies to the current crisis.''
   But conference leaders did not retract the paper as some critics
urged. Rather, they said it should be a foundation for the
still-to-be appointed authors of the new paper.
   ``We're not replacing it. The first document stands,'' said
Archbishop John May of St. Louis. ``This new document will be a
document of the whole conference, all the bishops together.''
   An outright scrapping of the paper, Bernardin said, also would
have sowed dissension among bishops.
   ``Withdrawal could give the impression that the entire document
is flawed and that the entire administrative board was in serious
error,'' he said. ``Such action could reopen the debate with
greater intensity.''
   May apologized for the administrative board's ``mistake'' in
releasing the AIDS document before the full conference of roughly
300 bishops could review it.
   On the other hand, he said, ``Many bishops were clamoring for
something to use in their general communities.''
   May said he hoped a new policy could be drafted for
consideration at the next conference, to be held in November in
Washington, D.C. He said some of the authors of the first paper
might be appointed to work on the second.
   In previous business at the four-day conference, the bishops
approved a a report about the morality of U.S. nuclear policy,
opposing arms build-ups but stopping short of taking a strong stand
on disarmament. The bishops also said they didn't think it was
morally wrong to pursue research on the ``Star Wars'' defense
initiative, but said they couldn't endorse deploying such a system.
   The bishops also approved a campaign to raise $20 million to
help orders support their retired members.

<HEAD>Americans Warned of Poisoning Danger From Imported Ceramic Ware</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seemingly safe ceramic ware commonly used at
dinner tables, particularly plates and pots from abroad, may
threaten owners with deadly lead poisoning and authorities can do
little to check the hazard, federal officials told Congress.
   Frank E. Young, head of the Food and Drug Administration, told a
congressional hearing on Monday that despite stepped-up efforts,
the agency can never check each shipment of ceramics and is not
authorized to inspect foreign products.
   ``The thousands of trucks and automobiles crossing the border
simply cannot be effectively inspected or their cargos tested for
lead,'' said Young.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who chaired the hearing of the oversight
and investigations panel of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, said there are ``serious deficiencies'' in the FDA's
efforts to control ceramic ware.
   However, Wyden said a major part of the hearing was educational.
``Without adequate education about this problem, many individuals
will continue to purchase dangerous items for food service,'' he
said.

   Some 2,700 opponents of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini marched to the White House to mark the seventh anniversary
of their group's expulsion from Iran and to celebrate a recent

   Two members of Congress addressed the rally Monday, comparing

   ``There is no question in my mind yours is a just cause,'' said
Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., a member of the House Foreign

   This summer's drought will mean more hamburger
on the plates of children in public schools in the fall.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday the government
has will spend at additional $50 million to buy surplus ground beef
and donate it to schools and other institutions.
   Drought has reduced forage supplies and has forced more cows
onto the market, depressing prices. According to department
figures, Utility-grade cows sold for $50 per 100 pounds of live
weight in May, and by mid-June were bringing $37.50.
   In 1986-87, USDA spent $113 million for 115 million pounds of
frozen ground beef for donation to schools.

<TEXT>
   A commuter train whose brakes apparently failed
slammed into another train at an underground platform of a busy
Paris station, killing at least 37 people and injuring 32,
officials said.
   It was the worst train accident ever in the capital, authorities
said. The death toll was expected to mount to 40 once all the
bodies were removed from the twisted wreckage.
   Officials said the eight-car commuter train, coming from the
southeastern suburb of Melun, rammed into the front of a four-car
train that was preparing to leave an underground terminus at the
Gare de Lyon station in eastern Paris.
   Philippe Rouvillois, president of the railroad authority, known
as the SNCF, said the moving train had a ``braking problem'' and
its driver alerted passengers to move to the rear.
   ``When the driver noticed a problem with the brakes, he asked
travelers in the train to move toward the back,'' Rouvillois said.
   He said the train went about 500-600 yards past a red light as
it was approaching the Gare de Lyon, one of the busiest train
stations in Paris. The Gare de Lyon is a stop for the city's
subways and handles commuter traffic as well as intercity trains.
   An unknown number of bodies remained inside the wreckage. Fire
officials said they thought all survivers had been removed. It was
not immediately known if any Americans were among the victims.
   At least 15 people were seriously injured, officials said.
   Passengers in shock wandered through the station or sat on the
platform beside the twisted wreckage.
   About 250 rescue workers struggled through the night, sawing
through the tangle of metal looking for more survivors. Forty fire
engines, 15 ambulances and a helicopter were at the station.
   Police said it would be several hours before the last bodies
were freed. They said both trains were crowded with commuters when
the accident occurred at 7:10 p.m. (1:10 p.m. EDT) but the total
number of passengers was not known.
   Rescuers pulled the first body from one of the cars about two
hours after the accident. Witnesses said the impact of the speeding
train hitting the one parked on the tracks forced the cars of the
first train into and on top of one another.
   The French news agency, Agence France-Presse, quoted railway
authority officials as saying the inbound train was moving at 45 to
50 mph when it entered the station.
   In addition, train authority officials said the train leaving
Paris was several minutes behind schedule.
   The state prosecutor for Paris, Michel Raynaud, opened an
investigation into the cause of the accident.
   Police cordoned off the area, but from an adjacent platform it
was possible to see the twisted wreckage and the emergency medical
center set up to treat the injured.
   Authorities said the cause of the accident had not been
determined. Officials of the state-owned railroad Societe Nationale
Chemin de Fer said the moving train might have entered the
underground track too fast and been unable to stop.
   Patrick Michelin, director of the Gare de Lyon, said the
arriving eight-car train may have had brake trouble.
   ``It looks like we have a problem with brakes and we have to
find out the origin of it,'' he said.
   Transport Minister Louis Mermaz, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris
and police chief Jean Paolini went to the station to oversee the
rescue and preliminary investigation.
   On the platform beside the tangled steel, medical workers cared
for a dozen injured passengers. Some lay on stretchers, bleeding
badly. A sheet covered a child's body.
   The conducter of the stationary train, who was not injured,
said: ``All at once I saw the train coming toward me at high speed
and I had just enough time to jump onto the platform.''
   A person who saw the accident from the platform said: ``The
shock was extremely violent and the noise was enormous and
resounding. I was on the platform when I saw the train arrive,
running at what seemed to be an extremely high speed.
   ``I told myself, `It isn't possible; it will stop.' But it
smashed into the other that was parked. Two cars were completely
flattened. On the platform, people began to panic and then run in
all directions.''
   Raoul Viger, commanding the fire brigades, said the rescue task
was difficult because, ``to get to the living trapped in the cars,
we have to crawl over dead bodies.''
   As news of the accident spread, hundreds of people arrived at
the station looking for family members and friends, police said.

   The dollar dropped below the 131-yen level in
foreign exchange trading in Tokyo on Tuesday, while stock prices
fell marginally.
   The dollar opened at 130.48 yen, down from Monday's close of
131.70. It mainly fluctuated between a low of 130.38 and a high of
131.25 before finishing the day at 130.95.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 121.20-point loser Monday, shed another 36.92
points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 27,398.09 points.
   Shunsuke Kato, a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, said local
investors sold the dollar in early morning trading following an
overnight decline in New York, which he said was ``triggered by
intervention on the part of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.''
   The move ``gave us the impression that there would be a limit on
the dollar's rise,'' Kato said.
   One analyst at a major local securities firm, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday's early drop in the dollar was
only a slight correction. He said the currency's rise above the
131.00-yen level in the past week was too fast, adding that
``dealers are more likely to buy the currency in the mid-130 yen
point.''
   The analyst predicted the dollar would continue to gain ground
against the yen this week, and said ``dealers will probably test
even the 135.00-yen level because the Bank of Japan has said it
will not intervene.''
   However, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on Tuesday told a
regular news conference that the recent dollar rise was ordinary
fluctuation, and said the central bank will step into the market if
necessary.
   The Monday dollar closing capped a six-day winning streak during
which the currency rose by a total of 4.82 yen. It was the highest
finish for the dollar since Dec. 10, when it closed at 132.18 yen.

<HEAD>U.S. Protests Arab Country's Acquisition of Stinger Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has formally protested
Qatar's refusal to hand over U.S.-made Stinger missiles the Arab
nation bought on the black market.
   A State Department official said Monday that Assistant Secretary
Richard W. Murphy raised the issue with the defense minister of
Qatar last weekend at a meeting in the Persian Gulf sheikdom's
capital of Doha.
   Murphy, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and
South Asian Affairs, demanded the Stingers be returned to the
United States, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``They have them. They got them from some place and we want them
back,'' the official said.
   Murphy also reiterated the United States' demand for access to
the missiles to determine through their serial numbers who had sold
them to Qatar, the department official said.
   The United States prohibits other governments in its Stinger
contracts from transferring the weapons to a third party.
   The New York Times reported today that the defense minister,
Crown Prince Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, rejected Murphy's demands
on the grounds that Qatar needed the missiles to defend itself
against threats to its security.
   The United States learned Qatar had Stinger missiles in March,
when U.S. Embassy officials in Bahrain noticed one in a military
parade in Qatar. When confronted, officials in Doha admitted they
had secretly bought 12 missiles, but refused to identify the
source, according to the Times.
   In May, Murphy said the highly accurate, shoulder-fired rockets
may have been passed to Qatar by Iran, which in turn obtained them
from the U.S.-supplied Afghan rebels.
   Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved language
to prohibit any military dealings with Qatar until the Stingers
were returned. State department officials told the Times the United
States has no plans to recall its ambassador over the disagreement.
   Qatar does not buy any weapons nor does it receive any military
or economic aid from Washington, but it has traditionally sought
good relations with the United States.

   Members of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ruling Politburo
engage in arguments during their closed-door meetings that
sometimes render the body deadlocked, the editor-in-chief of the
party daily Pravda says.
   The editor, Viktor G. Afanasyev, was one of two Communist Party
insiders to shine the light of glasnost on the Politburo, offering
a rare glimpse of the privileges and rigors that come with
membership in the inner circle.
   Also discussing the party's pinnacle with foreign reporters
Monday was Igor Shvets, an official on its policy-making Central
Committee.
   He acknowledged that Politburo members earn more than four times
the average factory worker's pay, saying they don't stand in line
for potatoes because ``they are always on duty.''
   Despite Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' which has opened
many facets of Soviet society to scrutiny, little is known about
how the country's supreme political institution functions.
   The Politburo customarily issues a laconic statement following
its regular Thursday meetings, but it never provides a detailed
account.
   Afanasyev said he has attended Politburo meetings under both
Gorbachev and the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev. He said
Gorbachev's Politburo bears little relationship to Brezhnev's,
whose members ``would talk for an hour, and they'd rubber stamp the
decision, and that was that.''
   The editor disclosed that after the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant explosion in April 1986, the Politburo met in emergency
session for 1{ days to discuss the crisis.
   ``There aren't any basic controversies or contradictions up
there,'' Afanasyev said of the Politburo. ``The need for
perestroika is not being questioned. ... But there is argument;
there is discussion, there is sometimes heated discussion. There's
been a lot of protracted argument sometimes.''
   Shvets suggested crisis management is not unusual for the
Kremlin's top leadership. ``There is no day or night for them,'' he
said. ``They are always on duty.''
   Dissenting views among members of the Politburo and of the
party's second-most powerful institution, the Secretariat, have
sometimes left the groups deadlocked, Afanasyev said.
   ``Sometimes a session of the Politburo or Secretariat cannot
resolve the issue in its entirety because there are different
opinions,'' he said. ``Then the question is looked into in greater
depth, and only after it's analyzed in all its aspects is the final
decision taken.''
   Alluding to reports that Politburo members enjoy access to
special stores that carry commodities not generally available in
this country and that they have hard-to-find foodstuffs delivered
to their homes, Shvets added, ``It wouldn't make sense to have them
stand in line for potatoes.''
   However, he insisted, ``They have no special privileges. The
only privileges they have are related to their protection,'' he
said, citing secluded country retreats known as dachas as an
example.
   Shvets said the perquisites of Politburo members did not change
when Gorbachev's came to power in March 1985.
   He also said they earn about the same as a government minister,
$1,350 to $1,700 a month. A typical Soviet factory worker makes
about $340 a month.
   Afanasyev said there is a formal 10- to 15-minute limit on how
long each Politburo member can have the floor, but that members
often get around the rule by seeking the floor several times.
   He denied the Politburo is split into camps with some members
following Gorbachev and others siding with Yegor K. Ligachev, the
Kremlin's No. 2, who is seen as a conservative force in the ruling
body.
   He did say, however, that members display different outlooks
depending on whether they are career Communist Party officials like
Gorbachev or technocrats, people who rose from the ranks of
administration or plant management.
   Some people, he said, reached the Politburo or the Secretariat,
which runs the party and nation from day to day, ``from what you
might call the technocracy. Others have been party functionaries
all their lives, and of course, the way various questions are
discussed, the inflections, if you will, will be different.
   ``This is the only area where I see a divergence of opinion, but
not on political issues.''
   Afanasyev did not say which party leaders he was referring to
when he mentioned technocrats, but under Gorbachev, many men with a
strong background in economic management, including Premier Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov, a former factory director, have assumed top
responsibilities in the party and government.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. military attache to Greece was
killed Tuesday by a car bomb that blew his armor-plated automobile
off the small side street where he lives, officials said.
   A police spokesman, who requested anonymity, identified the
victim as Navy Capt. William Nordine. Neighbors said he apparently
was driving to work.
   A Pentagon spokesman in Washington, Maj. Alan Frietag, did not
release an identity, but said the senior military officer assigned
to the U.S. embassy in Athens, a Navy captain, was killed in a bomb
blast near his home.
   The explosion occurred at 8:06 a.m. (1:06 a.m. EDT) in the
Kefalari district of the northern Athens suburb of Kifissia, where
many American and foreign diplomats live.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   The bomb had been placed in the trunk of a parked car and the
force of the explosion decapitated Nordine and sent him through a
side window of his car, police said.
   They said the explosion lodged the officer's car in a steel
fence across the street.
   U.S. embassy officials on the scene refused to comment, but
people living in the neighborhood said Nordine was apparently
driving to work.
   ``He lived up the street with his wife and children. He drove to
work around this time every day,'' said a person living nearby,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The booby-trapped car was destroyed in the blast, which was felt
for miles around the area, shattering windows in surrounding homes.
   Frietag said that at about 1:15 a.m. EDT ``a bomb exploded near
the home of the U.S. defense attache. He was in a car and the bomb
exploded outside the car. He was killed in the explosion.''

<HEAD>Michigan First To Attach Criminal Sanctions To Surrogate Parenting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Middlemen who profit from surrogate births
risk up to five years in prison and $50,000 in fines under a law
that makes Michigan the first state to attach criminal sanctions to
pregnancy-for-pay deals.
   Gov. James Blanchard on Monday signed into law a bill that makes
arranging such deals a felony beginning Sept. 1. Advertising or
otherwise ``inducing'' a woman to become a surrogate also will be a
felony.
   ``It's a major victory,'' Jeremy Rifkin, co-chair of the
National Coalition Against Surrogacy, said in Washington.
   ``Michigan will be leading the way with this legislation,'' said
state Sen. Connie Binsfeld, leader of a five-year drive to outlaw
surrogacy.
   ``I believe the Legislature and the governor have carried out a
very strong moral obligation to protect children from becoming
commodities under commercial contracts,'' said the Republican
senator.
   The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Michigan chapter said he was contemplating a legal challenge
against the law.
   ``It's hard to understand how a governor who's pro-choice would
criminalize the process when a surrogate mother and a couple wish
to bring life into this world,'' said Howard Simon.
   In announcing his decision, the Democratic governor said he
signed the law despite reservations because he believed it was
better than none at all.
   ``By taking the profit out of childbirth, it stands firm against
the buying and selling of human life,'' he said.
   Also under the law, those who contract for a birth and women who
agree to bear a child for money will risk misdemeanor penalties of
up to 90 days in jail and a $10,000 fine.
   Typically, infertile couples pay $10,000 to be matched with a
would-be mother. They pay another $10,000 to the woman who agrees
to be artifically inseminated, carry the child, then give up
custody. They also pay for the hospital bills and pregnancy-related
expenses.
   The law would still allow a woman who wants to bear a child and
then give up the baby to another couple to do so, while having
pregnancy-related bills paid. But the mother could get no fee and
any middleman would have to work for free.
   The law doesn't address the legality for a Michigan couple to
sign a contract in another state and carry out the agreement in
Michigan, said Noel Keane, a Dearborn attorney, who has arranged
228 surrogate births, including New Jersey's ``Baby M.''
   ``Maybe the arrangement of a contract could be anywhere outside
Michigan, and the insemination, the birth, the payment, everything
else take place inside Michigan,'' said Keane.
   Keane said a constitutional challenge probably would be based on
a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing as part of the
right to privacy the right to beget children without unwarranted
governmental intrusion.
   The mother of ``Baby M,'' Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, sued Keane
when she decided to keep her child. She won an out-of-court
settlement for an amount reported at between $30,000 and $40,000.
   But in a landmark custody battle over the girl she bore under a
$10,000 contract, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould won only visitation rights.
On Feb. 3, the New Jersey Supreme Court granted custody of the
2-year-old girl, now legally known as Melissa, to the child's
father, William Stern.
   The court, in overturning part of a lower court ruling, also
outlawed surrogacy for pay and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
parental rights to the child.
   Michigan is the first state to attach criminal penalties to
surrogate-parent contracts, but not the first to address the issue.
   Kentucky and Louisiana have enacted laws declaring such
contracts illegal, but don't impose criminal penalties. Nebraska
doesn't recognize the legal validity of surrogate-parenting
contracts. Indiana has put enforcement of such arrangements on hold
while the issue is researched, and proposed regulations were vetoed
in Arkansas.
   Harold Cassidy, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, said states
generally have not have not enforced those statutes ``out of
apparent confusion as to whether such enforcement would represent
the will of the people,'' he said.
   He said many states will follow Michigan's lead, and
``prosecutors will no longer have a choice'' in bringing charges
against surrogacy brokers.

<TEXT>
   It took just 91 seconds for boxing
champion Michael Tyson to knock out Michael Spinks, but it took 47
minutes to introduce all the celebrities at ringside.
   Talk about a sideshow.
   Actor Sean Penn reportedly slammed a TV cameraman into an
elevator door.
   Frank Sinatra rubbed elbows with actors Don Johnson, Chuck
Norris and Bruce Willis. Young actors Matthew Broderick and Judd
Nelson drew adoring screams from young fans in the crowd.
   Comedians Richard Pryor and David Brenner mingled with singers
Natalie Cole and Sheena Easton at the Convention Center.
   Boxing legends were plentiful Monday night, including Joe
Frazier, Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvelous Marvin Hagler. Muhammad
Ali received the longest standing ovation of any celebrity
introduced under the hot lights.
   But Tyson's wife, actress Robin Givens, was booed, probably in
response to reports that the marriage was on the shakes. But top
``hate award'' honors went to New York Yankees' principal owner
George Steinbrenner, who was booed so loudly that ring announcer
Michael Butler had to hesitate a minute before continuing the
``beautiful people'' roll call.
   The host of the extravaganza, Donald Trump, and his wife, Ivana,
chose to sit next to a presidential candidate, Jesse Jackson. In
the hubbub, secret service agents pushed and shoved to form a human
chain around the Democratic hopeful.
   At a prefight cocktail party, Trump toasted his celebrity guests
with champagne and fancy foods. In what seemed worlds away, fans
who truly cared about the fight's outcome took the day off from
work and paid $300 each for their rafter seats, enjoying prefight
meals of beer and junk food.
   In the end, the fan in the stand probably had less heartburn
than the entertainers.
   Penn and his movie star wife, Madonna, literally ran in and out
of the cocktail party at the Trump Plaza Hotel _ without a bite to
eat _ after dozens of reporters and photographers descended upon
the couple. Madonna grinned in delight; Penn looked annoyed.
   As a crowd of photographers went into action, Penn said,
``That's it man,'' then grabbed a TV cameraman by the shoulders and
pushed him into an elevator door, according to the New York Daily
News.
   Comedian Milton Berle tried taking bites of his gourmet dinner
in between interviews, but ultimately sent his food back to the
kitchen.
   ``It was cold,'' he said, shrugging.
   Actors Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and singer Paul Simon
grinned at each other in amusement as the same pack of journalists
fell onto the table in front of them. Blinking their eyes at the
hundreds of flashbulbs and only smiling in response to questions,
they, too, didn't eat a bite.
   Nicholson, a veteran of these prefight parties, came prepared
with his own bottle of mineral water.
   Outside the din, up in the rafters, Debbie McPhee and her
daughter, Noel, of Wheatfield, Ind., relaxed before the main bout.
   ``We had calzone for dinner on the Boardwalk,'' Noel said.
   Both were delighted with the view from their seats, almost in
the last row.
   A few rows away, Joe Paone sat with five other men, from Hudson,
N.Y. They had crammed into a van the night before, drove seven
hours to Atlantic City and had beer for dinner.
   ``This is a mission,'' Paone said. ``Maybe we'll have a piece of
pizza after the fight.''
   The $300 price tag on their seats did not bother the diehard
fans.
   It also didn't bother the celebrities who were Trump's guests.
   ``They let me in for nothing,'' joked comedian Jackie Mason.
``At these prices, I'll watch anything.''
   Comedian Billy Crystal, however, said, ``I'm a big fight fan.
... I'm glad to be here. If I wasn't doing what I'm doing in life,
I wouldn't be here. It's the price you pay for being here.''

<HEAD>Dollars Drops After Record Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar today dropped from a six-month record
high posted the previous day, while stock prices on the Tokyo
exchange closed slightly lower after rebounding from heavy
early-morning losses.
   The dollar opened the day's trading at 130.48 yen, down a strong
1.22 yen from Monday's close of 131.70. It moved mainly between a
low of 130.38 and a high of 131.25 before finishing the day at
130.95 yen.
   King Ogino, a dealer at Goldman Sachs, said the dollar's loss
against the yen was driven by a comment from Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa, who during a regular press conference dismissed
recent currency changes as ordinary fluctuations. The minister said
the central bank would step into the market if necessary.
   Ogino said the statement led to ``depressed dollar-selling at
the 130.80-130.90-yen level'' and further profit-taking sent the
currency to about 130.85 yen before it rebounded slightly.
   Today's loss snapped the dollar's six-day winning streak during
which the currency rose by a total of 4.82 yen. Monday's close of
131.70 yen was the highest finish for the dollar since Dec. 10,
when it closed at 132.18 yen. The next day, the currency tumbled to
128.75 yen.
   Ogino said the mood on the foreign exchange market for the rest
of the week would be dictated by movements of the central bank.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues, a 121.20-point loser Monday, regained lost
ground following heavy morning losses. But it still ended the day
at 27,398.09, down 36.92 points, or 0.13 percent.
   The main market barometer had dipped 257.47 points by
mid-morning but climbed back, led mainly by large-capital issues,
including steels and low-priced blue chip stocks, traders said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 2.5 billion shares,
nearly three times the 850 million shares that changed hands Monday.

<HEAD>Carnation's Plans For New Infant Formula Criticized By
Pediatricians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An announcement by Carnation of a new infant
formula was met by criticism from the American Academy of
Pediatrics, which said it would fight any effort by the company to
advertise the formula directly to consumers.
   Richard Narkewicz, president of the 34,000-member academy, said
he has written a letter to Carnation's president, Timm F. Crull,
which reads, in part, ``Any attempt to dissuade mothers from breast
feeding by advertising infant formula directly to the public would
be strongly condemned by the academy.''
   On Monday, Carnation announced the introduction of an infant
formula that the company says will help some infants who are
allergic to existing formulas.
   Richard Curd, spokesman for Carnation Nutritional Products in
Los Angeles, said that the company plans an information campaign
that will alert the public to the problem of infant formula
allergies. He said the advertising will not mention the new
product, but will mention Carnation.
   Existing makers of infant formula have voluntarily complied with
the pediatrics academy's long-standing ban on advertising formula,
Narkewicz said.
   Adele Haley, a securities analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham
& Co., who specializes on the pharmaceutical business, said she
didn't think the product would be a big seller.
   She said Carnation made a ``less than convincing'' argument that
it has a significantly different product. The new formula appears
to be ``a small niche product'' similar to Bristol-Myers' infant
formula product called Nutramigan, she said.
   The formula, called Good Start H.A., is a whey-based,
predigested formula that Carnation says will not cause allergies in
some children who are allergic to conventional cow's milk formulas
or formulas from soybeans.
   Dr. Richard Hamburger, a professor of pediatrics at the
University of California, San Diego, who spoke at press conference
here on the company's behalf, said that perhaps 8 percent of
American children are allergic to milk-based and soy-based
formulas, which he said are the most commonly used in the United
States.
   Some of those children may not be allergic to Good Start H.A.,
which contains predigested, or broken-down, proteins, said
Hamburger. Precisely how many children might be helped by the
formula is unknown, he said, because the studies to find that out
have not been completed.
   Dr. William Weil, professor of pediatrics at Michigan State
University and former member of the pediatrics academy's nutrition
committee, said in a telephone interview that many children have
food disorders of some type, but ``in my opinion, it's rare that
it's really due to allergy.''
   Of the Carnation product, he said, ``It does not sound to me
like they've come up with anything in the way of a breakthrough for
feeding problems in infancy.''
   In a statement released at the Carnation press conference, Ernie
Strapazon, assistant general manager of the Nutritional Products
Division, said: ``The company has developed an information campaign
for Good Start H.A. targeted at consumers and focusing on formula
intolerance symptoms. The message will direct consumers to their
pediatrician for the solution to problems of infant formula
intolerance caused by cow's milk-based or soy-based formulas.''
   Narkewicz expressed concern that the academy's nutrition
committee was not given the opportunity to determine whether the
product meets standards for infant nutrition.
   ``When we learn what this formula is, we will have our committee
look at it and see _ does it satisfy the standards,'' Narkewicz
said in a telephone interview from Chicago, where he was attending
a meeting of the American Medical Association.
   ``But I'll tell you one thing,'' Narkewicz said. ``We are going
to strongly fight them if they are advertising infant formula
directly to the public.''
   The academy's opposition to public advertising stems from its
concern that such advertising may encourage women to use formula
rather than to breast feed their infants, Narkewicz said.
   ``Quite frankly,'' Narkewicz said, ``if breast feeding is the
best, and you've got a multimillion dollar promotion for formula,
who's going to put up the dough to advertise that breast feeding is
best? Nobody.''

<TEXT>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms lingered in the Southwest
today after spawning a twister in New Mexico, drenching an Air
Force base in San Antonio, Texas, and flooding streets in a Texas
county.
   The Northeast, north-central states and much of the Pacific
Northwest enjoyed cool weather, but it was still warm in the
northern Plains and the South, where 10 temperature records were
broken or tied Monday.
   Rain today extended from Arizona to Texas. A few showers and
thunderstorms also fell on the northern Rockies, as well as western
South Dakota and northwest Minnesota, two states hit by the
drought. Showers and isolated thunderstorms fell across north
Florida.
   The strongest Southwestern storms were clustered between
Cotulla, Del Rio and San Antonio, Texas. More than 2{ inches of
rain drenched Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio in less than
an hour Monday night, and urban flooding occurred in eastern Bexar
County.
   A tornado touched down 15 miles north of Carlsbad, N.M., on
Monday night, but no damage was reported.
   In Florida, evening storms unleashed wind gusting to 55 mph and
hail as big as ping pong balls that damaged car windshields near
Cherry Lake.
   Temperatures dipped into the 40s in the northern Applachians,
and the 40s and 50s were common in Oregon and Washington state.
Temperatures were mostly in the 50s from the Great Lakes to the
upper Ohio Valley and the northern and middle Atlantic Coast.
   In Youngstown, Ohio, it was 45 degrees early today, tying the
record low for the date set in 1970.
   By contrast, temperatures were in the 80s in sections of the
northern Plains and the Gulf Coast, with a few readings in the 90s
across the desert Southwest.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Pacific Northwest to the Colorado Rockies, the southern
High Plains and Texas; scattered showers and thunderstorms from the
northern Great Lakes into New England, and across much of the
Florida Peninsula; and mostly sunny, dry conditions for the rest of
the nations.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 80s or 90s for much of
the nation; the 60s and 70s across the Pacific Northwest and from
the upper Great Lakes to the upper Ohio Valley and New England; and
100 to 105 degrees in the Rio Grande Valley, the Northern
California valleys and the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 94 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>Judge Won't Let Defense Call Meese in Wedtech Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Bronx borough president denied taking
even ``one cent'' from anyone at Wedtech Corp., and the judge ruled
that Attorney General Edwin Meese III can't be called as a defense
witness.
   The former Bronx leader, Stanley Simon, who is on trial with
Rep. Mario Biaggi and five others for alleged corruption involving
the defense contractor, took the witness stand in his own defense
Monday.
   Also Monday, U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley said
testimony from Meese or a former top aide, whom the defense also
wanted to call, was ``irrelevant to this case.''
   The defense maintains that it was Meese and others with ties to
the Reagan administration _ not the defendants _ who ``acted
corruptly'' in helping Wedtech obtain no-bid government contracts.
   The defense says Wedtech officials had links to Meese through
San Francisco attorney E. Robert Wallach, a longtime Meese friend
under indictment for allegedly taking money from Wedtech to
influence the attorney general. Meese has not been charged with any
wrongdoing.
   But prosecutors in the 17-week-old trial asserted the request
was ``a very obvious effort to confuse and divert the jurors.''
   Simon, Biaggi, Biaggi's eldest son, Richard, and four others are
charged with turning the now-bankrupt Bronx company into a
racketeering enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes to
obtain the minority set-aside contracts.
   In addition to Meese, the defense wanted to call former Meese
aide and Wedtech employee James Jenkins.
   ``It is imperative now to show the actual extent of Meese's and
Jenkins' corrupt involvement in this matter,'' Dominic Amorosa,
attorney for Richard Biaggi, wrote the judge last week. ``Only by
doing this will Richard Biaggi be able to present a full picture of
the scheme to frame him and his father.''
   In a letter opposing the defense request, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Howard Wilson said it was ``in reality, an attempt to
cause a minitrial on the issue of the guilt of the attorney
general.''
   Wilson asked Motley not to allow Amorosa ``to turn this
proceeding into a circus, from a trial of his client and Mario
Biaggi into a trial of Ed Meese and others.''
   Earlier, Simon, the first defendant to testify, said he never
took bribes or kickbacks.
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Simon, who is accused of demanding
$50,000 in cash, campaign and charitable contributions from Wedtech
in return for his help in obtaining a city lease for the company.
   Simon denied ever making the request of Wedtech Chairman Fred
Neuberger, who testified for the government in exchange for
leniency.
   ``Did you ever get a cent _ one cent in cash from any Wedtech
person?'' asked defense attorney Maurice Nessen.
   ``No!'' Simon replied.
   He said his 1985 re-election campaign received two checks
totaling $15,000 from Neuberger and his partner, John Mariotta, who
is also a defendant in the trial.

<HEAD>AMA Trustees Calls For Crackdown on Drug Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key to winning the war on drugs is in
reducing demand for illicit narcotics by treating users, not in
spending billions to catch smugglers and pushers, a report to
nation's largest doctors' organization says.
   A report by the American Medical Association's board of trustees
calls for revamping the nation's efforts to combat the drug problem
by focusing more energy and money on rehabilitating drug users.
   Many doctors endorsed the proposal during a committee hearing
Monday at the AMA's annual policymaking convention. The committee
is expected to issue a recommendation today on whether the
420-member House of Delegates, a legislative body representing the
AMA's 295,000 members, should approve the proposed drug policy
before the convention ends Thursday.
   ``We think this lays out a blueprint for the American people to
effectively do something about the drug problem,'' said Dr. Lonnie
Bristow, an AMA trustee and internist from Berkeley, Calif.
   ``We frankly hate to see money just going down the tubes while
our nation talks about whether we should have the Army and the Navy
patrolling the borders to interdict drug sellers.''
   He said the AMA board's report shows the nation's
much-publicized war on drugs has ``been a failure because it's had
the wrong focus.''
   With annual revenues estimated at $30 billion to $100 billion,
drug traffickers have the money to counteract government
crackdowns, the report contends.
   ``They can acquire sophisticated technology, bribe public
officials and recruit new members. With such a strong financial
base, these organizations have demonstrated the ability to counter
each new interdiction strategy.''
   Bristow said: ``As long as we concentrate on the supply end of
the problem, we're just pouring money into a sieve.''
   The AMA board's report recommends that the federal government
expand drug abuse treatment programs, ease regulations to permit
private doctors to treat addicts with methadone and improve drug
education programs aimed at adolescents.
   It doesn't say how much extra money should be spent for these
efforts.
   The report notes that one federal rule makes it difficult for
addicts to get treatment by generally only admitting to methadone
programs people who have been addicted to heroin for at least a
year. It recommends modifying the rule to let doctors running such
programs admit any patient physically dependent on opiates.
   ``The need for new treatment centers is acute,'' the report
said. ``Only about 150,000 of the estimated 1.4 million IV drug
abusers currently are in treatment.''
   The proposal also calls on the president to appoint ``a
high-ranking official of the executive branch to coordinate federal
drug policy'' to reduce rivalry among different agencies and keep
them from working at dual purposes.
   The AMA board reiterated its opposition to widespread random
drug testing of employees working in private industry.
   But it said limited workplace drug testing should be ``carefully
evaluated'' when it's done in conjunction with a treatment program,
as part of pre-employment screening for jobs affecting the public's
health and safety or when an employer suspects a worker's
performance is impaired.
   The AMA board also said it opposes legalization of illicit
drugs, contending such a move would lead to increased drug use. The
report calls the nation's renewed efforts to combat the drug
problem ``laudable,'' but says, ``they have yet to lead to
substantial reductions in the use of illegal drugs.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislative committee rejected a proposal to
distribute clean hypodermic needles to drug addicts in Boston to
curb the spread of AIDS.
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said after Monday's
vote. ``But I can't afford to be disappointed and upset very long _
not when you look at babies and people dying of AIDS.''
   The measure received an unfavorable report after an emotional
debate during a joint committee on Health Care hearing. After the
10-3 vote against the bill, it proceeds to the House floor, where
supporters said they had no hope of reversing the committee's
negative recommendation.
   ``The band is playing on and on,'' Larry Kessler, director of
the AIDS Action Committee, said after the vote.
   The needle exchange was supported by Flynn and several medical
experts but was opposed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, his Public
Health commissioner and the Massachusetts Medical Society.
   The bill would authorize a six-month pilot program to distribute
sterile needles to about 200 of the estimated 14,000 intravenous
drug abusers in Boston. Supporters said they hoped to find evidence
of reduced AIDS transmission.
   Kessler faulted legislators for their ``lack of courage,'' and
said it was hypocritical for lawmakers to argue that a needle
exchange would undermine the ``war on drugs'' when the state has
refused to provide adequate funding for drug treatment centers.
   ``What we saw here today was a classic example of despicable
doublespeak,'' Kessler fumed, hinting that the next step might
involve ``civil disobedience'' in the form of unauthorized needle
distributions.
   Flynn said he shared Kessler's frustration but would not condone
law-breaking. Instead, he said he would fight to educate the public
and the Legislature about the risk of AIDS, to expand drug
treatment centers and to reach out to addicts to encourage them to
sterilize their needles with bleach.
   ``After the fall election, maybe there'll be a better
environment,'' Flynn said, referring to the legislators'
re-election campaigns and the governor's presidential effort.
``They didn't vote for it today. But they will vote for it.''
   In committee, opponents argued that for the state to distribute
hypodermic needles to addicts would send a message that the
government condones illegal drug abuse.
   ``Unless we're prepared to talk about the legalization of drugs
_ which we're not _ the passage of the petition would be grossly
inconsistent,'' said Rep. Marjorie Clapprood, a Democrat.
   Rep. John McDonough, a Democrat and the bill's chief proponent,
urged his colleagues to at least test the effectiveness of a needle
exchange program in slowing the spread of AIDS, which can be
transmitted through sharing of contaminated syringes.
   ``The question that will come before us is, did we do everything
we could to stop this tragedy?'' he argued.
   Supporters noted that Massachusetts is one of the few states
where it is against the law to sell or distribute hypodermic
needles and a state with one of the highest rates of AIDS increase.
The sharing of dirty needles among drug addicts is a major cause of
the spread of the disease.
   The first U.S. needle exchange program is scheduled to begin
soon in Portland, Ore.
   Earlier this month, Dutch researchers reported an an
international AIDS symposium in Stockholm that four years of
providing clean syringes to addicts in Amsterdam produced a
significant drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb the
spread of AIDS, but did not lead to increased drug use.

<HEAD>Vatican Overhaul Includes More Control Over Its Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today ordered the creation
of a watchdog panel for the scandal-linked Vatican bank as part of
a series of administrative reforms.
   Announcement of the reforms, long under study, was timed for
today's elevation by the pope of 24 cardinals at the Vatican.
   An overhaul of Vatican administration, known as the Curia, was
carried out in 1967 under John Paul's predecessor, Paul VI, who
called for many streamlining reforms in the spirit of the
modernizing Second Vatican Council of 1962-65.
   In his written introduction to the 111-page document outlining
the reforms, John Paul II describes them as approaching in
``inspiration and intent'' those generated by the work of the
Second Council.
   The Vatican administration ``from time to time has grown to ever
vaster dimensions,'' the pope wrote in the introduction to the new
constitution, as the document was called.
   Vatican observers described many of the changes as contained in
the 193-article constitution as minor.
   But among the more significant changes was an article dealing
with the Vatican bank, formally known as the Institute for
Religious Works.
   The bank, headed by American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, was
involved in Italy's most sensational banking scandal, the collapse
of Banco Ambrosiano.
   The scandal centers on the disappearance of $1.3 billion lent by
the Milan-based bank to 10 dummy overseas companies. Investigators
allege Marcinkus wrote letters to financial officials assuring them
the Vatican controlled the dummy companies.
   Last year, Italian judicial authorities issued arrest warrants
for Marcinkus and two top lay employees of the Vatican Bank,
accusing them of being accessories to fraudulent bankruptcy.
   But Italy's Constitutional Court ruled that Italian-Vatican
treaties forbid the three from being prosecuted.
   Traditionally, the Vatican bank has been answerable only to the
pope.
   Under the new reforms, the institution, while not technically
part of the Vatican administration, would have to inform a council
of 15 cardinals about its transactions.
   A Vatican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
ad hoc group of cardinals, who have been working on the Vatican's
budget problems, has actually been performing a kind of oversight
of the bank for some time.
   The official said the council does not actually control the bank
under the new restructuring.
   In another reform, the Vatican's Council for Public Affairs, its
foreign ministry, will be put under one of two sections of the
secretariat.
   Under the old system, it exercised much autonomy.
   A Vatican official familiar with the changes in the curia said
that in the past, the foreign ministry played a key role in
deciding candidates for bishops. Now that role will be almost
exclusively carried out by the Congregation for Bishops, with the
foreign ministry involved only at the diplomatic level.
   Among the 1967 reforms of Paul VI was one allowing use of modern
languages instead of Latin in official documents. John Paul II's
reforms reflected that change, with the constitution written in
Italian.
   Another thrust of the Second Vatican Council was greater use of
lay people in church affairs.
   In his introduction to the reforms, John Paul calls for creation
of a Vatican work commission to deal with lay employees, who have
protested in past months for better pay.
   Part of the reason for streamlining the Vatican bureaucracy
stems from the Vatican's deficit, which was projected at $61.8
million for 1988.
   However, it was not immediately revealed if and how the changes
could save the church money.

<TEXT>
   A woman accused of gouging out a
16-year-old boy's eye to rid him of demons cannot be called an
exorcist during her trial despite telling police she performed six
exorcisms, a judge decided.
   The terms ``exorcism'' and ``exorcist'' might prejudice some
jurors hearing Andrea Cowan's case, even though the words don't
necessarily have negative connotations, Judge Michael McDonald
ruled Monday.
   A six-member jury was chosen after McDonald's ruling, and
prosecutors and defense attorney John Calmes were to present their
opening arguments today.
   Cowan, 26, is charged with cruelty to a juvenile, which carries
a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Detectives who arrested her in March 1987 said she quoted the
Bible to justify her action: ``And if thy right eye offend thee,
pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee
that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body
should be cast to hell.''
   The boy, Darnell Washington, had a history of fasting to rid his
body of what he believed to be a demonic possession, authorities
said. He had convulsions at school on March 23, 1987, and was taken
to Baton Rouge General hospital by ambulance.
   After he was released that afternoon, his family began an
exorcism, authorities said. When the family decided they could not
expel the demons from the boy, they called Cowan, her husband,
Kevin, and their pastor, David Cowan, Kevin Cowan's brother.
   Andrea Cowan told detectives she has performed at least six
exorcisms in which she prayed demons away.
   ``God was acting through Andrea,'' said David Cowan, pastor of
Rock Zion Baptist Church. ``It was a very stubborn demon because
there were more than one in him.''
   Andrea Cowan told arresting officers that at the time of the
ritual ``she was not of this world _ Jesus had taken over her
body.''
   She told detectives that after prayer failed, she took the boy
upstairs to beat the demons from him. When that didn't work, she
stuck a finger into his left eye socket, plucked out his eyeball
and released the demons, she told detectives.
   She said the boy spoke in the devil's voice and vomited a
``mucus matter,'' that she recognized as the devil.
   ``We cleaned the eye, and he went on to bed,'' David Cowan said
in an interview a few days after the incident. ``We covered the
eye, and we prayed God would heal it. And whatever prevailed, that
was God's will.''
   Two days after the ritual, a nurse from Baton Rouge General
telephoned the boy's home to check on his condition and was told of
the eye injury. The nurse urged the family to take the boy back to
the hospital.
   Detective Erika D'Amico said that when she interviewed the boy
and asked him what happened to his eye, ``he started shaking and
said `God did it.'''
   The youth then began gurgling and talking incoherently, she said.
   Authorities took custody of the boy and he was taken to a New
Orleans hospital for treatment.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls on Reported Intervention, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped rapidly in moderate trading
today following reports that European central banks moved in
concert to stem its rise.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said the central banks of West Germany, Britain, France,
Italy and Switzerland sold dollars in the market to prevent the
currency from rising further.
   The dollar had reached its highest levels in eight months
against European currencies, buoyed by lack of central bank
intervention and strong demand, particularly from Japan.
   Today's intervention followed reported dollar sales by the U.S.
Federal Reserve on Monday.
   ``For the first time in months, we seem to see something like a
coordinated intervention,'' one dealer at a West German bank said
on condition of anonymity.
   A senior trader with a major Italian commercial bank in Rome
said: ``The central banks are making it loud and clear they want a
dollar below 1.80 marks for the moment.''
   Another trader in Italy argued that the dollar's recent rise had
been too swift for central banks and the reported intervention
should be seen as a signal to the market to calm down.
   ``Today's joint effort by central banks was designed to deflate
the dollar slightly. But the market still remains bullish on the
dollar,'' he said.
   But the West German dealer said the market's sentiment on the
dollar already has cooled a bit, with most dealers seeing the
currency as overbought.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday,
were:
   _1.7965 West German marks, down from 1.8185
   _1.4880 Swiss francs, down from 1.5050
   _6.0625 French francs, down from 6.1385
   _2.0293 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0460
   _1,335.00 Italian lire, down from 1,353.48
   _1.2065 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2075
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7272, stronger
than $1.7030 Monday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 130.95. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 129.97 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $443.75 a troy ounce, up
from late Monday's $441.50. At mid-morning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $443.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $444.00, up from $443.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.16 to close at a bid of
$446.30.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.96 a troy
ounce, up from Monday's $6.84.

   The interior minister said today that two
Turks had been arrested for claiming they wanted to kill Pope John
Paul II and accused the two of perpetrating a hoax to gain
publicity.
   ``During the papal visit, there was no attempted
assassination,'' Interior Minister Karl Blecha told reporters
following a Cabinet meeting today. On Monday, the pontiff ended a
five-day Austrian pilgrimage.
   A U.S. television network reported Monday that a plot to
assassinate John Paul during the recent visit was uncovered and
foiled in Vienna.
   But Blecha, whose ministry oversees many police and security
functions, said the plot was nothing more than a hoax to ``to grab
the attention of the world news media.''
   ABC News quoted unidentified sources as saying two Turks were
the prime suspects in the alleged assassination attempt that was to
have taken place last Thursday, the first day of the visit.
   The network reported that the assassination attempt was to take
place as the pope arrived at St. Stephens Cathedral in Vienna. It
said it had learned that police believed shots were to be fired
from a construction site across from the cathedral.
   ABC News said the Austrian government had confirmed that,
following a tip, its anti-terrorist police found photographs ``that
show several sniper positions in the building plus firing angles to
the square.''
   The network said police apparently foiled the alleged plot when
they raided an Islamic prayer building used primarily by Turkish
immigrants.
   Speaking of the pair's arrest two days before the pope arrived
in Vienna, Blech said: ``No weapons were found, only a warning
pistol unable to shoot bullets.
   ``They were arrested and charged with faking a criminal act but
were not kept in jail,'' he said.
   The interior minister did not identify them or say where they
were.
   According to Blecha, one of the suspects told police on June 13
that an attempt on the pope's life was planned. After further
investigation, police discovered the second man, who turned out to
be the first suspect's accomplice, Blecha said.
   It was not immediately clear why they sought the publicity or
how they may have intended to escape responsibility themselves.
   In Ankara, Yahya Kucuk, head of the political division of
Turkey's General Directorate of Security, said officials had no
information or query from Vienna in connection with Turks involved
in a foiled plot against the pope.
   In 1981, a Turkish terrorist shot and wounded the pope in St.
Peter's Square in Rome.

   Civil libertarians are outraged that the
editor of a small newspaper serving the black community was
indicted on a charge of criminal libel for a column criticizing two
politicians.
   ``Free speech means nothing if someone can go to jail for
criticizing the government,'' said Steven Bates, chairman of South
Carolina's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   The ACLU said it will petition for dismissal of the charges
announced Monday against Jim Fitt, editor of The Voice, a
Williamsburg County weekly with a circulation of 2,300.
   State Rep. B.J. Gordon, who is black, and state Sen. Frank
McGill, who is white, brought the charges in response to a May 17
column in which Fitts urged voters to reject the politicians in the
June primary and accused them of stealing.
   Representatives of reporters' groups called the indictment a
step backwards.
   ``I'm really appalled,'' said Jane Kirtley, executive director
of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Washington.
``You don't throw people in jail in this country for stating an
opinion.''
   If convicted, Fitts faces up to $5,000 in fines and a year in
prison on each of the two counts.
   Kirtley said she could not recall a case in which a journalist
was sent to prison for libel.
   McGill and Gordon, both Democrats and the county's
representatives in the Legislature, won the election.
   Fitts, 62, wrote in part: ``I will say to you, without fear of
contradiction, if every black in Williamsburg County would start
stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives,
they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their
time in power.''
   The column gave no specifics. When asked later what he thought
they had stolen, Fitts said only that they had taken the pride of
people of Williamsburg County.
   Fitts said Monday he expected the indictment and would ask to
have the trial moved out of the county.
   ``The power structure has long roots in Williamsburg County,''
he said.
   Wallace Connor, the attorney for McGill and Gordon, said Fitts
was only seeking publicity for his newspaper.
   Fitts showed no emotion as the indictment was read. Afterward,
he told reporters: ``I'm not surprised. I'm not disappointed. And I
welcome the opportunity to be heard in court. I got what I wanted.
   ``We need some relief in order that the county can grow
economically,'' he said.
   Williamsburg County, with about 40,000 people, ranks 43rd among
the state's 46 counties in per capita income, with an average of
$7,579 in 1986, the latest available figures. More than 60 percent
of the agricultural county is black and about a quarter of its
residents are on food stamps, according to the state's Division of
Research and Statistics.

<HEAD>Survey Says Kennedy Most Overrated American; Reagan No. 2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John F. Kennedy is the most overrated public
figure in American history, while his predecessor, Dwight D.
Eisenhower is among the most underrated, according to a sampling of
historians and journalists.
   Kennedy topped the voting among 75 prominent historians and
journalists surveyed by American Heritage magazine, with President
Reagan taking second place among the most overrated Americans.
   Neither was a consensus choice, however. Kennedy was picked by
eight of the experts; Reagan by four.
   The results appear in the July-August issue of American Heritage.
   Four public figures, all presidents, tied for first place in the
most underrated category, but only got two votes each: Eisenhower,
John Quincy Adams, Ulysses S. Grant and James K. Polk.
   Of Kennedy, historian and novelist Thomas Fleming wrote: ``I
write this with a lump in my throat. But the record shows that his
public relations approach to the presidency was an almost total
disaster for the nation, from the Bay of Pigs to the Berlin Wall to
the missile crisis to the halfhearted intervention in Vietnam.''
   Fleming was among those who chose Polk, the seldom-remembered
11th president, as the most underrated public figure. He called
Polk a ``hardworking and decisive'' president ``who brought a
program to the office and realized almost all of it. ... We could
use a large dose of his example today.''
   Eisenhower was the choice of historians Walter Lord and Arthur
Ekirch. When Eisenhower stepped down in 1961, Lord wrote, he had
``left the country strong and prosperous; the civil rights battle
was off to an important start at Little Rock; and Joe McCarthy had
been defused.''
   Presidents dominated both ends of the survey, with Woodrow
Wilson and Harry S. Truman tying for third place among the most
overrated figures. However, numerous non-presidents, including
several women, received votes.
   Among the women named as the most underrated American were
Eleanor Roosevelt, Abigail Adams, the radical theorist Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, transcendentalist Margaret Fuller and journalist
Sarah Josepha Buell Hale. Betsy Ross picked up a most-overrated
vote.
   Finally, these were the choices of University of Chicago
professor Martin E. Marty, who probably deserves a vote for most
original respondent of the survey:
   Most overrated American: Uncle Sam.
   Most underrated: John Q. Public.

<HEAD>Key Quotes From Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Party Conference
^With PM-Soviet-Party, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are key quotations from Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's opening address Tuesday to the 19th Communist Party
Conference.
   _ On farming:
   ``We must restore the economic balance between town and
countryside, and release to the utmost the potential of collective
and state farms by promoting diverse contractual and lease
arrangements.
   ``We must make the farmer sovereign master, protect him against
command methods and cardinally change the conditions of life in
villages. That is the only way to rapidly heighten the efficiency
of the agro-industrial sectors, and to secure a radical improvement
in food supplies across the country.''
   _ On economic reforms and price increases:
   ``The pricing reform cannot fail to affect retail prices as
well, because they are closely connected with the system of prices
as a whole. Today the retail price of many food products, notably
that of meat and milk, is considerably lower than the actual cost
of producing them, lower than the state's procurement price.
   ``The state is compelled to cover this difference in the form of
a subsidy to the consumer. That is not a normal situation. It
undermines the incentives for producing these products and gives
rise to a wasteful attitude, especially towards bread.
   ``We know all this perfectly well, comrades. It is absolutely
necessary, therefore, to resolve this problem no matter how
difficult it may be and no matter what doubts and fears it may
create at first glance.''
   _ On human rights:
   ``Now about the personal rights of citizens. Here, too, there is
a need for more precise legislative regulation.''
   ``Our entire legal system is designed to guarantee strict
observance of the rights of citizens to the inviolability of their
private life, home, the secrecy of telephone communication, postal
and telegraph correspondence. The law must reliably protect a
person's dignity.''
   _ On the establishment of the post of president of the Supreme
Soviet, or parliament:
    ``In the opinion of the CPSU Central Committe, establishing the
post of President of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet would be in line
with enhancing the role played by the supreme bodies and by the
entire system of the Soviets of People's Deputies, strengthening
the rule-of-law basis of government and improving the
representation of the Soviet Union in world affairs.
   ``It should be ruled that the President shall be elected and
recalled by secret ballot by, and be fully answerable and
accountable to, the Congress of the U.S.S.R. People's Deputies.''

<HEAD>Judicial Probe Demanded into Disputed Killings by Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international human rights group today demanded
the British government set up a judicial inquiry on Northern
Ireland, claiming existing rules are inadequate to prevent killings
by security forces.
   Citing 25 deaths of unarmed people at the hands of security
forces in disputed circumstances since 1982, Amnesty International
said an inquiry was ``vital to ensure that effective procedures and
safeguards are instituted'' to prevent ``unlawful killings.''
   The group released a report focusing on six deaths in late 1982
that prompted accusations that police were then operating a
``shoot-to-kill policy'' against suspected guerrillas in the
British-ruled province and that they subsequently covered it up and
obstructed an independent official investigation.
   Spokeswoman Fae Junaid said Amnesty believed the need for an
inquiry had become more urgent because it said the government
failed to deliver on promises made this year to hold inquests and
disciplinary proceedings against officers allegedly involved in the
1982 incidents.
   The 94-page report said existing rules were ``inadequate in
enforcing exacting standards for the behavior of security forces to
prevent the excessive use of lethal force.''
   It said few such cases have been prosecuted, and ``in these
cases, most defendants have been acquitted.''
   A judicial inquiry was needed because government investigations
were ``an inadequate means for bringing out the full facts,'' it
said.
   Amnesty pointed to an account by John Stalker, a detective sent
from Britain to investigate the 1982 killings. Stalker claims he
was blocked when he got close to proving the existence of a
``shoot-to-kill'' conspiracy.
   The London-based organization noted that the government admitted
in January that Northern Ireland police officers tried to pervert
the course of justice, but that for ``national security'' reasons
no one would be prosecuted.
   The report said most unarmed victims of police and army
shootings since 1982 were Roman Catholics, and some belonged to the
mainly Catholic Irish Republican Army and Irish National Liberation
Army fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
   It recognized that the police and army were prime targets of IRA
and INLA attack, but insisted that ``the rule of law does not
permit the exclusion of any citizen from the criminal justice
system.''
   The government has refused to set up a judicial inquiry, saying
the police and army are best equipped to investigate disputed
incidents.
   The report also complained that ``the main procedure used in
Northern Ireland for making facts public, the coroner's inquest, is
so severely restricted that it cannot serve as a mechanism for
investigating the full circumstances surrounding any incident of
killing.''
   Amnesty said that since prosecutions were so rare in shootings
by security forces, inquests were bereaved families' only means of
discovering the truth.
   But it said inquests were sometimes delayed for years.

<HEAD>Coalition Unveils Blueprint For Health Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``basic benefits package'' _ a blueprint for
health insurance _ has been unveiled by a coalition of businesses,
labor unions, medical organizations and insurance companies.
   It was devised by the Health Policy Agenda for the American
People and is designed to become the standard by which private and
public health insurance plans are measured, officials said.
   Consumers can use it as a checklist to use when comparison
shopping for a comphrehensive health insurance policy, they said.
   The group unveiled its plan at the American Medical
Association's annual policymaking convention. The coalition was
launched at the AMA's initiative and began work last year.
   ``What it says is there are certain health insurance benefits
that should be included in a basic package. It is a blueprint for
health benefit plans,'' said Diane McCarthy, a member of the
committee that developed the package.
   ``It defines the specific types of coverage and services that
should be in a basic benefits plan, but it is not a mandatory
formula. Americans should consider this a core set of benefits to
use as a guide to tailor specific benefits plans and to help them
comparison-shop for insurance,'' Ms. McCarthy said.
   According to the coalition of 172 public and private
organizations, a basic health insurance package should cover such
items as:
   _ Maternity and child care, including pre- and post-birth
examinations, along with some benefits for well-child care.
   _ Immunizations and periodic medical examinations for early
detection of illness.
   _ Semi-private room and board in a hospital.
   _ Treatment by doctors and surgeons inside and outside the
hospital.
   _ Mental health treatment, including for drug and alcohol abuse.
   _ Home health-care, nursing home care and hospice care at home
for people with a terminal illness.
   ``Prior to this time, no one has been able to define the level
of health care to which every American ought to be entitled,'' said
Dr. James Todd, speaking for the AMA, which helped develop the plan.
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer Federation
of America, another coalition member, said 37 million U.S.
residents now have no health insurance and an additional 30 million
to 40 million have inadequate insurance
   The health coalition estimated that such a health insurance
package would cost $270 a month for a family or $110 for an
individual.
   Such a plan would have a $200 deductible for the first hospital
admission in any calendar year, a $100 individual deductible for
all other covered services or a maximum $250 family deductible.
   It also would require consumers to pay 20 percent of the costs
for covered services up to a maximum of $1,500 for an individual or
$2,500 for a family.

<HEAD>CDC: Giving Out Free Fans To Poor, Elderly Not A Hot Idea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health researchers say giving free fans
to the poor and elderly during heat waves may not be such a great
idea, because fans could actually increase heat stress instead of
relieving it.
   The national Centers for Disease Control has sent state health
officers an advisory on precautions to take during heat waves,
particularly to safeguard the health of the poor and elderly.
   A review of occupational comfort and occupational health studies
dating back to the 1920s shows that fans may only blow hot air on
the person who's trying to cool off, said Dr. Ed Kilbourne of the
CDC.
   ``As the temperature gets around 100, we find that above that,
increasing air velocity tends to increase heat stress,'' Kilbourne
said in an interview Monday.
   He stressed that other factors, including humidity, come into
play in discussing heat stress.
   ``But under some circumstances, where areas are diverting
resources to hand out fans, the money may be better spent in
getting people to shelters.''
   The CDC, in its weekly report last Thursday, recommended that in
times of severe heat, special care should be taken to protect
elderly and poor people, particularly inner-city residents, against
heatstroke and other illnesses.
   ``For example, elderly persons may be taken to an
air-conditioned shopping mall for 2-3 hours per day,'' the CDC
suggested.
   Kilbourne said the CDC's research has cast doubt on one widely
held notion _ the idea that air conditioning may make some people
more susceptible to heat-related illnesses when they leave the cool
indoors. ``That appears not to be the case,'' he said.
   The CDC studied heat-related deaths in 1980, when more than
1,700 such fatalities were reported nationwide.
   In July 1980, St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo., were among cities
noticing a sharp increase in deaths during a time of severe heat.
Deaths from all causes in St. Louis were up 57 percent from July
1979; in Kansas City, it was 64 percent, Kilbourne said.
   ``You can double or triple the daily number of people dying
during a heat wave,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S.-Built TVs Shipped to Japan Amid Predictions More Will Follow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKLIN PARK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weak dollar, a productive workforce
and American hardwood combined to convince Japanese electronics
giant Matsushita to make Panasonic TVs here and start shipping them
back home for sale.
   ``Japan is a different market, and these sets today represent an
honest attempt to market and sell a product based on conditions
there ... not just send over whatever we build,'' Richard Kraft,
president of Matsushita Industrial Co., said Monday as the first of
5,000 sets were loaded for shipment.
   Kraft said the two most important factors in the decision to
build the sets in this Chicago suburb were savings of about 10
percent and the design of the cabinet, which makes extensive use of
U.S. hardwoods and craftsmen.
   He said he could not estimate what the 27-inch sets would cost
in Japan, but a comparable product for the U.S. market would range
between $1,500 and $2,000.
   While U.S.-made materials account for about 70 percent of each
set, Kraft noted the televisions are unusuable in this country
because the settings, power supply and frequencies are adapted for
foreign use.
   The plant manufactures more than one million sets annually for
the North American market. By designing the product specifically
for sale in Japan, Kraft predicted Americans can make genuine
inroads into the Japanese market.
   ``Hopefully, this is just a small beginning to what ultimately
will lead to a more balanced trading situation between all
countries of the world _ but especially the United States and
Japan,'' he added.
   Gov. James R. Thompson joined the plant's executives and 800
workers for a brief ceremony, then lauded the company for paying
attention to the new realities of global business.
   ``Americans are always being eternal optimists, believing what's
good enough for us is good enough for the rest of the world,'' said
Thompson.
   ``But there are cultural differences, consumer differences and
technology ... and all play a role in the success of marketing a
product. This is what the smartest business have always done,'' the
governor said.

<HEAD>Armenian-American Videotapes Protests In Soviet Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television producer who traveled to
strife-torn Soviet Armenia showed videoptape of about 50,000
protesters thrusting their fists into the air and chanting ``We
want freedom.''
   The rare sight, a revealing look at civil unrest behind the Iron
Curtain, was shot by Ashot Dorian, an Armenian-American freelance
cable television producer.
   Dorian was recently in the area, which has been closed to
Western reporters and camera crews, for two weeks to attend a
festival honoring an Armenian classical music composer.
   He said some of his footage will be shown on a public access
cable television show he produces.
   ``My videotape footage shows both the desperation and the
determination of the people there to have justice and human rights
for the Armenian people,'' Dorian said Monday. ``I saw things that
people from the West don't have an opportunity to see.''
   Footage of one rally he screened for The Associated Press
revealed a crowd of about 50,000 who raised their arms with
clenched fists in a defiant pose as they shouted ``We want
freedom'' and ``We will fight to the end.''
   Soviet Armenians want to annex a disputed region called
Nagorno-Karabakh from neighboring Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is a
community of mostly Christian Armenians surrounded by the
predominantly Moslem republic of Azerbaijan.
   In recent months, thousands of Armenian demonstrators have
marched in the streets. At least 35 have been killed in
confrontations with police, and hundreds have been injured.
   Labor strikes, hunger strikes and rallies have erupted in
several cities in Soviet Armenia, but Communist Party officials
said Sunday that Armenian residents in Nagorno-Karabakh have called
off their general strike.

   Charges have been dropped against seven of eight
people accused in the beating death of a drug-addict who stole $20
from a customer at a bakery, and the only remaining defendant plans
to ask that his charges also be dropped.
   The Manhattan district attorney's office announced Monday that
manslaughter charges against seven people accused in the death of
Raymundo Carabello, 41, had been dropped for lack of evidence.
   Charges remain against an eighth person, Jesus Negron, 23. He
has been indicted on charges of first- and second-degree
manslaughter in the March 20 mob attack and is being held in
$15,000 bail. He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of
first-degree manslaughter.
   The eight were charged with chasing down Carabello and beating
and kicking him to death after he snatched $20 from a woman in the
Capri Bakery.
   Negron's lawyer, Ira Van Leer, said he planned to ask that the
charges be dropped.
   ``You can't say my client was the cause of this,'' he said. ``He
was one of 20 or 30 people that took part in it, and all of them
were cut loose.''
   Colleen Roche, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said four defendants admitted using force to restrain Carabello but
evidence showed Negron had kicked the man continuously while he was
down.

   An industrial accident involving cyanide
poisoning today left four people dead and 20 injured at a northeast
Indiana plating company, officials said.
   A spokesman at Bastian Plating Co. said the accident occurred at
about 5 a.m. Bastian Vice President Dennis Fry said four workers
died and several more were taken to DeKalb County Memorial Hospital.
   Fry said he did not know what chemical was involved or how many
workers were in the plant at the time of the accident.
   ``There was no explosion. It was an industrial accident,'' Fry
said.
   Hospital spokeswoman Maryellen Schimmoller said 20 people were
being treated for what she believed was cyanide poisoning.
   ``At this point everything's hectic,'' Ms. Schimmoller said.
``We're putting people in quarantine. They're having to be very
careful with what they're handling.''
   Lt. Ken Hollingsworth of the Indiana State Police said the
accident involved cyanide poisoning. Hollingsworth said one Auburn
police officer also was hospitalized for observation.
   No additional details were immediately available. Auburn is
about 135 miles east of Chicago.

<TEXT>
   With a schism in the church looming only two
days away, Pope John Paul II elevated 24 churchmen from 17
countries to cardinal today and pleaded anew for unity in the Roman
Catholic Church.
   The 24 included two Americans, Archbishops James Hickey of
Washington and Edmund Szoka of Detroit.
   The pope used the occasion to appeal to followers of rebel
French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who appears set to provoke the
first break in the church in more than 100 years.
   Addressing members of the College of Cardinals during a
closed-door ceremony to approve the new cardinals, the pope said
the rupture with Lefebvre now seems inevitable.
   Lefebvre, an ultra-traditionalist who rejects many of the
reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council, has threatened to
consecrate four bishops on Thursday without the pope's permission,
a move which would mean excommunication for the 82-year-old prelate.
   Without referring to the French prelate by name, the pope told
the cardinals gathered in the frescoed Consistory Hall of the
Apostolic Palace:
   ``We are very saddened by the news of which we are all aware
that one of our brothers in the episcopate ... wants to ... ordain
bishops and thus to break the principle of unity of the church,
taking with him a large number of his followers into schism.''
   Addressing Lefebvre's followers, the pope added: ``We pray and
exhort them that they remain in the paternal home and that they see
that it is there where the real truth of faith and correct behavior
is found.''
   The remarks, made in Latin, were released by the Vatican.
   The consistory, as the session is known, began with the pope and
58 veteran cardinals formally approving the papal nominees during
the closed-door ceremony.
   Then Vatican Secretary State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli read out
the names of the new cardinals in front of an audience of about
10,000 people in Paul VI auditorium.
   Large delegations of American pilgrims from Washington and
Detroit vigorously applauded when Hickey and Szoka were named.
   Each of the new ``princes of the church,'' wearing crimson
vestments and a golden cross, then went up to the stage to receive
their certificate from Casaroli.
   Next, the pope arrived and the new cardinals then again climbed
the stairs to receive their three-cornered cardinal hats.
   Each knelt in front of John Paul, who handed each of the
prelates a scroll and embraced them.
   The new cardinals bring to 160 the membership in the College of
Cardinals, the church's most important governing body. Those under
the age of 80 are eligible to elect the pope's successor.
   The cardinals also act as advisers to the pontiff, serve on
special Vatican commissions and often act as de facto spokesmen for
the church in their countries.
   Four of the new cardinals come from Italy, two each from the
United States, Brazil, Spain and India, and one each from Canada,
Mozambique, Colombia, Australia, Hungary, Cameroon, Austria,
France, West Germany, Mauritius, Hong Kong and Lithuania.
   Vatican officials attributed special political significance to
the pope's appointment of cardinals for Lithuania, the Roman
Catholic stronghold in the Soviet Union; and Hong Kong, the British
colony that passes to Chinese communist rule in 1997.
   The majority of the college of cardinals, a total of 84, have
been named by John Paul during his nearly 10-year-old papacy.
   During the elevation, the pope also announced long-awaited
reforms of the Vatican administration, or Curia. One of the reforms
is aimed at increasing the church's supervision over the Vatican
Bank, which was linked to Italy's worst postwar banking scandal.
   On Monday, a senior Vatican official said no negotiations or
mediation efforts were under way with Lefebvre.
   In a statement released in Switzerland the same day, Lefebvre's
movement claimed he is acting in an emergency and is thus immune
from sanctions.
   The last schism in the church involved a group known as ``Old
Catholics,'' who broke with the Vatican in 1870 after the First
Vatican Council proclaimed the infallibility of the pope.

   Soviets should be free of interference in their
private lives and able to speak their minds provided they do not
oppose the political structure or the Communist Party's monopoly on
power, Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today.
   In his speech opening the 19th Communist Party conference at the
Kremlin, the Soviet leader touched on political and judicial
reforms, the rights of religious believers and the demands of
political and ethnic dissidents.
   ``The entire law-and-order structure of ours is called upon to
guarantee strict observance of the citizens' rights to the
inviolability of private life and the home, privacy of
correspondence, postal and telegraph messages,'' he said.
   The Soviet legal system must ensure that a person is innocent
until proven guilty and that all people get equal treatment before
the law, the Soviet leader said.
   Those rights and the right to speak out on the issues before
Soviet society have been violated since the time of dictator Josef
Stalin and must be restored, he said.
   But the reform-minded Soviet leader drew a line at challenges by
ethnic minorities to the existing boundaries of the Soviet Union
and by political dissidents to the Communist Party's monopoly on
power, which is proclaimed in the Soviet Constitution.
   ``Some think that any questions _ from the redrawing of borders
to the establishment of opposition parties _ can be resolved''
through glasnost, his policy of greater openness, Gorbachev said.
``The Central Committee believes such abuses of democratization run
counter to the tasks of perestroika, contradict the peoples'
interests,'' he said.
   He expressed confidence that Soviet people could tell the
difference between ``genuine champions of perestroika and glasnost
from those who are guided by goals alien to the goals of socialism
and the one-party sytem.''
   Even though they have a different world view than Communists,
``all believers, irrespective of their faith, are equal citizens of
the Soviet Union,'' Gorbachev said.
   A new law on freedom of conscience now being written will ensure
equal treatment for believers, he said.

<HEAD>Israelis Shoot Two Young Palestinians, Arabs Strike in Jerusalem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LABELLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded a 12-year-old and another Palestinian teen-ager today, and
Arabs shut down east Jerusalem to protest the 21st anniversary of
its annexation to Israel.
   Israeli troops blocked Palestinians in the occupied territories
from entering Jerusalem after an underground Arab leaflet ordered
the the disputed city to be the target of today's general strike.
Arabs shuttered shops and schools in east Jerusalem.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, two Palestinians were shot,
both in the left leg, near the central marketplace, officials at Al
Ittihad Hospital and one of the youths said.
   Samer Wawi, 17, said he was surrounded by two Israeli patrols
when he was shot. ``They didn't speak to me. They only fired at
me,'' he told The Associated Press from his hospital bed.
   Hospital officials identified the second person wounded as Subhi
Munib Saayeh, 12.
   The army provided no details, saying it was checking the reports.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 211 Palestinians and four
Israelis have been killed.
   In Jerusalem today, heavy police forces patrolled the eastern
Arab sector of the city and guarded the gates of the walled Old
City.
   Underground Leaflet No. 20, signed by the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Arab leaders of the uprising, called for marches
and a general strike ``in affirmation of the Arab identity of
Jerusalem.''
   At least 10 outlawed Palestinian flags were raised on utility
poles this morning.
   The status of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues in
the Arab-Israel conflict. Israel captured east Jerusalem from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, when it also seized the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank.
   Since then, Israel has declared Jerusalem its capital, but most
foreign countries do not recognize that status and keep their
embassies in Tel Aviv.
   Jerusalem has 340,000 Jewish and 135,000 Arabs residents. The
city is considered holy by Jews, Moslems and Christians.
   Members of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Herut
Party held a counterdemonstration with the theme ``Jerusalem is
Ours.'' About 20 cars formed a caravan and drove through parts of
Jerusalem, with Israeli flags flying from the windows.
   ``We are going to show the Arabs the only flag allowed in Israel
is the Israeli flag and the capital of Israel is Jerusalem,'' said
a local Herut leader, Reuven Rivlin.
   In the West Bank, cities and towns from Bethlehem south of
Jerusalem to Nablus in the north were paralyzed by the strike.
   Arabs who wished to reach jobs in Israel outside of Jerusalem
were generally stopped by stone-throwing youths, who told them to
stay home in keeping with the daylong strike.
   A firebomb was thrown at a bus near Bethlehem carrying
Palestinian workers to Israel and one woman was injured, Israel
radio said.
   Palestinians ranging in age from about 8 to 16 gathered in
Nablus streets, building road blocks and setting fire to junk piles.
   The strike also halted most activity in the Gaza Strip, where
Israeli troops clamped curfews on two refugee camps after
stone-throwing incidents.
   On Monday, Arabs heeded their leaders' call for protests and
stoned Israeli vehicles in more than a dozen locations.
   A Jewish seminary student was slightly injured in the head by a
stone, and seven Arabs were arrested, police said.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron on Monday, about 200 soldiers
surrounded the Al Husseini High School after students stoned
Israeli vehicles. Some troops chased students into the school,
firing tear gas and rubber bullets, Arab witnesses said.
   Officials at Hebron's Alia Hospital said 25 students were
treated for tear gas or beating injuries. The witnesses said troops
detained about 50 students. The army confirmed the clash but did
not provide details.

<HEAD>Shooting Deaths May Be Related To Polygamist Religious Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four people, including three one-time followers
of a polygamist leader, have been slain here and in suburban
Dallas, and authorities say the shootings may stem from a religious
dispute.
   No arrests have been made in the Monday shootings, but police
said they were seeking three sons of the late polygamist patriarch
Ervil LeBaron. LeBaron died in a Utah prison in 1981.
   LeBaron's Church of the Lamb of God split into several groups
after his death. Polygamist sects broke off from the Mormon Church
when it outlawed multiple marriages in 1890.
   Duane Chynoweth, 31, and his daughter Jennifer were found shot
to death Monday in a pickup truck parked outside a vacant house in
Houston, police spokesman Dan Turner said.
   Chynoweth was apparently delivering an appliance to the vacant
house, and police were trying to determine who arranged for the
delivery. The shootings occurred shortly after 4 p.m.
   At around the same time Duane's brother, Mark Chynoweth, 36, was
found shot to death at a business about 10 miles away, Turner said.
LeBaron was Mark Chynoweth's father-in-law.
   In Irving outside Dallas, Eddie Marston, 32, one of LeBaron's
stepsons, was also shot to death shortly after 4 p.m. Irving police
Officer Richard Gilmette said Marston was found shot in the head
and upper body.
   Turner said Duane Chynoweth was a polygamist, but he did not
have any information about Mark Chynoweth.
   ``We are trying to put it all together, but it looks like it's
going to be a religious cult deal,'' Turner said. ``We're trying to
figure it all out now.
   A neighbor of the Chynoweth family, who did not want his name
used, said Mark Chynoweth's wife talked to his wife after the
killings.
   ``Apparently, Lillian told my wife they tried to break away from
a cult, and there was a death list,'' the man told the Houston
Chronicle.
   LeBaron died while serving a sentence for the 1977 murder of a
rival polygamist leader, Rulin Allred.
   Marston and Mark Chynoweth were acquitted in Allred's slaying.
Marston also had been suspected in the 1975 slaying of another
polygamist leader, but a witness died before the case went to trial.
   LeBaron's sons also are being sought for questioning in the
slaying in Sanpete County, Utah, last October of polygamist leader
Daniel Ben Jordan.
   Ervil LeBaron and some of his ex-followers were said to have
each claimed to be the ``One Mighty and Strong,'' a man many
polygamist groups believe will someday come to reform The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

   Nearly 150 guerrillas loyal to PLO chief
Yasser Arafat today pulled out of a refugee camp devastated by the
artillery of Palestinian dissidents who dealt their mainstream PLO
faction a major setback.
   Syrian soldiers at the entrance to the Chatilla camp in Beirut
searched the defeated fighters and confiscated their arms. Two
bodies, a man and his fiance, were carried on stretchers to two
waiting ambulances.
   The loyalists had fought the dissidents for two months for
control of of Chatilla and an adjacent shantytown, Bourj
el-Barajneh.
   Today, they were put in three trucks bound for the southern port
of Sidon, about 25 miles to the south, but were stopped on the way
by a leftist Lebanese militia that controls the city.
   Libyan escorts tried to persuade the militiamen to let the
Palestinian evacuees enter and the Syrian officers who accompanied
the convoy from Beirut turned back after giving the guerrillas back
their weapons.
   In all, 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded since May 1,
when fighting broke out between loyalists and opponents of Arafat
in Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh.
   The Syrian-backed dissident Fatah-Uprising faction, led Col.
Saeed Mousa, overran Chatilla in a 13-hour battle Monday. Most of
Arafat's 200 fighters then surrendered to Syrian and Libyan
officers.
   Another 60 loyalists held out until early today, when they
emerged from Chatilla's ruins escorted by 30 Libyan officers and
soldiers.
   Fatah-Uprising then seized a large ammunition dump in Chatilla
that belonged to the mainstream faction, a Palestinian official
said.
   Syria has thousands of troops enforcing security in west and
south Beirut, but none made any attempt to stop the fighting for
Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh, which flared despite reconciliation
between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad in April to end a
5-year-old feud.

   A leading member of an alternative political party
has been arrested and sentenced to 15 days in jail for taking part
in a demonstration, a group spokesman said today.
   Yuri Mityunov, spokesman for the Democratic Union, said the
arrest was aimed at keeping the Democratic Union quiet during the
national Communist Party conference, which opened today.
   Mityunov said in a telephone call that Igor Tsarkov was arrested
at his workplace at a Moscow computer center Monday and sentenced
later that day by a court to 15 days in jail.
   Tsarkov was charged with taking part in an illegal demonstration
June 11, Mityunov said.
   At the Communist Party conference, Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in
an opening speech he would not tolerate alternative political
parties in the Soviet Union.
   Mityunov says the Democratic Union, which advocates a
multi-party sytem, has about 200 members nationwide, most of them
in Moscow and Leningrad. It was founded in May.

   More than nine years have passed since Charles
Mingus, the seminal jazz bassist and composer, died at age 56 in
Mexico, where he was being treated for Lou Gehrig's disease.
   During that time, Mingus' innovative compositions and
arrangements have been perpetuated in performances by the Mingus
Dynasty Band, an ensemble of varying personnel led by trombonist
Jimmy Knepper, who played with Mingus in the late '50s and '60s.
   An expanded version of the Mingus Dynasty Band celebrated the
late jazz bassist with a joyous JVC Jazz Festival concert Monday
night at the Kaufmann Concert Hall at the 92nd Street Y.
   Although fewer than half the seats in the 926-seat hall were
filled, those in attendance got a pleasurable lesson in what made
Mingus such an influential force as jazz moved from bebop into the
more eclectic styles of the 1960s.
   Monday night's band combined elements of the old _ former Mingus
bandsmen Jaki Byard on piano, Jack Walrath on trumpet, John Handy
on alto saxophone and Knepper _ with the young _ Jon Faddis on
trumpet and Craig Handy (no relation to John) on tenor saxophone.
   Mingus' lush arrangements, in which the horns and saxophones
weave dense patterns of sound as a backdrop for the soloists, were
as fresh as when he did them more than two decades ago.
   The set opened with ``Jump Monk,'' Mingus' up-tempo appreciation
of the late pianist Theolonius Monk.
   Another object of Mingus' affection, Duke Ellington, provided
the inspiration for ``Duke Ellington's Sound of Love,'' a lovely
ballad launched with a moving solo by Byard.
   Mingus' genius as a composer and arranger came through most
strongly in ``Stop, Look and Listen,'' an ambitious collection of
rhythms, moods and styles from his acclaimed album on the Impulse
label, ``The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady.''
   Rounding out the band was Sam Burtis on trombone and tuba, David
Murray on tenor saxophone, Nick Brignola on baritone sax, George
Mraz on bass and Billy Hart on drums.
   Monday's concert opened with a courageous set by pianist Geri
Allen and her trio. The program of original compositions started
slowly, but gradually picked up excitement as the trio warmed to
the occasion.
   Although largely in the avant-garde style of polytones and
polyrhythms, Ms. Allen's music retained sufficient melodic content
to hold the audience's interest, and she received a warm ovation.
   The JVC Jazz Festival continues in New York through Saturday.

   Rescue teams today pulled more bodies from the
crumpled steel of a runaway commuter train that slammed into a
crowded train about to leave a Paris station. At least 55 people
were killed.
   A fire department spokesman said the death toll was probably
final from the scene of the Monday evening crash, the worst rail
accident in Paris history. But the spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said some of those hospitalized were in grave
condition.
   Officials said 15 passengers were seriously hurt, another 17
were injured less severely and 14 more were treated at the scene.
   Philippe Rouvillois, director general of the state-owned train
company known as SNCF, said the company, the Transport Ministry and
judicial officials had begun into the cause of the crash at the
Gare Lyon, the city's largest train station.
   Another company official, Roger Gerin, said the ``origin of the
accident was in difficulties with the braking system but we do not
know the exact cause.''
   Authorities said the eight-car commuter train, coming into an
underground track at the busy station in eastern Paris, split open
the first of the stationary train's four cars.
   The moving train was sliced open lengthwise and the stationary
train buckled upward.
   Two young riders, a man and a woman, were discovered early today
trapped under a mound of steel. The woman, kept on an emergency
life support system while rescue workers tried to saw her out,
could not be saved.
   The man's legs had to be amputated to remove him.
   Gerin said the engineers of both trains were well qualified. He
said both engineers jumped from the trains before the collision.
   He said the engineer of the moving train, Daniel Saulin,
realized the brakes were not working and warned passengers to move
to the back of the train.
   The engineer of the train in the station, Andry Tanguy, also had
time to warn passengers. Announcements over loudspeakers told them
to leave the train.
   Gerin said trains undergo maintenance four times a year, in
addition to routine checks. He said the commuter train had been
checked three days earlier.
   Gerin confirmed that the train entered the station traveling at
40 to 50 miles per hour.
   Before the accident, Gerin said, the train had made 15 stops and
the brakes worked normally at each of the stops.
   He said a passenger pulled an alarm signal, causing the train to
stop at a station five miles from Paris that is not normally a stop.
   ``During this 26-minute stop, the engineer experienced
difficulty in trying to re-arm the brake system, but he resumed his
trip,'' Gerin said.
   As he approached the station, the engineer experienced more
braking difficulties and alerted the stationmaster, Gerin said.
   At midmorning, two diesel trains attached to an enormous steel
cable were used to pull apart the trains. Rescue workers carried
the dead away from the wreck on stretchers or in plastic bags.
   Rouvillois said the moving train _ coming from the southeastern
suburb of Melun _ went through a red signal light about 500-600
yards from the station.
   ``When the driver noticed a problem with the brakes, he asked
travelers in the train to move toward the back,'' Rouvillois said.
   ``All at once I saw the train coming toward me at high speed and
I had just enough time to jump onto the platform,'' said the driver
of the standing train, who was not injured.
   About 250 firefighters were helping with the rescue and
recovery, aided by medical teams and dozens of police.
   Officials said the train that was hit was full and behind
schedule by several minutes.
   The Gare de Lyon, on the right bank of the Seine River, is the
largest of six major train stations in Paris, covering nearly 15
acres. It is a stop for the city's subways and handles commuter
traffic as well as intercity trains.
   The last major train accident in Paris was in January 1981 at
the Auber station, when two suburban trains collided, killing one
person and injuring 71.
   Two major train accidents occurred in France in August 1985. Two
trains collided Aug. 3, 1985 on a one-way track at Flaujac-Gare in
the southwest, killing 32 people and injuring 160. On Aug. 31, a
derailed train was hit by another at Argenton-Sur-Creuse in central
France, killing 43 people and injuring 37.
   The train crash was the second major transportation accident in
two days in France. On Sunday, a new Air France Airbus 320 crashed
at an air show near Mulhouse in eastern France, killing three
people and injuring 50 others.

   Ann Richards, tapped as the keynote speaker
for the Democratic National Convention, said today she will consult
with advisers to apparent nominee Michael Dukakis and rival Jesse
Jackson before preparing her speech.
   She also suggested, on a light note, that she might be a
good-luck charm for the party.
   Noting that fellow Texan Barbara Jordan was the only previous
female keynoter at a Democratic Convention, in 1976, she said,
``That year the Democrats went to the White House so maybe they saw
my selection, having another female, as a good omen.''
   Before the convention, she said in an interview on CBS-TV, ``I
wanted to be sure to look at the Democratic platform. I wanted to
consult with both the Dukakis campaign and the Jackson campaign.
And of course I welcome any help and any advice that I get.''
   Ms. Richards is known for using blunt rhetoric tempered with
wicked humor to get her point across.
   At a recent Democratic Party fundraiser in Houston, one man
after another _ none of them minorities _ came to the podium to
speak. Finally it was the turn of Ms. Richards, the Texas state
treasurer and potential 1990 gubernatorial candidate.
   ``Now are there any other white men who haven't spoken yet?''
she said sweetly. ``God knows we don't want to leave any of you
out.''
   The audience roared with laughter, as Ms. Richards' audiences
usually do. And, as usual, her audience got the message.
   On Monday, her stump style was praised by Democratic Party chief
Paul G. Kirk as he announced her selection as the speaker whose
address will open the party's convention next month in Atlanta.
   The 54-year-old Ms. Richards, Kirk said at a Washington news
conference, ``has the ability to tell it like it is.''
   Kirk said Dukakis had urged the selection of a woman keynote
speaker, the first since Rep. Jordan shared that honor with John
Glenn.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' the party chief said, ``not only because of the importance
of the family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that
women are going through in the daily work lives and family lives,
but I think it is symbolic of the importance of women to the
American family and the realities of all of that.''
   Ms. Richards, the first woman in 50 years to hold statewide
office in Texas, is the divorced mother of four grown children.
   In 1976, her first attempt at elected office, Ms. Richards
defeated an incumbent Travis County commissioner. In 1982, the
state's incumbent treasurer, under indictment for official
misconduct, withdrew from a Democratic runoff against her. She won
the general election and was re-elected without opposition in 1986.
   After the 1982 election, Ms. Richards moved quickly to change
operations in the state treasury. She also made staff changes,
boosting the number of women and minorities on the job in the
170-employee agency. She now claims the agency payroll has an
ethnic and sex balance reflecting the state's general population.
   Ms. Richards said Monday that women's issues are ``the same
issues that affect all other human beings'' _ but with a twist.
   ``The difference is the role, sociologically, that women have
played. That is we are the caretakers, the nurturers,'' she says.
``It usually falls to us when any time hard times and bad times
hit.''
   It's a message often repeated by Ms. Richards. If you can make a
household work, she says, you can succeed in government.
   ``Most homemakers don't know what enormous skills they have.
Putting three meals on the table each day is a pretty big job in
itself, much less doing the laundry and car pooling,'' she once
told a reporter.
   Her professional success has come despite personal challenges.
In 1980, after being confronted by family members, she sought
treatment for alcoholism. She says she has not had a drink since
then, and she has been active in helping others battle alcoholism.
   Shortly after her treatment, she and husband David Richards
separated, and in 1984 the two obtained what they both said was an
amicable divorce.
   Richards, a lawyer, was on hand Monday when his ex-wife talked
to reporters about being selected to give the keynote speech. She
acknowledged him as someone who ``played a very large role in my
life, politically and personally.''
   Beyond the convention and helping to put a Democrat in the White
House, Ms. Richards' most immediate goal is the 1990 Texas
gubernatorial race. She has not formally declared her intentions,
but sent out her first exploratory fund-raising letter Monday.
   Ms. Richards said she is not certain what effect her half-hour
in the political spotlight in Atlanta will have on her
gubernatorial race.
   ``I suppose if I'm good it will help,'' she said Monday. ``And
if I'm bad it won't.''

   A Mexican woman has identified as her son
a partly deaf young boy who was found last fall wandering near
downtown Juarez, Mexico, a newpaper reported today.
   Micaela Aguilera de Garcia, 32, of Tampico, Mexico, said Monday
she is making plans for a reunion with the boy she believes is her
9-year-old son, nicknamed Chuy. Tampico is on the Gulf of Mexico
1,120 miles southeast of Juarez.
   ``I'm at peace now _ now that I know he's all right,'' the woman
told the El Paso Times.
   Because the boy does not speak, write or use sign language, U.S.
and Mexican officials have been unable to determine where he is
from. He was nicknamed Sabath because he was found on a Saturday.
   The FBI was called into the case when Mexican officials noticed
Sabath prefers American food and cartoon characters to their
Mexican counterparts, leading them to believe Sabath could be
American.
   FBI agent Terry Kincaid said he had heard reports about the
Tampico woman.
   ``We have reports from Tampico, Mexico, from both a lady who
thinks it's her son and from ... authorities who think the picture
of Sabath they were shown is the same boy who they picked up about
a year ago,'' Kincaid said.
   He said photographs were being sent from Tampico, and they will
be shown to the boy.
   Aguilera's search for her missing son had taken her to crowded
cities and remote villages along Mexico's Gulf Coast during the
past nine months.
   She was arranging transportation to Juarez, across the border
from El Paso. Sabath has been living in a shelter for neglected and
abandoned children in Juarez.
   The woman, a housekeeper who lives with her mother and four of
her five children, said she would consider giving up the child if
that would get him into a specialized school for the deaf. She said
her son had run away from home in the past.
   Mariana Paredes de Aguilera, the boy's grandmother, grasped
Sabath's picture and with tears welling in her eyes said, ``Oh,
that's him. My God, it's him.''

   Democratic presidential nominee-to-be Michael
Dukakis will step up his search for a running mate this week by
meeting about 30 senators, among them prospective candidates for
the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Dukakis, back from a four-day vacation, planned to tout his
record on housing issues today before heading to Washington on
Wednesday to meet with the senators.
   On the Capitol Hill itinerary is a meeting with Georgia Sen. Sam
Nunn, who said Monday he was not providing the Dukakis campaign
with background and financial information it has requested of
prospective running mates.
   ``He knows my position on the vice presidency,'' Nunn said in a
telephone interview.
   Nunn said he had told the Massachusetts governor and Dukakis
campaign chairman Paul Brountas that a spot on the Democratic
ticket is ``not on my agenda.'' Brountas is heading the search for
a running mate.
   Another prominent senator, New Jersey's Bill Bradley, last week
said he had informed Dukakis that he did not want to be considered.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington also declined to
provide personal background and finances to the Dukakis campaign,
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today.
   Requests for background and financial information from
prospective running mates have gone out in the past two weeks.
Those under consideration, according to sources, included Jesse
Jackson, Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, Nunn, John Glenn of Ohio, and
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas as well as Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt, also reportedly have been asked to provide information to
Brountas.
   Dukakis' decision to schedule the meetings with senators on
Wednesday pushed back by a day a campaign swing through the
Midwest. Dukakis will return to Washington before next month's
Democratic National Convention to hold similar sessions with House
members, his campaign said.
   Aides, meanwhile, said there was no timetable for making or
announcing the choice for the second spot on the ticket.
   The Massachusetts governor has said he hoped to select a running
mate prior to the Atlanta convention, scheduled for July 18-21, but
aides were quick to deny a report in the Boston Herald that the
decision might be made as early as Monday.
   ``That's wrong,'' Brountas said in a telephone interview. ``It's
going to take more time than that to get the work all done.'' He
did say, however, that it would ``make a lot of sense'' to complete
the search in advance of the convention.
   Private campaign polling on the strengths and weaknesses of
potential running mates has not been completed. While early
campaign polls had general questions about the No. 2 spot on the
ticket, current polling is more detailed.
   The polling won't be finished this week, said one campaign
source.
   Although Dukakis himself says he dislikes polling and contends
it will have little impact on his decision _ a position shared by
Brountas _ other ranking campaign officials are awaiting the poll
results.

<HEAD>AMA Trustees: Prisoners Should Be Tested</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Medical Association committee
recommended today that the AMA adopt new proposals for battling
AIDS, including a call for AIDS testing of all prison inmates and
for tracing the sexual partners of AIDS victims.
   Many doctors had opposed the proposal for mandatory testing of
prison inmates during a hearing Monday before the committee.
   The House of Delegates is scheduled to vote Thursday on the AIDS
proposals, which were drafted by the AMA's Board of Trustees.
   The trustees' report, debated Monday, recommended that states
``give serious consideration'' to contact tracing of all AIDS
victims. And it called on federal and state governments to expand
treatment programs for intravenous drug abusers.
   The report also recommended that U.S. women infected with the
AIDS virus avoid breast feeding to reduce the chance of giving the
disease to their children and called for ``vigorous enforcement''
of existing anti-discrimination laws to protect AIDS victims.
   In addition, the board called on President Reagan to create a
new national AIDS commission, identical to the one that just
finished its work, ``to provide the essential coordination between
public and private institutions that are addressing AIDS.''
   The AMA's board also issued four background reports on related
AIDS issues, and individual state delegations have proposed five
additional AIDS policies.
   ``This is a disease we can't become casual about,'' said Dr.
John Dawson, an AMA trustee and surgeon from Seattle. ``We're still
waiting for the explosion of cases that will arouse the country.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's ability
to fight disease and is spread primarily through sexual
intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from mothers to their
infants. It is fatal and incurable.
   By 1991, the nation likely will have 270,000 cases of AIDS, the
report said.
   Dr. Robert Bernstein, the Texas health commissioner, opposed
testing prisoners for AIDS because most state correctional systems
can't segregate AIDS victims from other inmates.
   ``Why test if you're not going to do anything about it?'' he
said. He also estimated that it would cost at least $120,000 to
conduct just one round of testing on Texas' 40,000 prison inmates.
   But Dr. John Watson of Columbus, Ga., said he favored testing
prisoners as a way of protecting inmates who don't have AIDS
because of the prevalence of homosexual rape in prisons.
   The AMA trustees also recommended that states seriously consider
launching a program of contacting the sexual partners of AIDS
victims in an effort to slow the disease's spread among
heterosexuals.
   ``You have the potential for a frightening expansion of AIDS
into the heterosexual community,'' Dawson said. ``That's where
contact tracing would be important.''
   A separate AMA trustees' report focusing on intravenous drug
users recommends that federal and state governments increase
spending for free drug treatment programs.
   ``Experts in the field agree that this is the most important
step that can be taken to reduce the spread of (AIDS) infection
among intravenous drug abusers,'' the report says.
   It also calls on authorities to clean up ``shooting galleries''
where addicts gather to inject drugs because they pose a potential
for spreading the disease.
   The hearing committee also recommended that the AMA delegates
adopt the following AIDS proposals calling for:
   _ The federal government ``to continue to'' quickly investigate
new, experimental AIDS treatments so that they can be made
available as soon as possible to victims of the disease.
   _ The AMA to study the issues surrounding whether doctors
infected by the AIDS virus should be allowed to continue to
practice medicine.
   _ The government to begin a second nationwide study to determine
the rate of the disease's spread.
   _ The government to prevent discrimination against AIDS victims
in employment, housing and other areas.
   ``The more discrimination that goes on with AIDS,'' Dawson said,
``the more you're going to drive it underground and have difficulty
dealing with it.''

   Rescue teams today pulled more bodies from the
crumpled steel of a runaway commuter train that slammed into a
crowded train about to leave a Paris station. At least 55 people
were killed, a fire official said.
   A fire department spokesman said the death toll was probably
final from the scene of the Monday evening crash, the worst rail
accident in Paris history. But the spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said some of those hospitalized were in grave
condition.
   Officials said 15 passengers were seriously hurt, another 17
were injured less severely and 14 more were treated at the scene.
   Philippe Rouvillois, director general of the state-owned train
company known as SNCF, said the company, the Transport Ministry and
judicial officials had begun into the cause of the crash at the
Gare Lyon, the city's largest train station.
   Another company official, Roger Gerin, said the ``origin of the
accident was in difficulties with the braking system but we do not
know the exact cause.''
   Authorities said the eight-car commuter train, coming into an
underground track at the busy station in eastern Paris, split open
the first of the stationary train's four cars.
   The moving train was sliced open lengthwise and the stationary
train buckled upward.
   Two young riders, a man and a woman, were discovered early today
trapped under a mound of steel. The woman, kept on an emergency
life support system while rescue workers tried to saw her out,
could not be saved.
   The man's legs had to be amputated to remove him.
   Gerin said the engineers of both trains were well qualified. He
said both engineers jumped from the trains before the collision.
   He said the engineer of the moving train, Daniel Saulin,
realized the brakes were not working and warned passengers to move
to the back of the train.
   The engineer of the train in the station, Andry Tanguy, also had
time to warn passengers. Announcements over loudspeakers told them
to leave the train.
   Gerin said trains undergo maintenance four times a year, in
addition to routine checks. He said the commuter train had been
checked three days earlier.
   Gerin confirmed that the train entered the station traveling at
40 to 50 miles per hour.
   Before the accident, Gerin said, the train had made 15 stops and
the brakes worked normally at each of the stops.
   He said a passenger pulled an alarm signal, causing the train to
stop at a station five miles from Paris that is not normally a stop.
   ``During this 26-minute stop, the engineer experienced
difficulty in trying to re-arm the brake system, but he resumed his
trip,'' Gerin said.
   As he approached the station, the engineer experienced more
braking difficulties and alerted the stationmaster, Gerin said.
   At midmorning, two diesel trains attached to an enormous steel
cable were used to pull apart the trains. Rescue workers carried
the dead away from the wreck on stretchers or in plastic bags.
   Rouvillois said the moving train _ coming from the southeastern
suburb of Melun _ went through a red signal light about 500-600
yards from the station.
   ``When the driver noticed a problem with the brakes, he asked
travelers in the train to move toward the back,'' Rouvillois said.
   ``All at once I saw the train coming toward me at high speed and
I had just enough time to jump onto the platform,'' said the driver
of the standing train, who was not injured.
   About 250 firefighters were helping with the rescue and
recovery, aided by medical teams and dozens of police.
   Officials said the train that was hit was full and behind
schedule by several minutes.
   The Gare de Lyon, on the right bank of the Seine River, is the
largest of six major train stations in Paris, covering nearly 15
acres. It is a stop for the city's subways and handles commuter
traffic as well as intercity trains.
   The last major train accident in Paris was in January 1981 at
the Auber station, when two suburban trains collided, killing one
person and injuring 71.
   Two major train accidents occurred in France in August 1985. Two
trains collided Aug. 3, 1985 on a one-way track at Flaujac-Gare in
the southwest, killing 32 people and injuring 160. On Aug. 31, a
derailed train was hit by another at Argenton-Sur-Creuse in central
France, killing 43 people and injuring 37.
   The train crash was the second major transportation accident in
two days in France. On Sunday, a new Air France Airbus 320 crashed
at an air show near Mulhouse in eastern France, killing three
people and injuring 50 others.

   About 15 prison inmates slashed themselves
with razors and broken light bulbs to protest surprise searches
after eight other inmates escaped from the facility earlier this
month, a prison spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, two of the Kentucky State Penitentiary escapees who
spent a week on the run before being recaptured in a shootout were
charged Monday with attempted murder and being persistent felony
offenders.
   Three prisoners are still at large from the June 16 jailbreak.
   The approximately 15 prisoners who wounded themselves in
protests Saturday and Sunday were housed in the penitentiary's
segregation unti, Cellhouse 3, where problem inmates are kept, said
prison spokesman Barry Banister.
   He said none of the injuries was serious.
   Banister said a few inmates were treated at Caldwell County
Hospital in Princeton, while others were admitted to the prison
medical unit.
   ``They feel like we've mistreated them,'' Banister said. ``It's
not really unusual after something like this is instituted.''
   The searches were an attempt to regain control over the
cellhouse, from which the eight inmates had escaped. Banister said
the five recaptured inmates were not involved in the protests.
   Inmates, however, are still managing to get razor blades, he
said. ``It's amazing how they can hide them.''
   In Taylor County, convicted murderers Ronnie Hudson, 29, and
Joseph Montgomery, 27, both of Louisville, were also charged with
being felons in possession of weapons. They were recaptured
Wednesday after police spotted them running through a field.
   Of the three remaining escapees, Banister said prison officials
had heard little since they were spotted June 21 in Memphis, Tenn.

<TEXT>
   At least 50,000 Hungarians, many
carrying torches and candles, marched quietly past the Romanian
Embassy to protest a plan to demolish thousands of Romanian
villages.
   Monday night's rally was the largest unofficial demonstration in
Hungary since an anti-Soviet uprising was crushed in 1956. Police
protected the embassy compound but did not interfere.
   The protest was organized by a dozen opposition and other
unofficial groups, but it was officially authorized by police in
this Communist country.
   ``Observers, watching the crowd and listening to the slogans
chanted, felt the demonstration was pervaded not only by
discipline, the knowledge of representing a just cause ... but an
awareness of Central European consciousness ...,'' the government
newspaper Magyar Hirlap said today.
   Before the march to the embassy, about 30,000 people gathered on
downtown Heroes' Square to hear speeches denouncing the forcible
resettlement plan, according to the official Hungarian news agency
MTI.
   The proposed plan to raze about 7,000 of Romania's 13,000
villages, which would affect hundreds of communities of people of
Hungarian and German heritage, has strained Hungarian-Romanian
relations.
   ``The demonstration reflected the anxiety Hungarian society
feels about the fate of the villages in Romania and the fact that
it is not accepting that `bulldozer policy' as a government policy
in these concluding years of the 20th century.''
   Unofficial demonstrations of up to 15,000 people have been held
before, but they were never sanctioned and sometimes dispersed by
force.
   Smaller unofficial demonstrations have been staged in Hungary
before, but they were never sanctioned and sometimes dispersed by
force.
   The crowd moved slowly past, shouting protests, then marched
back to the square, laying flowers at monuments to Hungarian kings.
   They also heard a message of solidarity from Lech Walesa, the
leader of the banned Polish free trade union movement Solidarity.
   Banners denounced the resettlement and scores of demonstrators
held up signs of place names in Hungarian, German and Romanian that
they fear will vanish from the map.
   In March, President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania announced plans
for demolishing 7,000 villages, which would be replaced by big
agricultural-industrial centers.
   Romanian state-run media have said the program aims to gain more
farmland for use by the country's collectivized agriculture, which
is plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and livestock fodder
shortages.
   The forced resettlement program would affect hundreds of
villages of Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, who complain
of official discrimination and say they are denied ethnic and
cultural rights.
   A manifesto read to Monday's crowd said: ``After 50 years, there
is another criminal committing genocide.''
   Hungarian intellectuals have denounced as genocide both the
project for demolishing villages and Romania's alleged policy of
discrimination against ethnic Hungarians.
   Monday's manifesto also referred to the mass murder of Jews and
other civilians committed by the Nazis before and during World War
II.
   The document was written by Istvan Csurka, a prominent Hungarian
opposition writer, and read by actor Istvan Bubik. It combined
appeals for restraint and for solidarity with ethnic Hungarians in
Romania.
   Csurka appealed to Hungarians to show solidarity and
determination in trying to prevent what the Magyar Nemzet newspaper
earlier Monday called Romania's ``bulldozer revolution.''
   Relations between neighboring Warsaw Pact nations have
deteriorated rapidly over the issue of ethnic Hungarians.

   Sikh extremists killed six people in
several attacks in the northern state of Punjab, the United News of
India reported today.
   The agency said a group of militants fatally shot a woman and
injured her daughter in Lahora village in the Jalandhar district
Monday night. The assailants also shot and injured an accountant in
the same village.
   The militants also opened fire in the neighboring village of
Bhantura, killing one man, the report said.
   A milkman was shot dead in another attack in Jalandhar district,
the agency reported.
   Three other people were gunned down in the the past 24 hours in
attacks by Sikh extremists in the Punjab districts of Amritsar,
Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur, the report said.
   The latest killings raised to at least 1,417 the number of
people killed this year in attacks blamed on Sikh militants.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 800 million people but they
are a majority in Punjab state. Sikh radicals, who claim they are
discriminated against by the majority Hindus, are fighting for a
separate homeland in Punjab.

<HEAD>Air France Puts Airbus 320 Back in Air</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air France sent its new Airbus A320 jetliners back
into the air today, two days after a A320 crash cast doubt on the
world's first fully computerized civilian aircraft.
   British Airways, joining Air France in confidence that the plane
is safe, put its two A320s back on the schedule today after a
precautionary suspension.
   Air France's first A320 flight since Sunday's suspension took
off from Paris bound for Duesseldorf and Berlin with 102 passengers
aboard. Seven people who had reservations failed to claim their
seats, a normal ``no-show'' rate for a European route, the company
said.
   An inquiry commission was set up to determine why the plane,
flying 30 feet above the ground at an air show in eastern France on
Sunday, failed to climb and crashed into a wooded area, killing
three people and injuring 50 others.
   The Transport Ministry defended the new jet at a news conference
Monday, saying there was no reason to doubt the plane's
performance. Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that makes
the plane, said there were indications of human error.
   Daniel Tennenbaum, head of the Civil Aviation Authority, and
state prosecutor Jean Volff said preliminary investigations showed
the Airbus was flying too low. Tennenbaum said the computerized
plane required eight seconds to respond to the command of the
pilot, who only had five seconds to maneuver because of the
altitude.
   Pilot Michel Hasseline was quoted by the French press as saying
the aircraft did not respond to his efforts to increase power.
Christian Roger, president of the Air France pilot's union, said
the engines may have failed to restart at Hasseline's command.
   The pilots' and mechanics' unions contend that safety requires a
third officer in the cockpit of A320s _ in addition to pilot and
co-pilot _ in case of a failure of the state-of-the-art computers.
   In a joint statement Tuesday they protested that the inquiry
panel was composed of supporters of the two-crew system.
   Britain and France have a big stake, along with West Germany and
Spain, in the 17-year-old consortium, Airbus Industrie.
   The company has broken into the U.S.-dominated aircraft market
and employs some 150,000 people throughout Europe. Airbus says it
has more than 500 orders or letters of intent to purchase the
narrow-bodied, fuel-efficient, computerized plane.
   Air France, like British Airways, has two 320s. Although no U.S.
airline yet operates them, Northwest Airlines has ordered 100, and
Pan American World Airways has 16 on order, with an option to buy
34 more.
   More than 400 Airbus aircraft, including the wide-bodied A300,
are in service around the world.

   A judge rejected pleas for a no-prison
sentence and ordered a former assistant judge to serve 45 days in
jail for lying at an inquest into whether she had falsified court
files to claim pay when she hadn't worked.
   District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey on Monday sentenced Jane
Wheel to between one year and three years on each of three counts,
then suspended all but 45 days. Wheel must also perform 1,500 hours
of community service over three years.
   ``It is my belief, after searching my soul, that not to impose
some time would diminish the seriousness of this offense,'' said
McCaffrey.
   Wheel's case attracted wide attention because of her ties to
three state Supreme Court justices, who along with Wheel were
charged with judicial misconduct in 1987 in separate, non-criminal
proceedings. The justices were accused of misusing their power in
order to protect Wheel.
   Wheel was found guilty Feb. 22 of lying during a 1986 inquest
into whether she falsified court files to show she heard cases on
days for which she had claimed pay.
   Attorneys for Wheel say the conviction will be appealed.
   Wheel, 55, faced up to 45 years for her conviction on three
charges of false swearing.
   Defense lawyer Richard Davis urged leniency before the
sentencing.
   ``I hope, your honor, in the long run Jane Wheel will be
vindicated,'' Davis said. ``She doesn't deserve what she has been
put through. She doesn't deserve one more minute of pain and
suffering.''
   But David Suntag, the assistant attorney general who prosecuted
the case, urged a jail sentence because he said Wheel abused her
public trust.
   ``There is no one better to know how important affirming,
maintaining and promoting the judicial system is than Jane Wheel,''
said Suntag.
   Wheel held the elected post of assistant judge in Chittenden
County, the state's most populous county. The assistant judges, who
need not be lawyers, sit on Superior Courts with the presiding
judge, who is a lawyer. She lost a re-election bid two years ago
after the allegations surfaced.
   During the nearly month-long jury trial, Wheel's lawyers
portrayed her as the victim of a court employee's vendetta and a
drive by members of the legal community to weaken the office of
assistant judge.
   Charges against two of the state Supreme Court justices were not
pursued. The third justice, retired Justice William Hill, was found
guilty on several counts by the Judicial Conduct Board. The state
Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether Hill was guilty of
misconduct.

<HEAD>Senators Want to Make EPA Part of Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Republican senators running for
re-election today introduced a bill to elevate the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet-level status.
   Conceding that the bill has little chance of passage this year,
one of the five, Sen. David Durenberger of Minnesota, said the
measure was meant as ``a signal. We want environmental protection
to receive a higher priority than it has in the past.''
   Cabinet status would give EPA more clout in dealing with other
government agencies, including Cabinet-level departments; enhance
its status in international negotiations and put environmental
issues closer to the Oval Office, the senators said.
   ``We want the next president of the United States directly
involved in making environmental policy,'' said Durenberger.
   Another sponsor, Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania refused to take
the opportunity to criticize President Reagan's environmental
record.
   ``Given where the United States was in 1980 and 1981 and his
experience, I think the president would agree concern over the
environment has sharply increased in the past six or eight years.
That's true for him and it's true for us,'' Heinz said.
   In addition to Durenberger and Heinz, the initial sponsors were
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island, Robert Stafford of Vermont and
Lowell Weicker of Connecticut.
   Durenberger said he believed Vice President George Bush, certain
to be the Republican nominee for president, had an open mind on the
issue and he did not know how environmentalists or industry would
react.
   Some Democrats might join his group as co-sponsors, he said.
   The National Wildlife Federation, the nation's largest
environmental group with close to 5 million members in affiliated
organizations, endorsed the bill as ``long overdue.''
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told reporters in a recent
conversation he believed that as a general proposition EPA should
be a Cabinet department, but saw no need to act in the current
administration because the agency in fact had equal status with
others participating in the sub-Cabinet Domestic Policy Council.
   EPA was formed out of pieces of the Interior, Agriculture and
Health, Education and Welfare departments under an executive order
of President Nixon in 1970.

<TEXT>
   The bankrupty trustee for PTL has written
to the ministry's ``lifetime partners,'' asking them whether they
think founder Jim Bakker should return to the ministry.
   Bakker is objecting to the letter, which also warns the partners
that their claims in bankruptcy court could endanger the survival
of the church.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds is scheduled to consider
modifications to the ministry's reorganization plan at a hearing in
Columbia on Wednesday. PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization a
year ago.
   The plan calls for sale of much of the assets of the ministry,
including the 2,300-acre Heritage Park USA complex in Fort Mill.
PTL has been in financial straits since Bakker left amid a
sex-and-money scandal in March 1987.
   In his letter, trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton Jr. asked the
contributors whether they felt Bakker should be allowed to return
and in what capacity. He also asked whether they would support PTL
if Bakker were allowed to return.
   Bakker, who has returned to the Fort Mill area and is seeking to
regain control of PTL, responded to the questionnaire Monday
through his attorney.
   ``Now, as PTL is facing liquidation, we request first, an
opportunity to speak to the people and explain our side of the
story, on the PTL Club program,'' Bakker said in a statement. ``We
also ask that we be permitted to lease time on the satellite
network for a separate television program to minister to the people.
   ``Fundamental fairness requires that those who founded the
ministry have an opportunity to give account to the people before a
decision is made,'' Bakker said.
   There are about 114,000 PTL lifetime partners, who contribute
$1,000 a year. They are entitled to free lodging at the Heritage
USA theme park hotel.
   Benton told contributors that they could endanger the survival
of the ministry if they don't give up their claims to lodging.
   ``If all PTL Lifetime Partners assert their claims individually
against PTL and seek to collect payment, it could seriously
handicap the survival chances of the new PTL Ministry, which is
being referred to as Heritage Ministries Inc.,'' Benton wrote.
   Benton said the modified reorganization plan would allow
lifetime partners to assign or donate their claim to Heritage
Ministries. The survey asks if the partners would be willing to
give up their claims ``in return for becoming a member (of Heritage
Ministries) with full voting rights and privileges.''
   Last December, former PTL trustee David Clark said 60 percent of
the current and former PTL donors who responded to another mail
questionnaire said they would stop contributing if Bakker returned
as PTL leader. Only 14 percent said they would increase their
giving, Clark said.

<HEAD>Bomb Damages School Bus and Injures One Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded today on a
school bus carrying at least a dozen children, injuring a
15-year-old girl and the driver, police said. The outlawed Irish
Republican Army claimed responsibility.
   Several other children sustained minor cuts and bruises and were
treated for shock at a hospital and later released, police said.
   The IRA said in a statement that one of its units was
responsible for the explosion in which a civilian was ``regrettably
injured,'' a tacit acknowledgment that the attack went awry.
   The IRA, which has targeted Northern Ireland's security forces
in its fight to end British rule in the Protestant-dominated
province, said it would hold an investigation into the bombing,
   Police say the driver, a part-time member of the locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment had been targeted by the IRA. He
suffered eye injuries from flying glass in the bombing.
   Gillian Latimer, 15, suffered chest, rib and arm injuries,
police said. She was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in
Belfast where her condition was described as serious.
   At the time of the explosion at 8 a.m., the bus was driving
along Lower Main Street in Lisnaskea in County Fermanagh, 8 miles
from the border of the Irish Republic, said a Belfast police
spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
   The bus was carrying a dozen Protestant and Roman Catholic
children who attend secondary school in Enniskillen, about 10 miles
away, the spokesman said.
   The bomb, made of between 2 and 3 pounds of explosive, was
planted in the engine compartment of the vehicle, the spokesman
said.
   ``We have no idea how it was detonated,'' he added.
   The explosion caused extensive damage to the front of the bus,
the spokesman said.
   Enniskillen, the largest town in Country Fermanagh, was the
scene of an IRA bombing last November that killed 12 Protestants
attending a memorial service for Britain's war dead.
   Ken McFarlane, superintendent of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
in County Fermanagh, denounced ``the crazy recklessness of
terrorists'' who ``have no regard whatsoever for life, even the
lives of children.''
   ``What has happened is terrible in itself, but what might have
happened, for all the terrorists care, is appalling,'' he said.

<HEAD>Recommendations unveiled on Navy Dumping of Trash at Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint committee of the Navy and
environmental groups today unveiled recommendations on how the Navy
can stop dumping plastic trash at sea.
   The Navy has begun carrying out some of the recommendations. For
instance, a contract to buy 11 million small plastic bags for use
by ships' stores has been canceled, said the report of the group
led by the Keystone Center, an organization based in Keystone,
Colo. that mediates environmental disputes.
   Under legislation passed late last year to carry out an
international treaty, the Navy is supposed to stop dumping plastic
trash at sea in five years.
   Environmentalists see plastics as a growing killer of birds and
other marine life. Non-degradable bags, six-pack loops and other
plastics can entangle birds or be eaten by them and other organisms.
   The committee of Navy personnel, environmentalists and members
of congressional staffs was convened last October and immediately
started visiting ships, including an aircraft carrier in the
Mediterranean.
   The recommendations call for, among other things, studies to
identify food for which packaging other than plastic is available,
surveying waste of ships at sea and ordering test packages of other
materials, changing to those materials where possible, installing
trash compactors, separation and storage of plastics while at sea,
unloading as much trash as possible before leaving port and support
for development of degradable packages.
   Navy ships bring trash back to port if operating less than 25
miles from shore, but throw it overboard when further out to sea.
   The Navy is supposed to report to Congress in three years on
what problems it has in eliminating plastic trash.

   Rescuers used a crane and dug with their
hands today to save a 3-year-old boy from the rubble of a house
that police said had been deliberately filled with natural gas and
then ignited, killing two people and injuring eight others.
   The boy was found about ``10 feet under the rubble in what was
apparently the first floor,'' said Deputy Fire Commissioner Roger
Ulshafer. He had been there for about nine hours.
   The child ``didn't seem to be burned too badly. He was breathing
on his own after firefighters gave him mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation,'' Ulshafer said. ``It's overwhelming, getting that
little boy out easily.''
   The boy, identified as Harry Mertz, was taken to a nearby
hospital, where he was listed in guarded condition with burns over
11 percent of his body.
   The body of the man who caused the explosion, identified by
police Capt. James Powell as Richard Litostansky, was found in the
basement.
   ``Friends and neighbors have said he threatened suicide. For the
past several weeks whe's been talking it up pretty good. Apparently
he was in the basement, opened the gas line and blew it,'' said
Detective Mike Boyle.
   A man called the 911 emergency telephone number Monday saying he
had turned on the gas to the two-story rowhouse and planned to
ignite it, said Detective Robert McGarry.
   He demanded to speak to a police officer, but no officer was
available, McGarry said.
   Two of the injured were officers who were investigating the
telephone threat when the house exploded. They had called the
Philadelphia Gas Works to turn off the gas, police said.
   The gas company cut off the lines shortly after midnight, said
Avrom Steinbrook, the utility's manager of public relations.
   The gas-filled house and another next door collapsed, McGarry
said.
   An 82-year-old man was pronounced dead at Episcopal Hospital,
where three of the injured were also taken.
   One officer was in stable condition with head trauma and the
second officer was treated and released, said Episcopal nursing
supervisor Linda Keyte. A man who Ms. Keyte said was apparently the
step-father of the 3-year-old boy and two other children who were
injured suffered chest injuries.
   A 4-year-old girl was in stable condition for smoke inhalation
and her 8-year-old half-brother was in serious condition with
second-degree burns over 20 percent of his body at St.
Christopher's Hospital for Children, said nursing supervisor D.
Volker.
   Two elderly women were also treated and released from St. Mary's
Hospital.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: and locally.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We have witnessed many respectable and able leaders exhaust
their potential after serving in the same office for decades and
become a dead weight, a liability while still occupying a
high-level position. ...
   Direct representation of the civic organizations incorporated
into our political system should be added to the currently existing
territorial representation of the entire population on the Soviet
of the Union and the representation of our nations and
nationalities on the Soviet of Nationalities. ...
   Thus 1,500 deputies would be elected, as they are now, from the
territorial and national districts, and approximately another 750
deputies would be elected at the congresses or at plenary sessions
of the governing bodies of party, trade union, cooperative, youth,
women's, veterans', academic and artistic organizations. ...
   All these deputies, elected for a five-year term, would comprise
a new representative supreme government body _ the Congress of the
U.S.S.R. People's Deputies. It would be convened annually to decide
on the country's more important constitutional, political and
socio-economic issues.
   The Congress of People's Deputies would elect from among its
members a relatively small (say 400 to 450 strong) bicameral
U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet which would consider and decide all
legislative, administrative and monitoring questions and direct the
activities of the bodies accountable to it and of the lower-level
Soviets. It would be a standing supreme government body reporting
to the Congress of People's Deputies. ...
   In the opinion of the CPSU Central Committee, establishing the
post of president of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet would be in line
with enhancing the role played by the supreme representative bodies
and by the entire system of the Soviets of People's Deputies,
strengthing the rule-of-law basis of government and improving the
representation of the Soviet Union in world affairs.
   It should be ruled that the president shall be elected and
recalled by secret ballot by, and be fully answerable and
accountable to, the Congress of the U.S.S.R. People's Deputies.
Given the overall strengthening of the role played by
representative bodies, the President of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
should be granted sufficiently broad state authority powers.
   Specifically, the president could excercise overall guidance in
the drafting of legislation and of major socio-economic programs,
decide on the key issues of foreign policy, defense and national
security, chair the defense council, submit proposals on nominating
the chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, and discharge
several other duties traditionally connected with the presidency.
...
   We may, of course, fail to achieve full unanimity in
decision-making on this or that issue. But that is perfectly normal
under a democratic process. Generally, it is high time we learned
to listen closely to what an opponent is saying and not to regard
him with invariable prejudice. ...
   We should resort much more often to a public vote at the
village, district or city level, particularly in deciding those
issues which are of direct concern to the people and on which there
is not unanimity. If that is the case, let some of the problems be
decided by a majority.''
   _On the legal system:
   ``Not a single government body, official, collective, party
organization, civic association or individual can be exempt from
abiding by the law. Just as all citizens have obligations to our
state of the whole people, the state has obligations to its
citizens. Their rights must be firmly protected against any abuse
by the authorities.''
   _On the Communist Party:
   ``Why did the CPSU, which had been formed as a truly democratic
organization, one bone and one flesh with the working people, fail
to block the deformation of socialism, the processes associated
with the cult of Stalin's personality? Why then having exposed and
denounced the departures from the principles of Leninism, did it
confine itself to superficial changes which made possible the grave
phenomena of stagnation in the country's development?
   The answer is above all in the fact that definite deformations
had occurred in the party itself, in its activities and its ties
with the working people, which brought about the loss of many
demoractic Bolshevist traditions, traditions founded through the
efforts exerted by Lenin and his associates for many years. ...
   The majority strongly favor the proposal that Communists be
entitled, in elections to all party committees, including the CPSU
Central Commmittee, to nominate more candidates than there are
seats and to be guided, in doing so, not by the office a person
holds, but by his stance in perestroika.''
   _On socialism's new image:
   ``There can be no full-blooded and diverse life of the spirit,
there can be no truly effective and militant ideological work,
without the truth of life, without scientific truths and artistic
discoveries. ...
   It is exceedingly undemocratic to deny people who had been
subjected to criticism a chance to reply to that criticism in
substance. That is not glasnost. And it is totally impermissible to
use discussions, meetings, the press, and the television screen for
squabbles or insults and for name-calling. ...
   Our aims are more democracy, more socialism, a better life for
the workingman, and greatness and well-being for the country.''

<HEAD>Kirkpatrick to Speak at GOP Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Kirkpatrick announcement in top 4 grafs, picking

<TEXT>
   Republican officials said today, one day after the Democrats
named Texan Ann Richards as their convention keynote speaker, that
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick would be ``one of the featured speakers'' at
the GOP convention in August.
   Meanwhile, George Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, was traveling to California today to visit a NASA research
center and a neighborhood safety program. Democrat Michael Dukakis
was touting his Massachusetts record on housing issues before
focusing again on the search for a running mate.
   The Republicans announced the convention role for Ms.
Kirkpatrick, a favorite of conservatives, after the Democrats said
they had chosen Texas State Treasurer Richards, a fiery populist
orator, to deliver the keynote speech and ``set the tone'' for the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next month.
   Ms. Kirkpatrick, a former Democrat, gave a widely publicized
speech attacking the Democrats at the 1984 Republican convention.
Republican Party chief Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said the
announcement of the keynote speaker for the New Orleans meeting
would probably come in the next ten days.
   Ms. Richards, 54, will be the second woman in party history to
deliver the convention-opening address.
   Today, in an interview on CBS-TV, she mentioned fellow Texan
Barbara Jordan's keynote speech in 1976 and added, ``That year the
Democrats went to the White House so maybe they saw my selection,
having another female, as a good omen.''
   Ms. Richards said she would consult with advisers to Jesse
Jackson as well as Dukakis before preparing her speech. ``I welcome
any help and any advice that I get,'' she said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, says he is weighing which of a dozen issues
left out of the party platform to bring up at convention. His
comments came after Democrats, meeting in Denver and Washington
over the weekend, agreed to a platform draft and an overhaul of
party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity.
   Jackson was part of the sellout crowd of 21,785 in Atlantic
City, N.J., who watched Mike Tyson knock out Michael Spinks in the
first round and retain the undisputed heavyweight crown.
   Dukakis will travel on Wednesday to Washington to meet with
several dozen senators, including some who have been mentioned as
possible running mates.
   Among them is Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, although he said Monday he
was not providing the Dukakis campaign with background and
financial information it has requested of prospective running mates.
   Nunn said he had told Dukakis and campaign chairman Paul
Brountas that a spot on the Democratic ticket is ``not on my
agenda.'' Brountas is heading the search for a running mate.
   Another prominent senator, New Jersey's Bill Bradley, last week
said he had informed Dukakis that he did not want to be considered.
And the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today, citing
unidentified sources, that House Majority Leader Tom Foley, who has
said frequently that he doesn't want to be vice president, had
chosen not to have Dukakis' aides examine his personal background
and finances.
   Those under consideration, according to sources, include
Jackson, Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, Nunn, John Glenn of Ohio, and
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and Reps. Foley of Washington and Lee
Hamilton of Indiana.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
also reportedly have been asked to provide information to Brountas.
   Aides said there was no timetable for making or announcing the
choice for he second spot on the ticket.
   Jackson has continued to talk about his own qualifications as a
running mate for Dukakis. And although he says he's happy with
parts of the platform, he is indicating that some points of
disagreement will be brought up at the convention.
   ``By and large, we got many of our campaign priorities in the
platform,'' Jackson said Monday. But he noted that his forces had
``protected our right to ... protest or raise other issues in
Atlanta.''
   One of those issues might be a call for the creation of a
Palestinian homeland _ rejected by the Dukakis forces for inclusion
in the platform.
   ``Reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienate
anyone,'' Jackson said in Rosemont, Ill.
   In announcing the selection of Ms. Richards as the keynote
speaker for the Democrats, party chief Paul G. Kirk said she would
``set the tone for Democrats in Atlanta and... draw the
distinctions between the party of the working American people and
the party of the establishment.''
   In Texas, Ms. Richards, the divorced mother of four grown
children, said: ``I probably will be talking very much about
American families. I think that's what I know the most about, other
than my professional job.''
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep. Norman Mineta of
California, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and Little Rock,
Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.
   Bush met Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
Washington amid more bad news in the polls.

   Police arrested 13 black ministers and civil
rights leaders today after they refused to leave Toledo City
Council chambers during a protest over the suspension of three city
workers.
   Some of those who were arrested were dragged or carried out of
the chambers while an estimated 300 people in the room prayed and
asked for an explanation of the suspensions.
   Police said 13 of those arrested were charged with disrupting a
lawful meeting and criminal trespassing. They included Lee
Williams, head of the Northwest Ohio chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   The group had occupied council chambers at about 9 a.m. City
Council members waited to start their meeting, then asked police to
arrest the demonstrators.
   The group was protesting the suspension of three black employees
of the city's Community Development Department three weeks ago
after a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
investigation revealed deficiencies in Toledo's housing
rehabilitation program.
   A spokesman for the group, the Rev. Franklin Freeman, said
shortly before his arrest, ``We will not leave. They haven't
listened to us. It isn't a democracy when you don't listen to the
people.''
   Those who were arrested were released on their own recognizance
after being booked.
   The Rev. Floyd Rose, executive director of the Coalition for
Economic Justice, said after his release, ``We will not stop. The
city has to address the issue.''
   The problems in the Toledo program include double-billing for
some improvements and failure of houses to meet city codes after
being rehabilitated. The three workers in the city community
development department were suspended pending an investigation, but
no charges have been filed in the cases.
   Freeman said moments before his arrest that he wants a council
committee to hear what the three suspended workers have to say
about the allegations and that he has requested a federal
investigation into the way City Manager Phillip Hawkey handled the
suspensions.

<HEAD>How to Squeeze 35,000 Credentialed Bodies into Space for 11,000</HEAD>

   The Democratic National Convention Committee
hopes it can peacefully resolve the problem of fitting 35,000
credential-bearing people into a coliseum that will seat only
11,000 for the party's four-day nominating session.
   Logistically, the solution is simple _ the overflow from the
Omni Coliseum will go into the adjacent World Congress Center. But
it may not be so simple to soothe the hurt feelings of party
hotshots who find themselves relegated to watching the proceedings
on giant television screens next door.
   ``We'll have fewer spectator seats in the Omni, and there are
going to be people who are disappointed they aren't going to be in
the Omni,'' said Ruth Berry, press secretary for the DNCC, which is
in charge of organizing the July 18-21 extravaganza.
   The Omni, which seats more than 16,000 for the NBA Atlanta Hawks
games, is being redesigned for the convention, cutting down the
seating to about 11,000. The architectural changes include a podium
and news media facilitiies.
   Among the horde of 35,000 will be about 15,000 representatives
of the news media and 5,000-plus delegates and alternates. The
remainder will be made up of invited guests, pages, messengers,
security.
   Credentials, the color-coded badges that spell entree to the
gathering, will be issued to the media, delegates and alternates,
invited guests, pages, messengers, security, state governors and
lieutenant governors, members of Congress, Democratic staff,
officers of the convention and service workers.
   Mayor Andrew Young admitted there may be problems accommodating
all 35,000 people, but with minor adjustments they can be resolved.
   ``We didn't design the city for the Democratic National
Convention. We did design the city for most conventions,'' Young
said. ``But when you come with as many press people as delegates,
you've got to make some adjustments.''
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk said, ``We knew there
would be limited space. But it is adequate to accommodate all the
delegates and additional guests. It will be a little difficult for
the media. This is not a sprawling complex (The Omni), but it's not
a theater in the round.''
   Ms. Berry said there are seven levels of credentials,
color-coded to indicate access. Some credentials will get the
bearer into everything; others are severely limited. She would not
divulge the color breakdown.
   ``Each credential will have an access level that is appropriate
to the function of the credential holder,'' she said.

   Six cases of explosives intended for
Forest Lake's Fourth of July celebration were stolen from a
warehouse, authorities said.
   ``We hope to get them back, but we hope they didn't fall into
the wrong hands. Any hands are the wrong hands, but we just hope
they aren't kids,'' said Larry Kiefat of the Forest Lake American
Legion Post, who is in charge of the celebration.
   The explosives are worth about $3,500, he said.
   ``I usually store them somewhere else, locked up where nobody
knows where they are,'' Kiefat said.
   He said he ordered new fireworks from Appleton, S.D., hoping
they will arrive in time.
   Police Sgt. Mike Aschenbrener said it appears thieves broke in
through a back door.
   ``We've got one witness lead we're working on, but nothing
concrete yet,'' Aschenbrener said. ``We're hoping that anyone with
information will contact the Forest Lake police. Anybody setting
them off without proper training could be seriously injured.''

   Two cosmonauts who have been aboard the Mir

   It will be the first space walk for pilot Vladimir Titov and
flight engineer Musa Manarov, who have been in space since Dec. 21,
1987.
   The official radio said ground control had reached the
conclusion the cosmonauts were ready to walk in space, and ``on
Thursday they will repair a telescope.'' It provided no other
details of the space walk.
   Manarov and Titov replaced Alexander Alexandrov and Yuri
Romanenko, who has been in space longer than anyone else: 326 days.
Soviet officials have said the flight by Manarov and Titov will
last about a year, possibly breaking Romanenko's endurance record.
   On June 9, a joint Soviet-Bulgarian crew on a 10-day missioin
docked with the Mir space station.

<TEXT>
   State Rep. Thomas Reed, the head of the
state NAACP, pleaded innocent to federal bribery and extortion
charges today, denying he accepted cash and restaurant equipment to
help a convicted murderer get out of prison.
   Reed had no comment after his arraignment before U.S. District
Judge Myron Thompson, but attorney George Beck said Reed is ``going
to prove he's not guilty.''
   Thompson set trial for Aug. 8 before U.S. District Judge Joel
Dubina. He gave the legislator's attorneys 10 days to file papers
challenging the government's case.
   Reed is accused of accepting at least $15,000 in cash and
restaurant equipment to try to secure the early release of a
convicted murderer from the state parole board. He also has been
indicted on related state felony charges, with arraignment pending.
   Reed broke the color barrier in the Alabama Legislature in 1970,
later helped win state trooper jobs for blacks and recently made a
high-profile bid to remove the Confederate flag from atop the
Capitol.
   One of Reed's lawyers is Bill Baxley, a former Alabama attorney
general who unsuccessfully prosecuted Reed on bribery charges more
than 10 years ago. Baxley said he had no qualms about representing
Reed in the pending case.
   Reed, a Tuskegee businessman who operates two fried chicken
restaurants, is one of the first two blacks elected to the
Legislature since Reconstruction. ``He's a pioneer in that
progressive political process made by blacks in the early 1970s,''
says Tuskegee Mayor Johnny Ford. ``He was a role model and a great
inspiration to many.''
   As head of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People chapter, Reed has moved to the center of controversy
in the Confederate battle-flag dispute.
   The NAACP says the flag represents racism and oppression. It
mounted a campaign last year to remove the banner from state
capitols here and in South Carolina and from state flags in Georgia
and Mississippi.
   Reed vowed to try to remove the flag himself from atop the
building in which Jefferson Davis was sworn in as president of the
Confederacy in 1861 if Republican Gov. Guy Hunt would not.
   In February, Reed was among 14 black legislators arrested when
they made a symbolic attempt to scale a fence that surrounds the
Capitol.
   The demonstration led many to criticize Reed for his tactics.
   ``I was out speaking to different groups about the pressing
problems of the state and all anybody wanted to talk about was the
flag,'' said House Speaker Jimmy Clark. ``I'm not much on issues
that attract public attention but are really not that serious.''
   Attorneys for the 14 legislators maintain that the misdemeanor
trespass charges they face should be dropped. Meanwhile, the flag
still flies atop the Capitol.
   A few weeks before the aborted climb, Reed told a rally that God
allowed former Gov. George C. Wallace to survive an assassination
attempt so Wallace could suffer as ``a message to whites.''
   The comment prompted some local NAACP leaders to say Reed should
be removed as state president. Reed later apologized to Wallace.
   When Reed was indicted, some blacks suggested the charges were
related to the flag dispute.
   Reed has not alleged a direct link, but said Monday that ``it is
difficult for me to believe that there is no connection there.''
   In 1977, Reed was convicted of offering a bribe to a white
lawmaker who opposed Reed's efforts to gain approval for a dog
track in rural, mostly black Macon County. The misdemeanor
conviction was overturned by the state Supreme Court, and Reed was
able to maintain his legislative seat. The track later was approved.
   In 1970, Reed and Fred Gray became the first two blacks elected
to the Legislature this century, after a court-ordered
reapportionment created two mostly black House districts.
   Two years later, Reed sued the state because it had never hired
a black state trooper. Blacks now make up about a fourth of the
trooper ranks.
   The state and federal charges allege that Reed, a member of the
Legislature's Joint Prison Committee, accepted at least $10,000 in
cash and $5,000 in restaurant equipment from an uncle of convicted
murderer Anthony Dennis Chesser.
   In return, Reed allegedly attempted to use his position to
persuade the parole board to give Chesser an earlier date for
parole consideration and a work-release assignment.
   Chesser, serving a 40-year sentence, initially was given an
earlier date for parole consideration at Reed's request, but the
parole board later revoked that change and refused Reed's request
to give Chesser a work-release assignment.
   On June 16, a federal grand jury in Montgomery indicted Reed on
two counts of violating the Hobbs Act through extortion and three
counts of violating the Interstate Travel Act to obtain the $10,000
in cash. Reed faces up to 55 years in prison and up to $1.25
million in fines if convicted.
   A Montgomery County grand jury indicted Reed on two related
felony bribery counts June 20, each carrying a penalty of 1-to-10
years in prison and a $5,000 fine. His arraignment on these charges
is pending.
   Reed has remained free on bond.

   Yugoslavia has decided to close down
the only railway line linking Albania with the outside world, the
Tanjug news agency reported Tuesday.
   The line between Titograd in Yugoslavia and Shkoder in Albania
was opened in 1986 and was the first to link that isolated Balkan
country with European rail networks.
   Tanjug quoted rail officials as saying the line, used mainly by
Albanians for imports and exports of goods, proved unprofitable for
Yugoslavia.
   Last year, only 139,000 tons of goods were transported on the
line, even though its full capacity could be 1 million tons
annually, the Yugoslav officials said.
   The start-up of the rail link was considered as a sign of
warming political relations between Yugoslavia and Albania, and
also of Albania's gradual opening to the world.

   Two gunmen opened fire in a crowded

people and sending panicked shoppers scrambling for cover,
authorities said.
   The three victims were waiting on customers at a clothes booth
when the gunmen pushed through the crowd and began shooting, police
said. His motive was not known.
   Giuseppe Lo Jacono, 15, and Giuseppe Cina, 28, died at the
scene. Another victim, Enrico Calandra, 23, died en route to the
hospital.
   No passers-by were injured in the shooting, but many ran
screaming into nearby shops or hid behind parked cars, authorities
said. The open-air market is held every Tuesday in a largely
residential area.
   The gunmen escaped on a motorscooter, which police later found
abandoned and burned on a nearby street.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New plays by Harold Pinter and David Mamet as well
as Shakespeare's ``Hamlet'' are among the highlights of the
National Theater's upcoming 1988-89 season.
   ``I couldn't possibly be more enthusiastic or optimistic about
our artistic future,'' said Richard Eyre, the new artistic director
of the three-theater complex on London's south bank.
   The 45 year-old director, whose production of the musical ``Guys
and Dolls'' was one of the National's greatest successes, begins
his five-year contract on Sept. 1, succeeding Sir Peter Hall as
head of one of Britain's two leading government-subsidized theaters.
   Of principal interest in the National's upcoming roster are the
world premieres of new plays by Pinter and David Hare, two leading
contemporary British playwrights.
   Michael Gambon, currently starring in a commercial production of
Anton Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya,'' will star in Pinter's ``Mountain
Language,'' a 20-minute play opening October 20. The work marks the
first stage piece in four years from the author of such
acknowledged modern masterworks as ``The Birthday Party,'' ``The
Homecoming'' and ``Betrayal.''
   Hare, whose plays ``Plenty'' and ``A Map of the World'' were
successful in New York, will open his new show, ``The Secret
Rapture,'' on October 4.
   January will see the British premiere of Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow,'' directed by Gregory Mosher, who staged the hit
production currently on Broadway.
   Star watchers will keep an eye out next March for Eyre's own
production of ``Hamlet,'' which marks the return to the National
after three years of Daniel Day Lewis, the gifted young star of the
films, ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``The Unbearable Lightness
of Being.''
   Dame Judi Dench will play Gertrude to his tortured Danish
prince. The Shakespeare play links Eyre's regime to his
predecessors, Hall and Laurence Olivier, each of whom directed
``Hamlet'' during his first year as artistic director.
   Other plays on the horizon are ``Indivisibles,'' a Tony Harrison
play due next spring to feature opera star Teresa Stratas; the
British bow of Joshua Sobol's ``Ghetto,'' set in a Jewish ghetto in
Lithuania; and a new adaptation by novelist Angela Carter of Frank
Wedekind's seminal 19th-century piece, ``Lulu.''
   Eyre, who announced the new lineup at a news conference on
Tuesday, has directed on and off at the National over the past six
years. His new production of the 1622 tragedy, ``The Changeling,''
starring Miranda Richardson (``Empire of the Sun''), opened to
mixed reviews June 23.
   Hall, whose 15-year tenure at the National has been marked by
stormy disputes and some outstanding productions, is stepping down
to head up his own commercial production company. That company
debuts next December with a revival of Tennessee Williams'
``Orpheus Descending,'' starring Vanessa Redgrave.

   Two 911 operators were suspended with pay for
chatting with each other instead of answering emergency telephone
calls, police said.
   ``Throughout the course of these conversations, incoming 911
emergency phones could be heard ringing in the background,'' their
letters of reprimand said.
   Police spokesman Sam Harlan said no emergency calls went
unattended. ``Other people just had to to do the work they weren't
doing,'' he said.
   The women were suspended last weekend pending a decision by
Chief Clarence Dickson on their punishment. The investigation began
after a co-worker saw the women using an interoffice intercom line
for an unusually long time.
   The women said they handled incoming calls while talking to each
other. One blamed a supervisor who she said dislikes her.
   The women, five-year veterans, are seeking help from their
union, saying other emergency operators also chatted on the
intercom system.

   A hunter was gored to death by a fatally

Tuesday.
   Clive Swemmer died en route to a hospital in the town of Kariba,
according to friends, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He was hunting in the Zambezi Valley bordering Zambia on Friday
when a friend accompanying him shot and wounded the buffalo.
   Swemmer plunged into thick bush after the injured and angered
animal to put it out of its misery, the friends said. The buffalo
apparently turned on him and gored him before it died beside him.
   Swemmer, winner of the 1982 Zimbabwe Tobacco Grower of the Year
Award, farmed in the Macheke area about 60 miles from the Zimbabwe
capital of Harare.
   A state National Parks and Wildlife Management Department
spokesman official cautioned hunters against pursuing wounded
buffalo, saying: ``It's well know that they conceal themselves in
the bush and lie in wait to ambush the hunter, very often with
fatal results.''

<TEXT>
   The launch of Discovery on the first
space shuttle mission since the Challenger disaster has been
officially delayed several days until Sept. 4, NASA said Tuesday.
   An announcement from space agency headquarters in Washington
confirmed what many launch site officials have been saying for some
time, that an August launch was impossible because it is taking
longer than expected to prepare Discovery for flight.
   The announcement said the new goal is a launch in early
September. Astronaut Jon McBride, NASA's liaison with Congress,
told a meeting in Washington the target is Sept. 4.
   The delay was the third announced this year, with earlier launch
dates set in February, June and August. But, one by one, they have
fallen by the wayside as technical problems held up the nation's
recovery from the loss of space shuttle Challenger and its seven
crew members in a fiery explosion 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan.
28, 1986.
   For several weeks, the space agency has carried Aug. 22 as a
public target for launch, but that was wiped out unofficially some
time ago.
   More than a week ago the assessment date was Sept. 3 and over
last weekend it was changed to Sept. 4. Both were reported by the
news media as working dates.
   The announcement Tuesday officially eliminated an August date, a
goal that some officials said was still possible as recently as
last week.
   Engineers this week have encountered minor problems in joining
Discovery with its two 149-foot solid fuel booster rockets and
external fuel tank, and the vehicle's rollout to the launch pad has
been put off from Friday until Sunday.
   In making the announcement, Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly, NASA's
associate administrator for space flight, said that despite the new
delay, he is pleased with the progress of preparations for the
flight.
   ``Hard work by a lot of people is paying off and the shuttle
program is coming along nicely,'' Truly said.
   McBride, who flew on a shuttle mission in 1984, said Discovery's
three main engines will undergo a test-firing on the launch pad
here on July 24, to be followed the next day by a fifth fullscale
test-firing of a redesigned solid fuel booster rocket at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah.
   A faulty booster rocket joint that allowed gas and flames to
escape was blamed for the Challenger accident.
   McBridge said a flight readiness review involving all key
shuttle managers will be held Aug. 16.

   The self-proclaimed surveillance expert who
claimed to have recorded conversations between Tawana Brawley's
advisers but turned over blank tapes to federal authorities was
ordered held without bail today.
   Meanwhile, a poll released today shows a majority of New Yorkers
say the teen-agers advisers have acted irresponsibly.
   Samuel McClease, 26, of Jersey City, N.J., said last week he had
taped conversations between the Rev. Al Sharpton and two legal
advisers concerning the Brawley family in which they cast doubt on
the black teen-ager's accusation that she was raped by six whites
last November.
   But McClease was charged Saturday with one count each of
obstruction of justice and perjury after it was revealed the tapes
he submitted were blank.
   U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram said she had heard nothing
during arguments that ``would assure his reappearance in court.
Therefore I am going to direct that Mr. McClease be detained.''
   McClease's father, Dennis McClease Sr., told reporters he would
retain lawyer Barry Slotnick on his son's behalf and would file an
appeal of the bail ruling.
   At a hearing Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Federico E. Virella
claimed that the maximum five-year sentence and $250,000 fine
McClease faces if convicted of perjury and obstructing justice,
coupled with his checkered military and employment records, made
him a poor candidate for release on bail.
   But Magistrate James Francis IV disagreed and ordered McClease
released on $100,000 unsecured bond. Prosecutors appealed the
ruling to Kram.
   McClease said during an interview broadcast June 20 on WCBS-TV
that Sharpton hired him to plant voice-activated listening devices
in the home and office of Brawley attorney C. Vernon Mason and in
Sharpton's own home.
   In the televised interview, McClease said the tapes revealed
that there was no evidence to support the teen-ager's allegations,
and that the advisers knew this.
   ``He continues playing a game with the grand jury,'' Virella
told the magistrate, adding that McClease had evaded appearing
before the grand jury until he was granted immunity concerning the
tapes.
   Virella did not say if the tapes existed, only that the tapes
turned over last week were blank.
   McClease's attorney, Leonard Joy, said the move to detain
McClease was an example of the ``annoyance and vindictiveness of
the government.''
   The poll, meanwhile, shows a majority of New Yorkers say Miss
Brawley's advisers have acted irresponsibly in their handling of
the case.
   In New York City, 55 percent of black respondents and 84 percent
of whites surveyed also said that Sharpton along with attorneys
Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. are using her case for their personal
advantages, according to The New York Times-WCBS-TV News Poll.
   Among city blacks surveyed, 62 percent said Miss Brawley's
advisers had acted irresponsibly, while 17 percent said they had
not. The remainder said they didn't know or declined to answer.
   Among whites surveyed in the city, 83 percent said the advisers
had been irresponsible; 5 percent disagreed.
   The telephone poll of 1,131 adults _ 676 in New York City and
455 in the Wappingers Falls, Poughkeepsie and Newburgh area _ was
conducted between Tuesday and Saturday. The margin of error was
plus or minus 4 percentage points for New York City, plus or minus
5 percentage points in the Wappingers Falls area and plus or minus
6 percentage points for whites or blacks in the city.

   A former CIA official pleaded innocent Tuesday
to charges he conspired illegally to arm the Contra rebels and then
asserted through his lawyer that he was only following President
Reagan's policies.
   After Joseph F. Fernandez, 51, the agency's former station chief
in Costa Rica, entered his plea in U.S. District Court, his
attorney said he had committed no crime and that his indictment
sends a ``chilling message'' to the nation's intelligence agents.
   The message tells agents that ``Should you become enmeshed in
activities ... involving policies where there may be an absence of
political harmony at home, you may find yourselves upon your return
to the United States the targets of criminal prosecutions,''
defense attorney Thomas E. Wilson said in a statement to reporters.
   ``Throughout the time Mr. Fernandez served in Costa Rica, his
actions were entirely consistent with United States law and with
the declared policies of the president of the United States,''
Wilson said.
   Fernandez, who left the CIA last year, stood in U.S. District
Court when U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. asked for his
plea.
   ``Your Honor, I plead not guilty,'' the bespectacled defendant
said in a loud, firm voice.
   Fernandez was released on his own recognizance. Outside the
courthouse, a dozen demonstrators carried signs, one of which
called Fernandez ``an American hero.''
   Law enforcement officials have said Fernandez is the first
former CIA station chief to be indicted in connection with his
duties.
   Wilson said the charges ``relate exclusively to his conduct in
his official capacity as CIA's chief of station in San Jose, Costa
Rica, between 1984 and 1986. As such, the indictment is a first in
the history of the United States.''
   The attorney called the indictment ``a tragedy for Joe
Fernandez, for his wife, Dale, and for their seven children. It is
a tragedy for CIA; and, in the largest sense, it is a tragedy for
this nation.''
   Fernandez is accused of participating in an illegal conspiracy
to arm the Nicaraguan rebels. He is named in a five-count
indictment charging that he and unidentified co-conspirators
``deceitfully and without legal authorization'' organized a private
arms supply network for the Contras when Congress banned such aid.
He also is charged with lying to his superiors to conceal the
operation.
   Fernandez also is accused of obstructing an investigation of the
sale of U.S. weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits to the
Contras that was conducted by the presidential commission headed by
former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas.
   The indictment says Fernandez lied to the Tower commission last
year by stating that he did not know for a fact that fired National
Security Council aide Oliver L. North was involved in aiding the
Contras.
   Each of the charges carries a maximum sentence of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The charges are the latest stemming from the Iran-Contra affair.
Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the case,
already has charged North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord with
conspiring to divert profits from the arms sales illegally to the
Contras.
   President Reagan has said he knew nothing about the diversion,
but testimony before congressional panels last year suggested that
William J. Casey, the CIA director at the time, was aware of the
scheme.
   Laurence Shtasel, associate independent counsel, told reporters
outside court he could not comment on Casey's role in the affair or
whether other CIA officials face indictment.
   Fernandez, who operated in the field under the cover name Tomas
Castillo, is accused of overseeing the construction of an airstrip
in northern Costa Rica that the conspiracy built to help deliver
arms to the rebels.
   The indictment charges that Fernandez lied to his superiors
about the purpose of the airstrip and sent incomplete and
unresponsive cables to the agency designed to conceal the operation
after a C-123K cargo plane carrying weapons for the Contras was
shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986, the indictment says.
   Fernandez told the congressional Iran-Contra committees that the
operations were authorized by CIA officials. But he admitted he
misled both the Tower commission and the CIA's inspector general,
actions he said he thought were ``within the guidelines'' set by
Clair George, then the agency's deputy director for operations.
   Fernandez was one of several CIA officers disciplined by CIA
Director William Webster last year.

   Soviet citizens were alerted by their leader
Tuesday that price increases may be in store, along with a change
in the way farmland is managed, as part of his efforts to solve
chronic food shortages.
   In a speech to a national Communist Party conference at the
Kremlin, Mikhail S. Gorbachev said it is necessary to revamp the
state-controlled pricing system to bring about ``the swiftest
possible saturation of the market with food products.''
   ``Without price reform, we will not be able to achieve concrete
results in the economy,'' he said.
   Gorbachev, who said last year that bread was so cheap in the
Soviet Union that children used loaves to play soocer, said it was
``not a normal situation'' to continue paying out the massive
government subsidies that keep down the price of food.
   ``It is absolutely necessary to solve this problem no matter how
difficult this may be,'' Gorbachev said, without suggesting a date
for the implementation of price changes.
   Soviet economists have been talking since at least last year
about possible price reform as part of Gorbachev's program for
``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, and many
Soviets feel price increases on such heavily subsidized staples as
milk, bread and meat are in the offing.
   Gorbachev also said proposals on reform now under ``deep study''
will be put up for nationwide discussion, and that any government
gains as a result of price reform will be handed back in full to
the populace. He did not say how that would be done.
   Gorbachev, the son of a Russian peasant who once was the party's
chief for agriculture, said it was also necessary to change the way
work is conducted on the vast network of state and collective
farms, which are a perennial sore spot in the Soviet economy.
   ``Everything depends on how quickly we will make people
interested and organize the work of collectives on the basis of
lease and contract, on how extensively we will draw the workers in
agriculture into this process and make the farmer a genuine
master,'' he said.
   Gorbachev did not propose an end to state farms, where farmers
have traditionally received a salary similar to those who work in
factories or offices. But he called for a nationwide program to
permit families to lease farmland from their collectives and till
the soil themselves, which he said experiments had shown resulted
in dramatically bigger crops.

   A plant worker mixing chemicals apparently
released a poisonous gas that killed four people and left 20 others
injured today at a northeast Indiana plating company, officials
said.
   ``It appears like somebody _ a worker _ was mixing a couple of
chemicals and cyanide gas resulted, and he or she dropped. And then
somebody came in to help, and he dropped. It was like a domino
effect,'' Lt. Ken Hollingsworth of the Indiana state police said.
   Bastian Plating Co. Vice President Dennis Fry said four workers
died and others were taken to DeKalb County Memorial Hospital. He
said the accident occurred at about 5 a.m.
   ``There was no explosion. It was an industrial accident,'' said
a shaken Fry.
   He added that he did not know what chemical was involved or how
many workers were in the plant at the time. About 75 workers are
employed at the factory, which produces electroplated chrome auto
parts.
   Hollingsworth said the accident involved cyanide poisoning and
DeKalb hospital spokeswoman Maryellen Schimmoller said about 20
people were being treated for what she believed was cyanide
poisoning.
   ``We're putting people in quarantine. They're having to be very
careful with what they're handling,'' Ms. Schimmoller said.
   At least one person was transferred to Parkview Memorial
Hospital in Fort Wayne, which is about 15 miles south of Auburn.
   Sheryl Swingley, a spokeswoman for Parkview, said Bastian
employee Craig Fogel of Auburn, whose age was not available, was
unconscious and in very critical condition. She said Fogel was
undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy to try to pump more oxygen
into the tissues of his body to offset exposure to poisonous gas.
   Hollingsworth said an Auburn police officer also was
hospitalized for observation.
   Trooper Bob Corkwell, a member of the state police hazardous
materials team, said the plant had been evacuated during the
accident, but that the area around the plant had not been evacuated.
   ``We don't believe there's a threat of any other contamination
in the area,'' Corkwell said.
   Auburn is a community of about 9,000 residents about 135 miles
east of Chicago.

   A salesman at Moscow's Central Department Store
took the TV set out of its box Tuesday, plugged it in and flicked a
switch. The familiar face of Mikhail S. Gorbachev appeared on the
screen, live and in color.
   The inaugural images were a test not only of the $1,280
Soviet-made set but also, symbolically, of ``perestroika,'' the
restructuring of Soviet society Gorbachev was promoting in the
broadcast from the Kremlin's glass-and-marble Palace of Congresses
a few blocks away.
   The televisions for sale at the downtown store are among the
consumer products Gorbachev complained the Soviet Union doesn't
produce enough of or make good enough.
   When Gorbachev began his address at 10:15 a.m., about 50 Soviets
crowded around a dozen sets on display. Most, however, quickly lost
interest, and their number dwindled to six. One who stayed was
Gennady N. Sasnovsky, a 26-year-old construction engineer who was
passing the time while his wife shopped elsewhere.
   ``We have problems up to here,'' said Sasnovsky, drawing his
hand across his throat.
   The chief concerns, he said, involve economics _ a topic to
which Gorbachev devoted much of the first two hours of his address
to the 5,000 delegates to the nationwide Communist Party conference.
   ``The tragedy is that the working man lives worse than he who
sits behind a desk,'' said Sasnovsky.
   In his speech, Gorbachev attacked the party and government for
what he said was its reluctance to reward good workers with higher
pay and punish bad workers with wage reductions.
   Some changes are already being made. Sasnovsky said the
construction enterprise where he works recently began operating
under the self-financing system Gorbachev has implemented and that
he now is eligible for bonuses of up to 40 percent of his monthly
salary if he does a good job. Sasnovsky said his regular pay is the
equivalent of $305 a month.
   He said Gorbachev's main task is to ``awaken the people. They
aren't used to being active.''
   Asked whether he thought the proposals before this week's party
conference would improve things, he said: ``I think they are not
sufficient. They should be more radical, sharper.''
   As the conference opened, red banners hung from lampposts
throughout downtown, and the stern visage of Vladimir I. Lenin,
founder of the Soviet state, stared down from building-tall
portraits erected for the occasion.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev called today for sweeping
change in the Soviet Union, including creation of a full-time
legislature with real power and election of a president with duties
akin to those of some Western heads of state.
   He also proposed that farmers be made masters of the land in a
program that would allow them to lease the soil they till to
quickly increase production and end chronic food shortages.
   It was not immediately clear how the legislative proposals would
affect the post of Communist Party general secretary, the job that
makes Gorbachev the most powerful man in the country.
   Gorbachev spoke of an elected president of the Supreme Soviet
who would appoint the head of government and oversee foreign and
defense policy.
   Addressing the party's first general conference in nearly a
half-century, Gorbachev also:
   _Called for guaranteeing peoples' right to privacy ostensibly
granted by the 1977 Constitution.
   _Served notice the party would not brook organized challenges to
its authority.
   _Said overhauling the state-run pricing system is ``absolutely
necessary'' to encourage swift saturation of the market with
high-quality foodstuffs. Many Soviets already worry that price
reform will mean drastically increased food prices.
   Hours after Gorbachev spoke, promising freer expression and more
attention to the Soviet Union's more than 100 nationalities, about
200 Crimean Tatars tried to stage a demonstration in downtown
Moscow.
   Police dragged protesters onto buses and took them away after
they unfurled banners demanding a return to the homeland taken away
from them in the 1940s.
   A few blocks away, police dragged away members of a citizens'
group called the Democratic Union, which advocates a multi-party
political system of a sort Gorbachev said Communists could not
tolerate.
   In a 3{-hour televised speech opening the conference, Gorbachev
told the 5,000 delegates that farm policy had to be changed.
   Stopping short of a call for dismantling the Soviet Union's
system of collective farms, the reform-minded Gorbachev urged ``the
extensive, countrywide introduction'' of a program to permit
families to lease farmland from their collective and state farms
and till the soil themselves, rather than as part of salaried farm
brigades.
   Gorbachev also told the 5,000 delegates that reform of state-set
wholesale and retail prices ``is absolutely necessary,'' despite
widespread concern that the cost of food and consumer goods will
increase drastically.
   In a speech occasionally interrupted by brief applause,
Gorbachev told the delegates gathered in the Kremlin's glass and
marble Palace of Congresses that his policy of ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness, does not mean he will tolerate formation of new
political parties that challenge the rule of the Communist Party.
   Nor, he said, should glasnost be abused by those trying to
redraw political boundaries, an obvious reference to Soviet
Armenia's efforts to annex a region belonging to the neighboring
republic of Azerbaijan.
   Rejecting recent calls for more autonomy from delegates
representing the Baltic republics, Gorbachev said, ``Any obsession
with national isolation can only lead to economic and cultural
impoverishment.''
   Gorbachev called for an overhaul of the nation's legislative
system to give the Supreme Soviet and the legislatures of the 15
Soviet republics real power. Now, they generally act as bodies
approving decisions of the Communist Party.
   The Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, would become a
full-time standing body with fewer than a third of its present
1,500 deputies, and members would be elected _ as early as next
spring _ by a new Congress of Deputies.
   The congress would be a new policy-making body similar to the
existing Supreme Soviet but expanded to include representatives of
various workers' and special interest groups.
   Gorbachev's address, broadcast live by Soviet television and
radio, is expected to be the basis for discussion by the party
delegates, who will meet behind closed doors to consider various
resolutions setting party policy.
   Delegates have cautioned against expecting great policy changes
or shifts in the top party elite at the conference, the party's
first since 1941. But they've said the forum would seek to redefine
the role in society of the 20 million-member ruling party.
   Gorbachev also told delegates that price reform, interpreted as
meaning substantial price increases, ``is absolutely necessary''
despite widespread concern prices for food and other goods will
increase drastically.
   The Soviet leader endorsed experiments that let families farm
their own land to increase production.
   ``We must overcome the estrangement between the farmer and the
soil,'' said Gorbachev, himself the son of a Russian peasant and a
former director of Soviet agricultural policy.
   Soviet analysts have said a dramatic improvement in farm
production, which has resisted traditional Communist management
techniques, offers the best chance for quick and noticeable
improvement in the standard of living.
   In the political sphere, Gorbachev said strict demarcation of
functions between the party and government organizations are needed
to ensure the success of his social and economic reforms, known as
``perestroika.''
   One central item on the conference's agenda would limit
Communist officials to two five-year terms in one office.

   The head of a national postal union will
go to trial in August on charges of embezzlement and filing false
union records, officials said Tuesday.
   Herbert Walker, 45, of Cincinnati, president of the Post Office
Mail Handlers Union, pleaded innocent Tuesday in U.S. District
Court to a 50-count indictment before federal Judge Joseph
Kinneary, said a spokeswoman for Kinneary's office.
   Walker was charged June 16 with embezzling more than $99,000
while head of union Local 304, which represents 3,200 workers in
Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. He was elected to the national post in
December after eight years as the local's president.
   Three labor organizations represent postal workers.
   The indictment alleges that Walker deposited checks payable to
the local in his own account and wrote checks to himself from union
accounts. He also allegedly altered records to make it appear
checks to himself were for union expenses.
   U.S. Attorney D. Michael Crites said a union audit revealed
funds were missing.
   No specific August date was set for Walker's trial.

<TEXT>
   The death of a Nicaraguan defector who
publicly accused the Sandinista government of murder and drug
trafficking was the result of natural causes, police said today,
dismissing suggestions the man may have been murdered.
   An autopsy on Jose Alvaro Baldizon, 29, concluded he was killed
by a burst artery in the brain, said Sgt. William Talbott,
detective bureau supervisor in Bell, the suburb where Baldizon
lived.
   A State Department official in Washington had suggested
Baldizon, who told Congress in 1986 that the leftist Sandinistas
trafficked in drugs and murdered 2,000 political opponents, might
have been poisoned while dining at a Nicaraguan restaurant June 18.
   He died in his sleep June 18 or early June 19, Talbott said. The
detective said many hours passed between Baldizon's meal at the
restaurant in Huntington Beach and his death, and that he ate
dinner with his family the evening of June 18.
   State Department officials in Washington, who spoke on condition
they not be named, had said Baldizon became ill after eating at a
Nicaraguan restaurant he frequented, and said his death had the
``appearances of poisoning.'' The death appeared to have occurred
under ``mysterious circumstances,'' the officials said.
   Nicaragua's government press reported Baldizon's death and
blamed the CIA, State Department officials said.
   But the Los Angeles County coroner found the cause of death was
congenital cerebral aneurysm, Talbott said.
   ``With everything that he's been involved in, people were
looking at it kind of funny,'' Talbott said of the death. ``(But)
as far as the criminal end of it's concerned there's nothing going
on.''
   Baldizon's sister, Rosanna, declined Monday to speculate
publicly on the cause.
   ``All we know is that he died during the night. I cannot comment
on the cause of his death,'' Miss Baldizon said. ``We have no proof
of anything.''
   In 1986, Baldizon testified before Congress in an attempt to
convince lawmakers that additional funding was needed for the
Contras fighting the Nicaraguan government.
   He claimed among other things that the Sandinistas murdered
2,000 political opponents through a systematic policy of ``special
measures,'' or assassinations ordered, by Interior Minister Tomas
Borge or his chief deputy.
   Baldizon crossed the border from Nicaragua to Honduras in July
1985 and began making allegations of Sandinista atrocities and drug
trafficking.
   He claimed Sandinista army units dressed like the Contras and
killed Sandinista supporters so that the rebels would be blamed. He
presented no specific evidence as to when or where such actions
occurred.
   Baldizon told Congress that Borge and other Nicaraguan officials
helped to send cocaine to the United States via Miami, and that he
had seen Interior Ministry documents confirming the activity. He
said money from the drug transactions were being used to finance
espionage.
   He testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee Task
Force in March 1986 that Borge had issued in 1982 ``an order that
all cocaine, dollars and gold had to be turned in to his office.
   ``It was obvious that the confiscated narcotics, gold and
dollars were being sent to places not provided for by law and those
involved were being set free,'' he told the task force.
   Baldizon's allegations were disputed by Americas Watch, a U.S.
human rights group that said he had repeatedly changed his stories.
   Baldizon's survivors include his wife, Maria, and son, who
remain in Nicaragua, Miss Baldizon said.

<HEAD>Governors Say Limited Child Care Expansion Would Be Better Than
Nothing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two governors on Tuesday urged Congress to
pass a major child care expansion bill this year, even if a tight
budget means lawmakers cannot fund the entire $2.5 billion plan.
   ``Anything you give, I'll be grateful for,'' Arkanas Gov. Bill
Clinton, a Democrat, said. ``Don't pass nothing just because you
can't get as much money as you want.''
   ``Whatever way you can help us, we need that help,'' added New
Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, a Republican. ``Whatever money you give us
will be put to extraordinarily good use.''
   Clinton and Kean testified before the Senate Labor and Human
Resources subcommittee on children, family, drugs and alcoholism as
the panel considered the $2.5 billion Act for Better Child Care, or
ABC bill. The measure is sponsored by subcommittee chairman
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and supported by women's, labor, medical
and children's groups.
   Three-fourths of the ABC money would help pay day care expenses
for families making less than 115 percent of a state's median
income. The remaining money would be for training and salaries of
child care workers, renovation of facilities and referral programs
for parents.
   Money would only be available to day care homes and centers that
met minimum federal standards developed by an advisory panel.
   Supporters of the bill have been pursuing an all-or-nothing
strategy, saying no child care bill would be better than a weak
one. Dodd has said he would rather hold the bill for the next
administration than pass a plan he considers inadequate.
   However, Dodd on Tuesday referred to ``a national crescendo of
support'' for federal action on child care and indicated
congressional action may be imminent. ``We don't have a lot of time
here,'' Dodd said. ``There's a moment for these kinds of things and
then other things will take over.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a member of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, said lawmakers would not be able to get $2.5 billion for
the child care bill. Clinton said a good framework and a little
money would suffice for this year.
   Clinton and Kean asked Dodd to re-examine a number of
controversial sections of his bill. Echoing criticism by
conservative groups and lawmakers, they said the bill makes
day-care aid available to too many families at the higher end of
the income scale and asked Dodd to reconsider eligibility standards.
   The governors also said the private sector in day care should be
stressed more strongly; that there should be more flexibility in
using the money, possibly through a broad child care block grant;
and asked Dodd to delete the provision imposing national day-care
standards on states.
   ``Congress should resist the temptation to tell the states what
should be done and how they should do it,'' Kean said. ``Uniform
regulations would not account for differing regional needs.''
   But Dodd said the governors would be ``shocked to find the
tremendous disparity in standards'' from state to state and cited a
review by Deborah Phillips, a University of Virginia researcher.
   In her testimony, Phillips said 28 states have no group size
requirements for child care centers, 28 states have no training or
experience requirements for family day care providers, and
staff-to-infant ratios vary from 7-to-1 in Georgia and North
Carolina to 3-to-1 in Kansas, Massachusetts and Maryland.
   ``We would never want you to give us a lot of money to pour it
into dangerous, unhealthy, unsound day care,'' Clinton told Dodd.
He said a compromise might be to require the development of model
child care standards, with state and local officials included in
the process.
   Some 100 child care bills are pending in Congress, ranging from
tax credits to businesses that establish child care centers to tax
credits to all families with preschool children. One bill would
increase the existing social services block grant and another would
limit provider liability through risk pools. Others propose to give
vouchers to poor families and-or money to day care providers for
capital improvements.

quotes.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration announced today it
is recalling the U.S. ambassador to Mexico for consultations in the
wake of Mexico's decision to release a jailed Puerto Rican
nationalist wanted by the United States for terrorist activities.
   The recall of Ambassador Charles J. Pilliod was announced by
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. The State Department had
expressed outrage Monday at news that William Morales, 37, was
released from prison Friday and allowed to flee to Cuba.
   ``The release and deportation to Cuba of Morales even before
completing his sentence for murdering a Mexican police officer is
outrageous,'' Fitzwater said. ``This decision is an inexplicable
affront to otherwise excellent U.S.-Mexican relations and a great
blow to U.S. and Mexican efforts to combat the scourge of
international terrorism.''
   Fitzwater said the State Department had summoned the Mexican
ambassador to the United States, Jorge Espinosa de los Rayes, on
Monday night ``and expressed our anger over the release of this
convicted terrorist.''
   Morales had served five years of an eight-year sentence for the
murder of a Mexican policeman.
   ``Mexico's action is inexplicable,'' said State Department
spokesman Charles Redman. ``Mr. Morales' violent history is well
known. He is an escaped American prioner.
   ``He was convicted in the United States of serious weapons'
possession charges and was implicated in over 50 bombings by a
Puerto Rican separatist group which from 1976 to 1978 resulted in
the death and injury of many individuals.''
   Redman described as outrageous Mexico's decision not to
extradite Morales to the United States because he is a ``political
fighter.'' That action ``undercuts the fight against terrorism by
legal means,'' he said.
   He added that Mexico's decision could only have been made for
political reasons because the Mexican Foreign Ministry had reversed
a finding by a Mexican court that Morales should be extradited.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Ratification of Treaty on Nuclear Accidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Tuesday urged
speedy Senate ratification of two treaties negotiated in the
aftermath of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in
the Soviet Union which spread nuclear contamination across Western
Europe.
   One treaty requires prompt notification of a nuclear disaster
which has the potential of affecting other nations. The second sets
up a system for providing assistance after a nuclear accident.
   Frederick M. Bernthal, assistant secretary of state for
scientific affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the
objective of the pacts is to ``minimize the radiological
consequences of a nuclear accident, should one occur.''
   He said the treaties stem from the international concern over
``the failure of the Soviet Union to notify the rest of the world
in a timely manner'' after the accident at Chernobyl.
   The treaties were drafted in a four-week period in the summer of
1986 by a conference of 62 nations meeting in Vienna.
   The notification treaty covers accidents at nuclear reactors,
nuclear fuel cycle facilities and radioactive waste management
facilities.
   It also covers accidents involving the transport and storage of
nuclear fuels or radioactive waste as well as radioisotopes used to
generate power in space objects of any kind.
   Accidents involving nuclear weapons are not covered by the
treaty, but a provision does encourage nations to volunteer
information on nuclear weapons accidents.
   The United States has pledged to ``voluntarily provide
notification'' on any nuclear accident, including accidents
involving nuclear weapons.
   The second treaty provides guidelines on the provision of
technical assistance to minimize the effects of nuclear accidents.
   While it does not require any country to provide such
assistance, it does require a prompt response to requests for such
help.
   The administration also asked ratification of a third treaty
intended to protect a Western seat on the board of governors of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
   Bernthal said the change became necessary when the Peoples
Republic of China became a member of the International Atomic
Energy Agency and claimed a seat on the board of directors.
   Bernthal said China's inclusion on the board of governors could
have put a Western seat at risk.
   ``It is important to U.S. national security not to dilute
Western influence on the IAEA board,'' Bernthal said.
   The treaty would expand the number of seats on the board by one
and would ``put all countries back in their starting position,''
Bernthal said. ``In short, ratification of this amendment will
protect a Western seat.''

of Illinois office in Washington and a former executive assistant
to Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., Before coming to Washington, he was
an assistant to Gov. Richard Ogilvie of Illinois.
   Reagan said Oglesby ``was a member of our first term team and
brings a wealth of experience which will be valuable to the
vigorous pursuit of our agenda for the next six months.''
   The White House also announced that John C. Tuck, who has been
deputy assistant to the president and executive assistant to the
chief of staff, is being promoted to assistant to the president and
director of the office of the chief of staff.

   Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick,
picked Tuesday as a featured speaker for the Republican National
Convention, praised George Bush although she had campaigned against
him earlier and faulted Democrat Michael Dukakis for lacking
foreign policy experience.
   Dukakis' shortcoming, she suggested, was partly due to the fact
that ``Massachusetts is a lot further from any foreign borders''
than California, where Ronald Reagan was governor before running
for president.
   Kirkpatrick, who endorsed Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole for
president during the primaries, spoke highly of Bush on Tuesday,
especially in comparison with Dukakis.
   ``I believe he understands a very great deal more about foreign
policy than Michael Dukakis does,'' she told reporters in a news
conference at the Republican National Committee. ``I don't know
Michael Dukakis personally, but we all know that he has had no
opportunity in his life to really devote himself to foreign
affairs. He has been concerned above all with local and state
affairs and George Bush has been concerned with the world.''
   Kirpatrick, who was once active in the Democratic Party, gave a
well-received speech at the 1984 Republican Convention.
   RNC chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said there was no link
between the Kirkpatrick announcement and the Democrats' choice on
Monday of Texas Treasurer Ann Richards as their convention keynote
speaker. Fahrenkopf said the GOP keynoter would be announced in the
next few days.
   Kirkpatrick was asked why she thinks Ronald Reagan had more
foreign policy experience when he took office in 1981 _ after two
terms as governor of California _ than Dukakis.
   ``I believe he did ... in several ways,'' she said. ``First of
all, Ronald Regan had a very active interest in foreign policy
through decades of his life. That interest is a matter of record.
It was supplemented by quite a lot of traveling and speaking for
the United States in foreign countries. The first time I ever saw
Ronald Reagan was in Tokyo in the mid-70s. ...
   ``As governor of California, he had developed a very lively
interest in relations with Mexico and Central America. The first
conversations I ever had with Ronald Reagan were about U.S.-Mexican
and -Central American relations.
   Then she went on:
   ``You know, Massachusetts is a lot further from any foreign
borders ... from troublesome foreign borders than California. ... I
don't think Dukakis' background shows the same kind of persistent
concern either with foreign travel or foreign experience ... that
Ronald Reagan did.''
   Kirkpatrick's news conference opened with her being asked about
comments attributed to her in a party press release.
   ``May I just say nobody writes for me. I mean that quite
seriously _ I write my own things,'' she said.
   Then a reporter read aloud the release, which said Dukakis'
statements on foreign policy ``have been irresponsible and naive.''
Asked if those were in line with here own thoughts, she replied:
   ``I'm afraid so. I regret that's what I think. I believe that
Dukakis lacks the experience in foreign affairs and foreign policy
and national security that a president of United States badly needs
at this time.''
   She said Bush's experience ``is great enough to give his vision
of a strong America content. ... He knows what will make us
strong.''

<TEXT>
   Just as farm equipment manufacturers
were beginning to enjoy a rebound from an eight-year slump, the
drought is turning customers cautious and cooling off the recovery.
   Farmers who had been sizing up tractors and harvesting equipment
have put off purchases while they wait to see if their crop will be
saved by rain, said Bill Hassenfritz, an owner of Hassenfritz Inc.,
a farm equipment dealer in the the southeastern Iowa town of
Mediapolis.
   ``The attitude of farmers was really quite high,'' he said. ``I
can't say (the drought) has completely blown that, but it has put
it on hold.''
   So far, Hassenfritz said, no orders have been canceled, although
he's heard that some dealers have lost sales to drought worries.
   Duane Hawbaker, parts manager at R&M Equipment Co. at Indianola,
south of Des Moines, said farmers not only have held off new
investments, but some also are putting off repairs on equipment for
fall harvests.
   ``It's a very critical year to have that uncertainty show up,''
said Doug Patterson, market information manager for Massey Ferguson
Inc., a manufacturer in Des Moines.
   At Deere & Co. in Moline, Ill., spokesman Bob Combs said the
manufacturer is watching the situation closely, but it's premature
to gauge the drought's impact on the industry. ``A little bit of
rain soon could change things,'' Combs said.
   Before the drought, the farm equipment industry was showing
significant gains from a severe slump.
   The farm debt crisis of the early 1980s and the ailing
agricultural economy had dealt a hard blow to manufacturers of farm
equipment, resulting in layoffs, retrenchments and consolidations
throughout the industry.
   But a recovery in farm fortunes in the past two years has
allowed farmers to reduce debts and make long-postponed purchases
of equipment.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported conditions for farm
equipment sales were brightening in the first quarter of 1988,
extending gains made in the second half of 1987.
   There were sharp gains in retail sales of farm equipment and
even indications that tight supplies may have hindered some sales.
   Sales in the first quarter of farm tractors with 40 horsepower
or more jumped more than 60 percent from a year earlier, with sales
more than doubling of four-wheel drive tractors, according to the
report by Chicago Fed economist Peter Heffernan.
   Patterson said that even with the gains, sales of big tractors
still are 75 percent to 80 percent below peak levels.
   Then the drought hit.
   ``In the near term it will mean a significant slide backwards
with respect to farm equipment sales,'' said George Dahlman, an
analyst who follows the farm equipment industry for the Minneapolis
securities firm of Piper Jaffrey & Hopwood Inc.
   ``Farmers remembered they are only two years into the recovery
and not over liquid,'' he said. ``Those expenditures that don't
have to be made won't be made.''
   Dahlman said he expects the cautious attitude to remain for
another six to eight months. But while the drought comes at a bad
time for the industry, he said he does not believe it will push
manufacturers into bankruptcy.
   ``Farmers are keeping a stiff upper lip and we are too,'' said
Rick James, a spokesman for manufacturer J I Case Co. at Racine,
Wis. ``Some dealers say customers have delayed delivery on units
they have purchased. But this is spotty, we're not seeing it
everywhere.''
   James said there could be a silver lining for manufacturers.
   He said farmers who remain in good financial condition after the
farm downturn of the 1980s are survivors.
   ``As they look toward next year and look to recoup their losses
from this year, they will put more acres under the plow and that
could potentially create a demand for equipment,'' James said.
   Spokesman Glen Christians at Massey Ferguson said, ``the
manufacturer that reaps the rewards this fall will be the one who
targets those farmers who come out (of the drought) the best.''

   An Egyptian army officer arrested in a

   Redman said the Egyptian government had not responded to the

   The officer, Lt. Col. Mohammed Abdella Mohammed, was assigned to

   President Reagan got another in a series of
updates on the defense procurement investigation today, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, and ``wants the matter cleaned up as rapidly
as possible.''
   Fitzwater said he could not go into detail about the discussion,
but that Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci reviewed several matters
that have been discussed publicly, such as the reassignment of
certain Defense Department employees.
   Carlucci told Reagan he has established a ``joint action group''
to ``review the situation on a continuing basis and to make changes
where necessary'' if problems crop up, the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said Reagan agrees that Carlucci should make any such
corrections ``as soon as possible.''
   The president ``wants the matter cleaned up as rapidly as
possible, both from the standpoint of the investigation of
individuals and the procurement system at the Pentagon,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.

<HEAD>Angolans Reject Talks With Savimbi</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A top official of Angola's Marxist government
on Tuesday ruled out talks with U.S.-backed rebels and said
one-party rule for his homeland is the best assurance for national
development.
   Minister of State Pedro de Castro Van-Dunem told reporters that
multiparty democracy has failed elsewhere in Africa and would not
enable Angola to fulfill the goal of achieving a national identity.
   He said the solution for Angola is for the UNITA rebels, who
have waged war against the country's leftist government for 13
years, to lay down their arms and participate in national
reconstruction.
   Van-Dunem, who was accompanied by two other senior Angolan
officials, met with reporters as UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was on
the second day of a Washington visit aimed at rallying support for
national reconciliation talks between the warring parties. Savimbi
was to meet late Tuesday with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Last week, officials from the United States, Angola, Cuba and
South Africa met for a second time in six weeks to discuss the
possibility of a peaceful settlement in Angola.
   South Africa, along with the United States, supports Savimbi's
movement with military equipment and other items. South Africa sent
several thousand troops to Angola last year. Some have been
withdrawn and an undetermined number remain.
   Van-Dunem said Angolan authorities are willing to talk to South
Africa but not to Savimbi's envoys because ``they are not the
masters of their own interests.''
   Angolan Justice Minister Fernando Franca Van-Dunem said he views
the UNITA insurgents as ``ancilliary forces'' of South Africa. At
another point, he said that from the beginning, Savimbi ``has
always appeared as a man sent by somebody else.''
   The Reagan administration has been supporting Savimbi since
1985, seeing him as an ally in its quest to encourage the removal
of more than 40,000 Cuban troops based in Angola.
   The administration also supports the concept of bringing an end
to the fighting in Angola through national reconciliation talks.
   But the Angolan representatives expressed strong opposition to
achieving a peaceful settlement through an electoral process.
   Van-Dunem, the justice minister, acknowledged that the Angolan
president is not the product of an electoral process but said the
country does elect representatives at the provincial and municipal
levels. Some candidates, he added, are not members of the ruling
MPLA party.
   His colleague, the minister of state, said it is not the policy
of the Angolan government to ``smash UNITA'' once peace is achieved.
   ``We do not identify with the objectives of UNITA, which are to
liquidate the people of Angola,'' he said.

<HEAD>Catholics Pray For Church Unity As Schismatic Consecration Nears</HEAD>

   Swiss Roman Catholics began three days of fasting
and prayer for ``unity of faith'' Tuesday before a scheduled
consecration of rebel bishops that would formalize the first major
split in the church since 1870.
   Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who began campaigning against the
``satanic influence of liberalism'' in the church after the Second
Vatican Council reforms of the 1960s, plans to consecrate the four
bishops Thursday at his seminary in Econe, Switzerland.
   Only the pope can name bishops and the Vatican has told
Lefebvre, 82, that consecrating the traditionalist bishops without
approval will mean automatic excommunication _ ejection from the
church _ for all involved.
   Lefebvre's traditionalist movement argues that canon law allows
disobedience to papal authority in a ``situation of emergency.''
The archbishop himself has dismissed the threat of excommunication
as ``without value.''
   Excommunication would create the first schism in the Roman
Catholic Church since Old Catholics broke with Rome over the
doctrine of papal infallibility proclaimed by the First Vatican
Council in 1870.
   The call to pray for ``unity of faith'' among Catholics was
issued by Bishop Henri Schwery of Sion, president of the Swiss
Conference of Bishops. His diocese includes Lefebvre's first
traditionalist seminary, at Econe, where the consecrations are to
be conducted in a huge tent already erected in front of the
buidling.
   Switzerland's bishops urged prayers for unity ``at this very
difficult moment.'' Hans-Peter Roethlin, spokesman for the bishops'
conference, said special services were being held in nearly all
parts of Switzerland, which counts about 3 milloin Roman Catholics
among its 6.3 million people.
   ``Although we must not give up hope that Lefebvre will abandon
his plans, the prayers are chiefly meant to increase awareness of
the importance of church unity,'' Roethlin said in an interview.
   A West German newspaper quoted a leading member of the
traditionalist movement Tuesday as expressing certainty more talks
will be held with the Vatican after the consecrations.
   ``It is only a matter of time until we sit down together
again,'' the Rev. Franz Schmidberger was quoted as saying in an
interview with the newspaper, Die Welt.
   ``Until then, our position will not change,'' he added, in an
apparent reference to automatic excommunication.
   In the Sion Diocese, the faithful were urged to pray and fast
until noon Thursday, about the time the Econe ceremonies are
expected to end.
   Lefebvre says consecrations are necessary to ensure continuity
of the traditionalist movement after his death. He has said it
would be ``orphaned'' without bishops to ordain traditionalist
priests.
   Assisting him at the ceremony will be an 84-year-old former
Brazilian bishop, Antonio de Castro Mayer of Campos, the only one
of more than 2,000 bishops of the church to lend public support to
Lefebvre's 18-year-old campaign against church reforms.
   Lefebvre says the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, which
met from 1962 to 1965, put the church on a course of
``auto-destruction'' by introducing modern rites in the vernacular
and intruducing other ``modernist'' elements.
   His campaign caused Pope Paul VI to order his suspension from
priestly and episcopal functions in 1976, which barred him from
celebrating Mass or giving the sacraments.
   He ignores the ban as ``illegal,'' continuing to ordain new
priests and open new seminaries and other traditionalist centers
throughout the world. His followers use the Tridentine Mass, a
traditional Latin rite for which permission is required.
   On Wednesday, the day before the consecrations, Lefebvre plans
to ordain 16 new traditionalist priests, bringing the total to more
than 220.
   His movement claims millions of followers, but Vatican spokesman
Joaquin Navarro extimates the number at 60,000-80,000. A petition
circulated two years ago urging the Vatican to lift sanctions
against Lefebvre obtained 135,000 signatures.
   The four bishops to be consecrated are Richard Williamson, 48,
who was born in Britain and heads the traditionalist seminary in
Ridgefield, Conn.; Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, 43, executive
director of Lefebvre's movement; Alfonso de Galarreta, 31,
Spanish-born head of the seminary in Argentina, and Bernard Fellay,
30, a Swiss who is the movement's chief administrator.

   No doubt about it, they just don't get the same
attention that their prime-time counterparts do, but don't try to
tell Phil Donahue, who has an office full of them, that Daytime
Emmys aren't important.
   ``The daytime schedule always been a kind of stepsister to the
prime-time schedule ... but I think that stopped bothering us a
long time ago,'' said Donahue, who noted that doing five shows a
week ``is a very challenging assignment.''
   ``You can't just be good on Tuesday, you have to be good all
through the week,'' said Donahue, who recently celebrated the 20th
anniversary of his talk show.
   Donahue will be host Wednesday for the ``Daytime Emmy Awards
Presentation,'' to be carried live beginning at 3 p.m. EDT on CBS.
   The awards go to top daytime drama, talk show, children's
programming and game show, among other categories. They will be
presented in the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
   CBS' ``Pee-wee's Playhouse,'' the innovative live-action show
starring comedian Paul Reubens as a oversized kid in a tiny suit,
topped the technical awards last year but lost out as best
children's show to PBS' long-running ``Sesame Street.'' Both are
nominated again this year along with public television's ``Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood.''
   ``Pee-wee'' had the most total nominations this year _ 14 _ and
won three technical Emmys that were handed out Sunday.
   Vying for best daytime drama this year are NBC's ``Santa
Barbara'' and ``All My Children,'' ABC's ``General Hospital'' and
CBS' ``The Young and the Restless'' and ``As the World Turns,''
last year's winner.
   Best game or audience-participation show will be chosen from
among CBS' ``The Price Is Right'' and ``The $25,000 Pyramid'' and
NBC's ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Win, Lose or Draw.'' Except for
Pat Sajak of ``Wheel,'' all the game-show hosts were nominated in
their category, plus Alex Trebek for ``Classic Concentration.''
   ``Donahue'' will go up against ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' which
won last year as best talk or information program. Both are
syndicated. Winfrey also won as best host. Also nominated are the
syndicated ``Wil Shriner Show,'' and PBS' ``The Frugal Gourmet''
and ``This Old House.''
   Susan Lucci is nominated as outstanding lead actress in a drama
for the ninth time. She has never won. She plays Erika Kane
Montgomery in ``All My Children.'' Luccia will be up against
Elizabeth Hubbard from ``As the World Turns,'' Erika Slezak of
``One Life to Live,'' Helen Gallagher of ``Ryan's Hope,'' and Marcy
Walker of ``Santa Barbara.''
   Larry Bryggman, who won last year's lead actor award for his
role as Dr. John Dixon in ``As the World Turns'' is nominated again
along with Robert Gentry and David Canary, both of ``All My
Children,'' Stephen Nichols of NBC's ``Days of Our Lives'' and A.
Martinez of ``Santa Barbara.''
   Last year's winner for best animated program, ``Jim Henson's
Muppet Babies'' on CBS, was nominated again this year along with
NBC's ``Smurfs'' and ``Alvin and the Chipmunks,'' CBS'
``Storybreak'' and the syndicated ``Disney's Duck Tales.''
   ABC received two nominations for outstanding children's special
for ``Just a Regular Kid: An AIDS Story'' and ``The Kid Who
Wouldn't Quit: The Brad Silverman Story.'' CBS received two
nominations for ``Never Say Goodbye'' and ``What If I'm Gay?''

<TEXT>
   An express passenger train
today slammed into a derailed freight train in southern West
Germany, and officials said one person was killed and at least
eight seriously injured.
   Egon Thewes, a spokesman for the federal railway office in
Saarbruecken said the passenger train hit the cars of a freight
train that derailed after heavy rains washed debris and mud on
railroad tracks east of Kaiserslautern.
   Kaiserslautern is located about 90 miles southwest of Frankfurt.
   Rescue workers found one person killed in the accident and at
least eight seriously injured, officials said. The injured were
taken to hospitals in the area, Thewes said.
   More than 100 people were on the passenger train when the
accident occurred, officials said.
   Thewes said the accident occurred on just east of Kaiserslautern
when the freight train plowed into a mudslide caused by heavy
showers in the area.
   The freight train derailed after crashing into the debris from
the mudslide, with some cars blocking parallel tracks, officials
said.
   ``The express train plowed into this mass of derailed cars and
mud and all of its cars left the track,'' said Thewes.
   He said the freight train was headed for Mannheim with a load of
coal. The passenger train was going from Heidelberg to
Saarbruecken, Thewes said.
   Thewes said heavy cranes were being used to clear the tracks of
damaged railroad cars.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush today
endorsed the recommendation of a federal advisory commission on
AIDS for a law barring discrimination against people suffering from
the deadly virus.
   ``I think it is needed,'' Bush said, less than 24 hours after
the advisory panel presented its report to President Reagan.
   ``I think it is important to do a lot to lay to rest some of the
fears. There is a lot of misunderstanding,'' Bush said.
   Announcing his position, Bush acknowledged that he was getting
out ahead of Reagan, who did not comment on the recommendations.
Instead, Reagan directed his drug policy adviser, Dr. Ian
MacDonald, to come up within 30 days with `a course of action that
takes us forward.''
   Bush said Reagan ``did the right thing. ... How can the White
House be asked to take an instant position?''
   When it was pointed out that Bush was doing just that, the vice
president said Reagan ``just saw this thing yesterday. He's not
running for president. Maybe he wasn't asked the question, either.''
   Bush, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, said
``I've got a different role here. I want to say what I think.''
   He spoke with reporters on Air Force II on a flight to northern
California.
   He planned to tour NASA's AMES Research Center at Mountain View
and then travel to San Franciso, a city whose homosexual population
has been devastated by AIDS.
   Bush, asked if the government should spend more on AIDS
research, said, ``No.'' He said he based his feeling on the advice
of experts at the National Institutes of Health.
   ``We have the proper level of funding. It's close to $1
billion,'' Bush said.

   Two Omaha Indians, their eyes filled
with tears, became the first members of their tribe in 100 years to
touch the Sacred Pole of the Omaha Tribe.
   ``This occasion is very significant to me because my
great-great-grandfather, Yellow Smoke, was the keeper of the sacred
pole,'' Doran Morris, chairman of the Omaha Tribal Council, said at
the ceremony at Harvard University.
   He and Edward Cline, tribal planner for the Omahas, came from
Nebraska to Harvard's Peabody Museum to touch the pole Monday and
negotiate for its return.
   Morris said the pole is about 200 years old and was entrusted to
the Peabody by Yellow Smoke because he did not believe the younger
generation of Omahas would cherish it.
   The pole, more than five feet long, is made of cottonwood and
ash. A human scalp is at one end.
   ``I have been talking to my people, and they feel we need to
bring the Sacred Pole home to unite us as a tribe,'' Morris said.
``It is the consensus of our people, both the young and the old.''
   He said there are about 5,000 people in the tribe, 2,400 of them
on the reservation.
   ``This pole is a living tree, a living person, as far as we are
concerned,'' Cline said. ``It was there for the people to see, to
be part of, to touch and to keep the tribe together.''
   ``The object embodies so much of the soul of the Omaha,'' said
Ian W. Brown, the Peabody's associate curator of North American
Collections. ``It represents the authority of their leaders, the
unity between man and woman, and the binding element that has held
the Omaha people together for centuries.''

<HEAD>Rolls-Royce Takes on Pet Casket Business</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Fixes style to Rolls-Royce, with hyphen, throughout.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luxury automaker Rolls-Royce may like to carry
its passengers in style over the highways of life, but it doesn't
want people to mistakenly think it takes family pets into the
hereafter.
   The British company is challenging a logo used by a company that
makes caskets and burial kits for pets.
   Rolls-Royce has filed documents with the U.S. Patent Office in
Washington, alleging that Pet Rest Inc., owned by Mike and Sandy
McCormack, has adopted a logo confusingly close to its own.
   Pet Rest's logo includes a capital P and an interlocking capital
R. Rolls-Royce said it has used two interlocking capital Rs to
identify its company since 1925.
   ``Literally, I sat down with a tablet and drew variations of the
letters P and R, side-by-side, up and down and interlocking,''
McCormack said. ``We tried to find any way that the letters could
work well together in a logo. It was by chance that we selected the
one we use today.''
   The McCormacks founded their business three years ago in Lima,
about 75 south of Toledo. Mrs. McCormack said the burial kits
include satin-lined burial capsules, suggestions for a memorial
service and even grief counseling. Prices range from $80 to $1,499
and kits can accommodate pets as large as a Doberman pinscher.
   The company could gross up to $1 million this year, the
McCormacks said.
   Mrs. McCormack learned of the challenge from Rolls-Royce this
month by registered letter.
   ``It was very surprising,'' she said. ``We were just astounded
that anyone could confuse a Rolls-Royce product with a Pet Rest
product.''
   She said the PR logo is not stamped on the burial kits, but is
used on boxes and in advertising.
   Attorneys for Rolls-Royce declined to comment. But in documents
filed with the appeals board, the attorneys argue that the
similarity of the trademarks might give rise to a mistaken belief
that Pet Rest's products originate from or are sponsored by
Rolls-Royce.
   The McCormacks plan to fight _ at least for now.
   ``Rather than come on with a lawsuit against a small company
like ours, they'll just fight the trademark year after year with
the hope that after five years and perhaps $25,000, if we can even
afford to drag it on that long, we will give up,'' Mrs. McCormack
said.

   Secretary of State George Shultz's trip to
Central America this week will have the primary purpose of
``shoring up'' the four democracies in the region by demonstrating
long-term U.S. support, according to congressional leaders who met
with Shultz on Tuesday.
   During a 1{-hour breakfast with House Speaker Jim Wright, House
Minority Leader Robert Michel and other leaders, Shultz made no
mention of renewing military aid to the Contra rebels fighting
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, participants said.
   ``He says what he really wants to do is to shore up and
reinforce our commitment to the success of the four democratic
countries in the region,'' said Wright, D-Texas. The speaker called
the discussion a sign of a ``shift in emphasis'' by the
administration.
   ``There's a presumption that he wouldn't be doing this unless
there were a reason, some change in policy, some thought as to
where they're going,'' said one Democratic leadership aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shultz leaves Wednesday for a three-day trip to Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. He does not plan to visit
Nicaragua, where talks between the Sandinista government and the
U.S.-backed rebels remain stalled.
   One participant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Shultz
told the leaders: ``This is not a Contra aid trip. This is a peace
and democracy trip.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater conceded that the
U.S. push to democratize Nicaragua has stalled and said further
decisions on strategy must await completion of Shultz's trip to
Central America.
   Amid increasing reports that Contra troops are returning to
their base camps inside Nicaragua, and with no new peace talks
scheduled, Fitzwater was asked whether Reagan had decided to submit
a new aid package to Congress.
   ``We will not have any judgment on the package until sometime
after'' Shultz returns from the region on Friday, he replied, ``and
we don't have a specific schedule, even on that.''
   Wright, who has been the chief opponent of administration
efforts to send weapons to the anti-Sandinista rebels, said Shultz
appeared to recognize that Congress is in no mood to vote further
military aid.
   ``Maybe rather than trying to send more weapons ... it might be
mroe useful to make a convincing demonstration of our long-term
support of democracy in those countries that practice it,'' Wright
said.
   Michel, R-Ill., acknowledged there was no current sentiment in
Congress for a renewal of military aid, but he said there was a
need to do something ``to put (the talks) back on track and to put
the Contras in a better position. That's a congressional
responsibility.''
   He said during the meeting, Shultz showed an interest in
multilateral talks that would include all Central American
countries, including Nicaragua, and could lead to regional
non-aggression treaties and the expulsion of foreign military
advisers from Nicaragua.
   There was also some discussion about the possibility of a
regional economc aid package that could serve as an added
enticement for the Sandinistas to conclude a peace accord and make
democratic reforms, participants said.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said Shultz told the bipartisan
leadership group that the rebels are interested in resuming the
peace talks that broke off earlier this month, but do not want to
hold the talks in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.

   Recording star Stevie Wonder said Tuesday that he
is thinking about running for mayor.
   ``I hope someday, and this is really going to shock you, ...
someday I probably will think about running for mayor of this city,
straight out,'' Wonder said during a show on radio station WJLB-FM.
   Wonder said he is ``very serious,'' but has no immediate plans
to challenge Mayor Coleman Young, whose term expires in 1989.
   ``Coleman, don't worry,'' Wonder said. ``Not yet.''
   Young was out of town and unavailable for comment, his
spokesman, Bob Berg, said, but he added that the mayor ``is a big
fan of his music.''
   Wonder said he believes solutions exist to drug abuse, teen-age
gangs and the breakdown of the family, but ``people really have not
attacked those problems.''
   Wonder, who was born in Saginaw and raised in Detroit, achieved
his first music success in Detroit and records for the Motown label.

   Here are excerpts from Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's address Tuesday to the Communist Party Conference, as
translated by the Soviet government:
   _On farming:
   ``Some advances are on hand. But they cannot satisfy us. In
substance, the increase we have achieved in food output has largely
been used to cover the demand connected with the growth of the
population. And that, comrades, means that we need other, still
higher rates of building up food resources. We have neither the
moral nor the political right to tolerate the delay in resolving
the food problem. ...
   We must restore the economic balance between town and
countryside, and release to the utmost the potential of collective
and state farms by promoting diverse contractual and lease
arrangements. We must overcome the estrangement between farmer and
soil. We must make the farmer sovereign master, protect him against
command methods and cardinally change the conditions of life in
villages. That is the only way to rapidly heighten the efficiency
of the agro-industrial sector and to secure a radical improvement
in food supplies across the country.''
   _On price increases:
   ``The pricing reform cannot fail to affect retail prices as
well, because they are closely connected with the system of prices
as a whole. Today, the retail price of many food products, notably
that of meat and milk, is considerably lower than the actual cost
of producing them, lower than the state's procurement price.
   The state is compelled to cover this difference in the form of a
subsidy to the consumer. That is not a normal situation. It
undermines the incentives for producing these products and gives
rise to a wasteful attitude, especially towards bread.''
   _ On human rights:
   ``I would like to dwell particularly on the political freedoms
that enable a person to express his opinion on any matter. The
implementation of these freedoms is a real guarantee that any
problem of public interest will be discussed from every angle, and
all the pros and cons will be weighed, and that this will help to
find optimal solutions with due consideration for all the diverse
opinions and actually possibilities.
   In short, comrades, what we are talking about is a new role of
public opinion in the country. And there is no need to fear the
novel, unconventional character of some opinions, there is no need
to overreact and lapse into extremes at every turn of the debates.
   I also want to touch upon such a fundamental matter as freedom
of conscience, which is very much in the public eye just now in
connection with the millennium of the introduction of Christianity
in Russia. We do not conceal our attitude to the religious outlook
as being non-materialistic and unscientific. But this is no reason
for a disrespectful attitude to the spiritual-mindedness of the
believer, still less for applying any administrative pressure to
assert materialistic views.
   Lenin's decree on the separation of the church from the state
and schools from the church, adopted 70 years ago, provided a new
basis for the relations between them. It is known that these
relations have not always developed normally. ...
   All believers, irrespective of the religion they profess, are
full-fledged citizens of the U.S.S.R. ...
   Our entire legal system is designed to guarantee strict
observance of the rights of citizens to the inviolability of their
private life, home, the secrecy of telephone communication, postal
and telegraph correspondence. The law must reliably protect a
person's dignity. ...
   As you know, we have lately more than once encountered attempts
to use democratic rights for undemocratic purposes. There are some
who think that in this way any problems can be solved _ from
redrawing boundaries to setting up opposition parties. The CPSU
Central Committee considers that such absues of democratization are
fundamentally at variance with the aims of perestroika and run
counter to the people's interests.''
   _ On government organization:
   ``We should organize state power and government so that the
people would always have the final say and the processes of
self-regulation and self-government would be given the widest
possible scope. Of fundamental importance here is the proper
distribution of authority, of powers between the principal elements
of our political system, first and foremost between the party and
the state. ...
   It is also time we introduced a number of democratic
restrictions on the duration of service in elective offices. Our
past record shows that the absence of these restrictions was a
prime cause of abuses of power both centrally and locally.

   A Teamster organizer accused of accepting a
bribe from an FBI agent posing as a Hollywood producer who wanted
to make a non-union movie has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
conspiracy.
   Russell J. Masetta of Teamsters Local 848 in El Monte, who was
originally indicted on a felony charge, entered his plea Monday.
   The government said it would recommend a maximum six-month
sentence, but U.S. District Judge William D. Keller said Masetta
can withdraw the plea if he is sentenced to serve any time in jail
in addition to a period of probation.
   Masetta's attorney, Richard Beck, said he expects Keller to look
at his client as ``a family man'' with no prior convictions.
   Masetta admitted he conspired with a reputed Mafia captain to
accept about $1,000 from the undercover FBI agent he believed to be
a film producer.
   In exchange for the money, Masetta allegedly promised the
producer initially that the union would not try to organize workers
on the production, said Richard A. Stavin, a special attorney for
the Justice Department's organized crime strike force in Los
Angeles.
   Masetta accepted about $200 before backing out of the deal,
Stavin said.
   He was charged in the conspiracy case with Luigi Gelfuso Jr.,
who has been described by prosecutors as a reputed Mafia captain.
   Gelfuso has denied any connection with organized crime, as has
Masetta.
   Masetta was originally indicted on a felony extortion conspiracy
charge alleging that he and Gelfuso planned to take $25,000 from
the film producer.
   The government's key witness died of cancer, though, and the
charge was reduced to a misdemeanor through a plea bargain.
   Masetta's plea was entered one day before the federal government
charged that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters is
dominated by organized crime and filed a civil suit in New York to
force free elections and other reforms in the nation's largest
union.

   The Michigan House Elections Committee
voted unanimously Tuesday in favor of reinstating a presidential
primary election in 1992.
   Under the Senate-passed bill, which now goes to the full House,
voters would have to declare in advance whether they wanted to vote
on the Republican or Democratic side.
   The provision was added by lawmakers to meet the Democratic
National Committee rules which don't recognize results of ``open
primaries'' allowing members of each party to cross over and vote
for another party's candidate.
   In Michigan, the 1976 primary marked the last time that both
major parties participated in the open primary. The Republicans had
a primary in 1980 but opted for a multi-tiered convention system in
the past two elections.
   Since 1980, the Democrats have held caucuses every four years.
   Leaders of both parties have supported the return to a primary.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. military attache in Greece was
killed today on the street where he lived by a bomb in a parked car
that blew his armor-plated car off the road as he drove to work.
   The Pentagon confirmed the attack and identified him as Navy
Capt. William E. Nordeen.
   The officer was 100 yards from his home when the blast hurled
his car across the small tree-lined street and lodged it in a steel
fence, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The victim's decapitated body was found a few yards away in the
front yard of an abandoned house.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast,
but senior police officials said they believed it to be the work of
November 17, a left-wing urban terrorist group.
   In Washington, chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard confirmed
Nordeen's identity and condemned his murder as a ``cowardly act.''
   ``The United States condemns this terrorist outrage in the
strongest possible terms,'' Howard said. ``It was a senseless and
cowardly murder of a highly regarded U.S. military officer.''
   The spokesman said the U.S. government had received no claims of
responsibility for the assassination ``and at this point we don't
know who is responsible.''
   Howard said Nordeen was serving as the U.S. defense attache as
well as the naval attache to Greece. The 51-year-old officer was
born in Amery, Wis., but listed his U.S. home in Centuria, Wis, the
U.S. Navy said. He is survived by a wife and daughter, Howard said.
   According to a service biography released by Howard, Nordeen
moved to Athens for the job in August 1985. Trained originally as a
Navy helicopter pilot, Nordeen most recently worked on the staff of
the Naval inspector general from June 1983 to April 1984, then
transferred as a student to the Defense Intelligence Agency for
training to become an attache.
   The explosion occurred at 8:06 a.m. (1:06 a.m. EDT) in the
northern Athens suburb of Kifissia, where many American and foreign
diplomats live.
   Trees, fences, gates and walls in the area around the explosion
were blackened by smoke after fire engulfed both cars.
   ``We heard a tremendous bang, and my house rocked back and
forth. I have never seen such destruction in my life,'' Panorghia
Kapodistria told The Associated Press.
   ``The windows exploded inward and even pieces of the car were
thrown into my house. My husband was hit in the face by the
glass,'' she said, standing in her front yard with the
booby-trapped car's mangled rear axle.
   Her husband, Yiannis Kapodistria, 84, was taken to a nearby
hospital and treated for facial cuts. The booby-trapped car, which
exploded in front their home, was destroyed in the blast.
   Large body panels from both automobiles were strewn in a 50-yard
radius.
   Police bomb experts said the device was detonated by ``some kind
of remote-control radio device.'' They said the bomb was apparently
planted in the trunk of a Japanese sub-compact.
   An witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told police he
saw two men on a motorcycle drive away shortly after the explosion.
   The November 17 terrorist group carried out a similar attack
against the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's local chief in January,
but George Carros survived after the radio-controlled bomb n a
trash can outside his home failed to go off.
   Although November 17 has used a .45-caliber pistol in most of
its slayings, it said at the time that it had planted the bomb
outside Carros' home because his car was armor-plated and difficult
to attack with a pistol.
   The group has claimed responsibility for 11 assassinations since
1975, including the 1983 shooting of U.S. Navy Capt. George Tsantes
and the 1975 assassination of Richard Welch, CIA station chief in
Athens.
   November 17 is named for the day in 1973 when troops crushed a
student uprising against the 1967-74 Greek military dictatorship.
   Nordeen's killing came four days after Greek and American
negotiators ended a seventh round of talks on a new U.S. bases
agreement to replace an accord that expires Dec. 31, 1988.
   The talks ended without reports of significant progress.
   Greek government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos condemned the
killing, saying that ``the government expresses its disgust for the
murder here of the American military and naval attache William
Nordeen.''
   ``All Greeks, irrespective of their political leanings,
unreservedly condemn the would-be underminers of the country's
institutions and democratic normality,'' Kostopoulos told reporters
at a news briefing.

<TEXT>
   The most important step the Navy can take to
reduce plastic pollution of the ocean is to reduce the amount of
plastic going aboard its ships in food and other packaging, a panel
of Navy, environmentalist and animal welfare representatives said
Tuesday.
   The Navy already has begun to carry out some recommendations and
has canceled orders for 11 million small plastic bags for use in
carrying purchases away from ships' stores, the committee said.
   The committee was organized last year by the Keystone Center, a
group of environmental mediators based in Keystone, Colo., in
anticipation of legisation passed later to implement an
international agreement to end disposal of plastic trash at sea.
   Environmentalists increasingly are concerned over the killing of
birds, fish and marine mammals by long-lasting plastics such as
six-pack rings that are eaten by or entangle sea creatures.
   ``We are trying to reverse a tradition of millennia'' of trash
disposal at sea, said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., at the news
conference where the recommendations were presented.
   `The Navy's initial position was that it couldn't possibly
comply; that it would take at least 20 years,'' said Studds, who is
chairman of the fisheries, wildlife conservation and environment
subcommittee of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.
   The Keystone committee said such skepticism was quickly turned
into enthusiastic cooperation, largely as a result of the work of
Nancy Stehle, deputy director for the environment in the office of
the assistant secretary of the Navy for shipbuilding and logistics.
   She ``set the example and established the tone we all needed for
frankness and openness. She focused our attention on helping the
Navy solve the problem,'' the committee said.
   Warships pose a particular problem because space aboard them is
very limited.
   The recommendations call for reducing the plastics carried
because that would ``greatly reduce the need for expensive
technologies intended to facilitate storage and disposal.''
   The committee said the Navy should review specifications for
food and other items to buy them in degradable, non-plastic
packaging whereever possible, support development of compactors and
degradable plastics, unload unnecessary plastics before leaving
port and separate plastics for carriage home before disposing of
other trash at sea.
   In addition to representatives of the Navy, congressional staffs
and the Keystone Center, the committee had members from the
American Cetacean Society, the Animal Protection Institute of
America, the Oceanic Society, Defenders of Wildlife, the Center for
Environmental Education, the Texas Environmental Coalition, the
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Monitor Consoritum and
Greenpeace.
   The Navy must report to Congress in three years on its progress
in complying with the international agreement on plastic disposal
after five years.

   Pope John Paul II installed 24 cardinals
Tuesday, offered them as symbols of church unity and urged
followers of rebel French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre not to break
with the papacy.
   Lefebvre plans to consecrate four traditionalist bishops
Thursday without papal permission, which the Vatican has said will
result in automatic excommunication of those involved. John Paul
says a schism in the Roman Catholic church, the first since 1870,
appears inevitable.
   The church crisis cast a shadow over the otherwise joyous
ceremony of conferring red hats on the new ``princes of the
church,'' who include two U.S. archbishops, James Hickey of
Washington, D.C., and Edmund Szoka of Detroit.
   Prelates from Lithuania and Hong Kong also were in the group,
indicating the pontiff's desire to expand church influence in the
Soviet Union and China.
   Without mentioning Lefebvre by name, John Paul said: ``We are
very saddened by the news ... that one of our brothers in the
episcopate, who for several years has withheld the required
obedience to the Holy See ... will soon proceed with the ordination
of bishops without the apostolic mandate, and will thus break the
unity of the church, drawing with him large numbers of his
followers into a dangerous situation of schism.''
   He said Lefebvre, who plans to consecrate the biships at his
seminary in Econe, Switzerland, had appeared ready for a
settlement, ``but now it seems that the decision of our brother can
no longer be reversed.''
   Referring to followers of the 82-year-old traditionalist, John
Paul said: ``We pray and exhort them with all our heart to remain
in the house of the Father and to understand that every truth of
faith and every correct way of living finds its place in the
church.''
   Lefebvre, who rejects many reforms of the 1962-65 Second Vatican
Council, was suspended from priestly duties in 1976 by Pope Paul VI
but has ordained more than 200 priests since then in defiance of
the Vatican.
   A compromise reached by the two sides last month fell through
and Lefebvre said he would go ahead with the consecration. He says
traditionalist bishops are necessary to ensure the continuity of
his movement after he dies.
   The last schism in the church occurred in 1870, when the Old
Catholics broke with Rome after the First Vatican Council
proclaimed papal infallibility.
   John Paul made his comments Tuesday to 58 cardinals, who held a
closed meeting in the frescoed Consistory Hall of the Apostolic
Palace to give formal approval to the new cardinals. The remarks,
in Latin, were released by the Vatican.
   After the private ceremony, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the
Vatican secretary of state, read the 24 names to an audience of
about 10,000 in the Paul VI auditorium. Each new cardinal wore a
crimson cassock and gold cross.
   The pope, wearing a gold-embroidered red cape over white robes,
entered and sat in a high-backed beige chair at the center of the
stage. One by one, the new cardinals climbed the steps and knelt
before John Paul, who placed on their heads the three-cornered hat
known as a biretta.
   Speaking in Italian, the pontiff said the hat ``signifies that
you should be ready to comport yourselves with strength, up to the
point of spilling blood, for the growth of the Christian faith, for
peace and tranquility of the people of God and for the freedom and
the spread of the Holy Roman Church.''
   He frequently stressed Christian unity both in the remarks to
the meeting of cardinals and his public address at the elevation.
   Noting the diversity of the 24 prelates, who represent 17
countries and five continents, he stressed the ``common roots of
the College of Cardinals, constituted by the unity of the seat of
the Roman church.''
   John Paul also announced long-awaited reforms in the Curia, the
Vatican administration. Changes include a special oversight panel
for the Vatican Bank, which was linked to Italy's worst postwar
banking scandal.
   Four new cardinals are from Italy and two each from the United
States, Brazil, Spain and India. The others are from Canada,
Mozambique, Colombia, Australia, Hungary, Cameroon, Austria,
France, West Germany, Mauritius, Hong Kong and Lithuania.
   The College of Cardinals, the most important governing body of
the church, now has 160 members, 121 of whom under age 80 and thus
eligible to elect a pope. John Paul had named 25 new cardinals, but
Hans Urs von Balthasar of Switzerland died Sunday at age 82.

   Two Harvard professors, Richard E.
Neustadt and Ernest R. May, were named Tuesday as the first
recipients of a $150,000 award for ideas that foster world order.
   Neustadt and May won the 1988 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas
Improving World Order for their proposal of how contemporary
political leaders should draw on past experience in tackling the
world's problems.
   The two said they would use the prize to follow up on their
winning entry.
   Neustadt said the award should bring attention to their winning
idea, which is set forth in ``Thinking in Time: The Uses of History
for Decision-Makers,'' a 329-page book published by The Free Press
in 1986.
   Neustadt, 69, is a professor of government; May, 59, is a
history professor.
   In the book, the two proposed that lessons from the past can be
useful in shaping modern public policy if they are used carefully
and early enough.
   They explain, for example, how the Kennedy administration's
analysis of Soviet history and Nikita Khrushchev's personal
background helped resolve the Cuban missile crisis in the early
1960s.
   May said their follow-up work will involve developing a more
efficient means of communication in times of crises between a
decision-maker such as the president and experts.
   ``When the president has to make a decision on a foreign
government ... he needs to communicate with an expert on that
country,'' May said in a telephone interview from Sunriver, Ore.
   Jurors chosen by the University of Louisville reviewed 60
nominations before deciding on Neustadt and May's entry.
   ``When policies fail because of mistaken decisions in major
issues affecting international relations, progress toward world
order is set back and confident expectations turn sour,'' the
jurors said.
   ``The authors show plainly when, where, how and why this happens
and develop prescriptions for avoiding it,'' they said.
   The jurors said statesmen, legislators, scholars and the public
could find useful lessons for the future in the work.
   The international relations prize is one of four $150,000 awards
established by Charles Grawemeyer, a 1934 graduate of the
University of Louisville, to stimulate the worldwide development of
new ideas.
   A Grawemeyer award in the field of music composition has been
awarded in three prior years. An award in education is supposed to
be made this year; an award in religion is supposed to be made next
spring.
   Grawemeyer, 74, operated a local plastics business, then retired
and became an investor.

   L. Stanley Chauvin Jr., preparing to
become president-elect of the American Bar Association, doesn't
forget the worn, country paths that led him to the job.
   A new computer terminal sits in one corner of Chauvin's
Louisville office, electronically linking bar associations, lawyers
and others in the profession.
   If the fixture can be considered a symbol of the new issues
facing lawyers as Chauvin takes office, the picture above it of the
Class of '53 at Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tenn.,
could represent the past Chauvin cherishes.
   When Chauvin, 53, assumes his elected office at the ABA's House
of Delegates meeting Aug. 10 in Toronto, he will bring to it the
experience of a lawyer who learned the ropes by watching his peers.
   ``When I came to the bar, if you heard someone was going to try
a case on a unique question of law, ... it was not unusual to go
over, sit down, listen to part of their case, look at the
instructions, talk to the lawyers about it. Lawyers are willing to
do it now, but it's a matter of time,'' he said in an interview
Monday.
   Nostalgic as Chauvin may be about days when time wasn't such a
luxury, he is eager to begin a more hectic pace, traveling and
speaking on behalf of the 350,000-member association in addition to
his practice with the firm of Barnett & Alagia, where he handles
both corporate and civil cases.
   He has been pursuing the ABA presidency for seven or eight
years. ``I pretty much decided (then) that it was a possibility or
something that if it were possible, I would like to do it.''
   Chauvin succeeds Robert D. Raven of San Francisco as
president-elect and Raven moves up to the post of president.
Chauvin will become president a year from now.
   Chauvin was chairman of the House of Delegates from 1982 to
1984, a post he believes prepared him for the chief job.
   ``You know, that's not one of your easier jobs, being locked in
a room with 400 lawyers. I thought, `Well, if I can handle this
job, then it might become a reality.''' The delegates decide policy
stands for the ABA.
   With Chauvin as chairman, the delegates took up such issues as
the code of professional conduct, gay rights, the insanity defense
and malpractice insurance, topics that allowed him to use his
folksy style to defuse controversy.
   The president of the ABA concerns himself primarily with current
matters, while the president-elect plans for the coming year,
Chauvin said.
   His agenda covers everything from lawyer advertising to
children's rights to toxic waste to alternative ways of resolving
disputes, but they all fall under the two obligations Chauvin
believes lawyers have: to protect citizens' rights and to make
society better.
   Chauvin is delighted with his upcoming position.
   ``I would not be any happier doing anything else that I know
of.''

   Edmund Szoka whispered his thanks to the

the archbishops of Detroit and Washington, D.C., became cardinals
on Tuesday.
   More than 500 Americans were among about 10,000 people who

   Cardinals, who elect the pope, make up the highest governing

   ``It was a very emotional experience,'' Szoka said after the
ceremony. ``I was much more moved than I expected.'' His parents
were born in Poland, John Paul's native land.
   The cardinals first received certificates of their new office
from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli.
   As the tall, ruddy-faced Hickey mounted the platform in the Paul
VI auditorium, friends and relatives jumped up and cheered.
Applause filled the hall when Szoka, a slight man with glasses,
received his certificate.
   In a later part of the ceremony, John Paul gave the churchmen
their red hats, called birettas, and made them titular heads of
different churches in Rome. Each wore a red cassock and gold cross.
   Hickey, 67, walked briskly up the 10 steps and knelt solemnly
before the pope.
   John Paul placed the biretta gently on his head, blessed him and
made him titular head of the Church of St. Maria Mother of the
Redemptor. Cardinals are appointed heads of Rome churches because
of a church tradition that only pastors of Rome can elect the pope.
   Hickey kissed the pope on both cheeks and walked over to embrace
other cardinals.
   ``It was an awesome moment,'' he said at a reception in the
Pontifical North American College, where he was rector in 1969-74.
``I felt very much filled with grace.''
   Szoka, 60, listened attentively as John Paul blessed him and
made him titular head of the Church of Saints Andrea and Gregorio.
   As he rose, Szoka whispered, ``I thank you most sincerely for
everything'' in Polish, and the pontiff smiled.
   ``He said something'' in response, Szoka told reporters later,
but ``I can't remember now what he said.''
   Both new American cardinals are considered conservatives on
doctrinal matters but have increased the efforts of their dioceses
in helping the poor, minorities and victims of AIDs, acquired
immunity deficiency syndrome.
   Tuesday's ceremony, known as a consistory, brought the number of
active Roman Catholic cardinals in the United States to five. Four
others are retired and three U.S. citizens who are cardinals work
outside the United States.
   Hickey, who previously served as bishop of Cleveland, said he
hoped as cardinal to focus more attention on Catholic education
because ``so many people know only snitches and snatches of their
faith.''
   Dozens of members of Detroit's large Polish-American community
came to Rome for the ceremony.
   ``A Polish bishop was becoming cardinal and we've got a Polish
pope,'' said Raymond Gientke, 65, of Northville, Mich. ``The time
was right.''
   Ethel Crawford of Detroit, 61, said: ``It was indescribable.''
   Szoka, a native of Grand Rapids, Mich., was ordained in 1954 and
became bishop of Gaylord, Mich. in 1971. He was made leader of the
Detroit archdiocese's 1.2 million Roman Catholics in 1981.
   Hickey was born in Midland, Mich., in 1920. He became archbishop
of Washington in 1980.

   What does Anton Mosimann, who is from Switzerland,
serve his friends after receiving an award from the French
government for promoting French cuisine in London?
   A very British meal of roast pork sausages and potato salad.
   Mosimann, recognized as the inventor four years ago of cuisine
naturelle, received the Chevalier de l'Ordre du Merite Agricole, or
Knight of the Order of Agriculture Merit, on Monday evening at his
new private London dining club.
   Cuisine naturelle eliminates oil, butter, cream and alcohol from
cooking and uses salt and sugar sparingly.
   To celebrate, Mosimann invited 40 sou chefs who worked with him
during his 13 years as maitre chef des cuisines at the Dorchester,
which he left earlier this year. Many now are executive chefs at
other London hotels.
   ``The menu tonight will not be cuisine naturelle but what you
serve when you have friends and chefs coming for dinner,'' Mosimann
said after accepting the award from Philippe Balny, agriculture
attache at the French Embassy.
   The first course was spicy potted Cornish crab and shrimps,
followed by the sausages with potato salad, a selection of Swiss
cheeses, bread and butter pudding, and coffee and sweetmeats.

   They're part of an effort to attract young readers.
   ``Some people who don't read very well feel a little leery of
approaching a librarian,'' said Irene Ruiz, librarian at the West
branch. ``So they pick up something that is a little easier for
them to read.''
   The West branch has received its first monthly shipment of 40
comic books, including ``Fraggle Rock'' and ``Undercover with the
Justice League International.'' The comics will be available as
soon as they're entered into library computers.
   Some branch libraries already have comic books, but the decision
is left to each librarian, said Daniel Bradbury, director of the
libraries.
   ``Some librarians are a little apprehensive,'' Bradbury said.
``They feel that comic books are less respectable, perhaps, than a

   Hollywood star Tony Curtis on Tuesday
launched a foundation to restore two major Hungarian synagogues and
1,300 Jewish cemeteries and to revitalize Jewish life in this
communist country.
   The Emanuel Foundation for Hungarian Culture, which Curtis
dedicated to the memories of 600,000 Jewish Holocaust victims in
Hungary, plans to start raising money to repair the synagogues and
other institutions.
   The Dohany-Utca synagogue in downtown Budapest, a Reformed
temple targeted for renewal, is central Europe's largest. The
Orthodox Kazinczy-Utca synagogue also is to be refurbished.
   Some 80,000 Jews live in Hungary, the largest such community in
central Europe.
   Curtis, 63, was born in New York in a Jewish family which
emigrated from Hungary to the United States in the early 1920s. The
foundation is named after his father.
   ``I feel happy and privileged to be here,'' said Curtis,
honorary president of the foundation. ``My father has made me a
Hungarian ... and anything I can do here makes me think of (him).''
   Leslie Keller, the foundation's executive president, said the
highlight of Curtis' visit will be a ground-breaking ceremony near
the Dohani-Utca synagogue on July 3 for a memorial to Holocaust
victims and heroes.

   Miss America, Kay Lani Rae Rafko,
hopes to produce her own beauty pageant one day, but says she'd do
away with the swimsuit competition.
   Rafko, a former Miss Michigan from Monroe, said she didn't find
the bathing suit competition degrading, but said there are other
ways to judge physical fitness.
   ``I don't know if I consider myself a feminist,'' Rafko, 24,
said after speaking at a conference here Sunday. ``I do believe
women should be treated equally and have the same opportunities for
career advancement.''
   Rafko, a nurse, said she was upset when a contestant at the
recent Miss California pageant unfurled a banner proclaiming,
``Beauty pageants hurt all women.''
   Rafko said no other organization could have given her the career
opportunities she's earned as Miss America or the platform from
which she's been able to advance her profession and hospice
movement.
   Rafko plans to return to her former job as an oncology nurse in
Toledo, Ohio, after her reign ends.

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Explodes on School Bus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An IRA bomb exploded Tuesday in
a school bus carrying 12 Protestant and Roman Catholic students,
seriously injuring one of them and the driver, a part-time soldier.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army said in a message to the
media it planted the bomb but would hold an investigation because a
civilian had been ``regrettably injured,'' a tacit acknowledgement
the attack went awry.
   The seriously injured girl, Gillian Latimer, 14, underwent
emergency surgery in Enniskillen, 10 miles from the blast, and was
then transferred to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, 70 miles
away, police said.
   She was in the intensive care unit with chest injuries and a
broken arm, the hospital said.
   Four other children, the youngest being 12 years old, were
treated for minor cuts and bruises and shock. The driver, a member
of the Ulster Defense Regiment militia, who was not immediately
identified, was cut in the face and eyes by flying glass.
   The girls were members of both the province's Protestant
majority and Roman Catholic minority.
   ``The bus was coming up to a stop, but it hadn't slowed down,
when there was a big bang,'' said Madonna Murphy, 18, a Catholic
pupil on the bus.
   ``Glass was everywhere and some of the girls didn't know what
had happened. I went down to the back to comfort the wee ones, who
were frightened and crying. The I saw a girl behind me. Her arm was
just hanging there, and I could see blood coming through her
blouse.''
   Miss Murphy added: ``I hope this doesn't drive the Protestants
and Catholics apart in Enniskillen. That is the only aim this bomb
would have but we won't let it work.''
   An IRA bomb in Enniskillen killed 12 Protestants attending a war
memorial service in November.
   Dr. Brian Mawhinney, education minister of the province, said:
``There can be no excuse, no attempt to justify, no cynical apology
from the men of violence. Northern Ireland is a God-fearing
province and it's quite clear what the IRA means by `Suffer little
children.'''
   Police said the bomb apparently was put in the front of the bus
while parked overnight outside a school in Maguiresbridge in County
Fermanagh, near the border with the Irish Republic. They said it
was probably meant to explode before the driver began collecting
children to drive them to school in Enniskillen.
   The bomb, with 2-3 pounds of explosives, went off after the bus
had been en route for half an hour.
   Police said the driver, despite his injuries, carried the badly
injured girl to the rear of the bus and gave her mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation before ambulances arrived.
   The Ulster Defense Regiment is recruited in Northern Ireland to
assist the British army and 175 of its members have been killed
since the IRA launched its violent campaign in 1969 to force a
British withdrawal from the province. More than 2,650 civilians,
police and soldiers have been killed in the conflict.
   Police said the IRA unit that planted the Enniskillen bomb in
November was likely to have been the same which bombed the school
bus and it might be based across the border in the Irish Republic.

   A group of property owners filed a
damage lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of the thousands forced to
evacuate their homes after a train derailment and phosphorus fire.
   Named as defendants in the Christian County Circuit Court
lawsuit were CSX Corp. and a subsidiary, CSX Transportation Inc.
   The complaint alleges negligence on the part of both companies,
said Tim Futrell, attorney for the nine plaintiffs, residents of
the Crofton and Nortonville areas.
   ``We are talking in terms of hundreds of millons of dollars in
damages,'' Futrell said. ``Under the rules of civil procedure, you
are not permitted to specify a specific amount in the complaint.''
   Futrell said he believed at least 15,000 people could be
affected by the case, noting that the accident on June 22 drove
about that many people from their homes in seven western Kentucky
counties.
   Lloyd Lewis, spokesman for CSX Transportation, said Tuesday he
had no comment.
   A CXS Transportation tanker carrying phosphorus was among 34
that left the tracks in a ravine near Crofton. The phosphorus
spilled from the ruptured tanker and burned more than 12 hours
after the crash.
   There was no fatalities.
   Futrell said one of the ``reasons we are filing so quickly is
because CSX has dispatched representatives to the area to get
people to sign releases for a pittance of what they are due.''
   Futrell said some people complained about scratching and itching
and difficulty in breathing, and he said there was damage to
tobacco and hay crops ``and perhaps to the soil itself.''
   ``Virtually all of the plaintiffs were displaced for at least
three days. They lost wages and will be seeking compensation for
that.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb believed planted by a left-wing
terrorist group exploded Tuesday and killed the U.S. military
attache in Greece, hurling his armor-plated car off the road,
authorities said.
   U.S. Navy Capt. William Nordeen was driving to work when the
blast threw his sedan across the small tree-lined street and lodged
it in a steel fence, police said.
   The victim's body was found several yards away in the front yard
of an abandoned house.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast,
but senior police officials said they believed it to be the work of
November 17, a left-wing urban terrorist group blamed for 11
political assassinations in the past 13 years.
   The United States and Greece both condemned the bombing, which
came a a crucial time in relations between the two countries.
   ``The United States condemns this terrorist outrage in the
strongest possible terms,'' said chief Pentagon spokesman Dan
Howard. ``It was a senseless and cowardly murder of a highly
regarded U.S. military officer.''
   Sotiris Kostopoulos, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Carolos
Papoulias, said the Greek government voiced ``disgust at the
murder.''
   ``All Greeks, irrespective of their political leanings,
unreservedly condemn the would-be underminers of the country's
institutions and democratic normality,'' Kostopoulos told reporters
at a news briefing.
   Police said the Toyota packed with explosives was parked 100
yards from Nordeen's two-story home in the northern suburb of
Kifissia, where many American and foreign diplomats live.
   The blast shattered windows and blew out doors in surrounding
houses. Trees, fences and walls were blacked by smoke after fire
engulfed both cars.
   ``We heard a tremendous bang and the house rocked back and
forth. Pieces of the car were thrown into our house,'' Panagia
Kapodistria said. The car's twisted rear axle lay in her front yard.
   Nordeen, 51, of Centuria, Wis., was due to retire in August
after 30 years in the Navy, said his sister, Carla Anderson. He had
been stationed in Greece for three years.
   He previously served as assistant naval inspector in Washington,
with the U.S. Fleet in the Pacific and at the Jacksonville, Fla.,
naval air base. He is survived by his wife and 12-year-old daughter.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the U.S. government would work with Greek authorities to ``bring
the murderers to justice.''
   A senior police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he believed it was staged by November 17, named for the day in
1973 when troops crushed a student rebellion at Athens Polytechnic
University against the right-wing dictatorship.
   ``I don't think anybody except November 17 had the expertise to
pull off something like this,'' the officer said.
   A police explosives expert who refused to be identified said
Tuesday's killing was ``perfectly planned and very well executed.
... They thought of every detail.''
   The expert said bags of cement were piled against one side of
the booby-trapped vehicle so the explosion's full force would be
directed toward Nordeen's car. He said the blast probably was
detonated by remote-controlled device.
   November 17 carried out a similar attack against the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency's local chief in January, but George Carros
survived after the radio-controlled bomb in a trash can outside his
home failed to go off.
   The group has claimed responsibility for 11 assassinations since
1975, including the 1983 shooting of U.S. Navy Capt. George Tsantes
and the 1975 assassination of Richard Welch, CIA station chief in
Athens.
   November 17 is named for the day in 1973 when troops crushed a
student uprising against the 1967-74 Greek military dictatorship.
   Nordeen's killing came four days after Greek and American
negotiators ended a seventh round of talks on a new U.S. bases
agreement to replace an accord that expires Dec. 31, 1988. The
talks ended without reports of significant progress.
   The United States has operated four military bases in Greece
since the 1950s _ two near Athens and two on the island of Crete.
The five-year accord expires in December 1988.

<HEAD>US Disturbed Over Stinger Missiles in Hands of Small Gulf Country</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The tiny Persian Gulf sheikdom of Qatar
illegally obtained Stinger missiles from unnamed ``third parties''
and the United States is demanding an explanation and return of the
weapons, the State Department said Tuesday.
   The incident could upset traditionally good relations between
Washington and the oil-rich Arab country. It is believed the
shoulder-fired Stingers, often called a terrorist's dream because
they are easy to handle, were intended for Afghan rebels, a U.S.
official said.
   The official, who spoke only on condition on anomymity, said
that might mean the U.S.-made missiles were turned over to Iran,
which then gave them to Qatar.
   Many of the guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul
government with U.S. support are Moslem fundamentalists with at
least a theological and philosopohical kinship to the Iranians.
   The Middle East and Persian Gulf already were awash in a rising
tide of missiles when reports of Stingers in Qatar sent Assistant
Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy to Doha last week for an
explanation.
   The Soviet Union, ignoring U.S. appeals, has sold a variety of
missiles to Syria and Libya, while China has provided Saudi Arabia
with new rockets. This has alarmed both the United States and
Israel, which is seeking a new surface-to-air missile as a
counterbalance.
   Under U.S. law, Stingers can be transferred to a third party
only with American consent. The missiles have been used effectively
by Afghan rebels against Soviet helicopters and other targets, and
are credited with hastening a decision by Moscow to withdraw the
Red Army after more than eight years of occupation.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Qatar
had refused to supply details of its acquisition of the Stingers.
``We have been intensively involved in discussions with the Qataris
on their acquisition of Stingers through unauthorized sources,''
the U.S. official said.
   ``These Stingers were not procured from the U.S. government, and
must have been obtained illegally from third parties,'' Redman
said. ``That they were procured improperly, and are in Qatar
without authorization are matters of great concern to us. We are
seeking the return of these missiles.''
   He said he did not know how many missiles were involved. ``We're
trying to determine how and from where Qatar obtained the
Stingers,'' he said. ``We still don't have any conclusions as to
where the Stingers came from. We still need answers from the
Qataris, and that's the reason we're having these discussions, to
see if we can get those answers.''

<HEAD>S&L Lobbyist Faults Reagan Administration For Industry's Financial
Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, in its zeal to
deregulate financial institutions, laid out the welcome mat for
``high fliers'' and must share the blame for troubles facing the
savings and loan industry, an industry official said Tuesday.
   Theo Pitt Jr., chairman of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the industry's largest lobbying group, said that the
administration bungled the deregulation of savings and loans by
failing to provide for beefed-up auditing supervision.
   In a speech to the league's annual regulatory conference, Pitt
said the administration had turned down repeated requests for more
examiners from the the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the agency
which regulates the S&L industry.
   ``It was obvious to all but those in a position to do something
about it that a deregulated marketplace would require a larger
federal police force,'' Pitt said.
   By refusing requests for more federal examiners, Pitt said the
administration in effect ``laid out the welcome mat for the high
fliers. They said: `Come on in. No one's watching.' And come they
did .. and they ran amok in the absence of government supervision.''
   The savings and loan industry suffered losses totaling $3.8
billion in the first three months of this year, more than half of
the record $6.8 billin the industry lost for all of 1987.
   Pitt said that poor management and depressed economic conditions
in the Southwest had contributed to the industry's woes.
   But he said, ``Those that got in trouble because of fraud and
mismanagement were invited to do so largely as the result of a
poorly planned, poorly executed deregulation process _ at both the
state and federal levels.''
   ``The administration plunged headlong into deregulation in the
early years of this decade. They went at it with a vengeance. And
they went at it in a lopsided fashion,'' he said.
   For many years, the amounts that savings and loans could pay
depositors was capped, and in the 1980s those caps were gradually
removed.
   Pitt said that it wasn't until three years after the start of
interest rate deregulation that federal officials got around to
granting institutions the power to offer variable-rate mortgage
loans. Pitt said this created an imbalance between the cost S&Ls
were having to pay for funds and the amount they were allowed to
earn on their loans which translated into an estimated loss of $12
billion for the industry.
   Pitt said that the legislatures in some states were at fault as
well by expanding the investment authority of their state-chartered
institutions far beyond the traditional housing-finance mission of
the S&L industry.
   The largest number of financially troubled institutions are in
Texas and California, two states where lawmakers granted S&Ls broad
authority to venture into risky investments outside of the
traditional home mortgages the industry was created to handle.
   Pitt said there was a limit to how much the nation's healthy
S&Ls could continue to pay toward making up the shortfall in the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the agency which insures
deposits up to $100,000. Because of the S&L troubles, the insurance
fund ended 1987 with a negative net worth of $13.7 billion, more
than double the deficit at the end of 1986.
   Congress approved a measure to raise $10.8 billion for the
ailing insurance fund through the sale of bonds with the bonds to
be paid off by increased assessments on healthy S&Ls.
   But Pitt said healthy S&Ls are now being asked to pay 2{ times
what competing banks must pay for deposit insurance.
   ``What looms before us is the prospect of Vampire Economics ...
a prescription for FSLIC's problems that would drain away our
capital, the very life blood of our system of depository
institutions,'' Pitt said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis blasted Reagan
administration housing cuts on Tuesday and promised to spend $3
billion on housing if elected to help people achieve ``one piece of
the American dream.''
   Dukakis spoke to reporters at the site of a former Boston public
school that was razed to make way for more than a dozen homes sold
through a state program offering subsidized mortgages to low- and
moderate-income families buying their first home.
   He endorsed a Senate housing bill sponsored by California Sen.
Alan Cranston, who accompanied Dukakis to the event. Dukakis said
the bill provided for a ``a federal commitment, a re-commitment to
affordable housing'' and promised to provide $3 billion in funding
for the legislation within three years of taking office.
   He touted provisions of the bill calling for low-interest
mortgages for new homes and renovation of existing housing stock
and said similar programs he began in Massachusetts had proven
highly successful.
   ``I don't see how we can talk about a bright economic future for
America if it doesn't include decent and affordable housing for all
our citizens,'' Dukakis said in a speech at a housing forum before
visiting the neighborhood.
   Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential nominee, dismissed
speculation about his search for a running mate by saying ``there's
only one guy who knows what's going on and that's the guy you're
looking at.''
   But he refused to rule out Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn for the No. 2
spot on the ticket despite Nunn's insistence that he is not
interested. He also said Florida Sen. Bob Graham remained in
contention.
   The Massachusetts governor planned to meet Wednesday in
Washington with about 30 Democratic senators, including Nunn and
Graham, before a Midwest campaign swing. ``Some of them may be
possibilities,'' for the vice presidential nomination,'' Dukakis
said.
   ``I don't know,'' he answered when asked when he would make a
decision. ``I'm enjoying the process and I hope you are too.''
   Cranston said the ``betting on Capitol Hill seems to be John
Glenn and Llyod Bentsen as the front-runners'' to share the ticket
with Dukakis, with Nunn running third in the speculation. Glenn and
Bentsen are senators from Ohio and Texas, respectively.
   Dukakis laughed when told of Cranston's assessment. ``I'm not a
betting man,'' he said.
   Dukakis blamed the lack of affordable housing on a 90 percent
cut in federal spending on housing by Reagan and said there were
2.5 million homeless people in the United States ``largely because
of the cuts in federal commitment to affordable housing.''
   ``I don't know that he has a policy,'' Dukakis said when asked
about the housing policies of Vice President George Bush, the
certain Republican nominee.
   At the housing forum, Dukakis said a national housing program
should include some goverment support, either through loans and
grants or through other incentives, such as donating land or
granting zoning variances.
   ``It takes partnership, it takes commitment, it takes an
understanding that we are one nation,'' Dukakis.
   ``One piece of the American dream is an affordable home or
apartment,'' Dukakis said. ``And anything less than that just won't
do.''
   Dukakis cited efforts by some unions to invest their pension
funds in housing developments that guarantee a percentage of the
units to low- and moderate-income families.
   ``It creates good jobs at union scale and does it in a way that
creates good housing,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Removes Residency Requirement for District Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House killed a residency requirement for
District of Columbia police officers on Tuesday, reflecting
congressional concern that the rule was hurting recruiting while
the crime rate went up.
   In a rare instance in which Congress intervened in an issue
normally handled at the local level, an amendment that scuttled the
city's eight-year-old residency requirement was approved by a
246-163 vote.
   The measure, offered by Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., came as the
House considered the city's $3.2 billion budget for fiscal 1989.
   Parris had intended to replace the residency rule with a system
giving hiring preference to city residents, but Democrats moved
that the vote be contested only on the residency issue. Parris'
amendment passed after the preferential hiring language was dropped.
   ``The message trying to be conveyed is that there are problems
in public safety,'' Parris said after the vote.
   D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, a steadfast supporter of the residency
rule, was not immediately available for comment.
   ``We look forward to seeing an improvement in the numbers and
quality of the people joining the police department,'' said Gary
Hankins, spokesman for the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of
Police. ``We remain convinced this will substantially improve
public safety in the District of Columbia.''
   Parris' amendment will apply to all city positions, including
police and firefighters.
   Supporters of the residency requirement accused Parris of
meddling in city affairs. But he and other opponents of the
residency rule claimed that a combination of increasing crime and
decreasing police applications equaled a looming public safety
problem in the nation's capital.
   Police statistics indicate crime has increased by 17 percent for
the first four months of 1988, compared with the same period a year
ago, and police blame an upsurge in drug-related violence for much
of the city's 146 homicides so far this year. There were 98
killings at this time last year, and 228 for all of 1987.
   Applications to the police department also are down. According
to police records, there were 3,100 applications in 1985, but just
591 last year. The city has 3,880 officers, but some members of
Congress long have favored expanding the police force to 5,100
members.
   Opponents of the residency rule argued that it severely
restricted the city's job applicant pool, particularly in crucial
public safety positions.
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., who chairs the House District of
Columbia Committee, said the House would become ``a super city
council'' if it voted to repeal the act, and Rep. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., suggested that the House wait for the District of
Columbia Council to act on the matter.
   The bill now moves to the Senate, where Parris said he expects
no opposition to the repeal of the residency requirement.

<HEAD>US, Angry with Mexico, Recalls Ambassador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An angry Reagan administration recalled its
ambassador from Mexico on Tuesday after Mexico released a Puerto
Rican separatist wanted by U.S. authorities for terrorist
activities.
   Mexican authorities freed William Morales, 37, from prison last
Friday and put him on a plane to Cuba, effectively erasing any
possibility of his extradition to the United States.
   The recall of Ambassador Charles Pilliod from Mexico City for
consultations was a sign of U.S. displeasure over the Mexican
action. State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman did not say
whether any retaliatory measures are planned. He described the
release as politically motivated.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was an outrage
for Mexico to release and deport to Cuba a man who had not yet
completed a prison sentence for the murder of a Mexican police
officer. Morales had been serving an eight-year prison term for the
1983 slaying.
   ``This decision is an inexplicable affront to otherwise
excellent U.S.-Mexican relations and a great blow to U.S. and
Mexican efforts to combat the scourge of international terrorism,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said the State Department had summoned the Mexican ambassador
to the United States, Jorge Espinosa de los Reyes, on Monday night
``and expressed our anger over the release of this convicted
terrorist.''
   Redman said Morales is an escaped U.S. prisoner who has been
sentenced to jail terms totaling more than 100 years. He was
implicated in over 50 bombings by a Puerto Rican separatist group
that from 1976 to 1978 resulted in the death and injury of many
individuals, the spokesman said.
   A U.S. Embassy official in Mexico City, insisting on anonymity,
said Mexico waited five days before informing the United States of
Morales' release.
   Mexico has described Morales as a political fighter who could
not be legally extradited to the United States because of a
bilateral treaty clause protecting political activists from
extradition.
   Redman said application of the provision to Morales was
``outrageous'' and undercuts the fight against terrorism by legal
means.
   ``It is inconceivable that an important friend such as Mexico
could find such violent acts to be a legitimate exercise of
political activity,'' he said.
   ``The decision is particularly offensive to us, because in
reversing the finding by the pertentent Mexican court that Morales
should be extradited, the action of the Mexican Foreign Ministry
could only have been taken for political reasons.''

<HEAD>Police Drag Away Protesters After Gorbachev Calls for Free

   Police Tuesday dragged off members of a
disgruntled ethnic group at one demonstration and herded away
political protesters at another, hours after Mikhail S. Gorbachev
called for greater freedom of expression.
   ``They took my husband!'' said a sobbing woman minutes after
police carried away about 200 fellow Crimean Tatars, who demand the
return of their historic homeland.
   The woman, in her 20s, said she came to Moscow from the city of
Krasnodar to demonstrate during the nationwide Communist Party
conference. She was arrested a few minutes later.
   A few blocks away in the Kremlin, Gorbachev had just endorsed
openness.
   ``I would like to dwell particularly on the political freedoms
that enable a person to express his opinion on any matter,'' the
Soviet leader told the conference in a keynote speech. ``The
implementation of these freedoms is a real guarantee that any
problem of public interest will be discussed from every angle.''
   But he also condemned ``attempts to use democratic rights for
undemocratic purposes,'' such as attempts to redraw borders and
establish political parties that would challenge the rule of the
Communists.
   Josef V. Stalin ordered the Crimean Tatars deported in May 1944
from their homes on the Crimean peninsula in the Ukrainian
republic. They were accused of betraying their country while the
Crimea was occupied by Nazi Germany.
   The government dropped the collective war crimes charges in 1967
but the Tatars were not allowed to return permanently to the Crimea.
   The Crimean Tatars, who number 250,000-350,000, are demanding
permission to resettle in their homeland.
   Police had put up steel barricades to prevent the Tatars from
demonstrating on a square on Gorky Street in Moscow's main shopping
district. The group gathered anyway, outside the barricades, during
an evening rush-hour rainstorm and unfurled banners demanding
return to the Crimea.
   Within seconds, plainclothes and uniformed police emerged from
nearby buses, grabbed the Crimean Tatars and dragged them onto the
vehicles. Some appeared to be injured.
   As the demonstrators were herded onto the crowded buses, they
shouted ``Homeland!'' Women screamed and clutched their children.
Then they, too, were taken away.
   A second group of Crimean Tatars arrived, but they also were
grabbed and hustled onto buses.
   Two officers told a reporter the protesters were not being
arrested or taken to a jail, but moved out of the area because they
were ``violating public order.''
   Some of the dozens of bystanders who watched the incident
shouted ``Gestapo!'' and ``Fascist idiots!'' at the police. Others
called the Tatars traitors.
   ``Take them all away!'' shouted one woman as police hunted down
and grabbed one of the demonstrators.
   About 15 minutes later a few blocks away, on Pushkin Square,
police rounded up seven members of the group called the Democratic
Union, witnesses said. Several remaining members of the group
addressed separate crowds of several dozen people to promote its
platform, which calls for a multiparty system.
   Bystanders argued about the merits of socialism and capitalism.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said the civil rights of Soviets need
to be preserved.
   ``The entire law-and-order structure of ours is called upon to
guarantee strict observance of the citizens' rights to the
inviolability of private life and the home, privacy of
correspondence, postal and telegraph messages,'' he said.
   The Soviet legal system must ensure that a person is innocent
until proven guilty and that all people get equal treatment before
the law, Gorbachev said.
   Those rights and the right to speak out on the issues before
Soviet society have been violated since the time of Stalin and must
be restored, he said.
   And in a reference to religious freedom, Gorbachev said, ``All
believers, irrespective of their faith, are equal citizens of the
Soviet Union,'' despite their differences with communism, which is
officially atheistic.

<HEAD>Ferret Owner Given Until July 14 To Produce Fuji</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANASSAS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a ferret authorities want to
test for rabies has been given until July 14 to find the missing
animal or return to jail.
   Jennifer Au, 19, spent much of last week in Prince William
County jail on contempt of court charges after she claimed she did
not know where the ferret was. The teen-ager was given the weekend
to find the animal, but faced another jail term when she returned
to the courthouse Monday without it.
   She was, however, allowed to remain free on a $1,000 personal
recognizance bond as Circuit Judge Percy Thornton Jr. set the
mid-July deadline for the animal's return.
   Miss Au has argued that she does not know where to find the
ferret, which may have bitten a boy on June 3 in a pet shop where
she worked. A.J. Simpson, 5, will receive the last of six
precautionary rabies shots on July 9.
   ``I think she was making a substantially greater effort to find
it when she was in jail or when she had the threat of jail hanging
over her,'' said Wenda Travers, assistant commonwealth's attorney.
   Miss Au showed Thornton logs of the telephone calls she had made
in efforts to find the ferret since Friday, when she was freed
after five days in the Manassas-Prince William Adult Detention
Center on orders to bring the animal to court Monday.
   Miss Au has said the female ferret named Fuji was not the one
that bit the boy at Manassas Mall pet center. Two other ferrets
that were in the cage tested negative for rabies in a process that
requires the decapitation of the animals.
   Miss Au, a Virginia Tech student, took the animal from the pet
store and refused to give it up for testing. She said she left it
to be picked up by an unidentified animal rights activist before
Thornton ordered its surrender.
   The court became involved in the case after Prince William
Health Director Dr. Jared Florance filed a lawsuit to get the third
ferret for testing.

<HEAD>Airbus 320s Return to Flight as Inquiry Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air France put its Airbus 320 jetliners back in the
air Tuesday as investigators studied burned wreckage of the
sophisticated aircraft to determine whether human or technical
error caused a crash at an air show.
   British Airways also expressed confidence in its two A320s and
put them back on the schedule Tuesday after a two-day suspension.
   Three people died and 50 were injured Sunday when an A320 with
133 people aboard buzzed the airfield at 30 feet and failed the
climb. The plane crashed into a wooded area near Mulhouse, in
eastern France.
   An inquiry commission was set up ``to study the circumstances,
research the causes and gather information'' about the crash, the
government publication Journal Officiel said Tuesday. The panel is
headed by Claude Bechet, a pilot and member of the Transport
Ministry's office of accident inquests.
   The pilot's union protested because it was not represented on
the panel.
   At a news conference Monday, the Transport Ministry defended the
fully computerized jet and said there was no reason to doubt the
plane's performance. Airbus Industrie, the four-nation European
consortium that makes the Airbus 320, said there were indications
of human error.
   Pilot Michel Hasseline was quoted by the French press after the
accident as saying the aircraft did not respond to his efforts to
increase power.
   Preliminary investigations showed the Airbus was flying too low,
Civil Aviation Authority chief Daniel Tennenbaum said. He said the
plane required eight seconds to respond to the command of the
pilot, who only had five seconds to maneuver because of the
altitude.
   Christian Roger, president of the Air France pilot's union, said
the engines may have failed to restart at Hasseline's command.
   State prosecutor Jean Volff said the minimum altitude for such
condition was 100 feet and that the pilot ``had disconnected the
automatic controls at the moment of the accident and was in manual
control.'' He did not elaborate.
   The pilots' and mechanics' unions contend that safety requires a
third officer in the cockpit of A320s _ in addition to pilot and
co-pilot _ in case of a failure of the state-of-the-art computers.
   In a joint statement Tuesday, they said the inquiry panel was
composed of supporters of the two-crew system.
   Air France's first A320 flight since Sunday's suspension took
off from Paris bound for Duesseldorf and Berlin with 102 passengers
aboard. Seven people who had reservations did not claim their
seats, a normal ``no-show'' rate for a European route of this type,
the company said.
   Britain and France have a big stake in the 17-year-old Airbus
Industrie, which has broken into the U.S.-dominated aircraft market
and employs about 150,000 people throughout Europe. Airbus, whose
other members are West Germany and Spain, says it has more than 500
orders or letters of intent to purchase the narrow-bodied,
fuel-efficient plane.
   There are no A320s in operation in the United States. Northwest
Airlines has ordered 100, and Pan American World Airways has 16 on
order with an option to buy 34 more.

<HEAD>Police: Operator Opened Drawbridge Suddenly, Sends Driver Leaping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motorist was forced to fly eight
feet across the Intracoastal Waterway to avoid falling through a
drawbridge that unexpectedly opened, police said.
   The 16-year-old bridge operator, William Sills, did not lower
warning gates before raising the bridge Saturday night, police
said. It was the second _ and last _ day on the job for the
operator who had listed his age as 19 on his application, a
supervisor at the company which operates the bridge said Tuesday.
   The gates are supposed to be lowered before the bridge is
opened, except in emergencies.
   ``I can't believe how close we were to getting killed,'' said
Gary Darras, 34, of Pompano Beach, whose car lept across the
yawning bridge and slammed down on the other side.
   Darras, who was returning from the grocery store, said he was
near the middle of the bridge when it began opening. ``There were
no bells and no whistles,'' he said.
   The frame of his 1978 Lincoln Town Car was twisted and the car
lost its oil pan and exhaust system when it crunched into the
grating on the other side, police said.
   Chuck Joyce, a spokesman for the Florida Department of
Transportation, said the department had asked for a report on the
incident from Global Contracts Services, a private company under
contract to operate the bridge.
   Joyce said the contract did not set a minimum age for a
bridgetender.
   ``When we hired them we said `you're responsible for the
bridge,''' Joyce said. ``We don't stipulate who can and can't work
there.''
   No charges have been filed.
   Sills had just completed a one-week training course, said the
supervisor, who spoke on the condition he not be identified.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Wants New Category Of Ice Cream: `Lite'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national consumer group said Tuesday it will
ask federal regulators to create a new standard for lower-fat
``lite'' ice cream sold by the dip or by the carton.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said the Food and Drug Administration will be asked
to set up three standards: regular ice cream having at least 10
percent milkfat; lite ice cream, 4 percent to 6 percent; and ice
milk, 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Currently, an ice-cream type dessert with less than 7 percent
fat must be labeled as ice milk, and the term ``ice cream'' is
reserved for those having a fat content of at least 10 percent, she
said.
   ``Historically, ice milk has been the stepchild of the ice cream
industry,'' Haas said. ``Few are aware of its comparative
nutritional benefits. Yet FDA regulations do not permit marketing
of a product called ``lite ice cream'' which could be used to
stimulate sales of all lower-fat ice cream products.''
   Also, the Public Voice petition to FDA asks that manufacturers
who use the new standard would have to provide nutrition
information on the package. And the label would have to state as a
percentage how much less fat the lite product is compared with
regular ice cream.
   In other words, lite ice cream would contain 40 percent to 60
percent less fat than ice cream, and ice milk's margin would be
even greater.
   Haas said nearly a dozen health and medical groups have endorsed
the proposal for lite ice cream.
   Support also came from two trade associations, the Milk Industry
Foundation and the International Ice Cream Association. A
spokeswoman, Becky Davenport, said the associations planned to file
their own petition with FDA, but would call for a slightly greater
range of fat in lite ice cream _ 5 percent to about 7 percent.
   The National Milk Producers Federation, which represents dairy
farmers and their cooperatives, has not had an opportunity to study
the proposal by Public Voice and would reserve comment until later,
said spokeswoman Doni Dondero.
   Public Voice is tackling ice cream after recently succeeding in
getting the Agriculture Department to change the name of leaner
``U.S. Good'' beef to ``U.S. Select'' as a way of attracting more
favorable consumer attention.
   ``Creation of a lower-fat ice cream standard would be good for
everyone,'' Haas said. ``Consumers would be better informed about a
healthier dessert choice. The industry would benefit from the
increased marketability of a product with clear nutritional
advantages.''
   How about the taste of lite ice cream?
   ``I've tasted it, and it's just as good,'' Haas said in a
telephone interview. ``It's a lighter-feeling taste, it's not as
rich. But I think the American palate has become light, and the
health concerns are more important than the gooey concerns.''
   Lite ice cream would be most distinctive eaten in a cone or
otherwise unadorned. That way, she said, moving down from ice cream
with 10 percent to 15 percent fat to 5 percent or 6 percent would
produce ``a noticeable difference'' to the eater.
   But if used in a sundae or banana split, with plenty of
toppings, lite ice cream becomes one of those ``gooey concerns''
and probably wouldn't be noticed.

   Several Republican senators filed a bill
Tuesday to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet
status, saying the legislation was meant as a signal to the next
administration that the environment should get more attention.
   ``We want environmental protection to receive a higher priority
than it has in the past,'' said the author of the bill, Sen. David
Durenberger, R-Minn.
   The bill would not change the duties or offices of the
government's largest regulatory agency, but would upgrade it to the
``Department of Environmental Protection'' headed by a secretary.
   The senators conceded that they had little hope of quick
passage, but said the bill was intended to prod presidential
candidates into dealing with environmental issues.
   ``I very much want George Bush and Michael Dukakis to address
environmental issues in their campaigns. Putting this issue before
them will very much encourage that debate,'' said Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., another sponsor.
   Heinz declined to criticize President Reagan's environmental
record, something Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential
nominee, has done on occasion and many environmental groups do
frequently.
   ``Given where the United States was in 1980 and 1981 and
(Reagan's) experience, I think the president would agree concern
over the environment has sharply increased in the past six or eight
years. That's true for him and it's true for us,'' Heinz said.
   But Durenberger said, ``We want the next president of the United
States directly involved in making environmental policy,''
something Reagan has not generally been involved in.
   The agency needs the clout that Cabinet status can bring, both
against other departments of the government, in international
negotiations, in seeking larger budgets and in pressing its views
on Congress, the senators said.
   Though EPA led the development of the administration's position
to seek large worldwide cuts in emissions of chemicals that destroy
the earth's protective ozone layer and won a treaty last year
calling for a 50 percent reduction by 1998, ``it was more difficult
from the position of an agency than it would have been at the
Cabinet level,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   In addition to Chafee, Heinz and Durenberger, the other initial
sponsors included Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn. and Sen. Robert
Stafford, R-Vt. All but Stafford are seeking re-election in
November.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas, in a comment relayed by
spokesman David Cohen, said he had no complaints about his agency's
clout in the current administration but added: ``The role of this
agency has grown significantly and we should sit at the same table
with the rest of the major players. This proposal strikes me as an
excellent idea.''
   EPA has about 14,000 employees and spends $3.1 billion a year,
roughly half of that on the ``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup
program. It distributes more than $2 billion a year more in grants
for sewage plants.
   The agency administers 13 major laws and through them is the
chief overseer of massive pollution control and abatement spending
by states, cities, businesses and consumers that by some estimates
totals as much as $70 billion per year.
   EPA was formed by President Nixon's executive order in 1970 out
of pieces of the Agriculture, Interior and Health, Education and
Welfare departments and the Atomic Energy Commission.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday proposed a broad
but vague separation of powers between the Communist Party and
government legislatures that would be made stronger but remain
subordinate to the party.
   Gorbachev called for a new, full-time national legislature to be
headed by a president with power to oversee foreign and defense
policy and appoint the head of government.
   But the Communist Party chief said legislative bodies, or
soviets, still would be expected to implement party policies, and
he appeared to limit their independent development by recommending
that the positions of local party head and government leader be
held by the same person.
   ``The party's economic, social and ethnic policy should be
carried out above all via the Soviets of Peoples' Deputies as the
organs of popular government,'' Gorbachev told the opening session
of 5,000 delegates to the first Communist Party conference in 47
years.
   Neither Gorbachev nor Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, a
leading theorist of Gorbachev's reforms who spoke later at a news
conference, made clear whether the party general secretary also
would be president.
   Currently, the head of the party is the most powerful person in
the Soviet Unionl.
   As described by Gorbachev, the new presidency would be more
powerful than that currently held by Andrei A. Gromyko. At times,
the Communist Party leader also has been president but the head of
state is traditionally a ceremonial post.
   ``Specifically, the president could exercise overall guidance in
the drafting of legislation and of major socio-economic programs,
decide on the key issues of foreign policy ..., chair the Defense
Council'' and nominate the premier, Gorbachev said.
   Outlining plans to strengthen the legislatures, Gorbachev
proposed election of a new 2,250-member Congress of Deputies that
would meet annually to review constitutional, economic and social
questions.
   Its members, elected from the same constituencies that now make
up the two house of parliament, plus new representatives of trade
unions, artistic, scientific, party and other special interest
organizations, would serve five-year terms.
   That could give intellectuals, the strongest supporters of
Gorbachev's reforms, a stronger voice in the chamber.
   Yakovlev said not all members of the new chamber need be party
members.
   The Congress of Deputies would choose a permanent legislature of
400-450 members, to be headed by a president chosen in a secret
ballot by the entire Congress of Deputies.
   Selection of the president is ``the prerogative of the peoples'
deputies, and they can elect anyone they choose,'' Yakovlev said.
   The new parliament would be known by the same name as the
current nominal parliament, the Supreme Soviet. However, ``it would
consider and decide all legislative, administrative and monitoring
questions,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Communist Party leader said legislation implementing the new
arrangement could be submitted to the existing parliament as early
as fall and elections held as soon as next spring.
   Yakovlev said it inevitably would lead to a redistribution of
power in the Soviet system.
   ``All legislative authority will be invested in the soviets. The
executive power would go to the government and its executive organs
locally. The party will reserve the right and the function as the
political vanguard,'' he said.
   The new, smaller Supreme Soviet would have the right to review
appointment of government ministers, he said.
   The new president and the members of the new Congress of
Deputies could be recalled after election, Gorbachev said, without
making clear how this might happen.
   Gorbachev recommended that the local party leader also head the
local governing council in order to enhance the council's prestige
and increase accountability. But that apparently contradicted
passages in his speech advocating that the party get out of
day-to-day administration.
   Councils could decide against electing the party leader, but in
most cases the proposal presumably would ensure party control of
the government councils.
   Gorbachev advocated a more open style of debate for the new
permanent legislature and also suggested its decisions need not be
unanimous, as those of the current 1,500-member Supreme Soviet
traditionally have been.
   Apparently mindful of recent ethnic strife in the Soviet Union,
Gorbachev urged the Council of Nationalities to become a watchdog
on ethnic issues, monitoring legislation and policies in the
nation's 15 republics.

   Michael Dukakis' campaign has asked for an
exhaustive amount of information from potential Democratic vice
presidential contenders, including driving records and academic
transcripts in addition to financial material, sources said Tuesday.
   In the case of John Glenn, officials said, Dukakis' close friend
Paul Brountas is delving into the senator's 1984 presidential
campaign, seeking information about a lingering $2.4 million debt
and a staff upheaval that came just before the Iowa caucuses.
   Dukakis sought to dampen speculation about his search for a
running mate during the day, telling reporters, ``there's only one
guy who knows what's going on.''
   He wasn't saying much more about the subject.
   But other officials said Dukakis' campaign has requested
detailed financial and health information on several possible
running mates. In addition to income tax returns, the candidates
have been asked for academic records, driving records, military
records and health records, among other material.
   Presumably, Dukakis' aides have asked for the wealth of
information to minimize the prospects for an embarrassing
disclosure once the choice has been made and announced. Past
campaigns have been damaged by controversy over a running mate,
most recently in 1984, when questions were raised about the
finances of Geraldine Ferraro's husband, John Zacarro.
   Dukakis' reluctance to discuss the search didn't stop the
ceaseless speculation in advance of the governor's trip to
Washington on Wednesday in which he is expected to meet with
several potential running mates, as well as 30 or so other members
of the Senate.
   Dukakis' aides have solicited information from several
prospective candidates, including Jesse Jackson and Glenn, as well
as Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas and Reps. Thomas Foley of Washington, Richard
Gephardt of Washington and Lee Hamilton of Indiana. The names of
Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
also have cropped up.
   Members of Congress have urged Dukakis to look beyond Jackson in
picking a running mate, sources have said, and campaign aides say
they doubt the spot will be offered to him. Foley has reportedly
declined to provide the requested information.
   The remainder of the list under consideration is comprised of
moderate to conservative lawmakers from the South or Midwest _
precisely the type of running mate that many members of Congress
have urged Dukakis to pick.
   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey has taken himself out of the
running, and Dukakis said earlier in the week ``I respect that.''
   But Dukakis declined during the day to rule out Nunn even though
the senator has relayed word that he does not intend to return the
questionnaire sent out by the campaign. Nunn is one of several
senators expected to meet with Dukakis on Wednesday.
   Dukakis also told reporters that Graham remains under
consideration, although other sources have indicated in recent days
that the senator might have fallen slightly out of favor when he
publicly confirmed last week that he had been asked to provide
information about himself.
   Dukakis and his aides have tried to conduct their search in as
much privacy as possible, and aides have been ordered not to talk
to reporters about the subject.
   Thus Bob Farmer, Dukakis' fund-raiser, responded ``no comment''
when asked whether he had been asked about his role in Glenn's
abortive 1984 campaign.
   But sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said other
associates of Glenn had been asked detailed questions about the
1984 presidential campaign and the senator's involvement in a
campaign staff shake-up several weeks before the primary season
began.
   In addition, sources said Dukakis' aides want to know what they
can about the circumstances surrounding the $2.4 million debt
remaining from the campaign.
   The Federal Election Commission last year settled a lawsuit in
which it originally charged that $2 million in bank loans during
the Glenn campaign were illegal because there was no assurance they
would be repaid.
   Under the settlement, the FEC dismissed all claims against the
senator, while the campaign committee agreed to make a $4,000
paymenmt to the federal agency after the loans are repaid.

<HEAD>Nuclear Testing Negotiator Says Talks Won Substantial Data
Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief U.S. negotiator at talks with the
Soviet Union on nuclear testing said Tuesday that a four-month
negotiating round was ending with high hopes on both sides and with
a substantial exchange of testing data.
   The negotiator, Ambassador C. Paul Robinson, told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee that both U.S. and Soviet negotiators
believe treaties limiting the size of underground nuclear weapons
tests and of nuclear tests for peaceful purposes can be ready for
ratification by the end of this year.
   ``There is a sense of history among those involved'' in the
Geneva negotiations, the second round of which ended Tuesday, said
Robinson. ``None of them believed this could be possible.''
   On their final day of talks, the two sides exchanged historical
data on yields of past nuclear tests, seismic recordings and
associated geological information, he said.
   The two sides negotiated the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 1974
and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty in 1976, but neither has
been ratified. The Geneva talks have been aimed at reaching new
verification agreements on the two pacts so they can finally be
ratified.
   The treaties prohibit nuclear tests of greater than 150 kilotons.
   Robinson also said plans are far along for a historic joint
verification experiment to be conducted by the two sides in August
and September. The experiment, agreed to during the Washington
summit last December, calls for each side to measure a test
explosion of the other using on-site monitoring equipment.
   The U.S. test at the Nevada test site will take place in August,
and the Soviet test at Semipalatinsk about a month later, he said.
   During the hearing, committee members sparred with
administration officials over whether the administration has
abandoned a longstanding U.S. policy of seeking an eventual ban on
all nuclear testing.
   ``For 43 years we have experienced a need to test,'' said Maj.
Gen. William F. Burns, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency. ``I see nothing to change this need at the present.''
   Burns said the U.S. policy is that testing must continue so long
as the United States relies on nuclear weapons as a deterrent, a
position which drew fire from Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   Administrations from Eisenhower through Carter have held that
the United States would agree to a comprehensive test ban if the
Soviet Union would accept on-site inspection, Leach said, something
the Soviets have now done.
   ``For the first time in the history of arms control, the United
States is ceding the high ground to the Soviet Union,'' he said.
``I am appalled that we are not pursuing the big apple ... This
administration has backed off.''
   Burns responded: ``I am not particularly persuaded (by the fact)
that the comprehensive test ban has been part of the rhetoric of
the past six administrations, simply because times change. My
primary concern is the security of the United States.''

   Assuming there are no congressional objections, Brazil will be
offered eight of the weapons for an estimated $63 million. Brazil
wants to install the guns on four frigates and four corvettes, the
Pentagon said.
   The Phalanx, also known as the Close-In Weapon System, is a
computer-controlled gatling gun that fires depleted uranium
ammunition to knock down low-flying missiles or aircraft.
   The Navy would be responsible for overseeing the transaction
with Brazil and General Dynamics Corp. would be the prime
contractor.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday proposed a
redistribution of power in the Soviet Union to give new authority
to the president and legislature. But he ruled out a multiparty
system and indicated the Communist Party would retain control of
local government.
   In a 3{-hour speech opening the first Communist Party conference
in 47 years, Gorbachev sketched a vision of a nation strikingly
different from the authoritarian state built by Josef Stalin. He
called for a country that would be ruled by law and guarantee
individual rights.
   ``The Soviet people want a clear perspective,'' Gorbachev
concluded. ``They want full-blooded and unconditional democracy.
They want a rule of law without reservations.''
   Within hours of Gorbachev's speech, police in downtown Moscow
arrested two groups of demonstrators trying to demonstrate for
ethnic rights and the need for a multiparty system.
   Although Gorbachev made his most specific proposals in the
political and legal field, he also pressed for economic reform,
particularly in agriculture, to feed the nation's 284 million
people.
   The extraordinary conference will provide an arena for Gorbachev
and his opponents to debate his plans for `perestroika,'' the
restructuring of the vast country's economic system, and the reform
of the political system.
   Saying ``it is impossible today to describe in detail the
concrete image of the future,'' Gorbachev proposed:
   _ To create a new 2,250-member Congress of Deputies that would
elect a president and a 400- to 450-member, full-time legislature.
   _ To empower the president to oversee foreign and defense policy
and appoint the head of government.
   _ To hand executive power to the government and local councils,
known as soviets, and have local Communist Party chiefs elected to
head their soviets.
   The Soviet president now acts as a figurehead and the Soviet
Parliament merely approves decisions of the party.
   Gorbachev did not make clear what relationship the new president
would have to his own position _ that of party general secretary,
which currently is the most powerful post in the nation.
   While seeking to curb Communist Party power by law and promote a
division of authority, Gorbachev made clear he had no intention of
permitting rival parties to challenge Communist rule.
   He also condemned efforts to redraw the boundaries of the
nation's 15 republics, signaling he won't give in to Armenia's
demand to annex a mountain enclave belonging to a neighboring
republic.
   On agriculture, Gorbachev suggested expanding an experimental
system permitting farmers to lease their land from state and
collective farms into a nationwide program designed to give a quick
boost to food production.
   He said farmers should become the ``true masters'' of their land.
   Addressing the more sensitive point of price reform, which
necessarily would mean higher prices, the Soviet leader insisted,
``it is absolutely necessary to resolve this problem, no matter how
difficult it may be.''
   Gorbachev said overhauling the state price structure could ease
food shortages and improve the availability of high-quality
consumer goods.
   Meat and milk are rationed in several regions of the Soviet
Union, while state subsidies keep prices low.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, asked at a news
conference when ration cards would be abolished, refused to set a
date but said food supplies must be increased as soon as possible.
   ``It is a political issue, a moral issue, a social issue,'' said
the propaganda chief who is regarded as one of Gorbachev's key
advisers.
   Yakovlev declined to fix a date for price reform, saying that
five models are being studied, but ``the subject is so vast it
resists embracing.''
   Yakovlev was closely questioned about Gorbachev's plans for
political and legal reform and the extent to which they could take
power from the Communist party, but he offered few details.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said party and state functions will be
more clearly defined later. He suggested they would not be
separated from the party when he proposed that local soviets be
headed by local Communist Party chiefs.
   Economist Leonid Abalkin, a leading proponent of reform, won
applause when he criticized the proposal during debate at the
conference. Abalkin said it was undemocratic, since it appeared the
party chief would be the sole nominee to head the soviet.
   Neither Gorbachev nor Yakovlev made clear whether the principle
of electing the Communist Party chief as head of the soviet would
apply to the national political scene, where Gorbachev, as party
general secretary, now holds supreme power.
   Of the 5,000 delegates elected to the conference, 4,991
registered to take part in the Kremlin proceedings, Gorbachev said.
They listened in silence through most of his speech, applauding
only occasionally.
   After Gorbachev's address, which was broadcast live on TV and
radio, the delegates broke for lunch, then gathered behind closed
doors to discuss Gorbachev's proposals, which Yakovlev said were
approved by the ruling party Politburo eight days ago.
   State-run radio and TV later broadcast excerpts of the debate.
Radio Moscow said more than 100 delegates had asked for the floor
at the conference, due to last at least through Friday.
   In the economic section of his speech, Gorbachev attacked
conservative bureaucrats he said had blocked reforms and even
blamed the Central Committee apparatus for failing to head off
maneuvers to slow his changes.
   On human rights, Gorbachev called for an end to ``administrative
pressure'' on religious believers to espouse the official creed of
atheism, and for much stronger legal guarantees of privacy in the
home, in the postal system and telephone calls.
   ``The law must reliably protect a human's dignity,'' he said.
   Gorbachev condemned, however, any attempt to set up an
alternative political party or to exploit the new openness of
Soviet society for what he called ``non-creative goals.''
   Hours after Gorbachev spoke, promising freer expression and more
attention to nationality problems, about 200 Crimean Tartars tried
to stage a demonstration in Moscow. Police took them away in buses
seconds after they unfurled banners demanding a return to the
homeland from which they were deported by Stalin in the 1940s.
   Nearby, police also detained members of a citizens' group called
the Democratic Union, which advocates a multiparty political system.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has had testy relations
with his Republican counterpart in neighboring New Hampshire, John
Sununu, took a light-hearted jab at Sununu while addressing a
housing conference Tuesday.
   Dukakis, whose opposition to the Seabrook nuclear power plant
just north of the Massachusetts border has prevented the New
Hampshire plant from going on line, told the gathering that if
elected president he would adopt a housing policy that involved the
nation's 50 governors, ``including the guy from New Hampshire.''
   He then joked that the troubled Seabrook plant, which Sununu
fervently supports, could be converted into housing.
   ``I figured we'd hang balconies off it and make it
condominiums,'' the likely Democratic presidential nominee said.
   But even if elected president Dukakis won't get an opportunity
to work with Sununu on national housing policy.
   Sununu, a top figure in the presidential campaign of Vice
President George Bush and one of the Bush campaign's top critics of
Dukakis, has announced he will not seek another term as governor
and will leave office after his current term expires in January.

<HEAD>Farm Leader Says Surpluses Vital In Drought</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If there's a good side to the drought it could
be that Americans are being given a quick, hard lesson about the
importance of maintaining adequate food supplies, a national farm
leader said Tuesday.
   DeVon Woodland, president of the National Farmers Organization,
said that the surpluses once referred to as ``an albatross over
agriculture'' are now looked at as being extremely vital.
   ``I think we must always maintain a strategic food reserve in
this country and treat it as such,'' Woodland said. ``I think that
message is probably coming through loud and clear in the last few
months.''
   He added: ``The consumer, I think, is understanding today as
never before how vital this (agricultural) industry is.''
   Woodland and Leland H. Swenson, president of the National
Farmers Union, briefed reporters about a new study of U.S.
agriculture's economic structure by two Oklahoma State University
economists, Daryll E. Ray and James S. Plaxico.
   The study was commissioned by the NFO and the NFU. Although not
making specific recommendations, the study said the 1985 farm law's
basic philosophy of lowering federal price supports and payments to
farmers has not worked as proponents have contended. The law will
expire in 1990.
   It was argued that the 1985 law would result in U.S. recapture
of large shares of the farm export market, thus draining away
surpluses and eventually resulting in higher commodity prices and
improved farm income.
   ``However, our competitors have matched our price reductions and
have reduced their total acreage from zero to inconsequential,''
the economists reported.
   Moreover, they said, there is little future in ``using U.S. farm
policy to bludgeon our competitors into surrendering their export
business as a means of shoring up our export volume.''
   Woodland said foreign countries ``simply are not going to allow
themselves to become dependent on other countries for their
stability in the food supply. And we must take a similar posture
for protecting our industry, agriculture, and treat it as a vital
industry.''
   The two farm leaders, whose organizations in the past have
strongly urged some type of ``supply management'' of farm
production _ as opposed to the so-called market-oriented policies
favored by the Reagan administration _ said the report would be
widely distributed to members of Congress and candidates running
for office this fall.
   Asked which of the two apparent presidential nominees _ Michael
Dukakis and George Bush _ fit the policy ideals sought by NFU and
NFO, the farm leaders declined to be pinned down.
   ``I think we will make that decision through debate and through
discussion, and, hopefully, members will be involved in the
political process,'' Swenson said. ``Our organization, the National
Farmers Union, does not endorse political candidates, and any
reference of that type would be an indication ... and I do not
choose to get into that.''

<TEXT>
   Two Turks seeking notoriety faked a plot
to kill Pope John Paul II on the first day of his visit to Austria,
authorities said Tuesday.
   They said the 68-year-old pontiff was not in danger during his
five-day tour of this Alpine nation, which ended Monday. John Paul
has survived two assassination attempts in his decade as leader of
the world's Roman Catholics.
   Interior Minister Karl Blecha said the escape of 29 terrorist
inmates from a Turkish prison in March put Austria on alert because
of the possibility some might head for this country. He said
Interpol, the international police agency, advised Austrian
officials of the escape.
   Mehmet Ali Agca, now serving life in prison, shot and seriously
wounded the pope in May 1981 in St. Peter's Square in Rome. Agca
belonged to a right-wing Turkish terrorist group called the Gray
Wolves.
   One year after Agca's attempt, a man lunged at the pope with a
knife during a visit to Portugal, but John Paul was not hurt.
   The Austrian incident gained attention after an American
television network reported Monday that a plot to assassinate John
Paul had been discovered and foiled. International news media
carried the report for more than 10 hours before Austria responded
officially.
   Blecha told reporters at midday Tuesday, after a Cabinet
meeting: ``The two men staged the so-called assassination plot as a
means of gaining attention. ``No weapons were found, only a warning
pistol unable to shoot bullets. They were arrested and charged with
faking a criminal act, but were not kept in jail.''
   Austrian television said of the Turks: ``At first they were
prime suspects in a possible plot.''
   Officials said the men, whose names were not released, were
arrested two days before John Paul's arrival and had been freed by
the time the pontiff arrived last Thursday. The men face maximum
punishment of six months in jail or a fine.
   ``They are now free, in Austria,'' Blecha said. ``This
investigation is closed. We investigated, and we determined that
these two men were not members of the Gray Wolves. During the papal
visit, there was no attempted assassination.''
   He said the hoax resulted from the men ``craving attention'' but
offered no further explanation of their motives.
   The interior minister, who oversees many police and security
functions, said the plot was intended ``to grab the attention of
the world news media.''
   Interior Ministry spokesman Karl Newole said Tuesday afternoon:
``It was an attempt to become world-famous. The risk was small
because even the potential maximum penalty for faking such a plot
is small.''
   Authorities said one of the men told police on June 13 that the
other planned to assassinate John Paul outside St. Stephen's
Cathedral, where the pope said Mass. The man showed pictures of a
building under construction, from which he said the shots would be
fired.
   Investigation showed the men to be accomplices in a hoax, the
officials said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a rare public criticism
of Soviet foreign policy Tuesday, saying a ``narrow circle'' of
Kremlin leaders once made decisions without weighing the outcome
for the people or consulting with allies.
   Gorbachev made the remarks during a televised Kremlin speech
attended by, among others, President Andrei A. Gromyko, who served
as foreign minister for nearly three decades under Gorbachev's
predecessors. State-run television did not show Gromyko's reaction
to the remarks.
   Gorbachev, opening a nationwide Communist Party conference,
appeared to target the reign of President Leonid I. Brezhnev in his
criticism of past Soviet diplomatic moves, although he offered no
specifics.
   ``One cannot but admit that the command and administrative
methods did not bypass the foreign policy sphere,'' Gorbachev said,
referring to the bureaucracy, one of his favorite targets.
   Under Brezhnev, Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces entered
Czechoslovakia in 1968 to put down that country's reform-minded
leadership. And the Kremlin sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan
in 1979, only to see them bog down in a protracted war with Moslem
guerrillas.
   ``It happened that even the most important decisions were
adopted by a narrow circle of persons, without a collective and
all-around study and analysis, and sometimes also without a proper
consultation with friends,'' Gorbachev said. ``This resulted in an
inadequate reaction to international events and the policy of other
states and sometimes in mistaken decisions.''
   ``Unfortunately,'' he added, ``the price for the people or the
possible outcome of some variant of action was not always weighed.''

   Heavy rains and flash floods in
Bangladesh in the past week have killed at least 27 people and
damaged homes, crops, roads and communications, officials and news
reports said Tuesday.
   Five people died Tuesday in flood-related accidents in this town
92 miles northeast of Dhaka, officials reported.
   Five other deaths were reported in southern Bangladesh. Earlier
in the week, 17 people died nationwide.
   Muzaffar Ali, his wife and five children were among the 500
people evacuated from Noapara, a hilly town east of Sylhet, to a
relief camp after flood waters damaged their house.
   ``I am leaving the camp since water is no more there,'' said
Ali, who is returning home after the floodwaters have receeded.
   But government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the situation in other parts of the Sylhet district was
worsening because river waters were rushing in from the Indian
state of Assam.
   About 1.3 million people are reported stranded in the district,
they said.
   In neighbouring Sunamganj district, the flooding has trapped
800,000 people on the rooftops of their submerged homes, press
reports said Tuesday.
   Abdur Rahim, a businessman who reached Dhaka on Tuesday from
Sunamganj, said he saw thousands of people waiting on top of houses
to be rescued.
   A Railway Ministry official, who asked not to be identified,
said train services between Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong
have been disrupted since Sunday because of incessant rains. He
said service on the Dhaka-Sylhet rail line was also stopped because
the floods damaged two bridges.
   The government said at least 25 people were killed in floods and
rain last month, but unofficial reports claim at least 50 people
have died.
   Hundreds of rivers run through Bangladesh, an impoverished
nation of 105 million people, and flooding is common between June
and September.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Tuesday
moved to fill two key slots in the Justice Department, recommending
that Douglas Kmiec be nominated to head the office of legal counsel
and that Thomas Boyd become chief of the office of legislative
affairs.
   Kmiec, currently a deputy in the legal counsel's office, would
replace Charles Cooper, who announced May 27 that he was resigning
effective July 8 to enter private law practice. Cooper said several
days ago he is still in the process of deciding what firm to join.
   Kmiec, 36, will become acting assistant attorney general in
charge of legal counsel's office when Cooper leaves, the Justice
Department said in a statement.
   Boyd, 41, has been the acting assistant attorney general in
charge of the legislative affairs office since the departure in
March of John Bolton, who is now the assistant attorney general for
the civil division. Boyd served as associate counsel to the House
Judiciary Committee from 1976 to 1986.
   Kmiec, currently on leave as a professor of law at the
University of Notre Dame, was a White House Fellow and special
assistant to the secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1982
and 1983.
   The department has been hit by a series of departures in recent
months. Former Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal
division chief William Weld resigned March 29 to protest Meese's
continued tenure at the Justice Department in the face of an
ongoing criminal investigation of Meese.
   Burns has been replaced by acting deputy Harold Christensen,
while Weld has been replaced by Ed Dennis. Both men are serving in
an acting capacity pending completion of the Senate confirmation
process.

   A court in Stuttgart found Eva Haule-Frimpong, 33, guilty of the
1984 attempted bombing of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
training school in the southern state of Bavaria and sentenced her
to 15 years in prison.
   An accomplice, Christian Kluth, 29, was sentenced to 10 years in
prison after being convicted of planting a bomb that exploded
outside the offices of the Dornier aeronautics company in southern
West Germany in 1986.
   Luitgard Horstein, 25, who was arrested with the other two in

convicted of belonging to the Red Army Faction, West Germany's most
notorious leftist terrorist group.

   Thousands of employees called off a

industries when the government said it would not take
across-the-board action.
   The employees agreed to reconsider their protest against the
government's plans to privatize 19 state enterprises, including
water supply, mass transit and electricity concerns.
   Union leaders, representing about 400,000 members, demanded that
at least some of the industries not be sold. In addition, they want
the reinstatement of laid-off employees, heavy fines for employers
violating labor laws and a restructuring of the social security
system.
   ``There will be no such across-the-board privatization of the
state enterprises,'' said government spokesman Mechai Viravaidya.
   About 100 policemen stood by as thousands of workers, supported
by labor unions, rallied in front of Government House, the seat of

<TEXT>
   As many as 40 political prisoners may
be freed this week as part of government efforts to improve
relations with the opposition, news reports said Tuesday.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap and several leading newspapers
said the prisoners were expected to be released Thursday from a
number of prisons around the country.
   The Justice Ministry declined to comment on the reports, but
said an announcement on the matter might be made Wednesday.
   South Korea's two main opposition parties have been demanding
the release of all political prisoners. President Roh Tae-woo's
government, after recent talks, agreed to consider the matter.
   Opposition leaders contend there are more than 1,000 political
prisoners serving sentences or awaiting trial for anti-government
activity. Government officials say most of the prisoners were
sentenced for violent crimes or violating national security laws.
   Hundreds of political prisoners have been released since the
government of former President Chun Doo-hwan bowed to demands for
democratic reforms after nationwide unrest.
   Roh, who won presidential elections in December over divided
opposition candidates, promised to consider further releases as
part of his commitment to introduce full democracy after years of
authoritarian rule.

<HEAD>Defendants In Spanish Toxic Oil Trial Await Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The longest trial in Spanish history
adjourned Tuesday amid angry outbursts against 38 defendants
awaiting a verdict on charges they sold toxic rapeseed oil that
killed 621 people.
   The three-judge panel that presided over the 15-month trial _
dubbed Spain's ``trial of the century'' by the press _ was expected
to deliberate for at least three months before reaching a verdict
on the charges, which include involuntary manslaughter and health
fraud.
   About 25,000 people told health authorities they fell ill after
buying what was sold in 1981 as cheap olive oil imported from
France, mostly in poor neighborhoods around Madrid.
   Defense attorneys argued the prosecution had failed to show the
adulterated rapeseed oil caused the deaths and injuries.
   Prosecutor Eduardo Fungairino accused eight of the defendants of
manslaughter and demanded they be given sentences totaling 85,088
years in prison.
   He also sought 25,952 years in jail for the other 30 defendants
charged with a variety of fraud and public health crimes as well as
indemnities of $120,000 for the families of each of the dead
victims.
   As the defendants were whisked away on a bus, some women cried,
three others fainted, while several began screaming, ``Murderer!''
   In his final argument, Fungairino called the sale of the
rapeseed oil ``alimentary terrorism'' and demanded ``exemplary
punishment.''
   The maximum prison term under Spanish law is 30 years.
   More than 1,500 witnesses and 200 experts have testified since
the trail opened March 30, 1987, in the 680-seat courtroom built on
the outskirts of Madrid especially for this case.
   ``I've come every day,'' said 72-year-old Cayetano Bermejo, who
was at the final session of the trial. He added that both he and
his wife suffered bladder, liver and heart ailments since consuming
the oil in 1981.
   ``I want them to do me justice and fix my life, which they took
away from me,'' he said.
   ``I want them to cure me, but if they don't, they should at
least punish the murderers,'' said Concha Rodriguez, another woman
who said she became ill after buying the oil in an open-air market
in Madrid.
   ``My brother! My brother! My brother!'' another woman wailed
over and over.

<HEAD>Nazi-Hunters Stumble On New List of British-Resident Suspects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nazi hunters on Tuesday handed the British
government a list of 13 alleged war criminals who fled to Britain,
saying it was new evidence the country harbored Nazi collaborators
to assist with anti-Soviet intelligence.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center
submitted the list of White Russians, now aged 63 to 89, to a
two-man legal panel appointed by the government. The list showed
all but three were policemen.
   The Home Office said it will try to trace the men on the list,
which brings to 31 the number of suspects submitted to the panel by
the Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal Center.
   The panel also has received from other sources the names of 84
other suspected Nazi collaborators, of which 18 have been traced to
British addresses.
   Hier said researchers stumbled on the new list last week while
sifting through British government records for traces of members of
Adolf Hitler's notorious SS who escaped to Canada via Britain after
World War II.
   Hier said some of the suspects' addresses in British prisoner of
war camps were first submitted by the Soviet ambassador in November
1947.
   The Soviet sheet of charges showed most of the 13 were accused
of taking part in mass murders and deportations in Nazi-occupied
Soviet territory in 1941 and 1942.
   But the researchers found a December 1947 reply from Ernest
Bevin, the foreign secretary in Britain's first post-war
government, telling the Soviet ambassador that none of the men
could be traced despite an ``exhaustive search.''
   ``This is incredible,'' said Hier, in London to hand over the
evidence.
   ``The Soviet Embassy provided specific details of what each and
every one of these men had done and where they were, down to post
box and street numbers, and the British _ in their own country _
couldn't find them,'' Hier said in an interview.
   Hier gave a photocopy of the list to The Associated Press with
the names blanked out. The center's usual policy is to release
names only to government investigators.
   The Wiesenthal Center, which has long accused Britain of
foot-dragging over fugitive Nazis and their collaborators, also
produced a 1983 letter from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government saying Britain has not felt obliged to deport suspected
war criminals since 1950.
   ``Now we know why inquiries made about Nazi war criminals from
the beginning were left hanging,'' said Hier. ``It was the Cold War
and they were interested in (countering) communism. They wanted to
play ball with the Nazi criminals.''
   A Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the
letter, dated Dec. 21, 1983, from a foreign office minister,
Baroness Young, to a rank-and-file lawmaker, Patrick Ground.
   Ground had inquired about a native Estonian whose extradition
the Soviets sought in 1960, saying he perpetrated atrocities
against Jews and anti-German partisans as head of the Nazi-run
secret police in Estonia which now is now part of the Soviet Union.
   Baroness Young acknowledged the Estonian had lived in Britain
since 1947 and that Britain had refused to extradite him. He was
sentenced to death in his absence by a Soviet court in March 1961.
   Baroness Young added that in December 1950, Britain told the
United Nations War Crimes Commission ``we considered we had
discharged our obligations with regard to the surrender of alleged
war criminals. ... We no longer regarded ourselves under an
obligation to deport such persons.''
   A Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the 1947
exchanges.
   ``I think it's a case that whatever Mr. Bevin said at the time
speaks for itself,'' said the spokesman, who in accordance with
British practice declined to be identified.
   The two-member British panel appointed by the British government
in February consists of Sir Thomas Heatherington, a former British
director of prosecutions, and William Chambers, a former Crown
agent (a senior government official) in Scotland.
   The inquiry, expected to last about a year, will recommend
whether Britain should pass laws to allow prosecutions in Britain
for crimes committed in another country.
   The most publicized British case submitted to the panel is that
of Lithuanian-born Antanas Gecas, whom the Wisenthal Center and the
Soviet authorities say was involved in the murders of thousands of
Jews. Gecas, who lives in Edinburgh, denies the allegations but
acknowledges he witnessed killings.
   The Wiesenthal center has identified 400 suspected war criminals
in eight Western countries, including the United States, Canada,
Australia and West Germany.

   An incident at an Illinois nuclear plant that
could have jeopardized safety has prompted a nationwide alert
affecting 37 reactors, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
Tuesday.
   In the event March 9 at the LaSalle plant owned by Commonwealth
Edison Co. at Ottawa, Ill., two pumps that circulate water through
a reactor were shut off when the plant was operating at about 85
percent of full power, the NRC said.
   The incident produced an uncontrolled power fluctuation in which
power increased to 118 pecent of the reactor's rated capacity
before the system automatically shut down, the commission said.
   ``Since this kind of event had not occurred previously in a
licensed power reactor in this country, though it had been
calculated that it could occur, the generic safety implications
were not readily apparent,'' the NRC said.
   Although Commonwealth Edison was not at fault and handled the
situation properly, the problem could have been serious, NRC
spokesman Frank Ingram said.
   He originally speculated that, unchecked, the incident could
have resulted in a meltdown. However, an engineer on the commission
staff said the risk was not so great.
   ``We didn't know how much worse the situation could get, and
there was the potential _ not likely, but the potential _ of fuel
damage,'' said Ashok Thadani, the NRC's assistant director of
engineering and systems technology. ``But a whole lot of other
things have to go wrong before you worry about a (radiation)
release.''
   Edison spokeswoman Deborah Vestal dismissed either scenario as
speculation.
   ``Obviously, you want to look at all your possibilities,'' she
said. ``But there's always the possibility that nothing would have
happened. It could have subsided by itself.''
   She said both pumps inadvertently were shut down at the same
time during routine calibration of instruments and the mixture of
cold and hot water in the reactor system when the pumps started
again caused the power fluctuation.
   ``At the instant, we knew what was occurring and we knew what to
do to cease it. That's what was done,'' Ms. Vestal said. ``There
was no damage to the fuel. There was no release of radiation. There
was no suffering at the plant.''
   Ingram called the incident a fluke occurrence that could happen
without warning at any of the 37 U.S. reactors using boiling water
_ some use pressurized water _ to turn their turbines.
   He said the NRC has notified other plants using boiling-water
reactors about the LaSalle incident and asked them to make sure
their operators are briefed so they can recognize the conditions
leading up to uncontrolled power changes and know how to handle
them.

   Frightened relatives of four people slain in what
authorities say may be a polygamist sect dispute were being guarded
by police Tuesday to thwart the possibility of further bloodshed.
   Police were hunting for the killers of an 8-year-old girl and
three one-time followers of the late polygamist patriarch Ervil
LeBaron. Three people were shot at point-blank range Monday in
Houston and one was ambushed in the Dallas suburb of Irving.
   ``We're looking at the strong possibility that someone of that
cult may have done the killing,'' Houston police spokesman Al Baker
said Tuesday.
   Duane Chynoweth, 31, and his daughter, Jennifer, were slain
about 4 p.m. Monday in a pickup truck parked outside a vacant house
in Houston. Chynoweth was shot several times in the head while the
girl was shot once in the face, said police spokesman Dan Turner.
   Chynoweth apparently was delivering an appliance to the house.
Police were trying to determine who arranged for the delivery.
   About the same time, Chynoweth's brother, Mark, 36, was found
shot to death at an appliance business a few miles away, Turner
said. Mark Chynoweth was LeBaron's son-in-law.
   In Irving, Eddie Marston, 32, one of LeBaron's stepsons, also
was found shot to death shortly after 4 p.m.
   Family members in Houston, under heavy police guard, were
brought to police headquarters late Monday for questioning.
   ``We're making some arrangements with family members to ensure
that they are safe,'' Baker said, adding that he did not know how
many people were involved. He said the family was cooperating fully
with the investigation. No arrests had been made.
   A witness to the slayings of Duane and Jennifer Chynoweth told
police that shortly after Chynoweth arrived at the house, two men
in a late-model black or dark-colored pickup truck drove up and got
out. There was a short exchange of words and then a flurry of
gunfire, the witness said.
   LeBaron's Church of the Lamb of God split into several groups
after he died in prison in 1981. Polygamist sects broke off from
the Mormon Church when it outlawed multiple marriages in 1890.
   Turner said Duane Chynoweth was a polygamist, but he had no
information about Mark Chynoweth.
   LeBaron died of a heart attack while serving a sentence in Utah
for the 1977 murder of rival polygamist leader Rulin Allred.
   Marston and Mark Chynoweth were acquitted in Allred's slaying.
Marston also was acquitted in the 1975 slaying of another
polygamist leader.
   Lillian Chynoweth told The Salt Lake City Tribune last October
she was worried LeBaron left a ``Book of New Covenants,'' written
while in prison, which his sons are using as a blueprint for
vengeance.
   She said the writings included a ``list of people my father
thought needed to be killed.''
   She said she and her husband were on the list and asked that her
whereabouts not be revealed.

   The past week's triple-digit temperatures
blotted up soil moisture and severely stressed crops throughout
most of the eastern half of the nation, the government's Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``Corn, cotton, soybeans, sorghum and spring wheat conditions
continued declining'' during the week of June 20-26, the facility
said. ``The lack of moisture may prevent some recently planted
soybeans and sorghum from emerging.''
   Pastures were rated poor to very poor, the report said. Farmers
culled herds as pasture and hay supplies declined.
   Meanwhile, the National Farmers Union and Feed the Children
scheduled a news conference for Wednesday to announce plans for
distributing hay to stricken livestock farmers, beginning next week
in South Dakota. The initial shipment, involving 15 rail cars, will
include hay from Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi, she said.
   The Agriculture Department said federal and state officials have
agreed to establish a national hay information network, or HayNet,
to help locate available hay and identify drought-stricken areas
that need forage badly.
   A number of state hay hotlines are already in operation, said
LaVerne Ausman, deputy undersecretary for small community and rural
development. The USDA and the National Association of State
Departments of Agriculture will broaden these efforts.
   ``Each week, participating states will tell USDA how much hay
they have on hand and can spare, or how much they need,'' Ausman
said. ``This information will be put into a national data bank,
available to each state by electronic mail.''
   Ausman said individual farmers who have a supply of hay or who
need hay should contact their state department of agriculture.
   States with hotlines to date and the numbers were reported by
USDA as:
   Illinois, 1-800-541-9561.
   Iowa, 1-800-383-5079.
   Kansas, 1-800-228-5724.
   Kentucky, for in-state dialing only, 502-564-4696.
   Minnesota, 1-800-652-9747.
   Missouri, 1-800-877-4HAY.
   Ohio, 1-800-686-7246.
   South Carolina, for in-state dialing only, 803-734-2210.
   South Dakota, 1-800-228-5254.
   Wisconsin, 1-800-362-3020.
   Ausman said Indiana has targeted July 1 to start its hotline.

<HEAD>Turkish President Seeks Military Aid, Complains of Armenian
Resolutions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Turkish President Kenan Evren said Tuesday his
country needs more military aid and he complained that proposed
congressional resolutions on the killing of Armenians in Turkey
``distort history and encourage terrorism.''
   ``The risks shouldered by Turkey are much beyond her fair
share,'' Evren said in a National Press Club address, adding that
American awareness of Turkey ``falls short of what would reasonably
be expected regarding an ally of 40 years.''
   ``Situated in one of the most critical regions of the world,
Turkey shares the longest border with the Soviet Union, guards the
strategic Turkish straits and maintains the largest NATO army after
the U.S.,'' he said.
   Even though Turkey has the lowest income of the NATO countries,
its defense spending puts it among the top four nations in the
16-member alliance, Evren said.
   He also appealed for the removal of U.S. trade barriers to
Turkish exports of textiles, apparel and steel.
   Evren said he preferred ``less aid, more trade'' as a way of
enabling Turkey to obtain more income to pay for its military
modernization.
   He spoke in Turkish; his speech and answers to subsequent
questions were translated simultaneously by an interpreter.
   Evren's references were as specific as he has been in public
during his state visit about Turkish complaints over cutbacks in
U.S. aid. He didn't broach the subject during formal speeches at
the White House on Monday, when he met with President Reagan.
   In exchange for the use of Turkish bases, U.S. officials have
pledged to the Turkish goverment to make their ``best effort'' to
persuade Congress to provide sufficient aid to help the Turkish
military to modernize its forces.
   But Congress, at the urging of the Greek-American lobby, has
consistently trimmed the request to keep it in line with aid to
rival ally Greece.
   In recent years the administration sought about $800 million
annually in military aid, but Congress reduced that to about $600
million.
   This year Turkey said it needed $1.2 billion in U.S. military
aid, but because of budget constraints the Reagan administration
sought only $570 million, and Congress cut that to $520 million.
   Evren canceled plans for a state visit to the United States last
year in large part because of Turkish anger over the aid cuts. He
also was displeased by a proposed congressional resolution
condemning the alleged massacre of up to 2.5 million Armenians in
Turkish territory during World War II.
   ``The Turkish people are most sensitive to efforts to promote
passage by your Congress of resolutions that distort history and
encourage terrorism,'' Evren said in a National Press Club address.
   The resolutions, he said, encouraged Armenian terrorists, who
have killed 40 Turkish diplomats and injured about 400 people. He
added that Armenians, however, have rejected terrorism in ``the
past couple of years.''
   Evren disputed Armenian charges of genocide and said Armenians,
incited by the Russian army, had first massacred Turkish people.

<HEAD>Fireworks Maker Wins Belated Battle For UPS Shipping Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fireworks manufacturer has won its
case with the Interstate Commerce Commission to force United Parcel
Service to deliver Class C fireworks to customers in other states.
   The ICC board voted 3-2 on Monday to strike down a UPS policy
that permitted it to refuse to ship fireworks on grounds that too
many states have conflicting regulations on fireworks shipment.
   The ICC order reverses an earlier decision to uphold the
delivery service policy in late 1987.
   Bob Kenney, a UPS spokesman, said it was too early to comment.
   Richard Streeter, a lawyer for B.J. Alan of Youngstown and 24
other fireworks companies in the case, said the ruling would force
UPS to resume delivery to out-of-state customers because the
service is a ``common carrier'' holding a virtual monopoly on
inexpensive parcel delivery to homes.
   ``When they (UPS) pulled the plug, there was no reasonable
alternative for the fireworks companies. Federal Express was the
only thing that saved the companies, but they were just too
expensive for most customers.''
   He said Federal Express would charge about $25 for a parcel of
fireworks that could be delivered for $5 or $6 by UPS.
   He said the shipping ban extended only to fireworks and none of
the other 34 categories of Class C explosives, including ammunition
and explosive rivets.
   Bruce J. Zoldan, president of B.J. Alan, said the policy cost
the company an estimated 40 percent of its mail-order sales and
forced the layoff of about 100 seasonal workers. He said mail-order
sales account for about one fourth of the company's business.

<HEAD>Montana Wildfire Nearly Contained; Calif. Blaze Destroys 4 Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A fast-moving range fire destroyed four homes in California on
Tuesday, while firefighters on the Montana-South Dakota border
worked to contain a timber and grass fire that has consumed 58,300
acres.
   About 1,000 firefighters made headway against the fire Ekalaka,
Mont., which was considered 95 percent contained, fire information
officer Judy Schutza said.
   ``They're looking really good right now,'' Ms. Schutza said.
``We're looking for containment tonight.''
   By late Monday night, firefighters were mopping up and checking
for hot spots on the perimeter of the blaze, which burned a large
section of the Custer National Forest.
   Winds that had been fanning the blaze dropped Monday and changed
direction, she said. Thundershowers Monday night helped.
   ``The fire lines held,'' she said. ``The rain didn't amount to a
whole lot, but it made us feel better.''
   No new fires were reported Tuesday from the lightning, she said,
but equipment was on standby.
   Temperatures were expected to be in the mid-90s Tuesday, down
from highs in the high 90s to above 100 in recent days. Winds
slowed to 15-25 mph from as high as 45 mph.
   In Northern California, a fire started about 4 a.m., burning 100
acres one mile outside Cloverdale and about 70 miles north of San
Francisco.
   The blaze, whipped by winds up to 20 mph, was nearly contained
by mid-morning, said Marie Mappus, spokeswoman for the forestry
department.
   One firefighter sustained minor injuries but no one was was
hurt, she said.

<HEAD>Director Calls Registration Program a Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Selective Service System entered its
ninth year of peacetime registration of draft-eligible young men
Tuesday with a roll call of 13.7 million and a compliance rate of
97 percent, its director said.
   Samuel K. Lessey, attending a training conference Tuesday in
Orlando, said the federal agency was proud of its success in the
eight years since Congress re-instituted registration for ``every
male citizen ... between the ages of 18 and 26.''
   Peacetime registration ``ensures that untrained manpower can be
delivered to the armed forces quickly in a time of national
emergency,'' Lessey told a news conference. It also ensures ``a
fair and equitable system to establish a priority of call,'' he
said.
   Lessey said Florida and 15 other states were helping the
compliance rate by passing legislation denying student financial
aid to those who do not sign up. The 1988 Florida Legislature also
passed a bill requiring registration for anyone seeking state
employment, or promotion if already employed.
   Procrastination, lack of information and ignorance are the main
reasons for failing to register, Lessey said, adding, ``We don't
notice any particular opposition to registration.''
   Youths failing to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday
face a felony charge punishable by five years in prison and a fine
of $250,000.
   ``Our biggest task is to assure that the 5,000 men who turn 18
every day are aware of the registration requirement,'' Lessey said.

   A Florida neurologist was reunited with her
Soviet Lithuanian husband Tuesday when he arrived in the United
States following a 10-year fight to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
   ``Today is the happiest day of my life,'' Dr. Galina Vileshina
of Boca Raton, Fla., declared after her husband, Pyatras Pakenas,
arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport.
   Pakenas had been among a group of Soviet refuseniks with whom
President Reagan met on May 30 during his summit visit to Moscow.
   Ms. Vileshina's efforts on behalf of her husband included
meetings with Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   She also enlisted the aid of members of Congress, human rights
activists, journalists and other ``divided couples.''
   Pakenas, 55, also was greeted at the airport by his daughter,
Laura Abovich, and 8-year-old grandson Eric, as well as Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, Jr., R-Fla.
   Ms. Vileshina expressed her thanks to Reagan, Shultz and other
officials and supporters who had helped her. ``Because of you all I
have my husband today,'' she said.
   Pakenas told reporters that ``all of the good things that are
happening in the Soviet Union are only happening because of the
meetings at the highest level between our governments. ... I want
to thank all of the American people who were very good and kind to
my wife and my family while I was back in the Soviet Union.''
   ``This is the climax of a beautiful, beautiful love story,''
Shaw said.
   Ms. Vileshina, 52, her daughter and son, Alex, were able to
leave the Soviet Union in 1980. Since then she had only been able
to see her husband during a 10-day visit to the Soviet Union last
year.
   Altogether Pakenas filed 18 emigration requests until he was
able to obtain an exit visa last month.
   Pakenas, who arrived on a from West Germany, had left the Soviet
Union late last week.

<HEAD>Sandinista High Command Meets As Truce Runs Out</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The high command is meeting with
hundreds of officers to analyze the military situation in Nicaragua
as a truce with U.S.-backed rebels runs out, the Defense Department
said Tuesday.
   The government-declared truce ends Thursday night, a day after
U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz is scheduled to arrive in
the region for a round of consultations with four Central American
presidents.
   The department called the meetings between Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega and his commanders ``extremely important.'' It said
such meetings are held only in extraordinary circumstances.
   It gave no details. Ortega is the brother of President Daniel
Ortega.
   The rebels, known as Contras, rejected the leftist Sandinista
government's offer for more peace talks, but offered to extend the
truce indefinitely.
   The government who said this week that 3,000 Contra fighters had
started filtering across the border from Honduras, has not said if
it will prolong the fragile truce.
   Both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement.
   Nicaragua has been at relative peace since March 23, when the
Contras and Sandinistas agreed to the first in a series of
cease-fires and peace talks.
   The talks fell apart on June 9 with the two sides unable to
agree on rebel disarmament and Sandinista democratic reforms.
   Since then, the Sandinistas proposed a formal round of talks in
Managua on a lasting peace or informal discussions on the
cease-fire in Miami. The Contras rejected both offers.
   The high-level military meetings came as President Ortega was on
his first official visit to Cuba.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada said Ortega's visit will
``deepen Latin America unity against the traditionally aggressive
policies of the United States.''
   In a clandestine broadcast monitored in Managua Tuesday, the
Contras' Radio Liberacion accused Ortega and Cuban President Fidel
Castro of holding ``secret talks about crushing'' Sandinista
opponents.
   The Nicaraguan opposition newspaper La Prensa called Ortega's
visit to Havana ``inopportune'' and said it might encourage the
United States to resume military aid to the Contras.
   Cuba gave Ortega its highest award Monday night, the Order of
Jose Marti.
   In his acceptance speech, Ortega said the Sandinistas ``will
never sacrifice our revolutionary democratic process, even if (the
United States) orders new terrorist actions against Nicaragua.''
   He said that while the Sandinistas intend to continue ``fighting
and confronting Yankee aggression energetically,'' they still want
to find a ``negotiated end to the conflict imposed on us by the
United States.''
   The United States has been funding the Contras since 1981, two
years after the Sandinistas took power. The war has killed more
than 26,000 people and has wrecked the Nicaraguan economy.
   Shultz is leaving Wednesday afternoon for Guatemala City. He
ends his Central American visit Friday, after consulting with
officials from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.

   President Reagan's top arms control advisers
debated but failed to reach agreement Tuesday on how to respond to
a Soviet radar installation they say violates the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, sources said.
   ``We don't know what approach we want to take,'' said one
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The administration has been complaining since 1983 that the
radar violates ABM treaty provisions that such devices be located
near the Soviet border and aim outward _ conditions designed to
prevent deployment of a nationwide ballistic missile defense.
   At the recent summit in Moscow, U.S. officials said that until
the issue was resolved they would not sign a proposed Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty to slash long-range nuclear arsenals by up to
50 percent.
   Soviet leaders repeated their claim that the radar was intended
to track objects in space. But last October, in apparent response
to U.S. complaints, they suspended construction of the incomplete
radar facility at Krasnoyarsk.
   Before the meeting on Tuesday, State Department officials,
including arms control negotiator Paul Nitze, advocated a formula
designed to leave the Soviets a graceful exit from the impasse: the
Russians would complete no further work on the radar and the
Americans would determine that it was not a ``significant
violation'' of the treaty, according to administration sources.
   Defense Department officials and some hardliners in the State
Department, including arms control adviser Edward Rowny, want
Reagan to declare the radar a ``material breach'' of the pact, and
to announce a tough response.
   Neither position prevailed at the session Tuesday, and the issue
will be considered at a future meeting or decided by the president,
sources said.
   A White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, said details of the
meeting would not be made public.
   Sometime before Oct. 2, the joint U.S.-Soviet Standing
Consultative Commission created under the ABM treaty, is due to
meet to review the pact, said William F. Burns, head of the U.S.
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   ``I believe the review process will deal primarily with the
issues as we see them, under the ABM treaty, and the primary issues
are those issues of Soviet violation, primarily the Krasnoyarsk
radar,'' Burns told an American Bar Association conference on arms
control verification issues.
   Other administration sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Burns met Tuesday with other arms control aides,
including presidential assistants Nitze, Rowny and Max Kampelman,
and Assistant Defense Secretary Ronald Lehman.
   Burns declined to discuss the issue in detail, saying, ``I
really can't say anything more about that right now.''
   Some administration officials want the U.S. government to
declare that the Soviets have violated the ABM pact and on that
basis conduct more extensive tests of sensors designed as part of
the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, sources said.
   Administration critics have argued that such tests would violate
the ABM pact, and Reagan so far has refrained from implementing a
so-called ``broad interpretation'' of the treaty, which would allow
more extensive testing.
   The Soviets have said they will not sign a strategic arms
reduction treaty unless the United States agrees to abide by the
ABM pact for another 10 years.
   For the past two years, Congress has barred the executive branch
from spending any money on SDI tests that would violate the
traditional, or narrow, interpretation of the ABM pact.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves Bill For Independent FAA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill
Tuesday making the Federal Aviation Administration an independent
agency, a change designed to make the government more responsive to
aviation industry problems.
   The measure, sponsored by Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of
the Senate aviation subcommittee, was sent to the full chamber by a
14-4 vote.
   Its chances of passage by the Senate appear strong because Ford
gathered 57 co-sponsors. But prospects of passage in the House seem
weaker because some leading members, including Rep. Norman Mineta,
D-Calif., chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, have
questioned the bill's premise.
   The legislation would pull the FAA out of the Department of
Transportation, where it has been since the department was created
in 1966. Ford has argued that the Transportation Department,
heeding the Reagan administration's efforts to cut federal
spending, has restrained the FAA from aggressively embarking on
various programs.
   In a prepared statement after the bill was approved, Ford said
the legislation ``would end a situation in which the FAA is being
strangled, in the name of politics, by the secretary of
transportation and the ever-meddling departmental staff.''
   Opponents have said the measure actually would weaken the FAA by
removing the Cabinet-level clout it now has as a part of the
Transportation Department.
   In addition, they have said an independent FAA would be too
sympathetic to aviation industry groups _ such as airlines and
small plane owners _ which would no longer have to contend with
Transportation Department officials. Industry officials have long
called for an independent FAA.
   The legislation would give the chief of the FAA a seven-year
term. The administrator currently serves at the pleasure of the
president.
   It would allow the FAA to increase by 10 percent or more the
salaries of its air traffic controllers and other employees who
work in sections of the country with high costs of living. The
agency has complained that it has difficulty finding workers
willing to transfer to those parts of the country.
   In addition, it would allow the agency to streamline its
procedures for purchasing equipment. FAA officials have said their
efforts to acquire modern equipment are slowed by federal
procurement rules.
   In a report completed in April, the president's Aviation Safety
Commission recommended that the FAA be removed from the
transportation department.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded two young Palestinians in the narrow streets of the Nablus
market Tuesday, and a general strike virtually closed Arab east
Jerusalem and the occupied lands.
   Army radio said a third Arab youth was shot during a
stone-throwing protest in the nearby Balata refugee camp, but an
army spokesman could not confirm the report.
   The army kept curfews on parts of eight cities and refugee camps
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Underground leaflets
called for a strike and protests on the 21st anniversary of
Israel's annexation of Arab east Jersualem, which Israel captured
in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank and Gaza.
   Soldiers used roadblocks in the West Bank to stop Palestinians
from entering Jerusalem. At one checkpoint on the road from
Bethlehem a large sign said in pink Arabic letters: ``It is
forbidden to go to Jerusalem.''
   Several members of the anti-Arab Kach movement opened fire in
the Arrub refugee camp near Hebron after residents stoned a passing
Israeli bus, the domestic news agency Itim said. It quoted Arab
sources as saying no one was injured. Kach was founded by
American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane.
   Army spokesmen said they had reports of the incident.
   The latest leaflet was the 20th issued since a rebellion against
Israeli occupation began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians
in the occupied territories. At least 211 Palestinians and four
Israelis have been killed.
   Brig. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff, said the first six
months of the uprising cost the army $200 million, Israel radio
reported without elaborating.
   Officials said in May the violence had cost the Israeli economy
$500 million in lost tourist income, uncollected taxes and military
expenses.
   In Nablus, soldiers shot the two youths in the legs in the
market area of the old city, officials at Al Ittihad hospital said.
   The army said they were shot during protests by stone-throwing
Arabs, but one victim and witnesses to the other shooting denied
the shots were fired during protests.
   Samer Wawi said he was confronted by about a dozen troopers
leaving an alley and and was shot when he turned to go the other
way.
   ``The didn't speak to me. They only fired at me,'' Wawi, 17,
said from his hospital bed.
   A young man who said he saw the shooting of Subhi Munib Saayeh,
12, said the boy was shot when he ignored soldiers who summoned him.
   Doctors said Saayeh was shot in the right leg, just above the
ankle, and the bone was fractured.
   Before the shootings, groups of boys and teen-agers stood around
the market area cradling stones and building fires of debris.
   New graffiti reflected underground leafets' instructions to
protest Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, declared shortly
after the sector was captured from Jordan 21 years ago.
   ``Palestine without Jerusalem is like a body without a soul,''
said one slogan.
   The PLO-backed underground leadership of the uprising called
Tuesday's strike to affirm Jerusalem's ``Arab identity.''
   Authorities brought in 350 extra policemen to patrol Jerusalem,
raising the total to 1,500, Israel radio said.
   Shops were closed throughout east Jerusalem but there were no
large Arab protests. Ten Palestinian youths were arrested in
stone-throwing attacks the day before.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar Lev, speaking on Israel radio,
attributed the quiet Tuesday to the large police presence and
efforts to explain to people that Palestinian protests ``in the end
hurt the Arab residents.''
   Members of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Herut
Party held a counter-demonstration with the theme ``Jerusalem is
ours.'' About 20 cars drove through the city, Israeli flags flying
from the windows.
   ``We are going to show the Arabs the only flag allowed in Israel
is the Israeli flag,'' said Reuven Rivlen, head of Herut's
Jerusalem branch.
   Police stopped the convoy from entering the Arab village of
Jabal Mukaber in east Jerusalem, radio reports said.
   Outlawed Palestinian flags were seen flying in several cities in
the West Bank and Gaza, which also were closed down by the strike.
   Youths set tires ablaze at the entrance to Gaza City. In
Bethlehem, soldiers stood guard on the roofs of the municipal
building and the Church of the Nativity.
   Some Arabs who tried to go to their jobs in Israel on Israeli
buses were halted by stone-throwing youths. Three firebombs were
thrown at a bus in Bethlehem and a woman passenger was slightly
injured as she ran from the bus, Israel radio said.

   The Reagan administration on Tuesday
reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel's security, but told
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin the Jewish state should not use
violence to quell Palestinian unrest in the occupied territories.
   ``Neither should violence nor controls on violence become ends
in themselves, making a political solution more difficult,'' the
White House said in a statement summing up Rabin's talks with
President Reagan, Vice President George Bush, national security
adviser Colin L. Powell and other officials.
   The statement also urged Israel to show more flexibility in the
U.S. push for a Middle East peace settlement, although Rabin and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the Labor Party have expressed
general support for the U.S. peace initiative. Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir has shown little enthusiasm for it.
   ``Realism and a willingness to nurture rather than reject
possible opportunities for peace are essential, as is a climate
that makes negotiations possible,'' the White House statement said.
   The administration has been reluctant to criticize Israel's use
of force against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where 210 Palestinians and four Israeli settlers have been
killed since Arab unrest began in December.
   In its statement, the White House said: ``While Israel should
not be expected to make concessions under the threat of violence,
the preservation of order in the territories must neither provide a
justification for civilian lawlessness nor act as an excuse for
avoiding political discourse with the Palestinians of the West Bank
and Gaza.''
   When asked by reporters about criticism of Israel's policy in
the territories, Rabin said, ``I explained Israeli policy. I am not
saying that everyone here is in agreement with our policy, but we
are a free, independent state.''
   ``When it comes to Israel's security and Israel's defense,'' he
said, ``we feel that we are free to act as it is needed to prevent
any damage to our future and our security.''
   Following his meeting with Reagan on Tuesday, Rabin told
reporters he was ``going back home quite satisfied'' with his
expectations of continued U.S. aid.
   ``The framework of the support will be basically the same as it
used to be,'' he said. ``We also are aware of other problems that
the United States faces; we know of the problems about foreign aid
bills and about the defense bills.''
   ``As long as we will be able to keep in reality the same level
of support, we are satisfied,'' he said.
   Israel, the largest single recipient of U.S. aid, received about
$3 billion in total military and economic assistance in the current
year. Under legislation now before Congress, there is an identical
appropriation proposed for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   Besides Reagan and Powell, Rabin also met with Secretary of
Defense Frank C. Carlucci and Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
among others.
   ``We concluded basically the framework, the format of assistance
to Israel vis-a-vis fiscal year '90,'' he said.
   He said they discussed ways of reducing proliferation of
ground-to-ground missiles in the Middle East and of neutralizing
damage from the weapons.
   The White House said during Reagan's meeting with Rabin, the
president noted that the United States and Israel soon will sign a
memorandum of understanding for the joint development of an
anti-ballistic missile which will be able to deal with a tactical
ballistic missile threat.
   It said the American contribution will be about 80 percent and
the Israeli contribution 20 percent. ``This joint development is an
outgrowth of research on SDI,'' the Star Wars program, the
statement said.
   ``The president expressed his concern about ominous new military
developments in the region,'' it said. ``In particular, he called
attention to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and chemical
capabilities. He observed that such capabilities could change the
military situation, making any future war far more costly,
difficult to control and dangerous.''
   The statement said that both Reagan and Bush emphasized in their
meetings with Rabin ``the need for international efforts to stop
this proliferation. They also stressed that these trends put a
premium both on continuing U.S.-Israeli defense cooperation and
energetically working for peace in the area.''

   Top U.S. and Australian officials met Tuesday
in the annual ministerial session of the U.S.-Southwest Pacific
military alliance that formerly included New Zealand.
   New Zealand was absent for the third straight year as a result
of its ban against visits by nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered
warships and the U.S. refusal to confirm or deny which vessels are
atomic.
   Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci represented the United States at the two-day meeting with
the Australian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Bill Hayden and
Defense Minister Kim Beazley.
   The meetings were held at Blair House, the restored U.S.
presidential guest residence facing the White House across
Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Beazley told reporters after his arrival in Washington he
considers it ``very important to hold open the possibility'' of
bringing New Zealand back nto the alliance. But he said he saw no
development ``in either New Zealand or U.S. policy pointing to
compromise'' of the port visit dispute.
   Australia had criticized U.S. farm supports at previous annual
meetings and was expected to do it again this year. Prime Minister
Bob Hawke, visiting Washington last week, said despite being ``a
first class ally,'' Australia gets second class treatment from the
United States on trade matters.
   Subsidized U.S. wheat exports have reduced the Australian share
of the world wheat market from 20 percent to 12 percent during the
last three years, Hawke said. He warned that any further impact
could ``corrode'' Australian public opinion against America.

   Romania ordered the immediate closure of
a Hungarian consulate on Tuesday and expelled the consular staff,
the Hungarian state news agency MTI reported, in a widening rift
between the two communist neighbors.
   The action was unprecedented in recent Soviet bloc diplomatic
history. Romania and Hungary are military allies in the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   The decision to close the Hungarian general consulate in
Cluj-Napoca was apparently prompted by a demonstration of about
50,000 Hungarians in Budapest Monday night to protest a project
calling for demolition of 7,000 Romanian villages, including ethnic
Hungarian communities, by the year 2000.
   Cluj-Napoca is a city in Transylvania in northwestern Romania
where most of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians live. Hungarians
know it as Kolozsvar.
   Ethnic Hungarians have long complained about alleged
discrimination and denial of ethnic rights. They form the largest
minority group in East Europe outside the Soviet Union.
   MTI said Foreign Minister Ioan Totu called in Hungarian
Ambassador Pal Szucs on Tuesday and told him Romania considers
operation of the consulate as ``terminated with immediate effect.''
   According to MTI, Romania demanded that the staff ``leave the
territory of Romania within 48 hours.''
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu on Tuesday rejected all
criticism of his village demolition program and accused Hungarian
authorities of actively supporting the unofficial protest.
   In a speech to the Romanian Communist Party's Central Committee
in Bucharest, Ceausescu hinted that he may direct the Hungarian
Embassy in Budapest to scale down operations following the protest
rally.
   The resettlement plan calls for 7,000 of Romania's 13,000
villages to be torn down and replaced with agricultural-industrial
centers. Romanian state-run media said the goal is to gain more
farmland for use by the country's collectivized agriculture, which
is plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and livestock fodder
shortages.
   The protesters Monday night filed quietly past the Romanian
Embassy in the biggest unofficial rally in Hungary since the 1956
Hungarian uprising. Police did not interfere.
   The Hungarian government newspaper Magyar Hirlap on Tuesday
praised the marchers' discipline.
   But Ceausescu denounced ``new actions of a chauvinistic,
nationalistic, anti-Romanian, anti-socialist nature'' in Hungary.
   He told the party meeting: ``Yesterday a new manifestation was
organized with the agreement and _ as stated even by news coming
from Hungary _ under the aegis of the official party and state
bodies of Hungary,'' the state news agency Agerpres reported.
   As reported by Agerpres, Ceausescu also sought to depict the
growing chorus of Hungarian protests as means to make people forget
about Hungary's serious economic problems.
   The MTI agency said ``responsibility for violating the consular
agreement'' lies with Romania. It added that ``this severe Romanian
measure'' will not divert Hungary from ``its principled policy
aimed at deepening friendship between the Hungarian and Romanian
peoples, strengthening the connecting role of the nationalities
living in their countries.''
   Both the Hungarian government and speakers at Monday's rally
made it clear that a change of existing borders is out of the
question. Under the 1920 Trianon Treaty, predominantly Hungarian
Transylvania became part of Romania.
   Hungary's premier and Communist Party chief, Karoly Grosz, is
scheduled to visit Romania, probably in late summer.
   Ceausescu said issues between the two parties and countries must
be solved ``exclusively by way of talks, in a spirit of equality,
respect and non-interference in the domestic affairs of either
country.''

   President Reagan bid farewell Tuesday to chief
of staff Howard H. Baker Jr., thanking him for piloting the White
House staff through the difficult days of the Iran-Contra
investigation.
   ``A tone of cooperation and conciliation in those early months
of 1987 was communicated to the public and to those in Congress,''
Reagan told Baker in a letter released by the White House.
   ``At the same time, the White House functioned efficiently and
effectively in setting out and pursuing my policy goals. I clearly
appreciate the challenges you faced,'' Reagan said.
   Baker, in his letter to Reagan, said he'd been called upon to
``navigate the troubled waters of the Iran-Contra affair. I believe
that task is now behind us, and I think your representations have
been fully supported by the record.''
   He also cited the completion of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
intermediate-range nuclear weapons, calling the past 16 months
``among the most energetic and successful of your administration.''
   Baker, whose wife Joy has been in ill health recently, cited
personal reasons when he resigned earlier this month. The former
senator from Tennessee and Senate majority leader assumed the chief
of staff position after the departure of Donald T. Regan in the
wake of the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``No one understands better than Nancy and I the personal
reasons that lead you to relinquish your responsibilities at this
time. That too, is a tribute to your character and your
integrity,'' Reagan wrote.
   ``With all the years you and I have been associated, this truly
is no farewell, but rather a note of enduring and heartfelt thanks
for a job well done.''
   Baker's deputy, Kenneth Duberstein, is succeeding as him chief
of staff.

<HEAD>Justice Employees File Suit Against Random Drug Testing Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit challenging Attorney General Edwin
Meese III's plan to conduct random drug testing of Justice
Department officials was filed Tuesday by 42 employees, mostly
trial attorneys and several supervisors.
   The lawsuit contends that random drug testing of employees in
sensitive jobs is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy that
violates the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches.
   The suit, filed a day after the Justice Department announced
plans to begin random testing in two months, also contends that the
program is being implemented ``without any factual showing of a
problem of drug use in the department.''
   The plan is ``arbitrary, capricious and abuse of discretion''
because it ``would not require any suspicion that a particular
individual has used drugs prior to testing, and would subject
employees to urinalysis tests for drug use even though such tests
do not indicate whether employees are impaired in their job
performance by drug use,'' said the lawsuit filed by former
Maryland attorney general Stephen H. Sachs, who has also served as
a U.S. attorney in the state.
   The 42 plaintiffs named in the suit were mostly Justice
Department trial attorneys plus several supervisors, including
three deputy chiefs of the civil rights division's criminal
section: Barry Kowalski, Daniel L. Bell and Norajean M. Flanagan.
   Arthur Spitzer, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney
involved in the case, said he had spoken to a number of other
Justice Department officials who privately supported the lawsuit
but didn't want to join it for fear of hurting their careers.
   The drug testing plan is part of the Reagan administration's
program for a ``drug-free workplace'' in the federal government.
Random drug testing has been challenged by a number of federal
employee groups.
   Several federal appellate courts have upheld various kinds of
drug testing programs. But these courts have yet to rule
definitively on challenges to widespread random drug testing of
federal workers under the ``drug-free workplace'' program.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington is scheduled to
hear arguments next fall on challenges to drug testing of
Transportation Department and civilian Army employees.
   The same court ruled last year that the invasion of privacy
entailed by testing could not be justified if the test didn't
produce evidence that employees were impaired by drug use while on
the job.

   A former Fresno State University professor
was found guilty of first-degree murder Tuesday in the slaying of a
teen-age male prostitute whose body was found cut into pieces that
were scattered as far as 200 miles apart.
   Max Bernard Franc stood calmly beside his attorney, Mark
Kaiserman, as the verdict was read in a silent courtroom. He showed
no immediate reaction to the verdict but leaned forward to listen
closely as the jury's decision was announced.
   Jurors deliberated 2{ days before returning their verdict.
   The victim, Tracy Leroy Nute, was an 18-year-old runaway from
Kansas City, Mo., who came to California to be a movie star and
wound up working as a prostitute.
   Franc, 58, a public administration professor at Fresno until his
arrest in August, was charged with shooting Nute last August, then
dismembering his body and disposing of it between Fresno and
Valencia.
   His arrest came after a chain saw he had rented was returned
with bits of flesh and blood in its inner workings.
   Franc said he didn't commit the murder and blamed a transient
named Terry Adams. ``Adams'' never was found, and the prosecutor
claimed he was ``a phantom'' invented by Franc.
   Forensic experts found traces of blood throughout Franc's West
Hollywood apartment as well as in his car. The murder weapon was
found in Franc's university office. And a motorist identified Franc
as the man he saw sitting in a car near a freeway offramp where
body parts were found.
   During the four-week trial, witnesses described the bespectacled
defendant as ``a sissy.'' His lawyer argued that Franc had neither
the physical strength nor the personality necessary to commit the
killing.
   Testimony about Franc's lifestyle disclosed the double life he
had lived for years. In Fresno,he was a conservative public
administration professor. But in West Hollywood he was a homosexual
voyeur who paid young men to be photographed in sexual poses.
   During their deliberations, jurors played tapes of Franc's
interviews with police after his arrest.
   At first, he claimed he used the chain saw to cut up a dog he
had killed with his car. Later, he claimed the dog belonged to
underworld figures and Adams used the saw to cut up the ``Mafia
dog.'' Ultimately he said Adams shot Nute in his apartment and used
the saw to dismember the body.
   The former professor did not testify at his trial.

<HEAD>North's Attorneys Attack Judge's Rulings On Immunity Question</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 4 grafs with defense motion on judge's criticism</NOTE>

   The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case
was accused Tuesday of unfairly denying Oliver L. North the chance
to prove that his congressional testimony was illegally used
against him by prosecutors.
   Lawyers for the fired White House aide charged that U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ``placed speed before fundamental
fairness'' by ruling the case should go to trial without further
proceedings on the issue of congressional immunity given North and
two co-defendants.
   Gesell's procedures for conducting his inquiry and the reasoning
behind his conclusions ``are most notable for their arbitrariness,
their superficiality, and their unprecedented denial of due
process,'' said the brief filed by North's lawyers, Brendan V.
Sullivan Jr. and Barry Simon.
   ``The procedures employed stand as a striking departure from
this court's long tradition of fair and even-handed adjudication,''
the brief said in one of several scathing attacks on the judge's
handling of the immunity question.
   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and
arms dealer Albert Hakim all claimed that independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh made impermissible use of the testimony they gave
congressional hearings last year under grants of limited immunity
from prosecution.
   Gesell has rejected defense motions to dismiss charges against
the three on the ground that Walsh's investigation was tainted by
exposure to widespread publicity of the trio's congressional
testimony.
   To counter some of the legal problems posed by immunity, Gesell
also ordered that North, Poindexter, Hakim and retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord be tried separately on charges of
conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms
sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Secord testified on Capitol Hill without an immunity grant.
   In their latest pleading, North's lawyers said they found ``most
shocking'' the judge's ``outright refusal'' to allow the defense to
present witnesses at an April 25 hearing to determine whether
Walsh's staff was exposed to congressional testimony.
   The judge was also criticized for abruptly canceling a
subsequent hearing on the issue of whether the defendants'
immunized congressional testimony was used by government lawyers to
prepare federal officials before appearances before the Iran-Contra
grand jury.
   At the outset of the April 25 hearing, Gesell said he would not
allow the defense to present testimony because it had violated his
orders by subpoenaing government officials and a wide range of
documents for the proceeding.
   Gesell abruptly canceled the June 13 hearing after similar
subpoenas for documents were issued by defense lawyers. In both
cases, the judge quashed the subpoenas at the request of Walsh.
   In their latest filing, North's lawyers said they had evidence
that attorneys for the CIA, the White House and the State and
Justice departments ``relied upon the immunized testimony'' to
prepare government officials for questioning by the Iran-Contra
grand jury.
   Evidence to support this claim was filed under seal by the
defense lawyers.
   In his June 16 opinion, Gesell said his findings on the immunity
issue were provisional and depended on what happened during North's
trial. The judge said he would convene a post-trial hearing on the
issue if such a proceeding were necessary.
   In an separate and highly unusual motion, North's lawyers moved
to strike from the record Gesell's ``unjustified criticism of
defense counsel'' during a June 6 hearing.
   During the proceeding, Gesell said defense lawyers had not told
the court that Secord had been inteviewed 10 times by Walsh's
office. Gesell said he had ``discovered it buried in a footnote in
a brief.''
   When Secord's attorney, Thomas Green, told the judge that no one
attempted to mislead the court, Gesell replied: ``I didn't suggest
you did. I said that I was surprised that you did.''
   In their pleading, North's lawyers said Gesell had been informed
of Secord's meetings with Walsh's staff on three previous occasions.

<HEAD>Heidnik Jury Hears Closing Arguments In Torture-Murder Case
^Eds: Note contents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Michael Heidnik committed ``horrible''
acts by chaining women and torturing them, two until they died, but
he is insane, not guilty of first-degree murder, his lawyer said
Tuesday in closing arguments.
   The prosecutor, however, argued Heidnik ``knew what he was doing
and he knew it was wrong.''
   ``This man conducted repeated sadistic acts on six defenseless
persons,'' Assistant District Attorney Charles Gallagher said.
``What he did was premeditated, deliberate murder.''
   Following Tuesday's closing arguments, the jury will be given
instructions Wednesday before beginning deliberations. The jury was
selected in Pittsburgh because of intense publicity about the case
in eastern Pennsylvania.
   Gallagher pressed for a first-degree murder conviction, for
which Heidnik could face a death sentence. The prosecutor also
sought convictions on six counts of kidnapping, five counts of
rape, four of aggravated assault and one of abuse of a corpse.
   Heidnik, 44, was arrested in March 1987, after one captive
escaped from Heidnik's car and alerted police. He is accused of
luring women to his basement torture chamber, where he chained them
and raped them repeatedly in hopes of breeding a ``superior race,''
between November 1986 and his arrest.
   He used a chain saw to cut up the remains of one woman and then
fed the remains mixed with dog food to the other women, according
to police and trial testimony. The body of the second woman was
found in the woods in New Jersey.
   All four survivors testified about their experiences during the
seven-day trial in Common Pleas Court.
   The bearded Heidnik, wearing the black, flowered Hawaiian-style
sport shirt he has worn most days, ignored the lawyers Tuesday.
   ``A person who holds women captive in chains, and kills two of
them, and feeds them dog food and human flesh, is insane,'' argued
Heidnik's lawyer, A. Charles Peruto Jr. ``What was his purpose? To
raise 10 babies from 10 different women in his basement. Does that
make sense?''
   ``Even though we have conceded he committed those horrible acts,
we have not conceded first-degree murder,'' Peruto argued.
   ``The commonwealth says the defendant fooled all the doctors,
that he faked schizophrenia for 25 years. If you don't believe that
you have to say he was insane. Certainly he knew he was hiding the
bodies, certainly he knew what he was doing, but he thought it was
right.''
   Gallagher challenged the reliability of medical experts who said
Heidnik was mentally ill. Two experts testified for the defense,
saying that Heidnik was schizophrenic and had been in and out of
mental institutions over 20 years.
   ``If you rely on the evidence, you will realize that this man is
not legally insane (and that he) is guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' Gallagher said.
   ``He repeatedly raped these `girls' for his own sadistic sexual
pleasure. How was he described when Sandra Lindsay died. He was
obsessed, but not sorry. And when Debbie Dudley was electrocuted he
wasn't unhappy.
   ``Does this show he was psychotic? I say it does not,''
Gallagher said. ``What he did was premeditated, deliberate murder.
Reject the very idea that this man is legally insane.''
   Peruto said the actions Gallagher outlined proved Heidnik was
out of touch with reality:
   ``When he cut up that woman with a hacksaw, what kind of person
is that? And then eating some of the flesh, and wrapping up the
rest and putting it into his freezer. Who was trying to impress
when he did that? Was he faking a mental illness?
   ``This case is about mental capability. Was the defendant able
to plan killings? Did he intend to kill? I say that he didn't. He
is insane and you can't get around it.''

   Workers with heavy machinery tore apart the
wreckage of two commuter trains Tuesday and found more bodies,
raising to 59 the number killed in a head-on crash the railroad
blamed on a brake problem.
   Officials of the state-run rail company said the veteran
engineer on the runaway train realized his brakes weren't working
more than a mile from the busy Gare de Lyon station, and warned his
passengers to get to the back of the train before impact.
   The rail company also disclosed that the engineer first realized
there was a brake problem after the train had been stopped five
miles from the accident site by a passenger who had pulled an
emergency cord.
   One of the 38 people injured in the crash was not freed from the
wreckage until 5 a.m. Tuesday _ more than 10 hours after the
accident at 7:10 p.m. Monday _ and rescuers said she probably
survived because the bodies around her protected her from the
jagged metal.
   An official of the rail company Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer, or SNCF, said he was certain it was a brake problem that sent
an eight-car suburban train hurtling at 40-50 mph into a stopped
train. An investigation was opened to determine the specific cause
of the accident.
   Raoul Viger, spokesman for the fire and rescue workers, said 55
was the final number of dead, but the company said later that 59
were killed. At least two victims died in the hospital of injuries
suffered in the accident, city emergency services reported.
   Viger said the young survivor was found conscious at 8 p.m.
Monday and wasn't freed until about nine hours later. She did not
need to have any of her limbs amputated.
   Firefighters who were exhausted after so many hours of working
among the dead and suffering began to gather up their equipment
Tuesday afternoon after the trains were separated.
   At the height of the operation, 250 rescue workers struggled to
pull survivors out, and 40 fire engines, 15 ambulances and a
helicopter were at the station.
   Roger Gerin, the company official, said at a news conference
that Daniel Saulin, the engineer of the moving train, realized his
brakes were malfunctioning when he was about 1\ miles from the
station and he communicated with the Gare de Lyon.
   ``He told his passengers to change cars and go to the back of
the train,'' Gerin said.
   ``At 600 meters, the train ... ran through an activated stop
signal without the power to stop,'' Gerin said, adding that Saulin,
42, jumped free of the train and survived.
   The engineer on the train in the station, Andre Tanguy, was
killed in the crash. Railway spokesman Francis Boulanger said
earlier reports that he escaped might have resulted from confusion
with other rail employees who jumped from the train. Boulanger said
Tanguy was one of seven employees who died.
   The rail agency, the Transport Ministry and judicial authorities
will conduct separate investigations into the crash, said Philippe
Rouvillois, director general of the rail company. They will
``exclude no hypothesis,'' he said.
   Gerin said one certainty was that the ``origin of the accident
was in difficulties with the braking system, but we do not know the
exact cause.''
   He said both engineers were well qualified and that Saulin had
14 years experience.
   Before the accident, Saulin's train had made 15 stops and the
brakes worked normally at each, Gerin said.
   A passenger pulled an alarm signal, causing the train to halt at
Vert de Maisons, a station five miles from Paris that is not
normally a stop, Gerin said.
   ``During this 26-minute stop, the engineer experienced
difficulty in trying to re-arm the brake system, but he resumed his
trip,'' he said.
   ``There is a tie, the nature of which we do not yet know,
between the use of the alarm signal (emergency stop) which had
immobilized the train a short time before ... and the catastrophe.''
   In addition, Gerin said, the stop at Vert de Maisons
disorganized rail traffic and contributed to delays of many trains,
among them the other one involved in the accident.
   Gerin said trains undergo maintenance four times a year in
addition to routine checks and the train that failed to stop was
checked three days ago.
   The last major train accident in Paris was in January 1981 at
the Auber station, when two suburban trains collided, killing one
person and injuring 71.
   The third worst train accident in history occurred in France on
Dec. 12, 1917, when more than 550 were killed at St. Michel De
Maurienne. The worst was in Samastipur, India, June 5, 1981, when
900 died.

<TEXT>
   Farmers who grow the raw material for
cocaine demanded Tuesday that 40 U.S. soldiers and drug agents
leave the Chapare coca leaf-growing region, where six farmers were
killed the day before.
   James Danbridge, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, said
there are ``no plans to remove U.S. personnel from the Chapare.''
The 40 Americans operate in the region in conjunction with Bolivian
authorities.
   A spokesman for the Chapare federation of coca growers, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said farmers will respond with
violence and road blocks if the Americans remain. The coca farmers
oppose U.S.-backed legislation that would declare most coca
plantations in the Chapare illegal.
   Several thousand farmers and workers gathered in Cochabamba, a
city 90 southwest of the Chapare, on Tuesday to protest the six
deaths and the anti-narcotics law Bolivian legislators are
considering.
   On Monday, at least 5,000 coca farmers briefly overran a
Bolivian police and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency base in Villa
Tunari, a Chapare village, said Jorge Alderrete, undersecretary in
the Interior Ministry.
   Dandridge said five DEA agents on the base at the time were not
hurt.
   Police fired shots and tear gas at the mob to regain control of
the base, killing two farmers, Bolivian authorities reported. A
police spokesman said officers arrested several farmers carrying
dynamite and weapons.
   Four farmers were reported killed and scores injured Monday when
Bolivian anti-drug police attacked a blockade erected on the main
road through the Chapare, a lush tropical region 240 miles east of
La Paz.
   Another confrontation occurred north of the roadblock, at
Ivirgarzama village, when officers dispersed a group of farmers.
Police said at least four farmers were injured, one seriously.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro's government said Tuesday that
trouble was being fomented by cocaine traffickers opposed to the
anti-narcotics legislation, which would impose stiff penalties on
them in addition to declaring plantations illegal.
   Military and police units were sent into the Chapare on Tuesday
to protect the anti-narcotics police and U.S. military and DEA
camps. Security teams patrolled in helicopters and armored
vehicles, officials said.
   At least 350,000 farmers live in the Chapare, which is about the
size of New Jersey. Coca growing or cocaine processing provides the
livelihood of most.
   Coca farmers have held protest marches in recent weeks against
the legislation. Part of the U.S. aid program is contingent on the
Bolivian Congress passing the law, and it is expected to do so this
week.
   More than 100,000 acres of Bolivian farmland are planted in
coca, which produces 90 metric tons of cocaine when refined _ about
one-third of world production, according to a U.S. Embassy report.
   Authorities have increased interdiction efforts in the Chapare
this year with the aid of U.S. military, DEA and Border Patrol
personnel, and the police say five tons of cocaine paste has been
captured.
   ``Bolivia has made more progress in combating the cocaine trade
than any other South American country,'' U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III said during a recent visit.

   Leaders of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, hit by a federal racketeering suit Tuesday, denied that
their union was controlled by the Mafia and said the suit was
un-American.
   ``It's pure myth that this organization is in any way influenced
or controlled by organized crime,'' Teamsters lawyer John Climaco
told a news conference at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where the union
general executive is holding its quarterly meeting.
   ``It's totally un-American and it's wrong.''
   The suit was filed in federal court in New York by U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani.
   The union's acting president, Weldon Mathis, called it ``a
vicious anti-labor attack'' and ``a shameful attempt to destroy a
democratic union. It will not be tolerated.''
   The leaders declined to outline how they will fight the suit.
``We're not going to litigate this in front of the media,'' Climaco
said.
   ``I'm shocked and surprised that anyone who had reviewed this
case, not in the Soviet Union, not in Poland, but in the United
States of America, would take such action,'' Climaco said.

   Workers using an acid to clean a 5-foot-tall
tank created a deadly gas that killed four people and injured 20
others at a metal platings plant Tuesday.
   One worker was in critical condition. Fifteen of the injured
were rescuers wearing self-contained breathing units who were
affected by the gas because it can be absorbed through the skin,
said Robert Corkwell, a hazardous materials officer with the
Indiana State Police.
   Workers at Bastian Plating Co. who were cleaning a tank with an
acid solution caused the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide to form,
officials said. It had not been determined how that happened.
   Three to 4 inches of chemical residue and sludge were inside the
tank at the time of the cleaning, said Corkwell. An independent lab
later determined that cyanides, which could have come from the
cleaning solution, were present in the tank, he said.
   ``The one guy who's in ... Fort Wayne, he might be able to tell
us (what happened) when he comes around,'' said police Detective
David Bundy. He referred to Craig Fogel, 19, of Auburn, who was
listed in critical condition at Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne.
   Bastian Vice President Dennis Fry said he did not know how many
workers were in the plant when the accident occurred. The plant,
which employs about 30 people, makes dyes and chromate dip used to
color electroplated products.
   Corkwell said one of the workers was inside the vat, which was 5
feet high and 5 feet in diameter.
   Killed were plant workers Barron W. Sweet, 21, of Garrett; Larry
D. Hensinger, 29, of Waterloo; William M. Freeze, 29, of Garrett;
and Jeffery Link of Auburn, said Dr. William Hathaway, DeKalb
County coroner. Link's age was not immediately available.
   Of the 20 people injured, five were plant workers, three were
Auburn police officers and 12 were city firefighters. Sixteen were
treated and released.
   In addition to Fogel, two other workers were hospitalized at
Parkview, one in fair condition and one admitted for observation. A
police officer was in satisfactory condition at DeKalb Memorial
Hospital.
   Sharon Cramer said her son, Patrick, one of the workers
hospitalized, had told her he had tried to pull one of his
co-workers out of the fumes but lost consciousness himself.
   She said her son had worked at the plant as a stacker since
January.
   ``The first thing he said to me was, `I won't work there
anymore,' '' Mrs. Cramer told The Fort Wayne News-Sentinel.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill To Crack Down on Telemarketing Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved a bill designed
to crack down on telemarketing fraud, which is estimated to cost
American consumers at least $1 billion a year.
   By a voice vote, the House passed the measure which directs the
Federal Trade Commission to draft rules governing sales by
telephone and would make it easier to sue telemarketing companies.
   The bill does not specify the content of the rules, but says the
agency should consider including provisions that establish refund
rights for customers and a period during which consumers can
withdraw their order and set a time of day when unsolicited calls
can be made.
   ``No piece of legislation is going to end fraud,'' Rep. Thomas
A. Luken, D-Ohio, said during debate on the bill Monday. ``But I
think this bill will significantly reduce the losses now being
suffered by American consumers.''
   The FTC estimates that telemarketing sales in 1986 amounted to
more than $100 billion. The agency, however, has been able to get
back only about $25 million for defrauded consumers over the past
four years, he said.
   Under the bill, states and private individuals would be able to
sue telemarketing companies in federal court. Currently, suits must
be brought in state courts, making it difficult to prosecute
telemarketers that conduct interstate business, which most
companies do.
   The measure will help legitimate telemarketing companies ``by
removing the bad actors from the scene and restoring the confidence
of the American consumer in the products they buy over the
telephone,'' said Rep. Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio.

<HEAD>Canadian Charged With Spying for the Soviets Appears in Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old Canadian charged
with spying for the Soviet Union appeared in provincial court
Tuesday and opted for a trial by judge and jury on three counts of
espionage.
   Stephen Ratkai, wearing plaid pants and a T-shirt, entered the
courtroom in handcuffs under police escort. Spectators and
reporters were searched at the door.
   He was ordered held without bail until a preliminary hearing
Aug. 29.
   Ratkai was arrested June 11 at a St. John's hotel and charged
under the Official Secrets Act with trying to obtain U.S. military
secrets for the Soviets.
   Born in Nova Scotia of a Hungarian father and a Canadian mother,
Ratkai moved to Hungary at an early age to live with his
grandmother. He returned to Canada a few years later and has
traveled to Hungary several times since.
   The Canadian Security Intelligence Service investigation focused
on the U.S. naval base at Argentia, Newfoundland, which monitors
the movement of Soviet submarines in the Atlantic.
   Four days later, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney expelled eight
Soviet diplomats and officials and barred nine others from
returning to Canada because of alleged espionage activities.
   That led to a series of retaliatory expulsions and barrings by
the two sides involving 32 of their representatives. The exchange
finally cooled off Monday, when Foreign Minister Joe Clark met
Soviet Ambassador Alexei Rodionov in Ottawa to begin to rebuild
relations.
   Security sources linked the expulsions to the purported Soviet
attempt to infiltrate Argentia and to parallel operations at
Paramax Electronics in Montreal, a U.S. subsidiary making guidance
and communications systems for a new generation of Canadian
frigates.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitian police have rounded up at
least 45 school-age children in a wealthy suburb of the capital on
grounds they are beggars who must be taken off the streets, Radio
Haiti-Inter reported Tuesday.
   Between 2,000 and 3,000 homeless children are believed to live
on the streets of Port-au-Prince, sleeping on the sidewalks.
   Capt. Irving Mehu, head of the police barracks in Petionville in
the southern part of the city, acknowledged in the radio report
that 45 youngsters were detained.
   He said they were waifs and beggars and were taken temporarily
to a children's home in Carrefour, a slum in the northern part of
the capital.
   According to the radio report, however, members of a delegation
of children that went to the station said not all of those detained
were street urchins. They said some were students on school
vacations who were detained while playing in the square outside the
police barracks.
   They said the arrests started last Thursday with 28 detentions.
Members of the delegation said most of those detained had been
released to their parents but some still were being held.
   A reporter for the station said the children were believed to
range in age from 7 to 14.
   A witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she saw
seven or eight boys aged 12 to 14 sweeping the sidewalks and
driveway of the police barracks Monday and their parents brought
them food.
   Another resident of the area said he saw five children arrested
near the square Sunday.

   Many defense contractors did a slipshod job of
protecting classified information, according to a Pentagon study
that then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger tried to withhold
from Congress last year, sources say.
   The study by the Defense Investigative Service found that only
10 percent of the contractors surveyed had no deficiencies in the
way they handled classified information related to ``special access
programs,'' the highest level of secrecy. And more than half fell
into categories that were either ``unsatisfactory'' or
``exceedingly serious.''
   The 80-page report was done in response to a congressional
demand in the wake of reports that Lockheed, one of the nation's
biggest defense contractors, couldn't account for 1,400 documents
relating to the top-secret ``Stealth'' airplane.
   The DIS study is not directly related to the current criminal
investigation of the Pentagon and defense contractors. That probe
centers on allegations that defense contractors and consultants,
many of whom are former military men, bribed Pentagon officials for
information crucial to winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   The report is itself classified and has not been publicly
released. But its contents were described by sources who had access
to the document.
   The study was finished in April 1987, but Weinberger refused to
send it to Capitol Hill until last October 2, hours before a House
panel's vote to subpoena the document, the sources said.
   Instead, Weinberger sent a June 17, 1987 letter, noting the
study was finished and describing what he said were its contents.
   Weinberger wrote that security of classified information ``was
outstanding in some (contractors), satisfactory in the vast
majority, and unsatisfactory in a few contractor locations.''
   The study painted a far different picture, the sources said.
   Attempts to reach Weinberger for an explanation were
unsuccessful. He did not return telephone calls to his law office
seeking comment.
   The study looked at 101 different programs at 603 contractor
sites, the sources said. Many of the facilities worked on more than
one classified program.
   The DIS created five categories for assessing how contractors
handled the highly classified data. The lowest was unsatisfactory;
next lowest was ``major deficiencies;'' then came ``letter of
requirement,'' which meant problems were discovered that had to be
corrected, with the remedies confirmed in writing. Second-best was
``corrected on the spot,'' and the best was no deficiencies, the
sources said.
   Only 10 percent of the contractors had no deficiencies, the
sources said. Six percent were rated unsatisfactory, 47 percent had
major deficiencies, 34 percent had ``letter of requirement''
deficiencies, and 3 percent had problems that were corrected on the
spot.
   Weinberger's letter may have used some semantical logic by
counting anyone who ranked above the lowest DIS grade of
``unsatisfactory'' when he said security was ``satisfactory'' in
the vast majority of contractor sites. But that also would entail
using the word ``satisfactory'' in regard to contractors whose
deficiencies the DIS itself labeled as ``exceedingly serious.''
   In the report, the DIS defined ``major deficiencies,'' the grade
given the largest group of contractors, as ``deficiencies which
were exceedingly serious and which resulted in the compromise of
classified information or (which) could have logically led to a
compromise if not properly corrected.''
   According to DIS, ``unsatisfactory'' meant ``the contractor
appears to be either unwilling or unable to take prompt corrective
action to safeguard classified information which appears to be in
imminent danger.''
   Weinberger has defended his Pentagon tenure, saying he wasn't
responsible for abuses which occurred while he was defense
secretary. ``I don't have any basis whatever for saying I didn't do
enough, and I certainly don't feel culpable,''Weinberger said
Sunday on an ABC-TV show.
   But Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said on the same show ``we warned Mr.
Weinberger'' there were problems in the way contractors handled
classified information.
   Between 1984 and 1986, the Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee held 17 public hearings on defense contractors, many
of them focusing on specific weapons and contractors, subcommittee
records show.
   The DIS study originated in August, 1986, when Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., won approval of an amendment to the fiscal 1987 budget bill
requiring the review. Wyden is the ranking Democrat on the
subcommittee.
   Wyden said he wasn't satisfied by Weinberger's June 17 letter
because ``our subcommittee had been investigating this issue and
his letter just didn't feel right. I felt it was a whitewash. And
then we heard from some people over in the Pentagon that
Weinberger's letter was far different from what the DIS report
said.''
   The DIS report wasn't sent to Capitol Hill until Oct. 2, hours
before the subcommittee was scheduled to vote on whether to try to
subpoena the report. The panel went ahead anyway and voted for the
subpoena, but the action was never ratified by the full committee
or House because the report had already been sent, Wyden noted.

   The military said Tuesday a
combined force of Cuban and Angolan troops suffered 200 dead in
attacks on a dam South African forces were guarding inside Angola
and that 12 South Africans also were killed.
   The South African Defense Force said the Calueque dam, which
supplies water to the South African-controlled territory of
northern Namibia, was attacked by land and air on Monday and that
South African troops destroyed many tanks and armored personnel.
One South African was killed in ground fighting, it said.
   It said 11 South Africans were killed later Monday in an air
raid which damaged the dam wall, its electricity supply and the
pipelines which carry water to northern Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa.
   South Africa refuses to say how many of its troops are in
Angola. Thousands entered last year and engaged in battles with
Cubans and Angolan government troops. South Africa supports UNITA,
the anti-Marxist National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, which has been fighting for 13 years for a power-sharing
agreement.
   South Africa, Cuba, Angola and the United States, which also
supports the UNITA guerrillas, finished a third round of peace
talks in Cairo, Egypt last weekend. The talks were aimed at
achieving withdrawal of all foreign troops from Angola and bringing
independence to Namibia, formally known as South-West Africa.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department's top contracting
official, irritated with the ``sensational'' conduct of federal
agents looking for evidence of fraud, last month tried to limit
searches of defense plants by investigators looking for corruption.
   The official, Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense for
acquisiton, wrote a memo to Defense Secrertary Frank Carlucci
suggesting that top Pentagon officials _ including himself _ be
given veto power over searches of contractor facilities.
   The suggestion to involve politically appointed Pentagon
officials in what is normally a law enforcement function was made
in a May 5 memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated
Press.
   Costello is to testify Wednesday at a House Armed Services
Committee investigation into the procurement process, a hearing
triggered by allegations of widespread corruption in the defense
contracting industry.
   Costello's memo was written before the existence of a massive
two-year investigation of defense contract fraud became publicly
known on June 14.
   That probe has relied heavily on a series of nationwide searches
of private consultants' offices and contractor facilities in
attempts looking for evidence of possible bribery of government
officials in return for classified documents.
   Costello's idea was rejected by Carlucci, whose spokesman called
the idea ``something Carlucci doesn't want to be associated with.''
   The spokesman, Air Force Col. David J. Shea, acknowledged,
however, that Carlucci initially responded ``This is a good idea.''
But he said that response referred to Costello's suggestion to
establish a training program for Defense Department investigators,
not to the prior approvalof search warrants.
   Costello's suggestion also was turned down by Pentagon Inspector
General June Gibbs Brown, according to a Pentagon source, speaking
only on condition he not be named.
   The source said Ms. Brown ``indicated to Mr. Carlucci the
Department of Justice will not accept a procedure whereby use of
search warrants by defense criminal investigative organizations
would require concurrence of any official outside the office of
inspector general.''
   Costello's memo said ``the appropriate level of review and@or
approval should be at least (Deputy Secretary of Defense) Will Taft
or myself, and quite possibly yourself.''
   Costello's anger was triggered by a search Feb. 25 at the
Electronic & Space Division of Emerson Electric Co. near St. Louis,
in a fraud investigation that is apparently not related to the
nationwide probe.
   The search was partly based on an affidavit by John E. Lake, an
agent of the Defense Criminal Investigation Service. The company
responded to the search with a court suit asking that it be
declared unconstitutional.
   In court papers filed by Emerson, the company said government
agents lied or left out important information when they asked for a
search warrant.
   The government's application included an affidavit by Lake, who
said that in October, he began investigating ``fraudulent billings
for contracts performed for the Department of Defense.''
   Authorities said Emerson violated federal law by billing the
government for parts that were installed on vehicles the company
was making for Egypt under a separate contract.
   Emerson acknowledged it transferred the parts but said that it
did so under a written ``borrow and pay back'' agreement with the
government.
   Costello complained in his memo that ``only minimal
consideration was given to executing the search warrant in a less
sensational manner.''
   He complained that no prior notice was given to Emerson's
attorneys, and added, ``To send 19 DCIS agents, one customs agent,
and several Missouri state troopers directly to the plant appears
to me to be an unwarranted show of force that invites sensational
treatment in the press.''
   Costello recommended that Carlucci ask Ms. Brown to ``develop a
program within the IG's office to train DoD investigators on
techniques to obtain evidence in the least forceful and sensational
manner'' _ a suggestion that was accepted.
   Explaining Carlucci's views on Costello's suggestion, Shea said
the secretary ``does not agree that searches should be reviewed or
approved by him, Mr. Taft or Mr. Costello which might be perceived
as interference in the conduct of criminal investigations.''
   But Shea said Carlucci has asked Ms. Brown to ``develop a policy
to ensure uniformity and consistency for searches on corporate
premises by all defense criminal investigative organizations.''
   Her suggestions, approved by Carlucci, require that:
   _Search warrant applications and affidavits are coordinated in
advance with appropriate legal advisers.
   _Clearances to use search warrants as an investigative technique
are approved at an appropriate level within the defense criminal
investigtive organizations.
   _Searches be conducted in a manner that will balance the need
for compliance with the need to ensure minimal disruption with
contractor operations.
   _Defense criminal investigative organizations receive adequate
training regarding this policy.

   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg has given birth to
a daughter, the first child for Ms. Kennedy and her husband Edwin
Schlossberg, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   The 7-pound, 12-ounce baby, Rose Kennedy Schlossberg, was born
at 3:30 a.m. Saturday at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center, said Nancy Tuckerman, a spokeswoman for Ms. Kennedy.
   She said the mother and baby, named for her 97-year-old
great-grandmother, are doing fine.
   Earlier this year, Ms. Kennedy, the daughter of the late
President Kennedy, graduated from the Columbia University School of
Law.
   It's the first grandchild for Ms. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis.
   Jonathan Weil, a spokesman for the hospital, repeatedly denied
to The Associated Press on Sunday and Monday that Ms. Schlossberg
had given birth or was even in the hospital.
   Ms. Kennedy, 30, and her husband, 43, an author and artist, were
married in 1986.

   What could be better than a rain dance
for the nation's driest city? How about a convention of the
International Carwash Association?
   ``A lot of people have the opinion that `If I wash my car, it's
going to rain.' So we'd love to have everybody go out and wash
their car and have it rain. That'd be wonderful,'' association
President Thomas J. Hoffman said with a laugh Monday.
   Last week, the National Weather Service said Nashville had
received only about 12 inches of rain so far this year, about 13.5
inches below normal. The agency rated the city the nation's driest
based on the difference between normal rainfall and the actual
level.
   ``There's a lot of joking about that with the customers at
home,'' said Jim Russell of Cincinnati, who owns Rainbow Car Wash.
``They'll say they want to be a hero today and get their car washed
so it'll rain.''
   The three-day convention was expected to draw up to 8,500 people
by the time it ends Wednesday. About 175 exhibitors set up aisles
and aisles of carwash equipment, ranging from huge car-scrubbing
brushes to newfangled wax treatments.
   Willard Scott, the jovial weatherman on NBC's ``Today Show,''
won enthusiastic applause during his keynote address when he
recounted a story of once doing commercials for a Washington, D.C.,
carwash.
   ``You never say partly cloudy and I always guaranteed ...
whoever paid the bills for the sponsorship that we'd always give
him a good shot and we'd never forecast rain when I did the
weather,'' Scott said.
   Jokes aside, Scott said he was concerned about the drought.
   ``My heart does go out to the farmers,'' said Scott, who has a
farm of his own in Virginia.
   Hoffman said the carwash industry, which lives and dies by the
weather, recognizes the problems arising from the extended drought
throughout much of the country and has taken measures to conserve
water.
   ``We have that question put to us continuously about the
drought. As far as water consumption, we are very, very visible to
the public,'' he said. ``But we use much, much less water than
someone washing their car at home.''
   Many carwashes filter and reuse water to conserve, Hoffman said.
   ``One of the things that we talk about here is how to conserve
water through high pressure pumps,'' he added. ``We conserve water
with what we call programmers to program the amount of water when
the water goes on the car.
   ``We have solenoids and control valves that put the proper
amount of water and the proper amount of solutions on so that we do
not waste, because this is definitely something we're as concerned
about as everybody else is,'' he said.
   And contrary to the popular belief that carwash owners usually
don't want rain, they really do like rain, said Hoffman, who owns
Hoffman Car Washes with 13 locations in Albany, N.Y.
   ``See, rain dirties cars. So a certain amount of rain is good,''
he said.
   ``But we realize, too, that other people have to live and we're
sure not praying for no rain,'' Hoffman said.
   ``We need rain just like everybody else. We have landscaping
around our places and it's all burning up,'' he said. ``And several
of our car washes are in communities where there's bans on
watering. Our lawns are messed up just the same as everybody
else's.''

   Nearly 150 guerrillas loyal to PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat were evacuated Tuesday from a devastated
refugee camp captured by Syrian-backed rivals in a bloody power
struggle.
   Palestine Liberation Organization leaders accused Damascus of
aiding and encouraging the dissident Fatah-Uprising faction to
crush Arafat's forces in Lebanon.
   They said that endangered a reconcilation effort between Arafat
and Syrian President Hafez Assad to end a 5-year-old feud over who
controls the Palestinian movement.
   The last group of Arafat loyalists emerged from Chatilla refugee
camp before dawn Tuesday, escorted by 30 Libyan soldiers.
   They were put in three trucks bound for Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut, but were stopped on the way by a leftist Lebanese militia
that controls the city. The militia later allowed the guerrillas to
be driven in ambulances to the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian camp on
the city's outskirts.
   A police spokesman said 13 guerrillas were hospitalized.
   The bodies of two Palestinians, a man and his fiancee, also were
carried from Chatilla on stretchers.
   Arafat's mainstream Fatah had battled the Syrian-backed
dissident Fatah-Uprising faction since May 1 for control of
Chatilla and a nearby shantytown, Bourj el-Barajneh. In all, 127
people were killed and 527 wounded.
   Fatah-Uprising guerrillas, led by Col. Saeed Mousa, overran
Chatilla in a fierce 13-hour battle Monday that leveled what was
left of the camp. Most of Arafat's 200 fighters then surrendered to
Syrian and Libyan officers.
   The PLO's executive committee on Monday blamed Assad for the
fighting.
   The London-based Mideast Mirror newsletter on Tuesday quoted
Salah Khalaf, Arafat's deputy, as saying the Beirut fighting
``constitutes a big setback for Syrian-Palestinian relations.'' He
said the Syrians were driving the PLO from Beirut under a plan
drawn up with U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, the
publication said.
   ``The plan on which Shultz and the Syrians agreed provides for
ridding west Beirut of weapons and fighters,'' the newsletter
quoted Khalaf as saying in a telephone interview from Tunis, where
the PLO has its headquarters.
   Khalaf claimed the plan was aimed at establishing a pro-Syrian
government in Lebanon, it reported.
   He also was quoted as accusing Damascus of seeking to undermine
Arafat and eliminate the PLO as a force under his leadership and of
predicting that inter-Palestinian feuding is likely to erupt in
south Lebanon.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has thousands of troops
enforcing security in west and south Beirut, but none made any
attempt to stop the fighting for Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh.
   Syrian soldiers on Tuesday confiscated weapons from Arafat
loyalists as they left Chatilla and searched them before allowing
them to board trucks for Sidon.
   The weapons were returned after they crossed the Syrians'
southern checkpoint on the Awali River just north of Sidon. The
Syrian escort returned to Beirut.
   The Popular Liberation Army, the leftist militia that controls
Sidon, refused to allow the five-vehicle Chatilla convoy into the
city.
   They blocked the highway north of Sidon with burning tires. The
PLA's leader, Mustafa Saad, said in a statement he feared if he let
the convoy through, Sidon would be flooded with other Palestinians
fleeing the Beirut fighting.
   Libyan officers met PLA officials to try to get the evacuees
into Sidon, where there are refugee camps. Police said the PLA
later allowed the guerrillas to be driven in ambulances to the Ein
el-Hilweh Palestinian camp.

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Rep. Thomas Reed pleaded innocent
to federal influence-peddling charges Tuesday with a whisper of the
noise that marked his attempt nearly five months ago to remove the
Confederate battle flag from Alabama's Capitol.
   While the state NAACP president drew a rowdy crowd and hordes of
reporters on Feb. 2 when he tried to scale a chain-link fence and
enter the Capitol grounds to take down the flag, Reed stood near
the bench and quietly answered a series of questions from U.S.
District Judge Myron Thompson.
   Reed, charged with bribery and extortion, declined comment
afterward, and his attorneys, George Beck of Montgomery and former
Lt. Gov. Bill Baxley, had little to add.
   ``We're not going to try the case in the press, we think it's
been tried in the press too much,'' said Beck. ``Tom pleaded not
guilty. We intend to prove he's not guilty.''
   Reed is accused of violating federal law by accepting at least
$15,000 in cash and restaurant equipment to try to secure the early
release of a convicted murderer from the state parole board.
   Baxley, a former state attorney general who unsuccessfully
prosecuted Reed on unrelated bribery charges more than 10 years
ago, said the legislator ``said it all when he said he was not
guilty.''
   ``What counts is what happens in court,'' Baxley added. He said
he had no qualms about defending a man he once prosecuted.
   Thompson gave Reed's attorneys 10 days to file papers
challenging the government's case and set the trial for Aug. 8.
   The legislator also has been indicted on related state felony
charges, with arraignment set in circuit court for July 27.
   Both state and federal grand juries charged that Reed, a member
of the Legislature's Joint Prison Committee, accepted at least
$10,000 in cash and $5,000 in restaurant equipment from an uncle of
convicted murderer Anthony Dennis Chesser.
   In return, Reed allegedly attempted to use his position to
persuade the parole board to give Chesser an earlier date for
parole consideration and a work-release assignment.
   Chesser, serving a 40-year sentence, initially was given an
earlier date for parole consideration at Reed's request, but the
parole board later revoked that change and refused Reed's request
to give Chesser a work-release assignment. Chesser remains behind
bars.
   On the federal charges, Reed could be sentenced to a maximum 55
years and fined $1.25 million if convicted. If convicted in state
court, he could be sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined
$10,000.
   Reed, among 14 black legislators charged with criminal
trespassing in the flag demonstration, remains free on bond. He has
said he will continue efforts to take down the flag, which he
considers a symbol of racism and oppression.

<HEAD>Monet's Painting of Wife Goes for $24 Million at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claude Monet's Impressionist painting of his wife
in a meadow became the third highest priced work at auction
Tuesday, going for $24.59 million to an anonymous telephone bidder,
Sotheby's said.
   The price for ``Dans La Prairie'' (``In the Meadow'') broke the
record for a Monet set 24 hours earlier at Christie's, which sold
his painting of a blue house for $6.55 million, also to an
anonymous telephone bidder.
   The two sales of Impressionist and modern paintings and
sculpture by the rival firms totaled nearly $123.5 million.
   Sotheby's also sold a Monet landscape for $2 million and set a
record price for Pierre Bonnard, whose painting of a woman in her
bath fetched $3.78 million.
   A picture of two women musicians by Henri Matisse sold for $2.83
million.
   Only one buyer of works realizing more than 1 million pounds
($1.72 million) was identified: Japan's Fujii Gallery paid $2.17
million for Pierre-Auguste Renoir's portrait of a young woman in a
yellow hat.
   ``The picture of his wife was Monet's most important work to
appear on the market for 20 years,'' said Sotheby's expert, Michel
Strauss.
   ``There was ferocious bidding which lasted for five minutes
between two people on the telephone and no one in the saleroom
appeared to be bidding while it was going on,'' said Fiona Ford,
Sotheby's spokeswoman.
   Auctioneer Julian Barran opened the bidding at $6.8 million
after Sotheby's had estimated the picture to be worth around $10.3
million.
   The highest auction prices have been paid for flower paintings
by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh.
   His ``Irises'' sold to an anonymous buyer at Sotheby's in New
York last November for $53.9 million. Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was
bought by a Japanese insurance company at Christie's in London in
March 1987 for $39.85 million.
   Monet, a Frenchman known as the father of Impressionism and the
greatest master of that style, painted his wife in 1876 when they
were living at Argenteuil near Paris.
   The summery picture depicts Camille in a white dress and hat,
with a parasol behind her, reading a book as she lies among tall
grass and wild flowers.
   The picture was sold by trustees of the estate of the late David
David-Weill, an art collector who bought it about 1938 in Paris
from the art dealers, Wildenstein.

<BYLINE>Rain Covers Parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin
^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms brought welcome rain to widespread
areas of Minnesota and Wisconsin on Tuesday and also scattered rain
in portions of the Plateau region, the Rockies and the Southern
Plains.
   Cooler weather prevailed from the Great Lakes to the Northern
and Middle Atlantic Coast states, but it was hot and humid along
the Central Gulf Coast and temperatures got up to around 100
degrees from South Dakota to eastern Kansas.
   Much of the area from northern Minnesota to northern and central
Wisconsin received at least a few tenths of an inch of rain.
   Park Falls, Wis., received three-quarters of an inch of rain in
the six hours ending at 1 p.m. CDT, while Wausau got 0.65 of an
inch and Duluth, Minn., recorded 0.57 of an inch in the same period.
   Severe thunderstorms east-central Minnesota with one-inch hail
and lightning set three structures on fire, while marble-sized hail
fell in west-central Wisconsin.
   Thunderstorms over the mountains west of Colorado Springs,
Colo., dropped four-tenths of an inch of rain in 15 minutes on
North French Creek late Tuesday morning. Winds gusted to 50 mph and
small hail was reported at Grandbury in north-central Texas.
   A flash flood watch was posted in parts of Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed over northeastern
Florida.
   It was mild in most of the West, but unseasonably cool weather
covered the Pacific Northwest. Snow was forecast in the Cascades of
Washington and Oregon at elevations as low as 4,000 to 6,000 feet.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures around the nation ranged from 49
degrees at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Wash., to 105
degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
the southern Plateau to portions of West Virginia, Virginia and
North Carolina. Rain is expected in the Rockies, the Great Plains,
the middle Mississippi Valley and lower Ohio Valley, with showers
and thunderstorms most numerous in eastern Colorado and along the
Missouri Valley from Missouri to Montana.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were forecast for
Florida, the central Gulf Coast, the Pacific Northwest and the
North Atlantic coastal states, with showers most numerous in
central Florida and New England.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 80s or 90s in most of the
nation. Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s from Minnesota
across the Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley to the Northern and
Middle Atlantic coastal states, and from western Montana to the
Pacific Northwest and along the Pacific Coast. Highs were forecast
to climb to around 100 degrees in portions of the lower Mississippi
Valley and up to 110 degrees in the central valleys of California
and across the desert Southwest.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Michel Rocard named a new, expanded Cabinet
on Tuesday with Socialists in all the key posts, similar to the
government that resigned two weeks ago.
   Rocard named four new ministers from centrist opposition
parties, bringing the total number to eight. It was unclear,
however, whether the appointments signaled a larger movement toward
cooperation between Socialists and centrists _something President
Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, had promised.
   Among the nine other new Cabinet members were a leading cancer
surgeon (Leon Schwarzenberg, deputy health minister); a well-known
historian (Alain Decaux, deputy overseas territories and
departments minister for French-speaking countries), and the leader
of an organization of the handicapped (Michel Gillibert, deputy
health minister for the handicapped).
   As expected, Rocard reappointed Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, Defense Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement and Interior Minister Pierre Joxe _ all
leading Socialists.
   Other top Socialist leaders reappointed from the first Cabinet
included Education Minister Lionel Jospin and Culture Minister Jack
Lang.
   The Socialist premier on Wednesday was to make his first major
policy address to the National Assembly since his appointment by
Mitterrand.
   Mitterrand was re-elected to a seven-year term on May 8,
defeating his conservative opponent, former Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Rocard's first Cabinet, named May 12, resigned after the
Socialists failed to win an absolute majority in the 577-seat
assembly in legislative elections on June 12.
   The Socialists won 276 seats, 13 short of a majority, leading to
speculation that Mitterand might try to form a coalition with some
members of the center-right grouping that holds 269 assembly seats.
   The new Cabinet included Labor Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson,
Foreign Trade Minister Jean-Marie Rausch, Family Affairs Minister
Helene Dorlhac and deputy Health Minister Theo Braun, all centrists.
   But statements from opposition leaders indicated the four were
acting on their own. No prominent centrist joined the new
government.
   Pierre Mehaignerie, leader of the Social Democratic Center, said
party member Rausch was ``acting on his own initiative'' and that
his actions ``put him on the margins of the party.''
   Mehaignerie said earlier his party was forming an
semi-autonomous group in the National Assembly that would support
or reject Socialist initiatives as it saw fit. He and other leaders
have been unwilling to participate as junior members in a coalition
with the Socialists.
   The Socialists have said they expect to pass their programs by
using tactical alliances with the centrists and the Communists, who
control 25 seats.
   The new Cabinet was expanded in size from 41 to 48 ministers and
included 24 non-Socialists. The previous Cabinet had 16
non-Socialists.
   There are six women in the new Cabinet, compared to four in the
previous one.
   As part of their overtures to the opposition, Socialist leaders
in the assembly on Tuesday allowed former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing of the center-right Union for French Democracy to win
re-election as head of the foreign affairs committee, one of the
six standing committee chairmanships.

<TEXT>
   China had a state budget deficit of 7.959 billion
yuan, or $2.15 billion, in 1987, according to a report made at the
National People's Congress Standing Committee Tuesday.
   That figure was up slightly from the 1986 deficit of 7 billion
yuan, or $1.89 billion.
   Chi Haibin, vice minister of finance, said state revenues were
236.89 billion yuan ($64.02 billion) and expenditures totaled
244.849 billion yuan ($66.17 billion) last year, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Ye Lin, vice chairman of the National People's Congress
Financial and Economic Committee, told the parliamentary body that
the deficit will remain about the same in 1988.
   He urged greater efforts to restructure the economy, raise
efficiency, adhere to the budget, avoid overspending and strengthen
administration of finance and tax incomes.
   About one-third of China's budget goes to subsidize prices and
finance state-run enterprises. Western economic experts say the
deficit figure would be at least twice that quoted by the Chinese
if China excluded from revenues those funds it receives from
foreign borrowing and treasury bond sales.

   Legislation requiring that fishing vessels
carry such safety equipment as life rafts and survival suits was
approved Tuesday by the House, capping a three-year effort by
Northwest lawmakers who called the measure a memorial to those who
have died at sea.
   ``This was an important first-step in making the industry
safer,'' said Robert Barry, whose son died when the fishing vessel
Western Sea sank off the Alaska coast in 1985.
   Barry, who lives in Washington, D.C., said the 70-year-old
Western Sea, which was registered out of Seattle, did not contain
life rafts, survival suits or an emergency locator when it went
down with six crewmen aboard.
   ``The crew of the Western Sea would have had a chance of
surviving if they had had such things as life rafts,'' said Barry.
``Without them, they didn't have a chance.''
   Barry and his wife, Peggy, lobbied hard for passage of the bill,
but added that more needs to be done including mandatory training
of fishing boat crews and mandatory Coast Guard inspections. The
bill now goes to the Senate.
   ``It seems strange to me that men and women have died because
they literally did not know how to open a pressurized life raft,''
said Mrs. Barry.
   The bill specifically requires that fishing boats carry radio
communications equipment including an emergency position-indicating
radio beacon. In addition, boats must carry life rafts or lifeboats
for each crew member and passenger and enough survival suits to
enable them to survive for at least four hours in the water.
   Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., a co-sponsor of the bill, said the
measure should ``assure the families who have lost their loved ones
that we have heard their anguish and listened to their plea that
others be spared.''
   ``The bill will not return loved ones lost at sea,'' Miller said
in a floor statement. ``But it is a lasting and fitting memorial to
the men and women, young and old, who did not return home from
fishing.''
   About 250 U.S. fishing boats sink each year, according to Coast
Guard statistics.
   Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., another bill co-sponsor, said the
death rate for fishermen is seven times the national average and
twice that among miners, the next most hazardous profession.
   ``An alarming number of people have been killed in accidents on
commercial fishing boats,'' said Lowry. ``We can't allow this
dangerous situation to continue.''
   Saying that about 80 fishermen die every year in accidents
involving commercial fishing boats, Lowry added the legislation
will ``go a long way toward preventing these tragic accidents.''
   Stripped from the bill was a provision that would have limited
the liability of boat owners in the case of accidents.
   The insurance provision, strongly opposed by the trial lawyers'
lobby and some consumer groups, had led to the defeat of the bill
on the House floor during the previous session of Congress. Miller
also said lawmakers had to overcome considerable skepticism from
the fishing industry over the need for the measure.
   ``The fishing industry has this macho aura and are very
skeptical of regulations,'' Miller said in an interview. ``They
feel they are masters of the sea.''

<HEAD>``Late Night'' Show Resumes Without Writers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Funny man David Letterman left his writers at
home but brought along his humor Tuesday as production of his show
resumed for the first time since a writers strike began four months
ago.
   The host of ``Late Night With David Letterman'' kept his
audience laughing through the hour-long show with repeated
references to the strike by the Writers Guild of America.
   ``We've got nothing but time to kill tonight,'' the chuckling,
gap-toothed comedian said at one point as the show was taped
Tuesday for broadcast early Wednesday morning.
   Last week, scriptwriters voted to continue their strike by a 75
percent to 25 percent margin.
   Normally, the show has 13 writers, including Letterman. The show
resumed with only Letterman, who wrote his own material, said Peter
Spivey, a spokesman for NBC.
   The show's head writer, Steve O'Donnell, had said the other
writers thought it was all right for the show to halt reruns and
resume production.
   And Letterman let his sympathies be known on the show as he
blamed the strike on producers, whom he repeatedly called
``money-grubbing scum'' and ``jerks.''
   ``I certainly have a bright future, don't I?'' he asked his
audience, which responded with laughter.
   Then he filled time talking about his $1,500 ringside seat at
Monday night's heavyweight bout in Atlantic City between Mike Tyson
and Michael Spinks and about his failure to impress friends at the
Indianapolis 500 when he said hello to actor Paul Newman, who all
but ignored him.
   ``And this strike may go on until Christmas, so I'm going to ask
every member of the staff, all of you in the band, if you can come
up with stories. As this unfolds, we'll call on you to help kill a
little time,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, he called on an associate producer in the show's
control room to play his accordion for the audience.
   ``Anything to kill a little time,'' he said as Pete Fatovich
performed ``Lady of Spain.''
   ``That's all we're really trying to accomplish is to eat up
valuable network time,'' Letterman said.
   He acted surprised when members of his staff cued him to stop
for commercials or let him know that the show had to move along.
   ``You're giving me time cues. Our biggest goal tonight is to
kill time,'' he quipped.
   His guests included comedian and Writers Guild member Billy
Crystal, actress Susan Sarandon and an inventor of odds and ends.
And although he announced at the start of the show that musician
Graham Parker would appear, he didn't.
   ``We ran out of time,'' Letterman said to applause.

   The nation's largest doctors' group Tuesday
reaffirmed its strong opposition to mercy killing, but rejected a
move to restrict its prestigious medical journal's publication of
articles about euthanasia.
   The American Medical Association's 420-member House of
Delegates, a legislative body representing 295,000 members,
approved a statement stressing its opposition ``to a physician
intentionally causing the death of a patient.''
   The delegates reiterated their stand in the wake of an uproar
over the publication of an article in January in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. The article by an unidentified doctor
described how he ended a cancer patient's life, at her request,
with a lethal dose of morphine.
   The story, called ``It's Over Debbie,'' touched off widespread
criticism of the journal for not publishing the author's name and
for not including a clear statement of the AMA's opposition to
mercy killing. The author had requested that his name be withheld.
   But the delegates rejected a proposal requiring the AMA to
``refrain from publishing articles which involve the taking of
human life'' without also printing the association's stand against
mercy killing.
   ``What is termed `active euthanasia' is a euphemism for the
intentional killing of a person; this is not part of the practice
of medicine, with or without the consent of the patient,'' states
the policy approved Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, delegates voted to call on the federal government
to end price supports for tobacco and help tobacco farmers begin
growing other products. Delegates postponed action until Wednesday
on a proposal to call for the doubling of the federal tobacco tax.
   The AMA's annual policy-making convention runs through Thursday.
   The delegates were scheduled to vote on a measure seeking to
shift the focus of the nation's war on drugs from drug traffickers
to users, but postponed action until Wednesday. A committee that
took testimony on the policy Tuesday recommended its adoption.
   The policy recommends that the federal government expand drug
abuse treatment programs, ease regulations to permit private
doctors to treat heroin abusers with methadone and beef up drug
education programs aimed at teen-agers. The policy also calls on
the president to appoint a high-ranking official to oversee the
government's drug policy and reduce rivalry among drug-fighting
agencies.
   The delegates are to vote Wednesday and Thursday on proposals to
revamp the Medicaid health insurance system for the poor, create a
new type of bedside hospital worker and battle the AIDS crisis.
   Before the delegates began voting on more than 300 policy
proposals, each was referred to a hearing committee. The committees
then heard comments from doctors and issued recommendations Tuesday.
   The committees recommended:
   _Approving a plan to overhaul Medicaid by setting national
eligibility standards and uniform payments for medical care. The
proposal, which would require federal government action, calls for
expanding Medicaid to provide coverage to an estimated 27 million
people living in poverty but not receiving government health-care
benefits. The move would cost an estimated $24 billion at 1988
spending levels.
   _Developing an AMA pilot project to test the idea of creating a
new class of hospital bedside worker, called a ``registered care
technologist,'' in an effort to offset the nursing shortage.
   These workers would handle such chores as bathing patients,
taking vital signs and changing bandages. The committee recommended
that the trustees work with the American Nurses' Association
officials, which opposes the plan.
   _Approving a series of policies for slowing the spread of AIDS,
including a recommendation that states seriously consider programs
to trace the sexual partners of all AIDS victims. The policies also
call for extending anti-discrimination laws to include AIDS victims.
   The committee recommendation also called for approval of a
policy supporting mandatory testing of all prison inmates for the
AIDS virus. But it urged the AMA's governing board of trustees to
reevaluate the policy over the next six months.
   Also Tuesday, the delegates had been scheduled to vote on a
proposal to call on state and federal governments to limit the
amount of money awarded in product liability lawsuits. The vote was
postponed until Wednesday.
   According to a report prepared by AMA trustees, biomedical
companies have slowed development of new vaccines, drugs and other
``potentially life-saving technologies'' because of the fear of
litigation.

<HEAD>Four Manigat Supporters Arrested Night Of Coup Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Four supporters of deposed
President Leslie Manigat who were arrested the night of the June
19-20 coup, including three Americans, were released on Tuesday,
the Ministry of Information announced.
   The three U.S. citizens were identified as Robert Benodin,
Frantz Jean-Louis and Jean Bogart. The fourth man, Harry Carrenard,
was identified as a Haitian-Canadian with double nationality. No
home towns were provided.
   The men were handed over to representatives of their embassies
at police headquarters in Port-au-Prince.
   The four, and an estimated 15 others, had been arrested at the
Presidential Residence.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said in a telephone
conversation with The Associated Press that the American Privacy
Act kept him from disclosing the whereabouts of the released
Americans, but he did not deny they probably already have left the
country.
   Carrenard, a former minister of social affairs here, said in an
interview broadcast over Radio Haiti-Inter that despite his double
nationality he considers himself a Haitian citizen.
   ``Politics is a game,'' he said. ``You win or you lose. We have
lost. We hope the country has not lost too much.''
   In another interview, over state-run television, Carrenard said
he had been well treated.
   A Canadian Embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was ``under the impression that he (Carrenard)
will not be able to remain in the country.''
   The U.S. Embassy said in a statement following the release of
the four that it was still concerned about the fate of the others
arrested, including former Minister of Information Roger Savain and
his son Roger Jr., and Lionel Desgranges, Manigat's chief of staff.
   Local radio reports said Desgranges' two children took refuge in
the Venezuelan Embassy, but the Venezuelan ambassador denied this.
   Haiti-Inter said Yvon Simeon, a Manigat militant; Pierre Rigaud,
senior adviser to Manigat, and Mireille Benodin, wife of Benodin
and secretary to Milandree Manigat, the deposed president's wife,
were released last week.
   Lite said the U.S. Embassy received assurances last week from
the government that the other prisoners would be let go by the end
of this week.
   The communique announcing the release of the four on Tuesday was
signed by Minister of Information Col. Acedius St. Louis.
   Manigat, president of Haiti for 130 days, was overthrown on the
night of June 19 in a bloodless coup led by the military. Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy named himself president of a new military government
the following morning.
   The president had fired Namphy for insubordination over the
transfer of Col. Jean-Claude Paul from commander of Dessalines
Battalion to an administrative post.
   Namphy had been president of the National Council of Government
which ruled Haiti from the fall of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in
February l986 until Manigat's inauguration in February l988.
   Manigat and his wife and child were flown out of Haiti and into
exile June 21.

   An American has been united with an
18-year-old Amerasian son he fathered during the Vietnam War and
whom he had never seen, the father said Tuesday.
   Joseph Crotty said he planned to take his son, Khuc Thua Si, to
the United States, where they would live together.
   ``We have air tickets confirmed for Friday,'' said Crotty, 62,
of Redding, Calif. ``It's quite emotional.''
   Crotty, a retired U.S. Navy officer, and his son arrived Monday
in Bangkok, where Si was to spend a few days doing necessary
paperwork before traveling to the United States.
   On June 20, Crotty and three other parents flew to Ho Chi Minh
City, formerly known as Saigon, hoping to return with their
Amerasian offspring.
   The three others parents are West Anderson of Poulsbo, Wash.;
Verdun Andrus of San Diego, Calif., and Nam Small, the Vietnamese
wife of John Small of Westbrook, Maine.
   Anderson and Mrs. Small returned to the United States Tuesday,
apparently unable to complete necessary formalities to take their
children out of Vietnam.
   Mrs. Small's son, Nguyen Ngoc Linh, 16, lives in Can Tho, south
of Ho Chi Minh City.
   Anderson, 38, took his Vietnamese wife to the United States when
he left Vietnam during the war years, but left behind their
daughter, Nguyen Thi Lang, now 16, in Qui Nhon, north of Ho Chi
Minh City.
   Andrus has extended his stay in Ho Chi Minh City to try to leave
with his 14-year-old son, Vo Thi Tham.
   The Vietnamese government has said that all of the country's
Amerasians should be resettled in the United States and has
organized a departure program for them. It has also allowed smaller
groups of Amerasians to leave on an informal basis.
   Crotty left Vietnam in August 1969, leaving behind his pregnant
housekeeper, Pham Thi Tam. He said Si was very concerned about his
mother, a street sweeper who recently suffered a heart attack.
   `It's going to be more difficult as we get along without the
interpreters,'' Crotty said, noting that his son speaks little
English.
   Immediate plans for Si include an American education, Crotty
added. In Vietnam, Si attended nine years of school and took on
various manual labor jobs in Danang, where he lived.

   Vice President George Bush said
Tuesday that AIDS victims should have federal protection from
discrimination on the job, in schools and elsewhere.
   ``I think it is needed,'' Bush said, embracing the key _ and
most controversial _ recommendation of President Reagan's AIDS
commission before Reagan himself had taken a position.
   ``I think it is important to do a lot to lay to rest some of the
fears. There is a lot of misunderstanding,'' Bush said.
   The commission delivered its final report to the White House on
Monday, calling for an executive order or new federal laws to
prevent AIDS discrimination.
   Reagan has not taken a stand on the issue, which has polarized
some communities, particularly as parents grapple with whether to
send their children to classes attended by AIDS victims.
   Bush said Reagan ``did the right thing'' by withholding
judgment. ``How can the White House be asked to take an instant
position?'' he asked.
   When it was pointed out that Bush, himself, was doing just that,
the vice president said Reagan ``just saw this thing yesterday.
He's not running for president. Maybe he wasn't asked the question,
either.''
   Bush, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, said
``I've got a different role here. I want to say what I think.''
   The vice president endorsed the anti-discrimination proposal on
a trip to San Francisco, a city whose homosexual population has
been ravaged by AIDS.
   Bush spent part of the flight westward reading the AIDS
commission's report and then went to the rear cabin to outline his
views to reporters.
   He said protection from discrimination against carriers of the
AIDS virus should not be seen as a gay rights issue, although
homosexuals are the group hardest hit.
   ``This is a national health problem. We're talking about
children, innocent victims,'' he said.
   Bush said anti-discrimination policy should apply to everyone
carrying the AIDS virus and should not be left to the states
because ``there's some national federal responsibility.''
   The vice president said during his California trip on Tuesday
that he was not worried about a Gallup Poll for the Times Mirror
Corp., released Monday, that shows him running 13 points behind
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   ``I don't make too much of it,'' Bush said, adding that polls
had shown him trailing before the New Hampshire primary, which he
won handily. ``I look at it as something that can be taken care of.
   ``I like to come back. I think I'm going to win,'' he said.
   The vice president flew to northern California to tour NASA's
Ames Research Center and see its supercomputer, which can perform
250 million calculations a second.
   During a news conference in a cavernous wind tunnel, Bush
acknowledged that ``there will be some that differ with _ argue
with one part or another'' of the commission's report. ``I might be
(opposed). I haven't read the entire report ... There will be
different voices.'' He said he had no idea of penalties for people
guilty of discrimination.
   On a related subject Bush voiced strong opposition to the
distribution of free needles to drug addicts, a step taken in some
instances to curb the spread of AIDS. ``It just offends me, that
concept of encouraging people to take shots of heroin or whatever
kind of shots,'' Bush said.
   On another subject Bush clarified that he was not opposed to
prison furloughs for all drug dealers. ``I'm against particularly
those who kill policemen and are kingpin narcotics types,'' he said.
   After a luncheon at the estate of industrialist David Packard,
Bush was attending a fund-raising dinner in San Francisco.
   Bush said he was moved by what he heard from James D. Watkins, a
retired admiral who is the AIDS commission's chairman, ``about the
need for people in the workplace to be able to come forward,
especially if the commission report endorses testing (for AIDS) and
I think it does.
   ``They're not going to come forward if they think they're going
to be thrown out of their jobs,'' Bush said.
   He repeatedly couched his discussion of AIDS discrimination in
terms of its effect on children.
   ``I would hate if a kid of mine got a blood transfusion, (if) my
grandson had AIDS, and the community discriminated against that
child, innocent child, particularly when the report concludes and
(Surgeon General C. Everett) Koop, I'm sure would agree, that AIDS
is not _ can't be transmitted in ways that some had feared.''
   Asked if an executive order or law would strip parents of
healthy children of their right to protect their young, Bush said,
``I think the parents of an innocent child (with AIDS) have the
right, too, and that is that that child is not the victim of
invidious discrimination.''
   He said he would change his views if it can be shown that AIDS
can be communicated ``in casual ways.''
   He said the AIDS commission's report ``will do a lot to lay to
rest some of the fears about this disease, a lot of
misunderstanding.''
   ``They've concluded there is a danger of discrimination against
little kids that can't go to a school, and the reason they can't go
there is people think that they can communicate the disease, and
the facts show that that doesn't happen,'' the vice president said.
   He said that based on advice from the National Institutes of
Health, the federal government does not need to increase spending
on AIDS research.
   ``We have about the proper level of funding,'' he said. ``It's
close to $1 billion.''
   Before returning to Washington on Wednesday, Bush is to deliver
a foreign policy address before the World Affairs Council. He also
is to stop in Appleton, Wis., on Wednesday afternoon to view
drought damage affecting the nation's farmlands.

   The drought has drained wells in Nebraska and sizzling
temperatures in Minnesota were blamed for a shortage of blood
donors, but rumors of rain sent corn and soybean futures plummeting
Tuesday in a frenzied session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The plunge was based on concerns that rain may fall across the
Midwest and bring at least some relief to drought-stricken crops.
   ``That dirty word was being heard on the floor today, r-a-i-n.
Not a lot, just a little bit, but that's all it takes to scare
anybody,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Corn prices dropped the limit set by the Board of Trade, 15
cents a bushel from Monday, when they closed up the limit. Soybeans
also fell the 45-cents-a-bushel limit.
   Officials in parched communities in the Midwest and Southeast,
the regions hit hardest, fretted over weekend forecasts and debated
canceling Fourth of July fireworks for fear that sparks could start
timber and brush fires. Independence, Mo., opted for a laser light
show instead.
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson signed an executive order
banning private fireworks displays, open fires and even sparklers.
Under the ban, local governments and the state may make exceptions
where conditions allow. Also exempted will be community fireworks
displays, but only where adequate fire prevention measures are
taken.
   Meanwhile, the federal government froze grain inventories in
three hard-hit counties in North Dakota. And Iowa Gov. Terry
Branstad and Agriculture Secretary Dale Cochran announced a joint
effort to get up to $7 billion in drought relief.
   Branstad, a Republican, and Cochran, a Democrat, said they'll go
to Washington to seek changes in federal legislation allowing
farmers to keep deficiency payments they've already gotten. No date
has been set for the trip, aides said.
   The American Soybean Association began a campaign for federal
help, saying soybean farmers should get whatever relief is approved
for other commodity producers and should have more flexibility in
planting and marketing soybeans.
   First vice president James Lee Adams said in a telephone news
conference from St. Louis that the nation's crop could be as small
as 1.2 billion bushels if there is no significant rain until
August, down from more than 1.9 billion bushels last year.
   The Coast Guard tightened restrictions on barge traffic on the
Lower Mississippi because of the continued grounding of towboats.
Northbound towboats will be limited to 20 barges, only 12 of which
can be loaded, said Cmdr. Michael Donohoe of the Memphis district.
Last week, the Guard imposed a limit of 25 barges per tow, of which
16 could be loaded.
   Limits for southbound towboats remained unchanged at 20 barges,
all of which can be loaded.
   Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources has refused to let
farmers withdraw water from some highly stressed trout streams
until water levels rise, said Max Johnson, a fish manager at Antigo.
   ``It puts us in a very difficult position,'' he said. ``On the
one hand, the governor is saying give them water. On the other
hand, we can't. It's an impossible position.''
   Johnson estimated that 40 percent to 60 percent of the trout in
streams in his area have died because of the drought. He said the
estimate probably applies to much of Wisconsin.
   Nebraska officials say water supplies are marginal in 30 to 50
towns in the eastern part of the state. The towns of Dawson and
Table Rock began rationing water last week, said Jack Daniel of
Nebraska's Department of Health.
   In normally temperate Minneapolis and St. Paul, two weeks of
temperatures in the mid-90s have kept donors away from Red Cross
centers and bloodmobiles, said Robert Bowman, medical director of
the St. Paul Regional Red Cross Blood Services.
   ``It's clearly the worst I've seen this early,'' Bowman said.
``The part that worries me is that we're already in the shape we
didn't expect to be in until midsummer.''
   In addition to the unusually high number of no-shows, those who
do come in are being rejected for physical reasons that may be
weather-related, such as red blood cell concentrations diluted by
drinking excess fluids, said Bowman.
   The grain inventory freeze in three North Dakota counties was an
effort to ensure there will be feed for livestock farmers, said
Collyn Peterson, a deputy director for the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service field office in Kansas City,
Mo.
   In Logan County in south-central North Dakota, row crops are 90
percent wiped out, by county agriculture agent Roger Martin's
estimate. He also predicted cattlemen would continue to sell off
livestock as feed grain becomes increasingly scarce.
   ``People are waiting till after the Fourth,'' he said. ``After
the Fourth they're going to admit defeat.''
   Several years of below-average rainfall in North Carolina's
mountains are beginning to take their toll, and older trees could
die by summer's end as they draw off their reserves, forestry
experts said.
   ``The younger trees are the most stressed,'' said Tim Boone, a
Christmas tree grower in Mitchell County. ``We usually can count on
snow in the winter and rain in the spring before we transplant. But
we've had no spring rainfall.''
   Arizona's baking temperatures have caused pollen monitors in the
Pima County Health Department to note that marijuana illegally
grown in the area has matured about three weeks early.
   Marijuana plants shed up to 500 million pollen grains in a
season, and could be the leading type of pollen in the area for
several weeks, said Mark Sneller, director of the office of pollen
and mold. ``It will raise our overall pollen count and when we get
some rain, our Bermuda grass pollen will kick in. We could have a
rough August.''
   Law enforcement officers in Kentucky say the drought appears to
affecting marijuana plants, the state's No. 1 cash crop, and
driving up prices. The plants require a lot of water, officials
said.
   Detective Charles Forshee of the Warren County Sheriff's Office
said deputies paid $1,600 for a pound of marijuana in a recent
undercover operation, double the normal price, he said.

<HEAD>Saddam Hussein Says Iran On Ropes, Iran Claims Iraqi Attack
Repulsed</HEAD>

   Iran on Tuesday claimed its forces killed
or wounded thousands of Iraqi troops who tried to recapture
strategic peaks in northern Iraq, and both sides reported air
strikes against each other's positions.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, speaking in Baghdad, boasted his
army has 50 divisions totaling nearly 1 million men, and that after
three battlefield defeats the Iranians are on the ropes.
   In Kuwait, Richard Murphy, a U.S. assistant secretary of state,
said Washington will not resume normal relations with Iran until it
agrees to end the Persian Gulf war with Iraq and quits terrorism.
   Murphy, on an eight-nation tour of the gulf, held talks with
Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad Abdullah
Al-Sabah.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a
Revolutionary Guards communique as saying the Iranians mauled three
special forces and commando brigades in heavy fighting in Kurdistan
on Monday.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said the fighting centered around
the Iranian-held Shakh-Shemiran range near Lake Darbandikhan, Iraqi
territory seized months ago.
   The news agency also claimed the Iranians shot down an Iraqi
fighter-bomber.
   Baghdad denied losing any planes in heavy air activity Monday.
It reported its warplanes and helicopter gunships flew 219 combat
missions Tuesday, most of them apparently in the northern sector of
the 730-mile battlefront.
   IRNA said Iranian fighter-bombers attacked Iraqi positions in
the northern warfront around Sulaimaniyeh and Darbandikhan Tuesday.
   The Iraqis, bolstered by three victories over Iran in nine weeks
in a dramatic turnaround in the nearly 8-year-old war, have been
pressing the Iranians in the north in recent weeks.
   After driving the Iranians out of three of their bridgeheads on
Iraqi soil in the south in Majnoon, Salamcheh and the Faw
Peninsula, the Iraqis have been trying hard to push the Iranians
out of Kurdistan.
   They claim to have retaken in recent fighting several key peaks
that dominate the region.
   In Baghdad, Hussein told a ceremony awarding medals for valor to
air force pilots: ``The day will come when the rulers of Iran will
find no one to fight for them, and that day is not far away.
   ``Iraq hopes that the eighth year of the war will be the last
and that the Iranian rulers will come to their senses,'' the
official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, quoted
Hussein as saying.
   INA said the president disclosed that in the Iraqis' latest
offensive to recapture the oil-rich Majnoon islands in the Howeizah
marshes north of Basra last Sunday, his forces thrust 19 miles into
western Iran before withdrawing.
   Western military analysts believe Iran is regrouping its forces
after its defeats and plans to strike back.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, named commander-in-chief
by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in a military shakeup, has declared
his forces will ``respond at the appropriate time'' for the
setbacks.
   Independent verification of battle claims by the opposing sides
is rarely possible, since neither as a rule allows foreign
correspondents into war zones.

<HEAD>Church Leader Vows to Defy Government Crackdowns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-apartheid church
leader vowed Tuesday that religious organizations would disobey
government laws and regulations that they consider unjust.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane said the South African Council of
Churches, which he heads, already has defied government orders to
submit copies of church publications for review.
   ``On the basis of the practice and constitution of this
government, we are compelled to regard it as illegitimate and are
thus not obliged to obey its unjust laws,'' Chikane said.
   During a speech at the group's national conference, Chikane
called on Western nations to impose additional economic sanctions
against South Africa. He said sanctions were ``one of the most
effective non-violent ways to force the government to the
negotiating table.''
   It is illegal under emergency regulations to advocate sanctions.
   The church council, which began its five-day conference at St.
Barnabas College on Monday, represents all major Protestant sects
in South Africa except the white branch of the Dutch Reformed
Church, the denomination of most government officials.
   Chikane and other church leaders have vowed to take the lead in
anti-apartheid activities following government crackdowns against
most opposition groups.
   ``The government has confirmed its commitment to violence as the
way of continuing to govern the majority of people against their
will,'' he said. ``Attacks have been particularly directed against
the SACC, some church leaders ... and other ecumenical
organizations.''
   In the recent crackdowns, the government has not placed
restrictions on anti-apartheid church leaders such as Chikane and
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But President P.W. Botha has
harshly criticized the men and warned them to refrain from
political activities.
   Chikane said the government has shown little interest in
improving the standard of living among blacks and that the council
of churches and its members have been providing services he
believed should be government responsibilities.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   In other developments Tuesday, police said they arrested 66
blacks from two opposing groups that were fighting in a township
outside the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg. Police did not
identify the two factions or the nature of the conflict, saying
only that three men were injured.
   But local residents said the battle, which lasted from Saturday
until Monday, involved the United Democratic Front, the nation's
largest anti-apartheid coalition, and Inkatha, a political
organization. More than 500 blacks have been killed in fighting
between the two groups in the past 18 months.

   A partially deaf boy whose identity has
been a mystery since he was found roaming the streets last year was
reunited Tuesday with his mother after he was shown a picture of
her and began crying, authorities said.
   Authorities said it would take three days to confirm through
medical records that the little boy they called Sabath actually is
9-year-old Jose de Jesus Garcia Aguilera. But they said there he
did indeed appear to have found his mother.
   ``Good,'' said a reticent Micaela Aguilera de Garcia when asked
how it felt to see her son, who is nicknamed Chuy, for the first
time since last October. She repeatedly hugged her teary-eyed boy.
   Ms. Aguilera, 32, a maid in the Gulf Coast port of Tampico, said
her son went to Monterrey, Mexico, last October to see his father,
Salomon Garcia Betancourt, and ran away from there.
   The boy was found wandering the streets of Ciudad Juarez, a
Mexican border town, in early November. Mexican authorities
eventually contacted their United States counterparts because they
thought the boy might be American.
   At the first reunion, where reporters were not present, Chuy was
shown pictures of his mother and grandmother, said Olivia Espinoza
Bermudez, director of the Mexican child welfare agency in Juarez.
   ``We showed the picture to Sabath ... and right away he started
mentioning that was his mother,'' she said, adding that he began
crying. Then, when his mother was allowed in the room, ``he just
ran and saw her and cried, but he was happy,'' Mrs. Bermudez said.
   ``He's very excited, and he has already packed his things and is
ready to go,'' she said.
   Tuesday night, reporters watched as the two communicated in an
impromptu sign language.
   ``Why do I think he's my son?'' Ms. Aguilera said. ``Because of
his scars _ on his leg, his head and his left arm.''
   She pointed to a scar below Chuy's left knee and said it was
from a dog bite. ``Bad dog,'' she said to Chuy in English. ``Bad
dog,'' the boy answered back in a deep voice.
   The two laughed and hugged tightly.
   The boy, who speaks only a few words and communicates primarily
by gestures and drawings, had been staying at the Juarez center for
the Development of the Integrated Family, a Mexican federal
child-welfare agency.
   Authorities at the center became intrigued when they noticed the
boy seemed to prefer American food and cartoon characters, so they
called in their American counterparts at the Texas Department of
Human Services. They and the FBI publicized the boy's case and
tried to find his origins.
   Last week, when Juarez authorities were notified that Ms.
Aguilera was missing a son matching the description of the boy in
Juarez, the El Paso Times sent a reporter and photographer to the
Gulf port to track her down.
   They did and showed her a picture of the boy known as Sabath.
She and other relatives confirmed that Sabath was one of her five
children. The Times chartered a flight to the El Paso area Tuesday
to reunite the mother and child.
   Ms. Aguilera said she left her husband in June 1987. She and her
children went to live with her mother in Tampico.

   Rookie Greyhound bus driver Lita Martin got
lost on a trip from Fresno to San Francisco Monday and at one point
had to ask passengers for directions.
   It was her third day on the job and her first on the 20-stop
route from Fresno. A Greyhound official in Dallas said she only
``graduated from driving school last week.''
   Although one passenger insisted Martin got lost four times, the
bus driver and Greyhound officials said it only happened once.
   Greyhound's slogan, ``Take the bus and leave the driving to
us,'' took on new meaning when Martin asked passengers how to find
the depot in Livermore, a stop along the route, said passenger
Susan Parker, a 24-year-old waitress.
   Later, Parker said, the driver ``got lost finding the bus
station in Hayward, San Leandro and Oakland. Most of the passengers
didn't seem to mind. They enjoyed giving her directions. But I was
ready to scream.''
   In Dallas, Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said Martin became
lost only in Merced, 50 miles northwest of Fresno. He said
passengers gladly gave her directions to the terminal there.
   Martin also spent some time in Modesto clarifying route stops
with an agent there, Gravley said. She arrived in San Francisco 65
minutes late, he said.
   ``Maybe she doesn't have as much confidence as an old-timer, but
we think she's a good driver,'' he said. ``Anybody can make a
mistake their first day on the job.''

   Fighting has increased around the
Afghan capital of Kabul, where Soviet airpower last week suffered
its worst single blow of the war, Western diplomatic sources said
Tuesday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said communist
forces pulled back from Kabul's outermost security ring to
consolidate defenses against Islamic guerrillas who have been
penetrating in small units.
   Sources quoted other diplomats in Kabul as saying nine rockets,
presumably fired by guerrillas, slammed into the city in a
seven-day span ending Monday.
   They said various reports indicate that hundreds of dead or
wounded Afghan and Soviet troops arrived in the city from battles
around the country.
   Kabul radio, monitored in London, said Tuesday that 18 men,
women and children were killed on Monday when their vehicle hit a
land mine planted by ``extremists'' along the Tokham-Jalalabad road
in eastern Afghanistan.
   It said the vehicle was taking the 18 from Jalalabad to villages
in Sorkhdewar region.
   One rebel rocket on Friday may have touched off an explosion
that destroyed an ammunition dump and eight Soviet SU-25
fighter-bombers at Kabul airport, the sources said.
   Western diplomats estimated the aircraft cost about $70 million,
making it the worst single-day air loss since the Soviets
intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.
   Diplomats said the scale of fighting around Kabul is increasing,
especially to the east and west.
   The Soviets and the Marxist Afghan government are said to be
increasingly nervous over the situation in Wardak province, just
west of the capital, where insurgents claim to have taken the
capital of Maidan Shahr.
   The fall of Wardak province would open the free flow of
guerrillas and their equipment to the Paghman heights overlooking
western Kabul.
   The guerrillas also claimed to have taken Kalat, provincial
capital of southeastern Zabul province, on June 16. But diplomatic
sources said Tuesday that local citizens asked the guerrillas to
leave to spare Kalat from retaliatory bombardments by troops.
   In neighboring Kandahar province, guerrillas have cornered
Afghan and remaining Soviet troops at the airport of the provincial
capital, according to combined sources.
   The guerrillas asked civilians to evacuate the area in
preparation for increased attacks on garrisons there, the sources
said.
   Despite guerrilla advances, diplomats said the Soviet pullout
under terms of a U.N.-sponsored Geneva agreement appears to moving
on or ahead of schedule.
   Soviet officials claim about 25 percent of their 100,000-strong
contingent have crossed the Oxus River into home territory in the
first six weeks of the pullout that began in May. They promised to
remove 50 percent of their troops by Aug. 15.
   Undersecretary-General Diego Cordovez, the mediator of the U.N.
accords, said Tuesday he will review alleged violations of the
10-week-old agreement during official talks in the area.
   The accords are being implemented ``as satisfactorily as one can
expect under the circumstances,'' Cordovez told reporters on the
eve of a trip to Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Afghanistan and Pakistan have lodged nearly 100 complaints with
his office, including Afghan charges that Pakistan is continuing to
supply the guerrillas, Cordovez said.

<HEAD>Population Study Sees High Rate of African Infant Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every other person who dies in Africa is a
child less than five years old, and early in the 21st century
nearly half of all the children who die worldwide will be African,
according to U.N. figures.
   New data from the U.N. Population Division indicate that a
child's chance of surviving to adulthood often depends on where the
child is born.
   About 15 million children died each year from 1980-85, and 98
percent of those deaths were in underdeveloped countries. Most were
in South Asia, but by 2025, most will be in Africa, the study says.
   A child born in a developing country is, on the average, seven
times more likely to die before reaching five than a child in the
industrialized nations.
   In the countries with the worst infant and child mortality
rates, such as Afghanistan, Mali or Sierra Leone, a child is 40
times more likely to die than in a northern European country.
   The U.N. data, published this month in ``Mortality of Children
Under Age 5 _World Estimates and Projections, 1950-2025,'' do
contain signs of hope:
   _The mortality rate under age 5 declined by more than half
worldwide in the last 30 years, from 240 per thousand in 1950-55 to
118 per thousand in 1980-85.
   _East Asia has experienced the most rapid child mortality
decline of any region, about 80 percent since 1950 from 248 per
thousand to 50 per thousand.
   _China reduced child mortality from 266 per thousand to 55 per
thousand in the last 30 years.
   _The Soviet Union lowered child mortality from 102 per thousand
to 31 per thousand in 30 years, a reduction of almost 70 percent.
   _North America lowered its child mortality rates over 30 years
from 34 per thousand to 13 per thousand, a reduction of 61 percent.
   Mortality figures vary widely among underdeveloped regions.
   Africa has the highest death rate, at 182 per thousand in
1980-85, followed by South Asia at 157 per thousand; Latin America
at 88 per thousand; the developing countries of Oceania at 81 per
thousand, and the developing countries of East Asia at 53 per
thousand.
   Fertility and mortality rates are expected to decline in all
regions and the number of deaths are expected to decline everywhere
except in Africa.
   In Africa, the high fertility rate and the fact that a large
part of the population is of child-bearing age are expected to
offset declining mortality rates, causing increasing numbers of
deaths among children.
   By the years 2020 to 2025, nearly half of all infant and child
deaths worldwide are expected to be in Africa, the study concluded.
   The mortality study was conducted by the Population Division of
the U.N. Department of International Economic and Social Affairs,
with the support of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

<HEAD>Revival of Boycott Against Nestle Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. consumer activists Tuesday accused the
Nestle food conglomerate of breaking promises to stop promoting
infant formula in the Third World and threatened to revive a
seven-year boycott of the company's products that ended in 1984.
   Douglas A. Johnson, chairman for Action for Corporate
Accountability said the group objects to distribution of free
formula through maternity hospitals as a promotional tactic that
``effectively undermines breastfeeding ... (and) creates the
impression that health professionals recommend it.''
   ``Once bottle feeding starts, breastmilk begins to dry up,'' he
added. ``When mother and baby leave the hospital there is a
physical need to buy more formula - both mother and baby are hooked
(addicted).''
   But ``Nestle has refused to abide by these unequivocal
statements to end its supplies program, breaking the promise it
made in 1984,'' Johnson said.
   ACA, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is the successor of groups
that organized boycott activities against Nestle, the Swiss-based
global food distributor, from 1977-84 in the United States and nine
other countries.
   The groups halted the boycott after Nestle agreed to comply with
the World Health Organization Code and promised a clarification
covering donation of formula to institutions.
   Johnson estimated that the 10-nation boycott had cost the
multinational company $3 billion.
   ACA also warned a second firm, American Home Products Co.,
against alleged promotion of formula for newborns, on grounds it
undermines the traditional _ and healthier _ practice of
breastfeeding.
   ``AHP and other U.S., Japanese and European formula
manufacturers have hidden in the shadow of Nestle, but are no less
guilty of marketing practices which endanger infant health,''
Janice Mantell, executive director of ACA told a news conference.
   ``We call upon Nestle to produce a plan, detailing how and when
it will stop its practice of pushing free supplies in maternity
wards and hospitals,'' Ms. Mantell said. ``If this plan is not
available by Oct. 4, the fourth anniversary date of the end of the
first boycott, the Nestle boycott will be renewed at that time.''
   She added a warning to American Home Products ``to develop a
detailed and reasonable code implementation plan by the same date''
or it ``will also be the target of a public pressure campaign.''
   Spokespeople for both Nestle and AHP rejected the accusations
and said they were complying with the World Health Organization and
individual national codes.
   Dr. Thad Jackson, Washington spokesman for the Nestle parent
firm in Switzerland, said ``We totally reject either that we're in
violation of the WHO code or of our agreement. We are industry
leaders in supporting the code, which is the standard by which we
market our products in the Third World.''
   The code permits donations or concessionary sales of formula for
distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes and says it
may not be used for sales promotion. Jackson said Nestle sends free
supplies only to hospitals requesting it in writing and closely
monitors against excessive requests.
   AHP spokeswoman Carol Emerling, reached by telephone at her New
York office, called the accusation against her firm ``not
well-grounded'' since ``we comply with the WHO code in all
countries when full compliance is relevant, or 100 percent with the
codes of countries that have their own.''

   Despite assurances by then-Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger that there were few problems, 90 percent of the
defense contractors surveyed in a Pentagon study last year were
found to be sloppy in handling secrets.
   The study was done by the Defense Investigative Service but was
withheld from Congress by Weinberger because he didn't like the
conclusions of the report, according to sources who spoke Monday on
condition they not be named.
   The report dealt with the way Pentagon contractors handle highly
classified information known as ``special access programs.''
   It was ordered by Congress in 1986 after an investigation by a
House subcommitee into allegations that Lockheed, a major defense
contractor, couldn't find a number of classified documents on its
highly secret ``stealth'' airplane program.

   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops
decided to revamp their stand on fighting AIDS to quell a division
within the church, but stopped short of condemning a paper that
tolerates teaching about condoms.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops concluded Monday by
unanimously approving a decision to appoint a committee to draft a
new AIDS paper. The updated document would be drawn in closer
consultation with the Vatican and acceptable to the entire
conference, church leaders said after a closed session at St.
John's University.
   ``The division among ourselves, the teachers, is reflected among
the people,'' said a statement released by Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin of Chicago, who made the motion for the new paper. ``We
cannot allow it to continue festering. Our unity must be restored
so we can get on with our business.''

big brokerage and a Hong Kong businessman who allegedly reaped $19
million in illicit profits.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint filed
Monday accused Stephen Wang Jr., a junior analyst in a training
program at Morgan Stanley & Co., of giving secrets about impending
corporate takeovers to Fred C. Lee, a client with homes in Hong
Kong and McLean, Va., a swank Washington suburb.
   ``From at least July 1987 through at least April 1988, Lee

   The Federal Reserve will boost a key interest
rate within the next month and then hope that credit-tightening
move will be enough to keep inflation in check until the November
election, many analysts believe.
   These economists said they expect the Fed to increase its
discount rate, the interest the central bank charges on loans to
member banks, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   The Fed has already executed a series of three tightening moves
beginning in late March, but it has held back from increasing its
discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the central bank can
make to demonstrate its intention to push interest rates higher.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday proposed a
redistribution of power in the Soviet Union to give new authority
to the president and legislature. But he ruled out a multiparty
system and indicated the Communist Party would retain control of
local government.
   In a 3{-hour speech opening the first Communist Party conference
in 47 years, Gorbachev sketched a vision of a nation strikingly
different from the authoritarian state built by Josef Stalin. He
called for a country that would be ruled by law and guarantee
individual rights.
   ``The Soviet people want a clear perspective,'' Gorbachev
concluded. ``They want full-blooded and unconditional democracy.
They want a rule of law without reservations.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday proposed a broad
but vague separation of powers between the Communist Party and
government legislatures that would be made stronger but remain
subordinate to the party.
   Gorbachev called for a new, full-time national legislature to be
headed by a president with power to oversee foreign and defense
policy and appoint the head of government.
   But the Communist Party chief said legislative bodies, or
soviets, still would be expected to implement party policies, and
he appeared to limit their independent development by recommending
that the positions of local party head and government leader be
held by the same person.

   Just as farm equipment manufacturers
were beginning to enjoy a rebound from an eight-year slump, the
drought is turning customers cautious and cooling off the recovery.
   Farmers who had been sizing up tractors and harvesting equipment
have put off purchases while they wait to see if their crop will be
saved by rain, said Bill Hassenfritz, an owner of Hassenfritz Inc.,
a farm equipment dealer in the the southeastern Iowa town of
Mediapolis.
   ``The attitude of farmers was really quite high,'' he said. ``I
can't say (the drought) has completely blown that, but it has put
it on hold.''

   Investigators in the Pentagon bribery probe
regard as significant potential evidence videotapes of
surreptitiously recorded meetings between Defense Department
personnel and industry consultants, sources familiar with the
investigation said Tuesday.
   More than one of the tapes picked up an audible sound track of
the conversation, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The sources refused to say whether the tapes show money or
confidential government documents changing hands, but one said
``the participants are doing more than talking.''
   One source said ``there aren't that many videotapes, videotapes
are not an extensive technique in the case,'' largely because of
the difficulty of making arrangements to tape a meeting that might
be taking place without much advance notice.
   But the sources said the government regards the videotapes as
important evidence when combined with extensive wiretapping that
has been the basic tool in the investigation to date.

   Edwin Meese's frequent use of an FBI jet is
under scrutiny by a House subcommittee chairman who says the
attorney general may have violated President Reagan's mandate to

   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., has directed the General Accounting
Office, the investigative wing of Congress, to attempt to cut
through a shroud of secrecy the FBI and Justice Department have
placed over Meese's travels.
   Between June 3, 1986, and May 11, 1987, Meese used an FBI

   Pope John Paul II installed 24 cardinals
Tuesday, offered them as symbols of church unity and urged
followers of rebel French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre not to break
with the papacy.
   Lefebvre plans to consecrate four traditionalist bishops
Thursday without papal permission, which the Vatican has said will
result in automatic excommunication of those involved. John Paul
says a schism in the Roman Catholic church, the first since 1870,
appears inevitable.
   The church crisis cast a shadow over the otherwise joyous
ceremony of conferring red hats on the new ``princes of the
church,'' who include two U.S. archbishops, James Hickey of
Washington, D.C., and Edmund Szoka of Detroit.

   Workers with heavy machinery tore apart the
wreckage of two commuter trains Tuesday and found more bodies,
raising to 59 the number killed in a head-on crash the railroad
blamed on a brake problem.
   Officials of the state-run rail company said the veteran
engineer on the runaway train realized his brakes weren't working
more than a mile from the busy Gare de Lyon station, and warned his
passengers to get to the back of the train before impact.
   The rail company also disclosed that the engineer first realized
there was a brake problem after the train had been stopped five
miles from the accident site by a passenger who had pulled an
emergency cord.

   The brazen insider trading scheme alleged by the
government against a Morgan Stanley & Co. rookie analyst and a
client raises big questions about whether Wall Street has been
properly policing itself in the aftermath of the Ivan Boesky
scandal, securities lawyers and professionals said Tuesday.
   Some expressed shock that Stephen Wang Jr., a Morgan trainee
with limited experience, could have obtained access to secrets
about corporate takeovers and systematically misused them as he is
accused, flouting the firm's ethics code and ignoring the negative
publicity about insider trading.
   ``If the allegations are true, no matter what happens, it shows
that some people don't get the message,'' said Michael Feldberg, a
former U.S. prosecutor who practices with the law firm Shea & Gould
in New York. ``It's amazing.''

   After Joseph F. Fernandez, 51, the agency's former station chief
in Costa Rica, entered his plea in U.S. District Court, his
attorney said he had committed no crime and that his indictment
sends a ``chilling message'' to the nation's intelligence agents.
   The message tells agents that ``Should you become enmeshed in

political harmony at home, you may find yourselves upon your return
to the United States the targets of criminal prosecutions,''
defense attorney Thomas E. Wilson said in a statement to reporters.

articles about euthanasia.
   The American Medical Association's 420-member House of
Delegates, a legislative body representing 295,000 members,
approved a statement stressing its opposition ``to a physician
intentionally causing the death of a patient.''
   The delegates reiterated their stand in the wake of an uproar
over the publication of an article in January in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. The article by an unidentified doctor
described how he ended a cancer patient's life, at her request,
with a lethal dose of morphine.

   Today is Saturday, July 9, the 191st day of 1988. There are 175
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 9, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read aloud
to Gen. George Washington's troops in New York.
   On this date:
   In 1540, England's King Henry VIII had his six-month marriage to
his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, annulled.
   In 1755, British General Edward Braddock was mortally wounded as
his troops suffered a massive defeat near present-day Pittsburgh
during the French and Indian War. One of the survivors was an aide
to Braddock, Col. George Washington.
   In 1816, Argentina declared its independence from Spain.
   In 1819, sewing-machine inventor Elias Howe was born in Spencer,
Mass.
   In 1850, the 12th president of the United States, Zachary
Taylor, died in the White House, having served only one year and
four months of his term.
   In 1918, 101 people were killed in the worst train wreck in U.S.
history as an inbound local collided with an outbound express in
Nashville, Tenn.
   In 1947, the engagement of Britain's Princess Elizabeth to Lt.
Philip Mountbatten was announced.
   In 1951, President Harry S. Truman asked Congress to formally
end the state of war between the United States and Germany.
   In 1976, Uganda called on the U.N. Security Council to condemn
Israel for its raid on Entebbe Airport July 4 to rescue hostages
held by pro-Palestinian hijackers.
   In 1982, a Pan Am Boeing 727 crashed in Kenner, La., killing all
146 people aboard and eight people on the ground.
   In 1986, the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography
released the final draft of its 2,000-page report, which linked
hard-core porn to sex crimes.
   Ten years ago: Nearly 100,000 demonstrators marched through
Washington, D.C., to call for an extension of the seven-year
deadline for ratification of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution.
   Five years ago: Kathy Wilson, the Republican head of the
National Women's Political Caucus, called on President Reagan not
to seek a second term, saying he was a ``dangerous man'' for
American women.
   One year ago: In his third day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Lt.
Col. Oliver North said he had shredded evidence as part of a
long-planned cover-up of his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Today's birthdays: Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath is
72. Actor James Hampton is 52. Football hall-of-famer O.J. Simpson
is 41. Actor Tom Hanks is 32.
   Thought for today: ``Never invest your money in anything that
eats or needs repainting.'' _ Billy Rose, American musical producer
(1899-1966).

<HEAD>Midsummer Surprise: ABC's `Hothouse' Set in Mental Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In ABC's new summer series ``Hothouse,'' set in
a private mental hospital, the inmates don't take control of the
asylum, or even the show. The doctors are the ones worth watching.
   This is the first new series from executive producer Jay Presson
Allen, a screenwriter (``Prince of the City,'' among many others)
and novelist whose only previous network series was the critically
acclaimed ``Family.'' Hopes were high when ABC announced she would
be doing another. ``Hothouse'' might just live up to expectations.
   ``Hothouse'' premieres Thursday with a two-hour pilot, then will
continue as an hour-long series on Thursdays.
   The show is not on ABC's fall schedule, and that may frustrate
viewers prone to getting hooked on well-written nighttime soaps,
especially in the midst of dull summer reruns.
   Don't be put off by a lackluster beginning of the two-hour
movie. The writers at first seem to be asking that viewers get
interested in the patients of the fictional Garrison Center, a
small, private institution outside Boston. The transparent
anxieties of an aging wife whose husband no longer seems to need
her and a troubled youth whose worst offense is slinging a
milkshake at a social worker aren't exactly riveting.
   But by the end of the two hours, the doctors, nurses and
administrators emerge as interesting, well-rounded characters.
   The cast is exceptional and includes such notables as Josef
Sommer, Alexis Smith and Michael Learned.
   Sommer is Dr. Sam Garrison, the patriarch of the center and a
family that includes psychiatrist daughter Issy, short for Isabel,
played by Katherine Borowitz, her father's biggest supporter and
perhaps closest friend; a bottom-line accountant son, Matt (Tony
Soper) _ ``I see,'' he tells his father during one of their many
money vs. humanity arguments, ``you're St. Francis and I'm Ivan
Boesky'' _ and another son, Steve, not seen in the pilot, who also
is a psychiatrist but moved to London with his young daughter to
get over the death of his wife.
   Issy is married to Leonard Schrader (Bob Gunton who played Juan
Peron in ``Evita'' on Broadway), the center's lovable medical
doctor. Matt is married to beautiful, young Claudia (Susan Diol),
who feels suffocated by her husband's family. In the pilot, we
learn she is expecting a baby.
   It turns out Sam is not the know-all, be-all of mental health
that he would seem. His wife, Lily (Smith), left him after 37 years
of marriage, and he is still running guilt trips on her. She
returns in the pilot with her wealthy new husband. They buy a
country place near the center so she can spend time with her
children, especially Issy, who resents her for abandoning Dad.
   Among the other doctors are suave Ved Lahari, played by Art
Malik (``Jewel in the Crown''), an Indian raised in England who is
having an affair with an older doctor, Marie Teller (Learned), a
consummate professional and long-time associate of Garrison.
   Art Makter (Michael Jeter) spends his time making jokes about
his shortness and wants more than anything to write a pop
psychology best-seller and ``go on Oprah Winfrey.'' At one point
the other doctors sit around the lunch room joking about his
progress. ``He's writing a chapter on narcissistic self-hatred
called `How Can I Miss Me If I Won't Go Away,'' says one. Adds
another, ``He told me he's writing one called, `Is the Woman
Sitting Next to you Your Brother? Gender Confusion and Sibling
Rivalry.''
   Head nurse Lucy Cox (Maureen Moore) is the no-nonsense toughie
who in the pilot runs off a struggling social worker for being a
ditz.
   ``Hothouse'' needs to develop more compelling patient stories to
become a well-rounded series, the way ``L.A. Law'' involves viewers
both with the attorneys and with their clients' cases. In at least
the first two hours of ``Hothouse,'' the doctors are the only ones
who seem human enough to need a psychiatrist. Fortunately, they are
enough reason to tune in again.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Americans and Soviets will be marching to the
same drummer this summer, at least for a while, as youngsters from
both nations set aside ideologies and take up musical instruments
in an orchestra-to-go.

   While President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev were discussing weighty international matters,
dozens of young musicians in the United States and the Soviet Union
were preparing for a musical summit of sorts.
   The American-Soviet Youth Orchestra, composed of 110 musicians
representing both countries, will make its debut in August with a
monthlong concert swing across the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   ``It's such a great opportunity to make music and travel in the
United States and travel in Russia,'' says Caroline Coade, 20, of
San Diego, Calif.
   Coade, a student of the viola who graduated May 30 from Oberlin
College, is one of 58 Americans and 52 Soviets, ages 17 to 23,
selected for the orchestra. Twelve participants are from Oberlin
College.
   The orchestra will assemble on Oberlin's campus on July 16 for
rehearsals and workshops to acquaint them with each other's social
and cultural traditions.
   The orchestra's opening concert is scheduled for Aug. 5 at the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Zubin Mehta,
music director of the New York Philharmonic, will conduct.
   The orchestra grew out of a luncheon attended by Oberlin
President S. Frederick Starr, an expert on Soviet affairs, and
officials of AFS Intercultural Programs, an international exchange
group based in New York, says Grace Kennan Warnecke, the
orchestra's executive director.
   Warnecke, daughter of George F. Kennan, former U.S. ambassador
to the Soviet Union, initiated negotiations with the Soviet
Ministry of Culture last year. She says the idea ``was greeted with
far more enthusiasm on both sides than anticipated ... which is not
to say it still isn't hard.''
   In the Soviet Union, the orchestra will be sponsored by the
Ministry of Culture and Gosconsert.
   Warnecke says a joint orchestra would have been impossible
before glasnost, the new spirit of openness in the Soviet Union,
although separate tours have been permitted.
   ``What's different about this is we're creating a brand new
institution, and that's never happened before,'' says Warneke, who
lived in the Soviet Union periodically as a child and attended
fifth grade in a Soviet school while her father was ambassador.
   She says the orchestra could be ongoing, but efforts are
concentrated on this year's program.
   ``If glasnost becomes a complete success, increasing openness to
the point that we don't need a Soviet-American orchestra ...
(we'll) put ourselves out of business and that's all the better,''
she says.
   The American musicians represent 24 states and were chosen from
some 500 who auditioned either in person or by tape. They are to
receive expenses and a small allowance from foundations who have
agreed to finance the program, according to Warneke.
   While touring the United States, the musicians will stay in
dormitories, private homes or hotels.
   The trip to the Soviet Union is an important element for Claudia
Lasareff-Mironoff, 23, who is studying for a master's degree in
viola at Northwestern University. Her parents left the Soviet Union
as children and emigrated to the United States after World War II.
   ``I think it's really important that we share musical ideas. The
Russian school of string playing is such a famous school. I'm
really excited to be an American string player and to be getting to
share in that,'' says Lasareff-Mironoff, who speaks Russian.
   One of the musicians, Calvin Lewis, 18, of Hephzibah, Ga., who
studies the violin at the Cleveland Institute of Music, says he's
eager to hear the Soviet musicians perform. Lewis says he doesn't
know any Russian but suspects the Soviets will know some English.
   ``Music is a language in itself. I don't think there'll be a
problem,'' says Lewis, who will be making his first trip out of the
country.
   One of the youngest participants will be Junko Kaji, 17, a
junior at Maumee Valley Country Day School in Toledo. She's been
playing the violin since the age of 3 and plays in a youth
orchestra in Toledo.
   Kaji says the tour in the Soviet Union is an opportunity to see
whether her perceptions of that country are valid. ``I thought I
might want to see what the (Soviets) are really like,'' she says.
   During the orchestra's 2{ weeks in Oberlin, they will rehearse
with Larry Rachleff, Oberlin conductor and music director, and
Leonid Nikolaev for the Moscow Conservatory of Music.
   After the opening concert, the musicians will perform in New
York City on Aug. 7; Milwaukee, Aug. 9; San Francisco, Aug. 11 and
Trenton, N.J., Aug. 14. The Soviet tour will open and close with
concerts in Moscow, with four concerts in two other cities in
between.
   The orchestra's repertoire will include works by American and
Russian composers, and the New York performance will include the
world premiere of a symphonic piece by Soviet composer Edison
Denisov.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It started as a backyard picnic. Over the past
42 years it has become a family tradition for a special American
family, the veterans of the famed World War II jungle fighting unit
known as Merrill's Marauders. As one says, ``We're more than
friends.''
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   They are old men now, many in their 80s, but they remain as
fierce in their loyalty to one another and to an annual tradition
as they were when they fought and suffered together and earned the
nickname Merrill's Marauders.
   For the 42nd year in a row the graying Marauders will assemble,
this time in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 2-4, to refight the old
battles and talk about Bull-Fight Brandy, a concoction of their own
never approved by the medics, and swap pictures of grandchildren.
   ``I'm sure there will be a few who will attend for the first
time along with those who show up every year,'' says Tom Martini of
Charlotte, this year's reunion chairman.
   ``The difficulty is in getting the word out. With so many moving
to new homes in retirement it's hard to keep a current mailing
list, which was never complete to begin with.
   ``After all these years, some guys arrive and say `I never knew
about it before.'''
   But they have never forgotten the Marauders.
   For six months in 1944, twice as long as the operation had been
originally planned, the Marauders became the stuff of legend. They
fought in five major and 30 minor actions against veteran Japanese
troops behind enemy lines in northern Burma. When their final
objective was taken, their force of 3,200 numbered fewer than 500
who could be classified as effective fighting men.
   ``Yes,'' says Marauder Phil Piazza of Seneca, S.C., ``we were
all volunteers, and, yes, we have discussed at our reunions why we
volunteered.
   ``Why did I? I guess I was a little bit crazy. I was single. I
was anxious to see some action. Don't forget, World War II was not
like the Vietnam War. We had a clear purpose. I wanted to be a part
of it. I think most of the others would tell you just about the
same thing.
   ``It was an experience none of us would want to relive. But it
had to be done, and we would do it again if necessary.''
   They had all responded to a request for volunteers for ``a
hazardous mission somewhere.'' They were never told where. And
there is evidence supporting Piazza's idea that they were men who
actually liked combat.
   In a book about the unit (written in part from material gathered
at a reunion) Marauder Charlton Ogburn, of Beaufort, S.C., recalled
the 1st Battalion commander suggesting, in a lull between battles,
that if nothing else was going to happen they might cross the ridge
and start a fight with 2nd Battalion.
   ``Of course he was joking,'' writes Ogburn, ``but all the same
...the idea had occurred to him.''
   Merrill's Marauder's was the name given by a Time Magazine
reporter to honor their commander, Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill. Their
official designation was 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), which
led one Marauder, under fire, to wonder what the hell had become of
the other 5,306.
   They had come from Army units in the South Pacific, Puerto Rico,
Panama and the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Ga. Their job was
to cut Japanese communications, hit the enemy from the flank and
rear, and open the strategically important Ledo Road.
   They fought in jungle, never knowing what terror lay beyond the
next bend in the trail, and made famous such forgettable names as
Walawbum, Shaduzup, Nhpum Ga, Inkangatawng and Myitkyina. But they
never forgot.
   They lost 93 killed, 293 wounded and five times that many to
disease. ``In the end,'' wrote the medical historian of the
China-Burma-India theater, ``amoebas, bacteria, rickettsiae and
viruses, rather than Japanese soldiers and guns, vanquished the
most aggressive, bravest and toughest outfit that fought in the Far
East in the Second World War.''
   In the end, Merrill's Marauders won a Presidential Unit
Citation, six Distinguished Service Crosses, four Legions of Merit,
44 Silver Stars and a Bronze Star for every man in the regiment.
Their shoulder patch lives on as the symbol for the 1st Battalion
of the 75th Infantry Ranger Regiment.
   A few years ago a Marauder spotted a decal of the patch on the
window of a car ahead, chased the car for miles along the
Pennsylvania Turnpike, caught up, motioned for the driver to pull
over _ and learned about the reunion.
   Phil Piazza was the one who started the reunion. He was
commander of a heavy weapons company of Blue Combat team of 2nd
Battalion.
   ``We had three battalions, each with two combat teams.
Naturally, nobody in the unit could know all the 3,000 men in the
regiment, but I knew my company and my battalion. I lived in
Bridgeport, Conn., then, and after the war a few of us in the area
would get together from time to time and finally I said to them,
`Why not make it an annual affair?'
   ``We were all back working at new jobs and none of us had any
vacation time accumulated, so we picked Labor Day weekend. We held
the first reunion in my back yard. We worked from a list of
who-knows-where-who-is, and about 75 guys showed up.
   ``Well, Labor Day weekend became the traditional time to hold
it, which makes it difficult for some who have other family plans,
but in recent years we have always had 300 to 400 on hand. That
includes wives and children, and now, grandchildren.''
   Over the years, the generations, the reunion has grown from a
gathering of warriors to a fellowship of families. Some save up all
year for the annual blast.
   ``We've had some wonderful trips,'' says Jean Martini, whose
courtship with Tom included frequent letters to him in Burma.
``We've been to Phoenix, Chicago, Savannah, Charleston, St. Louis,

we went to New Orleans.''
   Romance has blossomed. The widow of a Marauder married a

   Many of the reforms now emanating from Moscow
were put forth 20 years ago in Czechoslovakia, only to be swept
away by a Soviet-led invasion. Their rebirth with the Kremlin's
imprimatur, however, is met with skepticism in today's
Czechoslovakia. Here's why.

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after Soviet tanks
crushed Alexander Dubcek's ``Prague Spring'' of reform,
Czechoslovaks are deeply leery of the changes now proclaimed in
Moscow and echoed by their own leaders.
   A key reason is that Dubcek was crushed and disgraced for trying
them, or at least letting them go too far.
   Czechoslovaks today wonder if the same will happen to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his Soviet reforms _ perestroika (restructuring) and
glasnost (openness) _ leaving them worse off than they are now.
   They are aware that old-time, conservative Communists are still
around and a fear of their traditional hard line remains.
   The skepticism of reform surfaces in countless jokes:
   _What is the difference between Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander
Dubcek? None, but Gorbachev doesn't know it yet.
   _What is the difference between perestroika and chess? In chess,
you think before you move.
   _``Think in a new way?'' a cartoon character asks his boss,
echoing a new Communist slogan. ``But for years you've been telling
me not to think at all.''
   In the years after the Prague Spring, Czechs and Slovaks still
seemed stunned by the Soviet-led invasion on the night of Aug.
20-21, 1968, that erased Dubcek's movement to bring a new face to
Czechoslovak communism _ multiparty politics, freedom of the press,
speech and religion, a liberalized economy.
   When it was over Dubcek was expelled from the Communist Party
and went off to his native Slovakia to work as a clerk in a
forestry office.
   At the same time, the chanting, singing, joyous people of the
Prague Spring vanished from the streets and squares. Most retreated
morosely back to their private lives to pursue a material wealth
that was the party's reward for their political silence.
   In 1988, that post-invasion reward is running low.
   Czechoslovakia's outmoded industry is performing poorly, forcing
planners to scale down production targets and to slash coveted wage
bonuses.
   Shortages are again apparent in shops.
   On the political front, while Prague's leaders tinker with
reform, the winds of change blowing from Gorbachev's Kremlin are
prompting more citizens to challenge the Communists on issues
ranging from ecology to cultural and religious freedom.
   But the memory of 1968 makes Czechoslovaks wary of placing too
much faith in Gorbachev and in turn their own leaders, as well as
reforms.
   As one Prague man put it, Soviet reforms sound to Czechoslovaks
like ``the right ideas from the wrong side.''
   Even deeper skepticism is reserved for the cautious reforms
adopted so far by the Communist leaders installed by Moscow 20
years ago to make sure Dubcek's experiments would not be repeated.
   After spending 18 years assailing change, Czechoslovakia's
Communists have now fallen in step behind Gorbachev, endorsing
perestroika and adopting the rhetoric of reform. But the sense
among many in Prague is that there is no guarantee of any
meaningful or lasting effect.
   This past December, the party even changed its leader,
substituting a 65-year-old apparatchik, Milos Jakes (pronouned
Ya-kesh), for an increasingly frail Gustav Husak, 75.
   Jakes immediately set about trying to revamp the image of the
party leader, emulating Gorbachev by taking well-publicized trips
to factories and farms to chat with workers.
   Borrowing many phrases from Gorbachev, Jakes spoke of the need
for economic and social reform at a key party meeting in April that
brought some new, younger faces into the party elite.
   But Jakes lacks Gorbachev's touch. At February's snow-dampened
celebrations of the 40th anniversary of Communist power, crowds
streamed away from the square when Jakes got up to speak.
   Few Czechoslovaks can forget that it was Jakes who oversaw the
expulsion of almost 500,000 party members in a post-Dubcek purge.
   They also know that Husak, who took over from Dubcek in March
1969, is still on the ruling Politburo.
   When Jakes talks of reform, however, he pointedly omits mention
of glasnost, which has brought startling frankness to the Soviet
media. Jakes stresses that Czechoslovakia's 1.7 million Communists
must dictate the pace and shape of any change.
   An unspoken fear is that reform will spin outside the party's
control, as the Communists say it did in Dubcek's days.
   Even economic change is treated with extreme caution,
particularly by managers who report that overhasty reforms in the
Soviet Union are making it difficult for them to deal with Soviet
enterprises.
   Planned decentralization of management is not likely to go as
far here as it has in the Soviet Union and won't be in full force
until 1991.

<TEXT>
   ``Restructuring cannot be too hasty,'' said Svatopluk Smutny, an
economics editor at the Communist Party newspaper Rude Pravo. ``It
is far too important a change and needs to be thought out in detail
and consequences.''
   Communists like Smutny reluctantly admit to some parallels
between the current situation and 1968, when Dubcek at the age of
46 became party leader with a mandate to implement market-oriented
reforms designed to boost the economy.
   But Dubcek opted for political reform as well, advocating
changes Gorbachev now wants 20 years later.
   It was a heady spell wistfully remembered by many.
   ``It was, quite simply, the best time of my life,'' recalled one
man who was then a teen-ager in Prague.
   For Communists, 1968 carries a different message. They remember
how Dubcek promised that his reforms were irreversible, and look
anxiously now toward Moscow for signs of a conservative backlash
that could crunch Gorbachev.
   If Gorbachev strengthens his hold on power, both Moscow and
Prague may eventually re-evaluate the 1968 invasion _ in effect, a
Kremlin acknowledgment that it was the wrong thing to do and won't
happen again.
   Such a reappraisal would be popular with those who remember
1968, and create space for change that would be welcomed by those
who have grown up since.
   Both these groups increasingly have turned outside the system
for spiritual fulfillment, opening up what the banned playwright
Vaclav Havel recently termed ``a yawning chasm between two
virtually unrelated worlds _ the world of official ideology and the
world of the authentic attitudes and beliefs of society.''
   The rigid controls on Czechoslovakia's active state-run culture
have loosened a little with the advent of glasnost in Moscow.
   The first political satire in 20 years has been staged, a few
unofficial art shows mounted and a handful of previously banned
movies screened.
   The immense popularity of officially tolerated and underground
rock-music groups has forced authorities to issue more good rock
music on the sole, state-owned record label, as well as to relax
bans on some groups and to promote the occasional rock concert.
   Anxious perhaps to follow the example of Soviet television
programs beamed daily to Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million people, the
state-run media have become a mite more lively and provocative.
   But, while the name of Franz Kafka has made a rare appearance in
a literary journal, his full works are still unpublished in his
native Prague.
   Orthodox Communists visiting Moscow return genuinely appalled by
the outspoken new plays, books and films in the Soviet Union.
   Plays by Havel, performed to high acclaim in the West, remain
banned in Czechoslovakia, and dissidents forced to take manual jobs
are unlikely to return to their professions any time soon.
   Secret police no longer block the doors of dissidents' homes.
But three seminars called by the human rights group Charter 77 have
been broken up by police, who expelled 33 foreigners who attended
meetings in Prague June 17-18.
   In Bratislava in March, authorities sharply dampened the growing
activism of religious believers when police broke up a peaceful
demonstration by about 2,000 Roman Catholics.
   Religion has proved an increasingly attractive spiritual refuge
over the past five years, and some 600,000 believers recently
signed a 31-point petition for religious freedom, the largest such
action in Soviet bloc history.
   Another issue on which Czechoslovaks are increasingly outspoken
is the environment, which has been severely damaged by crash
industrialization.
   Opinions vary about whether these specific challenges to or
retreats from official doctrine will one day spill over into revolt.
   ``The moral situation is each year worse,'' said a pessimistic
Ivan Klima, a writer and Charter 77 signatory. ``The people are
cautious _ that is the mildest word. They don't find any reason for
engagement in political activity.''
   ``Fear rules our society,'' said the Rev. Vaclav Maly, a Roman
Catholic priest stripped of his license to preach. ``People are
generally well informed, but fear prevents them from doing
anything.''
   Very slowly, he said, this attitude is changing as people
realize ``it is not enough'' to preserve the perks of a relatively
high standard of living.
   Havel, too, sees change coming.
   ``Between the society and the leadership there is a bigger and
bigger gap,'' he said. ``You don't find anybody anywhere who says,
`This excellent government.' ... I don't know if something will
happen, but I think that something must happen.''
   If political change comes, he added, ``society is well prepared.
People know what to do.''

   Alexander Dubcek, ousted by the Soviets after they crushed his
Prague Spring liberalization movement in 1968, lives today in the
seclusion of a villa overlooking Bratislava, capital of his native
Slovakia.
   Officially, he is a retired forestry clerk.
   Dubcek was arrested after the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968
but released and allowed to remain on in his post as
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leader.
   From then on it was an escalator ride to oblivion:
   _April, 1969: He is removed as party leader and named president
of Parliament, a largely ceremonial post.
   _September: In a purge of the party Central Committee, he is
fired as Parliament president.
   _December: Dubcek is named ambassador to Turkey.
   _March, 1970: He is suspended from the Communist Party.
   _June: He is formally expelled from the Communist Party and
called home from Turkey.
   _July: Dubcek is recalled as a deputy in Parliament's House of
the People, his last remaining official post. He and his wife,
Anna, move into political exile in Slovakia, where he is given a
job as a clerk in a forestry office.
   From then on, little is known, except that Dubcek, now 66 years
old, is retired from his forestry job.
   He and his family are said to have been kept under close
surveillance until Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the reformist Soviet
leader, visited Czechoslovakia in April, 1987.
   He made a few trips to Prague this year and on one occasion was
loudly applauded when he attended a theater performance.
   However, an attempt earlier this year by Dubcek and some other
Communist leaders from the Prague Spring to found an alternative
political grouping was repressed.

<TEXT>
   A major force the
Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders face is growing religious faith,
in defiance of the government's atheistic teachings.
   Every Sunday, people of all ages cram Bratislava's Roman
Catholic churches.
   More and more young Czechoslovaks are turning to the Roman
Catholic and other churches.
   No official statistics are available on the number of believers.
The Vatican estimates that 60 percent of the country's 15.5 million
people are Roman Catholics, but state television says believers
make up just 25 to 30 percent of the population.
   The Roman Catholic Church has recently become a newly powerful
force, with some 600,000 believers signing a lay petition for more
religious freedom.
   The petition had the unprecedented backing of 89-year-old
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who took the mass support as a signal
for a strong attack on the Communists' refusal to appoint bishops
in nine of the country's 13 sees or to allow more religious
education.
   Believers' frustrations over church policy have spilled over
into regular demonstrations outside the cardinal's residence in
Prague with calls for religious freedom and a visit from Pope John
Paul II.
   Perhaps influenced by the Kremlin's new tolerance of the Russian
Orthodox Church and growing Western condemnation of its church
policy, the Prague government sanctioned the consecration of three
new bishops in June.
   But, a Slovak believer recently warned, ``Religion is not free
here. Don't be deceived.''
   It is not clear where the new militancy of the Roman Catholic
Church could lead. As the only organized body outside Communist
control, it has always attracted party ire.
   The church's situation in Czechoslovakia is much worse than
elsewhere in the Soviet bloc, something believers attribute in part
to the ideological crackdown that followed the failed attempts at
Communist reforms in 1968.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Presidio''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many Paramount Pictures in recent years, ``The Presidio''
is slickly produced, action-filled, well acted _ and empty.
Disney's Touchstone Pictures, produced mostly by Paramount alumni,
exhibit the same tendencies. The films have the same kind of
homogeneity of the Warner Bros. movies of the 1930s, but without an
equal vitality.
   The formula has obviously worked wonders at the box-office
(``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Top Gun''), but the sameness of product
may be responsible for Paramount's precipitous drop (before
```Crocodile' Dundee II'') in its share of the nation's theater
business.
   There's nothing about ``The Presidio'' that can't be enjoyed
between gulps of popcorn. Director Peter Hyams provides an
abundance of well-staged action, some of it meaningless, and the
players are attractive. But you have the feeling that, given a
wider range of imagination, the film could have been more than a
generation-gap detective chase.
   Mark Harmon is a former military police officer now working for
the San Francisco police department. Sean Connery is an army
provost marshal whose service dates back to the Korean War (his
accent is explained by his Scottish birth). They detest each other
because Harmon did not follow army regulations in arresting an
abusive officer years before.
   The antagonism grows as Harmon casts his lecherous eyes on
Connery's nubile, independent daughter, Meg Ryan. He soon beds her,
and she rebels against her domineering father.
   The two detectives are investigating the murder of a woman M.P.
at the officer's club of the 212-year-old Presidio near the Golden
Gate Bridge. Connery and Harmon are constantly at odds, but of
course each develops a grudging respect for the sleuthing skills of
the other. The investigation leads them to a smuggling conspiracy
by former agents of the CIA, Hollywood's favorite new villains.
   Larry Ferguson's screenplay offers no real surprises except for
the identity of one of the conspirators. Hyams (``2010,'' ``Running
Scared'') is an expert at this kind of action. His chases through
San Francisco _ that most photogenic of American cities _ pack
excitement, and his cars leap higher into the air than those in
``Bullitt'' and ``What's Up, Doc?''
   Sean Connery is his usually dominating self, though his barroom
punchout of an annoying punkster is one of the least convincing of
recent movie brawls. Mark Harmon is ingratiating, but he has yet to
show much behind that puppydog smile. Meg Ryan has a few effective
moments amid all the macho doings.
   ``The Presidio'' is rated R for language, sex and violence.
Running time: 97 minutes. Producer: D. Constantine Conte.

   A Mike Tyson fight is almost as hot as Muhammad
Ali's ``Thrilla in Manila'' and ``Rumble in the Jungle'' were a
decade or so ago when ``the Greatest'' took on Joe Frazier and
George Forman.
   And for those who couldn't afford tickets to Tyson's June 27
clash with Michael Spinks in Atlantic City, HBO Video will release
the home videocassette on July 13.
   Meanwhile, HBO has already put out ``Mike Tyson's Greatest
Hits,'' an hour-long montage of the heavyweight boxer's best
fights, including his World Boxing Congress, World Boxing
Association and International Boxing Federation championship
triumphs.
   The video opens with the late legendary trainer Cus D'Amato
taking Tyson from the angry sidewalks of Brownsville and
Bedford-Stuyvesant and molding him into a precision-run diesel.
   ``Remember,'' D'Amato counsels the young kid of iron, ``it's
always good to throw the punch where you can hit him and he can't
hit you. That's what the science of boxing is all about.''
   The tape shows Tyson fine-tuning his awesome knock-out punch
against such early opponents as Trent Singleton, Donald Halpin,
Rick Spain, Michael Johnson and Hector Mercades. The video also
includes footage of Tyson's defeat of long-time champ Larry Holmes.
   ``Mike Tyson's Greatest Hits'' is the first video in a series of
boxing programs planned by HBO. It retails in VHS for $19.99.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Housekeeping'' and ``Benji the
Hunted.''

   ``Housekeeping'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video; VHS-Beta, $79.95;
Rated PG)
   
   This entertaining, offbeat comedy centers around an eccentric
aunt and the two orphaned nieces left in her care. One is a
conformist; the other opts to be a free spirit.
   The two luckless orphans are in need of a parent when Aunt
Sylvie, played by Christine Lahti, returns to her tiny hometown in
the Pacific Northwest to care for them. She isn't much on
housekeeping, and the children seem to be taking care of her.
   Sylvie stockpiles old newspapers in the home, collects and
stacks tin cans, naps on park benches, keeps crumbs in her pockets
for imaginary children, grows fungus in flower pots and never cuts
the lawn.
   The two girls, Lucille and Ruthie, played by Canadians Sara
Walker and Andrea Burchill in their first roles, don't have much of
a choice when it comes to parents. They never knew their father.
   As for their mother, after leaving her two young daughters at
their grandmother's house in the mountain community of Fingerbone,
she drives her car off a cliff and into a deep lake, killing
herself. Years later, when the grandmother dies, Aunt Sylvie comes
to live with them.
   Eventually, Lucille is repulsed by Sylvie's eccentricities, and
figures out their lifestyle is weird. She starts dressing up and
makes new friends while plotting to leave town to see the world.
She finally leaves and moves in with a teacher.
   Ruthie, however, embraces her aunt's carefree lifestyle. But the
townspeople decide Sylvie must clean up her place and Ruthie must
be removed from such influence.
   But Sylvie and Ruthie stage a disappearance, cover their tracks
and wander off.
   Bill Forsyth (``Gregory's Girl,'' ``Local Hero'') directed this
film, which won raves for Lahti when it had its theatrical run.

   ``Benji The Hunted'' (Walt Disney Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;
Rated G)
   
   ``Benji The Hunted'' provides fresh evidence that the soulful
canine star may be the most accomplished actor in movies today.
   In his latest outing, Benji survives a shipwreck off the Oregon
coast and is on his way to a reunion with owner Frank Innes when he
stumbles upon a litter of orphaned cougar cubs. For the rest of the
film's 89 minutes, Benji struggles against rugged terrain and an
assortment of human and animal villains to find the cubs shelter
and a new mother.
   Director Joe Camp elicits a truly amazing performance from
Benji, his expressive eyes registering whatever emotion the plot
calls for, whether it be fear or slyness or tenderness. In one
startling scene, he brilliantly portrays a canine in conflict, as
Benji must decide whether to reveal himself to a search-and-rescue
helicopter or hide so he can remain in the wilderness to help the
cubs.
   The other actors can't match Benji, although the cubs are
awfully cute and a particularly vicious wolf has a grand death
scene. The human participants are few and there is virtually no
dialogue.
   Children over 4 should enjoy ``Benji the Hunted,'' although the
pace is slow and the story line is occasionally confusing.

   ``Out of Order'' (Warner Bros.) _ Rod Stewart
   
   Spin the first side of ``Out of Order,'' and you not only wonder
why Rod Stewart still has a recording contract, but why he earned
one in the first place.
   Fortunately, most records still have two sides. And side 2 of
this album is as impressive as the first side is depressing.
   That Rod Stewart's been a shallow trend mongerer for most of the
last decade is hardly news. Word that he'd recruited ex-Duran Duran
Andy Taylor and much of the Power Station crew for his new record
seemed to promise an album about two years behind the time.
   Instead, this crew seems to have loosened up Stewart, as his
howl on ``Crazy About Her'' suggests. If this isn't the real Rod
Stewart _ who knows what is anymore? _ at least it's a Stewart that
wears well.
   The two ballads that close this record, a cover of ``Try a
Little Tenderness'' and ``When I Was Your Man'' are both stellar,
as Stewart turns his distinctive growl into something soulful.
   ``Dynamite'' is a raunchy rocker that's more fun than some of
Stewart's more studied efforts. You can almost pity the mod one on
``Nobody Knows When You're Down and Out,'' although his complaint
of opening his door and finding a woman he doesn't know saying
she's having his baby is one of those problems only Rod seems to
have.
   So what happened to side 1? It's packed with clunkers, made all
the more sinful because most are stretched two or three minutes
beyond what a listener can endure.
   One side good, one side bad. The way's Stewart's been going
lately, he should take that batting average.

   ``Evening Star'' (Contemporary Records) _ Joshua Breakstone
   
   Guitarist Joshua Breakstone plays textbook jazz with a few notes
scrawled in the margins.
   If ever a label name fit a musician's style, Contemporary suits
Breakstone perfectly. Yet, he delivers enough of himself in this
recording, his second for the label, to keep the record from being
merely a send up from ghosts of guitarists past, such as Wes
Montgomery or Grant Green. Note, for example, the opening bars of
the album closer, ``Just Open Your Heart.'' A reference to the
atonal mastery of Thelonious Monk, they quickly leave Monk's world
of surprises for more familiar ground, traditional straight-ahead
jazz.
   If you're looking for developing young guitarists to preserve
the traditions of jazz, the New Jersey-born Breakstone is a
candidate. His choice of sidemen for this session proves it. Tommy
Flanagan is on piano and Jimmy Knepper plays trombone. Their styles
polished by years of playing, Flanagan and Knepper make Breakstone
sound refined beyond his 32 years.
   ``Evening Star'' mixes Breakstone's own compositions with
standards. It's an album of nearly seamless playing on which two
masters of the craft _ Flanagan and Knepper _ are bringing along
the next generation.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Sally Kellerman's Versatility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ever-versatile Sally Kellerman appears
this summer in two divergent movie roles: as a film actress
shattered by the end of her marriage, and as operator of a
war-games school for women.
   Is there anything Kellerman can't do? Apparently not. When she
isn't playing her wide range of acting roles, you might find her in
local stage plays, doing voice-overs for commercials and cartoons
or singing her own brand of bluesy music in New York and Hollywood
night spots.
   Kellerman recently chatted about her life at the Hollywood Hills
home she shares with her producer-husband Jonathan Krane and a pair
of friendly dogs. Her blond beauty remains untouched as she nears
50, and she talks more level-headedly than you would expect from
seeing her in eccentric film roles.
   She currently appears in ``Someone to Love,'' which has drawn
raves from some reviewers for its free-form, humanistic qualities.
It's another idiosyncratic film from Henry Jaglom, whose offbeat
movies have usually included his mentor, Orson Welles. In his last
performance, Welles appears throughout ``Someone to Love'' sitting
in a theater seat and offering a running commentary on what is
happening.
   ``Henry and the character he plays in the movie had the idea of
finding out why various friends of his were alone on Valentine's
Day,'' Kellerman said. ``He invited them all to a theater (the
Mayfair in Santa Monica). He said I'd be a movie star who just left
her husband. That was it.
   ``So we all arrived, and he asked questions and had us think
about our characters. It was essentially improvised, and he ended
up in the editing room putting it all together. People say, `Oh,
it's real.' But it wasn't really real.''
   Kellerman first impressed the film world as Hot Lips Houlihan in
the landmark comedy, ``M-A-S-H,'' which brought her a 1970 Academy
nomination as supporting actress.
   ``I don't think I understood show business in the sense of
realizing how lucky I was to get a role and have a job,'' she said.
``After `M-A-S-H' I was out to prove that I was not just Hot Lips
but I could be a million other people. So I looked for the most
serious drama I could find. I tried to dodge around but I often
ended up with roles that were not Hot Lips but were this kind of
zany, kookie, larger-than-life character.
   ``At this time of my life, I'm absolutely loving those kinds of
roles. I enjoyed doing a more human character like the one in
`Someone to Love.' But I also have discovered that I love something
like `All's Fair,' which I did with George Segal. It's the kind of
classic comedy where you start out in suits and painted fingernails
and end up in the dirt fighting.
   ``So I'm not worried about type-casting. Look at Clint Eastwood.
He's done all right playing the same kind of roles.''
   Sally Kellerman was born in Long Beach but grew up in the San
Fernando Valley, ``before they raped the land and before smog.''
Then she attended Hollywood High School. Unlike another alumna,
Lana Turner, she was not discovered for films.
   ``My interests were class, the buddies I hung out with and the
boys I went out with,'' she recalled. ``I did plays in church,
worked as a waitress on Sunset Boulevard, went to acting class with
Jack Nicholson, Robert Blake, Richard Chamberlain.
   ``No, I wasn't discovered in a malt shop.''
   Instead she made her way up the ladder the hard way, in episodic
television.
   ``I had a lot of fun, whirling from one episode to the other,''
she said. ``I was in the pilot of `Star Trek.' One time I played a
Swedish Viking opposite Fred MacMurray in `My Three Sons.' I'd do
Kraft and Chrysler and `Ben Casey' and `Alfred Hitchcock.' But I
was an old-fashioned girl and I always wanted to be in the movies.''
   Her first movie was ``Reform School Girl,'' which gave her one
line in the back of the bus. She followed with bigger parts in
``The Boston Strangler,'' ``The Third Day'' and ``April Fools.''
Then ``M-A-S-H'' came along.
   Did she know it was going to be a hit?
   ``Well, Bob Altman (the director) thought it would be, and
making it was certainly fun,'' she recalled. ``It doesn't always
mean when you have a good time that it will be a good picture, nor
does it mean if you suffer and struggle it will be good. But that
was one time when a picture was both fun and good. I had a blast.''
   She also had a blast doing ``Back to School,'' playing an
English professor to student Rodney Dangerfield. In August, she
teams with Dave Thomas in a live-action version of ``Boris and
Natasha'' from the ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' cartoon series.

<HEAD>The Artists: Russian Revolutionaries Emerge From Storage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUGANO, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For decades, the Russian
revolutionary masters were condemned to storage vaults of Soviet
museums for not toeing the line of Stalinist art.
   ``Perestroika'' has allowed them to re-emerge in the plush
lakeside Villa Favorita amid the priceless art collection of
Switzerland's wealthiest citizen, Baron Heinrich von
Thyssen-Bornemisza. ``Perestroika,'' or ``restructuring,'' is the
term used to describe Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies
of economic and social reforms.
   Thyssen's own art collection comprises 1,400 priceless paintings
ranging from medieval masters to American modern art, plus 600
sculptures and other works. Published estimates of his fortune
range from $700 million to $2.8 billion.
   The special exhibition, on loan from three Soviet museums,
comprises 39 works of ``revolutionary art'' by Vassily Kandinsky,
Kasimir Malevich, Mikhail Larionov and other avant-gardists, most
of whom became ``nonpersons'' under Joseph Stalin.
   The works represent what became known as the ``Great
Experiment'' in Russian art between 1910 and 1930, influenced by
Pablo Picasso and other Westerners as well as Russian traditions.
   Most of the works date back to before the Bolshevik revolution
and before all big names went into exile.
   ``Composition VI'' is a huge (78-by-120 inch) canvas by
Kandinsky, dated 1913. The Lugano show features seven other works
by him; Thyssen's own collection comprises 10.
   Kandinsky, a pioneer of abstract art, died in Neuilly-sur-Seine,
France, in 1944. Thirty-six years later, his widow, Nina, was the
victim of a robbery-murder in Switzerland that was never solved.
   Larionov and his wife, Natalia Goncharova, also died in French
exile. They married in 1955 after 45 years of companionship, and
are represented with four works each. They include her ``Peasants
Picking Apples'' of 1911, influenced by folk art, and his
``Rayonnist Landcsape of 1912,'' a result of experiments with
rayonnism which aimed to portray the light emanating from objects.
   Nine exhibits are by Malevich, the father of what he named
``suprematism'' because he felt that supremacy should be given to
perception, divorced from any particular object.
   Among them is one variant of his monochromatic ``Black Square''
of 1913 that stirred a sensation in the world of art and which he
called a ``zero-form.'' It is shown together with a ``Black
Circle'' and a ``Black Cross.'' A commentary in the exhibition
catalog said, ``It is very unlikely that (these) Suprematist
compositions ... will ever be completely deciphered,'' a view some
visitors may share.
   Thyssen said at the opening that it took several years of
negotiations before Soviet authorities gave the go-ahead for the
loan. Facilitating things was Raisa Gorbachev, the wife of the
Soviet leader, whom Thyssen met during one of his frequent trips to
the Soviet Union.
   The choice of the exhibits was a difficult undertaking, he said.
``There are books but there is no complete list, and often I had to
scout the storage rooms.''
   Thyssen said that as a ``liberal'' he welcomed Perestroika and
the resulting opening up in Russian art.
   ``Things are being straightened out now,'' he said. ``But it
cannot be done from one day to the other. It must take its time.''
   The show, which will last until Oct. 2, is part of the fourth
exchange organized by the Thyssen family foundation and the Soviet
ministry of Culture since 1983 but the first comprising modern
Russian art.
   Thyssen praised what he termed ``an exemplary collaboration''
with his Soviet partners despite occasional unspecified
``difficulties.''
   ``When we started, some people asked me why I was sending our
treasures to Russia; they warned me they would be never returned.
But they came back in perfect shape. In fact, the paintings
received a better treatment there than in some Western countries,''
he said.
   Popular interest in the Soviet exhibitions from his collections
has been incredibly strong.
   ``The people are starved for what comes from the West,'' he
said. To help satisfy such hunger, the foundation is giving away
several glossy catalogs which are printed in the West.
   This year's show from the Thyssen collections opened June 16 in
the Leningrad's State Russian Museum and will move to Moscow in
August. It features 40 modern masters including an early work by
American artist Jackson Pollock.
   However, as in Lugano, Russian revolutionaries are represented,
too: Kandinsky, Larionov and Goncharova, coming home for the first
time since the artists sought creative freedom in the West.

<HEAD>Music Makers: They Give Rap A Good Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The resume is impressive: ``Rolling Stone''
cover, participation in the ``Sun City'' and ``A Very Special
Christmas'' benefit records, an upcoming Amnesty International
tour, anti-drug concerts, frequent community activism.
   So who are we talking about? Sting? Bruce Springsteen?
   Nah. Try Run-DMC, three homeboys from Hollis, Queens.
   ``I'm just happy to do everything they bring,'' said Jam Master
Jay, the DJ for the reigning kings of rap, in discussing their
frequent charity efforts. ``I probably don't even hear about half
the stuff we're asked to do, but we do whatever we can.''
   Strange words from a band that was the subject of screaming
headlines last summer, invariably _ and incorrectly _ predicting
gang violence on their tour with the Beastie Boys. Publicity got so
bad that at one point National Lampoon provided tips on ``How to
Survive a Run-DMC Concert.''
   ``We had press hanging on poles, cameras in the crowd in every
city on the tour and every night they went home disappointed _
nothing bad happened,'' said Jay, whose band has just released its
fourth album, ``Tougher Than Leather.''
   ``I don't think we can put that stuff behind us for five years.
... It sells, man. Nothing positive sells. The history of the press
is negative things,'' he continued. ``They're all in a race to get
the negative things.''
   But Jay, whose real name is Jason Mizell, and partners Joseph
Simmons (Run) and Darryl McDaniels (DMC) insist they are a positive
act. Toward that end, they have established scholarships for kids
from their Hollis neighborhood; this summer, the band will have
voter registration booths at every show on their national tour.
   ``Last year, when we were visiting beaten kids, high school
kids, telling kids to stay off crack, we'd ask, `How many y'all
vote?' And nobody's voting, nobody knew nothing, and the main thing
is nobody's registered,'' said Jay, a supporter of Democratic
presidential contender Jesse Jackson.
   Mention of Tipper Gore, wife of Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and
her Parents Music Resource Center, prompts a quick and cold
response.
   ``Tipper Gore's the type who won't say anything about the
positive, just the negative, looking for controversy,'' Mizell
said. ``If I could sit down and talk to Tip, I could set her
straight.''
   On ``Tougher Than Leather,'' there are some lyrics which could
raise Tipper's eyebrows; mostly, though, the band's first record
since 1986's platinum smash ``Raising Hell'' is aimed at reclaiming
turf from up-and-coming rappers such as LL Cool J and Kool Moe Dee.
   ``My feeling is I'm very happy about everybody's success, but I
know who we are and what we did,'' Mizell said. ``We didn't make up
rap, but we made up being hard. They (other rappers) just don't
know how to do some of the things we do.
   ``And the things we do that they know how to do, we stomp their
stuff. It's a business thing with us _ we're professionals.''
   Mizell lists Public Enemy as his favorite rappers; they will be
touring with Run-DMC and Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince this summer.
The tour will take Run-DMC around the globe and will include
appearances on this summer's Amnesty International benefit tour,
Mizell said.
   The new record features more turntable work by Mizell than
``Raising Hell''; he scratches more and manages to interject
snatches of the Monkees, the Temptations and James Brown.
   ``It's new times, time for a different record, time for a better
record,'' said Mizell in explaining his enlarged role on the
``Tougher.''
   ``I listened to the last record, and I didn't do enough
scratching on it. So this time I cut it up real loud.''
   Mizell is certain of one thing: the group can (and will)
maintain its standing at the top of the rapping mountain.
   ``Nobody can do what I do. I got the best MCs, a positive
message,'' he summed up. ``It keeps coming _ we keep creating,
getting better and better.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Former Oak Ridge Boy Forms Group With Sons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flamboyant William Lee Golden, voted out
of the Oak Ridge Boys' country quartet last year, has a fresh
career singing with his two sons in the new group, the Goldens.
   He has been performing this year with Rusty, 29, and Chris, 25,
in the aftermath of his well-publicized ouster from the Oak Ridge
Boys after 22 years.
   During Golden's 22 years with the group, it won five Grammy
awards. The Oak Ridge Boys are best known for their hits
``Elvira,'' which sold 2 million, and ``Bobbie Sue,'' which sold 1
million.
   Joining his sons has a special significance for Golden, who sang
lead on one of the Oak Ridge Boys' many hits, ``Thank God for
Kids.''
   ``I've learned about music and their youthful enthusiasm,'' the
49-year-old Golden said. ``We go to concerts together and study
what's happening in the music business. When I hear someone on the
radio I don't know, I ask them, `Who is that.' They usually know
and seem attuned to what's going on.''
   The other three members of the Oak Ridge Boys replaced Golden in
1987 because of personal and musical differences. His successor was
former child actor, Steve Sanders, who had played rhythm guitar in
their band for five years.
   Golden, who stood out because of his waist-length hair and
flowing beard, recently talked about his ouster.
   ``I could see the writing on the wall for a while,'' he said.
``When it came down, at first I laughed at how it was handled, then
I got mad. It hit all the emotions. Because after all those years,
22 years, it was sad to think that it had come down to the end the
way it did.
   ``My emotions went in all directions,'' he said. ``They can
still get in a lot of different directions. It takes a team to do
what we did and I still believe in harmony and try to teach harmony
to my family.
   ``Some days you disagree, but a family is forgiving. I'm not
perfect either; I have my faults. I've been guilty of having too
much fun.
   ``I sang harmony every way I could with them. I was there for 22
years and was a dedicated team player. I guess all my time and
energy can be looked upon as a certain phase of my life now. Now,
I'd rather help my family with guidance and assistance.''
   It was the group's first personnel change in 10 years.
   A year before his ouster, Golden recorded an album on his own,
``American Vagabond.''
   ``I was getting frustrated because I had music inside me,''
Golden said. ``That's why I did the solo album. They didn't want me
to do it and wouldn't allow me to sing songs from that album on
stage as the Oak Ridge Boys.''
   After being voted out, Golden filed a $40 million lawsuit
against the group, seeking $10 million in general damages and $30
million in punitive damages.
   But Golden says feelings are mellowing among the four. Lawyers
have been working to settle the lawsuit out of court.
   The Oak Ridge Boys attended a Nashville concert by the Goldens
in early June.
   ``I respect that,'' Golden said.
   ``We speak when we're around each other,'' he added. ``There's
no need in me holding a grudge if we can settle our differences.''
   The Goldens and the Oak Ridge Boys have the same booking agency
and this has led to speculation the two groups may work together.
   ``There's been talk of joining forces and we'll see what would
happen. It's just talk. At least we're talking.''
   Golden is not the only Oak Ridge Boy connection to the Goldens.
Two members of the Goldens' band formerly played in the Oak Ridge
Boys' band.
   The Oak Ridge Boys, a former gospel music group, have continued
to do well without Golden. The quartet recently was voted favorite
group in a poll of viewers by The Nashville Network cable channel.
   ``From what I read, they are happy and doing what they've wanted
for a long time,'' Golden said. ``They seem happy, so that's good.''
   Golden, a native of Brewton, Ala., said he's had to take a
higher profile since teaming with his sons.
   ``The adjustment has been to come out of the shadows to where
I'm singing lead on each song and keep it moving from song to song.
I sing more and I'm singing better. The more I sing, the better I
am. Singing is physical and emotional.''
   Golden said he's reluctant to sing ``Elvira'' any more.
   ``I just sang harmony on the chorus (with the Oak Ridge Boys).
It's a good song but I would feel funny singing it now. I enjoyed
singing it when we did it.''

<HEAD>Once Chairmanship Contender, Johnson Returns to Private Law
Practice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A General Motors Corp. executive vice president
and director who joined the company only five years ago and once
was considered a potential successor to the chairman has left the
automaker, GM says.
   Elmer W. Johnson, 56, resigned Monday from the board of
directors and retired as executive vice president in charge of GM's
legal, public affairs and operating staffs to return to the Chicago
law firm of Kirkland and Ellis.
   His departure was expected following several published reports
last week.
   One of the few outsiders to enter GM so near the top, Johnson
came to be known as a frustrated critic of the world's largest
manufacturer and its vast bureacracy because of its resistance to
change.
   Johnson engineered the departure of another well-known outsider,
Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot. Perot, founder of Electronic Data
Systems Corp., joined GM's board when he sold EDS to GM.
   Perot was GM's largest individual shareholder. He also become
one of its most vocal critics, and in late 1986, GM bought him out
for $750 million. Johnson was never as loud nor as public a critic
as Perot.
   Johnson, who became GM's general counsel, was elected an
executive vice president and director on May 22, 1987. GM Chairman
Roger Smith had indicated last year that Johnson was among
contenders for the chairmanship when Smith retires in 1990.
   ``Elmer Johnson has made significant and lasting contributions
to General Motors over the past five years,'' GM Chairman Roger
Smith said in a statement after Johnson resigned Monday at a board
meeting in New York.
   ``We will all miss our daily association with him and his
abilities,'' Smith said.
   In the same statement, Johnson said: ``My decision to retire
from General Motors was based on a number of considerations,'' but
didn't list any.
   ``Over the last five years GM has undergone a number of
extraordinary transactions. I'm glad that I had an opportunity to
contribute to the process,'' he said.
   William Hoglund, vice president in charge of GM's
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group, is considered most likely to
replace Johnson.
   But GM spokesman Bill Winters said no decisions had been made
and he did not know when any executive changes resulting from
Johnson's departure would be made. The next scheduled board meeting
is Aug. 1 in Detroit.
   Johnson's retirement benefits will consist of an annuity
beginning at age 65 based on his contributions to GM's salaried
retirement plan and any interest, Winters said.
   Johnson hadn't been with GM long enough to be eligible for the
full range of GM retiree benefits, Winters said.
   Analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities International in New
York said Johnson never had a clear shot at the chairmanship
because he was an outsider and he lacked automaking experience.
   ``Usually everybody at GM has been there since right out of
college. It's like a lifetime career,'' she said.
   In addition, Johnson was ``a little bit critical, said the
company wasn't moving fast enough. For him to have gotten Roger
Smith's job in 1990 would have been a real long shot,'' Heaney said.

<HEAD>Last Major Brewery In Illinois Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stag Brewery, the last remaining
full-sized brewery in Illinois and one of the oldest in the
Midwest, will close by fall, putting more than 200 people out of
work, company officials said.
   An official with G. Heileman Brewing Co., which owns Stag, said
Monday the plant was closing because of ``certain financial and
operational considerations.''
   The brewery dates back to the 1850s.
   ``This decision to end operations here is difficult in view of
the cooperation and support extended to us by the employees, the
labor unions, Mayor (Richard) Brauer's administration and the
community,'' said Charles Nicks, administrative manager at the
parent company.
   While company officials refused to discuss specific reasons, one
observer linked it to the location of Heileman's other Midwestern
breweries, the age of the plant and an enormous excess capacity.
   Robert F. Weinberg, an industry research specialist in St.
Louis, said Heileman used only 64 percent of the capacity of its
plants last year.
   ``The company has the capacity to brew 25.3 million barrels of
beer,'' Weinberg said. ``They shipped 16.25 million barrels last
year. Obviously, they decided they didn't need the Belleville
brewery's 1.1 million barrel capacity.''
   Nicks said about 230 employees will lose their jobs. Between 200
and 300 employees are employed by the brewery, depending on the
season.
   The remaining beer manufacturers in Illinois are classified as
``micro-breweries'' because they produce only limited amounts of
brew and serve it only on their own premises, rather than bottling
or canning it.

   AM International Inc. says it has tentatively
agreed to sell its Harris Graphics Web Press Group to a Japanese
printing company in a deal valued at around $250 million.
   Marion G. Durk, vice president of the Chicago company, said
Monday that AM International signed a letter of intent to sell the
unit to Komori Printing Machinery Co. of Tokyo.
   But he said the company would continue to hold discussions with
a number of other businesses that have shown an interest in buying
the division.
   Under the agreement, Komori would pay $181 million in cash and
assume $52 million in debt. The deal also calls for Komori to
transfer back to the company its 3.9 million common shares of AM
International.
   AM International said the sale of its graphics unit would allow
it to lower its debt, invest in new businesses and raise its
shareholder dividends.

   Eric Anthony looked over his farm one
year ago and saw his fields soaked with water from a summer flood.
   This year, he's thankful some of that water held in the ground,
for it may mean the difference between survival and disaster
brought on by the nation's worst drought in more than 50 years.
   Anthony grows soybeans and corn on his 1,400-acre farm west of
this north-central Ohio community in Morrow County.
   ``The flood seemed devastating last year, but it gave us a lot
of retained moisture,'' Anthony says. ``For every hole it drowned,
it made the others so much better.''
   Last July, the area was hit by flooding after up to 6 inches of
rain fell during 24 hours. The floods caused more than $20 million
in damage. The Ohio Disaster Services Agency estimated crop losses
at an additional $5.4 million.
   Crawford, Marion, Morrow and Richland counties were declared
eligible for federal disaster aid.
   A much bleaker picture faces farmers this year. Rainfall totals
since April 1 are as much as 6 inches below normal, and
agricultural officials have warned of heavy losses from the drought.
   Ohio's soil moisture is 93 percent short, and less than 20
percent of the corn and soy crops are rated as good or excellent,
state officials said Monday.
   Anthony said that although last year's flooding devastated the
area, it may have helped this season's rain-starved crops more than
is believed.
   Steve Ruhl, agricultural extension agent for Morrow County,
agreed.
   ``Our wells would be in a little better shape because of that
last year,'' Ruhl said Monday. ``At least, the ground was saturated
at one point last summer.''
   This season's sparse showers have done little more than keep
corn and bean plants alive. What rain the state has received hasn't
been enough to get much height out of crops, Anthony said.
   Corn stalks should be 8 feet by July 4, but most of his stalks
range from 5 inches to 1{ feet. He is not as worried about his
soybeans because he said they will sit until August and still grow
to their full height.
   Anthony said although the corn will mature despite its small
size, the ears will be smaller and the quality not as good.
   Anthony, a farmer for 18 years, said this is the worst drought
he has seen. He said many of his neighbors are depressed over the
loss of their crops.
   ``Wheat yields are going to be down significantly,'' Ruhl said.
``It looks like hay yields are down about a third of what we
normally would have.''
   Although Anthony said the outlook for this year's crop is not
good, he's not ready to give up.
   ``You have to wait on the end results,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rail Union Signs Agreement On Drug And Alcohol Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement between the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authoritity and the Brotherhood of
Railroad Signalmen allowing random drug testing of rail workers is
being hailed as the first of its kind in the country.
   Dave Murdoch, a SEPTA spokesman, said the agreement signed
Monday is the first in the country in which a rail union has agreed
to random drug testing. He stressed that the testing would ``not be
used as a dragnet.''
   The agreement also includes an employee assistance program with
educational components and Red Block, a nationally recognized
program in the rail industry which allows employees to refer other
employees for assistance.
   In January, a federal judge ruled railroad employees would not
be subject to random testing unless the individual rail labor
organizations agreed.
   ``With the support of my members, the signalmen initiated this
type of agreement for the safety of fellow employees and the safety
of the riding public,'' said BRS General Chairman Roland E.
McKenzie in a news release.
   ``My members have no fear of such tests and in the event a
member has a drug or alcohol related problem the agreement goes
further and addresses those needs providing rehabilitation help in
an accessible manner,'' McKenzie said.
   The program should be in operation by the fall.
   ``We would like to give credit and applaud the BRS for their
efforts and willingness to take a stand, which was obviously a
difficult one,'' James Kilcur, acting general manager of SEPTA said
in a press release.

   The stock market was little changed today amid
continuing worries about the outlook for interest rates and
inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .17 to 2,108.29
in the first half hour.
   Losers held a narrow lead over gainers in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 419 up, 463 down and
516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.39 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   As the day began, traders were faced with news of an increase in
British interest rates and an overnight decline in the dollar.
   Rates rose slightly in the U.S. credit markets. The dollar,
however, showed signs of steadying in foreign exchange.
   Analysts said investors remained concerned over the drought in
the Midwest after futures contracts for several basic farm
commodities jumped by their allowable daily limits on Monday.
   Strong upward pressure on food prices is seen as an inflationary
threat. But some observers say increased food costs will dampen
consumer demand for other, discretionary goods, thus mitigating the
overall impact on prices.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose ] to 125]; General Electric [ to 42}, and Exxon \ to
45.
   L.A. Gear gained 1\ to 32[ in the over-the-counter market. The
footwear producer reported sharply higher quarterly earnings.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.13 to 152.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .08 at 306.70.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 34.50 to
2,108.46.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by more than 5 to 2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 411 up, 1,088 down and 438 unchanged.
Big Board volume came to 264.41 million shares, against 179.88
million in the previous session.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange turned
slightly lower at midday Tuesday as the market ignored news of a
rise in British interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 1.8
points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,839.7 at 1 p.m. local time, little
changed from its level before the rate hikes.
   Trading volume was a low 220.6 million shares, compared with
203.6 million shares at the same time Monday.
   Dealers said the market was little affected by the news at
midday that the Bank of England, by raising a money-market
intervention rate of its own, signaled a rise in the commercial
banks' base lending rate to 9.5 percent from 9 percent. The banks
quickly responded.
   ``We moved a tickle easier but I don't think anyone changed a
single price,'' said one equity salesman.
   Dealers said the increase had been widely expected following the
release of trade data on Monday showing that Britain's merchandise
trade balance had widened sharply to a record 1.705 billion pounds,
or $2.9 billion dollars. Its current account trade gap also widened
to a record 1.205 billion pounds, or $2.05 billion.
   The trade figures drove equities sharply lower Monday, when the
100-share index fell 29.8 points, and led to a sharp decline in the
pound.
   ``There is a feeling in the market that a half-point rate hike
isn't enough to combat inflation problems,'' said one dealer.
   ``There's still pressure in the market for another rate hike to
10 percent,'' said another dealer.

   First RepublicBank Corp. says that a team of
officers from Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company,
is in Dallas studying a possible acquisition of the troubled bank.
   A First RepublicBank internal memo distributed Monday indicates
that about 20 Citicorp officials are examining First RepublicBank's
books and financial condition. Citicorp officials, though, have
declined to comment.
   First RepublicBank, the largest bank-holding company in Texas,
received a $1-billion bailout earlier this year from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. The bank has been plagued by sour real
estate loans.
   The Citicorp visit was arranged by the FDIC, which says it is
negotiating with a number of parties interested in acquiring First
RepublicBank with federal assistance.
   First RepublicBank Chairman Albert Casey told company employees
in the memo that several banks have ``expressed interest in First
RepublicBank to the FDIC. One of those organizations is New
York-based Citicorp.''
   But the Dallas Morning News reported Monday that one bank has
maintained a serious interest in acquiring First RepublicBank, and
some First Republic insiders told the Dallas Times-Herald that to
their knowledge Citicorp is the first bank to take an in-depth look
at the bank holding company.
   Along with the Citicorp team, 80 examiners from the FDIC
division of liquidation also are looking at First RepublicBank's
books.
   The FDIC says it expects to act shortly on the First
RepublicBank rescue and has set a June 30 deadline for potential
acquirers to submit their bids.
   Citicorp and First RepublicBank, if combined, would form one of
the 10 largest bank holding companies in the world.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
sharply lower today at the Chicago Board of Trade in a nervous
market concerned about possible rain in the Midwest.
   The possibility of rain in the major growing regions over the
next few days led to profit-taking after the market's recent
drought-driven rallies.
   ``There's a little bit of rain in the forecast and that makes
the bulls nervous,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But after dipping slightly at the opening, corn and soybean
futures strengthened on the underlying feeling that rainfall
amounts won't be enough to offer much relief to drought-stricken
crops.
   In early trading, wheat was 4{ cents to 14 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.86{ a bushel; corn was 4{ cents
to 12{ cents lower, with July at $3.40 a bushel; oats were 15 cents
higher across the board with December at $3.89\ a bushel; and
soybeans were 3{ cents to 18{ cents lower, with July at $10.41 a
bushel.
   Cattle and hog futures prices opened mixed at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .30 cent lower to .68 cent
higher, with the contract for delivery in August at 64.77 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .5 cent to .80 cent higher with August at
72.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .32 cent lower to .65 cent
higher with July at 45.95 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were .55 cent lower to 1.20 cents higher with July at 38.50 cents a
pound.
   Cattle and hog futures closed sharply higher in trading Monday.

   The arrival of summer has made stars of
Crocodile Mile, Jamball and Groove Tube.
   They are among the hottest toys of the season, entertaining
children and _ crucial for the recovering toy industry _ bringing
in sales for manufacturers.
   Summer toys are ``viewed as an area where the companies can
potentially get a stable base of revenues,'' said Paul Valentine,
who tracks the toy industry for Standard & Poor's Corp.
   Stability is exactly what toymakers want after the industry's
1987 washout, when manufacturers committed too much cash to
overambitious product lines that failed. Many big companies ended
up losing money.
   One bright spot last year _ last summer, in fact _ was Hasbro
Inc.'s Pogo Bal.
   The spherical toy, used like a pogo stick, was the hottest toy
of the season. For all of 1987, Hasbro sold 3 million Pogo Bals,
raking in an estimated $35 million in sales. And it's doing well
again in 1988.
   This has not been lost on other toymakers.
   ``The huge success of Pogo Bal last spring and summer led to
increased emphasis by the industry on these toys,'' said Valentine.
``Everyone jumped into the segment.''
   Analysts say there is no one single blockbuster summer toy in
1988. But ``summer toys and sports look quite strong,'' said Barry
Rothberg of the investment firm Mabon, Nugent & Co.
   The most popular summer toy this year, according to the
best-seller list compiled by the trade publication Toy & Hobby
World, is Coleco Industries Inc.'s Jamball, a game in which players
throw and catch a large orange ball without touching it.
   Toys R Us Inc., the nationwide toy store chain, reports
Crocodile Mile, a backyard water slide by Marchon, is selling well,
as is Groove Tube, a game involving a ball and a long plastic tube
produced by Hasbro's Milton Bradley division.
   Bubbles are big this year, so Dip Stix by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
and Fisher-Price's Bubble Mower are selling well, said Angela
Bourdon, a Toys R Us spokeswoman.
   But bicycles, which did well in 1988, have slipped. Huffy Corp.,
the Ohio-based manufacturer of Raleigh and Huffy bicycles, said it
has suffered a slowdown in sales in the second quarter.
   Barry Ryan, Huffy's vice president for finance, attributed the
slump in part to a possible saturation of the market after several
years of strong sales.
   In addition, Ryan said, ``Retailers just overbought and created
a logjam in the pipeline.''
   Kites, another summer standard, are again popular, including
Milton Bradley's Air America, Valentine said.
   So are jump ropes. At Worlds of Wonder Inc., which is undergoing
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, the
summer has been brightened by the success of Skipstik, a variation
on the jump rope.
   Struggling companies like Worlds of Wonder and Coleco, which is
trying to stay out of bankruptcy court, desperately need the
profits from their seasonal offerings. But the sad fact is, no
matter how successful such toys are, they're unlikely to turn the
companies around.
   The problem with summer toys is their lifespan is brief _ just a
few months _ and while they can help a company, they don't have the
kind of bottom-line impact of more timeless products.
   Even Pogo Bal's exceptional 1987 sales were ``far below what a
successful year-round toy would have done,'' Valentine said. In
contrast to Pogo Bal's $35 million in sales, the video game
Nintendo, the biggest toy of 1987, took in $750 million.
   It should also be noted that even with the popularity of
seasonal items, the top-selling toys are still the same ones that
occupied children during the winter.
   Nintendo took the No. 1 spot on Toy & Hobby World's list of
best-selling toys in May, the most recent month for which figures
are available. No. 2 was Mattel Inc.'s ever-popular Barbie doll,
followed in third place by the board game Pictionary, manufactured
by Games Gang Ltd.
   As was the case last year, there are no ``megahit'' toys on the
market like the Cabbage Patch Kids, Teddy Ruxpin or Lazer Tag that
had consumers jamming into stores in the past. But video games and
what are called basic toys _ such as board games, Barbie and
preschool toys _ are bringing the industry back.
   The third quarter, when Christmas toys are shipped, is the
biggest for the industry, and the one that will ultimately
determine how well the manufacturers do. But so far, the analysts
said, the business has a better tone than it did a year ago.
   ``The environment is getting better,'' said Rothberg, the Mabon,
Nugent analyst. ``(Product) movement is pretty good.''
   Steven Eisenberg, who tracks the industry for Bear Stearns &
Co., gave an industry forecast of ``reasonably healthy to possibly
very healthy for some of the larger companies.''
   In the meantime, the summer is proceeding ``right on
expectations,'' he said.

   The stock market turned upward today, recovering
some of Monday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 34.50 on Monday,

   A Virginia man who organized a haylift from Ohio to his
drought-stricken state two years ago plans to reciprocate, while
Fourth of July fireworks displays in Wisconsin were jeopardized by
the worst U.S. dry spell in 50 years.
   Parts of the parched South and southern Plains received rain
during the past few days, but except in Texas, it was not enough to
aid thirsty crops. Today's forecast called for more showers and
thunderstorms from the southern High Plains into Texas.
   Eugene Morris of Charlotte County, Va., said Monday he had
contacted farmers in the southern Virginia county in an effort to
help Ohio farmers who lack hay to feed their animals due to the
drought.
   ``We've got some hay lined up and we plan on doing what we can
to help the situation (in Ohio),'' said Morris, who works for the
soil conservation service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   Morris said the current drought was not as severe in southern
Virginia, and many growers had surplus hay. Alice Walters, a
spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Agriculture, said about
6,000 bales had been lined up.
   Four tractor-trailers and their drivers, donated by Goodyear
Tire & Rubber Co., will leave Akron on Wednesday to pick up the
hay, Ms. Walters said.
   In Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said Monday he would ban
private fireworks displays, open fires and even sparklers because
of tinder-dry conditions that have led to fires over thousands of
acres.
   Under the ban, which Thompson planned to sign today, local
governments and the state may make exceptions where conditions
allow. Also exempted will be community fireworks displays, but only
where adequate fire prevention measures are taken.
   Several Cleveland area suburbs said they may cancel public
fireworks this Fourth of July weekend.
   ``If we get rain Wednesday or Thursday, we'll be all right,''
Berea Mayor Stanley J. Trupo said Monday. ``If not, I'll cancel on
Thursday.''
   Some officials in Iowa also planned to restrict fireworks.
   ``It wouldn't be a popular move. A lot of people say let's take
a chance, but I don't know who would take the responsibility if
anything happened,'' said Dennis Ballou, fire chief of Exira, Iowa.
   A heat wave gripping St. Paul, Minn., appears to be behind an
unusually high number of no-shows at donation centers and at
Bloodmobile stops, a Red Cross official said.
   ``We see a shrinking and we know darn well we can't go on like
this without getting into serious trouble,'' Dr. Robert Bowman,
medical director of the St. Paul Regional Red Cross Blood Services,
said Monday.
   ``It's clearly the worst I've seen this early,'' Bowman said of
blood inventories, which normally are lower in summer months. ``The
part that worries me is that we're already in the shape we didn't
expect to be in until mid-summer.''
   Texas' South Plains and Panhandle received 1-2 inches of rain
over the weekend and Monday, providing relief just when the ground
was beginning to dry out, said county agents.
   ``It's a shame that somebody else has to suffer before someone
else makes a crop,'' said Bob Benson, Hale County's extension
agent. ``A few years ago we were in a drought and the Midwest was
laughing off with good prices. But that's just the cold, hard facts
of farming.''
   In Alabama, weekend thunderstorms gave parched crops a temporary
boost, but officials said steady rain was needed.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., toured farms that had received a
soaking, but he said the fields were still the worst he'd ever seen.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus toured drought-stricken areas of his
state Monday and called for greater government relief efforts.
   Asked if President Reagan was moving too slowly, Mabus said, ``I
wish he would come down and see the things I have seen.''
   Cool weather moved into parts of the upper Midwest on Monday,
but officials said that would do little to alleviate drought damage.
   Hot weather continued in the Plains and the South.
   Highs in the 80s and 90s were expected to continue across the
nation's midsection and South, except for the upper Great Lakes
region and the upper Ohio Valley, where 60s and 70s were expected.
   Barge traffic flowed again Monday on most of the low-water
Mississippi River after the Army Corps of Engineers dredged out
channels near St. Louis, Mo., and Memphis, Tenn. But there were new
blockages as barges ran aground near Memphis.
   Fire lines were completed Monday around a 57,000-acre blaze
along the Montana-South Dakota line, but authorities did not
declare it contained. Smaller fires were fought in Wyoming, Idaho
and Southern California.
   The scientist who popularized the ``greenhouse effect'' theory
said he believes the drought is not a symptom of the gradual
warming of the atmosphere he predicted as a result of air pollution.
   Stephen Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colo., said he believes the drought more
likely was caused by the jet stream swinging well north of its
usual track this year, ``depriving the middle of the country of
rain (and) leaving hot weather in the South.''

   The government charged today that the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters is dominated by organized
crime and sued to force free elections and other reforms in the
nation's largest union.
   Organized crime's ``control is so pervasive that for decades the
IBT's leadership has permitted La Cosa Nostra figures to dominate
and corrupt important Teamsters locals, joint councils and benefit
funds,'' claimed court papers filed with the suit.
   ``The government's complaint alleges that organized crime has
deprived union members of their rights through a pattern of
racketeering that includes 20 murders, a number of shootings,
bombings, beatings, a campaign of fear, extortion and theft ...''
said U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in a prepared statement.
   Teamsters President Jackie Presser, currently under indictment
in Cleveland, and the union's other top 17 officials were named as
defendants, as were 26 alleged Mafia members or associates
including the alleged heads of six mob families.
   The government wants a federal judge to remove from office any
Teamsters officers found at trial to have violated federal
racketeering laws, and is seeking appointment of a union trustee to
ensure free and fair union elections.
   The civil racketeering lawsuit, in preparation for more than a
year, was filed at federal court in Manhattan by Giuliani.
   Prosecutors charged that the Mafia ``has gained control over''
the union and ``now uses the IBT and many of its affiliated
entities to engage in racketeering activity.''
   The government used a similar suit two years ago under the
Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act to put Teamsters
Local 560 in New Jersey under the control of a government-appointed
trustee.
   Presser is on temporary leave from the union after undergoing
surgery last month for a brain tumor. In his absence,
Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis is serving as acting president.
   Anticipation of the suit prompted the 1.6-million-member union
to seek refuge with the AFL-CIO last October, rejoining the labor
federation after a 30-year absence.
   Among those named in the suit were convicted crime family bosses
Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno of the Genovese group; Anthony ``Tony
Ducks'' Corallo of the Luccheses and Carmine ``Junior'' Persico of
the Colombo family. All three were convicted in 1986 of sitting on
the U.S. Mafia's ruling ``commission.''
   Salerno, 77, also was convicted last month, in another massive
rackets case, of bid rigging in New York's construction industry,
but the same jury acquitted Salerno and two others of rigging the
election of Presser and his predecessor, Roy Williams.

<HEAD>Leaders Push for Quick Vote on Plant-Closings Notice Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, moving to vote on the
controversial plant-closure bill this week, agreed today that
employers need not give strikers 60 days' notice they are being
laid off.
   An amendment by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, including that
exemption was approved 91-0.
   President Reagan last month vetoed a massive trade bill
primarily because of the mandatory-notice provision. The issues has
become a major domestic political issue in this year's election.
   Marjority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., made it clear Monday
that he wants final congressional votes on the legislation before
lawmakers leave town to spend July 4th on the hustings.
   The same urgency was expressed on the House side, where Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, said his chamber would vote in fairly quick
succession Wednesday on the plant-closing legislation and then on
the 1,000-page omnibus trade bill.
   Byrd said he had hoped for a Senate vote today but to be on the
safe side he took steps to invoke cloture, or halt debate, if that
were needed to bring the matter to a vote later in the week.
   The plant-closing measure, newly detached from the trade bill,
would require companies with at least 100 employees to provide
advance notice of large-scale layoffs and plant closings. President
Reagan singled it out for special criticism in his May 24 veto of
the trade legislation.
   Reagan said it would rob managers of flexibility needed to
operate their companies at peak economic health. Proponents say
advance notice is the only decent way to treat breadwinners facing
layoffs.
   The Senate on Monday voted 64-32 to kill a move by Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., to drop advance notice of layoffs from the bill.
   Critics said the overall bill was too broad and that dropping
the layoff provision represented one way to impose limits.
   ``A layoff of 50 employees at a 10,000-employee manufacturing
plant would not be a plant closing to most people but it is under
terms of this legislation,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, called the plan a ``blueprint
for employers who want to disobey the plant-closings law itself.''
   ``Employers would simply lay them off, piece by piece, bit by
bit, until there was nothing left,'' Metzenbaum said.
   The plant-closing provision was dropped from the trade bill and
reconstituted as a separate piece of legislation after the Senate
was unable to override Reagan's trade bill veto.
   Labor unions have been seeking plant-closing legislation in one
form or another for 15 years.
   Reagan is expected to veto the legislation if, as seems likely,
it reaches his desk in its new, stand-alone form.
   The trade bill was initially viewed as an ideal vehicle to
propel the plant-closing provision through Congress. But sponsors
are now saying that they might have a better chance to override a
veto without being tied to the numerous other controversies in the
trade bill.

<HEAD>Pencils Poised Over Takeover Hit Lists</HEAD>

   Corporate takeover artists have their pencils
poised, ready to tick off names of targets. Expansion-oriented
companies have their own acquisition plans, and executives nervous
about low stock prices are mulling restructurings.
   But the looming question is just who is on these secret hit
lists for the latter half of 1988, a period ripe for fast-paced
buyouts.
   A relatively cheap dollar is expected to keep luring foreign
investors, while a fear of tighter regulations in the post-Reagan
era should keep domestic-led takeovers rolling.
   Topping it off is a plethora of companies whose share prices
remain depressed in the wake of October's stock market bloodbath,
rendering them relative bargains.
   Most Wall Streeters covet such opportunities and are more than
reluctant to point fingers at potential takeover or restructuring
targets.
   ``People pay us for our opinions,'' said one analyst at Bear
Stearns & Co., ``so I don't want to give them to you for nothing.''
   But the grapevine is abuzz with names like Texaco, Whirlpool,
American Brands, McGraw-Hill and plenty more.
   Using a purely numerical approach to identify targets, Linda
Zimbalist Smith said she searches for stocks that would jump in a
takeover, restructuring or leveraged buyout. And while a company
may appear on her list today, a few ticks upward in its stock price
could render it undesirable in an instant, according to her complex
formula.
   In May, Smith, head of the Greenwich, Conn.-based research firm
Zimbalist Smith, named 28 target companies _ including American
Brands, Monsanto, Whirlpool, Goodyear and Zayre _ but many of these
companies no longer pass her test.
   Still, experts remain keen on American Brands, a company with
far-flung interests from tobacco to biscuits.
   ``It is one of the ultimate consumer conglomerates, with dozens
of separate companies pasted together without any synergy,'' noted
Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   That means the company's separate parts could be spun off or
sold to finance a takeover or pay shareholders a handsome dividend.
For the investor, a takeover is not the only way to cash out. Any
kind of restructuring or leveraged buyout is designed to boost
shareholder value and put profits in the pockets of investors.
   Smith conceded that American Brand's break-up value is great and
that its stock price is hampered by the cloud hanging over the
tobacco industry.
   A depressed stock price alone is not the only red flag on a
potential target. Internal forces, such as low debt levels coupled
with higher projected earnings, also can highlight target companies.
   ``You have to look at the financials of a company, the cash
flow, the balance sheet, and you have to look outside directors,
whether they are friends of management,'' said Metz.
   Anti-takeover provisions are likely to be only a slight
deterrent to takeover offers.
   There are even more subtle issues to consider. ``We look for
values as well as a catalyst,'' said Mario Gabelli, who heads the
investment firm Gabelli & Co.
   Among his so-called catalysts are ``things like divorce, death,
big blocks of stock in the hands of octogenarians.''
   For example, Gabelli said he is buying lots of stock in Thomas
Industries Inc., a Kentucky-based lighting manufacturer. The
company's founder, Lee B. Thomas, died in March, and a spokesman
said he does not know what became of Thomas's stake in the company.
   Newell Co., an Illinois home hardware concern, apparently also
likes Thomas. Newell has picked up a 6.5 percent stake in the
company and could serve as an important ally to a potential suitor
_ if it does not make a bid of its own.
   Divorce is taking its toll on R.P. Scherer Corp. Karla Scherer
Fink, who has filed suit to divorce the company's president, has
said she wants to sell the pharmaceuticals company in which she
holds a 33 percent stake. One investor group that controls more
than 13 percent of the company has already held talks with her and
may be jockeying for an acquisition.
   If internal strife is a major criteria, nowhere is such a force
more evident that at Texaco Inc. Despite defeating raider Carl C.
Icahn in a critical proxy battle, the oil giant remains vulnerable.
   Icahn's 14.9 percent stake may be for sale, giving any purchaser
a solid springboard for an offer. In addition, the aggressive New
York investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., which sided
with management in the proxy battle, conceivably could push for a
leveraged buyout and retain Texaco management, with whom they
likely have established a working rapport, Oppenheimer's Metz said.
   One deal often turns the spotlight on an entire industry. ``It
starts a conflagration, and investors and speculators look to
mirror images and clones to see if other potential vehicles could
go the same way,'' Metz said.
   Turmoil at Texaco has turned up the heat on other oil companies,
in particular Unocal Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co. Both are
``selling at large discounts considering their break-up value as
well as in terms of cash flow and the value of underlying gas and
oil reserves,'' Metz said.
   In the publishing industry, MacMillan Inc.'s announced
recapitalization as a defensive measure against offers from the
Robert Bass group has sparked rumors that Time Inc. or McGraw-Hill
Inc. might also be pressed to restructure.
   And General Electric Co.'s acquisition of Roper Corp. turned
fresh attention to the home appliance market. Since then there has
been plenty of talk about Whirlpool Corp. and fellow appliance
maker Maytag Corp., including rumors that Whirlpool might make a
bid for Maytag.
   Not all undervalued companies are targets. Most drug companies,
for example, are trading at a discount but are not choice
candidates. Metz noted that these companies are undervalued in part
because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of government
health insurance plans and because the revived dollar will not
benefit their overseas sales as it did in the previous year.
   But Smithkline Beckman Corp. is one pharmaceutical company whose
stock is so downright depressed it just might be attractive.
Smithkline's stock recently plummeted from about $54 a share to the
$45 range after the company revised its earnings projections
downward.
   Because of Eastman Kodak Co.'s megapurchase of Sterling Drug
Inc. earlier this year, Zimbalist Smith has the company on her
``watch list.''
   ``It's in line to do something to boost its stock price, and
there's a lot it can do'' now that it has more pieces to sell off,
she said.

<HEAD>Edelman Denied Information For Possible Payless Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group led by New York
financier Asher Edelman complained Tuesday that Payless Cashways
Inc. refused to provide information in connection with a possible
takeover bid for the building materials retailer.
   Edelman's group twice requested information used by Payless
senior management to formulate the $26-a-share bid they offered
last week to take the company private in an $875 million leveraged
buyout.
   Edelman spokesman Corey Horowitz said the group received a
letter Friday denying the information. He did not say why the
request was denied.
   ``We believe the failure to give us the information is unfair
and without legal precedent,'' Horowitz said. ``It certainly works
to the detriment of the shareholders.''
   Payless officials confirmed the letter was sent but declined
further comment.
   The Edelman group, which once held a 9.9 percent stake in
Payless and said it might make a bid for the entire company, now
controls about 8.1 percent of the company's 33.6 million
outstanding shares.
   In addition to Edelman, the group also includes Payless
competitor Sutherland Lumber Southwest Inc., also of Kansas City.
   Payless spokeswoman Brenda Nolte declined comment on whether the
board's special committee had received other bids or has acted on
the management officials' leveraged buyout offer.
   Separately, two Payless shareholders filed suit Monday in
Jackson County Circuit Court against Payless Chairman and Chief
Executive David Stanley, Larry Kunz, the president, and the board
of directors.
   The suit contends that the defendants are ``carrying out a
preconceived plan to eliminate the public common stockholders of
Payless at a grossly inadequate price.''
   The shareholders _ Robert Gillespie of Westtown, Pa., and Terry
Shickler of New York _ also contend that the primary objective of
the management buy-out is to allow those involved to acquire
Payless at a ``fraudulently low and unfair price.''

<TEXT>
   Britain's commercial banks, heeding a signal from
the Bank of England, on Tuesday announced a half percentage point
increase in their base lending rate to 9.5 percent.
   A rise in the benchmark lending rate, the fourth this month, was
expected following a government report Monday of a sharply wider,
record merchandise trade deficit, which sent the pound and the
London stock market reeling.
   The report, and the markets' reaction, fueled speculation that
the government would push up interest rates to cool the economy's
growth, by discouraging consumer buying, and to counter inflation.
   Some analysts had expected the central bank to go as far as
signaling a one percentage point gain. Another half-point increase
might follow shortly, analysts said.
   The central bank signaled the half-point increase at midday by
raising a key money market intervention rate of its own.
   Major banks, such as Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC,
National Westminster Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC, announced they
were increasing their rate. The banks also increased the base
lending rate half a percentage point on June 2, June 6 and June 22.
   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at a percentage point above
the base rate.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit soared to a record 1.705
billion pounds, or $2.9 billion, in May, with imports running at
their highest level since last summer, the government said in its
Monday report.
   The pound, which plummeted 4 cents Monday to $1.7030 from
$1.7430, was quoted at $1.7260 after the rate increases Tuesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down
around 3 points at the 1,838 level by midday Tuesday. It fell 29.8
points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,841.5 in the previous session.

   Share prices rose Tuesday after investors were
pleasantly surprised by a smaller-than-expected hike in a benchmark
British interest rate.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index gained 15.4
points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,856.9.
   Trading volume totaled 386.7 million shares, compared with
Monday's 390.7 million shares.
   The market was initially little affected by the midday news that
the Bank of England signaled a rise in the commercial banks' base
lending rate to 9.5 percent from 9.0 percent. But investors soon
became heartened that the increase had only been a half-point, and
not a full point as had been widely expected in the market.
   An advance on Wall Street added a bit of upward stimulus to
rising London equities, dealers said.
   Charles Larkum, equity analyst with James Capel & Co., said the
market's rise was ``an expression of relief.''
   The widely anticipated rate increase followed a government
report Monday that showed the Briitsh merchandise trade deficit
widened sharply to a record 1.705 billion pounds, or $2.9 billion,
in May, while its current account gap also widened to a record
1.205 billion pounds.
   The trade figures drove equities and the pound sharply lower on
Monday.

   Corn and soybean futures prices plummeted to
their daily limits Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a wild
reversal based on concerns that rain may fall across the Midwest
and bring relief to drought-stricken crops.
   ``That dirty word was being heard on the floor today, r-a-i-n.
Not a lot, just a little bit, but that's all it takes to scare
anybody,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``That caused massive liquidation,'' he said, among buyers in
the corn and soybean pits who had been anticipating the drought
would continue to damage crops and tighten supplies.
   Those were the same traders who a day earlier had pushed prices
up the limit in expectation of another hot, dry forecast.
   Corn prices closed down the daily limit _ expanded Tuesday to 15
cents a bushel _ in all but two months; while soybeans fell the
expanded 45-cents-a bushel limit in all months except November 1989.
   ``We're at a turning point here,'' Lespinasse said, as nobody
knows the impact rains forecast for the next few days over much of
the Midwest will have on thirsty crops.
   ``Everybody's scared to death because of that dirty word,'' he
said.
   At the close, wheat was .22{ cent to .28{ cent lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.73 a bushel; corn was .01{ cent
to .15 cent lower with July at $3.37{ a bushel; oats were .15 cent
lower across the board with July at $3.63 a bushel; and soybeans
were .26 cent to .45 cent lower with July at $10.14{ a bushel.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of new construction projects rose 9
percent in May, reversing a declining trend, according to a report
released Tuesday.
   But the improvement, which translated to an annualized $246.4
billion in new construction projects, was dominated by a cluster of
major, non-building projects, said the F.W. Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co.
   General construction activity, which includes housing and
commercial buildings, was up only slightly from the previous month
and still held below last year's levels.
   The contract statistics measure the value of newly started
construction that will be completed in the upcoming months. They
indicate the amount and direction of future expenditures of the
building industry.
   George Christie, F.W. Dodge vice president and chief economist,
called the surge in contracting ``an isolated event affecting a
narrow slice of the construction sector'' and not a turnaround.
   He noted that commercial building markets ``remain overbuilt,
public funding is under restraint and homeuilding is vulnerable to
rising interest rates.''
   Contracting for nonbuilding construction leaped 30 percent to an
annualized $52.9 billion in May, largely on the strength of three
major projects: a fuel processing plant in Idaho, an oil products
distribution center in California and a New Jersey waste-to-energy
facility.
   Nonresidential building construction rose 3 percent to an
annualized $79.4 billion, while the value of newly started
residential buildings rose 4 percent to an annualized $114 billion.
   Christie attributed the weak showing in the nonresidential
sector to ``acceleration of the office building cutback,'' which
had been confined to a few regions but now is becoming a national
trend.
   He also noted that higher interest rates might make doubtful the
``prospect of achieving a total of 1.5 million housing starts this
year.''
   For the year to date, construction contracts totaled $97.8
billion, down 2 percent from the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>American Airlines to Buy Simmons for $78 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines' parent said Tuesday
it has entered an agreement to acquire Simmons Airlines, the
fourth-largest regional carrier in the country.
   AMR Corp. said its subsidiary, AMR Eagle-Central, has signed an
agreement to purchase Simmons for $17.50 a share, or a total of
about $78 million.
   Under the agreement, AMR Eagle-Central will commence a cash
tender offer within five days for all of the outstanding shares of
Simmons. The board of directors of Simmons has unanimously approved
the agreement, officials said.
   Since Oct. 1, 1985, Chicago-based Simmons has been an American
Eagle commuter partner of American Airlines, providing service in
the Great Lakes region. Simmons will continue in that role after
the acquisition, the two companies said.
   American officials said the purchase makes sound business sense.
   ``We think it was just a smart business decision. The company
was for sale and we think that by applying the marketing expertise
and financial strengths of American Airlines, we can do a much
better job of operating the company, although it was doing a fine
job for us as a partner of American Eagle,'' said American
spokesman Al Becker.
   Simmons, founded in 1978, operates about 350 weekday departures
from 34 airports in seven states.
   American spokesman Steve McGregor said Simmons employs about
1,500 workers and owns 28 percent of the commuter slots at
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, its major feeder point.

   Stock prices rallied in light trading today,
rebounding from Monday's broad decline.
   As the day began, traders were faced with news of an increase in
British interest rates and an overnight decline in the dollar.
   The dollar, however, showed signs of steadying in foreign
exchange as the day passed. Interest rates in the U.S. credit
markets headed lower after an initial rise.
   Analysts said investors remained concerned over the drought in
the Midwest after futures contracts for several basic farm
commodities jumped by their allowable daily limits on Monday.
   Strong upward pressure on food prices is seen as an inflationary
threat. But some observers say increased food costs will dampen
consumer demand for other, discretionary goods, thus mitigating the
overall impact on prices.

<HEAD>Deadline Extended For Bass Takeover Of S&L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials on Tuesday extended the
negotiating deadline for Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass in his
effort to take over the troubled American Savings and Loan
Association, the nation's second largest thrift.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the S&L
industry, had announced on April 21 that it would negotiate
exclusively with the Robert M. Bass Group for a period of 75 days,
ending on July 5.
   But the bank board said that because of the ``complexity of the
transaction,'' it would extend the deadline until Aug. 1. The
agency said that substantial progress had been made in the
negotiations and the extension did not reflect any problems.
   The bank board has been trying for more than a year to find a
rescuer for American Savings, which currently has about $30 billion
in assets. However, its liabilities exceeded its assets by $106
million at the end of 1987.
   American Savings, based in Stockton, Calif., is the main unit of
Financial Corp. of America of Irvine, Calif.
   Sources have said that the proposed deal would require the Bass
Group to pump in several hundred million dollars of new capital and
for the bank board to provide at least several hundred million
dollars of federal assistance.
   The bank board said that its assurances to protect depositors
and general creditors of American Savings would remain in force
during the extension of the negotiating period.

   The stock market staged a rally in subdued
trading Tuesday, recovering much of Monday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 34.50 points on
Monday, rebounded 22.41 to 2,130.87.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
965 up, 530 down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.37 million
shares, down from 264.41 million in the previous session, when the
total was inflated by dividend-related activity in several
high-yielding stocks.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 175.25 million shares.
   As the day began, traders were faced with news of an increase in
British interest rates and an overnight decline in the dollar.
   But the dollar bounced back in foreign exchange as the day
passed. Interest rates in the U.S. credit markets headed lower
after an initial rise.
   Analysts said investors remained concerned over the drought in
the Midwest after futures contracts for several basic farm

   Strong upward pressure on food prices is seen as an inflationary
threat. However, some observers say increased food costs will
dampen consumer demand for other, discretionary goods, thus
mitigating the overall impact on prices.
   In any case, futures prices tumbled Tuesday amid talk of an
increased chance for rain in the Farm Belt.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
Tuesday but was restrained against European currencies by the
dollar sales of central banks.
   Gold prices fell to their lowest levels since early March as
inflation fears receded. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $437.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$442.60 an ounce late Monday.
   By the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar was lower
against the British pound and French franc, slightly higher against
some other European currencies and sharply higher against the yen.
   The dollar was knocked down in Europe through concerted
dollar-selling by the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland,
Belgium, France and other nations, but it bounced back as soon as
the central banks dropped out of the market.
   Traders used the brief drop as a buying opportunity and the
dollar rose in trading that turned into ``a bit of a panic,'' said
James Hohorst, managing director of foreign exchange for
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The Federal Reserve later dampened the rally somewhat by selling
dollars for a second consecutive day, but demand remained strong,
traders said.
   ``When the Fed came in, the market said, `How many do you want
to sell? We'll take them,''' said David H. Arbesman, president of
Kemper Currency Inc.
   Central banks, which generally refuse to comment on
intervention, were unusually open about Tuesday's move. The Swiss,
Belgian and French central banks all confirmed their participation.
   ``We wanted to slow the pace of the developments in the market
and give the market a certain breathing space to think about where
the dollar should be going,'' said a spokesman for the Swiss
National Bank.
   The rise was sharpest against the yen because the Bank of Japan
showed no signs of intervening against the dollar, traders said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 130.95 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 130.80 yen. At the end of the trading day
in New York, the dollar rose to 132.74 yen from 131.14 late Monday.
   The pound recovered despite the Bank of England's decision to
trigger a rise in the British commercial banks' base lending rate
that was smaller than expected.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.7200 from $1.7030 late Monday.
Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.7085 from $1.7025 late
Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8220 West German marks, up from 1.8216; 1.5080
Swiss francs, up from 1.5078; 1.2097 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2063; 6.1340 French francs, down from 6.1483; and 1,352.50
Italian lire, up from 1,351.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8070 West German marks, down from 1.8185; 1.4960
Swiss francs, down from 1.5050; 6.0885 French francs, down from
6.1385; 2.0210 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0460; 1,337.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,353.48; and 1.2105 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2075.
   Gold prices fell in reaction to an overall mood that inflation
fears had been exaggerated, said Sharon Ziemian, senior marketing
manager for precious metals at Citibank.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.16 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$446.30 an ounce.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $443.20 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $441.50. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $443.20 a troy ounce, compared with $443 late Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $437.50 a troy ounce, down from $443 an ounce late
Monday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market. Silver traded
at a late bid price of $6.92 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's
$6.84. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
fell to $6.757 an ounce from $6.936 an ounce late Monday.

<HEAD>Belzbergs Ordered To Pay Penalties On Trading Profits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a holding company
owned by Canada's Belzberg family to pay $476,000 in interest
penalties on the $2.7 million in stock trading profits it must
forfeit for violating federal securities law.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker, in an order issued last
Friday, gave First City Financial Corp. Ltd. five days to surrender
the profits from its unsuccessful attempt to takeover Ashland Oil
Co. in 1986.
   The interest penalty was assessed as part of the final judgment
that Parker entered in favor of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which brought the complaint against the Belzberg family
company.
   Earlier this month, Parker ruled that the Vancouver-based
company and Marc Belzberg, a vice president, violated the 1934
Securities Exchange Act by concealing ownership of Ashland stock.
   Parker found that First City's failure to publicly disclose
ownership of its 5 percent stake in the oil company was intended to
prevent the price of Ashland stock from soaring while the company
continued to buy more shares in the oil company.
   First City sold its 890,100 shares back to Ashland for $51 a
share after the takeover bid was thwarted.
   The company has said it will appeal Parker's ruling that it
violated the disclosure provisions of the 1934 securities law.

<HEAD>NYSE Fines Hutton in Check Overdraft Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.F. Hutton & Co. has been fined $400,000 and
censured by the New York Stock Exchange in connection with the
firm's 1985 check overdraft scandal, the NYSE announced Tuesday.
   Two former Hutton officers, President George L. Ball and
Executive Vice President Thomas P. Lynch, the company's chief
financial officer, also were censured, the NYSE said in a statement.
   A censure is one of the mildest forms of sanctions the exchange
can impose on members. The NYSE's action against Hutton and the
former executives had been expected for some time.
   The hearing panel found that from 1980 to 1982, Hutton failed to
supervise and control its cashiering operations and several areas
of its business operations, the NYSE said.
   The hearing panel also found Hutton had ``engaged in conduct
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade'' through
the overdraft scheme, which the exchange said deprived banks of
their property because Hutton did not pay interest on the funds it
used.
   Hutton, Ball and Lynch consented to the findings of an exchange
hearing panel without admitting or denying guilt, the NYSE said.
   The exchange's investigation stemmed from a 1985
check-overdrafting scheme that Hutton orchestrated through its
retail brokerage network. The firm earned up to $8 million in
interest income at commercial banks by deliberately overdrawing
checking accounts and putting the money to use elsewhere.
   Hutton pleaded guilty to 2,000 federal fraud counts and paid a
$2 million fine in May 1985 because of the scheme, which exposed
serious management lapses at the firm and led to a chain of events
that forced Hutton to sell itself to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
late last year. The merged firm is known as Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   In a report on the disciplinary actions, the NYSE said there was
no evidence that Ball, now the chairman of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., or Lynch had been aware of excessive overdrafting
before February 1982 but should have questioned whether there was
adequate supervision and control over branch offices.
   The $400,000 fine is among the largest levied by the stock
exchange. In 1981, the NYSE fined First Wall Street Settlement
$400,000 and in 1982, it fined Bache Halsey Stuart Shields the same
amount.
   The NYSE routinely disciplines member firms for violating its
rules of conduct, with punitive actions ranging from expulsions for
severe infractions to fines or censure for less serious offenses.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices advanced broadly Tuesday, as a surge
in the dollar and a decline in commodity prices dampened inflation
fears.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose by more than a full
point, or $10 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield fell to
8.85 percent from 8.96 percent late Monday. The closely-watched
bond fell more than $10 on Monday.
   Analysts said the market appeared to be impressed that the
dollar continued its rise despite concerted intervention by central
banks.
   The dollar's appreciation has made dollar-denominated
securities, such as U.S. Treasury bonds and notes, more attractive
to foreign investors.
   Bonds also benefitted from a decline in the Commodity Research
Bureau's index, which fell 3.32 points after rising more than 5
points on Monday.
   Nonetheless, some analysts such as Harold Nathan of Wells Fargo
& Co. in San Francisco remain skeptical that the bond rally will
continue.
   Nathan said he expects that the central banks in West Germany
and Japan may boost their base lending rates in support of their
currencies, and that could depress foreign demand for U.S. bonds.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 5-32 point, intermediate maturities were up
by between 5-16 point and 23-32 point and 20-year issues rose a
full point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 4.59 to 1,152.02. The Merrill Lynch Bond
Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 0.48 to 110.09.
   Corporate bonds also were slightly higher today. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.88 to 284.38.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices were steady, according to the
Bond Buyer Municipal Index.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 2 basis points to 6.59
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 1 basis point to 6.73 percent and one-year
bills fell 3 basis points to 7.01 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7| percent, up from 7 9-16
percent late Monday.

<HEAD>Board Approves Sale of Shuttered Flint Body Plant to Office
Developers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. directors approved the
sale of the shuttered, gutted Flint Body assembly plant to a pair
of Detroit developers who specialize in making use of old
factories, GM said Tuesday.
   GM will sell the plant, which closed Dec. 10, to the partnership
of Ralph Vigliotti Realty Inc. and J.C. Miller Construction Co.,
said J.T. Battenberg III, GM vice president and product manager of
the Flint Automotive Division.
   The partnership plans to convert the historic plant, known for
decades as Fisher 1, into the Great Lakes Technology Center Inc., a
complex of offices, light industrial manufacturing, retail shops
and restaurants.
   The price of the sale was not disclosed. The sale was approved
Monday by GM's board of directors at a meeting in New York,
Battenberg said.
   Thomas Vigliotti and Miller said they will complete the purchase
only if the Flint City Council grants an immediate tax break. The
plant is in a special district where developers can receive breaks
for up to 12 years on the improvements they make.
   ``If they're going to tax it at a top rate, we won't do it,''
Vigliotti said.
   GM's Flint Automotive Division plans to lease about a half
million square feet of the plant for its engineering and materials
management complex, which will house engineers and staffs now
scattered in offices in Troy and Flint.
   The Flint Automotive Division is responsible for the
development, design, engineering and manufacture of large, luxury,
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac models such as the Cadillac Fleetwood,
Oldsmobile 98 and Buick Park Avenue.
   Many of the 600 Flint Automotive Division employees in Troy,
along with 700 in Flint, will be moved to the plant after its
renovation is completed in December 1989.
   Vigliotti and Miller expect about 2,500 people will eventually
work at the renovated plant. About 3,000 GM workers lost their jobs
when it closed late last year, the last body-only GM assembly plant
in the United States.

   The Senate on Tuesday agreed to exempt
businesses affected by the Farm Belt drought from legislation to
make employers provide 60 days advance notice of large layoffs and
plant closings.
   The amendment by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., was
approved unanimously after farm state lawmakers said they have been
told by bakeries, flour mills and meatpacking, poultry, egg,
ethanol and farm equipment plants they anticipate future layoffs
resulting from the drought currently afflicting much of the country.
   ``I don't think we ought to get carried away by the demands from
organized labor,'' Dole said. ``If we're serious about alleviating
the effects of the drought on the economy, then we ought not to be
hitting businesses with both barrels.''
   Meanwhile, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., filed
motions for three more votes to cut off debate on the plant closing
measure _ now in its fifth day _ and threatened to hold lawmakers
in session the rest of this week or most of next week.
   ``We're going to pass this bill sooner or later, it's
inevitable,'' Byrd said. ``If necessary, we'll stay here until 9
o'clock every night until we do it.''
   Dole denied that Republicans were trying to delay final action
but admitted both sides are playing ``hard-ball politics'' on it.
   ``I don't know precisely what's happening myself,'' Dole said of
a string of Republican amendments, many of them approved
unanimously Tuesday but some of them rejected.
   Byrd admitted he does not have the 60 votes necessary to end the
debate and bring the bill to a final vote Wednesday.
   But Republicans leading the opposition to the layoff notices
indicated they may throw in the towel Wednesday, particularly after
Byrd threatened to cut short a July Fourth holiday that many
senators on both sides planned to spend in their home states
campaigning for re-election.
   ``I think we can finish plant closing by tomorrow,'' Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, the chief Republican opponent of the legislation,
replied when asked about Byrd's carrot-stick offer.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the House would likely
vote on the bill Thursday, assuming the Senate approves it before
recessing Wednesday night.
   Meanwhile, the House Rules Committee delayed acting on a revised
trade bill that President Reagan vetoed last month largely because
it included the plant-closing notification requirements.
   Democratic leaders, fulfilling a promise to the nation's labor
leaders, have agreed to delay final congressional action on the
trade bill until after first acting on the plant closing and layoff
notices.
   Wright also had hoped to win passage of the trade bill before
the House recesses Thursday.
   However, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, a chief author of the
trade measure, said Tuesday he doesn't anticipate Senate action on
it until August _ after Congress has had a chance to override
Reagan's expected veto of the plant-closing bill but before the
Republican National Convention.
   Without a separate plant-closing law, AFL-CIO officials have
vowed to withdraw what congressional supporters of the trade bill
agree is organized labor's pivotal backing of it.
   House and Senate Republican leaders met Tuesday with Reagan at
the White House, where officials said they continue to recommend
that he veto ``any mandatory notice legislation.''
   But opposition among some Republicans and a few one-time
Democratic opponents of the measure appeared to be softening.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Small Business
Committee, had opposed the notifications in two previous Senate
votes, but he said he now supports them.
   And Hatch said Tuesday that he would urge Reagan not to veto the
bill if the notices were limited only to plant closings and
excluded other layoffs. However, a Republican attempt to do that
was defeated Monday.
   ``As long as the layoff provisions are in there, I think he'll
veto it,'' Hatch said of Reagan. ``I've lost on the major issues.''
   Asked if the administration's opposition to the bill was
weakening, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I would
have no way to judge that.''
   The Senate on Tuesday unanimously accepted four minor amendments
by Hatch, including one to exempt replaced strikers from having to
get the 60-day advance layoff notices.
   But it rejected an amendment by Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., that
would exempt companies from having to give the notices to
non-strikers whose jobs might be lost from a plant closing or
layoffs that results from a strike or lockout.
   Also turned down was an amendment by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
that would have limited the notices in layoffs only to workers
losing their jobs as a result of hostile corporate takeovers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&T is not projecting earnings per share to
increase 15 percent this year as its chairman seemed to say two
months ago, the company's chief financial officer said Tuesday.
   Morris Tanenbaum told reporters at a briefing that American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. does not make earnings forecasts. He said
Chairman Robert E. Allen misspoke or was misunderstood when he
seemed to project a 15 percent increase at a news conference in
April.
   Tanenbaum's statement did not shake up AT&T's stock, which rose
25 cents to $26.75 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Lapp Lee, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc., said he had been
slightly skeptical of the statement attributed to Allen anyway
because of the possibility Allen was misquoted or had been speaking
of a goal rather than a forecast.
   At a news conference at AT&T's annual meeting in Denver in
April, Allen was asked whether AT&T would be able to sustain for
all of 1988 the 15 percent increase in earnings per share that it
achieved in the first quarter. Allen answered, ``That's our firm
commitment.''
   Tanenbaum, who did not attend the press conference, said he had
reviewed a transcript of it and said it seemed possible either that
Allen misspoke or that reporters had misunderstood his response.

   Debates on AIDS and the nursing shortage might
grab the most attention, but medical policy-makers meeting this
week are also tackling such issues as the hazards of tanning
parlors and a ban on real-looking toy guns.
   The American Medical Association's law-making body began acting
Tuesday on more than 100 reports and 200 resolutions, ranging from
proposals to require health warnings in alcohol advertising to
cautions about of clove cigarettes.
   The annual meeting of delegates, who represent 295,000 members,
continues throught Thursday.
   The AMA's 420 delegates considered proposals to double the
federal tobacco tax from 16 cents per pack to 32 cents and end
federal price supports to tobacco farmers.
   Delegates were to vote Tuesday on proposals to work for a ban on
the manufacture and sale of realistic-looking toy guns and real
guns made from plastic or other non-metallic materials that are
hard to detect with screening devices.
   The growth of tanning parlors across the country spawned two
proposals aimed at requiring tanning booths to post warning labels
describing the health hazards of exposure to ultraviolet rays.
   Dr. Russell Kridel of Houston, representing the American Academy
of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, said at one hearing
that advertising for tanning parlors mislead many people into
thinking exposure to ultraviolet radiation from tanning booths is
safer than the sun's rays.
   ``There are a number of myths that the tanning parlors are
putting out to the general public and we need to debunk these. We
need to have warning labels on these booths like the warning labels
you have on cigarettes,'' Kridel said.
   The committee agreed and Tuesday urged the delegates to adopt
the policy and work to educate the public about the hazards of
ultraviolet radiation.
   While on the subject of warning labels, Dr. Jack Menendez of
Macon, Ga., called on the AMA to work to force alcoholic beverage
manufacturers to put warnings about the dangers of alcohol abuse in
their advertisements.
   ``I think the idea would be to say something like abuse of
alcohol is bad for your health,'' he said.
   The committee recommended the AMA investigate the need for such
warnings.
   The AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs also issued a report on
the health hazards of smoking clove cigarettes, a mixture of 30
percent to 40 percent clove buds with tobacco.
   A committee recommended that the AMA adopt a policy opposing the
use of Indonesian-imported clove cigarettes, which may be linked to
severe respiratory illnesses.
   The growing use of steroids by athletes to build up their
muscles produced a proposal for AMA action. Improper steroid use
poses such dangers as permanently impairing the one's sexual
functions.
   ``This is not a matter of a few athletes popping some pills,''
said Dr. Dave Richards of Salt Lake City. ``These young athletes
are taking intravenous steroids in doses far larger than are
considered therapeutic. They are spending amounts of money that
approach the amount spent for illicit drugs.''
   The committee urged the AMA delegates to adopt a policy
declaring that using steroids to enhance athletic ability is
``entirely inappropriate'' and calling on state legislatures to
enact laws to control their use and distribution.

   A forecast for rain and possible relief for drought-stricken
crops brought corn and soybean futures prices down their daily
limits Tuesday in a wild turnaround at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A day earlier, prices were limit-up as corn and bean traders
anticipated a continuation of the drought and further crop
deterioration. The new forecast calling for showers to move into
the Midwest later Tuesday and Wednesday made buyers nervous and
sparked a massive selloff, and other markets dipped in sympathy.
   In other markets, cattle and hog futures prices were mixed at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; cotton prices fell at the New York
Cotton Exchange; crude oil and heating oil declined at the New York
Mercantile Exchange; gold and silver prices dipped at the New York
Commodity Exchange and sugar prices rallied at the New York Coffee,
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
   ``That dirty word was being heard on the floor today, r-a-i-n.
Not a lot, just a little bit, but that's all it takes to scare
anybody,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Corn prices closed down the daily limit _ expanded Tuesday to 15
cents a bushel _ in all but two months; while soybeans fell the
expanded 45-cents-a bushel limit in all months except November 1989.
   ``We're at a turning point here,'' Lespinasse said, as nobody
knows the impact rains forecast for the next few days over much of
the Midwest will have on thirsty crops.
   Wheat prices settled 23 cents to 27{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.73\ a bushel; corn settled 2\
cents to 15 cents lower with July at $3.37{ a bushel; oats settled
15 cents lower across the board; and soybeans settled 25} cents
lower to 45 cents lower with July at $10.14{ a bushel.
   The sharp drop in the corn and soybean markets added a negative
tone to trading in cattle and hog futures at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, analysts said.
   ``All of a sudden with the corn and soybeans limit down, that
gave a signal to those people who had been maintaining the
drought-type spread to kind of cash in,'' said Chuck Levitt, an
analyst in Chicago with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   But losses were tempered by a USDA announcement after the close
of trading ``that they intended to expand beef purchases under the
food assistance programs by $50 million,'' Levitt said.
   The result will be ``that ranchers who are liquidating cows on
the market will find a little better price than what they've been
experiencing of late,'' he said.
   Hog prices were pressured by a fresh round of price decreases on
the wholesale pork market ``when a stronger market was
anticipated,'' Levitt said.
   Cattle prices settled .55 cent lower to .55 cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in August at 64.62 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were unchanged to 1.50 cents higher with August at 73.05
cents a pound; live hogs were .85 cent lower to .22 cent higher
with July at 45.57 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.27
cents lower to 1.65 cents higher, with July at 37.85 cents a pound.
   Cotton prices followed the lead of grains and soybeans, falling
down the daily 2-cents-a-pound limit on concerns of crop-enhancing
rains, after surging up the limit on Monday.
   Cotton settled 1.25 cents lower to 2.38 cents lower for the July
contract, which has no limit. The July contract was 66.42 cents a
pound.
   Precious metals also felt pressure from the selling wave in corn
and beans, said Jack Barbanel, an analyst with Gruntal & Co. in New
York.
   ``When the agriculturals could not sustain a rally ... there
were quite substantial selloffs'' in gold and silver, he said.
   Gold prices settled $5.40 to $5.60 lower with the June contract
at $437.50 a troy ounce; silver settled 17.9 cents to 18.7 cents
lower with June at $6.757 a troy ounce.
   Sugar prices rallied on talk of bottleneck in shipments of
imports, as well as expectations that a drought-induced shortfall
in corn production will lead to high corn syrup prices; persuading
manufacturers to use more sugar instead, analysts said.
   Sugar prices settled .50 cent to .66 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in July at 12.62 cents a pound. New York
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange Tuesday:
   Energy futures were lower in lackluster trading pressured by an
oversupply of crude oil, said Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   Crude oil settled 8 cents to 21 cents lower with the August
contract at $15.78 a barrel; heating oil settled .28 cent to .53
cent lower with July at 42.31 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline
was .42 cent lower to .48 cent higher with July at 51.43 cents a
gallon.

   The federal government on Tuesday sued the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters to force reforms on the
nation's largest labor union, calling it ``a major American
scandal'' dominated by the Mafia.
   The civil racketeering lawsuit _ in the works for more than a
year _ was filed in federal court in Manhattan by U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani.
   ``We are not seeking overall control of the Teamsters union,''
Giuliani told a packed news conference. ``This is a use of the
racketeering statute in a surgical way to attempt to take back from
the Mafia the Teamsters union.''
   Weldon Mathis, the secretary-treasurer and acting president of
the 1.6 million-member union, condemned the suit as ``a vicious
anti-labor attack.'' Two U.S. senators and the AFL-CIO, of which
the Teamsters is a member, attacked the lawsuit as overstepping
government authority.
   Giuliani stressed that ``this lawsuit is not in any sense an
attack on trade unionism or on the many, many Teamsters who are
honest, hard working people.''
   Named as defendants were: the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America; the
general executive board of the union, as a group; the executive
board's 18 members and one former member as individuals; 26 alleged
members or associates of the American Mafia, or La Cosa Nostra; and
the mob's ruling ``Commission'' as a group.
   Twenty-five of those 26 defendants already have been convicted
of Teamsters-related crimes such as labor peace extortion,
embezzling union funds or taking labor payoffs. The board consists
of Teamsters President Jackie Presser, Mathis and 16 vice
presidents.
   The government wants a federal judge to remove from office any
Teamsters officers found at trial to have violated federal
racketeering laws.
   U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein granted the government a
temporary restraining order that bars the board from making large
expenditures of union funds or destroying union records. The order
also banned the 25 previously convicted mob defendants from
participating in union affairs.
   The lawsuit also sought appointment of a union trustee to ensure
free and fair union elections.
   Prosecutors planned to ``attack and reverse once and for all, a
major American scandal: organized crime's alliance with the
Teamsters,'' Giuliani said.
   Speaking at a news conference in Montreal, where the union
general executive is holding its quarterly meeting, Mathis said the
suit was ``a shameful attempt to destroy a democratic union. It
will not be tolerated.''
   At the same news conference, Teamsters lawyer John Climaco said:
``It's pure myth that this organization is in any way influenced or
controlled by organized crime.''
   ``I'm shocked and surprised that anyone who had reviewed this
case, not in the Soviet Union, not in Poland, but in the United
States of America, would take such action,'' Climaco said.
   The leaders declined to outline how they will fight the suit.
``We're not going to litigate this in front of the media,'' Climaco
said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, said the suit sets ``a
terrible precedent.''
   ``If there are union officers who are corrupt or are connected
with the Mafia, then the government should come down on them with
dispatch,'' Hatch said on the Senate floor. ``But I have great
difficulty in the trusteeship of an entire international union. I
don't think the government or any court in this nation is capable
of being a trustee over a union.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., echoed Hatch's remarks. ``I think we're
getting on very, very thin ice here,'' he said.
   At the Justice Department, Attorney General Edwin Meese called
the suit ``a very carefully developed, you might call it almost
legally surgical step to remove the corrupt influences from the
Teamsters.''
   ``It is designed to give the members of the Teamsters what they
deserve, that is, a union that represents them rather than
organized crime,'' he said.
   Meese also said he had no apologies for President Reagan's
having accepted Teamsters support in his 1980 campaign for the
White House.
   ``One of the things that was looked at ... was to see whether
there was evidence of organized crime or other information
available,'' he said. ``There was no such evidence available at the
time.''
   The government used a similar suit two years ago under the
Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act to place Teamsters
Local 560 in New Jersey under the control of a government-appointed
trustee. Giuliani said it was the ninth time prosecutors had used
civil provisions of the RICO laws to attack alleged mob control
over unions or businesses.
   ``That control is so pervasive that for decades the IBT's
leadership has permitted La Cosa Nostra figures to dominate and
corrupt important Teamsters locals, joint councils and benefit
funds,'' prosecutors said in court papers.
   Giuliani said organized crime ``has deprived union members of
their rights through a pattern of racketeering that includes 20
murders, a number of shootings, bombings, beatings, a campaign of
fear, extortion and theft and misuses of union funds.''
   The AFL-CIO issued a statement calling the lawsuit ``a clear
abuse of the government's prosecutorial power and ... if sustained,
would undermine a free trade union movement.
   ``If the Justice Department has evidence sufficient to prove
that officers of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters or any
other union have committed federal offenses, the department should
proceed against those individuals directly under laws which forbid
convicted criminals from holding union office,'' the statement said.
   The Teamsters union rejoined the AFL-CIO in October after a
30-year absence from the labor federation.
   Among the 26 alleged Mafia members or associates named in the
civil action were the reputed heads of six mob families.
   They included convicted crime family bosses Anthony ``Fat Tony''
Salerno of the Genovese group; Anthony ``Tony Ducks'' Corallo of
the Luccheses and Carmine ``Junior'' Persico of the Colombo family.
All three were convicted in 1986 of sitting on the ``commission''
that ruled the U.S. Mafia since Prohibition.
   Salerno, 77, serving a 100-year prison term for the commission
conviction, also was convicted last month of bid rigging in New
York's construction industry. But the same jury acquitted him and
two others of rigging the election of Presser and his predecessor,
Roy Williams.
   Williams, serving a 10-year prison term for trying to bribe a
U.S. senator, testified at the Salerno trial that he was controlled
by Kansas City mobsters.
   Presser, under indictment in Cleveland for an alleged ghost
employee scheme, is on leave from the union following surgery last
month for a brain tumor. In his absence, Mathis is acting president.

<HEAD>Entertainment Company to Take $35 Million Charge Against Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc. says it
expects its second-quarter profits to be reduced by about $35
million after taxes because of losses on its Gotcha! toy gun line
and its investment in troubled toymaker Coleco Industries Inc.
   The announcement Tuesday was made after review of MCA's LJN toy
business and its stockholdings in the Hartford, Conn., toy company,
MCA said.
   Harold Haas, MCA's vice president and treasurer, said the
company had not predicted revenue for the quarter.
   The $35 million after-tax charge is due primarily to reductions
in the value of unsold inventory of LJN's discontinued Gotcha!
guns, which shoot colored dye.
   The charge also relects declines in the market value of MCA's
preferred Coleco stock, the company said.
   Coleco, which lost $47.4 million in the first quarter of this
year, has been in default on the interest payments on $335 million
of its debt securities.
   Investors who own $184 million of those bonds have demanded
immediate payment, and Coleco has indicated it may seek federal
bankruptcy protection if it can not restructure its finances.
   LJN's best known products are game cartridges for Nintendo video
games.
   In the first quarter of 1988, MCA earned $26.9 million on
revenues of $611.2 million.
   The company's other operations include production of television
and home video products, motion pictures and book publishing.

   The closing of an old garbage incinerator Tuesday
raised the prospect that up to 200 daily overseas flights into
Toronto's international airport soon may have to fly without food
for passengers.
   Under Canadian government regulations, garbage from incoming
international flights must be incinerated to prevent the
importation of disease.
   But the old Toronto incinerator used for that purpose closed
Tuesday because of fears that it was spewing dioxins and other
pollutants into the air.
   Temporary disposal facilities at the airport may be ready in
about four weeks, but in the interim, the 52 airlines using Toronto
airport have been unable to find a place to burn 25 tons a day of
waste, said Transport Canada spokesman Ian Taylor.
   The executive committee of the Metropolitan Toronto Council
agreed Tuesday night to keep the old incinerator open, at least for
a few days, to avert a crisis on Wednesday.
   Earlier, Taylor had said that without the incinerator,
``...we'll have nowhere to store the garbage and nowhere to
incinerate it,'' he said. ``The airlines have said that as a last
resort, they may have to withdraw food service. It's a major
problem.''
   A spokesman for Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines, whose only
direct flight into Toronto is from Detroit, said his airline will
simply take any garbage from the short flight back to Detroit.
   Airlines making stopovers at other airports can empty their
garbage there.
   But carriers operating longer direct flights, serving two or
three meals, have no such solution.
   ``You can't fly airplanes around full of garbage,'' said
spokesman Barry Corbett of the Canadian airline Wardair, which has
regular service between Toronto and London, Paris and Honolulu.
   ``It would only take a day or so and your plane would be full of
garbage with no room for baggage. We believe this is resolvable
somehow, before that happens,'' Corbett said.
   The airlines had hoped to ship the waste to a new incinerator in
Hamilton, an hour south of Toronto by road. But Hamilton officials
announced June 22 they will not take the garbage unless airlines
schedule more flights to their city _ a sore point in a steel town
jealous of Toronto's economic dominance.
   As a stopgap, Taylor said, the government will allow the
airlines to install compacting and dehydration machines at the
airport to turn the waste into odorless pellets. The pellets can
then be stored in an airport building until a permanent solution is
found, he said.
   ``But that equipment can't be up and running for about four
weeks,'' he added.
   Other Canadian airports have their own incinerators, operated by
the airlines. But Toronto residents objected to a similar proposal
here.
   Taylor said Canada insisted on the incineration of garbage from
overseas flights after a major outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease
in 1952 was blamed on contaminated imported sausage. Waste from
domestic flights is taken to landfills.

<HEAD>NRC Staff Proposal Would Expedite Licensing of Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
unveiled a proposal Monday aimed at making it easier to license new
nuclear plants and warned that no one will ever build one again
unless something like it is adopted.
   Under the proposal, the commission could grant a conditional
operating license at the same time it grants a construction permit,
provided that the plant design conformed with previously tested and
approved models.
   The NRC still would have to decide when construction was
complete if the conditions for operation had been met, but the
procedure would entail far less time and effort than the current
licensing system, in which some plants have remained idle for years
even after construction was complete.
   The draft regulation would sharply restrict the required public
hearings on operating licenses to allegations of ``material and
uncorrected nonconformance'' with the conditional license or
allegations ``that adequate protection is threatened.''
   The commission has long sought congressional authority to grant
the operating license and the construction permit at the same time
for standardized plants. But various bills to encourage
standardization and allow such ``one-stop'' licensing have not
gotten beyond the hearing stage.
   In presenting the regulatory proposal, William C. Parler, the
NRC's general counsel, told the commissioners, ``It is my judgment
that unless the (licensing) process is changed, it is not likely to
be used by people who have to make the decisions about obtaining
bulk power supply in the future.''
   Utility executives have voiced similar sentiments for years.
   Commission Chairman Lando Zech said he hoped to publish the
proposal for public comment soon. He said it was ``perhaps the most
important initiative we are engaged in this year.''
   Loring Mills, vice president for nuclear matters at the Edison
Electric Institute, the nation's principal trade association of
private utilities, said later, ``We are in favor of whatever the
NRC can do administratively to move forward on standardized plant
design and one-stop licensing.''
   Though 107 commercial plants provide more than 18 percent of the
nation's electricity, huge construction costs, delays and
controversy over safety have meant no new plant orders since the
1970s.
   The 107 plants encompass more than 60 reactor designs from five
providers and built by more than a dozen engineering companies. At
Connecticut's Millstone plant, three different builders provided
reactors.
   Standard designs to which modifications are strictly limited are
bound to save costs, make operation easier and facilitate the
transfer of expertise and safety information from one operator to
another, the commission believes.
   The new plan would permit utilities to win approval for a site
in advance of approval of plant design, with such authorization
good for 20 years to permit ``banking'' of sites.
   The commission would also certify standard plant designs as
safe, normally after operation of a demonstration reactor.
   According to the draft regulation, ``the (site) application
shall contain emergency plans which are as fully developed as
circumstances permit and which show that the area surrounding the
site is amenable to emergency planning which would provide
reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures could be
taken in the even of a radiological emergency at the site.''
   The construction application would require a showing that the
utility had made a ``good faith'' effort to win approval of
emergency plans by local and state governments.
   Refusal by the state and local governments to cooperate in an
evacuation plan has kept the Shoreham plant on Long Island from
winning an operating license, and similar objections by
Massachusetts have kept the Seabrook plant just over the border on
New Hampshire's seacoast from operating.
   The commission insists as a general matter that it can license
plants in such circumstances and to require state and local
approval would give those authorities a veto that Congress never
intended.
   Under the proposed plan, a utility failing to get that
cooperation would still have to show that its proposed emergency
plans ``nonetheless provide reasonable assurance that adequate
protective measures can be taken in the event of a radiological
emergency at the site.''

   An overabundance of crude oil on world markets
has depressed most energy futures.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, fell 15 cents to $15.86 per barrel Monday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the July contract
for home heating oil slipped 0.55 cent to 42.59 cents a gallon. The
July contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.14 cent to 51.05 cents a
gallon, but other months declined.
   John Azarow, a trader for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
crude prices fell in response to a report that United Arab Emirates
oil officials want to raise the oil production ceiling allotted to
them by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The UAE's current daily quota is 940,000 barrels of crude, but
the emirates already are producing 1.3 million barrels daily. The
UAE's oil council wants to raise its official ceiling to 1.5
million, Azarow said.
   Gasoline prices, which rose last week as crude prices dropped,
apparently fell victim to profit-taking, Azarow said. The declines
in later-month contracts for gas accelerated the drop in the crude
pit, he said.
   ``It made the crude market even more nervous,'' Azarow said.

   The credit card may have come to symbolize the
American economy in the 1980s, but checks and cash are still the
preferred means of doing business for many consumers.
   ``Remember the great predictions of the 1970s that by the
mid-1980s America would be a `cashless society?''' observed David
Walker, economist at the Bridgeport, Conn.-based People's Bank.
``The experts were wrong _ and probably will continue to be.''
   According to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco, American households use cash to make 36 percent of their
purchases, while credit cards accounts for just 7 percent.
   Checks, which also were once thought likely to be destined for
oblivion, still rank at the top with 57 percent.
   Checks predominate for a couple of important reasons. They are
heavily used for paying bills by mail, since cash in the mail can
get lost, stolen or otherwise go astray without leaving any
evidence of its having been sent.
   In addition, they provide a running record for people on a
budget or simply wishing to keep track of their spending habits.
   Cancelled checks are also useful to have on hand for figuring
and documenting tax deductions, or to settle any dispute that might
come up over whether a given payment has been made.
   As Walker notes, however, cash remains popular as the quickest
and most convenient means of payment for everyday purchases.
   ``Cash transactions also are anonymous, making them attractive
for illegal transactions or tax evasion,'' he adds. ``Indeed,
economists often rely on cash usage patterns to detect the size of
the `underground' economy.''
   Walker argues that the lowering of income tax brackets under tax
reform could stand to reduce the attractiveness of using cash to
avoid taxes. That remains to be seen.
   Ironically, he says, the trend to automation in consumer banking
that was supposed to usher in the cashless society has instead
given cash a fresh boost with the spread of automatic teller
machines, or ATMs.
   In 1977, there were about 10,000 ATMs around the country. Today
the total exceeds 80,000.
   These machines are available to dispense cash to consumers at
any time of day or night, and their proliferation has doubtless
changed the way many people go about spending and managing money.
   Banks have been quick to adopt ATM systems in lieu of employing
more human tellers as a way to lower their operating costs.
   Another incentive for banks to promote their ATMs, Walker says,
lies in their dealings with the Federal Reserve.
   The Fed charges banks a fee for wire transfer of funds and for
processing checks. But it imposes no such fee for its
cash-processing services.
   The credit card has, meanwhile, been dealt a significant setback
under tax reform. The tax deduction for interest paid on consumer
interest is being reduced in stages to zero by 1991.
   Of course, many people pay their monthly credit-card balances in
full, so that they seldom or never incur interest charges. There
are also increasing numbers of debit cards, with which purchases
are processed just as if a check had been written.
   Still, amid all the plastic and paper, coin and currency
continue to hold a prominent position. Concludes Walker, ``Visions
of a cashless society are likely to remain just that. Cold cash
will be with us for some time to come.''

<HEAD>For Fed and Dollar, Suddenly Everything Is Backward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everything is suddenly backward for the nation's
central bank, which ordinarily worries the dollar may fall too
quickly and disrupt the world economy.
   Now the Federal Reserve has to worry that the dollar may rise
too quickly and disrupt the world economy.
   When the dollar is in danger of falling, the Fed is reluctant to
stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates. It fears the lower
rates will drive away foreign investors and sink the currency.
   With the dollar strong, everything is reversed. If the Fed
raises interest rates to keep inflation frm heating, up in the
strong economy, foreign investors may swarm in to take advantage of
the attractive yields.
   The foreign buying would shove the dollar even higher, defeating
the intentions of the Fed and other central banks to keep a lid on
the U.S. currency.
   It may already be happening. World expectations that the Fed
will keep tight reins on money could be one factor pushing the
dollar up, economist Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution said
Monday.
   Litan said he thinks the dollar still is destined to sink under
the weight of the trade deficit, although he said, ``One can easily
concoct a scenario where it stays up for several months, even as
long as until the next election.''
   Whether it's going up or going down, the dollar's movements
illustrate how U.S. policymakers have to keep foreign investors in
mind when they make decisions about the domestic economy.
   If the dollar shoots too high, U.S. companies become
uncompetitive in world markets. Too low, and inflation heats up
because of the increasing cost of imports and the heating up of the
economy's export sector.
   The suddenness of the dollar's rise also illustrates how
unpredictable exchange rates remain, despite efforts by central
banks to smooth out their fluctuations.
   ``You should learn to distrust people who say they know where
the dollar is going to go, because no one has the slightest idea
where exchange rates are going to move from week to week or month
to month,'' said Allan Meltzer, a professor at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.
   Meltzer is fairly bullish on the dollar, despite his reluctance
to forecast exchange rates. That sets him apart from the economists
who believe the dollar will come under pressure from rising
inflation and continued trade troubles.
   David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago, said there is a limit to how much trade can improve as
long as the United States needs to continue importing capital to
cover its shortfall in savings.
   Hale said the savings shortfall can be solved only by cutting
the budget deficit, raising the personal savings rate, or worse,
cutting investment so less capital is needed.
   With no clear signs of any of those happening, Hale said, ``I
think the dollar will go lower again later this year.''
   After months of glassy calm, the dollar burst out of its trading
range with gains of 4 percent against the Japanese yen and West
German mark and 5 percent against the British pound from last
Monday to this Monday.
   The Commerce Department helped trigger the dollar's rally with
its June 14 report that the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to a
seasonally adjusted $9.89 billion in April, its lowest level since
1984.
   But Mieczyslaw Karczmar, a New York-based adviser for Deutsche
Bank, said he believes the biggest factor in the dollar's rise is
the market's perception that the major central banks would stand by
and permit the climb.
   ``The markets are testing this, to see what extent the tolerance
will go,'' Karczmar said.
   At some point the central banks will agree to bash the dollar
back down, and the West Germans may lead the way out of fear that a
weaker mark will add to their inflation rate, Karczmar said.
   ``Historical experience shows that Euroepans are never happy
with the dollar, whether it goes up or it goes down,'' he said.

<HEAD>Securities Analyst, Hong Kong Businessman Tagged in Major Insider
Scam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest insider trading case since the Ivan
Boesky scandal erupted more than two years ago has jolted Wall
Street, this time implicating a trainee at a prestigious brokerage
and a Hong Kong businessman whom the government says reaped $19
million in illicit profits.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint filed
Monday accused Stephen Wang Jr., a junior analyst in a training
program at Morgan Stanley & Co., of giving secrets about impending
corporate takeovers to Fred C. Lee, a Morgan Stanley client with
homes in Hong Kong and McLean, Va., a swank Washington suburb.
   ``From at least July 1987 through at least April 1988, Lee
placed long-distance telephone calls from McLean, Va., Hong Kong
and elsewhere to Wang at his home and office in New York,'' read
the SEC complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. ``During these
telephone calls, Wang improperly disclosed to Lee the material,
non-public information.''
   Lee paid Wang at least $200,000 for the information, according
to the complaint.
   Thomas C. Newkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel, said a
probe into the activities of Wang and Lee was continuing and he did
not rule out the possibility that others may have been involved.
   SEC sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, also
said they expected federal prosecutors to seek criminal indictments
against Wang and Lee, the same pattern that emerged in the Boesky
case.
   The SEC said Lee made $19 million by trading on the tips and
shared at least $200,000 of the money with Wang. It demanded the
pair return the money plus pay triple that amount in penalties, for
a total of $76 million.
   The amount is second only to the record $100 million in profit
and fines paid in November 1986 by Boesky. The former, well-known
speculator was at the center of a massive scandal in which Wall
Streeters illegally used confidential corporate information to
profit in stock transactions.
   Boesky, who implicated a number of other Wall Street
professionals, was banished from the securities business for life
and is serving a three-year federal prison term.
   Morgan Stanley, which was an adviser in the proposed takeovers
listed in the complaint, moved quickly to distance itself from any
suggestion of wrongdoing. The firm said it suspended Wang last
Friday after the SEC subpoeanaed him.
   The firm also said it had been cooperating with the SEC for some
time in its probe and was considering separate but unspecified
legal action against Wang and Lee.
   The New York Times in today's editions quoted unidentified
sources as saying that Morgan Stanley's compliance department had
picked up suspicious trading in Lee's account as early as last year.
   Newkirk said the SEC began investigating the matter in April but
the probe did not break until Friday, when Lee admitted details of
his arrangement with Wang to commission officials interviewing Lee
in Hong Kong.
   Morgan Stanley officials said Wang lived in New York but his
whereabouts were unclear. Wang's lawyer, former SEC regional
commissioner Ira L. Sorkin, declined to comment on the complaint or
his client.
   Wang, 24, was only a few days away from the July 1 expiration of
his two-year training period at Morgan Stanley, which like other
big brokerages utilizes an extensive recruiting system. He had
spent the second year of the program in the firm's mergers and
acquisitions unit.
   Trainees are expected to leave at the end of the program. Most
usually go to graduate business school and some are invited to
return.
   An employee of Wang's rank generally made a salary and bonus
that totaled around $35,000 a year, sources at the firm said.
   Lee, 38, was described by Morgan Stanley and SEC sources as a
wealthy member of a Taiwanese family who had a number of trading
and bank accounts, interests in real estate, import-export
operations and public utilities.
   SEC investigators also asked that Lee's bank accounts be frozen,
alleging in the complaint that Lee had attempted to move money out
of the United States.
   Gary Lynch, the SEC enforcement chief, said investigators allege
the trading on inside information involved stock in about 25
different companies, including E.F. Hutton Group Inc. Stop & Shop
Cos., Utah Power & Light Co. and Impact Systems.
   The complaint said, for example, Lee made $3 million in profit
by trading the stock of Stop & Shop; $1.2 million in profits on the
stock of E.F. Hutton; and $840,000 in profits on Utah Power.

   Stephen Wang Jr. was days from completing a
two-year traineeship at prestigious Morgan Stanley & Co. when the
government implicated him in the second-biggest insider trading
scheme ever to rock Wall Street.
   The 24-year-old junior analyst in the mergers and acquisitions
department was named in a Securities and Exchange Commission
complaint Monday alleging he conspired with a Hong Kong businessman
to profit illegally from takeover stocks using inside information.
   Morgan Stanley said it suspended Wang last Friday when SEC
investigators subpoenaed him following a discreet investigation
that lasted two months. Wang's whereabouts weren't known Monday and
his attorney, former SEC regional commissioner Ira L. Sorkin,
declined to comment on any aspect of the case.
   The complaint asked the federal court in New York to order the
return of $19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple that
amount in damages, for a total of $76 million.
   Wang, who was said to make about $35,000 annually in salary and
bonus, was scheduled to complete his training program this Friday.
   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, said the case is the
second biggest insider trading case ever handled by the SEC,
dwarfed only by the case brought against Ivan Boesky, the former
speculator who paid the enforcement agency a record $100 million in
disgorged profits and penalties in November 1986.
   Wang attended the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana for
four years, beginning in the fall of 1982, first studying political
science, then switching to finance and accounting, officials at the
school said.
   But administrators at the university's main record office and at
the College of Commerce said Wang did not finish his course work.
   Larry Friedman, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said the investment
house was aware Wang was ``about two credits shy of his degree''
when he entered the training program in the summer of 1986.
   Asked whether Wang had access to particularly sensitive material
while working at Morgan, Friedman said: ``It sure looks that way.''
   The investment house considers the analysts ``full employees _
they sit in on meetings, they're put to work, but they should not
break the rules,'' the spokesman said.
   Like all Morgan employees, Wang and his peers were given written
guidelines that address how to deal with sensitive information,
client confidentiality as well as insider information. The Morgan
spokesman said the detailed guidelines ``go beyond a code of
ethics.''

<HEAD>Crash of A320 May Be Damaging to Airbus, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crash of an Airbus A320 jetliner during a
demonstration flight in eastern France could make potential
purchasers of the plane wary and may be damaging for its
manufacturer, according to some airline analysts.
   Although officials do not yet know exactly what caused Sunday's
crash of the ultra-modern Air France jet, a preliminary probe
indicated the plane was flying too low when it made a pass during
an air show, French officials said Monday.
   But the president of Air France's pilots union said the plane's
engines may have failed to restart at the pilot's command.
   As investigators attempt to sort out the cause of the crash, the
destruction of the highly computerized aircraft has raised
questions about the A320's safety and the potential impact on
Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that builds the plane.
   ``It's obviously not good,'' said Anthony Hatch, an airline
analyst for Argus Research Corp.
   The accident could inflict psychological damage against the
highly-touted A320 and prompt cancelled orders and lost sales,
Hatch said. Because only a handful of the narrow-body jets have are
in service yet, he said, the A320's defenders can not point to a
long flight safety record.
   The incident also focuses attention on the trend toward more
technology and fewer pilots _ the newer planes rely on two pilots
in the cockpit instead of the usual three.
   Airbus, which is financed by the governments of France, Britain,
West Germany and Spain, competes intensely with U.S. aircraft
makers Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The crash of the A320 ``does help Boeing somewhat; it's hard to
say how much,'' said Bill Gorman, an aerospace analyst for
Provident National Bank in Philadelphia.
   The A320 competes most closely with newer versions of Boeing's
737 and with McDonnell Douglas' MD-80 _ which also are relatively
small planes ideal for shorter hauls. But the U.S. rival planes are
less technologically advanced than the Airbus jet.
   Air Canada, which is on the verge of buying 33 A320s, said
Monday it will keep close tabs on the French government's inquiry
into the crash. Airbus is believed to be close to winning the Air
Canada contract over Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
   The A320, which carries about 150 passengers, uses 40 percent
less fuel than similar aircraft and is the fastest-selling plane in
aviation history.
   Only four of the new planes are currently in service _ two are
operated by Air France _ in addition to the one destroyed in the
crash _ and two by British Airways PLC. But more than 500 have been
ordered by 21 customers worldwide, including the French and British
carriers.
   Among U.S. carriers, Northwest Airlines has ordered 100 of the
planes, in a deal valued at $3.2 billion.
   ``I doubt (the crash) would have an impact on our decision to
purchase from Airbus,'' Alan Muncaster, a spokesman for Northwest,
said Sunday. ``But obviously we would want to check into the cause
of the crash.''
   Pan Am Corp., another major U.S. airline, has ordered 16 A320s
for $488 million, with an option to buy 34 more. It would be
premature to re-evaluate that decision until the full results of
the crash inquiry are in, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said
Monday.
   Two U.S. leasing companies also have ordered the A320: GATX Air,
a subsidiary of GATX Corp., has ordered 10 while International
Lease Finance Corp. has three on order. Spokesmen for the two lease
companies were unavailable for comment Monday.
   British Airways suspended use of its two A320s after Sunday's
crash, but put them back into service starting Tuesday as the
result of discussions with Airbus and Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority. Air France's two remaining A320s, which also were
grounded, were put back in operation as of Tuesday.
   The plane's highly computerized system replaces the pilot's
control stick with a series of computers and miles of electronic
cables. Instead of the pilot physically moving the stick to adjust
the aircraft's flaps, for example, computers are used to send an
electronic signal to the flaps.
   ``We have full faith in this airplane,'' said David Venz, an
Airbus spokesman in Herndon, Va. ``It will continue to be one of
the most successful in aviation history.''
   If the cause of the crash turned out to be a computer software
problem, it would be a sort of ``black eye'' for Airbus but would
be easily ironed out, suggested Edward Starkman, an airline analyst
for investment firm PaineWebber Inc.

<HEAD>Paper Products Manufacturer Agrees To Go Private In $3.57 Billion
Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fort Howard Corp.'s decision to go
private in a management-led $3.57 billion leveraged buyout could
spark a bidding war led by foreign investors, according to analysts.
   The agreement unveiled Monday calls for a cash offer of $53 per
share, starting July 1, for all 67.4 million outstanding common
shares of the giant 69-year-old manufacturer of disposable paper,
plastic and foam products.
   Fort Howard stock jumped $3.87{ to $53.87{ a share in heavy
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, following a $2.50 a share
rise on Friday when Fort Howard announced it was negotiating for a
leveraged buy-out.
   The company said the merger was recommended unanimously by a
special committee of Fort Howard's outside directors, which now
will make itself available to receive inquiries from any other
parties interested in acquiring the company.
   ``One could certainly interpret that they have left the door
open for other bidders to come through should they see fit to do
so,'' said Hugh F. Denison, director of research at The Milwaukee
Company. ``I wouldn't be surprised if somebody does.''
   But Denison suggested it would take Japanese or other foreign
buyers looking at the long-term worth of the company to offer more
than $53 a share.
   ``My guess would be that if somebody new comes into the picture,
they would apt to be from a foreign land,'' he said.
   ``It's possible that another bidder might come forward,'' said
Rudolph A. Hokanson, of the firm Blunt Ellis & Loewi, in Milwaukee.
``I have no idea who that could be, but it would have to be someone
who is well financed and who will have to act quickly.''
   The board of directors stated it had signed a definitive merger
agreement with three top Fort Howard executives and the Morgan
Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II, an East Coast limited partnership
formed late last year.
   The Fort Howard executives are Paul J. Schierl, the chairman and
chief executive officer, president Donald H. DeMeuse and Kathleen
J. Hempel, first vice president.
   ``This change in ownership from a public to a privately-held
corporation is in the best interests of shareholders, employees,
customers and the company communities in which we have
operations,'' Schierl said.
   ``As a private company, we can continue to provide excellent job
and career opportunities for our 16,000 employees while maintaining
our commitments to the many communities that depend on Fort
Howard.''
   Schierl said Fort Howard had the financial resources necessary
to serviecs the debt it would incur under the buyout. In a
leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds
that are repaid with money raised by asset sales or cash flow.
   The Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II and Morgan Stanley
Group Inc. plan to provide approximately $1.53 billion in temporary
financing for acquisitions and equity. The so-called bridge
financing is expected to be repaid through a public or private
offering of long-term debt.
   The equity fund has received commitments of more than $1.6
billion from investors, including pension funds and financial
institutions.
   Also subject to certain conditions, Bankers Trust is to lead a
syndicate of banks in providing up to $2.55 billion in primary
financing, of which Bankers Trust will provide $500 million.
   ``Fort Howard is a fine company, with a strong record of
performance,'' Tom Saunders, chairman of equity fund, said. ``We
believe Fort Howard has excellent prospects and we are pleased to
be associated with them.''
   Fort Howard's product line includes bath and facial tissues,
napkins and industrial wipers, paper and plastic cupss, lids,
plates, sandwich containers, food packages, straws and ice cream
cones.
   Fort Howard, founded in Green Bay in 1919, reported 1987 sales
of $1.8 billion and net earnings of $157.7 million. It went public
in 1970.
   The company employs nearly 16,000 people in North America,
Europe and the Far East.

   Although European Economic
Community leaders have agreed to study what steps they could take
to establish a European monetary union, they will not necessarily
be seeking to establish a multi-nation central bank.
   Leaders of the 12 European Economic Community nations, meeting
in a two-day summit in Hanover, agreed to create a panel that will
be chaired by EEC Commission President Jaques Delors, aimed at
recommending ``concrete steps'' toward establishment of a European
monetary union.
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers told reporters early today the
panel also would include central bank presidents from the EEC
nations.
   The committee will prepare a report with proposals for leading
to increased European monetary integration, although there probably
would not be any mention of a European central bank in the panel's
mandate, Lubbers said.
   A senior British official said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
who opposes the idea of a European central bank, did not oppose the
initiative. He also said the concept of monetary union would have
to be better-defined in the coming year.
   European finance ministers would review the panel's
recommendations before their proposals are discussed at the EEC
summit slated to be held in Spain a year from now, Lubbers said.
   Establishment of a centralized European bank is one of the main
topics at the EEC gathering.
   A spokesman for the British delegation said Mrs. Thatcher was
still skeptical such a development could ever occur.
   ``You will only have it (a European central bank) when you
dissolve the (British) House of Commons, among other'' political
institutions, said the British official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``We do not think it would be fruitful to set up a European
central bank,'' he said.
   The British official also said Mrs. Thatcher had proposed six
near-term priorities for the EEC to focus on in its drive to create
a barrier-free internal market by 1992.
   According to the official, Thatcher suggested the EEC
concentrate on, among other things: further liberalization of
financial services to include banking, securities and life
insurance markets; streamlining of testing and product standards
throughout the EEC; further opening of markets for public works
projects; and liberalization of the European transportation market.
   Supporters of the creation of a European central bank and a
common EEC currency say those aims are important to the community's
plans for achieving a totally barrier-free market by 1992.
   Britain also has been reluctant to join the European Monetary
System.
   The EMS is a program under which the currency exchange rates of
participating EEC nations are kept within a certain range to
prevent wide fluctuations. Eight of the 12 EEC countries
participate in the system.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been reluctant to connect the pound with the
EMS because that would decrease domestic control over monetary
policy.
