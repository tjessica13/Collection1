<HEAD>Meese's Friend Says He Rejected Leniency Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E. Robert Wallach says he refused to
testify against his longtime friend, Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, in exchange for a government offer of leniency in the Wedtech
Corp. influence peddling case.
   Wallach, 54, made the statement in an interview broadcast
Tuesday night on KRON-TV, an NBC affiliate. KRON said the interview
was recorded earlier and that further portions would be broadcast
on a Wednesday night news program.
   The San Francisco trial lawyer called Meese ``an honorable man''
and said there ``is nothing to talk about'' with prosecutors
investigating allegations that Meese improperly used his influence
on Wallach's behalf in a proposed Iraqi pipeline deal.
   Wallach, who has known Meese since law school, made the
statement about leniency when asked if prosecutors had approached
his lawyers to work out a deal.
   ``Yes, they did,'' Wallach said.
   Wallach told KRON he learned he was about to be indicted on Dec.
22, when Baruch Weiss, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of New York, contacted Wallach's lawyer.
   ``(Weiss) notified my then-counsel that they had to give up the
arrangements they had entered into with him for a series of
meetings to discuss possible allegations against me,'' Wallach said.
   Instead, Wallach added, Weiss presented his lawyer with a draft
of the indictment.
   ``(He) gave me three days in which to plead guilty and cooperate
_ and then said if, in fact, I would give it some thought, perhaps
they wouldn't indict me on a racketeering charge,'' Wallach said.
   The station said Weiss replied, ``I cannot comment on that''
when asked if Wallach had been offered leniency in exchange for
testimony against the attorney general.
   Wallach said he was an unpaid adviser to Wedtech, a Bronx-based,
minority-owned defense contractor. He is under indictment on
federal racketeering charges for allegedly taking payoffs from
Wedtech officials to influence Meese and other public officials.
   Former Wedtech officials have testified they paid $800,000 to
Wallach to influence Meese. They have said Wallach told them he got
the attorney general to intercede on the company's behalf for a
series of contracts worth $143 million. Meese has denied any
wrongdoing.
   Wallach told KRON he expects to be acquitted of the racketeering
charges and said the indictment ``appears to be very contrived and
very contorted and extremely difficult to find a crime within it.''

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that 85 of
the 159 members of the United Nations violate the organization's
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   In a report covering the first four months of 1988, London-based
Amnesty International said it had identified 3,352 individual cases
of people jailed for the non-violent excercise of their rights as
defined by the U.N. document.
   The declaration, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1948,
calls for civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights
for all people.
   Amnesty International reported it had issued 115 appeals since
Jan. 1 to 45 countries involving more than 450 prisoners who the
human rights organization said it considers at risk of violations
of their rights including torture and death.
   The report said Amnesty International sent 18 missions to 15
countries from January-April and issued 98 documents on human
rights violations.
   ``None of these reports or initiatives should have been
necessary,'' it said. ``In the 40th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, such abuses should have become only a
ghost from the past.''

   The ancestral home of millions of people on
Taiwan is here in Fujian province on the Chinese mainland, and
local officials are trying to lure Taiwanese businessmen back.
   They have even enlisted the aid of a Chinese sea goddess.
   Taiwan and Fujian are separated by 100 miles of water in the
Formosa Strait and 40 years of hostility between the Communist
mainland and Nationalist Taiwan.
   Some businessmen have come to Fujian, nevertheless, even at the
risk of prosecution at home.
   Deputy Gov. You Dexin told visiting foreign reporters that 50
Taiwan firms have defied their government's ban on trade contacts
with the mainland to invest about $50 million in the province.
   The actual number may be much higher. Most Taiwanese avoid
trouble at home by contracting under the names of Hong Kong agents
or relatives on the mainland.
   Taiwan-Fujian trade, which totalled $40 million last year,
reached $20 million in the first four months of 1988, You said.
Most goes through middlemen in Hong Kong, although more than 10
percent is done out on the Taiwan Strait. Overall, indirect trade
between Taiwan and the entire Chinese mainland was an estimated
$1.5 billion last year.
   Fujian officials said among the ideas for bringing in more
Taiwan money are plans to turn three offshore islands into economic
zones for Taiwan investors.
   One is Meizhou, home of the 10th century legendary figure Mazu
who is worshipped on both sides of the strait as a protrectress for
seafarers. For businessmen braving the still stormy waters of the
strait, Mazu could provide welcome shelter.
   Taiwan has been estranged from the mainland since the
Nationalists lost a civil war to the Communists in 1949 and fled to
the island.
   China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, encourages
direct trade and communications links as a first step toward
reunification. In the past, Taiwan adamantly refused all contacts
with the mainland, but it began in October to allow people to visit
relatives in China.
   In the first six months after travel restrictions were lifted,
65,000 Taiwanese came to China, many to Fujian, where about 80
percent of Taiwan's 19.6 million people have their roots.
   Fujian officials say it is inevitable that Taiwan, with its
currency appreciating against the U.S. dollar and its wage costs
rising, will move factories to China, where labor is much cheaper
and where language and customs are the same .
   ``They can make money here,'' said Chen He, magistrate of a
township in the provincial capital of Fuzhou, which is building a
$2.4-million sports equipment factory with a Taiwanese businessman.
``This is their homeland and they love it.''
   During a recent press tour of the province, people frequently
talked of contacts with Taiwan enterprises.
   Hong Ziwei, a 29-year-old toy manufacturer in Shishi, said he
would meet a Taiwan businessman in August to discuss a joint
venture to export toys. The Taiwanese man, he said, had written a
letter to a local relative asking for help in finding a mainland
partner.
   In Quanzhou, Mayor Chen Rongchun said sweet potatoes, a favorite
among millions of Taiwanese with roots in Fujian, could be a big
seller on Taiwan.
   ``Taiwan compatriots will cherish an intimate kind of emotion
for goods coming from this place,'' he said.
   Much of the Taiwanese investment goes to Xiamen, a southern
Fujian port that is one of the nation's four designated special
economic zones with greater authority to attract foreign investment.
   Xiamen's authorities said 39 projects with anticipated Taiwanese
investment worth $42 million have been approved in such fields as
jewelry, shoes, bicycle parts and aluminum window frames.
   While emphasizing that Taiwan is part of China, mainland
officials say Taiwanese are given the same preferential treatment
as foreign investors, or better. In Xiamen, for example,
Taiwanese-funded joint ventures receive a four-year tax holiday,
rather than the three years given foreign enterprises.
   Two Taiwanese business executives in May were given five-year
prison terms by a Taipei court for business dealings on the
mainland. Because of that Fujian officials promise to keep secret
the details of all Taiwanese transactions.
   ``The first question we take into consideration is their
personal security,'' Deputy Gov. You said. ``We take measures to
keep their names secret.''

   Four scientists will share three $130,000 prizes
for their work into breast cancer screening, the genetics of cancer
and a substance that helps cells communicate.
   The General Motors Cancer Research Foundation Prizes will be
presented Wednesday at the National Academy of Sciences in
Washington, D.C., the foundation said.
   Each prize includes $100,000 plus $30,000 to cover expenses for
a scientific conference or workshop.
   Sam Shapiro, professor emeritus of health policy and management
at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in
Baltimore, will share one award with Philip Strax, clinical
professor of oncology and radiology at the University of Miami
School of Medicine.
   They will be honored for conducting a massive study
demonstrating that using mammography, or breast X-rays, to detect
breast cancer in its early stages can save lives.
   Alfred Knudson, senior member of the Institute for Cancer
Research at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, will be
honored for proposing a theory of ``anti-cancer'' genes. Damage to
these genes can lead to cancer.
   Evidence for such genes has been found in some rare tumors and
in cancers of the breast, colon, and lung.
   The third prize will go to Yasutomi Nishizuka, professor and
chairman of biochemistry at the Kobe Univerisity School of Medicine
in Japan. He discovered and purified a substance called protein
kinase C, which plays a key role in handling chemical messages that
come to a cell.
   He also showed that environmental chemicals can act directly on
that substance to promote cancer.

<TEXT>
   The telephone company launched a new service for
culture-lovers Monday _ Dial-a-Poem.
   For 70 cents a minute, British Telecom's customers can hear
five-minute recordings of leading poets reciting their verse.
   Callers dialing 0898-222255 could hear John Heath-Stubbs, 70,
saying: ``I'm very happy to be the first poet to be recorded in
this dial-a-poem series,'' before reciting from four of his poems,
ranging in subject matter from Noah's Ark through cats in poetry to
clocks and space.
   Heath-Stubbs is among six contemporary poets chosen for
Dial-a-Poem.
   It's too soon to tell whether the innovation will confound the
19th-century historian Thomas Macaulay's conviction that ``as
civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.'' But
something clearly is astir.
   The London subway has beun displaying verses of Shelley, Burns
and de la Mare on some of its trains, and a year ago the railroad
company organized poetry readings at some of its stations.
   Sarah Chesney of the English Language Society, the literary
group that selected the poets for Dial-a-Poem, explained in a
telephone interview: ``We felt we should make poetry more
accessible.''
   Added Lisa Bourne, a British Telecom spokeswoman: ``Poetry was
slowly fading away, and we thought it would be a great idea to
bring it back.''
   State-owned until it was floated on the stock market in 1984,
British Telecom is ever on the lookout for a profit-making
sideline, and it said that if Dial-a-Poem attracted 1,000 calls a
week, it would make the service permanent.
   Others poets reading their verse for telephone callers during
the six-week trial run are Kathleen McPhilemy, Jeremy Reed, Bernard
Kops, James Berry and Gillian Allnutt.
   ``We wanted something refreshingly adventurous _ poetry that is
not so obscure that it doesn't come across well on the phone, but
that is also not strictly traditional,'' said Ms. Chesney.
   She said each poet would receive 10 percent of the profits from
the service.
   One problem is British Telecom's phone lines, which aren't
famous for their clarity. Heath-Stubbs came through somewhat
faintly and would only be comprehensible in a quiet room.
   ``I don't think the telephone does the poets justice in a way
that hearing them firsthand would,'' Ms. Chesney said. ``But many
people won't have the chance to hear them firsthand, and for them
it's refreshing to hear them (the poets) in their own voices.''
   To listen to Heath-Stubbs' entire five minutes costs $3.45
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. But a cheaper rate during slack hours
brings the cost down to $2.25. A sampling from Heath-Stubbs's ``The
Cosmic Clock'':
   Planets, stars, galaxies _ the whole
   Winking and blinking caboodle _
   This, it seems, is the only reliable clock:
   A beam from a star crossed a sensitive plate _
   Then came the pips: the British nation
   Turned on the 10 o'clock news.
   
   This is the moving image of eternity _
   I don't mean Paley's watch discarded
   By the absconding Watchmaker
   Upon a bank of Wordsworthian daffodils,
   But pulsars, quasars, decaying elements, black holes;
   Yet this, they say, is likewise winding down _
   And hickory _ dickory, men and mice we run in it!

   The nation's largest Presbyterian body Monday
called on Israel to end its 20-year occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, where the church said Israel had used ``repressive''
measures to quell Palestinian violence.
   The 200th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church declined
to include in its resolution language calling on Palestinians to
recognize Israel's right to exist as a nation.
   The Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian leader and former hostage
in Lebanon, told the 630 commissioners the Palestine Liberation
Organization has made such statements several times. Israel
maintains that such PLO statements have been ambiguous or
unauthoritative.
   The statement adopted Monday on a 494-67 vote said Israel had
responded to uprisings in the occupied territories with ``rigid
censorship, mass arrests, torture of prisoners, administrative
detention and deportation.''
   The resolutions adopted also call upon the ``Palestinian people
and leadership to exert sustained efforts to control acts of
violence in order to facilitate the peace process.''
   Earlier Monday, a major Presbyterian statement on nuclear war
was revised to make the document more closely follow the original
intention, according to the two former seminary professors who led
the writing effort.
   The Committee on Peacemaking and International Relations of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) continued review Monday evening of
``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' making minor changes in
the recommendations of a subcommittee that extensively reviewed the
paper.
   The major change by the Peacemaking committee was made at the
suggestion of the Rev. Arnold Come, former president of the San
Francisco Theological Seminary and a co-chairman of the task force
that wrote the paper last year.
   Originally, the paper said nuclear war and the theory of nuclear
deterrence were both immoral, but the subcommittee revised that to
say ``nuclear deterrence has been in danger of becoming an end in
itself rather than an interim measure of self-defense. Such a
policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible.''
   Come and the Rev. Albert C. Winn, the task force's co-chairman
and former president of the Louisville, Ky., Theological Seminary,
complained the phrase ``as an end in itself'' was ambiguous.
   At Come's suggestion, the language was clarified to say nuclear
deterrence ``is being regarded as an adequate and permanent means
to national security,'' and that is ``not morally defensible.''
   The committee has yet to deal with the major question of the
subcommittee's recommendation that the Christian obedience paper be
adopted as church policy.
   The subcommittee, which met for parts of four days, amended the
paper to make it clear Presbyterians considered obedience to
government the normal course.
   Winn said he disliked many changes, but added, ``in many
respects, they clarified the paper and deleted some statements that
were not carefully worded.''
   Supporters of the original paper expect many of the revisions _
including elimination of a recommendation that the church aid tax
resisters _ would be restored in some form in the full committee.
   Opponents of the paper want it to be sent back to the churches
for further study. An effort to get the subcommittee to recommend
that delay was defeated 9-5 and the subcommittee eventually agreed
to recommend the revised report as a church policy by a 15-1 vote.
   The report is not expected to come before the 630 delegates
until Tuesday. The nine-day meeting adjourns at noon Wednesday.
   The resolution on the Middle East also:
   _Asks Israel to ``cease the systematic violation of human rights
of Palestinians. ... end the policies and-or practices of beatings
and of food and fuel embargoes in the attempt to subjugate and
break the will of the Palestinian population. ... end the
settlements policy and the acquisition of land within the occupied
territories, since (they) provoke the Arab peoples and reduce the
opportunity for a peaceful resolution.''
   _Asks the United States to ``discourage retaliation as a
counter-terror strategy in the Middle East and to address the
injustices which are among the root causes of terrorism. ... insist
that weapons supplied by the U.S. for Israel's defense not be used
against civilian populations in the occupied territories or in
aggressive attacks or disproportionate retaliation upon other
countries, and that further military and security assistance to
Israel be contingent upon the honoring of these principles.
   _Ask all parties to participate in a United Nations-sponsored
international peace conference.
   The agenda included discussion of several decisions, including
the recommendation that the pension board headquarters remain in
Philadelphia. A minority report suggests the board be moved to
Atlanta.
   The headquarters of the 3 million-member denomination was moved
to Louisville, Ky., last year.
   Anti-abortion groups also have objected to the pension board's
paying for abortions. The denomination has adopted a generally
pro-choice position, condemning abortion as a method of birth
control, but saying it remains a decision by a woman, her physician
and her conscience. Anti-abortionists say the pension board should
not pay for abortions.
   Another committee has recommended the denomination undertake a
new study on the issue of abortion.

   Big-city school districts and Southern states
are requiring students to take an ever-mounting number of
standardized tests in the name of reform, according to a nationwide
survey.
   U.S. students are now taking at least 100 million standardized
tests a year, says a report published Monday by FairTest, a
non-profit Cambridge, Mass.-based advocacy group that has attacked
standardized tests as biased against women and minorities.
   The first-of-its-kind survey found:
   _ Elementary and secondary school students took 17.5 million
standardized achievement, competency and basic skills tests to
fulfill state mandates in the 42 states requiring them, and in the
District of Columbia in 1986-87.
   _ Students took 38.9 million additional standardized tests to
fulfill local school district testing mandates, according to the
group.
   _ Between 30 million and 40 million standardized tests,
including I.Q. tests, were administered to compensatory and special
education students, and schools administered between 1.5 million
and 1.75 million screening tests for kindergarten and
prekindergarten students.
   _ College and secondary school admissions tests including the
Scholastic Aptitude Test, ACT, high school achievement tests, and
the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests, accounted
for 6 million to 7 million more.
   ``In this country now, pupils are being tested far too often
with far too simplistic a measure. School reform has led many
schools to become too test happy. The fallout hits those least able
to defend themselves,'' said D. Monty Neill, managing director of
FairTest and co-author of the survey.
   The report, ``Fallout from the Testing Explosion: How 100
Million Standardized Exams Undermine Equity and Excellence in
America's Public Schools,'' included statistics compiled n a
telephone survey last spring of education departments in all 50
states. It also surveyed 56 school districts, including those with
enrollments of at least 100,000 pupils.
   It found that in the 1986-87 school year, the number of states
using tests as part of statewide assessment programs rose from 37
to 42. Twenty-four states required students to pass a standardized
test to graduate from high school rose in 1987, compared with 15 in
1985.
   Large school districts required the most standardized testing by
far. Students in Newark, N.J., averaged nine district-mandated
standardized exams in 1986-87, according to FairTest. Cleveland
students took an average of 2.92, Broward County, Fla., 2.60, St.
Louis 2.45, Cincinnati 2.34, Baltimore 2.30, and Philadelphia 2.0.
   New York City, the nation's largest school district, required
its students to take an average 1.23 standardized tests. The
District of Columbia mandated an average 1.39 per pupil.
   Southern states had the most state-mandated tests. The nation's
39.8 million public school students took 17,545,159 such
state-mandated tests in 1986-87, an average 0.44 per student. But
Southern states often had testing rates more than double that
national average.
   Virginia required its 975,135 public school students to take
1,069,000 tests during the 1986-87 school year, meaning 1.10 such
state-mandated tests per pupil. Kentucky students took an average
of 1.01 state-mandated exams, North Carolina 1.0, Alabama 0.98,
Georgia 0.93, Arizona 0.90, and Missouri 0.83.
   ``Historically the South has been viewed as having weak school
systems. There is a belief that you can test your way to better
schools, and the South jumped on it,'' said Neill in a telephone
interview.
   Tom Ewing, a spokesman for the Educational Testing Service,
which administers the SAT and a variety of other standardized
exams, said he hadn't seen the report and could not comment on it.

   Members of a House Judiciary subcommittee,
examining alleged abuses in the FBI's investigation of a group
opposed to the Reagan administration's Central America policy, said
Monday they intend to draft more restrictive standards for probes
of terrorists in this country.
   ``What we've tried to do in the past is rely on the Constitution
for protecting individual rights,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., chairman of the civil and constitutional rights
subcommittee. ``I am thinking seriously of sometime early next year
taking another quick look at this issue and writing the beginnings
of an FBI charter.''
   Edwards and other members of the panel appeared to agree with
recommendations from four witnesses that there should be one
standard, instead of the current two sets of guidelines, for FBI
probes of domestic terrorism and that this standard should be
written into law instead of left to the attorney general to
determine.
   One witness, Morton Halperin, director of the Washington office
of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he believes that ``all
investigations of political organizations should be based on
public, codified guidelines and should include frequent review to
ensure that they stay within the prescribed bounds.''
   Halperin added, ``The ACLU believes that one publicly enunciated
standard should apply for all criminal intelligence
investigations.''
   Spurring Monday's hearings was the FBI's handling of an
investigation into the Committee in Solidarity with the People of
El Salvador, or CISPES.
   The New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions that
government officials said an internal FBI report has recommended
disciplinary action against some bureau personnel, possibly
including field agents, involved in the CISPES investigation.
   The officials said the report is the most critical to date from
senior bureau officials and was sent last month to FBI director
William Sessions from the bureau's Inspection Division. But the
officials told the newspaper Sessions has not made a decision on
whether to punish anyone for action in the CISPES operation.
   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich would not comment on the contents of
the division's report but said ``This agency has no hesitancy in
disciplining its own people...''
   According to FBI documents released in January and comments by
FBI officials since then, that investigation began in September
1981 as a probe into alleged criminal violations of domestic
security laws. Specifically, the FBI was looking into whether
CISPES was supplying money and material to leftist rebels in El
Salvador.
   That investigation was closed the following February. But in
March 1983, the FBI began a new investigation of CISPES under a
different set of guidelines, those governing international
terrorism. Although much of those guidelines are classified, it is
known that they give the FBI far more sweeping authority to
investigate U.S. citizens.
   Eric Richard, a former Justice Department aide, told the
subcommittee that ``it may not have been fully realized how
frequently the groups that would be the targets of such
(international terrorism) investigations would be composed
primarily of American citizens.''
   Richard and other witnesses agreed that although the FBI said it
was looking into whether CISPES was a front group for a core of
people who were aiding international terrorists, the bureau's
investigation ended up focusing on public CISPES meetings and
statements.
   ``Widescale monitoring of public events served on apparent
purpose toward achieving the FBI's stated objective,'' Halperin
testified. ``A front organization ... is not going to reveal its
hidden agenda in its public activities.''
   Halperin argued and John E. Finn, an assistant professor of
government at Wesleyan University, disagreed that the FBI violated
the First Amendment rights of CISPES members by using that tactic.
   However, all four witnesses agreed that the FBI never would have
been able to conduct its investigation that way had it been
required by law to look for criminal violations.
   ``The domestic security guidelines require a criminal link,''
Richard said, adding that that is not so with the international
terrorism guidelines.
   ``The domestic security ... guidelines have worked so well in
balancing civil liberties, intelligence and law enforcement
concerns that it may be time to spread the benefits of these
guidelines more widely,'' he said.
   The witnesses also said that an FBI statute should require that
investigations of suspected terrorists in the United States be
reviewed frequently by top FBI and Justice Department officials.
   Kenneth C. Bass III, also a former Justice Department official,
told the panel that he thought there was a need for frequent
reviews because ``it it my experience these investigations often
continue a year or more after they should have ended.''

<HEAD>`Spycatcher' Author Says HE Has Plenty More To Tell, But Plans No
Sequel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Author Peter Wright says he has much
more to tell about Britain's MI5 intelligence service but plans no
sequel to ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs the British government failed
to suppress here.
   ``There are 10 major stories which I have not put in and
probably others if I thought hard enough,'' Wright told the
Australian Broadcasting Corp. Monday.
   It was the first time Wright had spoken publicly since the High
Court ruled against the British government on June 2, ending a
three-year court battle to block Australian publication of his
story.
   Wright said it was the stories he had not told that led the
government to fight so hard to suppress the book.
   ``They have always been frightened of what I know and what I
might say publicly and they still are,'' he said.
   ``Spycatcher'' describes Wright's 20-year career in the MI5
counterespionage service.
   It alleges that the security service eavesdropped on foreign
embassies, burgled offices, stole documents, plotted assassination
attempts and discussed how to bring down Harold Wilson's Labor
Party government in the 1970s.
   Wright said he had not decided what to do with the unpublished
material but doubted he would write a sequel.
   ``I'm too tired at the moment, we'll have to recover from all
this and I think that perhaps I have done my bit,'' he said.
   Wright's wife, Lois, commented, ``There will be a sequel to
Spycatcher over my dead body.''
   Wright, who retired to Tasmania in 1976, said the court battles
in Australia helped make ``Spycatcher'' a bestseller.
   ``I thought initially we might get a print run of about 50,000
at most. Now we are looking at more than 1 million copies sold in
the U.S.A. alone,'' he said.
   So far, more than 1.4 million copies have been sold in 40
countries, including the United States, despite the government's
continued ban in Britain and Hong Kong.
   The book is frequently smuggled into Britain and excerpts have
been published in British newspapers. The British government has
sought to clamp down on these as well, prompting outcries over
freedom of the press.
   The government maintains it has pursued the case to uphold the
principle that former security officers are bound by a lifetime
oath of silence about their work.
   The Australian High Court said Australian courts had no
jurisdiction to enforce a British security regulation.

   A fired computer company employee
returned to his offices Monday and fatally shot himself after
earlier holding two hostages at gunpoint for much of the day,
authorities said.
   Police spokesman Jim Wheatley said Mervin D. Gilliam, 28,
entered Zeus Components in this Dallas suburb with a 12-gauge
shotgun shortly after 8 a.m. looking for his former boss and
attempted to take four hostages, but two escaped.
   One man and one woman were held for much of the day. Donna
Dippel, a company secretary in her 20s, was released early
afternoon and Roman Gonzales, a Dallas resident in his early 30s,
was released at about 4 p.m., Wheatley said.
   Associates said they were shocked by the incident.
   ``He was a very nice guy,'' said Greg Foster, pastor of Hamilton
Park First Baptist Church, which Gilliam attended.
   ``Sometimes something in a person's life comes up that you can't
explain. Mervin wasn't capable of this.''
   ``I'm surprised to see him do something like this,'' said
co-worker Brad Davis, 36.
   The gunman's brother, Charles Gilliam, and his mother arrived at
the offices late Monday morning to help police negotiate, Wheatley
said.
   Dwain Thompson, who described Gilliam as a friend and ``a very
talented young man,'' said Gilliam had recently been through a
period of depression after losing his girlfriend and his job.
   The company did not make public the reason for the firing.
   Police were on a direct telephone line with the man when they
heard a muffled gunshot and the phone went dead about 5:20 p.m.,
said Capt. Joe Hanna. Police entered the building immediately after
hearing the shot and found Gilliam dead, Hanna said.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's foremost theater is gripped
by a real-life drama that rivals the classics presented on its
historic stage.
   The star is West German Claus Peymann, imported to direct the
Burgtheater and embroiled in battles with his actors and the Vienna
cultural establishment.
   A premier of ``Oedipus'' Sunday night turned into a
demonstration for and against Peymann, with banners unfurled on
stage and the divided audience booing and cheering.
   A city that relishes scandal and prizes its theaters and opera,
got the first whiffs of sensation on May 26, when the West German
weekly Die Zeit published an interview with Peymann.
   The director said ``this country is a madhouse'' and that he was
often involved in ``dreadful things of the most banal kind.'' He
even suggested that the famed Burgtheater be torn down.
   Reaction was swift.
   The Socialist politicians who appointed Peymann in 1986
predictably defended their choice, arguing that the director had
brought life and exciting art to the marble halls of the Burg.
   Conservatives offended by Peymann's stark productions of beloved
German classics seized the chance to call for the director's
resignation.
   The Burgtheater actors were quick to criticize Peymann for
cutting salaries and for changing the way tickets, rehearsals and
roles are allocated.
   Nearly everybody attacked Peymann for bringing in 15 actors from
West Germany. Most of them are friends from Peymann's days as
director of the West German theater in Bochem before he was lured
to Vienna.
   The newcomers have gotten almost all the leading roles in
Peymann's new productions. But locals ridiculed the new actors for
their northern German vernacular, which offends the ear of an
audience used to the distinctive delivery long considered among the
Burgtheater's greatest merits.
   The issue became the chief topic of conversation in Viennese
coffeehouses and the media entered the fray with debates on Peymann.
   Many commentators saw an attempt by Germans to subvert Austria's
distinctive German language and culture. Franz Morak, anti-Peymann
spokesman for the Burgtheater ensemble, spoke of a
``de-Austrianization'' of the Burg.
   Peymann countered Monday with accusations of ``nationalism and
hatred for strangers'' in Vienna.
   That charge has often been made in a city that prizes the
imperial past that gave it the Burgtheater and many other artistic
institutions.
   When Lorin Maazel stepped down as director of the city's famous
opera in 1984, two years before his contract expired, he bitterly
charged that critics and officials had united to get him out.
   Criticism of the directors of the Vienna Opera and the
Burgtheater has a long tradition in Vienna, where the posts are
often described as Austria's most impossible jobs.
   But the drama over Peymann has reached an unusual pitch.
   With discussion in full swing, prominent commentator Hans
Rauscher in the tabloid Kurier was one of the few to chide his
compatriots for their absorption in the Peymann affair. In a
column, Rauscher described the effect of picking up Austrian
newspapers on the plane while on his way home.
   ``One can only shake one's head in amusement and despair,''
wrote Rauscher. ``Are these really our worries? This orgy of
small-mindedness? These childish quarrels? Is the plane landing in
a republic of dwarfs? Or in a kindergarten?''

   As part of the campaign against the
spread of AIDS, travelers are being given the opportunity to learn
how to suggest the use of a condom in seven languages.
   ``Sex has become more dangerous. ... This does not mean that one
should be afraid of sex, but observant and careful of oneself and
others,'' says a pamphlet included in a package for sale at travel
agencies and train stations around Sweden.
   The package includes a packet of condoms and a dictionary of
sex-related phrases, according to the Social Affairs ministry.
Among the phrases are, ``I want us to use a condom,'' and ``I think
I might have a venereal disease.''
   ``Only the condom can provide any good protection against
sexually transmitted diseases,'' the pamphlet says.
   Health authorities this year sent 4 million pamphlets to homes
to explain in graphic detail how AIDS is transmitted and
distributed camouflage condoms to military conscripts.

   A House Judiciary panel is considering writing
tougher standards for FBI terrorism investigations in the United
States to prevent the bureau from violating the rights of
legitimate domestic political groups.
   Lawmakers concede that election-year politics probably will
delay action until 1989. But during a hearing on Monday into
alleged FBI abuses in an investigation of anti-Reagan
administration activists, members of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights agreed with
witnesses who recommended new controls on such investigations.
   FBI officials have said an internal investigation of the
operation found several problems with it, and The New York Times
reported today that an internal FBI report recommends disciplinary
action against some of those involved.
   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich would not comment on the contents of
the report and said that FBI Director William Sessions had made no
decision on its recommendations.
   The FBI conducted much of its probe of the Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, a U.S. group opposed to
Reagan administration policies in Central America, under guidelines
that are supposed to cover investigations of international
terrorism.
   Using those guidelines allowed the bureau to conduct widespread
surveillance of political rallies and individuals including nuns,
union officials and college professors opposed to administration
policy.
   Witnesses and lawmakers at Monday's hearing said there should be
just one set of guidelines instead of the current two _ domestic
and international _ governing such investigations.
   The standard, witnesses agreed, should specify that the FBI look
for criminal actions and steer clear of a group's political
activity.
   Lawmakers and witnesses also agreed that the standard should be
written into law instead of left to the attorney general to
determine.
   ``What we've tried to do in the past is rely on the Constitution
for protecting individual rights,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., chairman of the House panel. ``I am thinking seriously of
sometime early next year taking another quick look at this issue
and writing the beginnings of an FBI charter.''
   The FBI justified its use of the international terrorism probe
guidelines in the CISPES investigation by citing an informant's
claim that some of the group's members were giving money and
supplies to a leftist group in El Salvador.
   But no criminal charges were ever filed against CISPES or any of
its members, and the investigation was closed in June 1985.
   One witness at Monday's hearing, Morton Halperin, director of
the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said
the current guidelines ``accommodate the demands of law enforcement
without fully protecting the lawful exercise of our constitutional
rights.''
   Halperin said the FBI's investigation of CISPES ``demonstrates
that the current FBI guidelines have failed to protect Americans
from improper government surveillance.''
   According to FBI documents released in January and comments by
FBI officials since then, the bureau's initial probe of CISPES
began in September 1981 as an investigation into alleged criminal
violations of domestic security laws.
   That investigation was closed the following February. But in
March 1983, the FBI began a new investigation of CISPES under the
broader guidelines governing international terrorism. Although much
of those guidelines are classified, it is known that they give the
FBI far more sweeping authority to investigate U.S. citizens than
the domestic guidelines do.
   Eric Richard, a former Justice Department aide, told the panel
that when the international terrorism guidelines were written, ``it
may not have been fully realized how frequently the groups that
would be the targets of such investigations would be composed
primarily of American citizens.''
   John E. Finn, an assistant professor of government at Wesleyan
University, disagreed with Halperin's contention that the FBI
violated the First Amendment rights of CISPES members by attending
CISPES meetings, obtaining the group's literature and recording the
license plate numbers of cars parked outside CISPES meetings.
   But all of the witnesses, including Finn, agreed that the FBI
would not have been able to mount such an extensive domestic
surveillance campaign had it been limited to looking for actual
criminal violations.
   ``Widescale monitoring of public events served no apparent
purpose toward achieving the FBI's stated objective. A front
organization ... is not going to reveal its hidden agenda in its
public activities,'' Halperin said.
   ``The domestic security guidelines require a criminal link,''
Richard said, adding that those rules have worked well ``in
balancing civil liberties, intelligence and law enforcement
concerns.''
   The witnesses also said that an FBI statute should require that
investigations of suspected terrorists in the United States be
reviewed frequently by top FBI and Justice Department officials to
ensure that there is sufficient evidence to continue.

<HEAD>Impact of Supreme Court's Vaccine Ruling Debated</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Kevan, graf 2, cq</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has reduced the government's
protection against lawsuits by victims of defective federally
licensed vaccines, but some authorities say the ruling's impact may
be limited.
   The justices ruled unanimously Monday that the parents of Kevan
Berkovitz, a Pennsylvania boy crippled by polio, may sue the
government.
   But Ronald J. Greene, a lawyer for Lederle Laboratories which
manufactures polio vaccine, said the impact is unclear.
   The decision appears to cover all government-licensed vaccines
and possibly other drugs as well, he said. But he added that the
standards enunciated by the court may affect few cases.
   ``The facts alleged here are unusual and I don't know whether
they (the Berkovitz family) can prove them,'' he said. ``These are
circumstances that are unlikely to arise'' very often.
   Health experts, meanwhile, said the nation's common vaccines
pose little risk.
   ``In terms of serious side effects, it's far better to be
vaccinated than to get the disease,'' said G. Scott Giebink,
professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical
School.
   Polio paralysis results only from about one out of every 3.2
million doses of oral polio vaccine, he said.
   In another example, about one in 110,000 children who get the
Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP) vaccine develop a brain
dysfunction that can include seizures. It is usually temporary.
Only about one in 310,000 vaccinated children suffer permanent
damage that includes mental retardation or movement difficulties,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   Reagan administration lawyers had warned that exposing the
government to financial liability for faulty vaccines could have
serious consequences.
   The Justice Department said the threat of big-money damages
against the government could threaten availability of lifesaving
vaccines by prompting federal officials to reconsider the approval
of polio vaccine, and delay or withhold approval for new vaccines.
   The Food and Drug Administration, which licenses more than 40
vaccines, declined to comment on the ruling.
   A financial analyst said the decision may be good news for drug
manufacturers.
   ``This is very good for the vaccine companies, but there are not
that many of them,'' said Richard Vieter, a drug industry analyst
with Merrill Lynch Co. ``One might look ahead to vaccines such as
AIDS vaccines and other bio-tech applications, though.
   ``It seems the government will have to exert quite a bit more
care in the approval process to prevent placing the government in a
liability situation,'' Vieter said.
   Kevan Berkovitz was two months old in May 1979 when his
pediatrician in Charleroi, Pa., gave him a dose of Orimune, a polio
vaccine made by Lederle.
   Orimune, a form of Sabin oral vaccine, was licensed by the
government in 1963.
   Kevan was stricken with polio within a month after taking the
vaccine and the U.S. Communicable Disease Center determined he
contracted the disease from the vaccine.
   The boy, now 9, is paralyzed from the neck down and uses a
respirator to help him breathe. Monday's ruling provides an
opportunity in court to seek compensation for him from the
government.
   His lawyer, Ellen Viakely of Pittsburgh, said of the ruling,
``It's a case where the government knew that this particular polio
vaccine violated its own regulatory safety standards. By the
government's own regulatory standards, this vaccine was unsafe. But
it licensed it anyway.''
   Ms. Viakely said the ruling will not affect cases in which those
who received a vaccine had an allergic reaction.
   The polio vaccine is the only common vaccine clearly shown to
cause the disease it was supposed to prevent, said Samuel Katz,
chairman of the pediatrics department at the Duke University
Medical Center.
   Sabin vaccine is now administered routinely to nearly every
child in the United States and has all but eliminated polio. But
each year a small number of people suffer adverse reactions to the
vaccine, federal officials say.
   In other actions, the court:
   _Agreed to judge the constitutionality of a new sentencing
system for people convicted of federal crimes. By the time the
justices announce their decision sometime in 1989, more than 10,000
federal court defendants will have been subjected to the new
sentencing system.
   _Armed police with new authority as it ruled unanimously in a
Detroit case that officers sometimes may pursue someone who starts
running at the sight of them, even though they have no reason to
suspect criminal conduct.
   _Barred states from banning all direct-mail advertisements sent
by lawyers to potential clients. Voting 6-3, the justices struck
down Kentucky's policy of prohibiting lawyers from sending letters
to people they know face legal problems.

   New findings showing that AIDS can be
transmitted through breast milk should not deter Third World
mothers from breast-feeding their babies, experts say.
   Six cases of the lethal AIDS virus, called HIV, being spread
through breast milk were reported Monday at the Fourth
International Conference on AIDS. But the hazards of bottle-feeding
in poor countries are probably higher, some of the scientists said.
   ``The benefits of being breast-fed by an HIV-infected mother
clearly outweigh the risks in developing countries,'' said Kathy I.
Kennedy of Family Health International in Research Triangle Park,
N.C.
   She and her colleagues conducted a statistical analysis showing
that babies in poor countries are far more likely to die from
diseases resulting from bottle-feeding than from the possible risk
of catching the AIDS virus.
   In poor parts of the world, bottle-feeding is often risky, in
large part because infant formula can be mixed with contaminated
water.
   Researchers from Cornell University Medical College in New York
studied 45 AIDS-infected children in Haiti, where AIDS infections
are relatively common. They said they found no evidence that any of
them caught the virus from breast milk.
   ``We feel that transmission from breast milk is quite low,''
said Dr. John Ho, one of the Cornell researchers. ``On a broad
basis, it is probably not an important factor.''
   Experts believe that most babies with AIDS got the infection
from their mothers before birth. There is a 25 percent to 50
percent risk that an infected mother will pass the virus to her
developing child.
   The risk of contracting the disease through breast-feeding is
probably substantially greater from mothers infected after birth as
opposed to those carrying the virus before conception, said Dr.
John Ziegler of Prince of Wales Children's Hospital in Westmead,
Australia.
   ``Breast-feeding women should be aware that if they become
infected, their baby is likely to be infected as well,'' he said.
   Ziegler has reviewed nine cases in which breast-feeding women
became infected with the AIDS virus after giving birth and found
that three of their babies caught the virus.
   He described two of the cases, while a third in Australia was
reported by Dr. Marion Bucens of Princess Margaret Hospital in
Perth.
   ``We don't know how often this happens,'' Bucens said. ``In the
Third World countries, this is of great importance because of the
enormity of heterosexual transmission'' of the AIDS virus. ``There
are so many women who are infected.''
   Ziegler said that for uninfected babies whose mothers had the
virus before they were born, the risk of breast-feeding is probably
relatively small.
   But it appears to be substantially higher if the woman catches
the virus while she is breast-feeding. This is because she is
likely to produce high levels of virus in her breast milk early in
the infection.
   One typical case was presented by Dr. Pierre Weinbreck and
colleagues from the Hospital and Medical University of Limoges in
France.
   A 28-year-old woman received a transfusion of AIDS-tainted blood
after giving birth. She then breast-fed her baby for a month.
   Two years later, she developed AIDS, and her child was also
found to be infected.
   Two other cases were reported by Dr. Robert L. Colebunders from
Mama Yemo Hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. In one of them, a baby
caught the virus from an AIDS-infected wet nurse.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers. It is is most often transmitted through sexual contact.
   Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted
blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic
needles or syringes by drug abusers.

   Actor Robert De Niro is preparing for
his role as an illiterate mill worker by having a researcher
interview men who can't read or write.
   Cynthia Ryan was here last week videotaping current and former
illiterate adult men from western Massachusetts, where part of the
film tentatively named ``Union Street'' will be shot.
   Ryan said some of the men she is videotaping agreed to the
interviews only after she promised to conceal their identities.
   The researcher is making 10 hours of videotapes for De Niro to
study for his role as a man who is taught how to read. He is now on
a movie set in California making a film about a Vietnam veteran.
   De Niro's co-star in ``Union Street,'' Jane Fonda, has raised
the ire of some veterans in a few New England towns for her
anti-war work during the Vietnam War.
   Holyoke aldermen voted in January to approve a symbolic
resolution protesting Fonda's plans to film in the city because of
her visit to Hanoi during the war. Beverly aldermen narrowly
defeated a similar resolution.

   Entertainer Marie Osmond says she admires her
mother, Olive, and still finds it hard to believe that her mom
raised nine children.
   ``I have to applaud people like my mother,'' Osmond, 28, said in
an interview in July's McCall's magazine.
   ``I don't know how she raised nine children. And she's a
brillant woman. People send her computer problems to find bugs. ...
She is the most incredible human being.''
   ``Contrary to what you may have read _ how my brothers led me
with an iron fist and how my mother was domineering _ that's really
not true. Even as a teenager, I was very much in control of the
things I was doing.''
   ``I think its important to say, too, that my beliefs don't come
from my parents,'' Osmond said. ``I am a member of my Mormon faith
because I want to be.''
   About her career plans, Osmond said: ``I would love to go into
films. ... I would not get into nudity or anything like that ...
and maybe that will be the thing that will keep me from doing major
parts.''

   Actress Bernadette Peters couldn't refuse the
role of the mother of David Rothenberg, a boy set afire by his
vengeful father, in a based-on-fact TV movie.
   The ABC-TV movie ``David'' features Miss Peters as the
bewildered but courageous mother of the boy. The youngster survives
the motel room fire, but emerges horribly scarred.
   ``She was thrilled to get this role. The script was spectacular.
She just couldn't resist,'' Richard Grant, publicist for the
actress, said Monday.
   Miss Peters begins rehearsals this month, and filming starts
July 6 in Los Angeles, Grant said. The movie will be directed by
John Irman, best known for his AIDS movie ``An Early Frost.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Prince
Charles have joined in a campaign to win for Britain one of the
greatest private art collections in the world, according to news
reports.
   The 1,600 paintings of Swiss Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza
are regarded as the finest art collection in private hands after
that of Queen Elizabeth II. They are conservatively valued at $1.41
billion.
   There has been a fierce international competition for the
collection, with Spain regarded as the favorite. The baron,
grandson of the Ruhr steel magnate who armed the German forces in
World War I, has made a commitment to Spain to show most of his
paintings in Madrid for at least 10 years.
   But government sources in London said Monday that Mrs. Thatcher
has written the baron.
   A spokesman for the Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation said Monday
that a long-term proposal ``may have been received from the British
government,'' but no decision had been made. Its commitment to
Spain remained unaffected by any proposals from Britain, the
spokesman said.
   Prince Charles reportedly broke away from a vacation in Italy to
visit Thyssen at his Lake Lugano home May 4 to discuss the
long-term future of the collection.
   On May 21, Mrs. Thatcher sent Cabinet Secretary Sir Robin Butler
to Switzerland for further talks at the baron's home. The prime
minister followed up her offer of a purpose-built gallery for the
collection in a two-page, handwritten letter, the domestic news
agency Press Association said.
   Roger de Grey, president of Britain's Royal Academy of Arts,
said Charles and Mrs. Thatcher had done everything possible to see
that Britain did not miss a great opportunity.
   ``The intervention of Prince Charles is the sort of thing that
would count in the baron's mind,'' said de Grey.
   The Times said the 67-year-old baron has been concerned about
the disposition of the collection, begun by his father but broken
up at the order of the Swiss courts at his father's death.
   Thyssen was adamant that the collection should remain basically
intact, the Times said, in a country prepared to give it a
respectful home.
   Switzerland, West Germany and the Getty Foundation in Los
Angeles are also competing for the chance to house the collection.

   Americans wanting to sell anything from
biscuits and cigars to plumbing and whiskey often have tried to
cloak their wares in the presumed respectability of Congress and
its most illustrious members.
   Daniel Webster, for example.
   Webster, perhaps the most famous senator and orator of the
mid-19th century, had his face and his name used to promote cigars,
flour, and a concoction known as Dr. J.C. Ayres Cherry Pectoral,
promoted as a cure for coughs, colds, bronchitis, croup, whooping
cough and other ailments.
   According to a new three-case exhibit recently installed in a
Senate corridor, the claim that Webster endorsed Dr. Ayres' elixer
may have been somewhat exaggerated.
   Promoters of the product claimed that Webster praised it in 1853.
   The famed statesman died in 1852.
   The exhibit, organized by the U.S. Senate Commission on Art and
Antiquities, includes a shiny metal spatula from 1910 which
demonstrates that even 58 years after Webster's death his name
still had commercial appeal.
   Webster's features are engraved on the widest spot of the
antique pancake turner, which is also emblazoned with the words:
``Daniel Webster Flour, Better Than the Best'' and ``One Good Turn
Deserves Another.''
   Webster's face was also used on the flour bag with the words:
``Daniel Webster Flour Bakes Everything Better.''
   In an age when a cigar brought to mind a politician, Webster
also was used to promote a brand of cigars.
   Their name?
   ``Websters,'' of course.
   The names and faces of Webster's contemporaries, Sens. John C.
Calhoun of South Carolina and Henry Clay of Kentucky also were used
to peddle cigars.
   And for years, Old Crow whiskey identified itself as, ``The
Whiskey That Henry Clay Took to Washington.''
   ``From the earliest days of advertising, senators have been
known to endorse commercial products,'' notes a news release issued
by the Senate commission.
   From the beginning of the advertising age in the mid-19th
century, ``our country's enterprises have understood the power of
national legislative symbols to influence the American consumer,''
the commission said.
   The display has a title _ ``What This Country Needs'' _ taken
from the 1917 declaration of Vice President Thomas Marshall that
``What this country needs is a good five cent cigar.''
   Although Marshall did not recommend any particular brand of
nickel cigar, the exhibit makes clear that he would not have been
breaking new ground had he done so.
   A much later advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes reads:
``U.S. Sen. Gerald P. Nye Says: `I enjoy the comfort a light smoke
gives my throat.''
   The familiar image of the Capitol dome has been used, according
to the exhibit, to symbolize ``purity, wholesomeness,
respectability and success, innovation and leadership, prosperity
and celebration.''
   In one 1890's advertisement, the Capitol looms in the background
as two bearded senators are served Schlitz beer at a table
surrounded by ferns.
   ``The Capitol at Washington is painted with oxide of zinc,''
proclaims another advertisement, implying that American homeowners
would do well to use that ingredient on their own domicile.
   On display are advertisements for breakfast cereals, stationery,
soft drinks, biscuits, tires, soap, cameras, and plumbing, all
using the Capitol theme.
   One proclaims that the Durham Plumbing System has been installed
in ``the greatest building on this continent _ the Capitol at
Washington.''
   In another, fashionably dressed men, presumably senators, are
shown striding up the Senate's marble steps.
   All of this has caused an occasional raised eyebrows, and the
Arts and Antiquities Commission notes that the use of the Capitol
in commercial advertising never has been sanctioned by Congress.
   But neither has the practice been banned.
   In 1956 the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out a bill
banning the use of ``pictures of the Capitol or other public
buildings in ... advertising when it would be reasonably calculated
to convey the false impression that the company has some connection
with, or was insured by, the United States Government.''
   The measure passed the Senate.
   But the House failed to act on it.

   The search for Michael Dukakis' running mate begins in earnest
today as his manager travels to Washington to discuss prospects,
and rival George Bush courted the Cuban-American vote with some
sharp words for Fidel Castro.
   Dukakis was in Washington to address a NATO group, plugging his
alternative to President Reagan's Star Wars program and his plans
for strengthening the European alliance.
   And Jesse Jackson continued his conciliatory mood by saying he
could rally supporters behind Dukakis even if the all-but-certain
Democratic nominee did not choose Jackson for the No. 2 spot on the
ticket.
   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas, point man in the
Democrat's search for a running mate, was to spend several days in
Washington starting today to discuss vice presidential prospects.
   Campaign aides said Brountas would seek advice from members of
Congress and other Democratic Party leaders but declined to name
them.
   Dukakis gave the Atlantic Council, a private, pro-NATO group,
his assessment of the recent U.S.-Soviet summit and called for
negotiations between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries on conventional
military forces.

   ``We don't need SDI; we need CDI, the Conventional Defense
Initiative begun by leaders in the Congress to apply advanced
technology to the challenge of fighting and winning a conventional
war,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Dukakis praised the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, and he hailed President
Reagan's stance on human rights at the recent Moscow summit.
   But Dukakis also criticized the administration, saying the
United States should never again ``announce radical changes in our
strategic doctrine or adopt dramatic new bargaining positions on
nuclear weapons without consulting our allies in advance.''

   Bush met on Monday with members of the Cuban-American National
Foundation, an anti-Castro group. ``There have been no
accommodations made with Castro's corrupt communist government by
this administration and, if I may inject a partisan point, I
guarantee you there will be no accommodations'' during a Bush
presidency, he said.
   The private organization has agreed to help resettle some 4,000
Latin Americans in this country.
   Dukakis engaged in a form of one-upmanship with Bush on South
Africa after the vice president went beyond the usually tame
administration stance and labeled South Africa a ``racist state.''
   When informed of that comment, Dukakis called for an
international boycott of South Africa, saying it ``not only is
engaging in blatant racism and terrorism, it is engaging in naked
aggression against its neighbors.''
   Jackson headed from Chicago to Salt Lake City today to address
the U.S. Conference of Mayors after meeting on Monday with the
editorial boards of the Chicago Tribune and Johnson Publishing Co.,
which prints Ebony and Jet magazines.
   Even if Dukakis picks someone else, Jackson told reporters in
Chicago, the Massachusetts governor could look for backing from him
``so long as our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.''
   But Jackson noted that major differences remain, including
Dukakis' refusal to join him in supporting a military spending
freeze and tax hikes aimed at upper-income Americans.
   Jackson said he planned to deliver several major policy speeches
before the convention outlining his programs for health care,
education, the war on drugs, and foreign and defense policy.
   Dukakis was leaving behind budget troubles in the Massachusetts
Statehouse. The governor met for an hour Monday with aides and
legislative leaders in Boston about the projected $400 million
deficit his administration faces.
   Dukakis's presidential campaign has taken a hard line against
federal tax increases. One participant in the Massachusetts meeting
indicated that the possibility of new state taxes was discussed,
but no decisions were made.
   Bush received some encouraging news from the latest Harris poll,
which showed him gaining slightly on Dukakis.
   Dukakis, who held a seven-point lead in the same poll in May and
a double-digit advantage in other surveys, received 49 percent
support in the latest poll to Bush's 44 percent. Seven percent
remained uncommitted.
   The Lou Harris & Associates telephone survey of 1,258 likely
voters was conducted June 1-6. The results each had a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points, meaning the Dukakis
lead was within the margin.

<HEAD>War on Cocaine Moves into USDA Greenhouse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department greenhouse has
become the site of a million-dollar battle to find some way to
stamp out the coca plants grown illicitly in South America and
processed into cocaine, USDA officials confirm.
   The greenhouse near Washington is one of two USDA research sites
where 400 to 600 coca plants are being produced under the project,
Dr. Edward B. Knipling of the Agriculture Research Service said
Monday.
   The other is an outdoor site at an undisclosed location in the
United States where the largely tropical plants will not be hit
with frost, he said.
   He said the plants used in the experiment are incinerated
afterward and that cocaine is never produced from them. The
objective is to test herbicides to determine which ones are
effective in killing the hardy coca plants.
   Researchers earlier had grown opium poppies in Thailand and
marijuana in the United States as part of USDA's research into ways
to stem narcotics. But the priority changed two years ago because
of growing use by Americans of both cocaine and crack, a cocaine
derivative, Knipling said.
   USDA's coca production was disclosed Sunday in The New York
Times.
   Knipling estimated the cost of the program at ``about $1 million
a year.'' He said some funds come from the research service's
regular budget and the rest from the State Department.
   Guards, alarms and wire fences are being used to keep out
intruders at the installations, Knipling said. He refused to
disclose the precise whereabouts of either of the growing sites.
   Coca seeds were brought to the United States from South America,
Knipling said. He said a number of herbicides have been tested for
use against coca.
   The chief herbicide recommended to the State Department is
tebutherion, a product manufactured by Eli Lilly & Co. of
Indianapolis under the trade name Spike. Knipling said it is used
in the United States to clear brush in areas where food crops do
not grow.
   The subject of USDA's testing surfaced when the former head of
the project, Walter Gentner, told reporters he had resigned in
April to protest what he called the failure of the Agriculture and
State departments to examine thoroughly enough the potential
dangers from use of the herbicide.
   Knipling said South American cocaine production is doing far
more to endanger the environment than would use of tebutherion. He
said there was little doubt that the coca leaves were being heavily
sprayed with pesticides, which could cause harm.
   Moreover, he said, sulfuric acid and other chemicals being used
to process the coca into cocaine undoubtedly are dumped into
streams when the manufacturing process is over.
   George Dunlop, assistant secretary of agriculture for natural
resources and the environment, said coca producers, ``in their
efforts to satiate the habits of American cocaine addicts, are
doing heavy and extreme environmental damage.''
   ``They are slashing and burning the tropical rain forest'' to
clear more ground for coca planting, he said.

   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich emerged from a
visit with Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng and reported no
progress in getting the government to suspend conservation
restrictions to combat drought problems.
   ``I hope there'll be rain in the next two weeks,'' Perpich said
Monday after the session in Lyng's office.
   He said Lyng was encouraging about an emergency feed program to
help livestock producers whose hay and grazing land have been
scorched by drought but refused to lift curbs imposed under the
Conservation Reserve Program.
   That program, established in 1985, aims to take 45 million acres
out of crop production by 1990 and cover them instead with trees
and grasses. Farmers sign contracts to include such highly erodible
lands in the reserve and in exchange obtain government payments.
   USDA officials recently estimated the overall cost of the
reserve program to the taxpayers at $677 million for 1987, $1.864
billion for this year and $2.16 billion next year.
   Lyng has the power in an emergency to suspend program rules that
bar cutting hay and grazing livestock on such lands.
   Perpich said, however, that Lyng was reluctant to do so, saying
the lands involved are fragile and should remain in conservation
use.
   Under an emergency feed program, the federal government would
pay substantial costs for acquiring feed for livestock and bringing
it into the state. But local officials would have to apply for it.
   Lyng's office said he would have no comment on the session with
the Minnesotans.
   Earlier, Perpich met with Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D. The
governor said he would discuss the situation later with Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
   Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Jim Nichols said the drought
could wipe out as much as half of the state's crops and that the
cost to the hardest hit counties in that case would total $400
million.
   ``There just is no hay in Minnesota,'' he said. He said that
opening the Conservation Reserve Program acreage would cost the
taxpayers nothing while putting an emergency feed program in effect
would carry a price tag.

   Cuba has added a new dimension to the complex
conflict in southern Africa by constructing a military air base in
southern Angola just a few minutes flying time from South
African-controlled Namibia, according to U.S. officials.
   The construction of the base in support of increased Cuban troop
strength in southern Angola appears to have heightened the
possibility of an eventual clash between Cuban and South African
forces, the officials said.
   In addition to Namibia, South Africa also has forces in Angola
supporting a U.S.-backed anti-communist rebel group.
   The presence of the Cuban troops within 10 miles of the Namibian
border prompted South Africa to call up army reserves last week.
The South Africans say the Cuban forces, interspersed with Namibian
guerrillas fighting for independence, are spread across a 280-mile
front.
   According to the officials, who asked not to be identified, Cuba
appears to be jockeying for position as talks aimed at reaching a
negotiated settlement intensify.
   President Fidel Castro informed a gathering of Third World
foreign ministers meeting in Havana two weeks ago of the
construction of the air base.
   ``We now have air superiority and anti-air superiority,'' Cuban
news accounts of Castro's comments said.
   ``We have the means to confront any South African adventure,''
he said. U.S. officials said the air strip under construction
appears capable of handling MiG-23 jet fighters.
   In early May, South Africa joined the United States and a joint
Angolan-Cuban delegation in London for unprecedented peace talks.
   The U.S. objective is achieving an agreement that will lead to
South Africa's withdrawal from both Angola and Namibia and the
withdrawal of the estimated 43,000 to 45,000 Cuban troops from
Angola.
   Castro said South Africa's willingness to negotiate was the
result of the Cuban troop deployment near the Namibian border.
   Also part of the equation is the American-backed rebel movement
in Angola which has been fighting that country's Marxist government
for 13 years. But the United States considers that issue to be an
internal Angolan problem which should not be part of the
negotiating effort.
   All sides said the London talks were constructive and they
agreed to meet again. There has been no agreement as yet on a site.
   The parties to the conflict are far apart on a timetable for
reaching a settlement. Cuba and Angola have set out a four-year
timetable for the withdrawal of the Cuban troops while insisting on
a one-year process leading to black majority rule and independence
for Namibia as well as the withdrawal of South African occupation
forces from the territory. The independence process for Namibia is
spelled out in a U.N. Security Council resolution.
   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush pledged on Monday that, if
elected, he will make ``no accommodations'' with Cuba.
   He made the statement at a ceremony formalizing an agreement
with the Cuban-American National Foundation that will permit the
immigration to the United States of about 1,500 Cubans living in
third countries.
   The Foundation, an anti-Castro group, has agreed to pay the
costs of resettling the Cubans in the United States.

<HEAD>Pioneer 10 Still Sending Back Data Five Years After Leaving Solar

   After 16 years and more than 4
billion miles, Pioneer 10 is still speeding toward interstellar
space and perhaps for the next decade should continue to provide
clues to some of the puzzles of the universe, scientists said.
   The little spacecraft, which left the solar system five years
ago, has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its original
mission to study Jupiter and the asteroid belt, scientists said.
   The 570-pound Pioneer 10 is relaying strong evidence to suggest
a mysterious Planet X or possibly two smaller planets exist beyond
Pluto, John D. Anderson of the National Aeronautics and Space
Adminstration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Monday.
   ``We have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that Uranus and Neptune
are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet
X,'' he said.
   Anderson and other scientists reported on Pioneer 10 to observe
the fifth anniversary of the craft's leaving the known solar system.
   The probe was launched in 1972 and traveled an arc-shaped, 620
million mile path from Earth before making its closest approach to
Jupiter _ 82,000 miles _ on Dec. 3, 1973.
   Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt,
between Mars and Jupiter, and fly by Jupiter and return pictures.
It also was the first to chart the giant planet's intense radiation
belts and measure the mass of its four planet-size moons. Data from
Pioneer 10 showed that Jupiter is predominantly liquid.
   Its twin, Pioneer 11, was launched in 1973, encountered Jupiter
a year later and reached Saturn in September 1979.
   Scientists said Pioneer 10 is expected to operate another seven
to 10 years and may run out of energy before it reaches
interstellar space.
   Until then, the spacecraft will keep looking for long gravity
waves proposed by Albert Einstein, and may give scientists clues to
the shape of the heliosphere, the boundary of the sun's influence.
   ``One of the principal current objectives is the observation of
cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored
distances from the sun,'' said physicist James Van Allen of the
University of Iowa, a principal investigator on the project.
   ``We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer
boundary of the heliosphere ... and of penetrating into the nearby
interstellar media,'' said Van Allen, who discovered radiation
belts surrounding Earth.
   Pioneer 10 is now sending back radio signals from a distance 45
times the distance between the Earth and sun.
   The energy picked up by a 230-foot deep space antenna would have
to be stored for over 11 billion years to accumulate enough energy
to light a 7{-watt nightlight for one millisecond, said Richard O.
Fimmel, project manager at the NASA Ames Research Center.
   But the signals from Pioneer 10 and 11 are strong enough to send
high quality data on a daily basis, Van Allen said.

   Consumer groups are criticizing a compromise
bill fashioned by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, saying
the measure will make it harder for victims of unsafe products to
recover damages from manufacturers.
   Both sides in the protracted struggle between business and
consumer lobbyists agree, however, that there is virtually no
chance the so-called product liability bill will pass Congress in
this election year.
   The measure will go next to the House Judiciary Committee, which
shares jurisdiction over the issue but has balked at approving such
legislation in the past. Even if it manages to reach the House _
which many congressional observers doubt _ the Senate is considered
a graveyard for product liability bills.
   The measure, eagerly sought by corporations worried about
escalating liability costs, would impose a uniform federal standard
of liability pre-empting a wide variety of conflicting state laws.
   Consumer activists complain that the new proposed federal
standard would limit victims of hazardous products to six narrow
grounds for suing manufacturers for damages: negligence,
intentional wrongdoing, defect design, defective construction,
inadequate warnings and breach of written warranty.
   Another major feature contested by consumer advocates is the
``state of the art'' defense available to manufacturers.
   This provision says that a manufacturer can escape liability for
damages if it can prove it did not know _ or could not know _ of a
design defect with knowledge ``reasonably available to experts,''
or if there were no feasible alternative design.
   A pro-consumer ``escape hatch'' sponsored by Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., would require only that the plaintiff prove that the
product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should
not have been marketed. The committee also accepted Synar's
proposal easing the standard of proof that plaintiffs must meet.
   The Synar provision also would put a burden of proof on the
manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be discovered
and that an alternative design was not feasible.
   Consumer lobbyists are unhappy, though, with Synar's proposal to
give a judge not a trial jury _ the responsibility for deciding
whether a product was so unsafe it should never have been marketed.
   Even with Synar's softening of the pro-business features of the
original bill, consumer groups say the measure undermines the legal
doctrine of ``strict liability'' used by 47 states and favored by
victim advocates.
   That doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the
manufacturer's alleged misconduct to the defective product itself,
relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or
should have known about its product.
   Consumer lobbyists argue that even though the bill makes strict
liability a national standard in deciding damage suits, it is
weakened by including a state-of-the-art defense against
manufacturers' liability, which currently is allowed in only eight
states.
   Not covered by the bill are tobacco, alcohol and asbestos. Those
products would continue to be subject to generally more stringent
state liability laws.
   The bill also includes a provision backed by anti-abortionists
that would deny special protection to any drug or contraceptive
device that induces abortions.

   A federal judge is deliberating whether to
shut down an exhibition of giant pandas at an Ohio zoo because of
complaints from a wilflife group the endangered animals are being
commercially exploited.
   U.S. District Judge Norma Johnson was urged Monday by the World
Wildlife Fund to issue a preliminary injunction shutting down the
exhibition at the Toledo Zoo.
   Since May 24, the zoo has been exhibiting two pandas on loan
from China after receiving a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Bruce Berman, an attorney for the wildlife fund, argued the
federal agency should not have issued the permit because it failed
to find that the importation of the pandas was not primarily for
commercial purposes and that it would promote survival of the
species.
   James Kilbourne, an attorney for the wildlife service, said the
agency determined that import of the pandas would not be
detrimental to their survival and that while the exhibit would have
some commercial trappings, it was not primarily for commercial
purposes.
   Ellen Efros, an attorney for the zoo, said the separate
admission fee for the panda exhibit was established only for
financial accountability purposes.
   Ms. Efros said closing the exhibit would rob the public of a
chance to view an endangered species and learn something about
China. And she said it could have a potentially harmful effect on
U.S.-Chinese relations.

<HEAD>After Three Years, Vivid Memories Remain For TWA Flight's
Passengers, Crew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years ago today, two young men who could
have passed for well-dressed college students hijacked TWA flight
847 shortly after it took off from Athens. Their act launched a
dramatic episode that lasted for 17 days.
   By the time it was over, 39 men had been held hostage in Beirut
for two weeks, a young Navy diver was dead and the plane had logged
more than 8,500 miles between Greece, Lebanon and Algeria.
   For the 153 passengers and crew _ 104 of the American _ the
ordeal is something they will never forget, though many have tried.
   ``It wasn't a fun deal to go through,'' said Robert Peel, 36, of
Hutchinson, Kan. ``We really don't like to talk about it because
every time you do, it brings it up again.''
   John Mazurowski, 68, of Lancaster, N.Y., said the hijacking ``is
an issue we would like to forget.'' Mazurowski's daughter, Melissa,
a recent graduate of Barnard College, still has back trouble as a
result of the 30 hours they spent on the plane, her father said.
   William Cocoris, a restaurant owner from Boston, Mass., said he
no longer flies on American carriers when he visits his family in
Greece. ``I think we are targeted,'' he said.
   Memories have been evoked recently by a television film about
the flight, a book by the pilot and news reports about the upcoming
trial in Germany of one of the hijackers.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is scheduled to be tried in Frankfurt July 5
on charges of air piracy and murder in the death of Robert D.
Stethem of Waldorf, Md.. The young Navy man was beaten and shot
during the hijacking.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite thought to have ties to the radical
group, Hezbollah, was arrested in January 1987 as he went through
customs with explosives in his luggage. The United States tried
unsuccessfully to extradite him.
   Court spokesman Falk Thomas said two of Stethem's relatives and
six former hostages will take part in the prosecution. Stethem's
parents could not be reached for comment.
   Another suspect, Hassan Izz-Al-Din, was identified by passengers
as one of the people who hijacked a Kuwaiti Airways plane earlier
this year, according to a State Department official who asked that
he not be named. The department does not have official
confirmation, he said.
   On May 2, NBC-TV aired a two-hour docudrama about the episode
entitled, ``The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story.''
Actress Lindsay Wagner played Derickson, the purser on the flight
who had close contact with the hijackers because she translated
their demands from German into English during the flight.
   Mazurowski said the movie was ``quite factual'' though it tended
to glamorize parts of the ordeal.
   Helen Sheahan, a TWA flight attendant who has a vivid
recollection of the events, said she was disappointed with what she
called distortions in the movie. For instance, she said none of the
passengers talked during the flight, but the film shows Stethem
discussing with a friend what to do.
   ``The truth would have been just as compelling,'' she said.
   Capt. John L. Testrake of Richmond, Mo., wrote a book last year
about the hijacking which he dedicated to Stethem.
   ``He looked at hate and death squarely and fearlessly, and no
cry was heard to come from him,'' Testrake wrote in ``Triumph Over
Terror on Flight 847,'' published by Fleming H. Revell Co.
   ``I cannot describe how I felt when Stethem was killed,'' he
said. ``There was just a heavy, heavy sadness that washed over me.''
   In the book, which deals heavily with Testrake's religious
faith, the retired TWA pilot said he knew little about the politics
of the Middle East until the hijacking.
   ``I was awakened from this typically American isolation by the
black bore of an automatic pistol in my face and by the angry eyes
behind it,'' he said. ``I have discovered that our country is
resented in this region...''
   TWA spokesman Bob Blattner in St. Louis, Mo., said he had no
information about any settlements offered to passengers on flight
847. One former hostage said in 1985 the company offered $35,000 to
passengers held until the end of the 17-day crisis, and $15,000 to
those released earlier.

<HEAD>House OKs Measure On Middlemen's Handling Of Toxic PCBs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving to close a loophole in the
control of PCBs, the highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls that
were banned in 1976.
   A bill passed by the House by voice vote Monday takes direct aim
at PCB brokers, the middlemen who collect the chemicals from their
use sites and arrange for their destruction.
   While the use and destruction of PCBs are heavily regulated,
there has been no governmental control over them between the time
brokers pick them up and when they deliver them to a destruction
facility, such as an incinerator.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said the bill that moved to the
Senate responds to reports that some brokers have improperly
handled PCBs and in some instances have gone bankrupt, leaving
power companies and communities to clean up storage sites.
   ``Literally, anyone with a truck can now get into the PCB
disposal business,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., a principal
sponsor of the bill. ``It's time to put an end to the sham these
PCB operators have put on us. It's time to put them out of
business.''
   PCBs are most frequently found as an insulation fluid in heavy
duty electrical equipment. Congress banned their manufacture in
1976, but an estimated 750 million pounds are still in use or in
storage.
   Luken said that as the electrical gear wears out over the next
few years, the nation will be faced with the task of safely
disposing of a growing amount of the chemicals.
   The bill would require PCB brokers to be registered, keep
records and demonstrate financial responsibility.

<HEAD>Lightning Deaths in 1987 Highest This Decade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lightning deaths around the nation last year
rose to the highest level in this decade, and the rate of
lightning-related injuries was nearly 50 percent higher than usual,
according to new government figures.
   Twice in 1987 lightning claimed three lives with a single bolt _
in New York and Tennessee, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reported Monday.
   One Maine youth wasn't even safe at home, in bed and under the
covers. On July 31 a bolt struck his home in Nantucket County,
traveled down a wall and knocked the 19-year-old out of bed.
   That youth was among 365 people hurt during the year, well above
the 250 annual average. Eighty-six were killed _ the most since 88
died in 1978.
   But the total was still short of the annual average of 96
deaths. Lightning deaths have been declining in recent years,
dipping to a record low of 68 fatalities in 1986 before rebounding
last year.
   ``Lightning apparently does not command the respect it deserves
as a dangerous killer,'' E. W. Friday, director of the National
Weather Service, warned in a statement. Among weather-related
hazards, only flash floods kill more people annually than
lightning, he said.
   Three golfers taking shelter under a tall tree on a hill were
killed July 3 at Warrior's Path State Park near Kingsport, Tenn.
   And on July 26, lightning killed three campers sleeping in tents
at Darien Lake in Genesee County, N.Y. Scorch marks indicated that
the bolt first struck the aluminum pole of one tent, killing its
two occupants, then jumped six feet to another tent and
electrocuted the third person.
   On the same day a 28-year-old man was killed and three others
injured at Lake Russell, Ga., when struck while in a tent located
near a tall tree.
   And just four days later a similar instance injured but spared
the lives of three campers in New York state. Three girls were in a
tent in New Scotland, in Albany County, when a bolt struck a nearby
tree and traveled through the root system to their tent where it
melted a sleeping bag and left all three with burns.
   A father and son camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in
Lake County, Minn., were killed July 24 when lightning hit a white
pine 20 feet from their tent. Two other people were burned.
   Last year's high injury list included instances in which a
strike injured a group of people.
   Some 30 people in Chicago Heights, Ill., were injured in a
single strike July 29, for example, when lightning hit a tree and
then bounced to a metal gate where people were leaving a ball game.
Some people were knocked four or five feet and two were seriously
injured.
   In another case, on Aug. 12, 24 were injured in Silver City,
N.M., when a bolt hit a high school football field near a group of
players. The injuries, which included 18 football players, were
mostly minor burns.
   Seven people sitting under a tree in Green County, Ohio were
injured by a lightning strike July 11.
   A half-dozen national guardsmen were injured Aug. 4 when a bolt
struck during a night exercise at Fort McClellan, Ala., while on
July 24 five Coast Guardsmen standing on a seawall at Port Huron,
Mich., were injured by a bolt.
   Overall, nearly one-third of the people injured were affected by
just nine strikes.
   As usual, Florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last
year. Tennessee ranked second with 6, followed by 5 in New Mexico
and 4 each in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York
and North Carolina.
   Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey,
Oklahoma and South Carolina each recorded three fatalities. There
were two each in Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah and Virginia.
Recording a single lightning death for the year were Washington,
D.C.; Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and South Dakota.
   In addition to deaths and injuries, extensive property damage
was caused by lightning each year. For example, lightning strikes
kindled more than 900 fires in Oregon last August, laying waste to
130,000 acres of forest land in the worst fire since the so-called
Telbrook Burn in 1921.
   A lightning strike doesn't always mean a fire, though. On July 1
a bolt ruptured the Salem, S.C., water tower, causing a spill of
100,000 gallons.

   A reporter investigating allegations of
abuse at a jail was charged Monday with illegally taking papers
from prisoners.
   Karen E. Olson of the Tallahassee Democrat took papers from one
of four prisoners she interviewed Saturday and refused to hand them
over to jail officials, Leon County sheriff's officials charged.
   Removing contraband from a correctional facility is a
third-degree felony that carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison, said sheriff's Maj. Larry Campbell.
   The newspaper said it had employed Ms. Olson, 34, as a reporter
since 1982, and that she has been investigating prisoners at the
jail since April.
   ``The Democrat fully supports her and has supported her with
legal counsel. We believe the judicial process will vindicate
her,'' Managing Editor Bill Fuller said Monday night in a statement.
   Ms. Olson surrendered at the sheriff's office Monday afternoon
and was charged, booked and released on her own recognizance.
   Gary Williams, one of two lawyers representing Ms. Olson, said
Monday that there are ``significant constitutional problems with
the statute'' under which the reporter was charged, raising
``significant First Amendment issues.''
   Williams said he tried to discuss those issues with Sheriff
Eddie Boone on Monday but Boone declined to do so.
   ``We're obviously going to have to discuss them in court now,
and that's where I feel Karen Olson will be fully vindicated,''
Williams said.

<HEAD>Holding The Nation's Last Primary: Not A Lot Of Glory For North
Dakota</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Most states took a turn in the 1988
campaign spotlight when their presidential primaries rolled around.
The candidates came, the reporters followed, the television lights
went on, and at least fifteen minutes of fame ensued.
   But not in North Dakota.
   The state, which held the first presidential primary in the
nation in 1912, holds the final presidential primary of the year
today.
   This should be worth a little attention, right?
   Wrong.
   No Democrats bothered to file. On the Republican side, the
ballot lists only George Bush and Mary Jane Rachner, a retired
Minnesota teacher who says the spirits of her late mother and
grandmother told her to run for president.
   The primary ``doesn't really mean anything,'' concedes Jim
Schlosser, co-chairman of Bush's campaign in North Dakota.
   The vice president long ago wrapped up the 1,139 delegates
needed to win the GOP nomination, and North Dakota's 16 delegates
are expected to follow the crowd.
   Bush underscored the insignificance of North Dakota's primary
during a speech in Denver over the weekend that was telecast via
satellite to a North Dakota Republican Party meeting.
   ``The primary process is over on both sides,'' Bush said.
   ``They're worthless,'' Secretary of State Ben Meier, one of the
Republican leaders at the meeting, said afterwards of North
Dakota's presidential primaries.
   Even so, Meier predicts as many as 100,000 voters will go to the
polls Tuesday, but only because of ballot measures that would
create a state lottery and repeal a tax on cable television service.
   ``People would be more interested in voting in the primary, if
there was a reason to be there,'' said state GOP Director Gary
Emineth.
   North Dakota conducted the nation's first presidential primary
March 19, 1912. But the primary was dropped from 1932 until it was
revived by the 1979 Legislature, which saw the election as a way to
attract national attention to the state.
   The primary was as insignificant when it returned in 1984 after
the 52-year absence as it is this year. By almost all accounts, the
primary season this year wrapped up a week ago with contests in
California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   ``It would have been nice if North Dakota had more impact,''
state Sen. Ray Holmberg, a Republican who led the effort to
resurrect the presidential primary, said wistfully. ``Maybe the
next time they will.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Budget Crunch Prompts Talk Of New Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when the presidential campaign of Michael
Dukakis is trying to dampen any talk about Democrats raising taxes,
the Massachusetts governor is being forced to consider the
possibility at home.
   Dukakis met Monday with senior budget advisers and legislative
leaders to talk about his state's budget crunch, and one
participant in the meeting indicated the possibility of new taxes
was discussed.
   Senate President William Bulger and House Speaker George
Keverian both said spending and tax issues were discussed, but no
conclusions were drawn.
   Asked if the possibility of new taxes was talked about, Bulger
said, ``Every kind of idea is being discussed.''
   Dukakis, speaking to reporters briefly on his way out of the
Statehouse, also declined to provide any specifics.
   ``It will evolve, it will develop. We are talking about a number
of things,'' the governor said.
   Dukakis was asked about the growing belief by some that higher
taxes are inevitable.
   ``I don't know if that's true at this point. We've got lots of
things we are looking at and we are making good progress. And we
will have a good, solid balanced budget,'' he said.
   The governor also declined to say whether he has asked the
legislative leaders to support any new or higher taxes.
   With less than three weeks remaining in the fiscal year, the
Dukakis administration is facing a projected deficit of more than
$400 million. And budget experts in the administration and in the
legislature say the next fiscal year could hold more problems.
   The House has passed an $11.8 billion spending plan for next
year, and that budget is pending in the Senate. The new budget is
due on July 1.
   The legislative leaders said Monday's discussions with the
governor did not focus on any particular deadline, although they
acknowledged that the problem is urgent and more meetings are
planned this week.
   ``We're running against the clock, but I'm sure we will meet our
timetables,'' Keverian said. He, too, declined to reveal details of
what was discussed in the meeting.
   In recent weeks, Dukakis has spoken repeatedly with top
lawmakers, seeking to reach a broad agreement balancing the budget
for both this year and next, in time to meet the July 1 deadline.
   Finance Secretary Frank Keefe said there was no consensus yet on
where to cut spending or on which new taxes or fees might be needed.
   Keefe said he was urging Dukakis to sign a bill projected to
raise $40 million by imposing a sales tax on cigarettes, which
arrived on the governor's desk Monday. But he said he could not
predict what Dukakis will do.
   In the course of his presidential campaign, Dukakis has leaned
heavily on his reputation as a competent manager who has kept his
state's budget balanced.
   The Dukakis campaign has also resisted calls from Jesse Jackson
to raise taxes on the wealthy, a position Jackson would like to see
included in the Democratic platform.
   Dukakis has said tax hikes should be a last resort, and that a
crackdown on tax cheats should be a first step.

<HEAD>Reagan Nominee Hit for Placing Liens on Dying AIDS Victim's
Property</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Reagan administration judicial nominee is
under fire for placing liens on the property of a dying AIDS victim
and for his membership in a private club with a record of
discrimination.
   Vaughn R. Walker, nominee for a U.S. district judgeship in
northern California, was accused by another lawyer during a hearing
Monday of keeping property liens ``hanging over a dying man.''
   Walker also was questioned sharply by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy on
his continued membership in San Francisco's Olympic Club.
   Walker, a member of a large San Francisco law firm, said he
would resign unless more blacks were recruited and women members
were given voting rights.
   Leahy, D-Vt., who presided at the Judiciary Committee's
confirmation hearing, reminded the San Francisco lawyer that
Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy quit the same club without
waiting for changes.
   But the most emotional issue at the hearing was Walker's
representation of the U.S. Olympic Committee in its successful suit
to stop an organizer for San Francisco's gay community from calling
an athletic competition the ``Gay Olympics.''
   As part of the suit, Walker placed liens on the property of the
late Tom Waddell, a 1968 Olympian in the decathlon who spent the
last years of his life fighting the USOC's lawsuit before dying of
AIDS.
   Attorney Mary Dunlap, who represented Waddell, said Walker
placed the liens on Waddell's property and refused to lift them
even when he knew Waddell was dying.
   Walker insisted there was ``nothing malicious'' in placing the
liens against Waddell's home and other property, an action that
followed a federal district judge's order that Waddell and a gay
organization pay the USOC's $96,000 in attorney's fees.
   Walker told the committee that a later federal appeals court
ruling during the case automatically vacated the liens.
   But Ms. Dunlap told the committee that she was unable to vacate
the liens without Walker's release, which he refused to give.
Walker eventually gave his agreement, but the liens were not
removed until six days after Waddell's death in July 1987.
   Ms. Dunlap said Walker left the liens ``hanging over a dying man
at the time he needed to know his daughter would inherit his
estate.''
   Discussing his club membership, Walker said he has been working
from within to get the Olympic Club to change its policies. He said
it now has an accelerated program to recruit minorities, and
discussions are under way to permit the 800 women members to vote _
a privilege they do not have now.
   The nominee first told senators that he would resign if the
committee asked him to do so. Told by Leahy that there were no
plans for such a request, Walker said that if the current efforts
stall and a ``hopeless situation'' results, ``then I would resign
regardless of whether the committee thought I should resign or
not.''
   But he added, ``I think the club is making progress.''
   Walker has drawn opposition from San Francisco's gay community
and the city's Board of Supervisors, which voted unanimously
against the nomination. His main supporter, Republican Sen. Pete
Wilson of California, urged the committee not to turn against
Walker because of the U.S. Olympic Committee case.
   ``What principle of American jurisprudence is more fundamental
than that due process of the law requires that however unpopular a
client, that client and that client's cause of action are entitled
to be represented by competent counsel?'' Wilson asked.
   Walker used similar language in defending himself, telling Leahy
``I was perfectly aware of how unpopular the position was.'' But he
added that the committee should be looking for judicial candidates
``willing to take stands'' that are legally correct ``even though
they may be unpopular.''
   Walker said the Olympic committee held firm on the lien, adding
it did so in the hope that the gay organization working with
Waddell _ San Francisco Arts and Athletics _ would raise the money
for the attorney fees.
   Leahy also used the hearing to respond to an accusation last
month by the committee's ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, that majority Democrats were intentionally delaying
13 current and former Reagan judicial nominees.
   Leahy, who is in charge of judicial confirmation hearings, said
the Justice Department caused some delays through tardiness in
responding to committee information requests on nominees.
   He said other delays resulted because Democrats want to
investigate nominees thoroughly ``before they are given a lifetime
charter to sit in judgment on the rights and liberties of the
American people, not afterwards.''

<HEAD>Shultz Avoids Soviet Disarmament Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz told
the United Nations it will have no role in superpower nuclear
weapons reductions and he ignored the Soviet Union's invitation to
ban nuclear tests.
   Shultz, addressing a special U.N. session on disarmament Monday,
instead stressed the momentum for arms control achieved during the
Reagan administration.
   ``We have made major progress toward a treaty to cut U.S. and
Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals (long-range missiles) by 50
percent,'' he said. ``I do not know whether we will be able to
conclude such a treaty this year, but we will make our best effort.
   ``It is the United States' top arms control priority,'' he added.
   Shultz's speech underlined past accomplishments, including the
newly ratified U.S.-Soviet treaty to destroy intermediate-range
nuclear missiles and the verification procedures that go with it.
   Last week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze used a
speech to the conference to call on the United States to take on
future disarmament challenges.
   He proposed abolishing all nuclear weapons by the year 2000, an
immediate mutual ban on nuclear tests and an immediate cut of
500,000 troops each from the Warsaw Pact and NATO.
   Shultz replied that the United States will ``concentrate on
results which will eliminate the disparities (in conventional arms
in Europe) that threaten stability, not schemes for `equal
reductions' which will have no such effect.''
   NATO claims the Soviets have an advantage in conventional arms
in Europe.
   In the speech, Shultz also ignored the Soviet call for a mutual
test ban.
   The United States similarly failed to join a 1{-year unilaterial
Soviet moratorium on testing that began in August 1985.
   Shultz also rejected the Soviet call for a U.N. arms reduction
verification agency to coordinate and monitor disarmament pacts.
   ``Some tasks, such as work to reduce nuclear arsenals, must be
strictly bilateral, in negotiation, verification, and
implementation.''
   ``But others,'' Shultz said, ``above all, the negotiations to
ban chemical weapons, and the need to control nuclear proliferation
_ are global problems.''
   Shultz offered no specific proposals on those problems.
   ``Ballistic missile proliferation is a new and urgent
challenge,'' particularly in the Middle East, said Shultz. His
advice to Iran and Iraq was to exercise ``mutual restraint'' and
not buy or launch such missiles.
   Shultz urged nations attending the Conference on Disarmament to
``apply themselves'' to a global ban on chemical weapons, which are
easily made in fertilizer and pesticide factories, but did not
suggest any solutions.
   The potential spread of nuclear weapons to other countries,
especially in South Asia, is a central topic in the U.N.'s session
on disarmament and Shultz urged rivals Pakistan and India to work
on the problem.
   Earlier in the day, Pakistan offered to sign the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty if India does so simultaneously.
   Later this week, delegates to the 159-member General Assembly
will begin drafting resolutions on chemical, nuclear, conventional
and space-based weapons for this third special session on
disarmament in 10 years.
   The session, scheduled to end June 25, has been sharply divided.
Diplomatic observers said it will be difficult to draft a final
document.
   The United States and Western allies have called for pragmatic
steps in arms control, respect for nuclear deterrence, a limited
role for the United Nations and recognition that bilateral arms
talks must supersede multilateral efforts.
   Western diplomats also have said that conventional disarmament
is as important as nuclear disarmament, and urged poor developing
nations that clamor for nuclear disarmament to cut their own armies
and avoid sweeping and utopian disarmament proposals.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham has lost a
mistrial bid on the eve of closing arguments in his trial on
charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Attorneys were to give closing arguments this morning, and the
jury was expected to begin deliberations in the afternoon.
   Mecham and his brother, Willard, are charged in the Maricopa
County Superior Court trial with concealing the $350,000 loan in
financial reports required by the state.
   In a motion for mistrial, defense attorney Michael Scott
contended that Judge Michael Ryan may have prejudiced the case by
expressing surprise when the prosecution and defense said Friday
they had no more witnesses.
   The defense rested its case without calling either Evan or
Willard Mecham to the stand. After the prosecution said it had no
rebuttal witnesses, Ryan told the jurors the sudden close of
testimony had taken him by surprise.
   Scott argued Monday that the judge's statement could be
interpreted by the jury as implying that the defense should have
presented more testimony or put the defendants on the stand.
   But Ryan said he made the comment in the context of the trial
schedule. In addition, he said he did not see how the defense could
be harmed since he made the remark afterthe prosecution said it had
no rebuttal witnesses.
   Ryan also denied a defense request Monday that he interview each
juror privately to find out if any had seen any publicity about the
case.
   Mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in
prison if convicted. Willard Mecham, who was his younger brother's
1986 campaign treasurer, faced three similar counts and up to 9{
years in prison if convicted.
   The defense has contended the $350,000 loan from developer Barry
Wolfson was properly reported as part of a $465,000 lump sum listed
as a contribution from Mecham, and that the failure to itemize the
loan was an innocent mistake.
   Former top Mecham aide Edith Richardson said the loan was common
knowledge among the former Republican governor's inner circle. But
two other former top aides, Donna Carlson and Mac Matheson, said
they did not know about it.
   The prosecution has said that Mecham badly needed the loan to
keep his gubernatorial campaign afloat but wanted to keep it secret
to avoid harming the candidate's theme of being ``beholden to no
one.''
   In addition, prosecutors said it didn't matter whether Mecham's
closest aides knew about the loan because it was not reported to
the public.
   Mecham took office in January 1987 and was removed April 4 when
the state Senate convicted him of two unrelated charges. He also
was impeached in connection with the loan, but the Senate decided
not to hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial.

   State troopers removed dozens of children
from a church whose fundamentalist preacher was arrested twice
Monday after harboring youngsters in defiance of a court order.
   About 60 state troopers, local police and sheriff's deputies
moved into Bethel Baptist Church after a 4-hour standoff. At least
seven people, including the assistant pastor of the church, were
arrested.
   After interviews, 11 children were handed over to state welfare
officials. It was unclear if they had been residents of the Rev.
Herman Fountain's 28-acre Bethel Home for Children, where officials
charge youngsters have been abused through corporal punishment.
   Witnesses said at least three dozen children were taken from the
church. Authorities said they took all the youngsters away after
church officials refused to point out three who Fountain
acknowledged in court had returned to the home after it was
temporarily closed by a judge.
   As the children were being taken into the local courthouse,
Fountain got into a shoving match with a lawman and was re-arrested.
   He was arrested earlier along with two staff members and a
17-year-old when a fight broke out at the home, leading Chancery
Judge Robert Oswald to call for a grand jury to consider indicting
Fountain.
   Fountain had refused to answer the judge's questions about
runaways from the home in a hearing earlier Monday. The judge
issued 11 subpoenas to staff members of the home, apparently
leading somehow to the fight.
   On Friday, the judge had given state welfare officials temporary
custody of youngsters at the home, on the campus of the independent
Bethel Baptist Church near Lucedale. The state Department of Public
Welfare removed some 60 children, but many others fled.
   Oswald ruled that children, ages 10 to 17, had been subjected
``to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to
imprisonment.''
   ``This court's message is simple _ abuse and neglect of children
is not acceptable at any time or any place by any person,'' Oswald
said.
   Oswald said that Fountain was wrong to think that since his
school is part of his church he isn't subject to civil authorities.
   The judge said he would first decide the cases of 12 children
whose parents retained a lawyer and refused to sign an agreement
not to send their youngsters back to the home.
   During a morning break, Fountain said he believed his home
housed ``about 120 children.''
   Twenty-two of 64 children taken into custody by state workers
were released over the weekend to their parents or guardians, state
Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain said Monday outside the court.
   Brittain said some of the 42 had been brought to court Monday
but they never testified.
   Asked about the children unaccounted for, Fountain said:
   ``I don't know anything about them. If I had enough money to
hire a private investigator to find them, I would do that. I love
those kids.''
   Fountain said he feared for the safety of the missing youngsters
because most had a troubled history; he was worried, he said, some
might return to using drugs.
   About 50 people attended the court session, some wearing
pro-Fountain buttons that read ``Eternal Life Is a Free Gift.''
   After several outbursts in the court that included moans, crying
and comments that the judge was prejudicial, Oswald said: ``There
is a place for demonstrations, but it is not the courtroom. There
may be a place for outcries, but it is not the courtroom.''
   Outside court, several parents said they wanted their children
back in the home rather than in the state's custody.
   Pat Green of Boca Raton, Fla., who said she had a 16-year-old
son at Bethel, said she and her husband refused to pick him up
because they did not want to sign the agreement that would bar him
from return to Bethel.
   ``We chose to have our children in a religious facility that
works,'' she said. ``And the state has put their hands in it ...
the state is taking away our rights.
   ``Brother Fountain through Bethel saved our child's life. When a
child is on drugs, you need the help of religion to get off drugs.''

   A man wearing camouflage clothing and
carrying a gun that fires paint balls was arrested by a SWAT team
that shot out his car's tires in a department store parking lot,
authorities said.
   No one was injured.
   Passers-by who thought the gun was a high-powered rifle called
about 11:15 a.m. Monday to report Mark A. Lagana, 29, of Lakewood,
sitting in his car outside a Fedco store, Los Angeles County
sheriff's Deputy Richard Dinsmoor said.
   A special weapons team spent three hours watching Lagana, then
fired three shots into the rear tires of his car as he started to
drive it out of the parking space, Dinsmoor said.
   Lagana surrendered immediately and was held for psychiatric
evaluation, Dinsmoor said. The gun, of a type used in simulated
battles, was confiscated.

<TEXT>
   In a new effort to end the Palestinian
anti-occupation uprising, Israel plans to force Gaza Strip parents
to post cash bonds to free children detained in clashes with
Israeli troops.
   Police, meanwhile, announced that they would step up aerial
patrols to spot arsonists. A tenth Arab arson suspect was seized
Monday night as he fled a burning wooded area near Jerusalem,
Israeli radio reported.
   A military source said that to curb the daily violence in the
occupied Gaza Strip, authorities would make parents of detained
children deposit cash bonds rather than promissory notes to keep
their youngsters off the streets.
   The death count continued to mount in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where Palestinians have for six months been revolting
against the 21-year Israeli occupation.
   Israeli soldiers fatally shot 43-year-old Mahmoud Hussein in the
West Bank village of Abwein near Ramallah on Monday when he did not
heed an order to halt, said Dr. Yasser Obeid, director of the
Ramallah hospital.
   The victim's family said Hussein was hard of hearing and
probably did not hear the order.
   A military spokesman said the army was checking into the death,
which brought the total number of Palestinian fatalities in the
uprising to 207. Two Israelis have been slain.
   The military source who reported the cash-bond plan said Gaza
City parents would have to pay 5,000 shekels, about $3,100, to
obtain the release of their children detained for the first time.
The money would be confiscated as a fine if the children were
detained a second time, he said.
   Previously, families could sign a document guaranteeing to pay
the amount if the suspects were arrested again after being released.
   ``It has to be seen in the context of a whole series of actions
we have taken to reduce violence,'' said the source, who was not
idenfitied in line with army regulations.
   An Arab resident of Gaza said new fines amounting to the
equivalent of $9,500 against homeowners whose houses were painted
with Palestine Liberation Organization slogans have virtually
eliminated such graffiti.
   ``When people see writing on the wall they take it off and do a
whitewash _ they're frightened and don't want to put themselves in
trouble,'' said the resident, who asked not to be named in fear of
reprisal.
   Officials reported more brush and forest fires Monday night in
central Israel, and they blamed Palestinian arsonists.
   Fires in recent weeks have destroyed at least 25,000 acres of
grazing areas, forests and nature reserves, according to
naturalists.
   Police reported the arrest Monday night of a 26-year-old Arab
suspected of committing arson in the Ben-Shemen park along the Tel
Aviv-Jerusalem highway.
   They said a second forest fire was set near the Orthodox Kefar
Habad Hassidic settlement, three miles from Tel Aviv, and residents
reported seeing two people fleeing the scene, according to Israel
radio.
   In earlier arrests over the weekend, police seized six Arabs for
allegedly setting fires in the Jerusalem area and three others in
connection with forest fires in the northern Galilee region.
   Foreign Minster Shimon Peres told Israelis Monday not to ``get
hysterical'' about the fires.
   He said Arab militants are ``always looking for new means and
new places. We must develop counter measures ... for this very
injurious assault.''

   Foreign dignitaries on official visits to the

House, the president's guest quarters.
   White House officials showed off the renovated historic house on
Monday, proudly pointing to the new electrical heating, plumbing
and air conditioning systems, roof repairs, installation of fire
and safety systems and improved security.
   ``It is not too grand, but it has elegance,'' said Chief of
Protocol Selwa Roosevelt. ``It is a guest house worthy of this
great nation.''
   She said the $13 million renovation isn't quite complete and
that guests are not expected for about six weeks. The chef, for
instance, needs to a proper gas range for cooking.
   The 115-room complex consisting of four connected townhouses on
Pennsylvania Avenue across from the White House was shut down in
1982 after a malfunctioning gas valve leaked explosive natural gas.

<TEXT>
   General Nutrition Corp., the national health
food chain, has agreed to pay $600,000 to settle allegations that
it made false claims for diet supplements.
   Under terms of the agreement announced Monday by the Federal
Trade Commission, GNC agreed to the payment to be divided equally
among the American Diabetes Association, American Cancer Society
and American Heart Association.
   The agreement settles charges brought in 1984 that GNC falsely
claimed its Healthy Greens diet supplement helped reduce the risk
of cancer, and that other food supplements would promote weight
loss, help muscle growth and retard aging, according to the trade
commission.
   GNC, based in Pittsburgh, operates some 1,100 stores across the
nation selling health food products and various vitamin and mineral
supplements. It had sales of more than $300 million in 1986

<HEAD>Aspirin Packages To Carry Stronger Warning on Reye Syndrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Packages of aspirin are required to carry
stronger warning labels against giving aspirin to children and
teen-agers with chicken pox or flu because of the danger of Reye
syndrome under new federal rules.
   The Food and Drug Administration published regulations Monday
after a Public Health Service study found a significant association
between Reye syndrome and taken aspirin during chicken pox or flu.
   The new warning, a modification of one already required on
aspirin and aspirin-containing drugs, says: ``WARNING: Children and
teen-agers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu
symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare
but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.''
   For one year, aspirin and aspirin products must display an
attention-getting device, such as a flag on the label, alerting
consumers to the new and stronger Reye syndrome warning.
   Reye syndrome is fatal in 20 percent to 30 percent of cases, and
some survivors suffer permanent brain damage. Its symptoms _ severe
tiredness, belligerence and excessive vomiting _ may occur just as
a child or teen-ager appears to be recovering from flu or chicken
pox.

<HEAD>Government Bans Freed ANC Leader From Meeting With More Than 10 At
A Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has banned
African National Congress leader Govan Mbeki from being in the
company of more than 10 people at a time, his attorney said.
   Mbeki, 77, freed from a life prison term last year, is not
allowed to attend rallies or meetings, his attorney, Priscilla
Jana, said Monday.
   The congress is the main guerrilla group fighting the South
African government, whose apartheid system denies the country's 26
million blacks a voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate schools, districts and
health services.
   Mbeki already had been prohibited from addressing meetings,
giving interviews or leaving the area near the city of Port
Elizabeth, where he lives. The new order limiting the number of
people he can be with is a common measure used by the government to
punish anti-apartheid activists.
   Ms. Jana said another of her clients, United Democratic Front
co-president Albertina Sisulu, was served with similar new orders.
   Mrs. Sisulu, wife of imprisoned ANC official Walter Sisulu, was
one of 18 black activists whose movements and speech had already
been restricted in February.
   The front, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups, was banned in
February from all activity along with 17 other anti-apartheid
organizations.
   Mrs. Jana said Mbeki filed a court challenge to the first
restrictions placed on him but will have to refile the appeal under
the new regulations.
   Mbeki was freed last August after serving 23 years for a 1964
conviction on charges of sabotage.

   Japan will double its foreign development aid to
about $50 billion in the next five years, surpassing the United
States as the world's biggest donor of such aid, the Foreign
Ministry announced today.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the new five-year program,
approved at a Cabinet session today, will more than double the $25
billion Japan gave in the past five years.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will explain the aid plan at the
Toronto summit of seven major industrial countries June 19-21, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The aid, called Official Development Assistance, totaled $7.45
billion in 1987, up 32.3 percent in dollar terms from the previous
year and 13.5 percent higher on a yen basis, the official said.
   According to latest U.S. figures, the United States gave $9.56
billion in 1986 as foreign aid.

<TEXT>
   Four Bolshevik leaders who were purged, convicted
and died during Stalin's terror of the 1930s have been exonerated
in the Kremlin's latest revision of Soviet history.
   The Soviet Supreme Court's ruling is a signal that open debate
will be allowed on reform proposals at a special Communist Party
conference this month.
   The court reversed the convictions of Lev Kamenev, Gregory
Zinoviev and Karl Radek and the lesser-known Gregory Pyatikov, the
government newspaper Izvestia reported Monday. The move restores
``to these tragic figures their honor and their names,'' the paper
said.
   The ruling does not mean complete rehabilitation unless their
Communist Party membership is restored.
   The decision had been expected since February, when the court
reversed the death sentence of Nikolai I. Bukharin, another old
Bolshevik killed in the purges. Kamenev and Zinoviev were as
important as Bukharin.
   Izvestia said the court ``did not evaluate whether they were
right or wrong in the old debates. But it said clearly: They are
innocent before the law, state, and people.''
   The article directed extraordinarily harsh criticism at Josef
Stalin, who killed many former comrades during the terror he used
to shape the Soviet economy and society while he ruled the Soviet
Union from 1927 to 1953.
   Since assuming power March 15, 1985, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
been dismantling much of the Stalinist governing structure.
Monday's court decision was another step in that process.
   At the party conference, scheduled to start June 28, delegates
will debate proposals to widen the scope of Gorbachev's
``perestroika,'' a reform program that some midlevel party and
government officials are resisting.
   Clearing Bukharin was essential because he broke with Stalin's
policy of rapid industrialization in the 1930s and advocated
policies similar to those Gorbachev is pursuing.
   Zinoviev and Kamenev are not identified as closely as Bukharin
with specific policies, but Izvestia made clear that exonerating
them was intended to foster debate.
   ``We are learning democracy, mastering the rules of political
discussions, also in a time of hard struggle,'' it said in a long
article under the headline ``A Return to Truth.''
   Zinoviev and Kamenev spent years in exile with Vladimir I.
Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, and returned to Russia with him in
February 1917. They opposed Lenin's decision in October of that
year to begin the Bolshevik Revolution, but were forgiven and named
to party posts.
   When Lenin died in 1924, Zinoviev and Kamenev sided with Stalin
against Leon Trotsky, who was driven into exile and murdered in
Mexico City in 1940. Trotsky has not been rehabilitated, but
several recent articles have dealt with his role in the revolution.
   After Trotsky was exiled, Stalin turned on his former allies.
Zinoviev and Kamenev were convicted of treason and executed after a
show trial in 1936.
   Radek, born in Poland, took part in the 1917 revolution but was
accused of siding with Trotsky and expelled from the party in 1927.
   He was rehabilitated and edited Izvestia in the 1930s, but was
tried again in 1937 and sent to a labor camp, where he is believed
to have died in about 1940.
   Pyatikov led the left wing of the Ukrainian Communist Party in
1917 and later held government posts. He was sentenced along with
Radek and executed.
   ``Our predecessors, the people of the 20s, could not control the
situation ... and were burned up in the flames of repression,''
Izvestia's legal correspondent, Yuri Feofanov, wrote in a detailed
account of the purges.
   ``They preached intolerance toward the opinions of their
opponents and gave birth to physical and moral terror,'' he wrote.
   ``In a word, discussion has been cut off for a long time about
the paths toward the building of socialism. It has been restored
now, more than a half century later, and from the same place; about
the paths of developing revolution, about the role of the party and
about the place of `the Vozhd.'''
   Stalin was known as the ``Vozhd'' _ supreme leader.

   The government of Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand and all of France wrestled with a political identity
crisis after legislative elections raised more questions than they
answered.
   Mitterrand called the elections hoping for a Socialist majority
in the 577-seat National Assembly. Polls initially predicted he
would succeed.
   But he didn't, although the opposing center-right alliance lost
the majority it won in 1986. France was bereft of a governing
majority for the first time in 30 years.
   ``The country is exhausted from having voted too much,'' the
influential Le Monde newspaper declared Monday. ``It has had enough
of politicians' games. It is up to the president, everybody says it
and everybody is right, to act.''
   Yet the president likely will find action difficult.
   Sunday's election was a defeat for Mitterrand, who won his
second seven-year term as president May 8 with 54 percent of the
vote.
   Mitterrand has in recent times largely abandoned Socialist
principles and talked of an opening to the center. On Sunday, many
French voters balked at his party's candidates.
   Mitterrand was making no announcements about his strategy after
Sunday's elections. But it was clear he could end up with a bruised
political ego in courting balky centrists or Communists.
   ``There is only one conclusion to draw from these failures,''
said Le Monde: ``All arrogance henceforth is forbidden to those who
govern us or hope to do so. Nobody can pretend to incarnate the
will of the people.''
   The Socialists tried to act like victors.
   Lionel Jospin, the Socialist education minister, said: ``One
thing is sure: the right cannot govern.'' All the rightist votes
together would not make a majority, which Jospin said ``can only be
built around the Socialist Party,'' the largest single group in the
National Assembly.
   But Socialists will need help from either the reluctant far left
or center.
   The most logical approach for Mitterrand and his premier, Michel
Rocard, would be a coalition with the Communists, whose 27 seats
would make a total of 304 for the left.
   Second on the list of possibilities is an attempt to entice at
least 13 centrist deputies from the rightist camp.
   Or Rocard could attempt a minority government at least until
autumn, trying to find a majority for each issue.
   Socialist and Communist leaders have made deals and alliances in
the past, but this time Communist Party chief Georges Marchais is
saying no. Mitterrand cannot make deals with the center-right and
the Communists at the same time, Marchais has declared, and his
party will judge the government on an issue-by-issue basis.
   Jean-Claude Gaudin, leader of the Union for French Democracy in
the outgoing assembly, said of the second possibility: ``If they
persist today in wanting to detach a few centrist personalities in
order to turn them into Socialists, I trust my elected centrist
friends to reject this proposition, which would be unworthy of
them.''
   Other centrists are more open to the idea of helping the
Socialists.
   Bernard Stasi, another centrist, said: ``If a very large union
is going to be constituted, which seems desirable to me, the center
must be the pivot.''
   Except for two seats from French Polynesia to be decided June
26, final results gave the Socialists 276 seats and Communists 27.
The center-right Union for French Democracy had 129, the
conservative Rally for the Republic 126 and minor rightists 16 for
a total of 271.
   A majority requires 289.
   The Communist Party dropped eight seats. The far-right National
Front got one seat instead of the previous 35, and it did not go to
party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen.

   Here are brief profiles of four Bolsheviks who
died in the Stalin purges of the 1930s and were cleared Monday by
the Soviet Supreme Court:
   GREGORY Y. ZINOVIEV _ Joined the Bolsheviks in 1903 and spent
more than a decade in exile before returning with Lenin in 1917. He
opposed Lenin on several issues during and after the revolution but
was a full Politburo member and head of the Communist International
until 1926. Stalin defeated Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Leon Trotsky
for supreme power. In 1935 Zinoviev was convicted of complicity in
the murder of Leningrad party chief Sergei Kirov and sentenced to
10 years in prison.The next year he was tried again and executed.
   LEV B. KAMENEV _ With Zinoviev, he opposed on tactical grounds
the decision by Lenin to seize power in the Bolshevik Revolution.
He remained a prominent party member, first joining with Zinoviev
and Stalin against Trotsky and then uniting with Zinoviev and
Trotsky against Stalin. He was expelled from the party several
times and sentenced to five years in prison in 1935. He was retried
in 1936 and executed.
   KARL B. RADEK _ Born in Poland, he joined Lenin's Bolsheviks in
the early days. He fought in the Russian revolution and tried to
organize a revolution in Germany. Radek was expelled from the
Communist Party in 1927 on charges of having supported Trotsky. He
was rehabilitated and allowed to help draft the 1936 constitution
and edit the government newspaper Izvestia. He was convicted of
treason in 1937 and is believed to have died in prison about 1940.
   GREGORY L. PYATAKOV _ A leader of the Ukrainian Communist Party,
Pyatakov set up a government in the Russian city of Kursk under
orders from Moscow and invaded the Ukraine with Red Army soldiers.
He was tried with Radek as a supporter of Trotsky in 1937 and was
executed.

   A man who romanced a gas station cashier,
robbed her and fatally bludgeoned her died early Tuesday in
Louisiana's electric chair. It was the 100th U.S. execution since
capital punishment was reinstituted.
   Lawyers for Edward R. Byrne Jr., 28, used up all their options
Monday when Louisiana's Pardon Board refused to recommend a
commutation of the death sentence and then the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to delay the execution.
   Other state and federal courts refused earlier Monday to stop
the third execution in Louisiana this year and the state's 18th
since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume
use of the death penalty.
   Byrne was executed at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for his
admitted August 1984 hammer slaying of Roberta Johnson, who was 25
at the time. A coroner pronounced him dead at 12:12 a.m., said Jim
Morris, deputy state corrections secretary.
   When he arrived in the death chamber, Byrne showed no emotion.
Asked if he had any final words, Byrne smiled slightly, shook his
head and replied, ``Nope.''
   After being strapped into the electric chair and masked, Byrne
drummed his fingers while awaiting the first of a series of surges
of electricity.
   Six pro-capital punishment demonstrators stood outside the
prison. One carried a sign that read: ``Thanks, Sam Jones,''
alluding to the pseudonym used to protect the anonymity of the
penitentiary's executioner.
   The sign-carrier identified himself as Johnny Reece of Pineville
and said he felt deprived because his daughter's killer was
sentenced to life imprisonment.
   ``It gives us a sense of justice to see this done to him
(Byrne),'' Reece said. ``It doesn't make me happy to see someone
die, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction to see justice
served.''
   Byrne was calm as he ate his final meal at the Louisiana State
Penitentiary Monday night after spending much of the day alone with
his lawyers, Warden Hilton Butler said. No relatives visited Byrne
and he asked for no spritual adviser, though prison chaplains would
have been available if Byrne had changed his mind, said Butler.
   At Monday's Pardon Board hearing, Byrne was described by defense
attorneys Amanda Potterfield and Nancy Baumgartner as a sensitive,
articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to
loved ones.
   Four of the five pardon board members who heard Byrne's case
voted against a lighter sentence. A fifth member was absent. The
Pardon Board has no power to stop executions, but can recommend
sentence reductions for approval by Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   Byrne admitted he started dating Johnson because he knew she
handled large sums of money at the service station where she
worked. But he insisted he never meant to kill her.
   Johnson died after being struck repeatedly with a ball peen
hammer.
   ``I just attempted to knock her unconscious,'' Byrne told the
Pardon Board. ``It didn't work.''
   Byrne's application to the Supreme Court for a stay was denied
with the standard dissent by Justices William J. Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall, who dissent to all executions, said court
spokeswoman Toni House. Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul
Stevens indicated they also would have granted the stay, Ms. House
said, but noted that it takes five justices to grant such a stay.
   A second application also was denied with dissents by Brennan
and Marshall, with Stevens indicating he also would have granted
the stay, she said.
   At the Pardon Board hearing, which took place at the prison,
defense lawyers had Yousef Danesh, a Southern University professor
of political science, read poetry by Byrne.
   Baumgartner said Byrne was a young man deeply remorseful about
the death he had unintentionally caused.
   Henry Brown, painted Byrne as a manipulative rogue and cold,
calculating killer. Brown said Byrne had been caught in a Leesville
hotel room the morning after the killing with a barmaid he had
picked up at a nearby tavern and had proposed marriage to.
   Parked outside was a car Byrne had stolen from the woman he
lived with before getting involved with Johnson, the prosecutor
said.

   Canadian residents were advised by their embassy
to wear pins or flags with their nation's emblem during last week's
scare over a potential terrorist attack against U.S. citizens.
   The embassy, in notices sent out Friday to the approximately 150
Canadians in the Chinese capital, also recommended that hotels and
other places frequented by North Americans be avoided, Embassy
First Secretary E.C. Wilson said.
   The notice said Canadians should try to identify themselves
through flags or pins because it is difficult for terrorists to
distinguish between Americans and Canadians, Wilson said.
   It also provided tips on security, ``but the basic message was
that this is not a serious threat to Canadians.''
   The U.S. Embassy issued a warning Thursday to the more than
1,500 Americans in Beijing, saying the Chinese government had
information that unidentified third-country terrorists might attack
Americans.
   The warning, unprecedented in the Chinese capital, was canceled
Sunday after the Chinese government gave assurances the danger was
over.
   The Chinese did not provide details of the terrorist threat _ or
explain why the danger had passed _ but said there was Middle East
involvement.

<HEAD>North Dakotans To Vote On Lottery; Virginians Pick A Congressman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   North Dakotans today got the second chance in two years to vote
on a lottery, while voters in Virginia's 5th District will fill the
seat vacated when Rep. Dan Daniels, a conservative Democrat, died
during his 10th term.
   In Maine, Linda Bean-Jones, an heiress to the L.L. Bean outdoor
wear fortune, faced Edward S. O'Meara ina 1st District Republican
primary for Congress. The winner will face Democratic Rep. Joseph
Brennan, a former two-term governor now in his first term in the
U.S. House.
   South Carolina also has congressional primaries today. In the
6th District, Democratic Rep. Robin Tallon faces a challenge from
Luther Lighty.
   The North Dakota lottery is opposed by former Gov. Arthur Link,
who says it constitutes a regressive tax on poorer citizens, and by
charities that are allowed to run casino gambling and fear the
competition.
   The measure failed two years ago, but backers predicte success
this time, helped by increased public awareness of flourishing
lotteries in neighboring South Dakota and Montana.
   Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia operate
lotteries. Wisconsin and Virginia are scheduled to start them this
summer. Voters in neighboring Minnesota are to decide in November
whether to allow one. North Dakota is the only state that has voted
down a state-run lottery.
   In Danville, Va., Vice President George Bush appeared at a rally
and barbecue Sunday on behalf of Republican Linda Arey, who faces
Democrat L.F. Payne Jr. in the special congressional election.
   Mrs. Arey, a former Reagan administration official in the
Education, Justice and Transportation departments, said she hoped
the visit would show voters she has the connections to get things
done in Washington.
   Payne developed Virginia's Wintergreen resort and ski area.
   The Maine primary heated up last week when Bean-Jones was quoted
in the Kennebec Journal in Augusta as calling the minimum wage an
``oppressive'' law that keeps people from working and saying she
would vote to abolish the $3.35 standard. O'Meara labeled her
position ``incredible'' and ``an affront'' to workers who rely on
the minimum to make ends meet.
   Bean-Jones later issued a statement saying she thought she had
been asked about a pending bill to increase the minimum wage, but
her statement did not disclaim her comments in the story.
   The latest campaign spending reports show that Bean-Jones had
raised nearly $377,000 _ nearly $280,000 in self-secured loans _
through May 25. O'Meara's total was $52,000.

<HEAD>Ozal and Papandreou Disagree Over Divided Cyprus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK QUINN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The premiers of Greece and Turkey
failed to agree over how to end their 14-year division of Cyprus
despite improved relations between the two NATO members.
   ``In the general climate of detente ... it would be strange if
Cyprus remained an example of an unsettled and dangerous
irregularity,'' Premier Andreas Papandreou said at a dinner Monday
at a tightly guarded seaside hotel outside Athens.
   Visiting Premier Turgut Ozal indicated he will not give in to
Greek pressure for troop withdrawals from northern Cyprus and said
there ``is no room for petty designs, one-sided gains and
shortsighted tactics.''
   In central Athens, about 2,000 Greek Cypriot, Armenian and
Kurdish demonstrators shouted, ``Fire for the Turkish dogs!'' and
burned Turkish flags and an effigy of Ozal outside the Turkish
Embassy.
   The fires capped a day of anti-Ozal protests that began when 60
Greek Cypriot women, some relatives of people missing since the
1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, blocked the two gateways to the
Acropolis temples.
   More protests were set for today, the second day of Ozal's
three-day visit, when the Turkish premier planned to lay a wreath
at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior outside Parliament.
   Papandreou, speaking at the poolside dinner, also said Greece
could not ignore the Cyprus problem for ``legal, moral and national
reasons.''
   The Socialist premier reiterated an earlier proposal for the
demilitarization of the eastern Mediterranean island and setting up
a mixed Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot police force.
   Last week, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar also
called for Turkey to make a gesture by reducing its estimated
29,000-strong force in the island's northern sector.
   Cyprus has been divided into separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot sectors since 1974, when the military junta then in power
in Athens backed a coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
   The action triggered a Turkish invasion, and the United Nations
has since policed the Green Line that divides the island.
   A total of 1,619 Greeks and Greek Cypriots still are missing
since the invasion, and Turkey has not accounted for their fate.
   Ozal is the first Turkish premier to visit Greece in 36 years.
In 1952, Premier Adnan Menderes received a warm welcome in Athens
at a time of Greek-Turkish detente.
   The atmosphere is sharply different this time, with 5,000 Greek
police detailed to protect the Turkish premier. He will be confined
mostly to one wing of the Vouliagmeni hotel complex.
   Papandreou also is staying in the state-owned hotel on a
peninsula jutting into the Saronic Gulf, where he spends much of
his time in the summer.
   During the meetings, two Greek Navy patrol boats cruise in the
gulf and frogmen in rubber boats ride close to the shore.
   The only sign that the Turkish premier is visiting is a
red-and-white Turkish flag flying opposite a blue-and-white Greek
flag at the hotel's front gate.
   Ozal's visit is the latest move to improve relations after a
Greek-Turkish summit at the Swiss ski resort of Davos in January.
   Fifteen months ago Greece and Turkey nearly went to war over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean Sea, which apparently persuaded
Papandreou to change his hard-line policy toward Turkey.

<HEAD>Berlin Says It Wants to Keep Karajan as Conductor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials who investigated complaints Herbert
von Karajan improperly called off too many Berlin Philharmonic
orchestra concerts decided that, despite the criticism, they need
the legendary conductor.
   West Berlin cultural affairs chief Volker Hassemer said Monday
that the West Berlin Senate voted to support the 80-year-old
Karajan's continued work with the orchestra.
   ``Karajan's name is important for the Philharmonic,'' said
Hassemer, who has himself criticized the conductor for frequent
cancellations of domestic concerts.
   A Senate committee had been reviewing its contract with Karajan,
the orchestra's conductor for life, after he called off an
appearance in Berlin in April because of illness and then flew to
Japan for a 10-day tour with the orchestra the next day.
   Karajan has suffered serious medical problems in recent years,
including severe back pains that have forced him to cancel
conducting appearances.
   But critics said several concerts were canceled under
questionable circumstances.
   Philharmonic fans also complained in angry letters to newspapers
about Karajan's infrequent appearances in Berlin.
   In November, Karajan announced he could not mount the podium in
Duesseldorf because he had food poisoning from tainted fish. He
later changed his mind and performed but called off his appearance
in Stuttgart during the same tour.
   Karajan's Berlin contract calls for him to conduct about a dozen
concerts a year.
   Hassemer said the Senate would make sure the contract was
fulfilled in the future. He did not elaborate.

Debated</HEAD>

   A landmark jury verdict gives a smoker's
widower $400,000 in damages, the first time a tobacco company has
been ordered to pay money for disease caused by cigarettes.
   But the three tobacco companies sued called the verdict a
victory and the jury's award a vote of sympathy for the bereaved
husband of Rose Cipollone, who died of lung cancer after smoking 1{
packs a day for 40 years.
   The U.S. District Court jury Monday exonerated the cigarette
makers Liggett Group Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. of
conspiring to mislead the public about smoking's dangers, and
rejected punitive damages.
   Instead, it decided Liggett failed to warn about the dangers of
cigarettes and violated its promise, or ``express warranty,'' to
produce a safe product.
   It awarded Antonio Cipollone damages on the warranty claim but
not for the failure to warn the public because it found his wife
was 80 percent responsible for contracting the disease that killed
her in 1984 at age 58.
   Liggett faced additional charges because it manufactured the
Chesterfields and L&Ms that Mrs. Cipollone smoked before 1966, when
Congress ordered health warnings on cigarette packs. Mrs. Cipollone
later used brands by Lorillard and Philip Morris, smoking even
after having part of her lung removed in 1981.
   Liggett attorneys promised an appeal. Cipollone's lawyers said
they would ask the judge to overturn the decision not to award
posthumous damages to Mrs. Cipollone.
   The $35 billion tobacco industry mounted an elaborate defense _
one analyst put the cost at $50 million _ to avoid a judgment that
might unleash a flood of multimillion-dollar lawsuits. Reaction to
the verdict, which followed five days of deliberations, focused on
its potential impact on hundreds of such cases pending around the
nation.
   Cipollone's attorneys said the decision showed the tobacco
industry is not invincible.
   ``Any time a jury awards a $400,000 verdict, I don't think you
can take it too lightly, particularly in a situation where five
years ago people thought we were crazy and when for the past 30
years people have failed,'' said Marc Z. Edell, Cipollone's lawyer.
   Fewer than a dozen of about 300 smoker lawsuits have gone to
juries and the tobacco industry has not paid a dollar in damages.
Most of the other cases withered in the face of the well-heeled
tobacco industry's legal forces.
   ``All I know is that we're not another notch in their gun,''
said Edell.
   But some said the damages awarded might not be enough to
encourage other lawsuits.
   ``Are you going to sue if all you're going to get is $400,000?''
asked tobacco industry analyst Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch in New
York.
   Financial markets were closed when the verdict came in but
Kaplan predicted no long-term negative impact on tobacco stocks.
   ``Plaintiff attorneys cannot be encouraged by the small size of
the award, which pales in comparison to the $3 million they spent
in time and money to try this case,'' said a joint statement from
Peter Bleakley of Philip Morris and Robert Northrip of Lorillard,
both New York based.
   ``The fact that the jury awarded no damages to Mrs. Cipollone
was a clear signal from the jury that smoking is a matter of
personal choice and responsibility,'' said Alan Hilburg, spokesman
for Durham, N.C.-based Liggett.
   Liggett attorney Donald Cohn said he regarded the award as
``sympathy'' for Cipollone, a 64-year-old retired cable splicer
from Lakehurst who pursued the lawsuit he had filed with his wife
in 1983.
   ``I believe that it is a victory for her,'' Cipollone said. ``It
wasn't 100 percent. I'm glad that we won partial, but it's a
start.''
   The jurors in the four-month trial would not discuss the verdict
other than to say the process was ``emotional'' and ``nerve
wracking.''
   Anti-smoking groups viewed the verdict as a first step.
   It ``destroys the myth of invulnerability'' and should lead to
an increase in such lawsuits, said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern
University law professor who runs the Tobacco Products Liability
Project, a support group for litigation against tobacco companies.
   ``What it's going to do is encourage hundreds of smokers and
their families to seek redress. It has finally convinced lots of
smokers that the evidence is clear,'' he said.
   To support the contention that Liggett violated its promise to
consumers of a safe product, Edell introduced advertisements for
Liggett's cigarettes from the 1950s.
   One featured actress Rosalind Russell with the text reading:
``Rosalind Russell says L&M Filters are Just What the Doctor
Ordered!'' Others said: ``Nose, Throat and Accessory Organs Not
Adversely Affected By Smoking Chesterfields,'' and ``Play Safe,
Smoke Chesterfields.''
   Cipollone's attorneys also introduced numerous secret corporate
documents they said chronicled the inner workings of the industry.
For many anti-smoking forces, disclosure of these documents into
evidence was a victory.
   The documents spoke of a ``gentleman's agreement'' not to do
cancer research, of an industry ``strategy'' to create ``doubt
about the health charge without actually denying it'' and of a
research program designed ``so that (the) results cannot harm'' the
industry.
   The companies denied the statements in the documents, saying
they represented the views of individuals and were taken out of
context.
   They contended that Mrs. Cipollone knew the risks but chose to
smoke anyway. They also argued that smoking is not a proven cause
of cancer, and that her type of cancer hasn't been linked to
cigarettes.
   The defense managed to block many of Cipollone's claims,
including contentions that cigarette companies could be blamed for
illnesses in smokers unaware of the dangers after the 1966
warnings, that the risk of cigarettes outweighed their usefulness
and that the companies knew or should have known of a safer way to
make cigarettes.

<HEAD>Contractor Mailing Concrete Blocks 700 Miles Via Postal Loophole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Anchorage building-materials
supplier is taking advantage of a loophole in postal regulations to
mail 6,000 concrete blocks to a remote village 700 miles away.
   The shipments across Alaska could end up costing the U.S. Postal
Service $500,000, and even the air carrier that stands to profit
thinks the mail system is being abused.
   Sam Krogstad of Bush Consolidators, which specializes in sending
construction materials via the mail, says the Postal Service's
losses are partly self-inflicted because the postal system pays 10
times as much to send the building materials by air freight as it
charges Krogstad to mail them.
   Each individually addressed concrete block costs Krogstad $4.33
in postage. The same block costs the post office $50.94 to deliver
to Wainwright, an Arctic Ocean Eskimo community about 90 miles
southwest of Barrow. That's a subsidy of $46.61 per block.
   Krogstad also is mailing 4,600 bags of cement to Wainwright.
   The blocks each weigh 67 pounds and the bags of cement about 65
pounds, so they fall just under the parcel-post limit of 70 pounds
to qualify as mail. His postage costs will total about $45,000.
   The blocks and bags could have been shipped via air freight from
Anchorage for a little more than $210,000, but the way mail is
handled in rural Alaska more than doubles the cost.
   First, the Postal Service trucks the blocks to Fairbanks, about
360 miles. They are then flown to Barrow on large cargo planes,
transferred to small planes and flown to Wainwright in loads of 18
to 35 blocks.
   The practice is called ``bypass'' mail because the shipment
moves directly from sender to airline to addressee, bypassing post
offices.
   ``This was not the intent of the bypass program,'' says Tim
Dorgan, a Postal Service transportation supervisor. ``The original
intent of bypass mail was to clear the postal floor of large
shipments of groceries and staples required for day-to-day living.''
   But Krogstad says the system means his shipments cost the Postal
Service 76 cents a pound from Fairbanks to Wainwright instead of
the 30 cents a pound that a charter flight from Anchorage to
Wainwright would cost.
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Krogstad said. ``It's un-American, it's got
to be unconstitutional, that a branch of the U.S. government can't
go out and competitively bid to get the best price on hauling the
mail.''
   Even one of the prime beneficiaries of the block-lift has
misgivings.
   ``We're philosophically opposed to it,'' says Don Brugman,
president of Northern Air Cargo, which is hauling many of the
blocks and cement bags. ``It's not what the mail is for.''
   Dorgan says he's worried the block-lift may put an end to bypass
mail once word gets around. ``The people in the bush are the ones
who are going to suffer,'' he said.
   Another problem, says Dorgan, is that the block-lift may cause a
backup of ordinary mail, such as groceries, bound for villages
served from Barrow.
   The idea of mailing the materials ``was an angle that got us the
job,'' said Bob Gilman, owner of Gilco Construction, a contractor
building a small-boat harbor at Wainwright with the blocks.
   He says he feels bad, but ``it is just an angle and that's the
nature of the business we're in.''

   Vice President George Bush has filled two

secretary.
   Bush, who has not had a campaign spokesman since longtime aide
Peter Teeley resigned last Month in a clash with other Bush
associates, said at a press conference on Monday, that ``these two
professionals will strengthen my campaign organization.''
   Lake, a Washington-based political consultant, served a similar
role in the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign and was press secretary to
President Reagan early in his 1980 campaign.
   Ms. Tate, a former press secretary to Nancy Reagan, had been
managing director of the Washington office of Hill and Knowlton, a

   Bush also named Stephen Hart, who has been acting press

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Former presidential candidate Bruce Babbitt
said Democratic presidential nominee-apparent Michael Dukakis
should nominate a ``generic Southerner'' as his running mate.
   Speaking with reporters on Monday, Babbitt said he
``absolutely'' planned to campaign on behalf of the Massachusetts
governor this fall, hoping to press specifically for environmental
issues.
   He offered some unsolicited advice to the Democratic
presidential nominee-to-be, saying Dukakis should pick a southern
running mate. He kiddingly placed himself in that column.
   ``Which Southerner? Well, I once said to him, I'm from southern
Arizona,'' Babbitt joked.
   ``But my advice is what I think is in the interest of the
ticket. It compels, I think, a real undeniably generic Southerner.''
   Did he have anyone in particular in mind to fill the post?
   ``Yeah, lots,'' said Babbitt, who proceeded to reel off a list
of possibilities that included Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee,
presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson, Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas,
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alas! 'Tis poetic justice, wrote the jurist,
perhaps disturbing your legal purists.
   In a ruling that started with a poem, U.S. District Judge H. Lee
Sarokin upheld a bankruptcy judge's decision that Kevin A.
Rowland's filing for bankruptcy was no protection from an $8,500
award won against him by Sean Coughlin.
   Coughlin, 27, won the award in his lawsuit against Rowland, who
punched out his front teeth during a teen-age fracas in Bergenfield
in 1979, according to Sarokin's opinion.
   In his ruling Monday, Sarokin wrote:
   ``On this appeal the facts are undisputed; Mr. Rowland's punch
caused Mr. Coughlin's teeth to be uprooted,''
   ``Coughlin sued in the state court and won.
   ``Rowland filed in bankruptcy to get the debt undone.
   ``The bankruptcy court found the assault to be a willful and
malicious blow,
   ``And the request to discharge the debt was answered `no.'
   ``The bankruptcy court correctly decided that the debtor
intended harm,
   ``By propelling his fist into plaintiff's mouth with his arm.
   ``This court agrees that bankruptcy law should not be enlarged,
   ``So as to permit a judgment for assault and battery to be
discharged.
   ``To do so would require existing precedent to be spurned.
   ``For these reasons the decision of the bankruptcy court will be
affirmed.''

   Here are the key players in the cigarette
liability case filed by Rose and Antonio Cipollone against three
tobacco companies in U.S. District Court:
   _ Antonio Cipollone, 64, recently moved to a Lakehurst
retirement community after more than 20 years in Little Ferry. He
emigrated from Italy at age 15 and worked in construction, then as
a cable-splicer. He attended every day of the four-month trial. He
said his wife's painful illness and death was ``devastating,'' and
continued with the case because she wanted him to.
   _ Rose Cipollone started smoking at age 16, contracted lung
cancer in 1981 and died four years ago at age 58. Mrs. Cipollone
was raised in East Harlem in New York, and moved to New Jersey in
1960. ``I was sure that if there was anything that dangerous, that
the tobacco people wouldn't allow it and the government wouldn't
let them'' sell cigarettes, she said before her death.
   _ Marc Z. Edell, 36, acted as the lead attorney for Cipollone. A
graduate of New York University Law School, he works for the
Millburn Township firm of Budd, Larner, Gross, Picillo, Rosenbaum,
Greenberg & Sade, which defended the Manville Co. in asbestos
litigation. Edell, at a previous firm, defended another asbestos
company. Edell, in explaining why his client was seeking damages in
the case, said in his summation that, ``This is not acceptable
behavior by any industry.''
   _ Donald J. Cohn, 58, senior attorney for tobacco companies and
specifically represented Liggett. A graduate of Yale Law School,
Cohn is a member of the New York firm Webster & Sheffield and has
represented Liggett in tobacco suits for 23 years. A former
assistant U.S. attorney in New York and a fellow of the American
College of Trial Lawyers.
   _ Philip Morris Inc. of New York is the leading U.S. cigarette
manufacturer with 37.9 percent of $22 billion market and makes
Marlboro, the nation's top-selling brand. Its parent corporation
also owns General Foods Corp. and Miller Brewing Co. The
conglomerate reported net earnings of $1.84 billion on operating
revenues of $27.7 billion in 1987. It employs 90,000 in United
States.
   _ Lorillard Inc. of New York has 8.2 percent of domestic
cigarette market with a net income of $246.9 million on sales of
$1.68 billion. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Loews Corp.,
which also owns CNA Insurance, Bulova Watch Co. and one quarter of
CBS Inc. Lorillard is the nation's oldest tobacco company. Founded
in 1760 by Frenchman Pierre Lorillard. Makes Newport, Kent and
True. It has 4,650 employees.
   _ Liggett Group Inc. of Durham, N.C., has 3.6 percent of the
cigarette market. It has a net income of $30.7 million on sales of
$531.9 million and is the nation's sixth largest cigarette maker
and manufactures L&M, Chesterfield, Lark and Eve. It employs 1,800.
   _ U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin, 59, was born in Perth
Amboy to a newspaper publisher, was raised in Maplewood and was
appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979. He
acted as campaign finance chairman for Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
in 1980. Among his cases, Sarokin freed former boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, who was jailed on triple murder charges,
citing racial bias in Carter's conviction. Sarokin is known for
outspoken opinions and ruled mid-way through the cigarette case
that the jury had enough evidence to find a tobacco industry
conspiracy ``vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and
devastating in its results.''

   A landmark welfare bill aimed at using
education, jobs and training to help people break out of poverty is
undergoing final adjustments as senators try to avert a
presidential veto of the $2.6 billion, five-year measure.
   The Family Security Act sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., reached the Senate floor Monday after 18 months
in the making. The painstaking groundwork produced a bipartisan
bill co-sponsored by nearly two-thirds of the Senate.
   ``This bill is not far off from what I find most people want,''
said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., Republican floor manager of the
measure. ``This is as good an effort as we're likely to get out of
this Congress.''
   A more expensive House measure passed Dec. 17.
   Under the Moynihan bill, states would be required to set up
education, training and work programs and include as many
participants as they could afford.
   Besides putting more welfare recipients to work, the bill would
force more absentee parents to pay child support and require states
to provide at least six months of annual welfare benefits to poor
households with two parents.
   Government checks would be a last resort, an income supplement
reserved for when parents could not contribute an adequate amount
in child support or earned wages. The bill would reverse the
current system, under which the check is the central and usually
only element.
   ``Never has the Senate considered so fundamental a redirection
of the (welfare) system,'' Moynihan said.
   Key senators and their staffs started meeting Monday with
administration aides to discuss White House demands for several new
provisions. A presidential veto was threatened if administration
demands were not met.
   The administration wants the bill to give states broader
authority to use federal money for experimental welfare schemes; to
require that a certain percentage of welfare recipients participate
in jobs programs; and to set up a new mandatory workfare program
that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said could cost as
much as $900 million.
   Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the current welfare
system, was begun in 1935 to help widows with children to raise.
The joint federal-state program now serves 3.7 families, including
7 million children, and the recipients are no longer widows _ they
are for the most part single or divorced mothers.
   The nation is ``trying to make do with a Rube Goldberg welfare
system developed during the Depression to meet the needs of a
society that no longer exists,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ``Let's not lose this
opportunity to move our country forward.''
   Among the provisions in the Moynihan bill:
   _States would have to require parents to furnish Social Security
numbers at the birth of their children; meet minimum standards for
establishing paternity; set guidelines for child support awards;
and set procedures for immediate wage withholding from paychecks.
   _States would have to establish a jobs, education and training
program for welfare recipients with children age 3 or over, or age
1 at state option; guarantee child care for participants, and spend
half their money on people who are long-term welfare recipients or
are likely to be.
   _States would have to provide nine months of transitional child
care assistance and a year of Medicaid coverage for people moving
off welfare into the workforce.
   _States would have to give welfare benefits to families with two
parents in the home. Twenty-six states already provide such
benefits; Moynihan's compromise would make six months a year
mandatory in the other 24 states.
   _The federal share of the new expenses, $2.6 billion over five
years, would be financed primarily by making permanent the tax
refund withholding program for delinquent federal debtors and
phasing out the dependent care tax credit for higher-income
taxpayers.

<TEXT>
   A regional official accused a
Japanese television crew of insulting natives of a remote jungle
area of Borneo Island by having them act like headhunters and crawl
and howl like dogs.
   The national news agency Bernama said today that the reported
incident in Sabah state angered Muruts, the indigenous population,
and prompted a government investigation.
   Kadoh Agundong, Sabah state's culture, youth and sports
minister, strongly criticized the incident and said it was aimed at
degrading the Muruts, the agnecy said.
   Kadoh said the TV quiz show crew should not have asked the
Muruts to act as headhunters because they had long abandoned the
practice of headhunting. He said foreigners would be scared to
visit Sabah if the show were screened.
   Bernama quoted Johnny Tanakinjal, Tenom assistant district
officer, as saying he saw the television crew on May 27 coax a
Murut to crawl to a jar of rice wine, take a sip and howl and bark
like a dog.
   Tanakinjal said the crew ignored his protests and chased him
away.
   Tenom district is 1,090 miles east of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
   Kadoh told a news conference in Kota Kinabalu, capital of Sabah
state, that he had ordered his ministry to investigate the
incident. He said if the matter was true he would have the
government lodge an official protest with the Japanese Foreign
Ministry.
   The quiz show, called ``Naruhodo The World'' (Naruhodo meaning
indeed), is a weekly hourlong program that usually spotlights one
country. Questions are posed to contestants after short video clips
of the country are shown.

   The South African government has agreed to allow
The New York Times to reopen its bureau there after imposing a ban
on the newspaper's coverage more than a year ago.
   The government informed Times officials on Monday that it will
accept an application from a staff correspondent to report full
time in South Africa, the newspaper reported today.
   The Times had been barred from having a correspondent in South
Africa since January 1987, when the government refused to renew the
accreditation of Alan Cowell, or to accept a successor.
   The Times has been represented by John D. Battersby, a South
African journalist, since the ban. Executive Editor Max Frankel had
asked the government to allow the paper to send its own
correspondent.
   The paper has submitted the name of Christopher S. Wren as its
next bureau chief in Johannesburg. Wren, an assistant foreign
editor, has headed the paper's bureaus in Moscow, Cairo, Beijing
and Ottawa.

   Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American advocate of
non-violent resistance to Israel, arrived here after Israel defied
the United States and deported him from his birthplace of Jerusalem.
   The deportation ended a seven-month legal battle and made Awad
the 21st Arab to be expelled by Israel since the Dec. 8 start of
the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Awad, 44, did not meet waiting reporters at Kennedy
International Airport after his arrival Monday night from Israel.
But a spokesman made a brief statement on his behalf and said Awad
planned to a hold a news conference this afternoon.
   ``He wanted me to express his deep appreciation'' to U.S.
officials who protested his deportation, said Charles Kimball,
director of the Middle East office of the National Council of
Churches. He named Secretary of State George Shultz, Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Murphy, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Thomas
Pickering and counsuls general in Israel Morris Draper and Bill
Wilcox.
   ``They have worked consistently, arduously and enormously
helpfully on his behalf from the beginning of this whole process,
and he's deeply grateful,'' Kimball said, his words at times
drowned out by the chanting of anti-Awad protesters.
   The United States condemned Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's order that Awad, a U.S. citizen, be deported. Shamir
alleged that Awad played a key role in the Arab uprising in the
occupied territories.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``We think
it is unjustifiable to deny Mr. Awad the right to stay and live in
Jerusalem where he was born. If he acted illegally, he should have
been charged and tried in court with full due process of law.''
   Israel has regularly carried out deportations to quell unrest or
subdue Palestinian nationalist activity, notably expelling nine
West Bank mayors between 1980 and 1982. But the number of
deportations has greatly increased since the Arab uprising began.
   Awad, whom supporters call the ``Palestinian Gandhi,'' denied
inciting violence against Israel but has supported the uprising in
the territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Although he has little influence in the Palestinian community, some
tactics he advocates, such as tax boycotts and commercial strikes,
were adopted by leaders of the uprising.
   Awad, who was incarcerated 40 days in Israel, was kept away from
reporters in Jerusalem before he left, but his letters to
supporters from prison were distributed.
   ``Even after my departure, my efforts will continue,'' Awad
wrote. ``We have no choice but to continue with the uprising for
our liberation.''
   He vowed in the letters to return soon. Awad, a Christian, has
said he might convert to Judaism as a means to return to Israel.
   His deportation was protested by about a dozen Israelis at the
Jerusalem airport and 25 supporters in downtown Jerusalem. Dozens
of angry Israelis staged an impromptu counterdemonstration, calling
the Awad supporters traitors.
   Awad was deported on the grounds that his three-month tourist
visa, issued when he entered Israel last August, had expired. The
Israelis refused to extend the visa, and the Israeli Supreme Court
last week rejected Awad's appeal to remain.
   Some 50 demonstrators _ about evenly split for and against Awad
_ gathered at Kennedy Airport.
   New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat, led
a group of protesters who shouted ``Awad is a terrorist.''
Separated from the Hikind group by a line of police officers was a
pro-Arab group shouting ``Down, down with Israel'' and ``Long live
Mubarak.''
   Awad, who lived in the United States for 13 years before
returning to Jerusalem in 1983, is the founder of the Palestinian
Center for the Study of Non-Violence. He has lectured on civil
disobedience, counseled teachers against corporal punishment and
planted olive trees in West Bank villages to underscore the Arabs'
claim to the land.
   He lived in Wapakoneta, Ohio, where he still owns a home. His
wife, Nancy Nye, flew to New York on Sunday.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev threatened to retaliate if
Pakistan keeps supplying Afghan rebels while Moscow withdraws its
troops from Afghanistan.
   Monday's warning was the first of its kind directly from the
Soviet leader. It came in a joint statement with Afghan President
Najib.
   It followed reports from Pakistan that said Soviet forces
returned to some cities in eastern Afghanistan to fight guerrillas
who raided posts defended by Afghan troops.
   The joint Najib-Gorbachev statement distributed over the
official Tass news agency said: ``The Soviet Union and Afghanistan
believed that the U.N. Mission monitoring compliance with the
Geneva accords would adopt ... effective measures to curb the
practice (of Pakistan aiding the guerrillas) which, if continued,
would make it necessary to undertake the most resolute retaliatory
steps.''
   In recent days, the Soviets have been warning Pakistan and the
United States that continuing to arm the guerrillas violated the
accords signed in Geneva in April. Under the accords, the Kremlin
agreed to withdraw its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan by
Feb. 15, and the withdrawal began May 15.
   The Red Army intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 and has
been helping the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem rebels.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez said Monday that Soviet troops were
leaving Afghanistan ``faster than we all expected.''
   Thousands of Soviet troops have already pulled out, but Cordovez
refused to say exactly how many.
   However, Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, S. Shah Nawaz, said Monday
that ``the world will not be surprised if a crumbling (Afghan)
regime makes a desperate bid to retain the protective umbrella of
foreign troops.''

<HEAD>Jackson Says Differences Remain With Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he can rally his supporters
behind certain Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis even if he's not
Dukakis' running mate, if the two can agree on key policy issues.
   Jackson said it was premature to discuss whether he will
actively seek the vice presidential spot on the Democratic national
ticket.
   But by virtue of his performance in the primaries, ``we've
earned the right for serious consideration, and if there is a
criteria by which one qualifies for consideration we'll pass it,''
said Jackson, speaking to reporters on Monday.
   Even if his name isn't on the ticket, Jackson said he could
deliver his supporters for the Massachusetts governor, ``so long as
our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.''
   Jackson said negotiations with the Dukakis camp so far ``are
having an impact on broadening and strengthening the Democratic
Party.''
   He praised a weekend agreement with Dukakis backers to brand
South Africa a ``terrorist state'' as part of the Democratic Party
platform.
   Jackson made his remarks a day after representatives of both
Democratic Party presidential candidates held the first in a series
of platform-drafting meetings at Mackinac Island, Mich. The
representatives announced they had agreed on the South Africa issue.
   This ``is a step in the right direction for America because we
must regain our credibility and our moral authority in the third
world as leader of the free world,'' Jackson told reporters at the
impromptu sidewalk news conference.
   But Jackson said differences over other issues remain. Jackson,
for instance, is calling for a freeze on military spending, which
Dukakis hasn't supported. Jackson said a freeze would give us
``money to pay for our dreams,'' including health care, housing and
senior citizens' programs.
   Meanwhile, in an interview published today, Jackson called
Chicago the nation's most racially divided city.
   The racial tensions in Chicago are ``not representative of
what's happening in American today,'' Jackson told the Chicago
Tribune.
   ``I can't think of another city in the country right now where
you have the kind of confrontation without shame along racial lines
that you now have in our City Council-type squabbles,'' he said.
   ``That's not L.A., that's not St. Louis, that's not any other
major city I know, and it's really beneath the dignity of the
city,'' Jackson said in a meeting with the editorial board of the
Chicago Tribune.
   Jackson was in Chicago for meetings with his national staff to
discuss plans for next month's Democratic National Convention.

   Hundreds of radical students
chanting anti-American slogans demonstrated today at the edge of
the demilitarized zone for reunification of North Korea and South
Korea.
   About 1,300 students staged a sitdown protest in front of a
bridge leading to the zone that divides the Korean peninsula. The
bridge was blocked by steel barriers and rolls of barbed wire.
   ``Drive out Yankees who hinder unification'' and ``Advance
unification,'' students chanted.
   The students denounced the government of President Roh Tae-woo
and yelled slogans calling on all South Korean students to refuse
compulsory weekly military training. The training is required for
all male students.
   U.S. Army troops that normally guard the bridge were withdrawn
before the students arrived today. A few South Korean personnel
were seen guarding the bridge on the other side of the barriers.
   The students, from Korea and Joongang universities in Seoul,
went to Imjingak in a convoy of buses for a prayer ceremony for
reunification. They were accompanied by professors from the two
schools to help ensure the demonstration was peaceful.
   Imjingak, the last civilian area on the main road from Seoul, is
about three miles from the southern edge of the demilitarized zone.
   The government banned a march Friday to the border with
communist North Korean by thousands of radical students seeking
talks with North Korean student delegates on reunification.
   Fierce street clashes erupted in Seoul when riot police blocked
radicals going to the border, and about 900 students were arrested.
   Student leaders said today's demonstration, described as a
prayer ceremony for unification, was different from Friday's march
since there were no plans to enter the demilitarized zone or meet
with North Korean representatives. The South Korean government says
it alone can have contacts with the north.
   The 2{-mile-wide zone separates the two Koreas with the border
running through the center. Forces of the two sides control their
respective sides of the zone.
   U.S. troops help control the south's side of the zone across
from Imjingak and the Panmunjom truce site that straddles the
border.
   Students wanted to meet Friday at Panmunjom with North Korean
student delegates who reportedly were waiting there.
   Radical students have been demanding reunification of the Korean
peninsula, divided since 1945 when U.S. and Soviet troops ended the
Japanese occupation at the end of World War II.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government
and anti-American protests during the past month. Radical students
battled riot police to press for overthrow of the Roh government
and reunification.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority among South Korean
students, claim the United States enforces partition of the
peninsula to rule the south. Radicals demand withdrawal of the
42,000 U.S. troops based in the south under a defense treaty.
   The radicals have been unable to attract public support. Most
South Koreans fear the north is determined to conquer the
peninsula. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the
Korean War.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Says Illegal Alien Entitled To Sue For Back Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court decision that an illegal
alien can sue his employer for nearly $50,000 in unpaid wages
``blazes a trail'' for other rulings favoring immigrant workers, a
union official says.
   The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
Rajni J. Patel, an illegal alien from India, is entitled to sue for
unpaid back wages incurred during a three-year period. The decision
reverses a U.S. District Court ruling last year throwing out the
case, which hinged on the court's interpretation of the U.S. Fair
Labor Standards Act.
   The International Ladies Garment Workers Union supplied Patel
with legal help and filed a brief supporting him.
   Union spokesman John Burke said the ruling not only vindicates
Patel's claims, but ``blazes a trail which, we hope, will lead to
similar rulings on other fronts ... favorable to immigrants.''
   The appeals court cleared the way for Patel to proceed with his
lawsuit against a Birmingham, Ala., hotel, where he worked as a
maintenance man and janitor from 1982 to 1985.
   Patel in 1986 sued the Quality Inn South of Birmingham and its
owners, Sumani Corp., contending that the hotel violated wage and
overtime laws and owed him $47,132 in back pay, plus damages and
attorneys' fees.
   In March 1987, according to the appeals court opinion, U.S.
District Judge William M. Acker Jr. suggested to the hotel's
lawyers that they request a summary judgment to the effect that
Patel, as an undocumented alien, wasn't entitled to the protection
of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
   The hotel's attorneys, ``able to take a hint,'' made such a
request, the 11th Circuit noted, and the judgment was issued
against Patel in May 1987. He appealed.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court, in an opinion
released last week, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has
historically ``adopted an expansive definition of the term
`employee,''' and that Congress has clearly intended for
undocumented aliens to be protected under the fair labor law.
   Patel's case, the 11th Circuit Court said, falls under the law,
and ``nothing in the act purports to limit the remedy available to
... workers.''
   ``Patel is not attempting to recover back pay for being
unlawfully deprived of a job,'' the appeals court wrote. ``Rather,
he simply seeks to recover unpaid minimum wages and overtime for
work already performed.''

<TEXT>
   Alaskan and Soviet Eskimos holding
their first major reunion since the Cold War imposed a forced
separation 40 years ago sang and talked animatedly today about
current events _ like walrus hunting.
   The meeting at the Palace of Culture in this remote Siberian
port was one of the highlights of the 225-mile ``friendship
flight'' from the western Alaska town of Nome by an 82-member U.S.
delegation.
   Timothy Gologergen, 68, of Nome shared a traditional song with a
Siberian Eskimo who identified himself as Kaygigun, 41, from the
nearby village of New Chaplino.
   ``They got three walruses last night,'' Gologergen said later.
``They were hauling them back and forth by dog team, and he heard
that we were coming. He dropped everything and came over.
   ``He said this way is really good _ just to speak our own
(Yupik) dialect and not listen to the war stories or think about
war, or plan about war _ just be doing our thing, speaking our
Yupik language and hunting and being relaxed,'' Gologergen said.
   The Soviets earlier this month approved the charter flight by
Eskimos, Alaskan business leaders, peace activists and politicians,
the product of two years' work by Alaskans.
   Eskimos once freely crossed the icy Bering Strait in motorboats
and walrus-skin umiaks to trade and visit with relatives. The Cold
War ended all that in 1948, when the border was closed.
   Summit meetings between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev helped make the ``friendship flight'' possible,
said Bob Clarke, a State Department official on the flight.
   The summits were ``strong on people-to-people exchanges,''
Clarke said. ``This is a real grass-roots effort.''
   The leader of the effort was James Stimpfle, a 40-year-old Nome
real estate agent who dreamed up the flight two years ago to help
thaw relations between Alaska and Siberia.
   Stimpfle said he wrote hundreds of letters to U.S. and Soviet
officials, trying to win acceptance for his idea of breaking down
political barriers with good will.
   ``There's security in friendship,'' he said.
   While eastern Siberia is eight time zones away from Moscow, it's
only 3 miles from Alaska at the closest point.
   Provideniya, with about 5,000 residents, is a gray city of
concrete-block apartments surrounded by mountains. Remnants of the
winter's packed ice still clog the fringes of the harbor. Like
Nome, an old gold-rush town of 3,700, Provideniya has no roads
leading inland.
   As the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 came to a halt on the gravel
Siberian runway, schoolchildren waved Soviet and U.S. flags. Local
officials and visitors shouted greetings in Russian, English and
Yupik over the roar of jets.
   Leaders of the Alaskan delegation were handed carnations beneath
a sign proclaiming ``Peace and Friendship Between Alaska and
Chukotka!'' Provideniya is in the district of Chokotka.
   Formality soon gave way to a frenzy of hugs, handshakes and
trading of pins, flags, chewing gum and postcards.
   The reunion came too late for John Waghiyi, 64, an Eskimo born
on St. Lawrence Island, 40 miles from the Siberian coast, who came
looking for a distant relative on his father's side, but learned
the man had died years ago.
   Waghiyi remembered visiting the relative as a young man.
   ``The next year, I was going to see him at Gambell (on St.
Lawrence Island). He was going to give me a Russian coat, but they
closed the Russian border.''
   Other potential reunions were aborted when a planned trip to a
nearby native village was canceled by poor weather.
   Still, Waghiyi and others hoped the visit would clear the way
for more interchanges between Alaska and Siberia. Gologergen said
that, governments willing, the Siberian Eskimos would visit Alaska.
   ``We were like East and Western Germany before,'' said Waghiyi.
``We were like behind the Iron Curtain. Now we're going to be in
their front yard.''

   The Tokyo stock market's key indicator closed
slightly higher today, while the U.S. dollar weakened against the
Japanese yen in slow trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose by 25.26
points, or 0.09 percent, from Monday to finish at 28,061.80, the
highest closing level since Thursday's record 28,072.02 points.
   An official of Nomura Securities Co., who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the market was slack, even though the Nikkei Stock
Average rose slightly. He said investors were refraining from
taking action without fresh incentives.
   Volume of trade in the first section totaled 850 million shares,
down from Monday's 900 million shares.
   In foreign exchange dealings, the U.S. dollar closed at 125.05
yen, down 0.14 yen from Monday's close. It opened at 125.15 yen and
was traded in a range between 125.02 yen and 125.18 yen.
   An official of the Bank of Tokyo said the market was quiet in
anticipation of the release of U.S. trade figures for April in the
United States later today.
   Volume of trade totaled $2.5 billion, compared to Monday's $2.6
billion dollars and $5.5 billion on Friday.
   Traders said market participants were expecting the U.S. trade
deficit in April to rise from the March level of $11.95 billion to
$12-13 billion on an adjusted basis.

   The Soviet Union conducted an underground nuclear
test today on the steppes of Central Asia, the Tass news agency
said.
   In a two-sentence report, the agency said the blast had a yield
of 20 kilotons and was carried out ``for the purpose of upgrading
military technology.''
   The test was staged at the Semipalatinsk range in the Central
Asian republic of Kazakhstan, Tass said. It provided no further
details.
   Twenty kilotons, the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT, was the
force of the U.S. atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.
   It was the sixth Soviet nuclear test of the year.

   Teamsters President Jackie Presser has
been released from a hospital where doctors have said the
critically ill Presser has been receiving radiation treatments for
brain tumors.
   Presser was released Monday from Barrow Neurological Institute,
Kay Lyshoj, a nursing coordinator, said today. She said she had no
information on Presser's whereabouts or condition.
   Debra Gelbart, Barrow spokeswoman, said she had no information
about Presser and noted that his family had requested no
information be released.
   Presser had been at Barrow since mid-May, receiving radiation
treatment after the removal of a cancerous lesion from his brain
May 17.
   In a June 7 telephone conversation with U.S. District Judge
George White in Cleveland, Barrow Director Dr. Robert Spetzler said
Presser was being treated with radiation for one brain lesion and
may have two others.
   Another doctor, Dr. Leslie Sheeler of the Cleveland Clinic, told
White in a May 26 letter that Presser may have six months to live.
Presser underwent lung cancer surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in
January 1987,
   White on June 7 postponed indefinitely Presser's trial on
racketeering and embezzlement charges. The trial had been scheduled
to start July 12.
   Presser relinquished his duties as Teamsters president for four
months beginning in May because of his poor health.
Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis has taken over Presser's duties.

<HEAD>Former Justice Minister Dies at 69.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lucien Cardin, who precipitated a parliamentary
crisis in 1966 as justice minister in the Liberal government of
Prime Minister Lester Pearson, died at his home after a long battle
with cancer. He was 69.
   Cardin, who died Monday, had been a judge of the Tax Court of
Canada since 1983.
   First elected to Parliament as Liberal member from Quebec in
1952, Cardin was re-elected six times before deciding not to run in
the 1968 general election.
   After the Liberals under Pearson formed a government in 1963,
Cardin was appointed associate defense minister, then public works
minister, and finally justice minister.
   His troubles as justice minister began in 1965 when he confirmed
on television that Victor Spencer, a Vancouver postal clerk, had
been spying for the Soviet Union.
   Spencer had admitted to spying and was fired by the post office
without a pension. He wasn't prosecuted because he was dying of
cancer.
   The opposition in Parliament contended that Spencer shouldn't
have been fired without being prosecuted. Cardin defended the
government's position.
   To save his government, Pearson had to agree to an opposition
demand for an investigation into the loss of Spencer's pension.
   The scandal grew when Cardin, under opposition attack for the
Liberals' handling of security cases, replied on March 4, 1966,
that the opposition had no business talking. Cardin then mentioned
an embarrassing case involving the Conservatives.
   Pearson had asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1964 for
all files on members of Parliament in which security was involved.
   As a result, he had been briefed on Gerda Munsinger, a German
call-girl and suspected Soviet agent who was considered a security
problem because of an affair with Pierre Sevigny. At the time,
Sevigny was associate defense minister in the Conservative
government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.
   Pearson had discussed the Munsinger affair privately with
Diefenbaker, but Cardin's blurted reference in Parliament was the
first public disclosure.
   Pearson appointed a justice of Canada's Supreme Court to look
into the matter, which aroused concern in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Cardin resigned as justice minister in 1967. He was member of
the immigration appeal board from 1970 to 1972 and served on the
tax review board that eventually became the Tax Court of Canada.
   He is survived by his wife Marcelle and four children.

<TEXT>
   Battling Southern Baptists headed
toward a showdown decision that would either curb rule of their
14.6-million member denomination by fundamentalists, or perpetuate
it for the next generation.
   More than at any time since the fundamentalist tide began
rolling nine years ago, moderates seemed to feel they had an even
chance of breaking it at this year's convention, which meets today.
   ``They have a chance because they have a good candidate,'' said
Toby A. Druin, of Dallas, assistant editor of the weekly Baptist
Standard, referring to the prospective moderate nominee for the
denominational presidency.
   The Rev. Richard Jackson, the moderate from Phoenix, Ariz., is
expected to be pitted against fundamentalist candidate Jerry Vines,
a minister from Jacksonville, Fla.
   The nominations and voting for president of the denomination,
the nation's largest Protestant body, come this afternoon.
   ``It's going to be neck and neck,'' said the Rev. Albert
McClellan of Nashville, Tenn., retired long-time denominational
executive.
   Through successive presidencies, whose appointments gradually
determine ruling trustees of the denomination's far-flung
operational network, fundamentalists nearly have completed their
takeover.
   Their timetable says one more year would seal the process.
   But moderates see signs that many who have supported
fundamentalists before think they have gone to excess in newly
restrictive measures on institutions and agencies, driving out some
widely respected personnel.
   Indications also have arisen of links between fundamentalist
strategists and the religious right on social-political issues.
   That gives the conflict a broad political tinge rather than it
being an intramural difference over Bible interpretation, as it
often has been pictured.
   ``People are becoming alarmed,'' McClellan said. ``There's a
definite swing against these extremes.''
   However, some peculiar back-stage maneuvering has gone on that
possibly could scuttle the expected contest between Jackson and
Vines.
   The Rev. John Bisagno of Houston suggested that to dampen the
head-on conflict, only one of the two be nominated as a consensus
candidate this year, the other two years hence.
   That seemed unlikely, but the possibility was discussed that
Bisagno himself might be nominated, which probably would reduce
chances of the moderate-backed Jackson.
   A hint of fundamentalist strength also came in a preconvention
pastors conference Monday afternoon when a fundamentalist, the Rev.
Ralph Smith of Austin, was elected president.
   He defeated a moderate, the Rev. Paul Powell of Tyler.
   The presidency of the pastor's conference has been a stepping
stone to the convention presidency for the last decade.
   Among the fundamentalist engineered steps that have intensified
controversy during the last year:
   _ Endorsement of Judge Robert Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court,
contrary to long-time denominational policy against siding for or
against specific candidates. The conservative Bork later withdrew
from the nomination.
   _ Adopting mission board policies against women clergy and
divorced ministers in most cases, and instituting screening of
personnel to assure that they took a literalist view of the Bible.
   _ Moves that drove from office the Rev. Randall Lolley as
president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake
Forest, N.C., and the Rev. Larry Baker as head of the
denomination's ethics agency, the Christian Life Commission.
   _ Ouster of the Rev. George Sheridan as head of a regional New
Jersey interfaith unit because he contended that God's covenant
with Jews remained valid.
   _ Pushing right-wing causes for capital punishment, prayer in
public schools, aid to religious schools, and against all abortions
except to save the mother's life.

   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling on vaccine liability
focused on the only common vaccine that can cause the disease it is
intended to prevent, experts say.
   The court ruled Monday that the federal government may be forced
to pay damages for polio resulting from the oral vaccine for that
disease.
   But in general, side effects from vaccines are rare, and ``it's
far better to be vaccinated than to get the disease,'' said G.
Scott Giebink, professor of pediatrics at the University of
Minnesota Medical School.
   Here are common vaccines and their side effects:
   _ Oral polio vaccine, which is given twice in the first year of
life with boosters in the second year and just before entering
school. It has no side effects other than rare cases of polio
paralysis, which occurs in about one out of every 3.2 million doses
of vaccine, Giebink said.
   The paralytic reaction is most common in people with hampered
immune systems, either the vaccinated child or a family member of a
vaccinated child, he said. The weakened virus used in the vaccine
can pass to a family member, possibly causing trouble if that
person's immune system is weakened, he said.
   _ Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, given at ages two
months, four months, six months, 15 months and at entry to school.
Pertussis is whooping cough.
   About one in 110,000 children who get the DTP vaccine develop a
brain dysfunction that can include seizures. It is usually
temporary. But about one in 310,000 vaccinated children get
permanent damage that includes mental retardation or movement
difficulties, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   Whether those problems are caused by the vaccine is
controversial, said Samuel Katz, chairman of the pediatrics
department at the Duke University Medical Center.
   Giebink said they appear to be linked to the vaccine because its
more mild side effects may lead to a doctor's examination, which
uncovers the serious problem that may gone unnoticed before the
inoculation.
   The mild side effects include muscle soreness and swelling at
the injection site, which occur in about half the injections, and
fever, in about one-fifth of immunizations, he said. About one in
2,000 children develops a fever and convulsions, without lasting
effects, he said.
   _ Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, given at age 18 months.
The disease being prevented is a potentially fatal infection that
can cause brain damage, pneumonia and other effects.
   The vaccine has no serious side effects, Giebink said. Fewer
than 1 percent of recipients get a fever, and one in five have arm
soreness or tenderness.
   _ Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine, given at age 15 months. No
serious side effects are known, although in very rare cases a spell
of fever and convulsions can follow the shot, Giebink said.
   Some children get a rash or slight fever lasting a few days.
About one in seven have a mild swelling of lymph glands in the
neck. About one in 50 teen-age or adult women experience a
short-lived aching or swelling of joints, he said.
   _ Influenza vaccine, given mostly to people in high-risk groups,
such as those with chronic lung or heart disease, and the elderly.
Despite publicity about a paralysis called Guillain-Barre syndrome
associated with swine flu vaccines in 1976, flu vaccines in general
cause no serious side effects, Giebink and Katz said.

   Chastity Bono, the 19-year-old daughter of Sonny
Bono and Cher, says she's a casual ``jeans and T-shirt'' kind of
person, unlike her fashion-plate mother.
   ``I was never into that from the start,'' Miss Bono says of her
mother's taste for flashy, provocative clothes.
   ``Chas,'' as she likes to be called, says in July's McCall's
magazine that living with Cher is ``never just a quiet day at home
with nobody around.''
   In contrast, she says, ``One thing I've always liked about being
at Dad's: It's always been really calm and normal. That serenity is
one thing he gave me that's really important.''
   The years after her parents divorced were difficult, Miss Bono
said.
   ``My parents weren't around a lot,'' she said. ``The divorce hit
when I was 3, and I would go back and forth between my parents'
houses _ crying for each one when I was with the other.''
   She said it took her awhile to adjust to the many companions of
both parents.
   ``It was difficult because I'd get attached to someone and
they'd leave,'' she said. ``But it didn't bother me after a while
because it was just their lives, not my life. And it isn't like
these people are coming in and trying to be my new mom and dad;
they're just friends.''

   Delicate threads are linking the affluent suburbs
of Chicago and the poverty-ridden slums of India, in a project
started by an Indian social worker.
   Pushpika Freitas, 31, describes her plan to market the clothing
and other handiwork of her native land as ``capitalism with a
conscience.''
   ``What we're doing is not only selling products and helping
people in India, but also educating some of the people here about
the different conditions there,'' said Ms. Freitas in a recent
interview.
   ``There's the whole aspect of brotherhood and sisterhood,
identifying with people on the other side of world who live in very
bad conditions but would really want to change their lives or
improve themselves.''
   Ms. Freitas, who divides her time between Bombay and Chicago,
founded the non-profit group called ``MarketPlace: Handwork of
India'' in 1986, to provide a marketing outlet in the United States
for the handmade crafts and clothing items.
   Since then, the volunteer agency has promoted the sale of about
$20,000 worth of goods in the United States, mostly through homes
and churches in Chicago's northern suburbs.
   Its first major experiment with a retail shop came this year
through Nomad's, an import handcraft store in suburban Evanston.
   More than $2,500 worth of the brightly colored patchwork and
intricately embroidered cotton clothing, bags and table mats has
been sold since the items went on display May 14.
   ``It's gone very well ... and we intend to continue what has
been a good relationship,'' said Catharine Cole, Nomad's owner.
   About 45 percent to 50 percent of the money from the sales goes
back to the Indian cooperatives that make the items. The rest
covers shipping fees, duties and promotional and office expenses.
   Ms. Freitas said Indian women who work as domestic servants earn
only about $15 to $20 a month for working 8 to 10 hours a day, 7
days a week. Through the cooperatives, she said, they can double
their earnings while working at home.
   Ms. Freitas has been involved with the cooperatives since she
returned to her native Bombay in 1979 after receiving her master's
degree in sociology from Chicago's De Paul University, where her
husband is a political science professor.
   She found women in Bombay to be ``the poorest of the poor,
unskilled and uneducated.''
   But she also found them motived to keep their families going.
   ``Being a woman, I empathized with their situation and wanted to
do something about this,'' she said.
   So in 1980, Ms. Freitas founded a patchwork cooperative with
three women in Bombay's Golibar slum district who made quilts,
cushion covers and garments.
   Now, the patchwork center provides work for 35 women who pick up
materials and instructions and work at home on a piece-work basis.
   There also are three other workshops employing 30 poor women and
handicapped men. Those workshops are a sewing shop, a hand-block
fabric printing shop and a silk screen shop, where workers are
trained to make stationery and ornamental paper.
   In 1985, Ms. Freitas helped launch a non-profit coalition of
cottage industries called SHARE, or Support the Handicapped
Rehabilitation Effort. It now works with about 25 cooperatives
around India, helping them with professional advice on sales and
marketing.
   ``All these things are important, otherwise these programs are
like charity under a different name,'' Ms. Freitas said. ``It's
teaching a man to fish rather than providing the fish.''
   The cooperatives produce goods like flowing caftain dresses,
needlepoint belts, embroidered blouses and stationery sets for
export.
   Many shirts and skirts go for $16, and the most expensive items
are huge quilts that cost $200 to $250.
   Ms. Freitas plans to introduce a mail order catalog by next
year. She acknowledges that it's been hard to interest major
retailers who are looking for bulk orders and uniform designs, but
she believes in her project.
   ``I am convinced that the products can really take off here in
the United States ... and make some significant changes ... in
India,'' she said.

   Europe this week will launch its biggest, most
versatile rocket ever, which could give it an edge over the United
States and other countries in the race to commercialize space.
   Ariane-4, which is to blast off Wednesday from the European
Space Agency's space center in Kourou, French Guiana, was declared
ready for service on Saturday. Fueling of the rocket began Sunday.
   The new generation rocket is designed to serve as Europe's
``workhorse on the world launch services market until the end of
this century,'' according to officials at Arianespace, the
commercial arm of the 13-nation European Space Agency consortium.
   The rocket will on its inaugural launch carry an international
payload of three satellites into orbit, demonstrating the vehicle's
space readiness to potential customers.
   Capable of carrying heavier payloads than previous Arianes, the
rocket is the most sophisticated the Europeans have ever produced.
Its design allows engineers to strap on different configurations of
solid and liquid boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's
specific budget and needs, the agency said.
   Developed over the past six years at a cost of $575 million,
Ariane-4 can carry a maximum load of 4.6 tons into orbit. Ariane-3,
the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8 tons.
   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloads.
As of May 25, the company held 67 launch contracts worth $3.4
billion.
   The United States and Japan have barely entered the race. But in
the coming years, Arianespace faces competition from the American
Titan-4 made by Martin Marietta Corp., Atlas-Centaur built by
General Dynamics and Delta made by McDonnell Douglas _ as well as
from the Soviet Proton, the Chinese Long March and the Japanese
H-2, now under development.
   The United States had been depending on its space shuttles as
the chief launchers of commercial satellites until Jan. 28, 1986,
when the shuttle Challenger exploded just after liftoff, killing
all seven crew members.
   There has not been a shuttle launch since. The next one is
expected late this summer.
   Even when the shuttles resume regular flights, their focus will
be on military and scientific missions, rather than commercial
operations.
   However, the Delta-2 will begin commercial flights this fall
with the Titan-3 scheduled to begin early next year. The
Atlas-Centaur is scheduled to take off with paying customers in the
middle of 1989.
   Previously, U.S. rockets lifted mostly military and scientific
loads under supervision of the U.S. Air Force or the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Arianespace officials consider the Titan rocket their toughest
competitor in the world market of about 25 launches a year. The
Titan is the only U.S. rocket able to haul satellites weighing more
than 2.7 tons.
   The main U.S. challenger may turn out to be the new Delta-2,
which will be bigger and more powerful than the current model.
   Arianespace plans to build and launch 70 of their new rockets
between now and 1995, when the Ariane-5 will be ready to fly.
   One of the three satellites due to be sent into space on
Wednesday, the Meteostat-P2, will be placed in orbit to furnish
weather data to 16 European countries.
   The 1,529-pound satellite will monitor weather over most of
Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of South
America. It replaces Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which until
recently sent back pictures of earth every half hour.
   The 330-pound Amsat-3C, known by the nickname Oscar-13, will
serve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world.
   PAS-1, a satellite owned by the American telecommunications
company Pan American Satellite, will further telecommunications
service at a moderate cost between Latin America, the United States
and Europe.
   It also will provide some Latin American countries with the
ability to create national television networks.

<HEAD>Dextran Sulfate May Help Block AIDS Infection</HEAD>

   A drug used for 20 years to lower
cholesterol and prevent blood clotting may help block AIDS
infection, according to preliminary tests in a U.S. government
laboratory.
   The drug, called dextran sulfate, protected immune system cells
from AIDS infection for more than two weeks in the laboratory, said
Hiroaki Mitsuya of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. He
reported his findings Monday at the Fourth International Conference
on AIDS.
   The first phase of human trials of the drug has just been
completed at San Francisco General Hospital, where doctors say it
is too soon to know whether it will perform as well in patients as
it does in the laboratory.
   ``For the most part, the drug was well tolerated'' by the
experimental subjects, said Dr. Donald Abrams, director of the
study.
   Some of the 30 patients who received varying doses of the drug
for up to eight weeks showed signs of liver abnormalities, a
lowering of white blood cell count and hyperexcitability _ but
there were no major side effects, he said.
   The study was designed only to determine whether the drug was
safe to give to AIDS patients, Abrams said. It is not approved for
use in the United States, but it has been used in Japan and
elsewhere as an anti-coagulant and cholesterol-lowering agent,
Abrams said.
   The researchers did notice, however, that the drug produced
slight elevation in the number of T4 cells in the subjects, Abrams
said. These cells are controllers of the body's immune system and
they are a principal target of the AIDS virus, which kills them.
   Many AIDS victims are obtaining dextran sulfate through illicit
channels and taking it on their own, which could be risky, Abrams
said.
   Many of these patients are also taking AZT, which can extend
life. The problem is that AZT is broken down in the liver and
dextran sulfate might disrupt liver function, Abrams said, thus
aggravating potentially serious side effects associated with AZT.
   Mitsuya, who works in the laboratory of Dr. Samuel Broder, one
of the leaders in the search for anti-AIDS drugs, said the
laboratory studies suggest dextran sulfate blocks the first step in
AIDS infection _ the attachment of the AIDS virus to the outside of
the T4 cells.
   Combinations of dextran sulfate and AZT suppress AIDS infection
in the laboratory even better than either drug does alone, Mitsuya
said.
   The virus of acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the
body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to a wide
variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

<HEAD>Beauty Pageant Contestant Hauled Off Stage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Marlise Ricardos, a drama major at the
University of Southern California, was crowned Miss California in a
finale marred when another contestant pulled out a banner saying
``Pageants Hurt All People.''
   Michelle Anderson, 21, who represented Santa Cruz County, was
pulled from the stage by security guards Monday night as she yelled
that the winner had bruises all over her body because she suffered
from a weight-loss illness, anorexia.
   The 26-year-old winner, who wore the banner of the city of
Lomita, had little to say about the incident.
   ``There's nothing I can really say at this moment that would be
in good taste so I'd rather not comment, but she and I don't see
eye to eye,'' said Miss Ricardos.
   The 65th Miss California pageant was the third at the San Diego
Civic Center, where it was moved from Santa Cruz after protests
with crowds up to 1,000 marred previous contests.
   Ten finalists chosen from a pool of 42 during preliminary
contests over the weekend participated in the finals televised
around the state. The judges rated the women on the basis of
swimsuit and talent competition and interviews.
   Miss Anderson, who wasn't one of the finalists, said she had
planned all year to stage the protest.
   ``The whole point is that pageants hurt all women,'' Miss
Anderson said outside the Civic Center. ``They hurt women who are
on the inside because they are bruised psychologically and
physically by what they must endure to become queens.
   ``Pageants hurt women on the outside because (the contestants)
are an icon that we must all look up to and that we're all supposed
to emulate, but that makes us unhealthy and promotes anorexia and
bulimia and cosmetic surgery.''
   Miss Ricardos will represent the state in the Miss America
Pageant in Atlantic City in September. She also won $20,000 in
scholarships, wardrobe money and gifts.
   Miss Ricardos, first runner up the past two years, said she
would use the money to further her college education and career.
She sang ``I Dreamed a Dream'' during the talent competition.
   ``It's extremely exciting because I've been working on this for
six years,'' Miss Ricardos said of the pageant. ``It's a wonderful
way for women to pay for their education.''
   In previous years, pageant protesters have focused on racism and
sexism they say is promoted by the contest. But, with the contest
itself 65-years-old, protesters said they decided to focus on age
discrimination.
   ``We're here to celebrate women's diversity,'' said Ann
Simonton, a 35-year-old former model who led the protest by a Santa
Cruz-based group, MediaWatch.
   Ms. Simonton, covergirl of the 1974 Sports Illustrated swimsuit
edition who has been arrested several times during previous
protests, wore a trash can with a banner that read, ``Mis-Erable.''
   ``I feel older women are ignored to a large degree in our
society and they're relegated to a trash can which is why I'm
emphasizing it by being dressed this way,'' Ms. Simonton said.
   Several dozen demonstrators wearing makeup, worn clothes and
wigs carried signs saying, ``Slaves to Stereotypes,'' ``There's
Life at 44, and ``Beauty Comes In All Types of Packages.''
   About a dozen police officers monitored the protests. There were
no arrests.
   Pageant organizers say the contest promotes the things for women
that protesters want, better education and equality in the work
place.

<HEAD>EEC To End Curbs on Capital Movements Starting in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIPPE NEURAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major step toward a unified European
market, the European Economic Community's finance ministers agreed
to remove all controls on capital flow within the Common Market
starting in 1990.
   Monday's accord will let EEC citizens open bank accounts and
obtain other financial services such as loans in any of the 12
Common Market member nations.
   EEC officials said this will spur more competition among banks
and create a single financial market competitive in size with the
United States and Japan.
   ``Creation of this large financial area ... should make it
possible for (EEC banks) to catch up with the financial centers in
Tokyo and New York,'' said Jacques Delors, president of the EEC's
executive commission.
   The accord figures in the EEC's ``Internal Market'' plan under
which all internal borders that still hamper a free flow of people,
goods and services are to by removed by 1992.
   ``The freedom of capital flows is an important step toward
creation of a European market and a monetary union,'' West German
Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, the meeting's chairman, told
reporters.
   Removal of the money controls is to take effect in eight of the
EEC's most developed nations on July 1, 1990.
   Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland may retain their controls
until the end of 1992 and Greece and Portugal will be allowed to
extend the transition period until 1995.
   Of the other eight, only France, Italy and Denmark still
maintain strict controls on capital. The others already have fully
liberalized their capital markets.
   The accord was reached despite last-minute concerns by France
and Denmark that the measure would encourage tax evasion and fraud.
   Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy of France first sought to link
the capital liberalization to a requirement the EEC mandate equal
tax levels throughout the trade bloc.
   This was firmly rejected by Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor
of the Exchequer, who said it would force his country to levy
unpopular sales taxes on food, children's clothing and other items.
   In the end, the ministers asked the EEC Commission to study the
issue and make any tax equalization proposals by June 30, 1989. But
a vote on these must be unanimous, effectively giving Britain a
veto right while the accord to free capital flows would proceed on
schedule regardless of the outcome.
   ``All in all, it was a useful day's work,'' Lawson told
reporters after the meeting. ``The liberalization of capital
markets goes ahead on schedule.''
   ``It's very happy news because if we had not managed to come to
an agreement today, it would have put the creation of a unified
internal market in the EEC by 1992 in a very bad light,'' said an
EEC Commission official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The ministers also resolved objections by Denmark, which feared
the accord would interfere with very strict reporting of interest
payments to the tax authorities.
   Officials said it was agreed that Danes with bank accounts
elsewhere in the EEC must continue to report the bank account to
Danish authorities and promise to let the bank provide all
requested information to the tax authorities.
   The ministers also resolved a variety of other concerns of
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, which have highly protected
banking sectors and which expressed fears of massive capital
outflows in a free market.
   Under the accord, countries may impose temporary capital curbs
for up to six months, in periods of stress without prior approval
from the EEC Commission. After that six-month period, the controls
must be reviewed and approved by the Commission
   The ministers also provided for a fund of $19.2 billion to help
central banks cope with any imbalances in capital flows resulting
from the new legislation.
   The accord must now be approved by the European Parliament, but
officials said that was a formality.

   A swanky Manhattan restaurant that decided to
offer the same elaborate meal, including turtle soup, seen in the
Oscar-winning Danish film ``Babette's Feast'' is in hot water with
animal rights activists.
   Mike Weber of the Center for Environmental Education complains
that the Petrossian restaurant is encouraging people to eat
turtles, some of which are endangered.
   ``It's turtle exploitation,'' said Jim Van Abbena of the New
York Turtle and Tortoise Society.
   Petrossian, however, says its ``Potage a la Tortue'' is made
with the common freshwater snapping turtle, not the endangered sea
turtles used in the movie's soup.
   The soup is the first course in the $125-a-head dinner, which
also comes with four wines.
   The food consultant who created the ``Babette's Feast'' menu has
come up with a ``mock'' turtle recipe using duck or Japanese
mushrooms, but Petrossian general manager Dro Proudian has not
decided whether to use it.
   The food-obsessed movie won this year's best foreign film Oscar.

   Iranian gunboats attacked a
Singapore-flagged oil tanker with machine guns and set it on fire
today in the Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported.
   It was the second time in four days that Iranians raided a
tanker near Iran's Farsi island off Saudi Arabia's coast.
   The shipping sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
identified today's target as the 87,768-ton Neptune Subaru. No
casualties were reported.
   They said its Asian crew, including a Sri Lankan captain and
sailors from Malaysia, Singapore and India, put out the fires, and
the vessel sailed under its own power to the Saudi Arabian port of
Jubail for inspection.
   The Neptune Subaru was also hit by the Iranians in the Strait of
Hormuz, gateway to the gulf, in March, the executives said.
   The tanker was empty and heading for Kuwait for a shipment of
crude oil when the gunboats opened fire early today in a 45-minute
raid.
   Farsi island is a base for Iran's Revolutionary Guards, who
often attack ships sailing to and from Kuwait. They also have been
blamed for mining the waterway.
   The U.S. Navy has mounted a major mine-sweeping operation and
sent several warships to patrol in the area. It was not immediately
clear if any U.S. warship was nearby when the Neptune Subaru was
attacked today.
   The vessel was about 40 miles west of Farsi, near the Saudi
island of Hurqus. Iran had attacked several ships in that area
earlier in the so-called ``tanker war,'' an offshoot of the
7{-year-old gulf war.
   In the exchanges, Iraq attacks Iran's vital oil shipping lanes
to try to throttle its foe's economy. Iran retaliates by raiding
neutral vessels, mainly those trading with Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
   The Persian state accuses these two oil powers of aiding Iraq's
military effort.
   Shipping sources said the skipper of the Neptune Subaru appeared
to be on his first trip into the gulf.
   ``This captain, like others we encounter, came to the gulf with
no prior knowledge whatsoever about the dangers of the tanker war
or what precautions should be taken against ship attacks,'' said a
shipping official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Saturday, the Iranians attacked the U.S.-owned,
British-flagged Esso Demetia supertanker about 120 miles south of
where the Neptune Subaru was raided. A U.S. frigate rushed to the
scene, but its help was not needed.
   Kuwait registered 11 of its tankers in the United States last
year to entitle them to U.S. warship protection.
   The Pentagon recently broadened the task of the U.S. Navy in the
gulf by allowing warships to intervene in attacks on foreign
commercial ships.
   Before the new policy went into effect May 3, the Navy was
allowed to offer only humanitarian assistance.
   But Iran has struck seven vessels in the waterway since then in
apparent defiance of the Navy.

   Showers and thunderstorms converged on the South and Midwest
today, bringing drenching rains to the Texas Panhandle, after much
of the North sweltered in a record-breaking heat wave.
   The thunderstorm system rumbled through northeastern New Mexico,
southwest Kansas and the Texas Panhandle, and a flash flood watch
was in effect for a number of counties in the southwest Panhandle.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across Minnesota and
the Dakotas, with the most intense thunderstorms in eastern South
Dakota and southwestern Minnesota.
   Showers and thunderstorms also lingered over southern Florida.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with clear
skies over much of America's eastern half.
   On Monday, the heat wave scorched sections of Wisconsin. At
Green Bay's, Austin Straubel Airport, the temperature hit 94
degrees, surpassing the 1956 record high of 93.
   In Michigan, Marquette reported a 93-degree high, the sixth day
this month a record mark was set there. The old record of 85
degrees was set in 1976. In Alpena, the temperature reached 94,
breaking the old record set that year by 2 degrees.
   The high for the nation Monday was 107 degrees at Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for showers through northern Maine and
southern Florida; showers and thunderstorms from northern Minnesota
to North Dakota, eastern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska and eastern
Montana; and sunny skies over much of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s over northern Maine,
from northern Minnesota to North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, western
South Dakota, the Nebraska Panhandle and northern Colorado, as well
as along the California coast; in the 90s from New England to
Virginia, over the Ohio Valley and the Tennessee Valley, across
lower Michigan and Wisconsin, from Iowa to Louisiana, over the
eastern portion of the central Plains and much of Texas; reaching
the 90s from southwest Oregon to inland northern and central
California; and 100 to 110 degrees through the desert Southwest;
and in the 80s over the rest of the country.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 87 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Communist gunmen critically wounded a
city policeman bathing outside his home today and scattered
leaflets claiming responsibility for the attack, authorities and
witnesses said.
   It was the second rebel attack on policemen in two days in the
capital area.
   Police and witnesses said patrolman Gilbert dela Cruz was taking
a bath outside his house in a slum district when four armed men
arrived. One acted as a lookout while the others fired at dela
Cruz, police said.
   They said the anti-narcotics officer was in critical condition
in a hospital with four gunshot wounds in the head and body.
   ``We're sure that the attackers were communist rebels,'' Lt.
Loreto Idanan said.
   He said that before escaping into an ally in the crowded
neighborhood, the gunmen scattered copies of a statement
identifying themselves as members of the Alex Boncayao Brigade.
   The group is the Manila unit of the communist New People's Army.
The communists have fought a 20-year insurgency against the
national government.
   In the statement, the brigade accused dela Cruz of extortion, of
helping organize a local anti-communist vigilante group, and of
executing suspected rebel supporters.
   On Monday, two gunmen shot to death a police intelligence
officer in the Manila suburb of Pasay. Police said the gunmen also
belonged to the brigade, which has been blamed for killing at least
30 policemen and soldiers and 24 civilians in the Manila area this
year.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's 60,000 unionized civil servants began
an indefinite strike today, disrupting work at courts and hospitals
and bringing the nation's railway to a halt.
   The strike also affected the Interior Ministry, which stopped
issuing passports and identity cards, the Employment Service and
the National Insurance Institute.
   At Ben Gurion International Airport, an emergency staff of only
10 out of 180 customs officials checked the luggage of passengers
on incoming flights, Israel army radio reported.
   A soldier guarding the Tel-Aviv-Haifa railway station told the
radio he had to inform train passengers about the strike.
   ``They were amazed ... and thought I was joking. But after they
heard, everybody said something, with all sorts of curses,'' the
soldier said.
   A cab driver taking passengers from Tel Aviv to Haifa said,
``When there's a strike, there's more work, but we prefer no
strikes and order in the country.''
   Tax offices were closed and disruptions were reported at the
government-run hospitals where the strike affected administrative
and maintenance staff. The Educational Television stopped its
broadcasts, and court clerks did not report to work.
   The strike came after the failure of seven hours of talks Monday
between the union of civil servants and the Finance Ministry.
   Yakov Danon, the Finance Ministry's wage coordinator, warned
that the ministry was ready to issue back-to-work orders. According
to media reports, the ministry has also told the strikers it would
exclude the strike days from their salaries.
   But union secretary Reuven Ben-Ami said the civil servants,
whose average monthly salary is about $625, are ``ready to
sacrifice to achieve better wages.''
   ``We shall consider the continuation of the strike today. It may
take several more days or stop tonight,'' Ben-Ami said on army
radio.
   Union officials said they are demanding an average wage increase
of $77, a raise in medical payments and an increase in the annual
recreation period covered by these payments to 15 days instead of
11.

<HEAD>FBI Seeks Man Suspected in 30 Bank Robberies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank robber dubbed ``the
gentleman bandit'' because of his penchant for three-piece suits
and his soft-spoken manner in dozens of holdups, has changed his
clothes and his pattern, says the FBI.
   The robber, who's averaged one to three holdups a month since
his 30-bank spree in Georgia and South Florida began in 1986,
pulled his last heist in Naples on March 21, FBI spokesman Paul
Miller said in asking the public for help Monday.
   ``It does look like his pattern has been broken, but whether
he's been arrested for something else or is sick from narcotics
abuse, we don't know,'' Miller said. ``That's part of the reason we
want to get some publicity.''
   The bandit, who is about 30 years old, could be pulling the
robberies to feed a drug habit, Miller said. Investigators base
that theory on photographs taken during robberies that show the man
growing thinner.
   The bandit also has recently stowed his three-piece suit for
more casual garb, and has shaved off his beard, FBI officials said.
   The robber usually carries a folder or accordion-type briefcase,
Miller said. While the soft-spoken man has threatened bodily harm
in notes to tellers, he rarely displays a weapon and no one has
been hurt.
   Thousands of dollars have been taken, but Miller did not give an
amount.
   Because of the robber's mobility and familiarity with different
cities and exit routes, investigators believe he has a legitimate
job, possibly as a traveling salesman, Miller said.
   Investigators speculate the man does not live near the banks he
robs because no one has come forward to help identify him, even
though robbery photos have been publicized.
   ``We're hoping somebody who owns a motel or a hotel might
recognize him as a steady client,'' Miller said.

<HEAD>Armenian Strike Eases, Azerbaijan Turns Down Annexation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Armenians ending strike,
Azerbaijan rejecting annexation appeal. No pickup. Changes byline</NOTE>

   Many Armenians who joined a strike to demand
annexation of a disputed region of neighboring Azerbaijan returned
to work today after being assured that their republic's government
would press their demand.
   But the Azerbaijani government voted to reject ceding control of
the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is predominantly Armenian.
   Mofses Gorgisyan, an Armenian jailed in April and May for
staging nationalist demonstrations, said a general strike shut down
most businesses in Armenia on Monday, but that today ``some people
are working, maybe half.''
   He said students agitating for annexation had for three weeks
staged a sit-in outside the Opera Theater in Yerevan, capital of
the southern republic.
   Nagorno-Karabakh was assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923. Most
Azerbaijanis are Moslems and most Armenians are Christians.
   Azerbaijan's official Baku Radio reported today that the
executive committee of that republic's legislature met Monday in
the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, and turned down a request by
Nagorno-Karabakh officials that their territory be transferred to
Armenia.
   The report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London, said the Presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet found
the demand ``unacceptable'' because it would be ``contrary to the
interests of the Azerbaijani and Armenian population of the
republic and would be incompatible with the tasks of consolidating
the friendship between all the peoples of our country, as well as
with the task of reconstruction.''
   It said the annexation request came from the Nagorno-Karabakh
Autonomous Region's Soviet of People's Deputies, one of two
chambers of the region's legislature. A request from the same body
in February touched off massive street demonstrations and strikes
in Nagorno-Karabakh and Yerevan.
   Armenia's legislature is to meet Wednesday to discuss the
annexation demand.
   Armenia's new Communist Party leader, Suren Arutyunyan, told
more than 500,000 demonstrators in Yerevan on Monday that the
Armenian Supreme Soviet would ``decide positively'' on their claim,
according to Gorgisyan and Sergei Grigoryants, a dissident
journalist in Moscow.
   Gorgisyan quoted Arutyunyan as saying a majority of Supreme
Soviet deputies indicated they support annexation. He said the
speech was replayed three times on Armenian television, apparently
in an effort to persuade people to return to their jobs.
   Since the Azerbaijani legislature has rejected the annexation
demand, if the Armenian Supreme Soviet calls for transfer of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the issue would have to be decided by the central
government in Moscow.
   Moscow officials have rejected the demand once.
   Gorgisyan said Armenians believe the next move is up to Moscow:
``We are interested in Moscow's answer. Moscow has been silent so
far.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev got involved in the issue in
February, appealing to Armenians and Azerbaijanis to be calm and
promising the dispute would be reviewed.
   The Kremlin later rejected the annexation demand and the central
government instead approved a package of social and cultural
improvements for Nagorno-Karabakh.
   According to Gorgisyan, three Armenians have been lying on the
square outside the Opera Theater on a hunger strike since June 4.
He estimated that 2,000 to 5,000 people were gathered on the
square, where the latest round of demonstrations began May 25.
   A worker at the Yerevan Hotel said the general strike was still
on and demonstrators were making speeches and holding posters.
``It's very peaceful. People are highly cultured,'' said the
worker. The phone conversation was cut off before a reporter could
ask the woman's name.
   The ethnic dispute has erupted into violence several times. In
late February and early March 32 people, mostly Armenians, were
killed in riots in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.
   On Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
an Azerbaijani officer was killed by shotgun fire from an Armenian
during protests in Baku. He did not say precisely when the shooting
occurred.
   There were unconfirmed reports Saturday of large-scale protests
in Baku.
   Also Monday, the party leader of Azerbaijan, Abdul Rahman
Vezirov, told workers in Baku that they were correct in resisting
Armenians' demands to give up Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Communist Party authorities put Vezirov in charge of Azerbaijan
and Arutyunyan in charge of Armenia on May 21, apparently firing
their predecessors for not containing the dispute.

   A man who romanced a cashier, robbed her and
beat her to death with a hammer was electrocuted today, becoming
the nation's 100th person executed since capital punishment resumed
in 1977.
   Edward R. Byrne Jr., 28, had argued that he did not intend to
kill the woman during the 1984 gas station robbery. But he said
Monday he had dated her with the intent of robbing her, knowing she
handled large sums of money. And he said when he tried to knock her
unconscious, ``It didn't work. She didn't become unconscious. I
just kept hitting her until she did.''
   Eighteen of the 100 executions since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty have been in Louisiana, which is tied
with Florida for the second-highest number nationally. Texas has
put 27 people to death.
   Thirty-seven states enacted capital punishment laws after the
1976 Supreme Court ruling.
   A coroner pronounced Byrne dead at 12:12 a.m., said Jim Morris,
deputy secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and
Corrections.
   Three state and federal courts Monday refused requests by
Byrne's lawyers to block the execution. Louisiana's Pardon Board
also refused to recommend a commutation of his sentence to life
imprisonment.
   Six pro-capital punishment demonstrators waited outside the
prison for confirmation of Byrne's death. One held a sign reading
``Thanks, Sam Jones,'' alluding to the pseudonym used by officials
to protect the anonymity of the executioner.
   The sign-carrier identified himself as Johnny Reece of
Pineville. He said he felt deprived because the man who killed his
16-year-old stepdaughter was sentenced to life imprisonment.
   ``It gives us a sense of justice to see this done to him
(Byrne),'' Reece said. ``It doesn't make me happy to see someone
die, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction to see justice
served.''
   Byrne showed no emotion when he entered the death chamber. Asked
if he had any final words, Byrne smirked, shook his head and
replied: ``Nope.''
   After he was strapped into the electric chair and masked, Byrne
drummed his fingers while awaiting the first of four surges of
electricity.
   Byrne, who was convicted of first-degree murder, insisted he
never intended to kill Roberta Johnson, 25, who was bludgeoned with
a hammer during the $7,000 robbery at the Bossier City service
station.
   ``I don't know exactly what it is that I can say to y'all. I was
planning to rob this woman all along. It was all set up. There were
no flaws that I could see,'' Byrne said in a pardon board hearing
Monday at the penitentiary.
   Defense attorneys and a university professor who came to know
Byrne portrayed him as a penitent killer and as a sensitive,
articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to
loved ones.
   ``It was a premeditated robbery, but not a premeditated murder.
This was a robbery that went sour,'' defense attorney Nancy
Baumgartner said.
   But District Attorney Henry Brown called Byrne manipulative,
roguish and cruel.
   Brown said Byrne was caught in a hotel room the morning after
the killing, with a barmaid he had picked up at a tavern and
proposed marriage to. Parked outside was a car Byrne had stolen
from the woman he lived with before getting involed with Johnson,
the prosecutor said.
   Byrne's court appeals were based on numerous arguments, among
them that he should have had 90 days to appeal an adverse federal
appeals court ruling handed down May 9.
   But those arguments were turned aside Monday by the Louisiana
Supreme Court, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and, finally,
the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Hilton Butler, warden of the Louisiana State Penitentiary, said
Byrne spent Monday alone or with his lawyers. Butler described
Byrne as ``calm'' Monday night. Gov. Buddy Roemer made no effort to
intervene in the first execution since he took office in March.

   Police stormed a barricaded church run by
a fundamentalist minister, taking custody of some of his supporters
and residents of the home for troubled youths he operated.
   At least seven people, including the church's assistant pastor,
were arrested Monday at Bethel Baptist Church, authorities said.
   At least three dozen children were taken from the church after
about 60 state troopers, local police officers and sheriff's
deputies entered it following a four-hour standoff, witnesses said.
   Law officers, who were searching for three children who returned
to the home after a judge temporarily closed it, moved into the
white wood-frame church after unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a
settlement.
   As officers entered the building, some church members sang hymns
and quoted Scripture. Some asked, ``If this isn't Nazi Germany,
what is?''
   The state Department of Public Welfare took custody of 11
children after they were interviewed, but it was uncertain if all
had been former residents of the Bethel Home for Children.
   Authorities said they took all the youngsters in the church
because church officials refused to point out the three who had
returned to the home after its closing.
   Bethel Baptist's pastor, the Rev. Herman Fountain, was arrested
twice Monday, the first time along with two staff members and a
17-year-old after a fight broke out at the home.
   The second arrest came after Fountain got involved in a shoving
match with a law officer outside the courthouse.
   On Friday, Chancery Judge Robert Oswald ordered all the
residents of the school temporarily placed in state custody.
   Oswald ruled that the children, ages 10 to 17, had been
subjected ``to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention
amounting to imprisonment.''
   The public welfare department removed 64 children, but many
others fled the home. Twenty-two of the 64 were released over the
weekend to parents or guardians, state officials said.
   On Monday, Oswald began hearing the cases of the 42 youngsters
placed in state custody.
   Fountain refused to respond to Oswald's questions about the
whereabouts of the runaways, and the judge issued 11 subpoenas to
the home's staff members.
   Fountain returned to the campus in the early afternoon and told
staff members not to comply with the subpoenas.
   After the shoving match, Fountain _ with no shoes, his hair and
clothes ruffled _ was returned to court, where he told Oswald that
he was sheltering three children, but would answer no other
questions.
   Oswald asked Fountain to help prevent ``any bloodshed or
violence,'' but the Baptist minister said there was nothing he
could do.
   After the report of the campus fracas in which Fountain was
arrested, Oswald asked that a grand jury be called to consider
whether Fountain should be indicted for obstruction of justice.
   Oswald said at the end of the day he had released seven children
to their parents after reviewing their cases. He said they agreed
not to send their children back to the school without court
approval.
   Earlier, Fountain said he believed the home had housed about 120
children. He said he did not know the whereabouts of those missing.
   The number of children at large was unknown because Fountain
refused to honor a court order to provide a list with names and
addresses of the children and their parents.
   Outside court, several parents said they wanted their children
back in the home rather than the state's custody.
   Pat Green of Boca Raton, Fla., who said she had a 16-year-old
son at Bethel, said she and her husband refused to pick him up
because they did not want to sign the agreement that would bar him
from returning to the home.
   ``Brother Fountain through Bethel saved our child's life,'' she
said. ``When a child is on drugs, you need the help of religion to
get off drugs.''
   State Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain said Saturday that
medical examinations of some children showed excessive use of
corporal punishment.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was little changed in Europe this
morning as markets awaited the release later in the day of U.S.
trade data. Gold made slight gains.
   Dealers said the dollar might strengthen if forecasters were
correct in predicting an increase in the U.S. trade gap from $11.95
billion in March to a seasonally adjusted $12.2 billion in April.
   One dealer in Frankfurt said this would leave the dollar room to
rise, but another said:
   ``There was a lot of optimism after the last (trade) figures,
but the new figures will remind the market that the deficit is
still around, and that it won't fall below $10 billion any time
soon. And the central banks don't want the dollar to rise either.''
   A dealer in Milan commented: ``Any result above $12 billion will
just remind traders how stubborn a problem the U.S. trade imbalance
is.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.14 yen to a closing 125.05. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 125.12 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.7249 West German marks, up from 1.7241
   _ 1.4414 Swiss francs, down from 1.4424
   _ 5.8210 French francs, up from 5.7265
   _ 1.9349 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9345
   _ 1.281.00 Italian lire, down from 1,281.75
   _ 1.2185 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2203
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8150, compared
with $1.8165 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $450.20 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $449.00. At mid-morning Tuesday, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$450.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $450.70, up from $448.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, where trading resumed following a long
weekend, gold closed down $5.41 at a bid $452.58.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.98 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $7.02.

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of small to moderate
earthquakes that have shaken California from nearly one end to the
other the past few days are unrelated, a seismologist says.
   The latest quake, measuring 3.0 on the Richter scale, shook this
coastal community Monday. No injuries or damage were reported, said
Robert Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of Technology's
seismology lab in Pasadena.
   It followed a 2.3 magnitude quake Monday morning centered in the
Playa del Rey area near Los Angeles International Airport.
   The two Southern California quakes and more than a dozen quakes
and aftershocks that rattled Northern and Southern California over
the weekend occurred on different faults, said Caltech seismologist
Kate Hutton. While their timing was ``slightly odd,'' she said, it
was only coincidental.
   On Sunday evening, a quake centered 10 miles northeast of San
Jose in Northern California and measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale
broke windows, emptied supermarket shelves and knocked children off
their feet.
   That afternoon, a 3.4 quake rolled through the Ontario area, 30
miles inland from Los Angeles. Twenty-four minutes later a 3.3
quake jolted Napa and Solano counties in Northern California. No
damage or injuries were reported in either.
   On Friday, a 5.2 quake hit the Garlock fault near Gorman, 60
miles north of downtown Los Angeles.2 on the Richter scale. It was
followed by two aftershocks measuring 4.0 and 3.4. That quake
forced the temporary closure of the 440-mile California Aqueduct.
Two Civil War-era buildings at the Fort Tejon State Historic Park
also suffered quake damage.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, one measuring 4 can cause moderate damage
and one at 5 can cause considerable damage. Quakes of higher
magnitude can cause severe damage.

   Two militant Sikh separatists rushed out
of the Golden Temple complex today, attacked paramilitary troops
with swords and wounded two before they were shot dead, police said.
   Elsewhere in Punjab state, a gang of Sikh extremists raided a
village north of Amritsar on Monday night and shot nine people to
death, including eight Hindus, police said. One of the victims was
a 10-year-old girl.
   The attack at the Golden Temple occurred just outside the main
entrance, where police set up a post a month ago to search
everybody entering the Sikh religion's holiest shrine.
   The searches are intended to keep Sikh extremists from sneaking
weapons into the shrine. Sikh radicals have been fighting a
guerrilla war since 1982 for a separate homeland in Punjab.
   The two Sikh radicals apparently had escaped earlier police
detection, said M.S. Sethi, superintendent of the paramilitary
Central Reserve Police Force.
   They grabbed swords from shops near the temple gate and began
slashing at paramilitary forces, Sethi said. He said two of his men
were wounded before the assailants were shot to death by other
troops.
   Police and paramilitary forces besieged the Golden Temple May
9-18 to drive out extremists who had turned the shrine into an
armed camp. At least 46 people were killed during the siege, most
of them militants. More than 200 radicals and sympathizers
surrendered.
   The government has begun buying and demolishing buildings with
30 yards of the Golden Temple complex to prevent extremists from
using them as cover to sneak into the shrine.
   The attack on the Hindus Monday night was in the village of
Chakpamani, about 22 miles north of Amritsar. Police said up to 10
Sikh extremists arrived at the village on foot and entered several
Hindu homes, killing seven people.
   The Sikh servant of the village's Hindu leader, Kishan Chand,
tried to ward off the attackers but was killed, police said.
Chand's 10-year-old daughter was shot to death, but Chand escaped
injury, they said.
   The killings in Chakpamani raised to nearly 1,290 the number of
people killed by Sikh extremists in Punjab since the start of the
year. Last year, 1,030 people died.
   Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed
to the separatist campaign.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million people
but are a majority in Punjab.

   A 200-pound black bear found lounging in a
high school field in this New York City suburb kept students in
school before being tranquilized and removed, police said.
   A mailman sighted the 6-foot-tall bear at 1:45 p.m. Monday. The
bruin later was found lingering in the fenced-in field between
Waldwick High School and a house, said police dispatcher Andrew
Sansone.
   Police were called, and hundreds of high school students were
forbidden to walk home past the area, Sansone said. The students
were held in school an extra 45 minutes until parents or others
picked them up.
   Residents threw peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches inside the
fence for the bear as local officials awaited state Division of
Fish, Game and Wildlife officers, the dispatcher said.
   The bear was shot with a tranquilizer gun after spending several
hours up a tree, Sansone said. It was to be released to a more
remote, wooded area of the state.
   Bear sightings in Waldwick are rare, the dispatcher said.

<HEAD>`Super Spreader' Infects At Least Four Women With AIDS</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with discovery of new AIDS
virus gene. Picks up 9th graf pvs, `Dr. Anthony ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California man doctors call the
``super spreader'' has infected at least four women with AIDS and
is still having sexual encounters, according to a report released
today.
   ``He has infected four out of five of his partners that we have
seen, but we don't know all of his partners,'' said Dr. Nancy
Padian of the University of California at Berkeley.
   In other research presented today, Dr. William Haseltine of the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston described the discovery of a
gene in the AIDS virus that seems to slow the virus' proliferation
inside the body.
   Ms. Padian said the ``super spreader'' _ a hemophiliac infected
through contaminated blood products _ is in his 20s, lives in
southern California and is still healthy with no signs of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   Ms. Padian outlined the outbreak attributed to this man as part
of a study of infection rates among women who engage in risky sex.
   ``He is now using condoms,'' she said. ``We asked him to tell''
women about his AIDS infection, ``but we can't guarantee he is
doing that.''
   Ms. Padian and Haseltine dsecribed their findings at the Fourth
International Conference on AIDS.
   Haseltine said the new gene, dubbed vpu, has been isolated by
his and two other research labs.
   ``The virus without this gene grows faster,'' he said.
   He said the gene is one of four in the complex AIDS avirus that
regulate the speed with which it makes new copies of itself inside
infected cells.
   ``Now we have two genes that speed the virus up and two that
slow it down,'' Haseltine said.
   Researchers believe it may be possible to shut down the AIDS
virus with drugs that could manipulate the microbe's built-in
control genes.
   Among research described at the meeting Monday:
   _Dr. Anthony Adams of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said
that between 20 and 25 health care workers around the world have
become infected with AIDS as a result of on-the-job exposure to the
virus.
   ``We are now almost a decade since the transmission of the virus
became reasonably common,'' he said. ``We are still looking at a
very small number of people who get infected in the health-care
setting.''
   _Dr. Samuel Broder of the U.S. National Cancer Institute said
that the experimental anti-AIDS drug CD4 ``still looks very
promising,'' despite concerns that it may not protect against the
spread of AIDS to the brain.
   _Dr. Jay Levy of the University of California at San Francisco
said it appears that some of the body's own antibodies actually
help the AIDS virus get into blood cells. He said vaccine
developers should be careful not to accidentally aid the virus by
prompting the body to make antibodies that the microbe needs.
   _Researchers from three countries presented six cases in which
babies caught the AIDS virus while breast feeding. They said the
risk appears to be especially high if the mother becomes infected
with the virus after she gives birth.
   _Dr. James Goedert of the National Cancer Institute said the
approximately 1 million Americans already carrying the virus are
growing more infectious, so they are more likely to spread the
disease to uninfected people.
   _Dr. Timothy Dondero reported the first results of the CDC's
efforts to learn how many Americans are infected with the AIDS
virus by testing blood from hospital patients. In testing in six
hospitals, three of every 1,000 people were infected, but the rate
does not appear to be increasing.
   _Dr. Bosenge N'Galy of the Zaire Department of Public Health
said the infection rate also seems to have stabilized in Kinshasa,
the nation's capital. It has remained at about 7 percent among
pregnant women since 1985.
   _Dr. Hiroaki Mitsuya of the National Cancer Institute said that
dextran sulfate, a drug used to lower cholesterol, may block AIDS
infection.
   In the California study, Ms. Padian said the ``super spreader''
was somehow more infectious than most carriers of the virus,
perhaps because he was infected with a more contagious variety of
the AIDS virus.
   Dr. George Seague III of Boston's Department of Health and
Hospitals said, ``It's very feasible that this phenomenon might
occur. Some strains of the virus might be more readily spread.''
   Ms. Padian said one of the infected women had sex with the man
704 times, one 300 times and one 15 times. The fourth did not know
how many contacts she'd had.
   She said her research on other women shows a tremendous
variation in infectivity from person to person.
   Seven women studied got the virus after less than 100 sexual
encounters with infected men, while 19 others remained free of the
virus after more than 1,000 exposures.

   A Norwegian unit of the U.N. peacekeeping
force was locked in a tense confrontation with Israeli troops in
southern Lebanon today, U.N. sources said.
   Elsewhere in southern Lebanon, four Lebanese villagers were
killed and four others wounded when Israeli gunners shelled Shiite
Moslem guerrilla hideouts in Tibnin valley before dawn, police said.
   U.N. sources said Norwegian and Israeli troops faced each other
through the night, fingers on triggers, as flares illuminated the
skies over the foothills of Mount Hermon.
   ``They're still squared off in a tense confrontation,'' one U.N.
source said at midmorning. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The source said the tension developed after Norwegian
peacekeepers blocked Israeli troops two days ago from setting up a
checkpoint close to a Norwegian outpost on the southern edge of
Hebbariyeh.
   The village is seven miles north of Israel's self-designated
security zone in south Lebanon. It has a Norwegian garrison of nine.
   The source said a mechanized Israeli unit rolled into Hebbariyeh
Monday, encircled the Norwegian checkpoint and ``warned the
peacekeepers that they will be treated as trespassers on Israeli
territory if they leave their post.''
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel confirmed the confrontation and said
20 Israeli troops in two armored personnel carriers and a bulldozer
were surrounding the Norwegian position.
   Goksel said 50 other Norwegian troops were dispatched to
Hebbariyeh to help the encircled position. They removed barbed-wire
barricades set by the Israelis around the checkpoint, he said.
   Norway has an 881-strong battalion in the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon. UNIFIL comprises 5,800 troops drawn from nine nations.
   UNIFIL deployed in south Lebanon in 1978 to serve as a buffer
between Palestinian guerrillas and Israel's northern border. Its
area overlaps with the security zone Israel carved out in south
Lebanon in 1985.
   ``UNIFIL is against any Israeli position to be set up in UNIFIL
area because it will cause a lot of tension,'' Goksel said.
   He said contacts were under way to ease the Hebbariyeh tension,
which he said was still running high this morning.
   Police said the Tibnin valley shelling apparently was prompted
by reports in the security zone of ``abnormal guerrilla activity in
the area.''
   Thirty mortar rounds crashed in and around Tibnin overnight. All
eight casualties were civilians, police said.

   An Avianca Airlines jumbo jet seized June 4 after
422 pounds of cocaine was found in a shipment of cut flowers has
been released, and the national airline of Colombia has agreed to
halt shipments, officials say.
   The Customs Service said Monday that Avianca has decided to
suspend flower shipments, but airline sources have said the carrier
will halt all cargo shipments to the United States after June 23.
   Under an agreement with Customs, Avianca also said it will
``make substantial efforts to persuade the Colombian government to
make much greater efforts to prevent criminal elements in Colombia
from using commercial aircraft for the smuggling of controlled
substances to the United States.''
   Customs issued a $6.8 million penalty notice after the seizure
of the Boeing 747; Avianca has advised Customs it will petition to
reduce the amount.
   The seized jet had been making about 22 flights a month from
Colombia to Miami carrying an average of 6,1000 boxes of flowers
per flight.
   The perishable shipments of roses and carnations have been one
of the favorite hiding place for drug smugglers, drug investigators
say. Inspectors have seized 14 Avianca shipments since January
1986, including eight flower shipments that yielded 1,677 pounds of
cocaine.

   Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita calls on
President Reagan today after meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz to discuss East-West relations and the Middle East peace
process.
   Italy's agreement to provide a home for 72 American fighter jets
shares room with the forthcoming economic summit on De Mita's
agenda here.
   Also on the agenda are Reagan's recent summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and arms control negotiations between the two
superpowers, said a U.S. official who briefed reporters on the
visit.
   Shultz and De Mita met for an hour but there were no details
immediately available on their talk.
   Reagan and De Mita were expected to discuss the agenda of the
seven-nation summit, which brings together the heads of the world's
major industrialized countries for three days of talks beginning
Sunday in Toronto, Canada.
   The topics of discussion at the informal get-together in Toronto
are still being worked out and the United States would like to hear
Italy's views, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   De Mita, who took office in April at the head of Italy's 48th
government since World War II, also was to meet with Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, and House and Senate leaders.
   Shultz and De Mita had been expected to discuss Italy's
agreement in principle to take in the 72 F-16 fighter jets of the
401st Tactical Fighter Wing which Spain is evicting from the
Torrejon air base near Madrid.
   Italy's lower house of parliament is scheduled to vote on the
matter Thursday or Friday, and then the Italian Senate must give
its approval.
   Once parliamentary approval is given, NATO experts will meet to
determine where to deploy the planes, the official said.
   The official indicated that a new facility may have to be built
to accommodate the 401st, but said no decision had been made.
   Shultz also had been expected to brief De Mita on the secretary
of state's shuttle last week to the Middle East, where he tried in
vain to persuade Israeli and Arab leaders to negotiate peace.
   ``Italy as a Mediterranean state has a view of the Middle East
and of the region which it believes is unique,'' said the official.
``They have different views,'' the official conceded, ``but we've
always wanted to listen to them.''
   Italy believes Israel and its Arab neighbors should meet under
international auspices to negotiate an agreement under which Israel
would give back all the lands it captured in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   The United States favors a return of some lands to be worked out
in direct Arab-Israeli talks, without external interference.
   De Mita, who heads the Christian Democratic Party, took office
on April 13 after a month-long political crisis caused by the
resignation of his predecessor Giovanni Goria who served for only
seven months.

   There were few surprises in last weekend's
movie box office ratings as ``Crocodile' Dundee II'' remained in
first place for the third straight week despite stiffening
competition from the second-place comedy ``Big.''
   In third place was the debut Disney comedy ``Big Business,''
starring Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin in dual roles as two sets of
twins.
   ``The Presidio,'' an action-adventure story starring Sean
Connery and Mark Harmon, was in fourth place for its debut, while
the third movie in the ``Poltergeist'' series captured fifth place.
   ``Rambo III,'' fell to sixth place after a 44 percent drop in
business, and the George Lucas-produced ``Willow'' was in eighth
place.
   The second ```Crocodile' Dundee'' film starring Paul Hogan
earned $8.5 million over the weekend, while ``Big,'' starring Tom
Hanks as a 12-year-old boy who gets his wish to be a grown-up, sold
$7.9 million worth of tickets.
   The combination of Miss Midler and Miss Tomlin drew $6.1 million
in ticket sales for ``Big Business.''
   ``The Presidio'' attracted $5.1 million for its debut week.
   ``Poltergeist III,'' earned $4.3 million for its debut week.
   ``Rambo III'' had ticket sales of $4.2 million over the weekend,
down from the previous weekend's $7.69 million.
   Chevy Chase's ``Funny Farm,'' about a sportswriter's life in the
country, was in seventh place with more than $4 million in business.
   Ninth and 10th place were held by two holdovers,
``Beetlejuice,'' with $1.1 million and ``Colors,'' with $991,150.

   America's largest Presbyterian group urged
Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
calling its response to the Palestinian uprising ``heavy-handed,''
and today was considering its policy on U.S. anti-nuclear dissent.
   The 200th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
also was to select a top denominational officer in an election
today taking precedence over other business facing the 630
delegates.
   The assembly on Monday approved 494-67 its statement calling on
Israel to end its occupation of the territories seized during the
Six-Day War of 1967.
   The statement from the 3 million-member Protestant denomination
said Israel's ``heavy-handed crackdown'' during the 6-month-old
Palestinian uprising ``portends what lies ahead unless a political
settlement is reached.''
   It asked Israel to ``cease the systemic violation of human
rights of Palestinians,'' such as beatings, and food and fuel
embargoes.
   The denomination urged Israel to suspend settlement programs in
the occupied territories, ``since these simply provoke the Arab
peoples and reduce the opportunity for a peaceful resolution of the
conflicting claims of Israelis and Palestinians.''
   It also:
   _ Called on Palestinians and their leaders to try to control
violence to ease the peace process.
   _ Asked the United States to ``discourage retaliation as a
counter-terror strategy in the Middle East and to address the
injustices which are among the root causes of terrorism.''
   The statement urged the United States to insist that weapons
supplied for Israel's defense not be used against civilians in the
occupied territories or in ``aggressive attacks or disproportionate
retaliation upon other countries.''
   _ Asked all parties to participate in a United Nations-sponsored
international peace conference.
   Today, the assembly was to begin discussing its statement on
``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age.''
   The statement, which stemmed from a request five years ago by
local Presbyterian groups for guidance on how to respond to tax
resisters, was revised in lengthy meetings at the assembly by three
committees.
   The recommendations were edited to make it clear that while tax
resistance and other acts of civil disobedience could be justified,
Christians normally are expected to obey civil authorities.
   The statement was edited in an effort to remove any doubt that
disobedience is not a normal course. A section was added saying
military service could be an appropriate response to a Christian's
conscience.
   The committees reworded discussion of nuclear deterrence, but
left alone the declaration that nuclear war itself is immoral.
   The original paper said nuclear deterrence assumes the
willingness to use such weapons and is therefore immoral, although
it said unilateral disarmament is not yet feasible.
   The final recommended statement said ``nuclear deterrence has
been in danger of being regarded as an adequate and permanent means
to national security rather an interim measure of self-defense.
Such a policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible.''
   The Presbyterians also were to elect the stated clerk, who is
the officer responsible for overseeing the assembly's operation.
   On Saturday, a committee said it would nominate Harriet Nelson,
a lay leader from California, surprising many who expected the
panel to nominate two people, including the Rev. James E. Andrews.
   Andrews, interim co-stated clerk or stated clerk since the
denomination was formed in 1973 from the merger of the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.) and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), has said he
will be nominated from the floor.

   The Foreign Press Association of Israel on
Tuesday protested about 150 incidents of brutality against
journalists by police and soldiers.
   The 200-member association issued the statement at a news
conference and focused on an incident in which police beat up two
foreign photograpers at a demonstration in Tel Aviv this month. The
beating was witnessed by other photographers.
   ``We demand that the ministry of police investigate and punish
those who took part in that incident,'' said Robert Slater, the
chairman of the press association. ``We deplore the statements by
public officials that have created an odious public atmosphere.''
   All the incidents protested occurred in the past six months.
   Slater, a correspondent for Time magazine, said government
officials had made repeated statements indicating that the foreign
press fanned the flames of the Arab uprising, which began Dec. 8.
   He said such statements ``left in the minds of the public the
idea that we have orchestrated events, paid kids to throw stones
... and this has encouraged 19- and 20-year-old soldiers to do
their thing as they see fit.''
   In the June 4 Tel Aviv incident, photographers Sven Nackstrand
of Agence France Press and Andre Brutmann of Alfa Press were beaten
by plainclothes and uniformed police while they photographed a
demonstration against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   ``I was hit in all directions and struck to the ground. I
received five or six hard hits on the head, and one felt like an
explosion,'' Nackstrand told reporters.
   Nackstrand, who has worked seven years in Israel, said he was
then thrown near a police van and a few minutes later pulled into
the van. He was held in the van for about 10 minutes until a senior
officer, apparently realizing he was a journalist, ordered him
released.
   Slater said the Police Ministry didn't answer a cable sent a
week ago protesting the incident.
   Police Ministry spokeswoman Mira Firestein said her office
received the cable and asked police in Tel Aviv to investigate and
was still awaiting a reply.

   Lightning struck a hydrogen storage tank
at a uranium enrichment plant in southeastern France and started a
fire, but firefighters put out the blaze and there was no threat to
people nearby, authorities said Tuesday.
   The tank was hit by lightning at 9:30 p.m. Monday during a
storm. It is about 500 yards from the main plant. About 30
firefighters were called to ensure that the fire did not spread to
other tanks.
   Philippe Baudoin, director of the plant, said there was no
threat to the environment or to people in the vicinity.
   The Franco-Belgian plant at Romans, 350 miles southeast of
Paris, enriches 800 tons of uranium a year for use in
pressurized-water nuclear reactors.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission warned
Tuesday that a half-million Black & Decker weed trimmers that could
pose an electrocution hazard remain in consumer hands, despite an
earlier recall.
   The safety agency said it issued the new warning because of a
lower than expected return rate for the trimmers.
   Involved are Black & Decker Model 82209 and Model 82210
bump-feed string trimmers used on grass and weeds.
   Because of an error in wiring, the electrical wires in some of
the trimmers could be cut by the handle tube, causing a potential
for electrical shock, the agency said. Four cases have been
reported in which users were injured, the commission said.
   The trimmers were sold for $24 to $29 starting in 1985. Owners
should stop using the trimmers immediately and take them to a Black
& Decker service center for repair or replacement.
   People needing more information can contact Black & Decker at
1-800-533-4395 or the Safety Commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<TEXT>
   Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Albert Gore
Jr., D-Tenn., proposed legislation Tuesday that would require the
Consumer Product Safety Commission to ban the sale of three-wheeled
all-terrrain vehicles and establishing a procedure for owners to
obtain refunds.
   ``Consumers who bought ATVs not knowing their inherent dangers
deserve a refund,'' D'Amato said at a news conference. ``The surest
way to limit ATV-related deaths and injuries is to get these
machines out of the hands of our children.''
   Gore said the off-road sports vehicles have been linked to
nearly 1,000 deaths and more than 350,000 injuries requiring
medical treatment since 1982.
   ``Tragically, children are often the victims of ATV accidents,''
he said. ``In fact, nearly one-half of the injuries and deaths have
been caused to children under the age of 16.''
   The legislation would require the CPSC to:
   _Issue a rule within 60 days of the bill's passage banning the
sale of all three-wheeled ATVs;
   _Issue a rule within 120 days under which refunds would be
available to purchasers of three-wheeled ATVs or those who bought
them for children under 16;
   _Create a rule within 120 days requiring ATV distributors to
provide hands-on training to owners of the vehicles and members of
their immediate families;
   _Within a year, establish performance standards and design
characteristics to make ATVs safer, including age requirements for
the safe operation of ATVs.
   Of the 2.5 million ATVs now in use, about two-thirds are
three-wheeled models. The rest have four wheels.
   ``The Consumer Product Safety Commission has not done an
adequate job in protecting the consumer from the inherent risks and
dangers associated with ATVs,'' D'Amato said. ``It is time for
Congress to force their hand in this matter.''
   Commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon said in a statement that
Congress had the right to consider such legislation, but he argued
that a consent decree signed in April with the industry ``should be
given adequate time to provide the necessary protection for ATV
users and their families.''
   The decree between the CPSC and five ATV manufacturers banned
the sale of three-wheeled ATVs unless the manufacturers can devise
performance standards that are approved by the commission.
   The decree also requires that warning labels be placed on
four-wheeled models and that distributors provide training in the
safe use of all types of ATVs to people who purchased the vehicles
after Dec. 30, 1986.
   Also, the decree requires manufacturers to spend $8.5 million to
warn consumers about the hazards of ATVs and to promote training.
   CSPC Commissioner Anne Graham had voted against the consent
decree because it lacked a recall provision. Carol Dawson, the
third member of the commission, voted for it but said consumers
deserved the right to a reasonable refund if they so desired.
   The D'Amato-Gore bill requires the CPSC to establish the dollar
amount of any refunds, based on the age and condition of the ATVs.

   Montgomery County residents upset
about a tax increase know where to gripe, thanks to a sign posted
in a county office listing the home telephone number of four
tax-raising supervisors.
   Treasurer Ellis Meredith posted the sign to ward off complaints.
   ``I have had an enormous number of people who come into the
office, and they direct their complaints to me as if I'm the one
who raises taxes,'' Meredith said.
   Ellis says the sign is just a source of information, but the
supervisors see it another way.
   Supervisor Todd Solberg blasted the sign as ``a misuse of a
courthouse facility, while Supervisor Ann Hess called it ``terribly
unprofessional.''
   Ms. Hess said she received calls from people who objected to the
sign, but none from tax opponents.
   Earlier this year, the supervisors voted 4-3 to approve a 16.7
percent property tax increase in this southeastern Virginia county.
   Meredith, who had opposed the increase, defended the sign.
   ``If they vote to raise taxes, then they ought to be man or
woman enough to stand up outside the board meeting and say, `I was
responsible for it,''' Meredith said.

   It was a meeting made in heaven, but the
marriage was all wet.
   Jay Adams met Cynthia Baltzelle packing parachutes for a U.S.
Army Reserve unit in Seattle. They were married Saturday under 30
feet of water.
   More than 50 guests gathered around a TV monitor on Harper Dock,
across Pugent Sound from Seattle, to watch the videotaped ceremony
and listen via an underwater sound system.
   The couple was radiant in their blue wet suits. They wore their
wedding bands on bracelets outside of their diving mittens, and
exchanged them after they surfaced.
   When it came time to kiss, they rubbed faceplates.
   The bride, a plant worker, and the groom, a truck driver,
planned a diving honeymoon in the Caribbean.

<HEAD>Senators Try to Craft Bill Acceptable to Administration</HEAD>

   Senators worked Tuesday to craft a
welfare-overhaul bill acceptable to the Reagan administration but
said they would move ahead with the landmark, work-oriented measure
if no compromise could be reached.
   ``We're either going to wind it up ... or go out there (on the
floor) and start battling it out,'' said Republican Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas.
   ``It's not very clear what will satisfy the administration, and
that makes it very difficult,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., author and chief sponsor
of the five-year, $2.6 billion Family Security Act, said
closed-door negotiations on his popular bill would go on all day
and possibly into Wednesday.
   Asked if the administration appeared to want a welfare bill, he
replied, ``I think they don't want to veto a bill.''
   Aides have said President Reagan will do just that if senators
do not agree to demands that include broader state flexibility to
experiment with demonstration projects and a guaranteed rate of
welfare recipient participation in broad new education, training
and employment programs.
   Moynihan's bill would require states to institute new work and
training programs and enroll as many welfare parents as they could
afford, with special emphasis on teen-age mothers and others who
are or are likely to be long-term recipients.
   As part of its emphasis on parental responsibility, the bill
also requires extensive state efforts to determine paternity and
automatic wage withholding immediately upon the awarding of child
support.
   Moynihan's bill has 64 sponsors in the 100-member Senate, and an
aide said two additional senators support it. Before going to the
White House, it would have to be reconciled with a similar but much
more expensive House bill passed last December. It is unclear
whether either the Senate or the House could muster the two-thirds
majority needed to override a presidential veto.
   Moynihan has been fighting mandatory participation rates on
behalf of the nation's governors, who fear that with their limited
resources, they would have to provide cursory services to the least
needy people in order to meet the required level.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said senators were discussing a
mandatory 10 percent or 15 percent participation rate, rising
eventually to 25 percent. The administration wanted to go higher
than that, he said.
   Senators said Monday that the administration was seeking a
universal, mandatory and expensive workfare program, but the issue
appeared to have evaporated by Tuesday.
   ``That's not even under discussion,'' Moynihan said.
   ``There will not be a compulsory (work) requirement from the
federal level,'' Packwood said. ``The states will have a lot of
options.''
   Moynihan also said the administration was no longer fighting a
new requirement that states make welfare benefits available to
two-parent families at least six months in a year. Twenty-six
states already provide year-round coverage.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Product Liability Bill Opposed by Consumerists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee
approved a controversial product liability bill Tuesday that
consumer activists immediately denounced as a pro-business assault
on the legal rights of victims of hazardous products.
   The bipartisan compromise, which is given virtually no chance of
passing Congress this year, would establish uniform federal
liability standards for lawsuits over defective consumer goods.
Conflicting but generally stronger state laws would be pre-empted.
   Business lobbyists said a federal law would ease the growing
burden of liability insurance costs and result in lower consumer
prices. Consumer groups said the bill would make it harder for
victims to recover damages from manufacturers of unsafe products.
   The bill, described by Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., as ``complex
and politically charged,'' was approved 30-12 with the unanimous
support of the committee's 17 Republicans and a bare 13-member
majority of its 25 Democrats.
   It was the first time a product liability bill had ever cleared
a House committee. A similar measure died on the Senate floor in
late 1986 after a filibuster led by Ernest B. Hollings, D-S.C., an
adamant foe of such legislation.
   The House measure now heads for further study by an unfriendly
Judiciary Committee, which shares jurisdiction and traditionally
has favored trial lawyers in their opposition to such bills.
   ``We are getting ready for a fight in Judiciary,'' said Rep.
Mike Synar, D-Okla., who had won the Energy and Commerce panel's
approval of several pro-consumer amendments during more than a
month of wrangling over the bill.
   Consumer lobbyists lost no time castigating the bill and its
supporters.
   ``Since 1981, American industry has been battering away at
Congress, trying to get a pre-emptive federal product liability law
passed that would give manufacturers and sellers greater
opportunity to place dangerous products on the market with
diminished liability to the people they injure,'' said Joan
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen.
   ``Today a majority of the committee brought that consumer
nightmare a little closer to reality,'' she said.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said the committee had sided with
``toxic chemical producers, dangerously defective product
manufacturers and other promoters of corporate violence.''
   Alexander B. Trowbridge, president of the National Association
of Manufacturers, said the bill provides a ``fair and responsible''
overhaul of product liability laws. He said it would ``help curb
the number of unwarranted lawsuits,'' stimulate the economy and
reduce consumer prices.
   ``Everyone _ except the nation's trial lawyers _ wins under this
bill,'' Trowbridge said.
   A major feature protested by consumer advocates is the ``state
of the art'' defense made available to manufacturers under the bill.
   That provision says manufacturers can escape liability for
damages if they can prove they did not know _ or could not know _
of a design defect with knowledge ``reasonably available to
experts,'' or if there was no feasible alternative design.
   Synar won approval of an amendment putting the burden of proof
on the manufacturer rather than the consumer. The committee also
accepted a pro-consumer ``escape hatch'' sponsored by Synar that
would require plaintiffs to prove only that the product was so
unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should not have been
marketed.
   Another Synar provision would ease the standard of proof that
plaintiffs must meet in suing manufacturers. But consumer interests
are unhappy over his proposal to give a judge rather than a trial
jury the responsibility for deciding whether a product should have
been barred from the market because of safety hazards.
   Critics say the bill's provision for a state-of-the-art defense,
currently available to manufacturers in only eight states, would
undermine the legal doctrine of ``strict liability'' used in 47
states and favored by consumer interests.
   That doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the
manufacturer's alleged misconduct to the defective product itself,
relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or
should have known about a product's defects.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of West Germans,
including the foreign minister, are rallying behind a Hamburg man
who lost a court battle to keep two decorative gnomes in his front
yard.
   A Hamburg court last week ordered Adolf Besserdich to remove the
colorful plastic miniatures from the garden in front of his
apartment house after a neighbor complained that they were an
eyesore.
   Since the widely-publicized order, Besserdich has received
thousands of letters of support, many of them urging him to appeal
the decision, according to newspaper reports.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also
recently expressed his fondness for the bearded garden creatures.
   ``There's no doubt that these are kitsch,'' said Georg Koelsch,
director-designate of the Folkwang Museum in the central city of
Essen.``But the line between what we call art and what's kitsch is
narrow.''
   ``If you are not tolerant, you can't appreciate or understand
art,'' Koelsch added.
   Besserdich has moved his gnomes from the garden to his window
ledge.

<HEAD>Former Candidates McGovern, Goldwater Urge Israel To Deal With
Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential candidates George McGovern
and Barry Goldwater, usually on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, joined Tuesday in urging Israel to recognize the
``national legitimacy'' of Arab Palestinians and turn over
territory to them in exchange for peace.
   Their proposal differs from the plan unsuccessfully pursued by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz in that it would bypass Jordan,
which controlled the West Bank for l9 years, and strongly implies _
but does not specifically recommend _ creation of a Palestinian
state.
   McGovern, the losing Democratic standard bearer in 1972, was
explicit in an interview, however, that Israel should deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization with the purpose of establishing
a Palestinian state on the West Bank.
   Beside McGovern and Goldwater, who was the losing Republican
presidential candidate in 1964, those endorsing the proposal were
former Undersecretary of State George W. Ball, former World Jewish
Congress President Philip W. Klutznick, and three former European
government heads _ Garrett Fitzgerald of Ireland, Anker Jorgensen
of Denmark and Bruno Kreisky of Austria.
   ``We support the continued independence and security of the
state of Israel,'' the statement said. ``We equally affirm the
right of self-determination and security for the Palestinian
people. We believe that mutual recognition and good-faith
negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians can achieve a just
settlement...''
   Israel would yield all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
which it has held since 1967, to form a homeland for the
Palestinians in return for the Arab world's acceptance.
   The negotiations, the statement said, should be ``based on
mutual recognition of national legitimacy and the exchange of
territory for peace. The bloody violence and loss of life in the
disputed territory underscores the urgency of constructive
negotiations.''
   Shultz returned last week from the Middle East where he was
unable to persuade Israel and Jordan to enter negotiations.
Jordan's King Hussein demanded assurances that Israel would yield
the West Bank, which Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused
to provide.
   In ruling out PLO participation, Shultz said Yasser Arafat's
organization, which has carried out a number of terrorist assaults
on Israelis and Americans, must recognize Israel's right to exist
first. His plan called for including Palestinians in a joint
delegation with Jordan.
   Asked about bypassing Jordan, McGovern said ``I think we've got
to get around it. The government of Israel has to negotiate with
the PLO. The PLO has said it's willing to be part of an all-Arab
delegation. That would be fine with me. It's a matter of the
Palestinians determining who is to speak for them.''
   McGovern said the PLO was the only organization capable of
speaking for Arab Palestinians and the only one ``that could
enforce what's agreed on.''

<HEAD>Record Highs In Northeast, Showers In Central States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures soared to record highs again Tuesday over the
northeastern quarter of the nation, and drought-plagued North
Dakota got cool temperatures and rain.
   Temperatures neared 100 degrees at Newark, N.J., and dozens of
other cities reached the middle 90s.
   The high of 93 at Pittsburgh tied a record that has been on the
books since 1885, and the high of 94 at Traverse City, Mich.,
toppled a record set in 1897. Marquette, Mich., had its fourth
consecutive day of record heat with a high of 89.
   Other record highs were 95 at Allentown, Pa.; 98 at Alpena,
Mich.; 96 at Baltimore; 84 at Beckley, W.Va.; 91 at Binghamton,
N.Y.; 93 at Bridgeport, Conn.; 94 at Burlington, Vt.; 94 at
Cleveland, tie; 93 at Columbus, Ohio; 95 at Detroit; 96 at Fort
Wayne, Ind.; 88 at Muskegon, Mich.; 99 at Newark, tie; 96 at
Philadelphia; 84 at Portland, Maine, tie; 93 at Providence, R.I.;
93 at Rochester, N.Y., and 95 at Syracuse, N.Y.
   On the same date one year earlier, 32 cities in the central part
of the nation reported record highs.
   Showers fell over the Texas coastal areas and from the Dakotas
across Kansas to western Texas.
   North Dakota, where some fields have been so dry seeds wouldn't
germinate, afternoon temperatures were only in the 50s and 60s with
rain throughout most of the state. Minot got almost an inch of rain.
   Thunderstorms were expected from the upper Mississippi Valley
across sections of the central Plains to western Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Dickinson and Minot, N.D., to 102 at Needles, Calif. The
low for the day was 28 degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.,
and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from Michigan across the middle Mississippi Valley, Kansas and
western sections of the southern Plains to the mountains of
Colorado, and over southern Texas and across the Florida Peninsula.
Showers were forecast over the Washington coast, with widely
scattered thunderstorms in the mountains of the Northwest and in
sections of New England.
   Highs in the 60s or 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast;
in the 70s from northern Michigan across Minnesota and the Dakotas
to western sections of the central Plains; near 100 over
California's interior valleys and near Texas' Rio Grande Valley;
near 108 in sections of the desert Southwest; and in the 80s to mid
90s over most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Former HHS Official Wins Stay Of Restitution Order</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Department of Health and Human
Services official convicted of improperly taking $33,540 from a
private foundation won a stay Tuesday of an order that he make
restitution of more than $12,000.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell issued the stay while C.
McClain Haddow appeals the judge's order that he make restitution
and pay a $15,000 fine.
   Gesell partially stayed the fine, saying Haddow could make
monthly payments into an escrow account while the matter is
reviewed by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here.
   Haddow, who was chief of staff to former HHS Secretary Margaret
Heckler, pleaded guilty last year to two conflict-of-interest
violations for improperly arranging to receive $33,540 from a
private foundation and $21,790 in proceeds for government contracts
to write speeches for Mrs. Heckler.
   He served a 90-day prison term and is now appealing the fine as
well as Gesell's order that he pay the foundation $8,500 and the
government $3,540 as partial restitution.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo, about to turn 56, joked
Tuesday that his wife is so angry at him over attempts to cut
funding for a state council she runs that she's threatened not to
buy him a birthday present.
   Cuomo, facing a potential $900 million budget deficit, has
proposed cutting all sorts of spending for the current fiscal year,
including $500,000 of the $4 million budget for the Council on
Children and Families.
   ``She was very unhappy, but businesslike,'' Cuomo said. ``She
said, `Why did you do it to me?' I said, `We didn't do it to you.'''
   Cuomo said he then offered Matilda Cuomo the same deal he made
to his cabinet members and other state agency heads facing possible
budget cuts.
   ``I said, `If you can find a better cut, we'll consider it,'''
he explained. ``She said, `Good, we'll start with your birthday
present.'''
   Cuomo's birthday is Wednesday.

   One of the last members of the Shakers,
a 200-year-old denomination devoted to peace and communal living,
was remembered Tuesday as a woman whose grace, kindness and wit
touched hundreds of people.
   ``Here was someone who was very happy with her life and who
shared that with everybody,'' said Dan Eastman. ``She was the most
kind and generous person I ever knew.''
   Eldress Gertude Soule died Saturday in her sleep at age 93,
leaving just two elderly Shaker women at this hilltop community
that once was home to 400. The religion that once numbered 6,000
members has dwindled to fewer than a dozen.
   ``I think she'll always be here in her spiritual presence and in
memory,'' said Darryl Thompson, whose father is the historical
director of the Canterbury Shaker Village and whose first baby
clothes were made by Eldress Soule. ``The challenge for us will be
to keep that living sense of presence alive and pass on the
heritage.''
   Because they were celibate, Shakers maintained their numbers
through converts and orphans, like Eldress Soule who went to the
Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, at age 11 after her
mother died. At 21, she decided to stay on and took her vows.
   About 150 people packed the tiny Dwelling House Chapel and more
than 50 stood outside for the 90-minute funeral in temperatures
that approached 90 degrees in cloudless sunshine.
   Eldress Bertha Lindsay, 90, and Sister Ethel Hudson, 92, who
live at the village, wore traditional Shaker dress and sat side by
side, standing to sing Shaker hymns during the service. Other
Shakers from Sabbathday Lake, the only other surviving Shaker
community, also attended.
   Eldress Soule was buried at a cemetery enclosed by stone and
iron fences, where a single granite stone is marked ``Shakers.''
Village residents' names were listed in books and records, but they
share the common gravestone in death as they shared all their
possessions in life.
   Those who wished to ``give testimony'' about Eldress Soule
described her as a woman who loved children, nature and her life in
the village of white clapboard buildings atop a hill surrounded by
fields.
   ``The day she died I went to all the places we used to spend
time and she was there in every place,'' Darryl Thompson said.
``She saw God in every flower.''
   Jim Hansen of New Boston described how he came to know Eldress
Soule three years ago after visiting for a traditional Shaker
dinner, offered when the village is open as a museum to visitors.
   ``Believe it or not, Eldress Soule last fall said she always
wanted to learn how to shoot a gun,'' Hansen said. He said he got a
.22-caliber rifle and she got a tin can, donned her bonnet and cape
and they went behind her house. She wanted to put the can on a
100-year-old Shaker fence, Hansen said.
   ``I said `No, you might shoot the fence,''' he said. ``She said
`I'm not going to shoot the fence, I'm going to shoot the can.'''
   ``I'd like to report the Shakers are excellent marksmen. She hit
two out of four shots dead center,'' Hansen said. ``I'm going to
miss her.''
   Richard Morse, the Shakers' lawyer, also remembered Eldress
Soule's sense of humor and her courage.
   ``Here was a lady who stood fast for what she believed in and
always did it with the most pleasant way about her,'' Morse said.
   The Shakers lived simply, farming and producing tools such as
the clothespin and flat broom. They were pacifists and believed all
people were equal.
   Originating in the 1770s in England, the Shaking Quakers grew
under the leadership of ``Mother'' Ann Lee, who moved to New York
in 1774 with eight followers. Formally named the United Society of
the Believers in Christ's Second Coming, they gained their nickname
from emotional trembling in their religious services.

<HEAD>Government Hurries to Ease Tax Burden on Independent Enterprises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is moving quickly to lower taxes
for cooperative ventures before a new law enters force July 1, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said Tuesday.
   The new measure broadens the rights of the thousands of
independent enterprises that are key to Kremlin leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's reform movement.
   The announcement was a victory for those supporting Gorbachev's
efforts to reform the Soviet economy and to provide a better
quality and selection of consumer goods and services.
   Last month the Supreme Soviet, the nominal national parliament,
passed a law ensuring that cooperatives, owned by their members
rather than the state, can compete on an equal footing with
state-run businesses.
   It allows cooperatives to earn hard currency, prohibits
government interference in their business and bars the state from
taking them over.
   But it would have left in place a new tax ladder set up by the
Finance Ministry forcing cooperatives to pay the state up to 90
percent of profits.
   Supreme Soviet deputies called for a change, complaining that
the taxes would strangle the cooperatives.
   A leading reform advocate, economist Nikolai Shmelev, had told a
news conference rewriting the tax law might take as long as a year.
   But Tass said government experts will have the new tax law ready
in weeks.
   ``Significant changes are expected to be made to the decree,''
Tass said. ``They say, in particular, that progressive taxes on
co-ops will be reduced to 60 percent and even possibly 50 percent
from the current 90.''
   ``Members of the co-ops most needed by society, for example
building ones, as well as cooperatives selling their products at
state prices, will most likely be exempted from progressive
taxation altogether.''

   Democrats are planning to use computers to
tally some of the votes at the party's nominating convention next
month, but officials say the high-tech addition won't upstage the
traditional high point of the convention _ the state-by-state roll
call.
   The party's convention committee is working out the bugs in an
electronic voting system that will allow delegations, using small
computers on the floor, to vote on the party platform and
convention rules. Votes would be displayed on a big overhead screen
behind the podium.
   ``But we will still do the roll call for the president and vice
president in the traditional manner,'' said Ruth Berry, a
spokeswoman for the committee that is planning the July 18-21
convention in Atlanta.
   The state-by-state roll call, in which the head of each
delegation takes the floor to announce the state's votes, ``is a
long-standing tradition,'' she said. ``It's something people expect
and it adds excitement to the convention.''
   Several other high-tech features are being explored by the
convention committee, incuding the electronics to allow delegates
to send messages to other delegates on the floor, computer to
computer, she said.
   The committee also is talking to Southern Bell, which provides
local phone service in Atlanta, about televising convention
activities on closed-circuit, high-definition television monitors
around the convention center and in nearby VIP and hospitality
suites.
   High-definition TV, still in the experimental stage, is
considered the next generation in television, delivering clearer,
brighter images on a screen that is wider than conventional TV sets
and with the sound quality of a compact-disc recording.
   Southern Bell has found eight large-screen, Japanese-made
monitors it can use at the convention but is having trouble finding
more, said Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for BellSouth, the parent
corporation of Southern Bell. Few monitors are available because
the Japanese, leaders in HDTV development, plan to cover the Seoul
Olympics in high definition for a country-wide demonstration in
Japan this summer, he said.
   Southern Bell has put in a 1,063-mile fiber optic network to
handle about 9,000 convention telephone lines that will be used by
an estimated 16,000 reporters, editors and technicians and 14,000
delegates, party representatives and other convention participants.

<TEXT>
   Ball State University has offered to accept
a California college graduate who otherwise might have to return to
junior high school because he's only 11.
   Adragon E. DeMello of Santa Cruz, Calif., received his
bachelor's degree in mathematics last week from the University of
California at Santa Cruz. But he has been turned down by several
graduate scools because of his age, a Ball State official said
Tuesday.
   ``Universities talk about being accessible to all who are
qualified,'' said John Hill, assistant dean of the graduate college
at Ball State.
   ``This spring, we awarded a doctoral degree to a man who is 80
years old, so this young man would not be our first non-traditional
student.''
   Under California law, if DeMello is not accepted to a graduate
school, he must take the same classes as other 11-year-olds.
   The boy's father said he is considering moving abroad because of
that law, but did not say whether Ball State's offer would be
accepted.

   The judge who sentenced the
Sharpeville Six to hang said Monday he would not reopen their
murder trial, but he gave the convicts 35 days to appeal for
clemency from President P.W. Botha.
   Botha already has turned down such a request, despite
international appeals that he spare the lives of the five black men
and one woman convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black town
councilor.
   The campaign appeared to be resuming Monday. Neil Kinnock,
leader of Britain's opposition Labor Party, asked South Africa's
white authorities to stop the execution ``in the name of common
humanity and for the sake of preventing violence.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said:
``We continue to appeal for a humanitarian resolution of the
Sharpeville Six case whether it be clemency or the granting of a
new trial. We will be making our views known to the South African
government through diplomatic channels.''
   Judge Willem Human of the Pretoria Supreme Court, who presided
at the original trial in 1985, rejected an application by defense
lawyers that the case be reopened to consider allegations that
police coerced two state witnesses.
   Human said he had seen no affidavits from the witnesses saying
their testimony was false and said that even if they lied, there
was enough evidence for convictions.
   The councilor in the Sharpeville black township was stoned to
death and burned during riots provoked by a rent increase.
   None of the six was proved guilty of physical involvement in the
death of Khuzwayo Dlamini, but they were found guilty under the
principle that they participated actively in the crowd that
murdered him.
   The defendants are Mojalefa Sefatsa, Reid Mokoena, Oupa Diniso,
Duma Khumalo, Francis Mokhesi and Theresa Ramashamola, the only
woman on death row for what oppenents of the government call a
politically related crime.
   Their execution originally was scheduled for March 17 and Botha
resisted appeals for clemency from churches, human rights groups
and governments, including the United States, Britain and Japan.
   Judge Human granted a stay hours before the six were to hang,
agreeing to hear arguments that the trial should be reopened
because of the possibility that police coerced two prosecution
witnesses to give false testimony.
   Defense lawyers told Human in court Monday they did not have
affidavits from the witnesses. Human called their request for a new
trial ``frivolous and absurd.''
   He refused them permission to appeal and said they should have
taken their request to Botha. He stayed the executions for 35 more
days so the lawyers could take whatever further steps are possible.
   The lawyers said they would would petition P.J. Rabie, acting
chief justice, for permission to take Human's decision to the
Appeals Court he heads. That court, like the president, already has
refused to overturn Human's original decision and sentence.
   Several dozen friends, relatives and diplomats were in the
courtroom Monday. Thewy did not react immediately to the reading of
the decision, but some family members wept later when lawyer
Prakesh Diar explained it to them in the corridor. Relatives then
went to Pretoria prison to visit the six convicts.
   Diar agreed with a reporter that, although he will appeal to the
chief justice, the fate of the Sharpeville Six is in Botha's hands.
   ``I'm afraid to say, yes, that is so,'' he said. ``I hope and I
pray that the state president will reconsider his previous
decision. This is a politically related case. (Botha's decision)
may be based on political considerations.''
   He said he spoke with his clients last week and described them
as ``hopeful, but not confident.''
   Referring to the international campaign to save them, he said:
``Although they are in their cells alone, they are not alone
spiritually. They know the world is with them.''
   The government has contended the six have been unfairly
portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law.
   Authorities say evidence at the trial proved each played an
active part in the killing through such actions as making firebombs
to burn Dlamini's house and slapping a woman who pleaded for the
councilor's life.

<HEAD>Long Island County Enacts 1st Law To Regulate Terminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first law in the nation to regulate
use of computer terminals in the workplace was enacted Tuesday when
the Suffolk County Legislature overrode the county executive's veto.
   ``It is a happy day for Suffolk County's workforce,'' said
legislator John Foley, who introduced the bill.
   In six months, businesses with more than 20 visual display
terminals will have to provide special treatment for workers who
spend more than 26 hours a week in front of the computer screens:
   _The workers must have 15-minute breaks or a new work assignment
after three hours with a VDT.
   _The employer must pay 80 percent of the cost of annual eye
exams and any eyeglasses that are needed.
   In addition, any equipment purchased after next year must have
such features as non-glare screens, adjustable desks and
five-legged chairs.
   The bill was written in response to worker complaints of
eyestrain, muscle aches and other ill effects from long-term VDT
use.
   Subsequently, California researchers reported that a study found
that women who used VDTs for more than 20 hours a week during the
first three months of preganncy suffered twice the number of
miscarriages of women who rarely used terminals. But the
researchers said they could not determine whether the VDTs or some
other factor such as job stress caused the increased rate.
   County Executive Patrick Halpin vetoed the Suffolk measure on
Friday, saying it would drive businesses away from the eastern Long
Island county.
   ``The new law will cost Suffolk many good high tech jobs,'' he
predicted after Tuesday's vote.
   The 18-member Legislature discussed the bill for about an hour
before voting 13-5 _ one vote more than needed _ to override
Halpin's veto.
   ``The county executive heard what he wanted to hear from big
money, big business and fear,'' said Legislator Rose Caracappa.
   ``Opposition to this bill was based on overreaction,'' charged
legislator Gregory Blass. ``We've heard the doom and gloom from
business in the past,'' when bottle-deposit and anti-smoking bills
were enacted.
   Halpin said he would try ``to implement the law so it will have
minimal impact on the business community.''
   The County Health Department is responsible for enforcing the
new law.
   James LaRocca, president of the Long Island Association, a
business group, predicted the loss of more than 3,000 jobs in
pending expansion and relocation deals.
   Supporters of the bill were the Communications Workers of
America, Civil Service Employees Association, and various women's
groups.

<HEAD>Presidential Scholars Showing On Education Quiz Termed
`Respectable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What do presidential scholars know? Apparently
a good bit more than the typical 17-year-old.
   But a good many still were stumped by some questions on a
federal education officials' quiz on U.S. history and literature.
   Chester Finn Jr., the assistant secretary of education for
research and improvement, said Tuesday that the Presidential
Scholars who took the multiple-choice test answered an average of
86 percent of the questions correctly.
   That compared with a 48 percent score for 8,000 juniors who
answered the same questions in 1986 as part of a National
Assessment of Educational Progress test.
   Finn, who co-authored a book about the results called ``What Do
Our 17-year-olds Know?'' said it was a respectable showing.
   But many of the Presidential Scholars _ some of the nation's top
high school seniors being honored here this week in four days of
ceremonies and seminars _ missed some questions that Finn clearly
thought they should have known.
   Only 63 percent of the scholars picked ``Speak softly and carry
a big stick'' as the phrase that characterized U.S. foreign policy
during the early 1900s. Only 32 percent of the 17-year-olds tested
in 1986 got that right. The phrase is a quotation from President
Theodore Roosevelt.
   Only 48 percent picked Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor as
authors known for stories set in the South; the national average
was 14 percent.
   Fifty percent correctly picked Jane Addams as the founder of
settlement houses to help the urban poor; the national average was
41 percent.
   Fifty-one percent identified Richard Wright as the author of
``Native Son,'' a novel of black life in Chicago; the national
average was 32 percent.
   Finn said, ``A hundred and one of you had the courage to
actually take this test. This of course skews the results since the
20 or so of you who ducked it undoubtedly would have done worse on
it. You were not a representative sample even of yourselves.''
   At a session hosted by the Education Department for the
scholars, he called the 86 percent score ``pretty good,'' but not
cause for any swelled heads.
   Finn outlined Reagan administration critiques of American
schools and why it favors merit pay for teachers and other policies
to spur improvements.
   When John Kandara of Winston-Salem, N.C., asked about the
anxiety that teacher career ladder plans can cause, Finn replied,
``In most professions, competition is not considered a vice. Are
you familiar with the Olympics? Indeed, are you familiar with
Presidential Scholars?''
   ``American kids in general just don't go to school enough,''
said Finn, who said a teen magazine generated a flood of letters
criticizing him for a recent article in which he advocated
year-round schools.
   ``The most interesting about the letters was how many were
utterly incoherent,'' said Finn.
   Scott Murphy, a scholar from Columbia, Mo., asked how American
universities achieve world eminence ``with students who are so far
inferior?''
   Finn replied that the best American research universities are
second to none, but ``an awful lot of colleges are driven by the
dynamics of keeping their classes full.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Discloses Apology By Soviet Minister Over Shooting
Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three years after the fact, the Soviet Union's
highest-ranking military official has apologized for the 1985
shooting death of an American Army officer inside East Germany, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The apology was extended by Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov
to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci at a private meeting May 31
during the Moscow summit, said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief
spokesman.
   Yazov offered no new details or explanation for the March 24,
1985, shooting of Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr. by a Soviet soldier,
nor did he respond to previous U.S. demands for financial
compensation to Nicholson's family, Howard said.
   Nonetheless, ``we feel we have received the appropriate apology
from the Soviets, yes,'' the spokesman said. ``The request for, or
the demand for, an apology, we feel, has been responded to
appropriately by the minister.''
   Howard quoted Yazov as saying: ``I express my regret over the
incident and am sorry this occurred. This does not promote improved
relations. Secretary Carlucci and I have agreed we will do all we
can to prevent these kinds of incidents in the future.''
   Howard also said the two men had agreed during their Moscow
talks on ``the need to come up with some sort of regime that will
prevent these things from happening.''
   ``The two sides agreed to come up with a list of recent such
incidents, violations, whatever, and to meet again to try to work
out a set of ground rules,'' Howard said. ``That's where it stands
at the moment.''
   The Pentagon spokesman repeatedly described Yazov's apology as
appropriate or satisfactory, apparently trying to close out an
affair that had been seized upon by Carlucci's predecessor as a
stark example of Soviet inhumanity.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, much to the
occasional chagrin of State Department officials, never stopped
demanding an apology and compensation for Nicholson's death even as
overall East-West relations improved.
   Weinberger stepped down last November.
   Howard disclosed the Yazov apology during a regular Pentagon
briefing, the first to be held since Carlucci returned from an
around-the-world trip that included stops in Moscow, Japan and
South Korea.
   The spokesman said he did not disclose the apology at the close
of the summit meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev because no reporters asked about the matter.
   Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, who was Nicholson's commanding officer
at the time of his death, hailed Yazov's apology as long-awaited
vindication.
   ``It was a long time coming, but the Soviet military has made
the right decision,'' Lajoie said in a statement Tuesday.
   ``Their apology vindicates the position that the U.S. government
has constantly maintained on this tragic incident. I am personally
very pleased to hear the news, but more importantly, the Nicholson
family will be gratified at this development.''
   Lajoie was a colonel at the time of Nicholson's death. He is now
a one-star general in charge of the new On-Site Inspection Agency
that will oversee verification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces Treaty.
   Nicholson was shot and killed by a Soviet army sentry more than
three years ago while on what was supposed to be a routine
surveillance mission inside East Germany.
   The 37-year-old Nicholson, of West Redding, Conn., was a member
of the U.S. Military Liaison Mission, allowed under the terms of a
1947 treaty to keep tabs on Soviet military activities inside East
Germany.
   On the day he died, Nicholson and a driver, Sgt. Jessie G.
Schatz, were trying to observe a Soviet tank shed. According to the
U.S. account, Nicholson was close to _ but not in _ a restricted
area when a Soviet sentry suddenly opened fire without warning.
   The Pentagon has charged that Schatz was directly prevented from
going to the wounded man with his first aid kit and that the major
was left to die without medical attention. The Defense Department
also noted angrily at the time that Soviet military inspectors
working inside West Germany had never been threatened with being
shot.
   The Russians previously had countered that Nicholson was
improperly wearing a camouflaged uniform; had strayed into a
restricted area, and ignored several shouted warnings before the
sentry opened fire.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz lashed out
at Nicaraguan authorities on Tuesday, accusing them of reneging on
promises to create democracy and of subjecting Contra negotiators
to harassment and intimidation during talks last week.
   But Shultz, after a meeting with the Contra leadership, declined
to say whether the failure of the peace negotiations between the
leftist Sandinista government and the Contras means the
administration will seek military aid for the rebels.
   Meanwhile, Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann held the
Contras responsible for collapse of the peace talks, contending
they had made ``demands so outlandish and unacceptable'' that they
knew in advance the Sandinista negotiators would reject them.
   In a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, Tunnermann
said that on the last day of the talks, the Contras introduced ``an
entirely new set of demands'' and insisted that the government
accept all of them within two hours.
   ``They virtually presented my government with an ultimatum,''
Tunnermann said.
   Shultz, speaking with reporters, said that in Managua last week,
``the resistance delegation was harassed, initimidated and
subjected to continual abuse, treated virtually as prisoners,
refused permission to meet with democratic political leaders and
threatened with harm by Defense Minister Humberto Ortega if they
refused to sign an agreement.''
   Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra directorate, asked to
elaborate on Shultz's allegation, said Ortega at one point
threatened to deny the rebel delegation permission to leave Managua
if the talks broke down.
   ``About 20 minutes later, he (Ortega) said that once the war
started again, the bullets from the Sandinistas will not only be
against our combatants from the mountains but against the people
sitting across this table,'' Cesar said.
   Shultz, blaming the Sandinistas for the breakdown of the talks,
said their actions have shown the world ``that their promises of
democratization have no counterpart in concrete action.
   ``Their consistent and apparent goal has been to disarm and
eliminate the resistance so that they can proceed to consolidate
their rule in Nicaragua,'' Sultz said.
   ``Their kind of rule in Nicaragua will never be accepted as
legitimate by the United States. We will stick with the resistance
freedom fighters. Their cause of peace with freedom is the right
cause.''
   It was not clear what Shultz meant when he raised questions
about the legitimacy of the Sandinista government because the
United States has always been represented in Managua by an
ambassador since the start of the 1979 revolution.
   Shultz met with Cesar and two other members of the Contra
directorate on Tuesday along with the rebels' military commander,
Col. Enrique Bermudez, as part of an assessment of future options.
   The Contra leaders met into the dinner hour at the White House
with national security adviser Colin Powell. There was no immediate
indication of what transpired in that meeting.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., has recommended a $105 million package
of military and humanitarian aid for the Contras, and Contra leader
Adolfo Calero has indicated support for that proposal.
   The Contras have received no military aid since Feb. 29. But
Congress has approved assistance for the purchase of food, shelter,
medical supplies and clothing. The administration's last request
for military aid was rejected by the House on Feb. 3.
   The rebels will confer Wednesday with members of Congress about
possible future steps.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois said Contra aid
was discussed at a meeting of GOP congressional leaders with
President Reagan on Tuesday, but no decisions were reached.
   Michel said he expects a push for renewal of humanitarian aid.
Asked about the prospect of military aid, he said, ``I don't think,
quite frankly, there has been the kind of dramatic movement either
way that would indicate we would change any votes in Congress.''

<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee voted
Tuesday to let the next president decide whether to fund
construction of a space station.
   Under the bill approved by the committee, $387 million would be
available for research and development between Oct. 1, when the
next fiscal year begins, and April 15, when the next president
would have to decide whether to continue with the space station.
   Another $65.4 million would be held in an account, and should
the president decide not to proceed further, those funds would be
used to shut down the program.
   Additionally, $450 million would be held through April 15. If
the new president decided to continue with the program, the money
would go to the space station. If he decided against the space
station, $150 million would be transferred to Space Flight Control
and Data Communications at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. The remaining $300 million would be rescinded.
   Under the bill, the new president would have to let Congress
know between Feb. 1 and April 15 of his intentions to continue with
the space station.
   ``If it's (Democrat Michael) Dukakis, it could be the end of the
space station,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas. ``The guy is a
northern liberal. This is set up to pit domestic spending against
defense spending....
   DeLay, whose Houston-area district borders Johnson Space Center,
said about half of the station would be built in Houston.
   ``The Russians have already gotten their space station up,'' he
said. ``They're going to beat us on technology and industrial
development through a space station. The future is right there and
we're way behind.''
   He said construction of the space station could begin next year
if it stays on schedule. The original bill, before it was amended
Tuesday, called for a $902 million appropriation, which officials
said was just enough to keep the program on schedule.
   The space station is planned to be in orbit around Earth and
occupied by astronauts at the end of 1996. A year before that it
would be available for periodic visits by astronauts.

   An Arab-American deported from Israeli said
Tuesday that he would consider converting to Judaism, if necessary,
to return to Israel.
   Mubarak Awad, an advocate of non-violent Palestinian resistance,
was deported Monday by the Israeli government, which accused him of
subversion.
   Awad, a U.S. citizen who was born in Jerusalem and returned
there in 1983, said he might convert from Christianity to Judaism
and seek re-entry under Israel's Law of the Return ``if everything
(else) failed.''
   ``It's going to take a lot of guts to do it,'' Awad said at a
news conference. ``Maybe I have to do it.''
   ``I am here, but not by choice,'' he said. ``I was deported just
because I am a Christian. If I were a Jew, I would not be
deported.''
   Under the Law of the Return, any Jew can enter Israel. But the
privilege is not absolute; gangster Meyer Lansky, for example,
sought Israeli citizenship under the law in 1970, but was forced to
leave in 1972 following allegations of his continued involvement in
organized crime.
   Pressed on the subject of conversion, Awad said, ``I'll tell (a
rabbi) frankly ... it's not my belief. It's a political statement
that I'm persecuted because I'm a Christian.''
   Leaders of reform Judaism, meanwhile, issued a letter saying
that ``extraneous motivations, political motivations, are not
sufficient reason'' for conversion.
   ``No one can rule out the possibility of a sincere conversion in
anybody's case, but this must be proved at the end of a long period
of instruction,'' said a letter sent to 1,500 Reform rabbis in the
United States and Canada.
   But Awad said he would first pursue other avenues to return to
Israel, including appealing to international public opinion. He
said he planned meetings with officials at the United Nations, in
Washington, Europe and the Soviet Union.
   In ordering Awad deported, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
alleged that he played a key role in this year's Arab uprising in
the occupied territories.
   But Awad disclaimed any overriding influence among Palestinians,
saying ``Shamir, he's the one who made me a hero.''
   He defended his support of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, but said he did not support all the organization's
actions or policies. ``I condemn violence from the PLO, from
Israelis, from everybody,'' he said.
   Awad denied inciting violence against Israel but has supported
the uprising in the territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle
East war. Some tactics he has long advocated, such as tax boycotts
and commercial strikes, were adopted by leaders of the uprising.
   Awad is the 21st Arab to be expelled by Israel since the Dec. 8
start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. His expulsion was protested by the Reagan
administration.
   Awad was deported on the grounds that his three-month tourist
visa issued last August had expired. The Israelis refused to extend
the visa, and the Israeli Supreme Court last week rejected Awad's
appeal to stay.
   Awad, who lived in the United States for 13 years before
returning to Jerusalem in 1983, is the founder of the Palestinian
Center for the Study of Non-Violence in that city. He has lectured
on civil disobedience, counseled teachers against corporal
punishment and planted olive trees in West Bank villages to
underscore the Arabs' claim to the land.
   He lived in Wapakoneta, Ohio, where he still owns a home. His
wife, Nancy Nye, said she soon will be going to Jerusalem to teach.

   The army ordered West Bank schools closed for
two days, trying to head off student protests during a general
strike called for Wednesday by underground leaders of the
6-month-old Palestinian rebellion.
   Schools in the West Bank were closed for four months and
students held violent demonstrations after high schools reopened
this week. The two-day closing Wednesday and Thursday was intended
as a warning to students that they may be shut again if violence
continues.
   New army figures said dozens of Israeli soldiers have been
convicted of or charged with excessive use of force and other
violations of regulations since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The figures also showed the number of Arabs detained without
charges, which permits them to be held for up to six months,
increasing by one-fifth since May, to 2,500. Most are young
activists.
   Civil rights workers criticized Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
statement to the Cabinet this week that Israeli civilians who see
Arabs holding firebombs would be allowed to shoot them.
   ``This is giving the green light for shooting and killing
without justification,'' lawyer Amnon Zichroni said. ``This will
lead to counterattacks from Palestinians. It's a vicious cycle
without end.''
   At least 207 Palestinieguards our freedoms and underpins the development
of
the West.''
   ``The prospects for a lasting peace require us to prevent any
weakening of our Atlantic solidarity, to refrain from any actions
of unilateral disarmament,'' he said.
   De Mita said later at a news conference that a disagreement over
Middle East policy was aired during his talks with administration
officials.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is trying to arrange
negotiations between Israel and a delegation of Jordanians and
Palestinians. He has ruled out participation by the Palestine
Liberation Organization unless it accepts Israel's right to exist,
as well as creation of a Palestinian state.
   De Mita said he told the Americans that Italy continues to
believe the PLO is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people.
   One of the topics expected to arise at the Toronto summit is the
extent to which the industrialized democracies should help Eastern
European nations solve their economic problems.
   De Mita said he and the president agreed that massive aid for
these countries should be withheld as long as their economies are
predominantly state-managed.
   De Mita planned to meet on Wednesday with members of Congress
and Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci before making a private
visit to Bar Harbor, Maine.

<HEAD>Italian Monk Brings Petitions Asking Clemency for Murderer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A monk from Rome brought petitions here
Tuesday from nearly 2 million Italians seeking commutation of the
death penalty given to a teen-ager for the murder and robbery of a
Bible teacher.
   The Rev. Vito Bracone said he was disappointed that Gov. Robert
D. Orr, who had previous engagements, did not accept the petitions
in person. Instead, Bracone met with an aide to the governor and
with the convicted murderer, Paula R. Cooper, 18.
   The petition drive in Italy began in November 1986 to win
clemency for Cooper, of Gary, who was sentenced to die in Indiana's
electric chair for a 1985 robbery and stabbing.
   Pope John Paul II announced last September that he, too, would
like to see Cooper granted clemency.
   Orr, leaving his office to fulfill two speaking engagements,
said Bracone and the Amnesty International members accompanying the
Franciscan monk hadn't called to ask for a meeting.
   If they had, Orr said he's not sure he would have met with
Bracone because Cooper's appeal is pending.
   ``The issue is still before the judiciary,'' he said. ``Until
they've completed their work, I think it would be inappropriate for
me to get involved.''
   The governor has the authority to commute a sentence at any
time. But Orr has not yet received a direct commutation request
from Cooper's lawyers, who still have an appeal pending before the
state Supreme Court.
   Bracone, at a news conference outside the Statehouse, said he
only wanted a dialogue with the governor.
   ``I don't see why we cannot talk. I don't want to put any
pressure on him,'' said Bracone.
   Michael K. Sutherlin, a local Amnesty International spokesman,
said the group might try later to arrange to present the petitions
to Orr.
   He also pledged that the organization would try during the 1989
General Assembly to have the death penalty repealed. Amnesty
International believes the death penalty is a human rights
violation.
   Orr said he believes the death penalty still has broad public
support in Indiana.
   During the 1987 legislative session, Amnesty International and
other groups including the Indiana Catholic Conference lobbied
successfully for a bill to raise to 16 from 10 the minimum age of a
person who could be sentenced to death.
   The new law does not affect Cooper, who was 15 at the time of
the 1985 stabbing and robbery of Ruth E. Pelke, 78, of Gary. Three
other teen-agers were also convicted of related crimes in the
slaying, but none of the others was sentenced to die.
   Mrs. Pelke's grandson, William Pelke of Portage, has called for
Cooper to be granted clemency. He accompanied Bracone to the
Statehouse Tuesday.
   Bracone and the Rev. Justin Belitz, a Franciscan priest from
Indianapolis, met with Cooper at the Indiana Women's Prison in
Indianapolis. She told them she is taking college-level
correspondence courses from a Bible college in Fort Wayne and soon
will take courses from Indiana University.
   Cooper said she would like eventually to study psychology and
work with children.

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis maintained a double-digit lead over Republican George Bush
in a Gallup poll released Tuesday, a larger margin than his
advantage in two other recent public opinion surveys.
   The poll, conducted by Gallup for the Boston Globe and Boston
television stations WEEI and WCVB, found 52 percent support for
Dukakis and 38 percent for Bush. The same poll a month ago gave
Dukakis his greatest lead, 54-38.
   Another opinion poll in May gave Dukakis a double-digit lead, 10
points in a CBS News-New York Times survey. Two more recent polls
had single-digit leads for Dukakis, 49-44 in a Harris poll
conducted June 1-6 and 45-39 in a USA Today-CNN poll June 7-9.
   The new Gallup poll, conducted June 10-12 among 1,005 registered
voters, had a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.

<HEAD>Thousands of Latvians March in Memory of Those Deported by Soviets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people joined a march in the Latvian
capital of Riga Tuesday in memory of Latvians deported from the
republic when it was occupied by Soviet forces before and after
World War II, Tass reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said the march was sanctioned by
Soviet officials and ``many thousands'' of people participated.
   It reported Latvian historian Jan Riekstins addressed a rally
and quoted him as saying: ``We justifiably condemn the policy of
cruelty.''
   Last year a similar demonstration was allowed by Soviet
authorities without interference and Latvian activists said 5,000
people took part.
   The fact that this year's march was officially sanctioned
appeared linked to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
more open reporting of the wrongs conducted under the dictatorship
of Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.
   Latvian activists had said Tuesday's demonstration was called
``to prevent the return of Stalinist and neo-Stalinist crimes
against the people and in the further unwavering forward course of
M. Gorbachev's restructuring,'' according to Ojars Kalnins of the
World Federation of Free Latvians in Washington.
   Tass quoted Riga Mayor Alfred Rudiks as saying the government of
the republic had ``approved the initiative of young people to build
in Riga a monument to victims of Stalin's personality cult.''
   Official Soviet historians say 31,000 people were deported from
Lativa after it was occupied by the Soviet army in 1940 and in
1949. The last occupation came after Germany had been defeated and
the Soviets were in the process of annexing Latvia and the
neighboring Baltic republics of Lithuania and Estonia. Germany had
seized the republics during the war.
   Tass said many of the deportation victims were Nazi sympathizers.
   ``Apart from those who were deservedly punished for acts of
political sabotage, collaboration with fascists, banditism and
espionage, the deportees also included innocent people,'' the
agency said.
   It had harsh words for one of the march organizers, Edmund
Cirvilis, calling him ``a former Nazi soldier who was sent to
Latvia on a terrorist mission in 1945.''
   Repeated attempts to reach Latvian activists in Riga by
telephone were unsuccessful.
   There was no word on a demonstration planned Tuesday in
Lithuania. Various reports say 36,000 Lithuanians were deported in
1941 and 200,000 in 1948.
   Last month, Soviet police broke up a demonstration by 5,000
Lithuanians marking the anniversary of the 1949 deportations,
according to Lithuanian activists.
   The United States has never officially recognized the Soviet
claim to the Baltic republics.

<HEAD>Top Labor Official Quits Over Nuclear Weapons Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Labor Party official resigned Tuesday in
a dispute over whether the party should modify its controversial
pledge to abandon Britain's nuclear weapons and shut down U.S.
nuclear bases.
   Legislator Denzil Davies, the party's parliamentary spokesman on
defense, said the ``last straw'' was a recent statement by party
leader Neil Kinnock that Labor's unilateral nuclear disarmament
policy is outmoded.
   ``I am fed up with being humiliated by Mr. Kinnock,'' said
Davies, 49.
   ``He never consults me on anything ... I cannot get up in the
House of Commons and make a speech when Mr. Kinnock says all sorts
of things all over the place, one thing one day and another the
next _ and he is supposed to be the future prime minister.''
   Kinnock said he was amazed and sad that Davies, a fellow
Welshman and longtime senior figure in the opposition party, had
quit. Kinnock later named Martin O'Neill, a legislator since 1970,
to replace Davies.
   Davies' resignation, announced in statement, highlighted a
widening split as Kinnock pushes Labor back toward the center in
what he sees as the socialists' only hope of ousting Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the next election. It must be
held by 1992.
   Kinnock, 46, a lifelong anti-nuclear campaigner, angered Labor
left-wingers when he said in a June 5 television interview there
was ``no need now for something-for-nothing unilateralism'' because
the superpowers had broken the impasse by singing an accord
scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   ``We would be complete fools, whatever our politics, to ignore
the scope and scale of the change and the opportunities and
responsibilities that go with trying to be part of that change,''
Kinnock said of U.S.-Soviet agreements.
   Tony Benn, an ex-Cabinet minister and leading leftist who will
challenge Kinnock for the leadership at the party conference in the
fall, said Davies' resignation confirmed ``there is unhappiness
across the whole party about the way things are going.''
   The Conservatives were jubilant at the renewed public outbreak
of fighting among the Laborites over the anti-nuclear policy, which
polls show is a major vote-loser. ``The job of defense spokesman in
today's Labor Party is an impossible one,'' commented Mrs.
Thatcher's armed forces minister Ian Stewart.
   ``The choice is between a policy of unilateral disarmament,
which makes Labor unelectable, or a policy of realism, which is
unacceptable to large sections of the Labor Party,'' he said.
   Kinnock has denied dumping the non-nuclear pledge, which the
party first adopted as official policy in 1982, three years after
losing power to Mrs. Thatcher. But the June 5 interview was his
strongest indication that a Labor government would use Britain's
nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in arms control talks with the
Soviets, rather than simply scrap them on principle.
   The current policy calls also for closing U.S. nuclear bases in
Britain.
   In the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her
opposition to including Trident missiles in arms control talks,
noting it was the equivalent of three percent of the Soviet arsenal.
   ``There is no point ... in giving up 100 percent of our Trident
for the Soviet Union giving up 3 percent of her strategic
weapons,'' she said.
   Polls indicate that while a majority of Britons oppose having
U.S. nuclear weapons in this country, many also believe Britain
should remain a nuclear power.

   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker on
Tuesday became the latest Reagan administration official to
announce his resignation before the president's term expires in
January.
   Here is how the Cabinet and top adminstration posts have changed
since President Reagan took office in 1981:

Carlucci had been named to the post by Reagan on Dec. 2, 1986,
replacing John M. Poindexter, who resigned in the wake of the
Iran-Contra affair. Poindexter had taken over from Robert C.
McFarlane in December 1985. McFarlane had succeeded William P.
Clark in November 1983. Clark had replaced Richard V. Allen in 1982.
   SECRETARY OF STATE: George P. Shultz replaced Alexander M. Haig
Jr. in 1982 after Haig resigned.

   Michael Dukakis promised on Tuesday to replace
the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative with a
``Conventional Defense Initiative'' to help defend Europe against
Soviet attack.
   The all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee, in a major
defense and foreign policy speech, also said the federal budget
situation means it is time ``to make tough choices on defense.'' He
denied that he was tipping his hand to the Soviets by announcing
opposition to the MX and Midgetman missiles.
   Dukakis declared a strong commitment to NATO and outlined a
step-by-step plan for reducing the risk of war in Europe. In a
reference to the Soviet Union and its allies, he said that to
eliminate the possibility of a surprise attack ``we have to have
greater reductions from the side with the most forces, the Warsaw
Pact.''
   Vice President George Bush, for his part, denounced Dukakis as
``wrong, wrong'' for opposing SDI and the MX missile.
   ``He's wrong twice,'' the vice president told reporters in
Washington.
   On another foreign policy subject, Dukakis appeared
uncomfortable with his party's plan to label South Africa a
terrorist state in its platform, as his own representatives agreed
at a platform drafting session Sunday in Mackinac Island, Mich.
   ``I tend to resist labels generally because I don't know exactly
what they mean,'' said Dukakis.
   But Madeleine Albright, his foreign policy adviser, said later
that Dukakis was ``very comfortable'' with the evolving platform,
and ``there is absolutely no distancing himself from what was
said'' at the drafting session.
   In his speech at the State Department before a pro-NATO group
called the Atlantic Council, Dukakis said, ``We've got to be very
tough on South Africa. Constructive engagement's a failure. ...
South Africa is not only engaging in blatant racism against its own
people and in terrorist acts; it's committing naked military
agression against its neighbors all over southern Africa.''
   Dukakis also said that if President Reagan can achieve an
agreement with the Soviets on long-range missiles in the closing
months of 1988, ``I strongly urge the administration to go for it
and I hope they do.''
   He declared his commitment to ``a NATO so strong and so united
that no nation will be tempted to begin a war against us.'' But he
also said the European allies must bear a greater share of the
common defense burden.
   ``NATO has worked for 40 years. It can work for 40 more _ if our
allies do their share and if we stop trying to go it alone as we
have done too often during the past seven years,'' he said.
   ``We all know that the defense budget isn't going to increase in
real terms, unless an emergency arises, no matter who the next
president is, he said. ``The time has come to make tough choices on
defense.''
   ``We don't need SDI; we need CDI, the Conventional Defense
Initiative begun by leaders in the Congress to apply advanced
technology to the challenge of fighting and winning a conventional
war,'' he said. The Strategic Defense Initiative is the
administration's proposed space-based missile-defense system, still
in the research stage.
   ``We don't need MX missiles running around on railroad cars. We
need an anti-tank weapon that can stop Soviet tanks.''
   Asked why he would announce in advance that he opposes such
mobile weapons as the MX and Midgetman missiles, Dukakis denied
that he was giving the Soviets an advantage at the bargaining
table. He said modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal was ``an open
question.''
   Later Tuesday, after returning to Massachusetts, Dukakis
denounced Reagan for allowing Coast Guard budget cuts that he said
have hampered the war on drugs.
   Dukakis held a meeting with Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., and
leaders of a regional drug taks force aboard the Coast Guard cutter
Vigilant, and he said the commander told him the ship would remain
at the docks for the next several months because of the cuts.
   ``This is our first line of defense,'' Dukakis said. ``It
doesn't make any sense. ... We need them.''
   In Washington, he called for persuading the Soviets ``to
withdraw some of their advanced armored equipment from Eastern
Europe and to withdraw bridging equipment from their forward-based
divisions.''
   He also called for talks ``to eliminate the threat of chemical
warfare not only in Europe, but throughout the world.''
   ``But while we negotiate, we must strengthen the alliance as
well, beginning with our conventional forces,'' Dukakis said.
   ``The commanders of our armed forces have repeatedly warned us
of the dangers we face. Maintenance backlogs are growing. We have
serious shortfalls in airlift and sealift, in spare parts and
ammunition,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Chairman Says Bill To Give Diesel Fuel Tax Relief To
Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee said Tuesday his panel will begin writing a tax bill next
week that will include relief for farmers from the tax on diesel
fuel.
   ``I'm encouraged,'' the chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
said after separate meetings with Democrats and Republicans on his
panel.
   The bill likely would be the only tax legislation that has a
chance of passing Congress this year. The main purpose of the bill
would be correcting errors in the 1986 tax overhaul, but the
committee could attach to the bill any of dozens of other tax
provisions that have been proposed.
   However, the number of successful amendments is likely to be
small this year because of budget agreements requiring that any
provision cutting taxes be offset by another that raises revenues.
   Most such amendments usually are added when a tax bill goes
through the Senate. But Rostenkowski said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, is ``encouraged that he
can hold a very well disciplined bill together on the floor of the
Senate'' _ that is, that he could protect it against serious
amendment.
   ``That's encouraging to me,'' Rostenkowski told reporters.
   Rostenkowski acknowledged that any bill will include a popular
provision to excuse farmers and state and local governments from a
new law requiring them to pay taxes on their purchases of diesel
fuel and then apply to the treasury for a rebate. The Finance
Committee already has voted to repeal the requirement.
   The chairman said there is considerable support on his committee
for extending some tax breaks that have expired or are scheduled to
end later this year. These include a tax exemption for revenue
bonds that help first-time homebuyers; a credit for increased
research and development, and a tax credit that encourages
employers to hire the poor.
   Because of budget restrictions, Rostenkowski said, any extension
of expiring provisions likely would be limited to one or two years.
   The chairman indicated there may not be enough support on the
committee to toughen the tax on unrelated business income of
organizations that generally are tax-exempt. Some lawmakers,
striving to help small business against unfair competition, have
called for taxation of such income, including that from
universities' sale of computers and non-profit hospitals' newstands.
   Any tax bill that is debated this year is likely to face
amendment by lawmakers who want to reduce the tax on capital gains,
which are profits from the sale of stocks, land and other assets.
   This issue is complicated by the fact that advocates of a
reduction _ including Vice President George Bush _ contend such a
move would increase tax collections by encouraging investment.
Opponents deny it.
   Another hot issue is a ``taxpayer bill of rights,'' aimed at
curbing alleged excesses of the Internal Revenue Service. The
Finance Committee has approved a version but Ways and Means
Committee members have been cool to the idea.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Army Nurse Statue for Vietnam Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday easily approved a bill
authorizing a bronze statue of an Army nurse at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial to honor the women who were part of America's
longest war.
   The bill was passed, 96-1, and sent to the House.
   Sponsored by Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., the measure had 75
co-sponsors and was endorsed by the Interior Department.
   The statue would be added to the 2.2 acre Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, located on the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial.
   The memorial, built with $11 million in private funds, was
opened in 1982 and has become one of the city's most visited
monuments. Its polished black granite walls bear the names of the
more than 58,000 Vietnam war dead, including eight uniformed nurses.
   Durenberger told his colleagues Tuesday the statue would be ``an
appropriate and long overdue symbol of this nation's gratitude for
the sacrifices and contributions of the 10,000 women who served in
Vietnam.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., called the new statue ``altogether
appropriate'' to honor the women who took part in the Vietnam war.
   The opposition vote was cast by Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., who
also opposed the measure last month when it was approved by the
Energy and Natural Resources Commission.
   Evans said then that his opposition was based on his belief that
another statue would destroy the artistic integrity of the Vietnam
Memorial.
   The female statue also was opposed by the Commission of Fine
Arts and the National Capitol Planning Commission, whose members
argued the Vietnam memorial was already complete and no new statues
should be added.
   Maya Lin, the architect who designed the memorial, also opposed
the addition of the female statue.
   In 1984, two years after the original memorial was finished, a
statue of three infantrymen and an American flag were added near
the end of one of the two walls which comprise the memorial.
   Durenberger said backers of the bill want to halt the addition
of any more statutes to the Vietnam monument. The bill includes a
provision noting that ``after the addition of the (female) statue,
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial will be complete and no other
additions to the site will be authorized or undertaken.''

<HEAD>Firefighters Continue Battling Wildfires in New Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters contained a wildfire that scorched nearly 500 acres
Tuesday and battled to control several smaller fires sparked by
lightning in southwestern New Mexico in recent days.
   The biggest fire burned at least 475 acres of grass and
woodland, including pinon, juniper and ponderosa pine trees, on
U.S. Bureau of Land Management land, officials said.
   The blaze, located on Pelona Mountain about 110 miles southwest
of Albuquerque, was contained after about 175 firefighters cut a
fire line with hand tools, said Ron Dunton, state fire management
officer for the BLM in Santa Fe.
   The blaze, which was first reported Saturday afternoon, was one
of at least 25 reported since Friday, when a storm moved through
the area.
   Many of the fires were small and did not burn long, said George
Ewan of the U.S. Forest Service. All were triggered by lightning,
he said.
   Ray Polasky, operations bureau chief for the state Forestry
Division, said a 70-acre fire on Luera Peak about 60 miles
southwest of Socorro was expected to be controlled, or effectively
extinguished, by Tuesday evening. The fire's spread was contained
Monday.
   The fire started Saturday and burned ponderosa pine trees on
Forest Service and private land.
   Elsewhere, a fire burned about 30 acres at Shaw Canyon, between
the Pelona Mountain and Luera Peak blazes, and another fire in
Whitewater Canyon in the Gila National Forest blackened at least 15
acres, according to Willie Zapata, Forest Service relief dispatcher
in Silver City. More than 50 firefighters battled the two blazes.
   Crews also fought two smaller fires covering about 2 acres each
in the Gila forest near the Arizona border, Zapata said.
   In addition, firefighters monitored four small fires covering
less than one-tenth of an acre each in the Sacramento Mountains in
south-central New Mexico, said Ed Wood, Forest Service public
information officer.

<HEAD>World's Rice Production Heading Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's output of rice is headed up, led
by a sharply expanded acreage in the United States, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   If indicated plantings are borne out and yields are in line with
past trends, U.S. rice production could be around 157 million
hundredweight this year, up 23 percent from 1987, the department's
Economic Research Service said.
   Assuming a return to normal weather in Asia, foreign production
could rise 7 percent in 1988-89, the agency said. In that case,
global rice consumption would be expected to increase substantially
following last year's decline, the first since 1971-72.
   ``Global trade probably will rise in 1988-89 as exportable
supplies become more plentiful,'' the report said. ``While the
United States stands to benefit from the growth in consumption and
trade, competition for world markets in 1989 may intensify.''

<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. says it will appeal a
nearly $70 million award to two former vice presidents who claimed
they were illegally fired for refusing to bribe foreign officials
or cover up such bribes.
   A U.S. District Court jury Friday awarded Bill McKay $44,594,936
and Harry D. Williams $24,980,431.
   Ashland, in a prepared statement, said it was ``very
disappointed by the verdict,'' which it said was not supported by
the evidence, and planned to appeal.
   The company maintained throughout the trial that payments to
secure Arab oil during the 1970s and 1980s went to men of influence
who were not government officials.
   The jury decided that three of the men were government officials
when they were paid and that at least two cases of bribery
occurred, putting the case under the Racketeering Influence
Corruption Act (RICO), a federal law usually aimed at organized
crime.
   Ashlandm also maintained the men were fired for ineffective work
and claimed the plaintiffs conspired to get fired in order to sue
Ashland.
   The jury's decision came after a 35-day trial. Named as
defendants were the company, former chairman Orin Atkins, current
chairman John R. Hall, vice chairman Robert McCowan and vice
president Dick Spears.

<HEAD>Ireland To Appeal Failed Extradition Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it will
appeal an Irish court's release of a man wanted in Britain on
bombing charges. The ruling struck a blow to the new British-Irish
extradition agreement.
   In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher blamed Irish
officials for losing the extradition case and said the two
governments were holding ``urgent consultations.'' It was Britain's
first extradition attempt under the agreement signed Dec. 1.
   Patrick McVeigh, 37, was freed Monday after a district court
ruled the Irish government had not properly established his
identity and said British police failed to produce witnesses that
could identify the suspect.
   Britain sought his extradition to face charges in connection
with explosions between 1981 and 1983 in London that killed two
people outside Chelsea Barracks and a bomb disposal expert in
Oxford Street.
   Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons: ``The Crown Prosecution
Service have done everything they could. ... They expressly asked
whether further evidence from the United Kingdom on identification
was needed and was told it was not.''
   Irish Justice Minister John Murray, addressing the Parliament in
Dublin, said the government was ``very deeply concerned'' by the
case and will appeal to the High Court.
   He said British officials had told Irish authorities that no
British police officer was ``in a position to make a personal
identification of Patrick McVeigh as the person concerned in the
alleged offense.''
   But he said the British officials were told further evidence of
identification was not required because the information given to
the court to identify the suspect as McVeigh was in accordance with
established norms.
   McVeigh, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, was arrested May 18 as
he left Portlaoise prison outside Dublin after serving five years
of a seven-year sentence for arms offenses linked to the Irish
Republican Army, outlawed in both Britain and Ireland.
   McVeigh was seized only days after the British and Irish
governments settled legal differences that had prevented any
extradition efforts this year under the new pact. Britain and
Ireland agreed to make positive identification a chief factor in
extradition.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the predomidnantly Catholic Irish Republic.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis declared in a speech on defense Tuesday
that ``we don't need SDI,'' while Republican George Bush retorted
that Dukakis is ``wrong, wrong'' for opposing the Strategic Defense
Initiative and the MX missile.
   ``He's wrong twice,'' the vice president told reporters in
Washington.
   Bush concentrated on education, proposing a new $500 million
program to reward schools that improve their performance in
educating disadvantaged children.
   Meanwhile, the Boston lawyer in charge of Dukakis' search for a
running mate conferred with Democratic congressional and party
leaders, and a new poll indicated the Massachusetts governor still
holds a big lead over Bush as the summer conventions near.
   Jesse Jackson, in Salt Lake City to address the nation's mayors,
continued to insist he has earned the right to consideration for
the vice presidency, though he didn't say he would accept it if
offered.
   Not only did he do well in the Democratic primaries, he said,
but ``I have an expertise in third world relations that the nation
needs.'' He added, ``The black constituency has earned the
consideration.''
   Dukakis, in a speech to the Atlantic Council in Washington,
called for a shift in emphasis to conventional forces as the key to
defense of Europe and said that if President Reagan can reach an
agreement with the Soviet Union on long-range missiles ``I strongly
urge the administration to go for it.''
   Education was the topic for the Republican vice president, who
called for a $500 million program to reward schools that come up
with innovative programs to help disadvantaged students.
   Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach said Paul Brountas, a
close friend and adviser to the Massachusetts governor, was
conferrring with leading Democrats in Washington and ``asking them
for their thoughts'' on the vice presidential selection process.
   Dach said Brountas would meet with House and Senate leaders as
well as other key elected and party officials.
   Then, the spokesman said, the plan is for Brountas and Dukakis
to ``get together and have a conversation about what they've both
heard about names and ideas on how to go forward and then go on
from there.''
   Dach refused to identify people with whom Brountas was meeting.
An aide to Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, one of the people mentioned
most often as a potential Dukakis running mate, said Brountas had
asked the senator for a meeting. Brountas was also to meet with
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
   Also Tuesday, a new Gallup poll found 52 percent support for
Dukakis and 38 percent for Bush. The same poll a month ago gave
Dukakis a 54-38 lead.
   Two other recent polls had single-digit leads for Dukakis, 49-44
in a Harris poll conducted June 1-6 and 45-39 in a USA Today-CNN
poll June 7-9.
   The newest poll was conducted by Gallup for the Boston Globe and
Boston television stations WEEI and WCVB June 10-12 among 1,005
registered voters. It had a margin of sampling error of four
percentage points.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who dropped out of the
Democratic presidential race after the New York primary, planned to
endorse Dukakis on Thursday in Nashville, Tenn., as the governor
opened a Southern campaign swing.
   Gore, whose name also is on many observers' vice presidential
lists, planned to fly to Boston on Wednesday and then go to
Tennesse with Dukakis. Before going to Boston, Gore also had a
meeting scheduled in his Senate office with Jackson.
   Bush spoke to a Washington luncheon honoring 139 Presidential
Scholars, some of the nation's top high school seniors.
   ``I believe the best thing we can do is invest in our young
people,'' said the vice president.
   Bush called for rewarding schools ``that significantly improve
their performance'' serving disadvantaged students.
   ``Let the states determine the criteria for improvement,'' he
said. ``Each school meeting the criteria would be recognized as a
National Merit School.''
   The vice president said such schools would receive federal
grants averaging $100,000.
   ``Each winning school could use the money as it pleased _ for
lab equipment, library books or rewards for teachers and
principals,'' he said.
   Speaking to the Atlantic Council meeting at the State
Department, Dukakis said, ``We all know that the defense budget
isn't going to increase in real terms unless an emergency arises,
no matter who the next president is. ... The time has come to make
tough choices on defense.''
   ``We don't need MX missiles running around on railroad cars. We
need an anti-tank weapon that can stop Soviet tanks,'' he said.
   Referring to Reagan's proposal for a space-based missile defense
system, Dukakis said, ``We don't need SDI; we need CDI, the
Conventional Defense Initiative begun by leaders of the Congress to
apply advanced technology to the challenge of fighting and winning
a conventional war.''
   Dukakis also said he did not believe the recently approved
treaty to remove U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles from Europe
meant a lessening of the U.S. commitment to defense of the
continent.
   ``I don't buy that at all,'' he said. ``Our commitment to Europe
goes far beyond a few hundred missiles.''
   But he also called for European allies to pay a greater share of
the burden of maintaining military strength in Europe.

<HEAD>Fed Chair Says Further Dollar Devaluation Unnecessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said Tuesday that a further decline in the dollar may hurt, rather
than help, efforts to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.
   Greenspan, in a speech to The Economic Club of New York, said
the devaluation of the dollar over the past three years has helped
narrow the trade gap by dampening demand for more expensive foreign
goods in the United States and stimulating sales of cheaper U.S.
goods overseas.
   However, Greenspan said it is questionable whether the United
States has the capacity to boost production of exports any faster
than the current growth rate.
   Thus, further declines in the dollar, by raising the price of
imports, could actually cause the deficit to grow, he said.
   ``I find no adjustment benefit to be derived from a further fall
in the dollar,'' he said in a text of his speech released in
Washington.
   In three years the dollar has lost about half of its value when
measured against the Japanese yen. It rose somewhat in trading
Tuesday on the news that the U.S. trade deficit for April had
fallen to $9.9 billion, its lowest level in nearly 3{ years.
   It was the second time in less than a week that Greenspan has
spoken against a further drop in the dollar. He issued a similar
warning June 8 after meeting in Chicago with other nations' central
bankers.
   Rather than devaluing the dollar, Greenspan said in New York,
``reducing our federal budget deficit would be the most important
step we can take in the adjustment process.''
   On another topic, Greenspan said despite strained capacity in
steel and certain chemicals, statistics on industrial delivery
times do not indicate that inflationary bottlenecks are developing.
   Delivery times for production materials have moved up only
moderately since late 1985 and have stabilized, at least
temporarily, during the past five months, he said.

   Moslem guerrillas have punched
through defenses of Afghanistan's second-largest city and delayed
Soviet troop withdrawal, Western diplomatic sources said Tuesday.
   The sources, speaking on condition their names not be used, said
the guerrillas have penetrated the defenses of Kandahar, a
provincial capital of 20,000 people about 270 miles southwest of
Kabul, Afghanistan's capital.
   One diplomatic source, quoting a Kandahar resident, said
guerrillas have been entering the city's bazaars daily to hunt
communist military and government personnel.
   The diplomatic sources also said fighting there and the Afghan
army garrison at Spin Buldak had slowed the Soviets' pullout from
Kandahar province and increased speculation they may reinforce the
area with additional troops. Spin Buldak is 60 miles southeast
Kandahar, on the Pakistani border.
   Reports indicate the main areas of combat, in addition to
Kandahar and Kabul, are at Ghazni to the south, Khost to the east
and Baghlan city to the north near the Soviets' main withdrawal
route.
   Pakistani sources say the guerrillas have taken the offensive
this spring, capturing more than 25 towns and communist posts in
the last three months.
   However, the diplomatic sources said Moscow's overall withdrawal
from the country was continuing, with convoys last weekend heading
north through Kabul from the eastern garrisons of Ghazni and Gardez.
   They agreed with Kremlin figures that 13,000 Red Army troops
have crossed the Oxus River onto home territory since the
nine-month pullout began May 15 under an accord negotiated in
Geneva.
   Afghanistan's Marxist president, Najib, said at the United
Nations last week that 34,000 Soviets had left _ about a third of
the more than 100,000 Soviets in Afghanistan.
   In Moscow Tuesday, a Foreign Ministry official said Soviet
troops on their way out of Afghanistan will strike back at Moslem
guerrillas who attack.
   Vadim I. Kuznetsov, deputy head of the ministry's U.S. desk,
said that under the Geneva withdrawal accords, ``our troops were
not supposed to take part in combat as they withdraw. Now they can.
Obviously, they are going to defend themselves.''
   Kuznetsov told The Associated Press there had been casualties,
but that he was unable to give the extact time, place and extent of
the attacks.
   His remarks were the most detailed explanation of a warning
issued Monday by Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Najib that
violations of the accord would bring ``resolute retaliatory steps.''
   Soviet troops came to Afghanistan in 1979 to bolster the
communist government.
   The Indian Embassy, which already closed its missions in
Kandahar and the eastern city of Jalalabad, has begun evacuating
personnel from Kabul, according to the source.
   That report appeared to contradict assertions this week by
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi that survival prospects for
Najib's government were good.

<TEXT>
   Investigators have removed a broken deceleration
device from an Alaska Airlines jet that veered from a runway after
landing and injured five passengers, officials said Tuesday.
   The device, called a thrust reverser, slows planes during
landings by diverting a jet engine's thrust. The recovery provided
a possible explanation of why the Boeing 727-200 failed to stop on
the runway Sunday night at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   ``We don't know when it occurred, but one side (of the two-piece
unit) worked and the other was broken,'' said Candace Carrera, the
National Transportation Safety Board's investigator in charge.
   The broken piece could create a ``twisting'' motion of the
aircraft, Ms. Carrerra said, adding, ``That's getting into analysis
and we're just not that far yet.''
   The broken thrust reverser was on the center engine of the
three-engine jet, Ms. Carrerra said.
   Investigators were disassembling the piece and will send it to
NTSB laboratories in Washington, D.C. for further testing, she
said. Other plane parts were being tested in Seattle.
   Representatives of Seattle-based Boeing were assisting in the
investigation.
   Five of the 75 passengers aboard were injured slightly when
Flight 187 from Tucson, Ariz. veered 400 feet off the runway and
slid to a stop in mud, said Margo Spellman, a spokeswoman for
Sea-Tac airport. Two were treated and released at area hospitals;
three were treated at the scene.
   Airport officials earlier said four passengers were injured.
   Interviews with pilot Jim Wiley, 40, and the six other crew
members Monday failed to shed any fresh light on the cause of the
accident, Ms. Carrera said.
   Investigators appear to have ruled out a tire blowout as the
cause, she said. When the jet's wheels were dug from the mud
Monday, the left tire of the two-tire nose landing gear was found
to be flat.
   ``It wasn't a blowout, it was a deflated tire. It scraped off
rubber while trying to stop,'' Ms. Carrera said.

   A portion of construction repair work at
an Interstate 10 drainage structure collapsed Tuesday, injuring at
least eight people, authorities said.
   Texas Highway Department crews were dispatched to the collapse,
on El Paso's west side near an interchange under construction.
   At least eight people were injured, one critically, emergency
medical workers said.
   ``Some part of the repair work has fallen in this drainage
structure,'' said Betty Best, highway department spokeswoman.
   In February, a piece of heavy equipment struck a couple of
columns in the drainage structure, at an arroyo that flows under
I-10, causing an undetermined amount of damage, Ms. Best said.
Another contractor was replacing the damaged area, she said.
   ``What were damaged were columns _ the pillars that hold up the
lanes of the interstate,'' she said.
   Ms. Best said the collapse has not affected freeway travel.
   Jesus Soto, 52, of Fort Hancock, was admitted to Sun Towers
Hospital Tuesday and was listed in critical and unstable condition,
hospital spokeswoman spokeswoman Anne Moncure said.
   Seven others from the construction site were taken to local
hospitals, with four listed in stable condition and one in guarded
condition, hospital spokesmen said. The condition of the other two
workers was not determined yet, they said.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some residents of a quiet Tampa neighborhood
say they are unhappy and fearful to find that their new neighbor is
Lawrence Singleton, who was convicted in California of raping a
girl and chopping her arms off.
   ``We don't want him here. Let them ship him back to
California,'' said Winston Whittle, a retiree living directly
across the street. ``Maybe commmunity pressure could be put on him.
If it could be done out in California, it could be done here.''
   Singleton, 60, was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker,
chopping her arms off above the elbow and leaving her for dead
along a rural roadside southeast of San Francisco in 1978. The
former merchant seaman, who grew up in Tampa, served eight years of
a 14-year sentence.
   When Singleton was released on parole, residents of a number of
California communities raised loudly vocal campaigns when their
communities were mentioned as possible homes for the notorious
inmate. One town even filed a lawsuit.
   Eventually, Singleton wound up serving his parole while housed
in a mobile home on the grounds of San Quentin prison.
   After he finished parole in April, Singleton came back to his
home town and for his Florida driver's license registered his
address as that of his brother, Walter Singleton, in the Forest
Hills section of Tampa.
   On Monday, he also registered with the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement to satisfy a state law requiring felons entering the
state to register with authorities.
   Ed Williams, agent in charge of the enforcement agency in Tampa,
said Singleton was photographed and fingerprinted and told agents
he was receiving Social Security.
   Forest Hills is a quiet, well-kept section where houses sit on
big lots, shaded by spreading oaks. Many of the residents are
retired.
   Men in the area say women, especially widows and those living
alone, are afraid.
   A gray-haired lady who lives with her sister and their little
white poodle acknowledged being worried. ``Naturally, we're
afraid,'' she said, asking that her name not be used.
   Robert Hosak lives next door to Whittle. He has owned his own
home for 20 years and says Walter Singleton and his wife Diane have
lived across the street for about that same length of time.
   ``She has been a good neighbor,'' Hosak said of Mrs. Singleton.
``I feel sorry for the family. He's a relative. What can they do?''
   Hosak said he followed the Singleton case 10 years ago in the
newspapers but didn't know until Monday that Singleton was related
to the family in his neighborhood.
   ``The fault isn't his. It's the system's fault for letting him
out,'' Hosak said.
   Lillian Shepler also doesn't like the idea of Singleton living
nearby.
   ``I feel he needs custodial care. Being shunted wherever he goes
is no picnic,'' she said. ``But the courts have found him guilty
and you have to live with the knowledge that he's living next door.
You never know, someone could go beserk.''
   Singleton tries to avoid headlines and maintains his innocence,
saying he has considered filing a complaint against the woman he
was convicted of raping. The woman, now 24, lives in seclusion in
the Pacific Northwest.

the march to the right of the nation's largest Protestant

   In the high-stakes contest, the Rev. Jerry Vines got 15,804
votes, or 50.5 percent, to defeat the Rev. Richard Jackson, who had
15,112, or 48.3 percent.
   Two other surprise nominees got a small scattering of ballots.
James Craig, a Tulsa, Okla., engineer, had 276 votes, the Rev. Anis
Shorrosh of Mobile, Ala., who had nominated himself, received 82.
   Vines' victory for a one-year term, which is traditionally
renewed for a second year, extended the fundamentalist wing's
denominational control into the 10th year it said it needed to
enact its conservative theological-political agenda.
   Vines, 50, is co-pastor of the First Baptist Church of
Jacksonville, Fla., while runner-up Jackson, 49, is pastor of the
North Phoenix Baptist Church in Phoenix, Ariz. Each church has
about 18,000 members.
   Because of the size and country-wide influence of the 14.7
million member denomination, the direction set here was seen as
having an impact in broader evangelical circles.
   About 35,000 ``messengers,'' as local church representatives are
called, were present for the opening day of the Southern Baptist
Convention's meeting, which runs through Thursday.
   Before the election, the outgoing president, the Rev. Adrian
Rogers of Memphis, Tenn., unleashed a scathing attack on
denominational ``liberals,'' which is what fundamentalists call the
moderates.
   ``They have turned Protestant Christianity into a graveyard,''
he said.
   Likening them to ``leaven of the Pharisees,'' he said such
``theological morticians have no right in Baptist pulpits.''
   The Rev. Russell Dilday, president of Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, criticized Rogers'
``divisive tone.''
   ``There was a frantic note, a pulling out of all the stops'' as
if fearful of the election outcome, Dilday told reporters. ``I
think our Baptist forefathers would be shocked.''
   Moderates who have been gradually cut out of power by the
prolonged fundamentalist surge have indicated they're not pulling
out and splitting the denomination.
   ``We're not dead and I'm not quitting,'' said the Rev. Winfred
Moore of Amarillo, Texas, a moderate leader.
   But he derided compromise with fundamentalists' demands. ``My
granddaddy was absolutely right. He said, `Son, there's nothing in
the middle of the road but a yellow line and dead possums,''' Moore
told a side meeting of moderate pastors.
   Zoological analogies also got a pre-election airing in the
fundamentalist camp where a fiery Dallas leader, the Rev. W.A.
Criswell, declared:
   ``Liberals today call themselves moderates. A skunk by any other
name still stinks.''
   Bringing out the socio-political aspects of the fundamentalist
drive, he blamed the ``curse of liberalism'' for turning the nation
over to secularists, humanists, atheists and infidels.
   ``By law and legislation, we bow at no altar and call on the
name of no God,'' he said. ``No longer can we pray in public
schools, read God's word'' or ``have chapel services in public
schools or place a nativity scene on the courthouse lawn.''
   Among American Christians, Southern Baptists always have been
pervasively conservative in their theology, stressing the autonomy
of local congregations, church-state separation, no creedal rules
but the Bible and ``soul competence'' of individuals to interpret
it as they understand it.
   But the fundamentalist wing that won predominance in 1979, and
has held it since, insists on viewing the Bible as literalistically
``inerrant'' _ without error _ historically, religiously and
scientifically.
   Under the shiboleth of ``inerrancy,'' the fundamentalist wing
has pressed a wide socio-political program generally identified
with the new religious right that emerged about the same time at
the turn of the 1980s.
   As the fundamentalists gained sway over institutional trustees
through presidential appointive powers, several organizational and
seminary staff members have been hit by restrictions and pressures
that drove them from their posts.
   Screening processes have been instituted to make sure personnel
adhere to certain beliefs, such as that Adam and Eve were real
people and that biblical miracles actually occurred.
   Also, policies were invoked against women clergy and employing
divorced pastors in most cases.
   Baptist fundamentalists unavailingly backed Judge Robert Bork
for the U.S. Supreme Court, contrary to Baptist practice against
taking sides about particular candidates.
   The fundamentalist wing also has marshalled the denomination for
other religious right causes _ prayer in public schools, capital
punishment and condemning all abortion except to save the mother's
life.

   Democrat Dave Moss announced Tuesday he
will seek his party's nomination for congressional seat held by
Republican Bob Stump.
   Moss, 64, a former candidate for governor, condemned what he
called lifetime jobs in the House as being detrimental to
democracy. Stump is in his sixth term.
   ``The whole idea of a House of Representatives focused on the
principle of citizen legislator,'' said Moss. ``The House is
becoming too impenetrable to be representative _ a trend which
could undermine the very legitimacy of the House.''
   Moss, a semi-retired business broker from Mohave County, said a
major issue he plans to push is a canal to be built from Yuma to
the Gulf of California to stimulate Mexico's economy.

<HEAD>Extradition Hearing For West German Suspect Sparks Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dutch riot police battled West
German and Dutch demonstrators outside a courthouse in Amsterdam on
Tuesday where a suspect in the murder of two West German policemen
was fighting extradition.
   A running street battle began during a hearing on the
extradition of 25-year-old Frank Hoffmann to West Germany.
   Hoffmann, a West German citizen, denies involvement in the Nov.
2 shootings, which occurred during a demonstration against building
a new runway at Frankfurt's Rhein-Main Airport.
   Hoffmann wore a leg restraint during the hearing.
   Defense attorney Pieter Bakker Schut argued that the killings
were political crimes, for which Dutch law bans extradition.
   Public prosecutor M. Bonn conceded the two killings were
``politically influenced'' but argued they could not be regarded as
political crimes.
   A ruling on the extradition request is set for June 28.
   At least eight protesters were arrested in the fighting outside,
said police spokesman Leo Detering. Police used baton charges to
disperse about 100 protesters, many of them masked to avoid
identification.
   Dozens of flak-jacketed police stood guard inside and outside
the courthouse and four armed guards were detailed to Hoffman.
   Aside from those directly involved in the proceedings, only
reporters were allowed inside the courtroom. About 30 Hoffmann
sympathizers watched from a public gallery separated from the
courtroom by bullet-proof glass.
   West German authorities say Hoffmann shot the West German
officers with a police service pistol he stole during the protest.
He also is charged with the attempted murder of two other policemen
during the protest.
   West Germany also wants Hoffmann for alleged membership in an
unspecified ``terrorist organization'' and for attacks against
property in protests against West Germany's nuclear energy program.
   Hoffmann denied involvement in all instances. He grinned at his
sympathizers and yelled ``Rebellion! Resistance!'' as police
hustled him out of the courtroom at the end of the hearing.

   Evan Mecham's defense lawyer told a jury
Tuesday the former governor is being unjustly prosecuted by a
politically ambitious attorney general whose aides are ``like the
guards at Auschwitz.''
   ``The prosecution wants a conviction in this case ...
notwithstanding the innocence of these defendants,'' lawyer Michael
Scott said in closing arguments in Maricopa County Superior Court.
   Prosecutor Michael Cudahy insisted Mecham and his brother,
Willard, purposely concealed a $350,000 campaign loan from
developer Barry Wolfson on financial reports required by the state.
   ``Evan Mecham never had any intention of disclosing the Wolfson
loan,'' Cudahy said.
   The prosecution was scheduled to finish its rebuttal Wednesday
morning before the case is submitted to the jury for deliberations.
   ``I'm glad this day is here,'' Mecham, 64, told reporters before
the arguments began. ``I want to get it over with. I want to get on
with my life.''
   Scott told the jurors that there was no motive to conceal
Wolfson as the source of the loan because the campaign's financial
reports were filed after the November 1986 election.
   The defense lawyer said Mecham could have been charged with a
misdemeanor for false campaign finance reporting, ``but a
misdemeanor is not good enough for (Attorney General) Bob Corbin
and his henchmen.''
   Corbin wanted a conviction on felony charges to further his own
political ambitions, but he is ``not entitled to bring home Evan
Mecham's scalp and hang it in the trophy room at the attorney
general's office,'' Scott said.
   ``Perhaps I shouldn't be so hard on my colleagues because, like
the guards at Auschwitz, they're just doing their job,'' he said,
referring to the prosecutors.
   Auschwitz was a Nazi death camp.
   In his rebuttal, co-prosecutor Barnett Lotstein accused Scott of
making a ``vicious personal attack'' on him and Cudahy. ``It's not
a new tactic. It's used when you don't have anything else to say,''
Lotstein said.
   Cudahy said Mecham desperately needed money for his 1986
gubernatorial campaign, which had a theme of integrity and
abolishing special interests.
   ``Along came a pot of gold in the form of Barry Wolfson, and
Evan Mecham wound up selling that theme of integrity and ridding
the state of hidden special interests when he and Willard Mecham
decided to hide from the public the $350,000 loan,'' Cudahy said.
   Cudahy said testimony showed that even some of Mecham's top
aides and people who signed promissory notes to back the loan were
not told it was coming from Wolfson and not from a bank.
   The loan was hidden on a campaign financial report as part of a
``fabricated'' $465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from
Mecham, Cudahy said. He also pointed to a letter in which Mecham
promised Wolfson the loan would ``remain confidential.''
   Scott contended that the loan was properly reported as part of
the $465,000 lump sum because Mecham was responsible for its
repayment.
   Mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents and faced up to 22 years in
prison if convicted.
   Willard Mecham, who was his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer,
faced three similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison if
convicted.
   Mecham, a Republican, took office in January 1987 and was
removed April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of two
unrelated charges.

<TEXT>
   The fundamentalist operator of an
unlicensed boarding school closed by the state amid allegations of
abuse and neglect said Tuesday he didn't want supporters to bail
him out of jail.
   ``I don't want the people to put the money up for this _ not
when we're right,'' the Rev. Herman Fountain said.
   Fountain spoke after an appearance before a Youth Court judge
trying to decide the cases of 41 children taken last week by court
order from the Bethel Home for Children in Lucedale. He was held in
the George County jail in lieu of $40,000 bond on three charges of
felonious assault of a police officer.
   Meanwhile, $1,000 bonds were posted by two other people arrested
Monday, when 60 state troopers and local officers raided a church
on the 28-acre campus of the school. A June 24 court date was set
for the two.
   They were among five people, including assistant pastor David
Owens, who were charged with disorderly conduct when the church was
raided Monday.
   Since Friday, the state has taken 77 children from the home,
with about 35 released to their parents.
   Officers entered the church to look for three children Fountain
said he had taken back in. But Fountain said Tuesday the three
weren't among 11 children taken by the state in the Monday raid.
   State officials said they took all of the children because
church officials refused to identify for them the three they were
looking for.
   Fountain said Tuesday that he knew where the three were, but
wouldn't disclose their location, which he said wasn't on the
campus.
   ``If they are going to take these kids to the mental hospital, I
ain't going to have no part of it,'' Fountain said.
   The children turned over to the state temporarily were being
housed at the state psychiatric hospital at Whitfield.
   Fountain said he had heard that the children in state custody
were being allowed to smoke and play rock music.
   ``That really upsets me,'' he said.
   Asked about discipline methods at his school, which have come
under fire off and on since 1980, Foutain claimed only God can set
the limits but that he and staffers had guidelines.
   No more than 10 licks with a switch were allowed, he said. Asked
the kind of paddle or switch used, he said: ``An old mamma's switch
_ like the one you pick up in the woods.''
   Chancery Judge Robert Oswald, who presides over the youth court,
continued hearings at which he required parents or guardians to
promise not to send the children back to Bethel. He ruled that the
children, ages 10 to 17, had been subjected ``to physical abuse,
medical neglect and detention amounting to imprisonment'' at Bethel.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Thousands of Iraqi Casualties; Iraq Says New Front
Opened</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new details from both sides.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq claimed Tuesday that it recaptured
five strategic heights in new battles on the northern front while
Iran reported that the Iraqis suffered 19,000 casualties in their
southern offensive.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi forces backed by
helicopter gunships and fighter planes stormed Iranian-held
positions in northern Iraq to win back the heights.
   It said artillery, tank and infantry units joined in retaking
five Iranian positions in the mountain peaks of Suliamaniya
province, but It did not say when the offensive started or how long
it lasted.
   Iranian news reports made no mention of fighting in the north.
Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian forces killed or
wounded 19,000 Iraqis after launching a new offensive east of Basra
in southern Iraq on Monday.
   The various reports were monitored in Nicosia. Claims by the
opposing sides could not be independently verified as both
countries rarely allow independent observers near the 730-mile
front. The war began in September 1980.
   The Iranian military communique said more than 1,500 Iraqis were
killed or wounded Tuesday and that Iran's heavy artillery destroyed
tanks, personnel carriers and other vehicles.
   Iran also claimed that Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical weapons
on a village in Kurdistan province at 8 a.m. Tuesday, killing two
villagers and ``poisoning'' 10 others, according to IRNA.
   Iraq's official news agency said Tuesday that Iran's attack in
the southern zone was contained and Iraqi troops counterattacked.
   Iraq protested to the United Nations on Tuesday, saying
sanctions should be imposed against Iran for attacks on Iraqi
territory.
   In the Persian Gulf, Iranian gunboats riddled a
Singapore-flagged tanker with machine-gun fire as the ``tanker
war'' flared anew in northern waters that were relatively quiet for
months.
   Gulf-based shipping executives said the 87,768-ton Neptune
Subaru was attacked about 6 a.m. as it sailed toward Kuwait to pick
up a cargo of crude oil.
   The executives said no casualties were reported, the crew
extinguished several fires, and the ship sailed under its own power
to the Saudi Arabian port of Jubail.
   Iranian television on Tuesday quoted Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker
of Parliament and commander in chief of Iran's armed forces, as
saying he was ``pessimistic'' about Iraq surrendering in the war.
   Rafsanjani was quoted as saying Iran is ``not insisting on
getting our rights on the battlefield with military means.''
   That could indicate a softening in Iran's avowed determination
to crush the Iraqi government, but Rafsanjani also spoke of Iran's
insistence that the war will end only when President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq is ousted.
   Iraq has expressed its willingness to accept a U.N. Security
Council resolution passed last year calling for a cease-fire, but
Iran has not.
   In February 1986, Iran captured the Faw Peninsula near Basra but
was driven out by an Iraqi offensive last April. Iran launched new
attacks in late May to regain the peninsula at the northern tip of
the gulf and both sides have claimed victories.
   Iraq said Monday that its troops, under the direction of
President Hussein, fought for 19 hours to repulse the Iranian
incursion and that Hussein returned to the capital of Baghdad afer
the main fighting ended.
   Iran claimed its forces recaptured some of the land lost in
April.

<TEXT>
   A member of the Irish Republican Army should
be deported to the United Kingdom, Attorney General Edwin Meese III
ruled Tuesday, declaring that sending the man to Ireland instead
would be prejudicial to U.S. interests.
   Meese disapproved a decision by the Board of Immigration
Appeals, which had ruled there was insufficient evidence that
deportation of Joseph Patrick Thomas Doherty to Ireland would be
against U.S. interest.
   Doherty was convicted in the United Kingdom in 1981 of murder in
the ambush of a British army convoy in which a captain was killed.
   Doherty escaped from a prison in Belfast, Northern Ireland,
before sentencing, came to the United States in 1982 and has been
held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City since
1983 on charges he illegally entered the country using a false
passport.
   Doherty designated Ireland as the country to which he wished to
be deported.
   In reversing the Board of Immigration Appeals, Meese said U.S.
policy is that those who commit acts of violence against a
democratic state should receive swift and lawful punishment, and
that Doherty should serve his sentence in the United Kingdom.
   Michael Armacost, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
wrote the attorney general that a decision to deport Doherty to
Ireland would injure relations with the United Kingdom.
   ``Failure to return Doherty to the United Kingdom could
undermine'' Great Britain's ``confidence in the ability of the
United States to cooperate in counter-terrorism efforts of special
bilateral concern,'' Armacost said. Portions of the letter were
printed in Meese's decision.
   Meese's decision was denounced by a New York Republican
politician who is an activist for Irish causes.
   ``I'm demanding that Meese resign because I'm charging that he's
betrayed the Constitution by ordering Joseph Doherty deported to
the United Kingdom,'' said Peter King, Nassau County comptroller
and the unsuccessful Republican nominee for New York State attorney
general in 1986.
   ``Every court has ruled in favor of Doherty and yet Meese is
ordering him deported to a prison where he will be tortured and
spend the rest of his life in jail,'' King said. ``He is entitled
to political status in this country.''
   The Board of Immigration Appeals now must rule on Doherty's
request to withdraw an earlier admission that he is deportable. If
his request to withdraw the earlier admission is unsuccessful,
Doherty would be deported to the United Kingdom.
   If he prevails, he could file a request seeking asylum in the
United States or file a request for deportation to a country
besides Ireland or the United Kingdom.
   Meese acted on an appeal filed by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which had objected to Ireland as the
country to which Doherty should be sent.
   INS supplied an immigration judge with newspaper articles and
speeches on the issue of terrorism, but was unsuccessful in its
arguments after failing to submit additional evidence. The appeals
panel upheld the immigration judge's ruling.

   Gunmen kidnapped the three children of a
Sunni Moslem businessman Tuesday after stopping the car taking them
to school and shooting the driver in the legs, police reported.
   They said police units and Syrian soldiers in Moslem west Beirut
arrested four suspects but the victims were not found.
   A police spokesman said six gunmen in two cars intercepted the
chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz limousine Tuesday morning.
   ``Three gunmen jumped out of a white Volvo, shot the driver in
the legs from silencer-equipped pistols, pulled the children out
and forced them into another Mercedes-Benz and sped away,'' the
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, not identified according to police regulations,
said the victims were the children of Zuhair Ariss, owner of a
jewelry shop and a foreign exchange company in west Beirut.
   The officer idenfied the captives as Dunia, 14, and her brothers
Samer, 9, and Ramzi, 5.
   He said the kidnappings were carried out ``for ransom,''
although no note was received.
   A police communique said security forces seized four gunmen in
connection with the abductions in a raid on the bomb-ravaged Hilton
Hotel, controlled by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems of the Hezbollah,
or Party of God, organization.
   In other developments, a cease-fire officially took effect
Tuesday among Palestinian factions battling in two Beirut refugee
camps, but one group reportedly continued fighting.
   In Damascus, Syria, the Palestinian group Fatah-Uprising of Col.
Abu Mousa said Palestinian Liberation Organization factions began
observing the truce early Tuesday.
   But a spokesman for Mousa later said the mainstream Fatah group
of PLO chief Yasser Arafat continued fighting.
   The struggle for mastery of the Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh
camps flared last week between Arafat's group and the
Fatah-Uprising backed by Syria.
   Syrian troops recently moved into the southern suburbs of Beirut
to quell fighting between Shiite Moslem militias.
   In southern Lebanon, 20 Israeli soldiers continued to blockade
the outpost of a Norwegian unit of the U.N. peace-keeping force for
the second day.
   A U.N. source said the tension developed when the Norwegians
stopped the Israelis Sunday from establishing a checkpoint close to
a Norwegian outpost on the southern edge of Hebbariyeh village.
   Hebbariyeh is seven miles north of Israel's self-designated
security zone in southern Lebanon. It has a Norwegian garrison of
nine peacekeepers.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military official speaking on condition
of anonymity said the area where the Norwegians intervened was
inside the Israeli security zone.
   Norway has an 881-member battalion in the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon, made up of 5,800 troops from nine nations and deployed in
1978 to serve as a buffer in southern Lebanon. Its area overlaps
with the six-to-10-mile security zone Israel carved out north of
its border in 1985.

   A family tearfully accepted the remains of a
soldier Tuesday, more than two decades after his plane was shot
down over North Vietnam.
   ``The 22-year nightmare is over,'' said Joseph Chiarello,
brother of Lt. Col. Vincent Chiarello, an Air Force intelligence
officer.
   Anne Chiarello, the officer's mother, broke down during an honor
guard ceremony as the remains were presented to the family at
Philadelphia International Airport.
   Later, during a news conference, she said she will take off the
MIA bracelet engraved with her son's name that she has worn since
1978.
   ``I will be happy to wear one for another MIA until he comes
home,'' she said.
   Other relatives also said they will continue to help other
families with missing loved ones.
   ``We beseech the Vietnamese government ... to act expeditiously
on behalf of all these families,'' Joseph Chiarello said.
   Chiarello's plane was shot down near the Laotian border on July
29, 1966, according to Joanne Cornell, the officer's sister.
   About four months ago, the Air Force told the family the
Vietnamese government was returning the remains of 20 American
soldiers, including Chiarello.
   However, on March 3, the remains of only 17 soldiers were
returned along with identification cards for Chiarello and two
others. It took an exhaustive comparison of remains with dental,
military and family records to finally identify Chiarello.
   ``The findings were so definite,'' said Mrs. Cornell. ``We felt
we must accept this. We feel beyond a shadow of a doubt these are
my brother's remains.''
   Tom Engkilterra, a coordinator with the National League, an
organization working for information about all Americans missing in
Vietnam, said there were ``2,400 stories out there that need to be
told so this doesn't become a one-day event.''
   The family will bury the remains Saturday in Newtown, about 25
miles northeast of Philadelphia, after a funeral Mass.

   About 60,000 government employees demanding
more pay staged a one-day strike Tuesday, shutting down Israel's
railroads and disrupting government ministries, hospitals and
airports.
   Court clerks did not show up for work and tax offices were
closed.
   The job action originally was open-ended, but organizers later
called on workers to return to their jobs Wednesday.
   Union leaders said they will attach their labor dispute to the
wage negotiations being held between the Histadrut trade union
federation and the Finance Ministry.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir condemned the strike. ``I think
there was no need for the strike that causes damages and creates
inconvenience for the economy,'' he told Israel radio.
   At Ben Gurion International Airport, an emergency staff of 10
out of 180 customs officials checked the luggage of passengers on
incoming flights, Israel army radio reported.
   The strike affected the Interior Ministry, which stopped issuing
identity cards and passports, as well as the Employment Service and
the National Insurance Institute. Israel's Educational Television
stopped its broadcasts.
   The strike came after the failure of seven-hour talks Monday
between the union of civil servants and the Finance Ministry. Media
reports said the ministry told the strikers it will exclude the
strike days from their salaries.
   But union secretary Reuven Ben-Ami told the army radio that the
civil servants, whose average monthly salary is about $625, are
``ready to sacrifice to achieve better wages.''
   Union officials said they are demanding a wage increase of $77,
a raise in medical payments and an increase in the annual
recreation period covered by these payments to 15 days instead of
11.

   More than 100 University of Toronto students
defied campus administrators Tuesday and held a protest against
their university's acting as host for part of the seven-nation
economic summit conference next week.
   ``If no one's going to point out the crimes of the Group of
Seven, then we're all in trouble,'' said Michael Polanyi, 21, son
of professor John Polanyi, the Nobel laureate for chemistry in 1986
who teaches at the university.
   Leaders of the seven nations will visit the downtown campus for
working dinners Monday at Hart House, a cultural and social center.
   ``One of the reasons they are coming to Hart House is to find an
idyllic surrounding, but we just won't be quiet, we won't make it
easy for them,'' said Polanyi, a political science student and
spokesman for a coalition organizing a ``Popular Summit.''
   Asked what his father thought of his risking arrest, Polanyi
said, ``He's supportive.''
   The protesters erected eight tents on a lawn outside Hart House
in defiance of an administration ruling that the tent complex would
pose a threat to public health because of the lack of water and
sanitation.
   The students began the protest Tuesday evening with songs and
banners objecting to U.S. policy in Central America, British rule
in Northern Ireland and the presence of President Reagan and other
leaders on campus.
   University spokesman Stephen Lindt said campus police warned
students to disperse and threatened to issue tickets for illegal
trespassing and camping, which carry a $53 ($43 U.S.) fine.
   One of the protesters, Robert Bruckner, a 21-year-old
archaeology major, said students were upset that the university
decided to be host to the leaders of the United States, Canada,
Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Japan without consulting
the 34,000-member student body.
   ``Why aren't they (the seven leaders) talking about the problems
their economic system forces on the world _ poverty, homelessness,
the underfunding of universities, the problems of native peoples,
South Africa?'' he said.
   Last week, a Toronto anti-nuclear group staged a mock trial of
the summit leaders for alleged ``crimes against humanity,''
including U.S. aid to rebels in Nicaragua, nuclear armaments and
support for the white-led government of South Africa.

   Bidders offered more than $2.5 million Tuesday
for a trove of gold, silver and emeralds that had laid undisturbed
for centuries on the bottom of the sea until found by treasure
hunter Mel Fisher.
   A 62-inch-long gold chain formed from 136 oval links attracted
the most attention and fetched $319,000 in spirited but quick
bidding. The chain, purchased by an anonymous telephone bidder, had
an estimated pre-sale price of $150,000 to $250,000.
   The auction was the first of a two-day sale at Christie's
auction house of booty recovered from Spanish sailing ships
discovered in the Caribbean by Fisher, a diver who has devoted much
of his life to treasure hunting.
   The auction house said more than 70 percent of the items offered
Tuesday were sold for a total of $2,588,443.
   The treasure _ which included gold and silver bars, jewelry and
artifacts as well as coins, emeralds and 17th century navigation
instruments _ was taken mostly from the Spanish treasure galleons
Nuestra Senora de Atocha and her sister ship the Santa Margarita.
   The two vessels, battered by a hurricane, went down off the
Florida Keys in September 1622.
   A gold two-handled cup recovered from what's believed to be the
Santo Cristo de San Roman, part of the Spanish fleet sunk in 1715,
brought the night's second-highest sale price, $275,000. It was
bought by a London dealer, S.J. Phillips.
   The Santo Cristo was one of six wrecks found by salvors working
off the east coast of Florida near Vero Beach.
   Fisher, who attended the auction with heavy gold chains salvaged
from the Atocha draped around his neck, said he was satisfied with
the sale and said there would likely be others.
   ``We're still dividing the treasure. It's taken us three years
to divide it all up,'' he said.
   Tuesday's items were offered by backers who financed Fisher's
expeditions in exchange for a share of the proceeds.
   Fisher began his search for the Atocha in the Keys in 1968 and
found the vessel three years later. In 1980 he discovered the
Margarita.
   The treasure hunter himself had only one item in the sale, the
gold cup, which he owned with an investor.
   ``I didn't want to saw it in two, give him half and keep half,''
he said. So he sold it.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega and his
Cabinet on Tuesday discussed dramatic new economic policies that
lift price and wage controls, the president's office said.
   Details were not immediately known, but it appeared the leftist
Sandinista government was moving away from central control toward a
Western-style free market.
   Enrique Bolanos, president of the Superior Private Enterprise
Council, said his umbrella group for privately owned businesses
supports the removal of price controls. But he warned it might
further fuel inflation, now running at about 4,000 percent.
   Ortega failed to show up for a news conference Tuesday and his
office said he was held up by meetings with Cabinet members.
   Ortega announced on Saturday that the government was withdrawing
a wage scale in effect since 1985. The idea, he said, was to link
wages to productivity, sharply down in recent years.
   But some speculation arose that basing salaries on production
might cause a surge in unemployment.
   Six years of civil war coupled with U.S. trade sanctions enacted
in 1985 have shattered the Nicaraguan economy.
   ``For all intents and purposes, Nicaragua at the end of 1987 was
a bankrupt country,'' said a U.S. Embassy report in January.
   Nicaragua has a foreign debt of more than $6 billion. Soviet
bloc infusions of about $400 million a year fail to cover the
country's trade deficit.
   From 1980 to the end of 1987, inflation caused the average urban
worker's purchasing power to drop almost 90 percent.
   The government has controlled salaries, basic foodstuffs, the
prices of primary products and the distribution of imports and
exports.
   Measures taken by the government have failed to right the
economy, which was in disarray when the Sandinistas came to power
in a 1979 revolution that deposed dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   The Sandinistas promised broad social programs and benefits. But
the war by the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras started a little
more than a year after the revolution.
   Today, despite a fragile, three-month cease-fire, about 60
percent of the national budget goes toward defense. The Sandinistas
put the war's pricetag at $3 billion.
   Thousands of Nicaraguans fled the fighting for the cities,
leaving behind fertile lands in the northern and central war zones.
Young peasants who normally would work on farms are forced to fight
for either the Contras or the Sandinistas
   In April, the government began laying off 20,000 public
employees in hopes they would turn to agriculture.

   Veteran endurance runner Mary Margaret
Goodwin of Fort Lewis, Wash., reported Monday that she completed a
1,300-mile run through the Nepal-Himalayan region and said she was
the first solitary runner to do so.
   She said she had to cope with an elephant charge and 110-plus
heat to accomplish her feat, but added, ``I have done the
Nepal-Himalaya run exactly in one day less than three months. Now I
am crossing to India. But that is a big problem. At the moment the
border is closed.''
   Goodwin, 50, told The Associated Press by telephone from
Mahendranagar, about 330 miles southwest of Katmandu, that she
arrived at the Nepalese township along the border Sunday in a bid
to complete her trans-Himalayan run from India's Darjeeling city in
West Bengal state to Gulmarg in Kashmir, India.
   She left Darjeeling on March 11 and entered into the Himalayan
kingdom of Nepal two days later.
   Her only companion was a 2-year-old German shorthair pointer,
Velia.
   ``But India has closed this point of the border to foreigners,''
she said. ``The Banbasha Bazar of the northern Indian state of
Uttar Pradesh is only 15 miles away from here. But I can't go there
from here,'' goodwin said.
   She said that before setting she went to New Delhi and thought
she had secured permission from the Indian authorities for the
trans-Himalayan run.
   Goodwin said she sent a message to the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi
to approach the Indian authorities again.
   She described the crossing of the Nepalese Himalayan foothills
from one end of Nepal to the another as a ``big victory for me .. .
I have today become the fastest woman, and the first solo runner
through the Himalayan kingdom.''
   After leaving the mountainous region on Thursday, Goodwin said
she and her dog arrived at Chisapani in the tropical plains of
south Nepal.
   ``We had come through the tigers and snakes areas ... coming
from Chisapani all the way to Mahendranagar,'' she reported.
   She said she had to spend three days to complete the 112-mile
Chisapani-Mahendranagar route in a heat of more than 110 degrees.
   ``My dog had been surrounded by troops of monkeys all along the
road every day. And while we were resting on the bank of Karnali
River, a huge elephant came out of a nearby jungle, charging us ..
. both me and my dog.''
   They got out of that without harm, but she noted that ``even my
dog did not sleep on the ground because of snakes.''
   ``There was no bridge on the river,'' Goodwin said, ``My dog had
to swim. I was wading across it. But the water was very deep. So
all the day long, I had to move with wet shoes and wet clothes.''
   Goodwin has been participating in endurance events since the
1950s. She was the first woman to run the 1,000-mile route through
Scotland, Wales and England and also completed a 2,000-mile trip
through Japan in 1986.
   A former resident of northern Virginia, she served as director
of environmental and conservation matters in the Office of the
Secretary of the Navy from 1979-83.

   A House Judiciary panel is considering writing
tougher standards for FBI terrorism investigations in the United
States to prevent the bureau from violating the rights of
legitimate domestic political groups.
   Lawmakers concede that election-year politics probably will
delay action until 1989. But during a hearing on Monday into
alleged FBI abuses in an investigation of anti-Reagan
administration activists, members of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights agreed with
witnesses who recommended new controls on such investigations.
   FBI officials have said an internal investigation of the
operation found several problems with it, and The New York Times
reported today that an internal FBI report recommends disciplinary
action against some of those involved.

   A 28-year-old man went silently to his death
early today in the electric chair for the hammer slaying of a
cashier he had romanced, then robbed, becoming the nation's 100th
person executed since capital punishment resumed in 1977.
   Edward R. Byrne Jr. had argued that he did not intend to kill
the woman during the 1984 gas station robbery. But he said Monday
he had dated her with the intent of robbing her, knowing she
handled large sums of money. And he said when he tried to knock her
unconscious, ``It didn't work. She didn't become unconscious. I
just kept hitting her until she did.''
   Eighteen of the 100 executions since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty have been in Louisiana, which is tied
with Florida for the second-highest number nationally. Texas has
put 27 people to death.

   Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American advocate of
non-violent resistance to Israel, arrived here after Israel defied
the United States and deported him from his birthplace of Jerusalem.
   The deportation ended a seven-month legal battle and made Awad
the 21st Arab to be expelled by Israel since the Dec. 8 start of
the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Awad, 44, did not meet waiting reporters at Kennedy
International Airport after his arrival Monday night from Israel.
But a spokesman made a brief statement on his behalf and said Awad
planned to a hold a news conference this afternoon.
   ``He wanted me to express his deep appreciation'' to U.S.
officials who protested his deportation, said Charles Kimball,
director of the Middle East office of the National Council of
Churches. He named Secretary of State George Shultz, Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Murphy, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Thomas
Pickering and counsuls general in Israel Morris Draper and Bill
Wilcox.
   ``They have worked consistently, arduously and enormously
helpfully on his behalf from the beginning of this whole process,
and he's deeply grateful,'' Kimball said, his words at times
drowned out by the chanting of anti-Awad protesters.

   Share prices surged to new highs while the U.S.
dollar leaped in value against the Japanese yen early Wednesday, in
reaction to a report of better-than-expected U.S. trade figures for
April.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished the
morning session up 186.56 points at a record 28,248.36.
   The key market barometer had peaked last Thursday when it closed
at 28.072.02.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, morning session volume was a record
1.6 billion shares, dealers said. A total 930 million shares were
traded for all of Tuesday.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar opened at 126.36 yen, up sharply
from Tuesday's close of 125.05 yen, and changed hands in the
126.27-126.55 yen range before closing the morning trading at
126.15 yen.
   ``The largest factor for the dollar's rise is the improvement in
the U.S. trade deficit in April,'' said an exchange dealer at a
major commercial bank in Tokyo.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit narrowed in April to $9.89 billion, the
lowest level since December 1984, largely because of a decline in
imports.
   Financial markets have reacted strongly in recent months to U.S.
trade figures, which are seen as providing signals for the likely
direction of stocks and the dollar.
   The Bank of Tokyo said a total of $4.1 billion were traded in
brisk transactions on the foreign exchange market during the
morning session.

the members' inability to overcome their differences on output
levels and reach a new agreement. The agreement already has been
extended once _ from last December until this month _ because the
13 OPEC members could not reach a new pact.
   One OPEC faction wants to cut production to push weak oil prices
higher. Another _ including Saudi Arabia _ wants to increase
production or at least maintain it at current levels to take
advantage of an expected increase in demand in the second half of
the year.
   ``It comes down to the Saudis and their allies are not
interested in doing anything to shore up the price of oil,'' said
Peter Beutel, an assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   Oil prices fell in reaction to developments at the meeting
because ``the market has been disappointed by the opportunities
lost,'' Beutel said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Ruling Gives Banks Limited Underwriting Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Major banks are applauding the Supreme Court's ruling that banks
can use subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in some securities as
another step toward their industry's expansion into lucrative
investment banking.
   Some banking companies, including Bankers Trust New York Corp.
and Chemical New York Corp., said Monday that they planned to take
advantage of their new underwriting powers before the end of the
week. Others, such as Chase Manhattan Corp., said they would begin
operations some time this summer.
   The Supreme Court's ruling Monday upheld a lower court decision
permitting banks to use subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in
municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-related securities and commercial
paper, a form of short-term corporate IOU.
   The Federal Reserve Board had granted such powers to seven of
the nation's biggest banks, but restricted the activity to no more
than 5 percent to 10 percent of the subsidary's gross revenue. That
action was appealed by the Securities Industry Association.
   In its decision, the Supreme Court let stand an appeals court
ruling four months ago that such activity did not violate the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.
   The law, passed by Congress in the wake of the 1929 stock market
crash, was aimed primarily at protecting the financial stability of
banks by restricting them from speculating in stocks and bonds.
   Congressional legislation is pending to repeal parts of the law.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., said the court's decision
would not deter the House banking committee, which he chairs, from
legislating such ground rules.
   ``A majority of the banking committee ... feel that it is a
mistake to alllow the future structure of the financial community
to be decided by the regulatory agencies and the courts,'' St
Germain said in a statement released Monday by his office.
   Charles Pistor, president of the American Bankers Association,
said Monday's ruling displayed ``another hole in the
anti-competitive Glass-Steagall Act and another important victory
for consumers. But, before large numbers of bank customers will
benefit, we need to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act and allow all
banks to offer securities services.''
   SIA President Edward I. O'Brien said his group was disappointed
by the decision. ``But we are pleased the Federal Reserve itself
has erected a series of firewalls ... to prevent banks from taking
excessive risks within the securities arena which would further
weaken banks and thus endanger the nation's economy,'' he said.
   In other Supreme Court decisions Monday, the justices:
   _Let stand a ruling that allows states indirectly to tax
interest paid to banks and other financial institutions from
investments in Federal Home Loan Bank bonds.
   _Ruled unanimously the government may be forced to pay damages
when a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to
prevent.
   _Barred states from banning all direct mail advertisements sent
by lawyers to potential clients.
   _Ruled the Postal Service was similar to a private business and
must pay interest on back pay owed to a Chesterfield, Mo., worker
who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal discrimination.
   _Ruled that companies may violate antitrust law when they lobby
private organizations that play a prominent role in influencing
business legislation. _Struck down a federal antitrust lawsuit by
actor Paul Newman and director George Roy Hill over profits from
video cassette sales and rentals.

<HEAD>Icahn Says He Has Put $310.2 Million In Escrow To Cover Texaco Bid
Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl C. Icahn says he has put $310.2 million
into an escrow account to be divided among Texaco Inc. shareholders
if he fails to come up with financing for his $60-per-share offer
to buy the company.
   At its White Plains, N.Y., headquarters, the nation's
third-largest oil company reacted skeptically to the action Monday
by its biggest shareholder, saying Icahn had ``been caught
red-handed giving the Texaco shareholder false and misleading
information.''
   ``Given the number of strings and conditions that remain
attached to this money, it doesn't matter to the Texaco shareholder
what account Icahn puts it in,'' Texaco stated. ``He can move it
from one pocket to another as much as he wants _ we are still
convinced it will never get to Texaco shareholders.''
   Icahn also said he had sent a signed ``bare bones'' $60 a share
merger agreement to the company.
   ``If Texaco executes the merger agreement, we will terminate our
proxy contest and withdraw our slate of nominees,'' the statement
said, referring to Icahn's attempt to elect himself and four
colleagues to Texaco's board of directors.
   Texaco has said repeatedly it was not interested in Icahn's
advances.
   Texaco's stock slid $1.37{ to $50.50 a share Monday in
consolidated nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
issues. It has remained in the $50-per-share range since Icahn
launched his bid last month.
   Icahn has offered to pay $12.4 billion for the 207 million
Texaco shares he does not already own. He paid about $1.2 billion
for his existing stake of about 36 million shares. The offer puts a
value of $14.6 billion on the oil company.
   But Texaco has refused to put Icahn's buyout offer to a
shareholder vote, prompting him to field the slate of five
candidates for Texaco' 14-member board. Icahn has said he wants the
seats on Texaco's board so he can pressure it into putting his
offer before the shareholders.
   The proxy fight deadline is Friday, when Texaco holds its annual
meeting in Tulsa, Okla.
   Originally, Icahn offered to put $100 million in escrow to ease
market suspicions that he could not come up with the money actually
to buy the company.
   Last week, Icahn increased the guarantee to $300 million, and
promised it would be distributed directly to Texaco shareholders,
instead of the company treasury, if he failed to get financing.
   Icahn's statement that $310,201,955 in cash was placed in escrow
with Fleet National Bank of Providence, R.I. _ $1.50 per share for
all Texaco stockholders eligible to vote on the special meeting he
is seeking _ apparently was designed to stifle Texaco's criticism
that he was unlikely ever to have to pay the money.
   Icahn said the escrow would be forfeited if, at the time of the
special stockholders meeting to vote on his offer, the financing
was not in place.
   He said the escrow would not be forfeited if by the time of the
meeting another entity made a legitimate bid for more than $60 per
share, or if the Internal Revenue Service failed to give required
approval to Icahn's proposal.
   Icahn said Friday he was forming a new holding company to act as
his sole vehicle for acquisitions, including a possible hostile
takeover bid for Texaco. He said the holding company intended to
raise up to $3.25 billion through an offering of stock and debt
securities.
   Icahn stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the
Texaco board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer, he
would consider making a hostile bid for it through the new holding
company at yet to be determined terms.

<HEAD>New Business Startups Fall 6.6 Percent in 7th Quarterly Drop</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Business Starts-States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A continuing decline in the number of U.S.
business starts reflects the nation's changing economic profile and
not necessarily broad economic problems, according to a business
information concern.
   The number of new domestic businesses declined by 6.6 percent to
53,382 in the first three months of the year _ the seventh straight
quarterly drop _ from 57,158 in first quarter 1987, according to
Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
   Dun & Bradstreet officials cited the maturing of the nation's
economic expansion, now in its sixth year, and a shift from
consumerism to export-driven growth as factors in the decline of
business starts, a barometer of economic activity and money-making
opportunities.
   Joseph W. Duncan, Dun & Bradstreet's corporate economist and
chief statistician, said new retailing businesses fell because of
expectations that consumer demand will weaken, and startups of new
service businesses fell in response to increased competition and
corporate budget reductions.
   Retailing and service concerns account for about half of all new
businesses.
   ``While the current surge in U.S. exports will create new
business opportunities in some sectors, existing manufacturers are
the primary beneficiaries,'' Duncan said in a report of the latest
figures.
   Business starts are considered important because they signal the
level of entrepreneurial activity and perceived opportunities for
profit in local area markets. But a persistent decline in starts
does not necessarily indicate a broader economic problem, said Reid
Gearhart, a Dun & Bradstreet spokesman.
   ``With the recovery in its sixth year, that's just having a
dampening effect,'' he said. ``It's not really a negative.''
   Dun & Bradstreet data indicated first-quarter business starts
fell in seven of the nine major industry sectors. The largest
decrease came in the finance-insurance-real estate category, which
fell 9.8 percent. Retail business starts dropped 8.1 percent and
services fell 5.7 percent.
   Starts also fell in the construction, manufacturing, wholesale
and transportation sectors, with decreases of between 5 percent and
8 percent.
   Increases were in agriculture, up 11.5 percent, and mining, up
2.3 percent.
   ``Both mining, which includes oil and gas extraction businesses,
and agriculture appear to be turning the corner after several years
of severe stress,'' Duncan said.
   Despite a drop in manufacturing-related business starts, there
was evidence that export growth was encouraging some entrepreneurs,
Duncan said. An analysis of manufacturing starts showed significant
increases among motor vehicle and equipment makers, metal producers
and office equipment manufacturers.
   Geographically, first-quarter starts fell nationwide, with the
largest decreases in the Rocky Mountain states, down 15.6 percent.
Other significant drops occurred in the Middle Atlantic states,
down 12.2 percent, and the West North Central states, down 12
percent.
   Starts in New England dropped only 1.1 percent, while starts in
the South Atlantic and East North Central states were both down 3.3
percent. Starts fell 3.8 percent in the Pacific states, 6.7 percent
in East South Central states and 6.3 percent in West South Central
states.
   Dun & Bradstreet describes itself as the world's largest
marketer of business information and related services, with revenue
of $3.4 billion in 1987.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the government's latest auction, with
three-month securities unchanged and the six-month rate down
slightly.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.44 percent on Monday, identical to
last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.67 percent, down from 6.72 percent last
week.
   The rate on three-month bills this week and last was the lowest
since these bills sold for 6.53 percent on May 3. The rate on
six-month bills was the lowest since May 16, when they averaged 6.5
percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.64 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,837.20 and 7.0 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,662.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages dropped to 7.46 percent last
week from 7.59 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Financial Markets Brace For Bad News On Trade Deficit Today</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government is trying to tame the wide
swings in the monthly U.S. trade deficit, changes which in the past
have sent stock prices plunging, but analysts are not sure the
effortwill be a success.
   Financial markets were braced for more bad news today with
release of the trade deficit for April. In advance of the report,
many economists were predicting the deficit could widen to around
$12.3 billion, compared to a March deficit of $11.9 billion.
   The last time the trade deficit widened, when the February
figure was reported, the dollar came under intense selling pressure
worldwide and the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 101 points,
its fifth-worst loss ever.
   Analysts didn't expect such a dramatic reaction to this report,
mainly because financial markets already were expecting the April
deficit to be higher. However, if it came in much higher than the
expected $12.3 billion, it had the potential to set off alarms in
financial markets.
   For the first time in two years, the government has begun
seasonally adjusting the monthly deficit figures to take into
account normal seasonal changes in shipping patterns.
   Most government statistics are adjusted to factor out
fluctuations which occur on a seasonal basis, such as the normal
rise in retail sales right before Christmas.
   The government was forced to abandon seasonal adjustments of the
trade figures in December 1985 because of lags in gathering the
data. Those problems have since been corrected and seasonal
adjustments are being re-introduced.
   By adjusting for normal seasonal swings, the government hopes to
make the trade series less erratic and therefore ease the jolt
financial markets sometimes receive.
   A string of bad monthly trade figures was blamed for adding to
the pessimistic mood right before last October's stock market crash
and there have been other periodic jolts, including the big drop in
the stock market after the February deficit figure was released.
   But Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said he did
not believe the seasonal adjustments will do much to smooth out the
monthly swings because of the erratic nature of trade shipments,
when any single month can be affected by a number of factors.
   In fact, one reason analysts were looking for a wider deficit
figure in April was the absence of gold shipments to Taiwan. In
March, the Taiwan government purchased over $700 million in gold as
a way of lowering its trade surplus with the United States, which
has been pressuring Taiwan to do more to open up its country to
American goods.
   Even with erratic month-to-month swings, economists are
optimistic that the overall trade deficit, which hit a record
$170.3 billion, is finally headed lower.
   ``The trade deficit is slowly turning and that should be the
story for the rest of the year,'' Sinai said.
   A recent survey by the National Association of Business
Economists showed they expect the trade defict to decline to around
$150 billion this year and $125 billion in 1989.

   OPEC ministers reached agreement today to
extend their existing oil output pact for six months but failed to
take any further steps aimed at limiting production and boosting
prices.
   Venezuelan oil minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, disclosing
the agreement to reporters at the 13-nation cartel's regular
midyear meeting, said ``we think the market will have a good
perception of what we have done.''
   Nevertheless, the agreement confirmed widespread speculation
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wouldn't
agree on significant new moves to cut the world supply of oil.
Prices are now substantially below OPEC's $18-per-barrel objective.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer of
prices, the July contract for West Texas Intermediate crude fell 30
cents Monday to close at $16.43 a barrel, partly in anticipation of
the OPEC agreement reached today.
   The ministers, who began their conference on Saturday, gathered
to decide whether to change the agreement among 12 of the producers
that limits output to 15.06 million barrels a day.
   Delegation sources said the ministers had haggled over whether
to extend the accord by three months or six months. The accord was
to have expired June 30.
   High-level sources in several delegations, speaking on condition
of anonymity earlier, said a majority of the OPEC ministers had
favored the shorter extension. But the minority, favoring the
longer extension, included influential Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest
producer.
   Analysts had said the prospect of yet another extension
highlighted OPEC's inability to overcome its differences on
production levels and agree on a common formula to raise prices.
   One OPEC faction has wanted to cut production to push prices up
to the target level. The Saudi-led minority has wanted to increase
production or at least maintain it at current levels to take
advantage of an increase in demand expected in the second half of
the year and to maintain OPEC's market share.
   Iraq refused to sign the current accord because it wants a quota
equal to that of Iran, with which it has been at war since 1980.
OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said it was
unlikely Iraq would participate in the latest agreement.
   Lukman said Monday that the ministers were working hard on a
compromise to bring Iraq back into the fold.
   Iran has a daily production quota of 2.369 million barrels.
Iraq, which previously had a quota of 1.54 million barrels a day,
is producing 2.6 million barrels daily.
   Success on that front would lower Iraq's production, which could
help boost oil prices.
   The United Arab Emirates' oil minister, Mana Saeed Oteiba, left
the talks on Sunday. He said he needed to consult with his
government and might or might not return, although he left the rest
of the UAE delegation behind.
   Hernandez, however, said it was likely Otgiba would return today
to sign the rollover agreement.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Why Is Bud On Top?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Beer Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>

   While most beer companies grapple with a
stagnant market, Anheuser-Busch Inc. is soaking up customers and
leaving some observers scratching their heads.
   ``That's the $64 question,'' said Frank Walters, research
director for M. Shanken Communications in New York which publishes
beverage industry magazines.
   Since the beginning of the decade, Anheuser has raised its share
of the market from 28 percent to nearly 40 percent largely due to
growth in Budweiser sales, which have bubbled from 35 million
barrels in 1980 to 50 million last year.
   The answers given for the company's success range from superior
marketing and management to high quality products to other factors
that are less tangible.
   For example, Budweiser appears to succeed in getting consumers
at an early age and keeping them, said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst
with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   If beer customers want to try a different brand, and that
product happens to be unavailable, then the consumers most commonly
choose a Budweiser, analysts say.
   ``It's become everybody's No. 2 brand,'' said John Collopy, who
follows the beer industry and is president of the Milwaukee
investment firm, Cleary Gull Reiland McDevitt & Collopy Inc.
   Robert Weinberg, a St. Louis analyst who is a former Anheuser
executive, said some of the brewer's successful strategies emerged
after the company was bruised by its current main competitor,
Miller Brewing Co. in Milwaukee.
   Weinberg said Miller was first to use the marketing technique of
putting the consumer at the center of an ad, with the Miller High
Life slogan: ``If you've got the time, we've got the beer.''
   ``It had Anheuser-Busch spinning through 1975,'' Weinberg said,
and Miller was able to eat away much of Anheuser's lead.
   But Anheuser, he said, responded with its own consumer-oriented
slogan, ``This Bud's for you,'' which helped the company recapture
its momentum.
   John MacDonough, vice president of brand management at Anheuser,
said advertising alone cannot carry a product.
   ``All I can say is that the consumer is very sensitive,'' he
said. ``No amount of marketing could keep a product going if you
don't have a good product.''
   Analysts also note that Budweiser has been protected from the
discount beer battles of Miller and Stroh Brewery Co. by using the
Busch brand as a shield.
   But it might be difficult to maintain Budweiser's growth as
Anheuser ventures more into the low-calorie beer market, MacDonough
said.
   After the light beer market opened up, Anheuser made a stab with
Natural Light, which has not taken off like its counterpart, Lite
beer at Miller.
   But Anheuser introduced Bud Light in the early 1980s, and while
the brand has not challenged Lite in terms of volume, its sales
have had double-digit growth each of the past two years.
   MacDonough acknowledged that Anheuser officials were reluctant
to enter the light beer market with the Budweiser name for fear
that it would eat away Budweiser sales similar to what has happened
at other companies.
   ``We don't like to give people as good a head start as we gave
Lite,'' he said. ``What's unusual is that we've gained that
terrific growth (with Bud Light) and have still grown with
Budweiser.''
   One of the few areas where Anheuser has had problems is with its
super-premium Michelob line, which, according to Goldman's
estimates, has lost an estimated 20 percent since the beginning of
the decade.
   But he noted Michelob sales probably were hurt by a strong
dollar, which allowed imported beers to hold down their prices. Now
that the dollar has weakened against other currencies, he said,
Michelob's erosion might subside.
   Anheuser also has had success selling its beer overseas through
exporting and licensing agreements.

   The stock market held at sharply higher levels
today after surging on a better-than-expected trade report that
worked to ease inflation fears.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 31.82 points to
2,131.22, its highest level since the October market crash, by
midafternoon.
   Trading was active. Volume on the Big Board came to 170.23
million shares. Gainers led losers by about 3 to 1 with 1,133 up,
396 down and 405 unchanged at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices surged at the opening on a long-awaited Commerce
Department report which showed the nation's seasonally adjusted
trade deficit narrowed to $9.89 billion in April, far below the
$12-plus billion market watchers had been anticipating.
   It was the lowest trade imbalance since December 1984.
   The report also sparked a rally in the bond market, where the
bellwether 30-year Treasury issue was up more than $17 per $1,000
in face value at midday. The dollar also moved sharply higher
against the major currencies.
   One trader said the market was ``feeding off the effect the
(trade) number has on inflation.''
   Analysts noted that the markets embraced the trade report
because it showed a decline in exports, which eased by 2.5 percent
and worked to dispel concerns that the economy is overheating.
Imports declined by 6.4 percent in April.
   Last month, although the government's March deficit figures also
were better than expected, a surge in both imports and exports
replaced investors' enthusiasm with fears of inflation.
   ``If exports are surging, the economy is surging and inflation
is surging,'' noted Larry Wachtel, first vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The Dow had been flirting with the 2,100 mark for weeks. ``But
we've broken out of that much-publicized resistance level,'' one
trader said.
   Analysts noted that a lot of cash still remains on the
sidelines. ``Portfolio managers are getting `performance anxiety'
fears because they've got a lot of cash,'' one trader noted. ``A
lot of it is going into bonds and equities.''
   Among actively traded issues, IBM jumped 2] to 119], Ford Motor
was up 1] at 52}, Exxon was up 1 at 46~, and Motorola was up 1\ at
51~.
   Philip Morris, a component of the Dow, was off 1| at 83], and
RJR Nabisco was off 1\ at 46}. Tobacco stocks were expected to come
under pressure after a jury in New Jersey on Monday ordered a
tobacco company to pay damages for the death of a smoker.
   Texaco was up \ at 50}. Traders were curious about who purchased
a block of about 7.7 million Texaco shares that traded hands early
in the session.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.85 to 154.87. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.05 at 309.19.

<HEAD>London Share Prices Jump As U.S. Trade Gap Narrows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices ended sharply higher Tuesday on the
London Stock Exchange following a surge on Wall Street that stemmed
from a better-than-expected U.S. trade report for April.
   The U.S. government said the trade deficit shrank to a
seasonally adjusted $9.89 billion from a revised gap of $11.7
billion in March. The April shortfall was the lowest since December
1984 and about $3 billion down from what many economists had
predicted.
   Wall Street fired ahead from the opening bell, with the closely
watched Dow Jones industrial average up about 30 points to the
2,129 level as the London session neared its close.
   In response, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
ended up 27.4 points, or 1.49 percent, at 1,866.2. Trading volume
was a moderate 472.8 million shares, compared with Monday's 316.2
million.
   Brokers said dollar-dependent international issues were boosted
by a stronger U.S. currency.
   Among the few losers was Consolidated Gold Fields, which fell 10
pence to 10.48 pounds. Dealers said investors took profits and
unloaded their shares as inflation worries began to evaporate.

<HEAD>IBM To Accept Old PCs As Trade-Ins For New Models</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. confirmed
Tuesday it plans to accept its old XT and AT model personal
computers as trade-ins for discounts on its new Personal System-2
line.
   The trade-in program is apparently intended to hasten the
acceptance of the Personal System-2 line _ introduced in April 1987
_ as a new industry standard.
   Although PS-2 sales have been healthy, there is still strong
demand for computers built to the old standard, such as the XT, the
AT and compatible models made by such companies as Compaq Computer
Corp. and Tandy Corp.
   IBM spokesman Scott Brooks said the promotion was still in the
planning stages and it was too soon to give details.
   IBM dealers were informed of the promotion in recent weeks, Info
World, a weekly newspaper on personal computers, reported in its
Monday edition.
   ``This is going to be an excellent program, something IBM has
never offered before,'' Richard Rose, president of Dataflex Corp.
in Edison, N.J., told the newspaper.

<HEAD>Stocks and Dollar Jump, Interest Rates Drop In Response to Trade
Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors scooped up U.S. securities and dollars
Tuesday in response to a surprise plunge in the trade deficit that
diluted inflation fears, depressed interest rates and sent the
stock market to a post-crash high.
   ``I don't think it's an overreaction. It's a very positive
development,'' said Thom R. Brown, chairman of the investment
policy committee at the Philadelphia-based brokerage Butcher &
Singer Inc.
   A government report that the April trade deficit shrank to $9.89
billion startled many economists and investment strategists who had
expected a much larger number.
   The shrinkage reflected a big drop in America's appetite for
imports and a lesser decline in exports, key concerns of those who
fear the economy is too strong and much higher inflation is
inevitable.
   The impact was immediately felt in the foreign-exchange markets,
where surging demand for dollars strengthened the currency's value
relative to the Japanese yen, West German mark and British pound.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy, prices
of the 30-year Treasury bill soared more than $20 per $1,000 in
face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and is an
important signal of interest rate trends, tumbled to 8.81 percent,
its lowest level in two months.
   The bond-market rally overflowed into Wall Street, where stock
prices advanced strongly and sent some key indices to their highest
closing levels since the the October crash.
   Volume was heavy, an indication that more investors have been
lured back to the market after a prolonged period of apathy and
cynicism about stocks.
   ``The interesting thing I've seen today is that individual
investors are calling to see what stocks we like,'' said Peter A.
Karos, manager of equity and over-the-counter trading at Piper,
Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis. ``That's the first time I've
seen that for months. It's very encouraging.''
   Nevertheless, some strategists were cautious about interpreting
the monthly trade number, which historically has been unpredictable
and subject to major revisions. They said the markets were simply
overlooking other evidence of impending inflation, such as higher
commodity prices and low unemployment.
   ``I'm somewhat concerned overall because even though
statistically we don't see the kind of inflation we saw in the late
1970s, we're possibly building a fairly good springboard for
inflation,'' said Jack Barbanel, a futures trader at Gruntal & Co.
in New York. ``The market is ignoring it.''
   Stephen B. Timbers, executive vice president and chief
investment officer at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said
the trade deficit number showed definite improvement but he also
expressed skepticism about its significance.
   ``We will undoubtedly have a disappointing figure in the next
couple of months,'' he said. ``These numbers swing all over the
place.''
   Even some strategists who were more positive about the trade
number saw some long-term danger lurking because it signaled a
possible end to an economic boom in Japan, a key U.S. trading
partner that largely relies on the American market for its
export-oriented economy.
   If that happened, the roaring Japanese stock market could
tumble, setting off a powerful reverberation through other markets
worldwide, especially in the United States.
   ``I don't think investors are paying any attention to this,
which might come back and bite them,'' said Brown of Butcher &
Singer. ``The Japanese market is so grossly overvalued, it could
come down fast and hard.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar leaped in value against most major
foreign currencies Tuesday in reaction to a report that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit narrowed in April to a
better-than-expected $9.89 billion.
   Gold prices finished mixed after initially being knocked down by
the trade news. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was
bid at $450.15 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $449.70 late
Monday.
   In its strongest move in months, the dollar climbed 1.6 percent
against the West German mark although West Germany's central bank
sold dollars in an attempt to stem the U.S. currency's rise,
traders said.
   The dollar also rose 1.7 percent against the British pound and
by slightly less against other European currencies and the Japanese
yen. It slipped against the Canadian dollar, in part because a
strong bond rally lowered yields on U.S. securities in comparison
to Canadian securities.
   Traders said there were no confirmed reports of dollar selling
by central banks other than West Germany's.
   Many traders had expected the April merchandise trade deficit to
be about $12.2 billion. Instead, the gap proved to be the lowest
since December 1984.
   ``The statistics were quite a shock to the marketplace,'' said
Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
   Witten said some traders concluded the United States would be
able to trade its way out of its deficit, although he said, ``I
think it's too early to say that.''
   West Germany's intervention briefly suppressed the dollar's
rise, but the currency rebounded and finished the session at its
highs of the day, said Jeff Mondschein, vice president and foreign
exchange manager for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   In London, the dollar strengthened to $1.7925 to the pound from
$1.8165 on Monday. Later in New York, the dollar strengthened to
$1.7864 to the pound from $1.8165 late Monday.
   Before the announcement of the trade figures, the dollar closed
at 125.05 Japanese yen in Tokyo, down from 125.19 Monday. In London
the dollar traded at 126.20 yen. At the end of the trading day in
New York, the dollar rose to 126.55 yen from 125.12 yen late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7496 West German marks, up from 1.7227; 1.4626
Swiss francs, up from 1.4408; 1.2183 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2208; 1,297.50 Italian lire, up from 1,280.25; and 5.8970 French
francs, up from 5.8125.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with Monday's late rates,
included: 1.7460 West German marks, up from 1.7241; 1.4615 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4424; 5.8840 French francs, up from 5.7265;
1.9600 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9345; 1,292.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,281.75; and 1.2162 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2203.
   Gold dropped about $4 an ounce immediately after the release of
the trade numbers, but recovered toward the end of the day in
reaction to strength in oil prices and commodity indexes, said
Brian Donohue, a trader for Midland Montagu Metals in New York.
   In Hong Kong, where the market closed before the release of the
U.S. trade numbers, gold closed at a bid $452.58, down from $457.99.
   The late gold bid price in London was $448 a troy ounce, down
from $449 an ounce late Monday. The late bid price in Zurich was
also $448 an ounce, down from $448.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $450.60 a troy ounce from $449.60 an ounce late
Monday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.91 a troy
ounce, down from $7.02 an ounce. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $7.040 a troy ounce from
$7.025 an ounce late Monday.

   Stocks hit a post-crash high Tuesday after
rallying hard on a better-than-expected trade report, but a late
wave of profit-taking prevented the market from posting even
sharper gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been up more
than 38 points during the session, finished at 2,124.47, up 25.07.
Broader market indices also closed at post-crash highs.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,091 issues up, 432 down and 466 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 227.15 million shares,
up sharply from 125.31 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
261.597 million shares.
   Analysts were impressed with the market's performance. ``It was
a good show, and the best is yet to come,'' said Michael Metz, a
vice president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., noting
that ``there's still room on the upside.''
   Stock prices surged at the opening on a long-awaited Commerce
Department report that showed the nation's seasonally adjusted
trade deficit narrowed to $9.89 billion in April, far below the
$12-plus billion market watchers had been anticipating.
   The report also sparked a rally in the bond market and helped
push the dollar higher against the major currencies.
   Analysts noted that the markets embraced the trade report
because it showed a decline in exports, which eased by 2.5 percent
and worked to dispel concerns that the economy is expanding too
quickly. Imports declined by 6.4 percent in April.
   ``The trade figures suggest the consumer boom is slackening but
manufacturing activity is rising, which is ideal,'' said Metz, who
predicted ``a soft landing from fears of inflation and an
overheated economy.''
   The Dow average, which had been flirting with the 2,100 mark for
weeks, decisively pierced that point at the opening, and traders
watched closely as the key index ticked past incremental barriers.
The buying spree was broad-based throughout the session.
   ``The blue chips basked in all this strength, but there is
greater growth and percentage opportunities in the
medium-capitalization stocks, and they also performed well,'' noted
Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia.
   While cash that had been sitting on the sidelines for weeks
poured into the market, analysts noted that the enthusiasm had some
bounds.
   ``There's still a lot of skeptics in the background, which is a
bullish phenomenon in and of itself,'' Metz said.
   Among actively traded issues, IBM rose 1} to 118}, Ford Motor
was up 1[ at 52{, Matsushita was up 3| at 211[, Dow Chemical was up
2~ at 90, and Digital Equipment was up 1] at 113{.

47. Tobacco stocks were expected to come under pressure after a
jury in New Jersey on Monday ordered a tobacco company to pay
damages for the death of a smoker.
   Texaco was down [ at 50]. Traders were curious about who
purchased a block of about 7.7 million Texaco shares that traded
hands early in the session.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $24.197 billion, or
0.90 percent, in value.
   The NYSE index was up 1.50 at 154.52.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 3.18 to 317.10,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.87 at 274.30.

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $9.89 billion
in April, its best showing in more than three years, the government
said Tuesday in a better-than-expected report which sparked a big
rally on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department said that the April deficit narrowed by
15.5 percent from a seasonally adjusted March deficit figure of
$11.70 billion, with all of the improvement coming from a steep
drop in imports.
   The trade figure, which has often rattled world financial
markets, was greeted as exceptionally good news by investors, who
rushed to bid up the price of U.S. stocks and bonds. They also sent
the value of the dollar surging on foreign exchange markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 25.07 points to
close at 2,124.47, a post-crash high.
   Many economists had been braced for a widening of the deficit to
around $12.2 billion based on an assumption that exports could not
hold at the record level set in March. Exports did edge down by 2.5
percent, but the small drop still left them at $26.22 billion, the
second highest level on record.
   Meanwhile, imports plunged 6.4 percent to $36.11 billion,
reflecting big drops in American purchases of foreign cars and
capital equipment, including computers.
   Private analysts said the string of better trade numbers
virtually assured that President Reagan would win his veto battle
with Congress over trade legislation.
   ``The argument for protectionism is fast disappearing as our
trade deficit improves,'' said Frank McCormick, senior economist
with Bank of America.
   For the first four months of the year, the trade deficit has
been running at an annual rate of $141.8 billion, a big improvement
from the record $170.3 billion deficit suffered in 1987.
   While many economists had been expecting a decline to around
$150 billion, some said they were now revising their forecasts to
show even more of an improvement this year.
   Zaharo Sofianou, senior economist for the Boston Co. Economic
Advisers, said she believed the trade deficit would dip to between
$130 billion and $140 billion this year as exports continue to lead
overall U.S. economic growth.
   For the past year, American manufacturers have been enjoying an
export boom as a weaker dollar has made their products competitive
again on overseas markets.
   The trade report came at a particularly good time for President
Reagan, who will depart Sunday for his eighth and final economic
summit in Toronto. The administration hopes to use the summit as a
forum to promote Reagan's free-market philosophy and cement gains
made in the past three years on closer international cooperation.
   The April improvement gave the country its first single-digit
trade deficit since a $9.90 billion imbalance in August 1985. It
was the lowest imbalance since an $8.03 billion deficit in December
1984.
   The March deficit was originally reported as a single-digit
figure as well at $9.7 billion. But that was before the department
made adjustments for normal seasonal fluctuations. Beginning with
the April report, these adjustments will be made on a monthly basis
in an effort to smooth out erratic month-to-month swings which have
often sent financial markets into a tailspin.
   A higher-than-expected February report sent the dollar plunging
and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down by 101 points, its
fifth worst loss ever, and bad trade numbers last fall were blamed
for contributing to market anxiety before the Oct. 19 stock market
crash.
   The April improvement in imports reflected an 8 percent drop in
foreign purchases of capital goods, including computers. Shipments
of foreign cars and parts fell 4.6 percent while purchases of other
foreign consumer goods dropped 7 percent.
   ``I think we have reached the high-water mark on imports and we
will see gradual declines from now on,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Oil imports rose in April by 3.5 percent to $3.35 billion.
   The 2.5 percent drop in exports represented small declines in a
number of areas which were offset in part by a 0.5 percent rise in
food sales, which climbed to $2.59 billion.
   The country's largest trade deficit, as usual, was with Japan,
an imbalance of $4.44 billion, down slightly from a March deficit
of $4.55 billion.
   The trade deficit with Western Europe continued to decline,
dropping to $812.3 million in April. The deficit with Canada,
America's largest trading partner, edged down to $1.08 billion,
compared to $1.14 billion in March.
   The country-by-country totals, unlike the other figures, are not
adjusted for seasonal variations.
   Before adjusting for seasonal factors, the April trade deficit
would have been $9.78 billion, 1.1 percent below the seasonally
adjusted figure of $9.89 billion.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shrinks, Markets Rally, Auto Sales Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial markets rallied powerfully Tuesday in response to a
stunning drop in the U.S. monthly trade deficit, oil prices rose
after OPEC extended a production pact, and American automakers
reported lower sales for early June.
   The biggest economic news was the Commerce Department's report
that the April trade deficit shrank to $9.89 billion, the best
showing in more than three years.
   Many economists had expected a wider deficit, assuming exports
would not not sustain high levels and imports would surge. But
exports declined only slightly and imports plunged, dampening fears
that the economy is growing too rapidly and acute inflation is
inevitable.
   The news was greeted enthusiastically in the dollar, bond and
stock markets. The dollar leaped in value against most major
foreign currencies, rising 1.7 percent against the British pound,
1.6 percent against the West German mark and 1.1 percent against
the Japanese yen.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates, the
key 30-year Treasury issue jumped more than $20 per $1,000 in face
amount and its yield fell to 8.81 percent, the lowest point in two
months.
   The bond rally spilled into stocks, where prices surged and the
key Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.07 points to 2,124.47, its
highest close since the October crash. Broader market barometers
also hit post-crash highs.
   Elsewhere, oil prices rose after the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries decided to prolong an output-restraint pact
until the end of the year.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil, rose 40 cents to
settle at $16.83 per 42-gallon barrel.
   In other economic news, major automakers said sales of
domestically built cars and light trucks fell 4.1 percent in early
June from last year's levels for the same period.
   But industry analysts attributed the decline largely to buying
incentives last year that inflated sales. They said that 1988
spring sales have held steady and consumer confidence remains
strong.
   Car sales were down for all domestic makers except Toyota Motor
Corp., which was just beginning U.S. production last year, and
Mazda Motor Corp., which began U.S. production in September.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Soar On Drought-Damage Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices soared the maximum allowed for daily trading
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as long-range weather
forecasts fanned fears of drought damage to the U.S. corn crop.
Other grain and soybean futures also advanced.
   On other markets, energy futures posted steep gains; Treasury
bond futures and stock-index futures rose sharply; livestock and
meat were lower; copper plunged; and precious metals rose.
   The National Weather Service's forecast for warmer- and
drier-than-normal conditions in the Midwest through mid-July was
the main factor driving corn prices higher, analysts said.
   Until this week, the dramatic rise in corn futures prices was
mainly speculative since a soaking rain could have restored almost
all of the crop to full health.
   But the lack of moisture has now begun taking a real toll on the
corn crop, despite scattered showers Tuesday in parts of Minnesota,
Iowa and Wisconsin, said Katharina Zimmer, a wheat and corn analyst
with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   ``Everybody knows that this is the week when we start doing
damage to the corn crops in many important growing areas,'' she
said. ``This is the week when we really start taking off bushels.''
   Contracts for delivery of corn in July, September, December and
March all advanced their daily limit of 10 cents a bushel.
   The oat and spring wheat crops have already sustained severe
drought damage and experts say the soybean crop will suffer if the
dry spell continues into July.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.74 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents to 10 cents
higher with July at $2.69{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to 7\
cents higher with July at $2.69\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged
to 14{ cents higher with July at $8.90 a bushel.
   Oil futures surged following reports that OPEC ministers had
agreed to extend their existing oil output pact for six months, but
some analysts were at a loss to explain the market's reaction.
   Futures prices had fallen sharply during the past week in
anticipation of just such an agreement. Peter Beutel, an analyst in
New York with Elders Futures Inc., said he didn't know whether the
jump in prices signaled a major turnaround in market sentiment or
was merely an upward blip in a downward trend.
   ``I feel a little like a detective who knows there's a dead body
here and who's looking for a murder weapon and a motive,'' he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 38 cents to 42 cents
higher with July at $16.83 cents a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent
to .59 cent higher with July at 44.32 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .88 cent to 1.13 cents higher with July at 49.53 cents
a gallon.
   The government's report of an unexpected narrowing of the U.S.
trade deficit to $9.89 billion gave Treasury bond futures a boost
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The dollar's stronger showing against other major currencies
also supported Treasury bond futures, analysts said.
   June Treasury bonds settled 1 29-32 higher at 90 16-32.
   Stock-index futures markets also registered optimism in the wake
of the trade-deficit report. The contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
settled 2.90 points higher at 274.60.
   Pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange _ with
frozen pork bellies down sharply for the sixth straight day _ on
slack retail demand for pork products, low cash hog prices and
concerns about abundant supplies of pork bellies in cold storage,
analysts said.
   Live cattle futures were mostly lower on weak cash markets. A
sharper drop in feeder cattle futures prices reflected concern
about the rising cost of feed grains, said Thomas Morgan, president
of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .27 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June
at 71.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .65 cent to 1 cent lower
with August at 73.27 cents a pound; hogs were 1.05 cents lower to
.43 cent higher with June at 50.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1 cent to 1.88 cents lower with July at 46.47 cents a
pound.
   Copper futures prices fell steeply on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, reflecting improved availability of the metal, analysts
said. Copper for June delivery settled 3.65 cents lower at $1.085 a
pound.
   Gold and silver futures posted slight gains in reaction to
higher grain and energy futures prices.
   Gold settled 20 cents to $1 higher with August at $454.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1.5 cents higher with July at $7.07 a
troy ounce.

   Federal prosecutors are seeking a
``substantial'' prison sentence for the former head of Beech-Nut
Corp., who was convicted of distributing phony apple juice for
babies, according to court papers filed Tuesday.
   Former Beech-Nut Chief Executive Neils Hoyvald, 54, was found
guilty in February of 351 counts of violating the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act. Each count carries a maximum sentence of three years
in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   He and his co-defendant, John Lavery, a former Beech-Nut vice
president, are scheduled for sentencing Thursday in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn.
   The government has urged U.S. District Judge Thomas Platt to
impose a ``substantial'' prison sentence for Hoyvald because he has
not shown remorse and because he allegedly gave false testimony,
according to a response letter from Hoyvald's attorney, Brendan
Sullivan Jr., who said the arguments had no merit.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Roche said the government's
pre-sentencing memorandum would not be made public until the day of
sentencing.
   Sullivan has asked that Hoyvald be spared a prison term and that
he instead receive probation and community service or home
detention.
   In his pre-sentencing memo, Sullivan suggested that Hoyvald
could lecture to business students so they could learn from his
mistakes.
   ``Mr. Hoyvald has been branded as a convicted felon and will
bear the stigma of his convictions for as long as he lives,''
Sullivan said in his letter. ``This prosecution has already `sent a
message' to the food industry that economic adulteration will not
be overlooked and may result in criminal liability.''
   Hoyvald and Lavery were charged in an indictment that accused
Beech-Nut of shipping adulterated and misbranded juice made from
phony concentrate throughout the United States and overseas from
1978 to 1983.
   The juice, labeled 100 percent apple juice for babies, was
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no
apple juice, prosecutors charged. There has been no evidence that
the phony juice caused any health problems.
   Beech-Nut, the corporation, pleaded guilty in November to 215
counts of violating federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a
$2 million fine.
   Lavery, who oversaw the upstate manufacturing where the juice
was made, was convicted conspiracy, 18 counts of mail fraud and 429
counts of violating federal food and drug laws.
   Beech-Nut, based in Fort Washington, Pa., is a subsidiary of
Nestle S.A. of Switzerland.

<HEAD>Kodak Introduces New Batteries, Cameras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Eastman Kodak Co. on Tuesday introduced a
line of batteries that are designed to last longer in cameras and
other photographic equipment, a company spokesman said.
   Kodak also introduced two new cameras, including an $11.95 model
for young children called the ``Mickey-Matic,'' and two new color
slide films.
   The line of ``Photolife'' alkaline batteries was made to perform
best in devices such as point-and-shoot 35 mm cameras and flash
attachments that frequently demand short, repeated bursts of energy.
   ``We have created these premium, high-performance energy cells
to meet the special demands of picture-taking consumers,'' said
Martin Adams, vice president for marketing of Ultra Technologies,
the Kodak subsidiary that oversees the battery business.
   The batteries come in either AA-size or AAA-size and will be
available in September.
   Kodak has been struggling to gain a share of the market that is
dominated by Duracell and Eveready.
   Kodak is not the first to launch a special battery for a
specific purpose. Several months ago, Eveready introduced a line of
batteries called ``The Conductor'' which are designed for use in
audio equipment, such as portable stereos.
   Duracell Inc., the leader in the sale of AA and AAA batteries,
hasn't gotten into the specific-use market because its batteries
perform ``as well or better'' than any other akaline battery in all
categories, said James Donahue, a company spokesman.
   The other new Kodak products announced Tuesday are: another
easy-to-use 35 mm camera, at $89.95, to go with Kodak's eight other
35 mm models released in the past two years; the ``Mickey-Matic,''
a 110-format camera; new Kodachrome film that is the first slide
film available at 200 ISO; Ektachrome 100 HC film, which will
provide more saturated colors in a versatile, general-purpose slide
film.

   Members of Northwest Airlines' Worldperks
program will receive frequent-flier mileage credit if they use MCI
Communications Corp.'s long-distance telephone service, Northwest
announced Tuesday.
   Starting Sept. 1, Worldperks members will be awarded one bonus
mile for each dollar they spend on MCI service, Northwest said. As
an incentive to apply for the free MCI-Northwest card, the airline
will give each applicant a free upgrade to first class on a
Northwest domestic flight.
   A.B. Magary, Northwest's executive vice president of marketing,
said MCI joins Northwest's hotel and rental car partners and the
Worldperks Visa card as non-flying ways of earning Worldperks miles.
   ``The demographics of frequent-flier program members tracks very
closely with large long-distance phone users,'' said Brian
Thompson, executive vice president of MCI.
   ``This program represents a unique marketing opportunity for
both MCI and Northwest to broaden and enhance the value brought to
their respective customers.''

<HEAD>Mazda Combining Two U.S. Sales Companies Into One, Laying Off 75
Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. will combine its two
U.S. sales and importing companies into one July 1, eliminating 70
jobs at one of the companies' headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Mazda is combining Mazda Motors of America Central and Mazda
Motors of America East into Mazda Motor of America Inc. About 20 of
the 330 workers at the Mazda East headquarters will be laid off by
the end of June, Yoshinori Taura, president of the new Irvine,
Calif.-based company, said Tuesday.
   In the next three to six months, 45 to 50 other Jacksonville
workers will be laid off. But those workers were given bonuses to
stay through the transition and all 70 will be assisted in finding
jobs, Taura said.
   ``I feel very sorry for those workers. It is not our desire to
have to ask them to leave. We will help them,'' Taura said, adding
that the consolidation would improve Mazda's efficiency in the U.S.
market.
   ``We believe the improved efficiency and services that will
result from this reorganization of our U.S. marketing activity will
be reflected in an enriched product line, one which more closely
reflects the needs and desires of our customers here,'' Taura said.
   The use of two sales companies by a foreign company in the
United States was unique to Mazda. Mazda Central, which included 31
states, and Mazda East, which included 18, were formed 11 years
ago, when Mazda was suffering financially. A company that imported
into Hawaii also will be folded into the new company.
   Each company was half-owned by Mazda. The other partner in Mazda
Central was C. Itoh and Co. Ltd., a big Japanese trading company,
which will own 20 percent of Mazda Motor of America. The Mazda East
partner was Sumitomo Corp., Mazda's banker, which will own 30
percent of the new company.
   Taura was president of Mazda Central, which will keep all its
workers. About 15 Americans and 10 Japanese Mazda East workers will
be transferred from Jacksonville to Irvine, he said.
   Taura will report to Keiji Asano, a senior managing director of
the parent company, who was named chairman of Mazda Motor of
America and who is based in Japan.
   Mazda has three other companies in the United States. The newly
formed Mazda Research and Development of North America Inc. will
handle product testing and evaluation and development of new
materials and other research.
   Hiroshi Moriyoshi was named president of that company, which is
based in Irvine, where it has a new $23 million design center. MRA
also has operations in Ann Arbor and Flat Rock, Mich., and in
Washington, D.C. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mazda (North
America) Inc.
   Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corp. builds cars at Mazda's new
assembly plant in Flat Rock. The plant began production in
September, building the Ford Probe and the Mazda MX-6, both sporty
coupes.
   The Flat Rock plant also will begin building the Mazda 626 sedan
in 1989.
   Mazda (North America) Inc., also based in Irvine, will ship cars
from the Flat Rock plant, supply parts and accessories to the plant
and to Mazda Motor of America and provide other parent-company
support.

   Morton Thiokol Inc. test-fired its
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket Tuesday with no apparent
problems in the second-to-last test before shuttle flights are to
resume.
   ``All indications are we had an excellent test,'' said Royce
Mitchell, solid rocket program manager for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. ``Everything went smoothly. The motor
performed very, very well.''
   Brilliant yellow flame erupted from the 126-foot-long rocket and
grayish-brown smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air amid a
roar that could be heard for miles.
   The 122-second horizontal test, conducted at 1 p.m. MDT at
Morton Thiokol's Wasatch Operations plant west of here, was the
fourth of five tests required to qualify major design features of
the solid fuel booster before the shuttle program, grounded after
the 1986 Challenger disaster, can resume.
   ``We've got a lot of work to do,'' said J.R. Thompson, director
of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. ``Barring
some surprise, I feel very good about'' an August launch.
   Allen McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice president of engineering,
said preliminary data indicated that the motor successfully
withstood the simulated liftoff and flight stresses.
   ``From all aspects, we can say it was a totally successful
test,'' McDonald said. ``I hope it looks as good from the inside as
it does on the outside.''
   ``It's an extremely good test,'' Mitchell said.
   He said engineers will spend the next two days studying computer
readouts of the test and disassembling the motor, and officials
expect to have a complete analysis within two weeks.
   Fifteen minutes after the test, a nozzle exit cone toppled from
the rear of the motor to simulate its separation from the motor
during a flight.
   NASA has scheduled an Aug. 31 launch of the shuttle Discovery.
   The booster tested Tuesday was free of planned flaws introduced
in previous tests to determine whether the joint can withstand the
intense heat and pressures of launch even in the event of some
failures, Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said.
   It also was the first use of a new $22 million test stand, which
has 1,216 channels of instrumentation and uses hydraulic struts to
duplicate steering, flight turbulence and other stresses the motor
will endure during launch, he said.
   The building also can heat an entire motor to 110 degrees
Fahrenheit or cool it to 20 degrees. The rocket's 1.1 million
pounds of propellant has been heated to a uniform 90 degrees, or
about 20 degrees warmer than the usual launch temperature, to allow
engineers to test its performance at the upper limit for an actual
launch, Raab said.
   David Ewing, deputy director of program management for Morton
Thiokol, said the hydraulic struts that duplicate launch stresses
are based on ``the worst-case sideloads'' experienced in past
shuttle flights.
   During launch the boosters flex about 26 inches at the tip,
creating a ``twang,'' he said. The test simulated those pressures
on the rocket motor's joints.
   The Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, was blamed on a
faulty booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to snake
through an O-ring, triggering the blast that killed the seven crew
members.
   The new joint incorporates three Viton O-rings instead of two, a
metal lip to help hold the joint together and an adhesively bonded
relief slot that reduces stresses and increases the sealing action
of the bonded surface under pressure, Raab said.
   Moreover, the rocket's three field joints are equipped with
heaters to maintain a minimum temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
Sub-freezing temperatures the night before the doomed Challenger
launch were found to have contributed to the failure of the joint.
   For the experiment simulating the nozzle exit cone's separation
during flight, the test device was fitted with an explosive
severance system activated 15 minutes after the test.
   Dozens of visitors from Chicago-based Morton Thiokol, NASA and
various subcontractors were at the remote desert plant to watch
Tuesday's test.
   The final full-scale test is scheduled for some time in July. At
that time, severe flaws will be introduced in the joints ``to test
the system to its limits,'' Raab said.
   Testing of the redesigned motor has gone so well, he said, that
Discovery's two boosters were hooked up Friday with an external
fuel tank at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the stack was to be joined
with the shuttle Thursday.

<HEAD>Suit Accuses Suzuki Of RICO Violations with Samurai Trucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit filed Tuesday accused Suzuki
Motors Co. of violating federal racketeering laws by fraudulently
promoting its sporty Samurai vehicles as safe.
   The class-action suit alleged Suzuki and the firms handling the
company's public relations and advertising routinely committed mail
and wire fraud and conspiracy to conceal the Samurai's dangers,
violating the federal Racketeering Influenced, Corrupt
Organizations Act.
   The suit filed by Dr. Harold Kay, of Wynnewood, Pa., on behalf
of all Samurai owners not employed by Suzuki seeks unspecified
punitive and compensatory damages from the defendants.
   Suzuki has been defending itself vehemently against a call by
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, for a ban
of the vehicles on the grounds that they tend to roll over in
sudden turns.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, contended the defendants
were ``aware the vehicles were not safe but instead were by design
and construction dangerous and unsuitable for on- or off-road use
and that advertising and other sales representations were false and
misleading.''
   Laura Segall, a spokeswoman for Suzuki and an employee of the
defendant public relations firm Rogers and Associates, would not
comment on the suit because she had not seen it.
   ``The bottom line we've said for the last 10 days is that it's
safe and stable,'' Ms. Segall said Tuesday.
   Consumers Union said June 2 that the $8,500 Samurai was the
first car out of 349 it had tested in the last decade to roll over
during a routine accident-avoidance test, in which cars swerve to
avoid a road obstacle.
   Suzuki said 300-pound outriggers attached to the trucks to
prevent them from rolling over completely during the tests had
contributed to the results. The company also partially blamed the
driver's actions for causing the vehicle to tip up on two wheels
during the test.
   Suzuki says the Samurai was tested thoroughly for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the United
States in November 1985. Suzuki sold 154,675 Samurais through April.
   The lawsuit cites National Traffic Highway Safety Administration
figures indicating at least 44 Samurai rollover accidents resulted
in at least 53 injuries and 16 deaths.
   In addition to the Consumers Union claims, the suit cites the
Center for Auto Safety's February petition to the federal
government to order a Samurai recall.
   Suzuki Motors Co. Ltd. of Japan; U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp, of
Brea, Calif; Rogers and Associates, of Los Angeles; and
Keye-Donna-Pearlstein, a Los Angeles advertising firm, are named as
defendants.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Outlined Proposal For Tax Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party approved a
blueprint for sweeping reform of the national tax system on
Tuesday, and pegged a controversial consumer sales tax at 3
percent, party officials said.
   The LDP's Tax System Research Council completed the final plan
that could pave the way for the first major overhaul of Japan's
postwar tax system.
   The LDP draft includes some $44.8 billion in tax cuts. Corporate
and personal income tax rates as well as inheritance levies will be
cut in the new tax plan, which LDP officials say they hope to
implement by April 1989.
   ``It took six months for us only to agree on the sales tax
rate,'' said Sadanori Yamanaka, the legislator who heads the
council. ``Now, the party must be firmly united under the new plan
to overcome the opposition parties' attempt to block the bill.''
   The new tax plan caps long and fiercely-debated sessions
regarding the amount of tax reductions and the level of sales taxes
among ruling party members and finance ministry officials.
   But it also is expected to come under hot debate from opposition
parties in the upcoming session of the Diet, the Japanese
parliament.
   The new plan finalized Tuesday marks the third attempt by the
government and ruling party to introduce an indirect tax, following
others in 1979 and 1987.
   Last year, then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone suffered a
serious political setback when his party was defeated in local
elections over the sales tax issue.
   Shintaro Abe, LDP secretary general, said after unveiling the
new tax plan that the party still faced the task of garnering wide
support for the reform package.
   ``We have just completed the first stage,'' he said. ``The next
steps are going to be the real challenge, but I think there is a
consensus within the party.''
   Opposition party leaders denounced the ruling party's decision
to push forward with the once-defeated tax reform plan.
   ``It is a serious challenge to the people of our country,'' said
Shizuo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the Japan Socialist Party,
the largest opposition party. ``The LDP must dissolve the Diet and
let the people decide on the issue.''
   Satsuki Eda, chairman of the Social Democratic Alliance, said,
``I am determined to cooperate with other opposition parties to
block the passage of the new tax law in the Diet by all means.''
   The Finance Ministry _ which had sought a 5 percent sales tax _
also welcomed the new tax system as a boost to the domestic economy.
   ``The new tax system is expected to lift the gross national
product by 0.1 percent,'' said a Finance Ministry official. As a
result, ``the Japanese economy will be vitalized and expanded
domestic demand will draw more imports.''
   Finance Ministry officials have argued that revenue from a 3
percent sales tax would total only about $40 billion to $43
billion, short of the amount slated in tax cuts.
   The ministry has said it hopes to eliminate budget
deficit-covering bond issues by fiscal 1990, but may have to revise
its target if the new LDP plan is passed.
   An LDP official said the tax plan will be presented to the Diet
in July for passage by next fall.
