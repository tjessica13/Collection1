   The California Aqueduct, which supplies half
of Southern California's water, was re-opened Tuesday following
repairs to fix damage from an earthquake last week, officials said.
   Three of 14 pumps at the A.D. Edmonston Pumping Plant in the
Tehachapi Mountains began pumping water to the 440-mile waterway at
3 p.m. and another two came on line at 4 p.m., said Dave Taylor,
dispatcher for the state water project.
   Repairs were still being made to other circuit breakers at the
plant, he said, but it was unknown when they would be complete.
   All water deliveries north of the plant were undisturbed during
the shutdown. But deliveries to the south had been coming from
water already in storage.
   The quake, measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale, hit the Garlock
fault near Gorman, 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. It was
followed by two aftershocks, measuring 4.0 and 3.4 respectively.
   The pumping station is located in the Tehachapi Mountans, 75
miles northwest of Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   A women's club that asked celebrities
for their favorite recipes to include in a cookbook was overwhelmed
with contributions from likes of first lady Nancy Reagan, actor Tom
Selleck and others.
   ``I was just surprised we got so many back,'' said South Hadley
Women's Club member Ruth Ryder, who received recipes from 24 of the
35 politicians, actors, sports figures and other celebrities she
wrote ``just on my own.''
   Jimmy Carter, for example, the peanut farmer who became
president, forwarded instructions for fish fillets fried in,
naturally, peanut oil. His wife, Rosalynn, sent a recipe for a
cheese ring she said is a specialty of the Carter hometown of
Plains, Ga.
   Other first lady contributions include Mrs. Reagan's cold
cucumber soup, Betty Ford's blueberry and banana bread and Lady
Bird Johnson's brandied fruit.
   ``Cooking with Friends,'' containing 336 recipes, is on sale for
$5 in the public library in this town of 16,000 people, and is
selling like hotcakes.
   Mrs. Ryder, one of 88 club members, said Tuesday that more than
400 of the 536 copies published have been sold a few weeks after
the first printing.
   Among other contributors are Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the
Democratic presidential hopeful. He sent recipes for chicken
casserole, an eggplant dish called ``tourlou'' and apple apricot
pie.
   His Republican rival, Vice President George Bush, sent a recipe
for Caesar salad.
   Selleck, star of the television series ``Magnum, P.I.,'' rushed
a recipe for chicken with wine from his home in Hawaii, but it
arrived too late for publication, so the club copied and slipped it
between the pages.
   Proceeds go to scholarships for high school students, dogs for
the hearing impaired and handicapped, and a week at a summer camp
for a Boy Scout.

   Joy Dirksen Baker, wife of White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker, has had numerous hospital stays for
ailments ranging from back pain to lung cancer in recent years.
   Baker mentioned the health of his wife and his stepmother, Irene
Baker, in his announcement Tuesday that he will resign as White
House chief of staff.
   Joy Baker was listed in satisfactory condition with a chronic
back ailment Tuesday and, in a separate Knoxville hospital, Irene
Baker was in fair condition with stomach pains.
   Baker, a Tennessee Republican and former Senate majority leader,
will be replaced by his deputy, Kenneth Duberstein, on July 1,
White House officials said.
   Joy Baker, 59, was admitted to St. Mary's Medical Center on
Thursday for treatment of a back ailment, a condition that has
required hospitalization several times in recent years, said
hospital spokeswoman Janice Webster.
   In spring 1986, Mrs. Baker entered a North Carolina hospital for
evaluation and treatment of back pain. She has been admitted twice
in recent years to a Nashville hospital for back pain and has
traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for evaluation and
treatment of the back pain.
   Two months ago, she was admitted for treatment of acute
bronchitis at another Knoxville hospital. About a year earlier she
spent a few days in a Washington hospital for follow-up tests after
surgery in spring 1986 on a non-malignant intestinal obstruction.
   Mrs. Baker had a malignant tumor removed from her right lung in
1982 and also has been hospitalized for stomach ulcers.
   Baker, 62, had considered running for the Republican
presidential nomination but decided to accept the February 1987
appointment as White House chief of staff, succeeding Donald Regan.
He had said his wife's health would be a factor in deciding whether
to run for president.
   Joy Baker is the daughter of the late Sen. Everett Dirksen, an
Illinois Republican who held office from 1951 until his death Sept.
7, 1969, and had been the Senate GOP leader since 1959.
   Irene Baker, 86, was admitted to Baptist Hospital in Knoxville
this week and was undergoing tests for stomach pains.
   After Baker's father, Howard H. Baker Sr., died in January 1964,
Irene Baker won a special election to serve the rest of his term as
U.S. representative in 1964-65. The elder Baker was first elected
in 1951.

<HEAD>Turkey Rules Out Troop Withdrawal From Cyprus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal on
Tuesday ruled out any withdrawal of Turkish troops from the divided
Mediterranean island of Cyprus unless there is a complete
settlement of Greek-Turkish disputes.
   ``I would like to see a solution to the Cyprus problem, but it
should be a complete one,'' Ozal told reporters on the second day
of his three-day visit to Greece. ``There should be a bicommunal,
bizonal, federated state (in Cyprus) and I think it has to take
some time.''
   His remarks dashed Greek hopes he would make a gesture to
improve relations by reducing the Turkish military presence in
Cyprus.
   Greek officials say there are about 30,000 Turkish soldiers in
northern Cyprus, where the Turkish-Cypriot community declared a
breakaway republic in 1983. The Turkish government says it has
19,000 troopers in Cyprus.
   Cyprus was divided into separate Greek-Cypriot and
Turkish-Cypriot sectors when Turkey invaded the island in 1974
following a brief coup by Greek-Cypriot national guard leaders who
planned to unite the island with Greece.
   The Cyprus problem, sidelined at two earlier Greek-Turkish
summit meetings this year in Switzerland and Belgium, has emerged
as the key issue in Ozal's talks with Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou at a seaside hotel here outside Athens.
   Papandreou has proposed a demilitarization of the island and the
establishment of a joint Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot police
force under U.N. auspices.
   He also links a settlement on Cyprus with dropping Greek's
objection to Turkey's application to join the European Economic
Community.
   The Turkish premier said he believes the complex web of
Greek-Turkish disputes could be solved with ``courage and
creativity.''
   The two NATO allies came close to war last year over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean sea. They also have quarrels over
Aegean airspace, the military status of some Greek islands and
Greek-owned property in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

<HEAD>Telephone Co. Apologizes To Elderly Left Without Service For Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A telephone company that left elderly
residents of a housing project without service for a month
apologized by serving them a catered lunch and giving them tote
bags and a rebate on their bills.
   ``There is no good excuse for what happened. We simply didn't
get the job done in time,'' Jack Briggs, assistant to New England
Telephone Co.'s vice president for Massachusetts, told residents of
Rose Manor at Monday's lunch.
   Briggs, whose apology drew a round of applause from the
residents, said the copmpany hadn't provided enough time to add
phone lines to accommodate 54 new housing units before the units
opened last month.
   While the telephone company ate crow, about 35 elderly residents
dined on creamed chicken or beef bourguignon. Briggs also handed
out promotional canvas tote bags and told the residents their
accounts would be credited for the cost of their telephone
installation fee, which ranged from $35 to $50.
   Briggs said the company had at first considered sending flowers,
but decided on the lunch and personal apology. ``People have really
been very nice,'' he said.
   Telephone service was installed on June 2, he said.
   ``It's a great relief to all of us,'' said resident Carmen Ochs.
``And the lunch is very good.''
   Another resident, Elizabeth Wood, said she was stricken with
pneumonia before the phones were installed, and had to flag down a
passing maintenance man to summon an ambulance to take her to the
hospital.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven score and four years ago, a lanky
circuit-riding lawyer with political ambitions paid $1,500 for a
comfortable frame house on a muddy sidestreet a few blocks from the
new state Capitol.
   He lived there with his wife and children for all but two of the
next 17 years. The family moved out of town in 1861 and never
returned.
   Because the frontier lawyer's name was Abraham Lincoln, his
Springfield home became a tourist site drawing 500,000 people
annually in recent years. That prompted a $2.2 million renovation
completed last month.
   Restorers believe that if the former president and his family
were to walk in the front door when their home is reopened to the
public Thursday, they'd be pleased with the result.
   ``At the moment, it probably looks an awful lot better than it
ever did when they lived there,'' said Francis O. Krupka,
historical architect for the National Park Service, which maintains
the home.
   The restoration is the fruit of three years of sleuthing by
historians and architects pursuing details such as wallpaper
patterns, the precise shade of brown on the home's exterior and
whether the indoor woodwork was stained, varnished or painted.
   Their search might seem to border on the obsessive, but
restorers say they're assembling small pieces of the historical
mosaic of Lincoln's life.
   ``It demonstrates something of the environment that he lived and
worked in, a remnant of the environment that produced the man and
possibly influenced what he did,'' Krupka said.
   Lincoln bought the house in May 1844 from Charles Dresser, an
Episcopal clergyman who presided at Lincoln's wedding. After
boarding at a tavern for $4 a week and renting a cottage for his
growing family, it was the only home Lincoln ever owned.
   ``The framework and floors were oak, the laths hand-split
hickory, the doors, door frames and weatherboarding black walnut,''
poet Carl Sandburg wrote in ``The Prairie Years,'' the first part
of his epic Lincoln biography.
   ``The house was painted, one visitor wrote, `a Quaker tint of
light brown' ... Three blocks east the cornfields began and farms
mile after mile.''
   Similar accounts by contemporary visitors, along with
photographs and prints from Lincoln's time, served as important
guides for restorers.
   But the primary source of information, Krupka said, was the
house itself.
   ``You can't after 150 years recreate an environment exactly when
you have insufficient documentation,'' he said. ``All you can do is
make the best of what you have. ... You get in there and start
looking at it and see the various details of the structure.''
   The restorers found that termites had bored a 6-inch tunnel
through an 8-inch floor beam. Nails connecting structural timbers
had loosened. The house's brick foundation had to be shored up.
Floors designed for a family were reinforced to bear the weight of
tourist throngs.
   But they also found solid evidence of the skill of the
19th-century tradesmen who built the house.
   ``It had some problems, but it was a very well-constructed
house,'' Krupka said. ``It had to be _ otherwise it wouldn't have
survived this long.''
   To ensure its survival, the house has been equipped with smoke
detectors, automatic fire extinguishers, vapor barriers and systems
to control heat and humidity _ all neatly concealed in the original
framework.
   Set amid four blocks of restored 19th Century houses, the
Lincoln home now appears, as best restorers can determine, as it
did in 1860, when Lincoln was elected president.
   A few months later, on a rainy Monday in February 1861, Lincoln
left Springfield to take office.
   ``Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from
a young to an old man,'' Lincoln told a crowd that had gathered at
the train station. ``Here my children have been born, and one is
buried.
   ``I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return
...''
   The president was assassinated in 1865.

<HEAD>Viral Epidemic Will Halve Holland's 1,000 Seals, Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A viral epidemic that has killed
up to 800 seals in the North Sea eventually will cut in half the
number of seals roaming Dutch coastal waters, a Dutch wildlife
expert says.
   The epidemic, which has decimated seals in the West German and
Danish sectors of the heavily polluted North Sea this spring, will
leave only 500 seals in Dutch waters, according to Dr. Peter
Reynders of the Dutch National Nature Conservation Institute.
   It may be the year 2000 before the seal population can be
restored, he was quoted as saying in a interview published Tuesday
in the Amsterdam newspaper Trouw.
   Medical experts are investigating the possibility that the
disease is linked to a herpes-type virus, according to the Seal
Nursery in Pieterburen in the northern Netherlands, Western
Europe's only seal hospital.
   The infection attacks the animals' immune system, and they
eventually die of pneumonia.
   The hospital has linked at least 15 recent seal deaths and nine
premature births in Dutch waters to the viral infection.
   ``Every preparation has been made for the intensive nursing and
treatment of sick and prematurely born seals,'' said a hospital
statement.
   Dutch researchers also are trying to find out whether the deaths
are linked to North Sea pollution or to the massive clusters of
algae that have killed thousands of fish off Norway and Denmark
this spring.
   In West Germany, the seal epidemic has sparked a major debate on
oil slicks and chemical discharges in the North Sea, and
environmentalists are demanding drastic measures to halt the
pollution.

<TEXT>
   Italy is demonstrating its willingness to
``share the risk'' of defending the West by agreeing in principle
to welcome a unit of U.S. warplanes, President Reagan told Italian
Prime Minister Ciraco De Mita on Tuesday.
   De Mita met Reagan at the White House to prepare for next week's
annual economic summit of leading industrialized democracies in
Toronto and talk about the president's summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   Reagan praised Italy for moving toward acceptance of 72 F-16
fighter jets that comprise the Air Force's 401st Tactical Fighter
Wing. The wing is being ejected from Torrejon Air Base in Spain.
   The United States wanted Spain to keep the planes _ which are
earmarked for the defense of southern Europe _ but after lengthy
negotiations, Spain declined last year to renew the base agreement.
   Reagan said Italy's willingness to consider accepting the
planes, at NATO's suggestion, was ``exemplary'' and was ``typical
of Italy's serious approach toward its alliance commitments, its
willingness to do its part, to share the risk and responsibilities
as well as the benefits of NATO membership.''
   De Mita told editors and reporters of The Washington Post on
Tuesday that the decision already had been made to take the planes
and he described the required votes by the Italian Parliament as
formalities.
   The prime minister told the newspaper for a story in Wednesday's
editions that Italian military authorities decided Tuesday to
station the fighter-bombers at a military airport at Crotone in
southern Italy. He said his five-party coalition government agreed
June 4 to take the planes and has only to ``report'' to Parliament
on its decision.
   Reagan thanked Italy for supporting the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces Treaty adopted by the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   ``Without Italy's courage, determination and support throughout
INF deployment and negotiations, there would have been no treaty,''
Reagan told De Mita. ``We will continue to depend, and gratefully
so, on Italy's support as an ally, and advice as a friend.''
   Italy's lower house of parliament is scheduled to vote on the
F-16 basing Thursday or Friday, and then the Italian Senate must
give its approval.
   Following parliamentary approval, NATO experts will meet to
determine where to deploy the planes, said a U.S. official who
briefed reporters Monday on grounds he not be identified publicly.
   Asked if De Mita expressed optimism about approval, the official
said, ``the prime minister did not offer a judgment of the outcome,
but the whole matter was discussed in very positive terms as a
matter that is in place and moving forward.''
   The official indicated that a new facility may have to be built
to accommodate the 401st, but he said no decision had been made.
   De Mita's visit to Washington was his first since taking office
in April as the head of Italy's 48th government since World War II.
His predecessor, Giovanni Goria, served only seven months.
   In a farewell statement at the White House, De Mita said he
``reaffirmed the fact that Italy will continue with conviction to
share in the commitments and undertakings of the alliance which
binds us, safeguards our freedoms and underpins the development of
the West.''
   ``The prospects for a lasting peace require us to prevent any
weakening of our Atlantic solidarity, to refrain from any actions
of unilateral disarmament,'' he said.
   De Mita said later at a news conference that a disagreement over
Middle East policy was aired during his talks with administration
officials.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is trying to arrange
negotiations between Israel and a delegation of Jordanians and
Palestinians. He has ruled out participation by the Palestine
Liberation Organization unless it accepts Israel's right to exist,
as well as creation of a Palestinian state.
   De Mita said he told the Americans that Italy continues to
believe the PLO is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people.
   One of the topics expected to arise at the Toronto summit is the
extent to which the industrialized democracies should help Eastern
European nations solve their economic problems.
   De Mita said he and the president agreed that massive aid for
these countries should be withheld as long as their economies are
predominantly state-managed.
   De Mita planned to meet on Wednesday with members of Congress
and Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci before making a private
visit to Bar Harbor, Maine.

   More than 200,000 people attended a concert

   The dispatch from the official Cuban agency, received in Mexico

   Elsewhere in Cuba, ``in the name of Che, workers massively
donated labor, artists gave concerts, newspapers, radio and
television filled their spaces, children recited poems and doves
flew at midnight,'' Prensa Latina said.
   Guevara, born in Argentina in 1928, became a hero of the
revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959. He later was
killed in Bolivia.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The host city for the seven-nation economic
summit that begins Sunday once suffered the nickname ``Toronto the
Good.'' Canadians found its Anglo-Saxon rectitude insufferable, and
it was impossible to get a drink on Sunday.
   But over the past 20 years, waves of immigrants and a buoyant
economy have transformed Toronto into the nation's biggest and
richest city, a financial center with cosmopolitan flair rivaling
Montreal.
   From trendy bicycle paths to the crescent-shaped towers of City
Hall, Toronto works hard to promote the image of a city that works.
   The metropolitan population of 3.4 million is growing by 100,000
a year, but it's still possible to live in a cosy family cottage
within view of 70-story skyscrapers.
   There's a clean, cheap subway and picturesque red trolley cars.
Bankers join lines at street-corner stalls, even in winter, for the
city's trademark giant hot dogs, a bargain at under $2.
   Yonge Street is the main drag, reputedly the longest street in
the world as it runs into northern Ontario. Tawdry in parts, it
takes visitors to the glittering Eaton Center mall, the city's main
tourist attraction.
   In winter, shopping tunnels stretching for nearly three miles
under the city form the world's largest subterranean complex.
   Downtown is overshadowed by the 1,815-foot CN Tower, the tallest
known free-standing structure. Below it, a $314 million domed
stadium is being constructed for baseball's Toronto Blue Jays.
   The provincial legislature and University of Toronto campus
decorate the heart of the city, while the sandbar-like Toronto
Islands in Lake Ontario are home to a lavish yacht club and
relaxing park.
   Other attractions include a thoroughbred race track three miles
from City Hall, world-class museums, the Toronto Symphony, a zoo
with 4,000 animals and the remains of Fort York, scene of a key
battle in the War of 1812.
   From designer hamburgers to Basque cuisine, good restaurants
abound as do live theaters. Flak-jacketed police in the St.
Lawrence market area this week were not part of a summit SWAT team
_ they were diverting traffic around a film set, one of dozens of
movies and TV shows shot in a city dubbed Hollywood North.
   ``We want the leaders to see Toronto as it really is,'' Mayor
Art Eggleton said in an interview. ``I'd love for the Italian prime
minister to see St. Clair Avenue,'' he said of Little Italy,
meeting place for the city's 300,000-strong Italian community.
   There's a Portuguese market, Greek town, Jewish garment district
and 50 other ethnic communities, a diversity celebrated at this
month's Caravan of multicultural pavilions around the city.
   But despite its growth and virtual full employment, Toronto does
have problems. Burglary and drug abuse is increasing, the city is
the AIDS capital of Canada, and rush-hour traffic leads to some
distinctly ungracious driving.
   The Metro Tenant Federation estimates there are 20,000 homeless
people in a city starved of affordable housing, while 60,000
require emergency food relief each month.
   Residents often seem torn between old-fashioned values and
prosperity.
   The two hottest local issues are Mayor Eggleton's proposal to
make Yonge Street one-way downtown to improve traffic flow, and a
debate over whether stores should open on Sunday.
   Novelist Margaret Atwood said the mayor's idea showed signs of
``demonic possession.'' She pleaded for ``a people city, not a car
city.''
   Bought from the Missisauga Indians for 1,700 pounds sterling and
founded in 1793, Toronto has not entirely shaken its puritanical
past. One west end neighborhood is still dry _ no bars or liquor
stores.
   In preparation for the three-day summit, City Hall ordered
graffiti scrubbed off 200 buildings, street people cleaned out of
the parks and prostitutes busted in police sweeps.
   ``The same rationale that's used to remove graffiti is being
used to remove people from the streets,'' said Michael Shapcott of
the Christian Resource Center which helps the homeless. ``It's more
of a propaganda issue than a security issue.''
   As the first North American city to host the summit, Toronto
wants to leave a good impression to bolster its bid for the 1996
Olympic Games.
   A parking lot has been converted into a $1.6 million tent city
called Summit Square, where 3,000 summit reporters will be offered
food, drink and entertainment around the clock. Between the tents,
a beaver from northern Ontario will frolic in a babbling brook.
   Summiteers are expected to spend $14 million at hotels,
restaurants and stores.

<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. shrugs it off as a
fact of life and tends to business. The unions are waging a
boycott. And, as the strike by 1,200 paperworkers turns 1 year old
Thursday, both sides say their resolve holds strong.
   ``Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,'' Dick Tardif said
recently as he walked a picket line at IP's sprawling Androscoggin
mill.
   The unions are focusing on the United Paperworkers International
Union's national ``corporate campaign.'' Organized by labor
strategist Ray Rogers, it is designed to put financial and
political pressure on banks and businesses that own IP stock or
have directors who also serve as IP directors.
   The company continues to run the mill, one of its largest,
around the clock with about 1,000 replacement workers recruited
elsewhere. It boasts that production is nearly at pre-strike
levels, and it insists the non-union employees are there to stay.
   ``They've given up other jobs to come work for the company. They
endure harassment, intimidation, threats, certainly daily verbal
abuse, in some cases acts of violence,'' said IP spokesman Richard
White.
   White said the company accepted ``a moral obligation to these
people'' when it hired them and gave the unions repeated warnings
that replacements would be permanent.
   ``The strike has gone on too long,'' he said. ``It's time to get
it behind us.''
   It's been a long, tense year for this once-sleepy western Maine
town, including boisterous rallies and marches and a court order to
curb name-calling, vandalism and occasional violence on the picket
lines. A judge cited the unions for contempt, ordering a $10,000
fine, and the company is seeking a second citation.
   No talks are scheduled. And the Jay strikers, the largest group
among 3,500 union members embroiled in labor disputes that also
affect IP mills in Alabama, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, will
automatically lose any say in the unions' future at the mill as of
Thursday's anniversary of their walkout.
   The replacements are seeking an election to decertify the UPIU
and the International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers as
bargaining agents for mill employees. After Thursday, by law, only
the replacement workers may vote.
   Union leaders acknowledge it is only a matter of time before the
National Labor Relations Board orders an election, and that
decertification is inevitable. Instead, they look to their ongoing
campaigns to boycott companies with ties to IP and to build
solidarity with union members at other IP mills.
   ``Right now, all we have (with IP) is a paper relationship
anyway,'' said Jonathan Reitman, a lawyer for UPIU Local 14, which
represents the vast majority of strikers. Any election would be
``almost irrelevant,'' he said.
   ``It's an all-out war'' between the company and the UPIU, said
Felix A. Jacques, executive vice president of Local 14.
   Among the union's boycott targets are the PNC Financial Corp., a
Pittsburgh-based holding company with banks in three states;
Coca-Cola Co.; and the Bank of Boston and its subsidiaries in
Maine, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The union also may eventually
call for boycotts of IP products by institutions and government
agencies, said Jacques.
   IP's White cites Rogers' involvement in the 1985 Hormel
meatpackers' strike in Minnesota, which was marred by violence and
ended a year later with replacement workers still there, as
evidence that the campaign against IP will not succeed.
   White said production at the Jay mill is up to nearly 94 percent
of its average capacity of 1,500 tons a day, compared to 97 percent
before the June 16 walkout.
   The company has sought to divert attention from the replacement
workers and toward the dispute that led to the walkout _ IP's
demand for looser work rules and elimination of premium pay for
Sundays and holidays.
   But the unions have rejected any proposal that does not
guarantee the strikers their old jobs.
   The mood could turn uglier this summer, when the strikers' state
unemployment benefits, already extended to the one-year maximum,
expire. Strikers, who averaged more than $35,000 a year at the
mill, can collect weekly unemployment checks of $161 plus $5 per
dependent, and less than $100 a week from the union.
   Inside the mill, replacement workers are settling in and
building their own camaraderie. ``IP Baseball _ 1 Strike & You're
Out,'' reads one employee's T-shirt.

<TEXT>
   For 500 years, Brazil's northeast has
been potentially rich and chronically poor.
   Today, as Brazil struggles to become a modern developed nation,
the Northeast holds it back _ not wholly of its own accord.
   The nine northeastern states cover 1 million square miles of
land where Brazil bulges out into the Atlantic. In the area, 2{
times the size of Texas, live 45 million of the nation's 143
million people.
   But while the prosperous South, with its airplane and computer
factories, has made Brazil the world's eighth-largest economy, the
northeast remains poor, neglected, diseased and assailed by
devastating cyclical droughts.
   Statistics paint a gloomy picture of the northeast:
   _ Infant mortality is higher than in sub-Saharan Africa at 124
deaths per 1,000 births, compared to 67 per 1,000 in the South.
   _ Life expectancy is 51 years, compared with 67 in the South.
   _ A full 50 percent of northeasterners cannot write their own
names; 26 percent can't elsewhere in Brazil.
   _ Diseases long-eradicated elsewhere _ leprosy, chagas disease,
polio, tuberculosis, even the plague _ still kill and deform in the
northeast.
   ``We're creating a race of undersized subhumans who think only
of survival,'' said Carlos Hollanda Labor, health secretary for the
northeast's Ceara state.
   In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy recognized the
parched region, considered one of the world's poorest, as a
possible source of social unrest. Shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution in Cuba, Kennedy launched the U.S. Alliance for
Progress, which promised billions of dollars and poured millions
into development of Brazil's northeast _ until a 1964 Brazilian
right-wing military coup eased fears of a communist or left-wing
uprising.
   Droughts were a tragic part of the northeastern landscape even
before Portuguese conquerers recorded the first one more than 400
years ago.
   A drought that lasted from 1979 to 1984 killed an estimated
250,000 peasant farmers and chased millions more to big city slums
in search of food, water and jobs.
   This year, an expected rainfall of 31 inches will provide a
respite for the characteristically small-statured northeasterners,
but it is not likely to alter their struggle to survive.
   ``The essential problem here is not whether it rains or not,''
said Ari Guimaraes, head of the political science department of the
University of Bahia, another northeastern state. ``The problem is
that the government hasn't built reservoirs, explored underground
water supplies, irrigated peasant properties or distributed land
among those who have no means to survive.''
   From the 1500s well into the 19th century, the northeast was a
productive area, but the wealth stayed with a few.
   Agriculture led the economic activity, and the vast open spaces
lent themselves to production of Brazil's most precious commodities
at the time: cattle, cotton, sugar, tobacco and much later, coffee.
   The Portuguese crown handed out large stretches of land to
nobles and deserving soldiers. But far from central government
control in the South, northeast landowners set ``wild-west'' laws
for peasant ``subjects'' and used private armies to chase
individual farmers from modest-sized lands.
   Such scenes have been pointedly described by Brazil's leading
novelist, Jorge Amado, in ``Gabriela Clove and Cinnamon,''
``Bahia'' and most recently ``Showdown.''
   Successive governments have made promises to wrench the inland
population from medieval-like poverty, but gun battles over land
and vast misuse of government funds in the region are still common.
   The military government that governed from 1964 through 1985
built dams for hydroelectric power, roads, soccer stadiums and
stretched electricty lines across the dry, cracked land. One tough
military president, the late Gen. Emilio Medici, who is said to
have condoned the torture of political opponents, was on the verge
of tears when he saw the northeast's poverty first hand.
   But the grandiose projects of the military government did little
to ease the average northeasterner's lack of food, jobs, water and
land.
   A common belief among Northesterns is that the few direct
investments in their social concerns, such as food and water
distributions during droughts and emergency work-relief jobs, were
turned to political advantage by local land-owning politicians who
pass along favors to those who vote for them.
   ``It is in the interests of the landowners to maintain the
region in utter poverty,'' claimed Maria Luiza Fontenelle, mayor of
Fortaleza, capital of Ceara and the northeast's largest city, with
a population of 1.6 million.
   ``When people are poor they depend upon favors to survive.''
   According to Bishop Jose Rodrigues of the Roman Catholic Church
in the hinterlands of Bahia, mayors control local unions and decide
who gets access to government health care, jobs and other benefits.
   When the military stepped down and civilian government returned
to Brazil in 1985, hopes for widespread social reforms ran high.
But many northeasterners say civilian rule for them has been a
hollow triumph.
   Last year, the region sold $4.4 billion worth of fruit, nuts,
cocoa, sugar, tobacco and petroleum to southern Brazil and foreign
countries but received only $1 billion in government investments.
   Promises of a land reform, irrigation of 2.5 million acres of
land and 2 million jobs were slashed as the government of President
Jose Sarney sought to to cut a massive budget deficit, control
runaway inflation projected at 600 percent annually and meet
payments on a $121 billion foreign debt.
   Most significantly, Brazil's proposed new constitution makes
virtually impossible a long-promised land reform to distribute the
46 percent of rural properties owned by just 1.2 percent of the
population. The Catholic church has accused the government of
bowing to powerful landowners on the issue.
   But political scientists say the northeast's problems are fast
becoming problems for the rest of the country, most particularly
the more affluent South.
   northeasterners, for example, now occupied whole shanty towns in
the major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, pressing already
precarious social and health services and pushing up crime rates.
   ``Brazil will never be a stable democracy ... nor a developed
country without resolving its vast inequalities,'' said one
political scientist, Helio Jaguaribe.
   But the political balance also may be shifting.
   In the 1986 gubernatorial elections, northeasterners chose four
governors who are considered politically progressive and more
likely to contest landowner power.
   Mayor Fontenelle of Fortaleza, for example, is a member of the
Radical Worker's Party.
   At the same time, the Roman Catholic Church presses on its own
for change.
   Bishop Rodrigues has helped rural workers in seven of his 11
doceses take control of local labor unions, often resulting in gun
and stick battles between private armies of conservative mayors and
local farmers.
   In Jucas, a town of 8,000 people 300 miles west of Fortaleza,
the Rev. Hans Stecker, a German priest who arrived 28 years ago,
wages a relentless battle with Mayor Jose Fagundes, also the town's
largest landowner.
   The priest has built a hospital, 39 schools and pre-schools and
started health and education programs. Stecker said that in
response to his projects the three-term mayor cut church's
telephone lines and prohibited the teaching of religion in town
schools.
   ``In some towns,'' said political scientist Guimaraes, ``the
local priest can't leave home without a gun.''

<TEXT>
   High in the hills overlooking Budapest,
communist Hungary's new rich are carving out one of Eastern
Europe's most exclusive residential enclaves.
   While thousands of Hungarians still wait up to 10 years for new
apartments and homes, construction of fashionable modern villas for
successful entrepreneurs and professionals is booming in the Buda
hills outside the city.
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said a longtime owner of
a modest stucco home not far from Sandor Endroedy street, where
many of the new homes are being built.
   ``Everywhere you look, another big one is going up,'' said the
resident, asking not to be identified.
   Communist officials throughout Eastern Europe have long laid
claim to some of the most desirable pre-World War II residences in
Budapest and other East bloc capitals. But there is no parallel to
the building boom now being financed by Budapest's wealthy.
   Throughout the area around Endroedy and Tuske streets, workers
are busy completing three- and four-story homes and landscaped
estates owned by Hungary's top professionals. They include medical
specialists, lawyers, art dealers, popular entertainers and private
entrepeneurs who have parlayed high-demand services, such as auto
repair and real estate, into substantial profits.
   From their terraces and balconies, homeowners have a commanding
view of the city's skyline and the Danube River.
   High concrete walls ensure cozy seclusion. Expensive
Western-made automobiles are parked in many of the new two-car
garages.
   Economic reforms introduced in the late 1960s encouraged limited
private ownership and enterprise. Those activities were allowed to
expand in the 1970s, and small private companies and cooperative
partnerships flourished.
   People supplemented incomes with second jobs, by running shops
or offering sought-after professional services. The lucky ones have
achieved perhaps the highest standard of living in the Soviet bloc.
   Despite a growing foreign debt of $18 billion, 18 percent
inflation and recent government austerity measures, the nation's
successful professionals still seem to have plenty of cash to spend
on luxuries once reserved for the party elite.
   With few opportunities to reinvest the accumulated wealth, the
newly rich have gone on a building spree.
   Many of the new homes in the Buda hills cost more than the
equivalent of $150,000, state housing officials estimate.
   Most Hungarians must set their sights far lower. Thousands of
families still wait in austere housing projects and decaying
apartment buildings for new lodgings that better suit their needs.
   Ivan T. Berend, president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
and a leading economic reformer, has called Hungary's housing
shortage ``the nation's No. 1 social problem.''
   Erzsebet Rikli, head of Budapest's Housing Authority, said
66,000 people are on the agency's waiting list for new apartments.
She said the average waiting period for young singles is eight to
10 years. Married couples with one child wait about five years,
while families with three or more children can hope for a new
apartment in about a year.
   Far from criticizing the upsurge in posh new developments like
the Buda hills housing, Hungarian government officials say they are
an important part of a broader program designed to expand private
housing ventures.
   ``These private and cooperative efforts are extremely important
in solving our current housing crisis,'' Rikli said. ``We encourage
people to take the initiative.''
   In recent years, the Hungarian government has gradually reduced
its involvement in new housing construction, relying increasingly
on private and cooperative efforts to fill the gap.
   Of the 10,000 new apartments built in Budapest each year, only
1,500 are now constructed by the state.
   The state is also putting apartments up for sale in many housing
complexes hastily erected in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Housing costs remain high despite new government credits to ease
the burden.
   The average monthly salary is 6,000 forint ($130), while the
Budapest Housing Authority estimates that the average new
two-bedroom apartment sells for 1.3 million forint ($28,260).
   Austerity measures designed to curb inflation and reduce the
foreign debt are further reducing the buying power of many
Hungarians, leading to growing resentment at the ostentatious
lifestyle of those in the Buda hills.
   ``There is growing social tension,'' said Rikli. ``The tolerance
level is getting lower.''

<TEXT>
   Government leaders appear to have forgone for
the moment the uncustomary practice of lambasting the United
States, an ally and investor of long standing, but they may start
again at election time.
   ``Having the audacity to bash a superpower, even if it's your
largest trading partner and strongest friend, is one way to rally
voters,'' an Asian diplomat said.
   Parliamentary elections must be held by December 1989 in this
island republic of 2.6 million people but are expected to be called
about a year earlier.
   The People's Action Party of Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew has
been in power since 1959 and won its seventh election in 1984,
capturing 77 of the 79 Parliament seats. It won only 63 percent of
the popular vote, however, compared to 76 percent the time before.
   No viable opposition is in sight, but Lee's party has lost the
affections of some voters, and its authoritarian style grates on an
electorate that is becoming better educated and more affluent.
   Under his leadership, Singapore has been transformed from a
shabby British colonial outpost to a regional banking, industrial
and communications center.
   Direct U.S. investment is $2.3 billion and increasing by about
$200 million a year, according to U.S. statistics. The largest
private employer is Seagate Technology, a U.S. disk-drive
manufacturer that began with 50 workers six years ago and now
employs 13,000.
   Lee, the longest-serving democratically elected leader in the
world, forged close links with Washington years ago.
   He was invited to address a joint session of Congress in 1985
and is among the few heads of Asian governments to be outspoken in
support of keeping U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   So why did his subordinates aim harsh words at the United
States, adding it to a list of targets including otherwise
unspecified ``foreign powers,'' foreign journalists, Marxist
conspirators, Australia, and international human rights and legal
oganizations?
   One European diplomat suggested tensions involving both the
coming election and other impending changes were responsible.
   The prime minister will be 65 in September and has indicated he
may retire from office.
   It has been confirmed that the constitution will be amended to
give executive powers to the largely ceremonial presidency.
Speculation is widespread that Lee will be the first executive
president.
   Former President C.V. Devan Nair and other critics say the
government used the specter of foreign menace to deflect attention
from a joint statement in April by nine former political detainees,
who said they were falsely arrested as alleged subversives a year
ago and physically abused.
   Earlier this year, Washington said it will remove Singapore,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, the fast-growing ``economic
dragons'' of Asia, from the Generalized System of Preferences. The
policy takes effect in January.
   Under the preference system, certain goods from developing
countries have duty-free access to the United States. The four
countries no longer are regarded as developing.
   The other three took it in stride, but Singapore said it was
betrayed because Washington promised to retain the special
treatment if it tightened laws against patent and copyright piracy,
which it did.
   A carefully arranged demonstration was staged at the U.S.
Embassy.
   Relations grew worse May 7 when Singapore expelled E. Mason
Hendrickson, first secretary in the U.S. Embassy's political
section.
   Hendrickson was accused of meddling in domestic politics by
encouraging several lawyers to run as independents against
government party candidates in the next election.
   Washington said his actions were nothing more than normal
diplomatic information-gathering. It ousted a Singaporean of
equivalent rank from the United States in response.
   Singapore alleged that Hendrickson and other State Department
officials had dealings with Francis Seow, 59, a former
solicitor-general and president of the Law Society.
   Seow has been in jail for a year under the Internal Security
Act, which allows detention without trial, to keep him from
``acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore,''
in the Home Ministry's words.
   Lee said charges of meddling should not be allowed to harm
long-term relations between Singapore and the United States.
   He told Parliament his country was ``not condemning the criminal
designs of an enemy, but regretting the misdemeanors of a friend.
... We should not harm our long-term basic interests when we
protest against this unwarranted American interference.''
   His moderate tone contrasted with shrill rhetoric from others.
Goh Chok Tong, deputy prime minister, threatened to reduce the
number of diplomats allowed at the U.S. Embassy unless Washington
mended its ways.
   Goh, 46, who is positioned to succeed Lee, said the country
``can move into a more neutral and non-aligned posture.''
   His remarks were made during five days of debate on a motion
supporting ``firm action of the government to prevent our country
from being subverted, whether by Marxists, Communists, Western
powers or other foreign interest groups.''
   A co-sponsor, Goh Choon Kang, likened the country's situation to
that of ``a girl in a bar being molested by a sex maniac.''

   Michael Dukakis may be leading
George Bush in the presidential polls, but when it comes to
handwriting, the race is a draw.
   That's the conclusion of the National Coalition to Stamp Out
Chicken Scratching, organized as a publicity stunt for Scripto
Corp., a national pen manufacturer based in this Los Angeles suburb.
   A coalition expert analyzed the penmanship of the various
candidates in both parties and concluded Tuesday that Dukakis led
the legibility race among the Democrats and that Bush's John
Hancock was the clearest in the GOP pack.
   The group declined to endorse either Bush or Dukakis in the
write-in contest, said publicist Bette Dragoun, pleading
non-partisanship.
   ``We believe the next president should have respect for rule
Number 1 in basic fundamental interpersonal communication _
handwriting should be legible,'' said Charles Lehman, a Portland,
Ore., writing expert who signed on as executive director of the
coalition.
   In true non-partisan fashion, the coalition voted a split ticket
when it came to naming the sloppiest scrawlers in the presidential
race.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon's scribble was dubbed worst among the
Democrats. The most impenetrable hieroglyphics in the GOP were
those of Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who dropped out early,
presumably because he saw the handwriting on the wall.

<TEXT>
   When Ralph Shewell, a high school
history teacher, challenged his class to resurrect a 1920s slang
expression, the typical reaction was, ``Banana Oil!''
   So to speak, anyway. In the 1920s, the term ``banana oil'' was
as common an expression of disbelief as its contemporary
counterparts, ``No way!'' or ``Get out of here!'' Shewell said.
   Shewell offered his Westminster High School class extra credits
if they could coax someone in the national news media into using
the phrase before June 14.
   On Tuesday, the day of the deadline, one effort bore fruit when
a letter from sophomore Nicky Naylor appeared in a column by
syndicated columnist Ann Landers.
   In her published letter, the student wrote, ``If everyone who
reads your column uses the expression, I'm sure that by the end of
the school year (June 15) something might happen. ... Maybe this
letter will prove that one unknown teenager can make something
happen.''
   ``Dear Unknown Teenager,'' Landers replied. ``Today is June 14.
It would be a miracle if a national news commentator said `banana
oil,' but maybe one of your local disc jockeys will read this, say
those immortal words on the air, and you can persuade your teacher
to count it. Please let us know what happens.''
   Shewell said he may count the appearance of ``banana oil'' in
the column for the extra credit. He said he came up with the
challenge while his class was studying the fads of the 1920s,
``just to motivate them to get interested in the times.''
   Ms. Naylor, 16, said she sent her letter to Landers because the
columns ``go everywhere.''
   ``I was gonna write to Dan Rather,'' Ms. Naylor added, but ``I
kind of figured I wouldn't hear anything about that at all.''

Gene Jankowski have admitted during an affiliates' gathering at the
Century Plaza Hotel over the past several days that poor promotion
has hurt CBS.
   During a reportedly tempestuous closed-door meeting Sunday
between CBS executives and affiliate station chiefs, the network
was repeatedly assailed for lacking a focused strategy to improve
its lagging ratings.
   ``There were more brass knuckles in there than I've seen in a
long time,'' on participant told Daily Variety after emerging from
the five-hour meeting, which last 90 minutes more than scheduled.
   ``If there is a three-to-five year plan, we don't have a sense
of it,'' said Leslie G. Arrie, vice president and general manager
of CBS affiliate WIVB of Buffalo, N.Y.
   Among the moves announced during the affiliates meeting was the
departure of Warren Spellman, the in-house chief of CBS
advertising-promotion department. He will be replaced by Michael
Mischler, the advertising and promotion vice president for King
World, the syndicator of such top game shows as ``Jeopardy'' and
``Wheel of Fortune.''
   Tisch and Jankowski said CBS had no plans to fire its outside
advertising agency of Backer, Spielvogel, Bates Inc.
   ``We didn't do a good job,'' said Tisch of the network's past
promotional efforts, but added: ``The ad agency wasn't the
problem.''
   Tisch told affiliates that the network had ``spent the
equivalent'' of $300 million annually in advertising time to
promote its programs. ``The efficiency of that expenditure could be
greatly improved,'' he said.

   North Dakotans rejected a lottery for the second time in 18
months Tuesday, while Virginians chose Democrat L.F. Payne Jr. as
their newest congressman and a conservative L.L. Bean heiress lost
her bid for a U.S. House nomination from Maine.
   With 77 percent of the North Dakota vote in, the lottery was
opposed by 41,505 voters or 59 percent and favored by 28,391 voters
or 41 percent.
   ``It would seem to me (the vote is) a decisive expression of the
will of the people, and I would hope that the proponents would
accept the decision of the voters of North Dakota,'' said former
Gov. Arthur Link.
   But backers said the lottery question probably would be on the
general election ballot in November.
   Payne, developer of a ski and golf resort, defeated the
Republican candidate, former White House aide Linda Arey, in a
special election in the southside 5th District. He succeeds Rep.
W.C. ``Dan'' Daniel, a conservative Democrat who died of a heart
attack in January while serving his 10th term.
   With all the vote counted, Payne had 55,406 votes or 59 percent
to Ms. Arey's 38,086 votes or 41 percent.
   In Maine's southern 1st District, Linda Bean-Jones was edged by
senatorial aide Edward S. O'Meara for the GOP nomination to oppose
Democratic Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, a former two-term governor.
   With 96 percent of the vote counted, O'Meara had 15,313 votes or
52 percent and Bean-Jones had 14,102 votes or 48 percent.
   ``Recounts don't seem to pay off,'' Bean-Jones said. ``I'm still
going to be around. We're not going to disappear. I feel I have a
role to play in politics.''
   South Carolina also had congressional primaries, and in the only
challenge to an incumbent, three-term Democratic Rep. Robin Tallon
easily turned back retired postal worker Luther Lighty in the 6th
District. With 98 percent of the vote in, Tallon had 64,548 votes
or 89 percent and Lighty had 8,262 votes or 11 percent.
   Besides the lottery vote, North Dakotans also had the
last-in-the-nation presidential primary. But because of its late
date, no Democrats bothered to file and on the Republican side, the
ballot listed only Vice President George Bush _ who long has had
the nomination wrapped up _ and Mary Jane Rachner, a retired
teacher who says the spirits of her late mother and grandmother
told her to run for president.
   With 16 GOP delegates at stake, Bush was piling up 94 percent of
the vote.

   The North Dakota lottery was defeated in November 1986, the
first time a state had failed to approve a state-run lottery.
Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia currently have
lotteries.
   Backers said a lottery would raise $7 million in new revenue for
the state, which is struggling through a depressed economy.
   ``The atmosphere this time is a lot better,'' said Gorman King
Sr., a Mandan businessman who has led the drive for a lottery.
   Link, a longtime foe of state-sanctioned gaming, found himself
joined in opposition by some of North Dakota's existing charitable
gaming operators, who feared a lottery would cut into their
business.
   Bean-Jones, granddaughter of outdoors outfitter L.L. Bean and
founder of a defunct conservative publication known as The Maine
Paper, tapped her personal wealth for her first political race,
spending $455,000 out of her own pocket. O'Meara, a longtime
district aide to Sen. William S. Cohen, spent between $60,000 and
$65,000.
   Because of a tradition of neutrality in primaries, the moderate
O'Meara was unable to draw active support from top Republicans,
although his rhetoric that at times suggested the soul of the state
party was at stake.
   Bean-Jones stressed her business background as a real estate
agent and entrepreneur, contrasting it against O'Meara's years as a
government insider.
   Last week she was quoted in the Kennebec Journal in Augusta as
calling the minimum wage an ``oppressive'' law that keeps people
from working and saying she would vote to abolish the $3.35
standard. She later issued a statement saying she thought she had
been asked about a pending bill to increase the minimum wage, but
her statement did not disclaim her comments in the story.
   In Virginia, neither Ms. Arey, 43, nor Payne, 42, was well known
in the 5th 10th District, and neither had sought elective office
previously.
   Vice President George Bush came to campaign for Ms. Arey on
Sunday in Danville, a textile and tobacco center. Payne stressed
his ties to the state's Democratic Party and received backing from
Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Ms. Arey and Payne both had their party's nominations to compete
for the seat again in November, but it was considered likely that
the loser in Tuesday's election would withdraw from the race.
   In South Carolina, Tallon beat Lighty two years ago with 90
percent of the vote. Former Rep. John Jenrette, convicted in the
Abscam scandal, had considered entering the race, but decided to
sit it out.

   The cycle of terror and hatred in Israel and
the occupied territories has created a psychological barrier
between Jews and Palestinians that distances prospects for peace in
the Middle East, social scientists say.
   ``We Israelis and Palestinians both feel trapped in this
conflict. If we don't master our emotions, they will master us,''
Bernard Sabella, a Palestinian sociologist, told an unusual joint
seminar of Jewish and Arab social scientists on Tuesday.
   About 400 left-wing Israelis and several dozen Arabs attended
the day-long conference aimed at discussing how to minimize the
psychological damage caused by the violence.
   During the conference, Israelis poured out guilt feelings about
being occupiers and Palestinians spoke of the pain of their
six-month-old uprising.
   Many voiced concern that the prolonged conflict, which dates to
early in the century when the British ruled Palestine, is causing
children to grow up in hatred, making peace unattainable.
   ``Each society, the Israelis and the Palestinian, feels a need
to politicize their children. We socialize our children into the
conflict. It is a central element in their willingness to continue
it,'' said Sabella, who teaches at Bethlehem University.
   But he said the Palestinians, after 21 years of Israeli military
rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, had no choice but to stage
the uprising.
   ``We are suffering from the intefadeh,'' Sabella said, using the
Arabic term for uprising. ``It is a trip, not a happy trip, but a
trip we have been forced to take.''
   Since the rebellion began Dec. 8 in the occupied lands, more
than 205 Palestinians have been killed. Two Israelis have also died.
   The conference was held at a hotel in primarily Jewish west
Jerusalem because no institution could be found to sponsor the
meeting.
   The Israelis who took part were not typical of the population,
which polls show is becoming more hawkish. Most at the session were
critical of their country's treatment of Arabs and of its failure
to do enough to get peace talks started.
   Psychoanalyst Joachim Stein said Israeli Jews are largely
denying that the violence is at a crisis point. Or they are
rationalizing tough tactics against Arabs as a necessary defense
against threats to their security, he said.
   Stein said centuries of persecution and the more recent
experience of being surrounded by enemy Arab countries has made
Jews accustomed to feeling like victims.
   ``There is a complex here where the conqueror always feels he is
conquered,'' he said. ``We continue to be victims even though
others are the victims. How do we emerge out of this vicious
cycle?''
   About 20 Jewish psychologists also debated the question in a
heated two-hour encounter group. One of the topics was a string of
recent fires blamed on Palestinians that have razed more than
25,000 acres of trees and pastures.
   Pedro Rothman, a teacher, said that because of the fires it was
difficult for him to educate his pupils to empathize with the Arabs.
   ``As much as I identify with the Palestinian problem, I get up
every morning and I see that they are burning down forests and it
really hurts,'' he said. ``I was taught to think of trees as being
like human beings.''
   But, countered Nitza Aminov, ``if you have trouble dealing with
burning forests, then show the pupils a picture of the baby from
Gaza and ask them how they think she feels.'' She was referring to
a 9-month-old Arab girl whose eye was knocked out recently by a
rubber bullet.
   The army has apologized for the incident.
   Other Jewish social scientists said they felt an identity crisis
because the army's heavy hand in quelling riots conflicted with
democratic and other values.
   ``I have this fear that we're losing our own sense of justice.
This is a terrible thing for a nation to lose,'' said psychologist
Haviva Bar.

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor has filed a
$30 million libel suit against the New York Post over a story that
quoted her as saying, ``Hitler had his good points,'' according to
her attorney.
   The lawsuit says the comments were falsely attributed to Miss
Gabor and that she was emotionally distressed by the report, said
Paul Monzione, an attorney with Melvin Belli's law firm in San
Francisco.
   The lawsuit, which names the New York Post Co. and several
unidentified individuals, was filed Monday in the Los Angeles
County Superior Court here, a clerk said.
   An editor at the Post referred questions to attorney Charles
Moerdler, who had left his office and was not available by
telephone Tuesday afternoon. He did not return The Associated
Press' telephone call Tuesday night.
   Monzione said the Post's April 22 story described a
confrontation that Miss Gabor had with another guest on The Regis
Philbin Show, a talk show televised in the New York City area.
   ``She was so upset by the confrontation on live television she
began making statements and comments, but at no time did she ever
say the things that the Post stated were her statements,'' Monzione
said.
   The lawyer said the alleged libel described Zsa Zsa as getting
into a limousine, drinking some vodka and then launching into a
diatribe _ ``the gist of which was that Hitler had his good
points.''
   ``Miss Gabor is not a drinker and never has been, and so to
attribute that practice to her is just flat out wrong,'' Monzione
said. ``But even more damaging is attributing the statement to her
that `Hitler had his good points.'''
   Monzione said the newspaper subsequently published a retraction,
saying it was unable to confirm that Miss Gabor had made the
statement. But he said the retraction wasn't given sufficient
prominence and should have unequivocally stated that the
Hungarian-born actress never made the statement.

   On the eve of his 56th birthday, Gov. Mario
Cuomo said he may not get a present from his wife, Matilda, because
she is angry over his attempts to cut funding for a state council
she runs.
   Cuomo, facing a potential $900 million budget deficit, has
proposed cutting all sorts of spending, including $500,000 of the
$4 million budget for the Council on Children and Families.
   ``She was very unhappy, but businesslike,'' joked Cuomo, whose
birthday is today. ``She said, `Why did you do it to me?' I said,
`We didn't do it to you.'''
   Cuomo said he then offered her the same deal he made to his
cabinet members and other agency heads facing cuts.
   ``I said, `If you can find a better cut, we'll consider it,'''
he said Tuesday. ``She said, `Good, we'll start with your birthday
present.'''

   Presbyterians overwhelmingly adopted a major
statement on Christian responsibilities in a nuclear age Tuesday
after lengthy revisions to mollify members who feared the church
was embracing civil disobedience.
   The General Assembly of the 3 million-member Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) broke into applause at the announcement of the 502-68
vote. Adoption of ``Christian Obedience in the Nuclear Age'' ended
a process that began in 1983 when congregations asked the church
how to deal with tax resisters.
   Also Tuesday, the Rev. James E. Andrews was narrowly elected to
a second four-year term as stated clerk of the General Assembly. He
defeated Harriet Nelson, a lay leader from California, 323-298.
   Andrews, 59, said he had been ``sent a message'' by the narrow
margin to heal the divisions in the denomination stemming from its
formation in the 1983 merger of the United Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.).
   In other action, the assembly recommended a higher minimum wage
and called for a national dialogue on the status of Americans
Indians. It also began moving through suggested actions on
abortion, pornography, health costs and religious freedom in an
effort to pass resolutions before the nine day meeting ends
Wednesday.
   Conservatives within the denomination have blamed declining
membership on what they perceive to be increasingly liberal stances
by the church's bureaucracy under Andrews. There also have been
complaints that the church was not attentive enough to evangelism.
   On Saturday, a committee nominated Nelson among seven candidates
for the post, surprising many who expected the panel to nominate
two people, including Andrews. In nominating Mrs. Nelson, the Rev.
J. Randolph Taylor called Andrews ``a reminder of our divided
past'' and said the ``church needs a sense of newness.''
   Andrews, who was stated clerk of the smaller PCUS from 1973 to
1983, said he thought the vote showed the delegates believed his
``faults are correctable.'' He promised he would be ``very active
in ... bringing in various viewpoints, various factions together in
a denomination that's growing up.''
   He also said many of the church's problems reflect the
difficulty of consolidating the old Atlanta headquarters of the
PCUS and the New York headquarters of the UPCUSA in Louisville, Ky.
Most of the move is expected to be complete by the end of this year.
   Nelson, who comes from the UPCUSA, did not comment on the vote
but said prior to the election that she would do whatever the
church asked of her.
   The stated clerk is the chief constitutional officer of the
church and represents the church in ecumenical bodies, oversees the
preparation for and operation of the annual assembly and runs a
staff of 65 people with a budget of about $7 million. The post
carries a salary of $62,000 a year.
   The heavily revised document on Christian obediance in a nuclear
age lays out ways the church can deal with government resisters but
stresses that normal behavior is to obey civilian authorities. The
paper also says nuclear war is immoral, and nuclear deterrence ``as
an adequate, permanent means to national security ... is not
morally defensible.''
   Groups working on the paper reviewed the policy statement and
recommendations line-by-line, revising it throughout to indicate
obeying the government ``is normally the case.''
   However, recognizing ``God alone is Lord of the conscience,''
the paper says, ``Under certain circumstances, however,
non-cooperation with, or disobedience to, duly constituted
authorities has been deemed an appropriate Christian response.''
   The paper was revised to delete language that suggested the
church provide financial support for members who refuse to pay
taxes in protest against military spending.
   Nevertheless, the paper requests church agencies to set up a
voluntary Fund for Obedience to a Higher Authority ``for the
assistance of those who suffer financial loss or difficulty as a
result of acts of conscience.''
   The paper also was changed to include a statement that military
service can be an acceptable response to conscience.
   The adoption came after several committee members told the
assembly they had intended to vote against the paper, but had
changed their minds as the deliberations went on.
   Fountain Odom of Charlotte, N.C., a one-time unsuccessful Senate
candidate, told the assembly he first felt the paper was the
``epitome of naive simplicity.'' But Odom said the final document
``is true to the gospel, (and) allows strong, divergent emotional
views'' within the church.''
   With no discussion, the assembly adopted a lengthy discussion of
pornography that concludes it is fundamentally caused by sexism.
The recommendations reiterate the church's call for the enactment
of the Equal Rights Amendment.
   The statement also directs church officials to return to the
assembly in two years with a recommended public policy statement.
In the meantime, the church's Mission Responsibility Through
Investment Committee is to investigate the pornography industry, to
determine whether church assets are invested with companies that
profit from pornography, including telephone services.
   Earlier Tuesday, the assembly voted to set up a ``national
dialogue'' on American Indians in response to President Reagan's
comments in Moscow saying the U.S. government had ``humored''
native Americans by establishing reservations.
   The assembly also recommended a hike in the minimum wage from
$3.35 per hour to ``its historical level of 50 percent of the
average non-supervisory, non-agricultural wage and provide for
regular increases that will keep the minimum wage at an adequate
level to lift people out of poverty.''
   Congress currently is considering legislation that would raise
the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour, the first increase since 1981.
Such an increase would meet the 50 percent criterion called for by
the Presbyterians.

Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Spanks, pinches and other ``aversive'' therapy
techniques would be outlawed for treating severely handicapped and
autistic youngsters under measure approved by the Massachusetts
House.
   The legislation approved Tuesday and sent to the Senate was
prompted by the 1985 death of a young autistic patient at Behavior
Research Institute, a treatment center for severely disturbed
youngsters in Providence, R.I., that has residential facilities in
Massachusetts.
   After the death, the state Office for Children attempted to ban
the use of aversive therapy, an aggressive form of ``behavior
modification'' using rewards and escalating punishments.
   But the state's courts overturned the ban, siding with the
institute and some parents who said that aversive therapy is a
lifesaving treatment for the most extremely self-destructive
patients who are not helped by any other program.
   ``They call it treatment. They call it behavioral modification.
It is corporal punishment,'' said Rep. Paul Kollios. He said the
therapy would constitute child abuse or assault in any other
setting.
   Rep. Thomas Walsh offered an amendment that would allow judges
to certify aversive therapy programs and order the treatment for
specific individuals.
   ``It is not corporal punishment. It is a lifesaving treatment.
Parents whose children receive it support it almost to the
person,'' said Rep. Philip Travis, who supported the amendment.
   But proponents of the ban refused to consider the amendment, and
the House rejected it.
   ``We have to be naive, if not silly, to think that a court
monitor and a treatment plan is going to ensure what is not
abusive,'' said Rep. David Cohen. ``The people doing the whacking,
the slapping and the shackling are among the lowest-paid people in
the mental health system.''

   Searing drought that has withered fields in
America's breadbasket could escalate into full-scale disaster
unless rain comes soon, the nation's top farm official says.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told lawmakers Tuesday
that the government is providing aid to ease ``what could well be a
catastrophe.'' He said it was ``still a little bit soon to say we
have a general disaster nationwide, but the potential is there.''
   Wheat fields in Montana and the Dakotas already are in bad
shape, he said, and additional weeks of scorching temperatures and
no rain could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt and across the
South.
   Corn and soybeans are drawing on moisture stored in soil and
remain viable, he said. He added that July weather is more critical
to the crops and good rainfall from now on could do much to
revitalize them.
   Lyng answered questions Tuesday morning from the Senate
Agriculture Committee and returned to Capitol Hill in the afternoon
for a talk with House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de
la Garza, D-Texas.
   Lawmakers are talking about congressional action to help ease
farm money woes arising from the drought. Both House and Senate
have formed task forces to work with Lyng in formulating a bill the
White House would accept.
   Such a bill would involve a hefty payout and Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., warned his colleagues against ``disparate legislative
initiatives hung on various bills and flying in from various places
with no certainty that the administration would accept them.''
   ``There may be no rain,'' Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said,
``but there's going to be a rain of various proposals with everyone
trying to outdo one another, whoever gets to the press first.''
   Lyng said it was too early to push such a measure now but said
it was important to be ready to do so before Congress adjourns this
fall.
   ``I guess the best thing for us to do is pray for rain,'' Lyng
said. He noted that USDA already is providing an array of emergency
aid. payments.
   But he continued to reject opening Conservation Reserve Program
acres for cutting hay and grazing livestock, a move sought by
farmers facing livestock feed shortages because of the drought.
   The program is a special 1985 plan to take 45 million highly
erodible acres out of production for a decade and plant them in
grasses and trees. It is separate from USDA's annual conservation
program, which already has been opened for haying and grazing in
more than 900 counties.
   Stock producers in Montana, the Dakotas and Minnesota are among
those pushing for permission to use hay on the reserve program
acreage.
   ``I don't know of anything that irritates my producers more than
to drive right by all this hay as they drive their cattle south,''
Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told Lyng.
   The drought already is driving up crop prices as wheat fields
turn brown. Higher prices in turn are shrinking government
income-support payments for farmers.
   Some farmers are thus faced with the prospect of having no crop
they can take to market at the same time that their federal
payments are drying up. And some may be forced to repay part of the
advance income-support payments they already have received.
   ``The emergency is upon us,'' declared Sen. John Melcher,
D-Mont. ``The disaster is here.''
   ``If the skies open up, it looks like we have lost 40 percent to
50 percent of the crop,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.
   One concept under discussion among lawmakers would guarantee
minimum income-support payments to farmers.
   These amounts, formally called deficiency payments, represent
the difference between market prices and target prices that are
adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture. As market prices
move up, the difference becomes smaller and smaller and the farmers
receive less from the government.
   The system is supposed to work that way, except that when
drought destroys crops the farmers do not receive the benefit of
the higher market prices.
   The shrinking deficiency payments mean cost estimates for farm
programs ``are moving downward in the hundreds of millions of
dollars,'' said Ewen M. Wilson, assistant secretary of agriculture
for economics.
   Lawmakers are talking about recycling the savings and using them
to bolster farm incomes in drought areas.

<BYLINE>Baker Departure Viewed as Sign of Lame-Duck Reagan Presidency
^By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howard Baker Jr. says his resignation as White
House chief of staff isn't a sign of lame-duck status for President
Reagan, but it's being read that way just the same.
   One former senior White House official said after Baker's
departure was announced Tuesday that the remaining days of the
Reagan presidency amount to a caretaker period. ``It's just a
hold-the-line thing,'' said the former official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Baker himself conceded in an interview that the lame-duck label
is probably not far away and that other staff members are sure to
leave as the clock runs down on the Reagan administration.
   And Baker said the last major objective of a Reagan presidency _
a strategic arms agreement with the Soviet Union _ probably is not
possible for this president.
   ``While it is not impossible, it is not probable that we can do
that, but he certainly can narrow the differences and hand his
successor major progress in this field,'' Baker said after the
surprise announcement that he was leaving the White House,
effective July 1.
   Baker will be succeeded by his deputy, Kenneth Duberstein, 44,
who, like Baker, has a reputation as a conciliator and shrewd
negotiator, particularly with Congress.
   Duberstein will be responsible for directing the flow of paper
and visitors to the president's office and coordinating Reagan's
schedule. He will supervise a White House staff of about 325 people
including speech writers, counselors, press officials and policy
specialists.
   Along with Baker, White House communications chief Thomas
Griscom said he, too, will be leaving soon, though he did not say
when. Griscom and Baker have been longtime allies, dating back to
Baker's service in the Senate.
   In discussing his departure, Baker did strike himself from the
list of possible running mates with George Bush on the Republican
presidential ticket.
   ``You don't turn down requests of that sort if they are made,''
Baker said. ``It's really something that is presumptuous in the
extreme to say, `No, I would not do that.' But I do not want to do
that, I do not expect to do that, and I think it's extremely
unlikely I would be asked to do that.''
   Baker said he had told Bush he was quitting, but did not raise
the issue of whether he might be available as a running mate.
Laughingly, Baker added, ``More important, he's never discussed
that with me.''
   When Duberstein replaces Baker, there will be slightly more than
six months remaining in Reagan's presidency. It will be only four
months before Reagan's successor is chosen.
   ``He will be a lame duck at some point but it will be after
Labor Day, in my view, at least,'' Baker said. ``And who knows _ he
may not be then, if we're making progress especially on foreign
policy issues.''
   Reagan, asked during a picture-taking session if Baker's
departure was evidence of a fading administration, replied: ``Well,
I don't think it should be. He had his reasons for what he's had to
do. We're going to miss him, of course.''
   Baker joined the White House on Feb. 27, 1987, abandoning his
own presidential ambitions to help Reagan dig out from the
Iran-Contra scandal. He replaced the embattled Donald T. Regan, who
was at odds with Nancy Reagan and bore the scars of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Baker said his objective was to see Reagan ``through the turmoil
of the Iran-Contra situation ... see that he wasn't immobilized
during that period as Richard Nixon was during the Watergate
hearings ... and see that he didn't lose any foreign policy
opportunities, arms control.''
   ``And I think that is clearly accomplished. So, this is a nice
breakpoint and it's a good time'' to go.
   Moreover, he noted that his wife, Joy, has been chronically ill
for some time, and that his 86-year-old stepmother, Irene, has been
hospitalized with stomach pains. ``I feel a little like the man who
walks around with a black cloud over his head,'' Baker said.
   Looking back over his 16 months as chief of staff, Baker said,
``If there is a legacy, it is that we brought cooperation and
direction to the White House and to the staff. It was really in a
pretty low state when we got here.
   ``And I couldn't ascertain that there was any agenda much,''
Baker said. ``We had to sort of invent one and take it to the
president.''

<HEAD>New England Life Insurance Company Bought $2,000 Worth of Wright's
Book</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington lobbyist, a Boston insurance
company, a third-grade teacher and a member of Congress were among
bulk buyers of a book that netted House Speaker Jim Wright nearly
$55,000 in royalties.
   Wright, D-Texas, mentioned the purchasers Tuesday when reporters
asked him who had bought multiple copies of his 1984 book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   Critics of the speaker have alleged that the book, which was
sold primarily in bulk and at political rallies, was a thinly
disguised way for lobbyists and others seeking favors to give money
to Wright, who was House majority leader at the time. The book deal
is among the items being examined by the House ethics committee in
its investigation of Wright.
   Wright has defended his receipt of royalties from the slim,
117-page volume as proper and contends the attacks on him are an
election-year gambit by Republicans. Wright is to be chairman of
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next month.
   The New England life insurance company in Boston was among bulk
buyers of the book. Senior vice president Gordon MacKay said the
company had invited Wright to speak to a management group about
three years ago, and bought $2,000 worth of Wright's books instead
of giving him an honorarium.
   There is a limit on the amount of honoraria a member of Congress
can receive each year, but there is no limit on income from book
royalties.
   MacKay said he found the book ``enjoyable. It gave insights into
the man.'' The company sent its 336 copies to be distributed to
local high school civics classes, he said.
   The book was published for Wright by a Fort Worth friend of the
speaker, William Carlos Moore, who also has done some $600,000
worth of campaign work for Wright over the years. Wright received a
55 percent royalty, or $3.25 for each $5.95 volume sold, totaling
$55,000. Nearly all 20,000 copies printed have been sold.
   The ethics panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct, also is looking into the propriety of Wright's
use of a congressional staff member to compile and edit the book
and Wright's use of tax money to pay the aide's expenses for a
three-week final editing trip to Fort Worth in late 1984.
   Craig Raupe, a former Wright aide who now lobbies Congress for a
long list of private businesses, also bought numerous copies, the
speaker said. Raupe said he bought only 10 and gave them away to
family members.
   But Raupe also said he arranged for the copies to be purchased
by The New England life insurance company. ``I'm not saying he's a
great author or anything, but I'd do this for him whether I was on
staff or not,'' Raupe said.
   Lobbying records show Raupe represents The New England life
insurance company, along with a number of energy and transportation
companies.
   Another bulk purchaser was a Wright constituent, Clarence Swor,
who owns a sand and gravel company near Forth Worth. Dorothy
Harkness, an longtime employee of Swor, said he was hard of hearing
and could not come to the telephone. But she acknowledged her boss
had bought 200 copies and sent them to relatives.
   She said Swor had known Wright since the speaker was mayor of
Weatherford, Texas, in the 1950s and felt gratitude since Wright
once stopped and gave him a ride when his cattle truck was broken
down. ``They have been friends ever since,'' she said.
   Charlene Bice, a third-grade teacher in Forth Worth who is on
the board of directors of the National Education Association, sold
about 250 copies to other teachers for placement in school
libraries around the state, she said. Bice is a longtime campaign
worker for Wright.
   Wright also said Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., bought 150 copies of
the book. An aide to Gordon, Harrison Wadsworth, said the books
were bought with Gordon's campaign funds and given to contributors
at an Aug. 3, 1985 fundraiser in Tennessee where Wright spoke.
   The speaker also mentioned several purchasers whose names had
been previously reported, including S. Gene Payte, a Fort Worth
developer who bought 1,000 copies of the book to funnel money to
Wright.
   ``I was just trying to make a contribution to Jim's income,''
Payte told The New York Times. ``And I couldn't give him any money.
There are rules against that. So I bought his book.''
   Others who bought 1,000 copies each included the Teamsters
union; former Democratic National Committee chairman John C. White;
Bernard Rapoport, chairman of the American Income Life insurance
company in Waco, Texas; and Leslie A. Berkowitz, who was a lobbyist
for a Texas gas pipeline company.
   Meanwhile, it appeared that Wright's next publishing venture may
be a casualty of the current controversy. Wright has indicated that
he no longer has time to devote to collaborating with aide George
Mair on a book about speakers of the House through its first 200
years.
   Mair acknowledged Tuesday that ``we may be overcome by events.
It's just a casualty of circumstances.''

<HEAD>Columnist Who Shot Teen Says He Still Opposes Handguns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan says he
still strongly opposes handguns, even though he used one to shoot a
teen-ager who had taken an uninvited dip in his backyard swimming
pool.
   ``I am absolutely for gun control. I still am,'' said Rowan.
``But as long as we have a situation where druggies can get guns
easily, you have to protect yourself.''
   Rowan shot the 18-year-old youth in the wrist early Tuesday
morning at his home in an affluent section of the city. He said he
fired only after the young man lunged at him.
   The youth, Ben Smith of Chevy Chase, Md., disputed Rowan's
account, saying he was trying to flee when Rowan shot him. ``That's
no reason to shoot a person _ for swimming in his pool,'' Smith
said.
   Smith and a companion were initially charged with unlawful
entry, but those charges were dropped later on Tuesday.
   Police said the .22 caliber pistol Rowan used was not registered
with the city, which has some of the toughest gun-control laws in
the nation. Rowan said, however, that it was registered with the
federal government.
   The District of Columbia passed a law in 1976 saying that only
guns already then registered were legal for private possession.
Police said their investigation was continuing.
   Rowan said he was awakened at about 1:55 a.m. by the sound of
someone outside his bedroom window.
   ``I lay there thinking, `Did I dream that?' Then I heard a woman
scream or shout,'' he said.
   He said he peeked out, saw four people at his pool and called
the police.
   ``After I called the police, I got the gun,'' said Rowan.
   He said the weapon was given to him by his son, Carl T. Rowan
Jr., an attorney and former FBI agent, after he had received
several threats.
   ``When I saw the police cars arriving, I opened the pool door
assuming the police would want to come in that way.
   ``I was confronted by a tall, young man striding over as if
coming into my house.
   ``First I said, `Freeze.' Then I said, `I warn you, I have a
gun.'''
   ``He said, `Aw hell, man', and kept coming.''
   ``That kid was at point blank range as he tried to come into my
house. I was trying to let him know he was walking into peril. I
was shooting at his feet, but he was lunging at me.''
   Smith, who was treated at Georgetown University Hospital and
released in good condition, told local radio station WMAL that he
was on Rowan's property, but didn't threaten him.
   ``He had no right to shoot me. I mean I guess I was trespassing.
That's no reason to shoot a person _ for swimming in his pool,''
Smith said.
   Smith said he was trying to flee when he was confronted by Rowan.
   Smith and a companion, Laura Bachman, 19, of Bethesda, Md., were
charged by police with unlawful entry, but those charges were later
dropped by the U.S. attorney, which prosecutes all crimes in the
District of Columbia. Rowan said the others he saw at the pool got
away.
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, who asked not to be
identified, said the investigation of the case continued, as did
D.C. police spokesman Capt. William White.
   Rowan said the gun, which police confiscated, was purchased by
his son when he was with the FBI and is registered with the federal
government.
   ``When he left the FBI he went to the district authorities to
see if it had to be registered with the district,'' said Rowan.
``They said it didn't need to be.
   ``He left the gun in my house to protect the family during a
period a few years ago when we were receiving threats,'' Rowan
said. ``Last night was the first time I ever fired that weapon.''
   Rowan was criticized as hypocritical by Wayne LaPierre,
legislative coordinator for the National Rifle Association.
   ``He's another example of someone who is out front for taking
firearms away from other people, but when they make the decision
for themselves, they choose to own one,'' said LaPierre.

<HEAD>House: Election Year Not the Time for Congressional Pay Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House took a look toward the fall election
and decided now is not the time to give itself a pay raise, but it
left intact plans to boost salaries for federal civilian employees.
   By a vote of 230-170, the lawmakers on Tuesday stripped from a
government spending bill a proposed 4 percent hike in pay for
themselves and other top government officials. They left in place
the boost in salaries for other federal workers.
   The House then voted 301-96 for the overall bill, a $16.1
billion spending package for the Treasury, Postal Service, the
Executive Office of the President and other federal agencies. The
measure now goes to the Senate.
   Members of Congress now make $89,500 and the bill would have let
that automatically increase by 4 percent next January along with
the rest of the federal work force.
   Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., offered the amendment to block the
raises for lawmakers, Supreme Court justices, Cabinet officers and
other federal officials at the top of the pay scale.
   Crane said Congress didn't deserve more pay, especially given
its dismal record in reducing federal deficits.
   ``I think ... based upon performance we should not be
contemplating such pay raises'' just a little over a year since
Congress' last boost, he said. He suggested that lawmakers consider
putting themselves on a ``commission basis'' as an incentive to
reduce federal red ink, although that was not part of his
legislative proposal.
   Several members defended the increases as needed to attract top
people to government.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said he'd want the voters to throw him
out of office if they didn't think he deserved the same pay
increase as other federal employees.
   ``It's image. It's political posturing,'' Hoyer said of the
amendment.
   The pay raise issue dominated Tuesday's debate, but the
president's Office of Management and Budget said other problems
with the bill were the ones likely to provoke a veto.
   OMB said the House was failing to provide money to cover the pay
boosts, twice what the president recommended, for the bulk of the
federal work force. The agency said Congress should have cut
spending to offset the increases, instead of waiting for additional
federal spending later.
   The bill also contains $417 million in postal subsidies opposed
by the White House, and some federal construction projects for
which OMB said Congress had not properly accounted for the cost.
   Across the Capitol, the Senate voted 78-18 to approve a $1.8
billion bill covering congressional operations in the coming fiscal
year.
   The measure, a $22 million increase over this year's spending,
covers the current salaries and expenses of lawmakers and
congressional employees, and the costs of upkeep and protection for
the buildings where they work.
   The Senate did not address the issue of pay raises for members
of Congress and other top government officials in this measure.
   The House passed a similar version of that bill last month. A
few minor differences will have to be worked out by negotiators
from the two chambers before the bill can be sent to the president.

   In choosing Kenneth M. Duberstein as his new
White House chief of staff, President Reagan has turned to a
skilled parliamentary veteran in the tradition of retiring chief
Howard H. Baker Jr.
   Otherwise, the two men could hardly be more different.
   Duberstein, 44, is a peppery Brooklyn native with a gift for gab
who was lobbying for the General Services Administration while
Baker was building his reputation in the Senate as a Watergate
interrogator.
   Baker, 62, is a slow spoken Tennessean with a gift for
compromise, widely credited with regrouping the White House staff
after the Iran-Contra debacle but also criticized as too easygoing
in the hot seat he inherited from Donald Regan.
   Reagan announced Tuesday that Baker is resigning for personal
reasons, effective July 1, and that Duberstein, his deputy, will
succeed him.
   ``Duberstein's biggest problem is going to be that he doesn't
have a Duberstein,'' said Tom Korologos, a Washington lobbyist with
strong administration ties.
   ``Ken was the tactician, the strategist, the hands-on mover and
shaker and Baker thought deep thoughts,'' said Korologos.
   Another source, a Reagan administration veteran who spoke on
condition he not be identified, said Duberstein ``has a lot of
energy; there will be a lot of hard charging.''
   Howard Liebengood, a longtime Baker aide in the Senate, said,
``You've got to consider that this is Howard Baker's first
experience being a staff person. He was always the principal, as
senator from Tennessee and as minority and majority leader.''
   Duberstein, on the other hand, has been a staff person most of
his life.
   He started out in 1965, fresh out of Franklin & Marshall College
in Lancaster, Pa., as an intern for Sen. Jacob Javits, R-N.Y. He
left Javits' staff as a research assistant in 1967 and returned to
his alma mater for five years as assistant to the president.
   From 1972 to 1976 he was director of congressional and
intergovernmental affairs for the GSA, the landlord agency for the
federal government.
   Duberstein also served as deputy undersecretary of labor,
responsible for legislative and intergovernmental activities, in
the Ford administration.
   During the White House term of Democrat Jimmy Carter, he served
for four years as vice president and director of
business-government relations for the Committee for Economic
Development, an organization of business and university leaders.
   He joined the Reagan administration at the outset in January
1981 as chief lobbyist at the House of Representatives. He was
later promoted to head of the legislative affairs office.
   In December 1983, he left the administration to join the
Washington-based business consulting firm of Timmons and Co. as
vice president. He came back to the White House in March 1987 as
Baker's deputy.
   ``Ken will be my principal aide and will lead the White House
staff as we head into the home stretch,'' said Reagan.
   He will be Reagan's fourth chief of staff. The first was James
A. Baker III, who became treasury secretary early in 1985 by
trading jobs with Regan, Baker's predecessor.
   Duberstein is married to the former Sydney Greenberg and has
three children: Jennifer, 13; Jeffrey, 3; and Andrew, 1.

   As if it weren't enough that lightning has
been known to strike twice in the same place, now scientists have
found two snowflakes that were alike.
   The matching snow crystals were discovered during cloud research
by Nancy C. Knight of the National Center for Atmospheric Research
in Boulder, Colo.
   ``One of the most quoted statements about snow crystals is that
no two are alike, a bit of folk wisdom that is generally accepted
even among those few regarded as experts in the subject,'' Mrs.
Knight wrote in a letter appearing in the just published May
edition of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
   But, she went on, she has found ``a striking example of two snow
crystals which, if not identical, are certainly very much alike.''
   ``In many years of snow-crystal collection the author has seen
no other examples of such crystals nor are any given in the
standard references,'' she wrote.
   ``My first reaction was to say, `that's absolutely
impossible,''' said her husband, Charles Knight, also a researcher
at the center.
   But there the two crystals were, side by side, on a slide
exposed in a cloud on a research flight over Wausau, Wis.
   ``When you say no two are identical, that's a sort of
philosophical question; there have been an awful lot of snow
crystals over the history of the Earth,'' said Knight, whose wife
is out of the country doing research.
   ``Especially with small ones it is likely many were similar to
one another. But these two are a paradox,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Meteorologists prefer the term snow crystals to snowflakes,
because the structures take many forms other than the commonly
pictured six-pointed star. Snow crystals also can be shaped like
columns, needles, plates and just plain lumps.
   The crystals photographed by Mrs. Knight are shaped like columns
with vase-shaped hollow centers. They are very tiny, only
one-quarter millimeter (0.009 inch) the long way, slightly less on
the short side.
   Column-shaped snow is not really unusual, Knight said. ``When
you go out and see real snow crystals you begin to appreciate that
those beautiful crystals in (picture books) are really quite rare.''
   Because crystals tend to grow fastest at their edges,
column-shaped crystals with hollows in the middle _ called lacunas
_ are not unusual.
   The two ``virtually identical'' crystals were collected on Nov.
1, 1986, said Knight. The researchers were studying clouds at the
time.
   The crystals were collected on a glass plate coated with oil,
which was exposed to the cloud for 11 seconds at an altitude of
nearly 20,000 feet. The plate was then kept cold until the airplane
could return to the ground and the snow crystals were photographed.
   The crystals in question ``don't exist any more,'' Knight noted.
   In order to develop such identical shapes the two ``had to go
through identical growth histories,'' accumulating freezing water
as they passed through layers of cold air, he said.
   Research in cirrus clouds like those where the matching crystals
were found has become increasingly popular in recent years, so more
matched pairs could turn up, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Insists on Separate Iran-Contra Trials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case
is sticking with his decision to hold separate trials for former
White House aide Oliver L. North and three co-defendants.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Tuesday rejected
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's suggestion that he try
North and former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
together before two juries.
   Walsh's proposal for a dual-jury trial, followed by another for
arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
V. Secord, was made last week after Gesell ordered four separate
trials.
   The prosecutor, who suffered a tactical and logistical blow by
the judge's ruling, contended that four separate trials would
inconvenience both the prosecution and the defense.
   Gesell ruled that each of the four men accused of conspiring to
divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels must be
tried separately to allow them to use each other's immunized
congressional testimony as evidence.
   A joint trial would be impossible, Gesell ruled, because a
defendant's right not to have his congressional testimony used
against him would conflict with a co-defendant's right to use all
available evidence to help his defense.
   The judge has not ruled definitively on whether the
congressional immunity given North, Poindexter and Hakim would
prevent the cases from going forward.
   But Gesell gave further indication Tuesday that he planned to
proceed with a trial of North, whom Walsh has designated as the
lead-off defendant.
   In a memorandum issued to explain why he canceled Monday's
hearing to take testimony on the issue, Gesell said he wanted ``to
defer this aspect for post-trial ... consideration, at which time
counsel will be guided by the court's forthcoming ... opinion.''
   The defense contends that the prosecution was tainted by
exposure to the testimony the three men gave under grants of
limited immunity from prosecution.
   Gesell has indicated he will rule on pending pre-trial motions
by July 1 to enable him to set a prompt trial date.
   The judge rejected as too cumbersome Walsh's proposal for
two-jury trials. Under Walsh's plan, the jury considering the
evidence against Poindexter, for example, would have left the
courtroom when North's lawyers cited the former national security
adviser's congressional testimony.
   ``Quite unlike any prior two-jury trial, the need to exclude one
jury alternating with the other will continually arise with
practically every witness and an orderly trial free of error could
not be achieved,'' Gesell said.
   The judge also indicated that it might be unnecessary for Walsh
to divide his staff into three trial teams to prevent his
prosecutors from being tainted by exposure to congressional
testimony cited during the trials.
   ``Counsel for all parties are advised that once the government
is exposed to the immunized testimony during a trial of one
defendant, the court is presently aware of no decision that would
foreclose the same prosecuting attorneys handling the first trial
from full participation in subsequent trials,'' the judge said.
``But resolution of this issue must await further developments.''

<HEAD>Product Liability Bill Faces Uphill Battle In House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business and consumer interests are moving to
a new House battleground in their high-stakes war over revamping
the nation's product liability laws, with little likelihood that
either side can claim victory in Congress this year.
   A complex, politically explosive bill that would impose uniform
federal liability standards for lawsuits over defective consumer
goods cleared the House Energy and Commerce Committee by a 30-12
vote Tuesday.
   It was the first time a product liability bill had ever been
approved by a House committee, but the measure is given little
chance of passing Congress until next year at the earliest.
   The bill, which is vigorously opposed by consumer groups, is now
headed for further scrutiny by the House Judiciary Committee, which
shares jurisdiction. That panel traditionally has supported trial
lawyers _ many of whom specialize in filing damage suits _ in their
opposition to such legislation.
   Even if the measure eventually manages to win House floor
passage, it faces a daunting challenge in the Senate. A similar
bill died on the Senate floor in late 1986 after Ernest B.
Hollings, D-S.C., himself a former trial lawyer, led a filibuster
against the measure.
   The bipartisan compromise approved Tuesday would limit the legal
grounds available to victims seeking damages from manufacturers of
hazardous products. The bill would pre-empt a wide variety of state
liability laws that both sides say are much more favorable to
plaintiffs in damage suits.
   Alexander B. Trowbridge, president of the National Manufacturers
Association, said the bill would ``help curb the number of
unwarranted lawsuits,'' stimulate the economy and reduce consumer
prices.
   The NAM executive said the measure would ``go a long way toward
bringing America's lawsuit crisis under control.''
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader countered that the liability
insurance ``crisis'' of the 1980s was created by the ``insurers'
own mismanagement and possible illegal anti-consumer tactics.''
   Nader accused the Energy and Commerce Committee of siding with
``toxic chemical producers, dangerously defective product
manufacturers and other promoters of corporate violence.''
   Four consumer groups, including the Consumer Federation of
America, charged that the bill would reduce manufacturers'
liability for producing and selling defective products and would
restrict the legal rights of their victims.
   The committee's 25 Democrats were almost evenly split over the
measure, which was unanimously backed by the panel's 17 Republicans.
   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., a key figure in negotiations for a
compromise, said he voted against the bill because of what he
called special-interest amendments that ``tip the scales unfairly
against the consumer.''
   The major feature opposed by consumer lobbyists was the ``state
of the art'' defense available to manufacturers under the bill.
   That defense states that manufacturers can escape liability if
they can prove they did not know _ or could not have known _ of a
design defect with knowledge ``reasonably available to experts,''
or if there were no feasible alternative design.
   Under a pro-consumer compromise crafted by Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., plaintiffs could overcome the state-of-the-art defense if
they prove that a product was so unsafe compared with its
usefulness that it should not have been marketed.
   Critics say a federal standard allowing a state-of-the-art
defense, currently available to manufacturers in only eight states,
would undermine the legal doctrine of ``strict liability'' used in
47 states and favored by consumer interests.
   That doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the
manufacturer's alleged misconduct to the defective product itself,
relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or
should have known about a product's defects.

<HEAD>Senate Agrees To Add Statue Of Army Nurse To Memorial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 10,000 American women who took part in
America's longest war will be commemorated by an additional statue
at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial if the House goes along with the
Senate as expected.
   The Senate approved the new statue Tuesday on a 96-1 vote,
sending the bill to the House. A House subcommittee will hold a
hearing on the bill next Tuesday.
   The memorial itself was built with $11 million in private
donations and quickly became one of the capital's most popular
monuments after it opened in 1982. It has attracted an estimated 30
million visitors.
   Located on 2.2 acres near the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam
memorial's walls list the names of the more than 58,000 Americans,
including eight uniformed Army nurses, who died or are missing from
the war.
   But the black granite design was also the subject of
controversy, with critics saying a more traditional memorial should
have been erected.
   In 1984, two years after the memorial opened, a large American
flag and a statue of three infantrymen were added to a spot near
one end of the memorial's chevron-shaped wall.
   About the same time, a push began to add a statue honoring women
who served in Vietnam.
   The measure approved Tuesday calls for a bronze statue of an
Army nurse.
   Sponsored by Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., the bill had 75
co-sponsors and was endorsed by the Interior Department.
   Durenberger said the statue would be ``an appropriate and long
overdue symbol of this nation's gratitude for the sacrifices and
contributions of the 10,000 women who served in Vietnam.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., agreed, calling the statue an
``altogether appropriate'' way to honor the women who took part in
the Vietnam war.
   The lone opposition vote was cast by Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash.,
who also opposed the measure last month when it was approved by the
Energy and Natural Resources Commission.
   Evans did not speak Tuesday, but he made clear last month that
his opposition is based on a belief that another statue would
destroy the artistic integrity of the Vietnam Memorial.
   The Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capitol Planning
Commission also opposed the female statute, arguing that the
Vietnam Memorial was already complete.
   Another opponent was Maya Lin, the architect who designed the
original memorial.
   Durenberger said he wants to halt the addition of more statutes
to the Vietnam monument. The bill includes a provision noting that
``after the addition of the statue, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
will be complete and no other additions to the site will be
authorized or undertaken.''

<HEAD>Soviets Saying Nyet To Grain For Vodka, Da For Livestock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Cattle, pigs and chickens in the Soviet Union
have a record amount of grain to eat, but vodka makers are going to
have to keep on skimping, says an Agriculture Department analyst.
   ``Domestic use of grain for feed is estimated at a record 132
million (metric) tons, reflecting the continued Soviet policy of
boosting livestock production,'' according to Christian J. Foster
of the department's Economic Research Service.
   The latest USDA estimates show Soviet total grain production
this year at 215 million tons, up from 211.4 million tons in 1987
and 210.1 million tons in 1986 _ an unprecedented string of bumper
harvests for the Soviet Union.
   By far the largest use of grain in the Soviet Union _ as it is
in the United States _ is for livestock feed.
   The 132 million tons of grain expected to be used as feed in
1988-89 compares with 47 million tons for human food, 25 million
tons for seed, and only 5 million tons for industrial purposes,
which includes the manufacture of vodka. Also, an estimated 25
million tons will be lost to spoilage and other post-harvest causes.
   Industrial use of Soviet grain peaked at around 6 million tons
in the late 1970s and again as recently as 1984.
   Foster said Soviet industrial use of grain ``remains below the
1984 peak because of decreased vodka production'' as part of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's anti-alcoholism campaign.
   ``Soviet production of vodka in 1987 declined for the third
consecutive year, down 16 percent from 1986 and 58 percent from
1980,'' Foster said in the June issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine. ``Both wheat and rye are used in making vodka. Barley is
used in beer.''
   But Foster added that as the Soviet Union's official state
production of alcoholic beverages has dropped, illegal distilleries
have proliferated.
   ``In 1987, more than 500,000 people were fined or arrested for
the illegal production of alcohol,'' he said. ``The number of fines
and arrests is up 13 times from 1984.''
   Foster added: ``Because of public tensions over the reduction in
vodka for sale, Soviet authorities have decided to increase alcohol
production _ mainly beer, wine and brandy _ in 1988.''

   The government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility says dry conditions have forced wheat and some other grain
crops to mature rapidly in most of the eastern half of the country.
   Moreover, the lack of soil moisture hampered seed germination
and growth of corn and other row crops during the week of June
6-12, the facility said Tuesday in its weekly report.
   ``Hot temperatures in the early part of the week depleted soil
moisture and caused plants to begin wilting in some areas,'' the
report said.
   Overall, winter wheat was 93 percent headed, 5 percentage points
ahead of the 5-year average for this time of the season. Harvest,
which has begun in the Delta and Southeast areas, was estimated to
be 9 percent completed, slightly ahead of normal.
   The facility, which is operated jointly by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments, reports on weather and general conditions of
crops but makes no production estimates.
   ``Spring wheat was mostly fair to poor in the northern Great
Plains,'' the report said. ``Soybeans were 90 percent seeded, 15
points above the previous week and 10 percent above average.
Dryness hampered germination and growth. Plants began wilting in
some Corn Belt states.''
   Corn planted for this year's harvest was in ``mostly fair to
good'' condition by June 12 ``but varied by areas, depending on
available moisture,'' the report said.

   A sharply expanded acreage of U.S. rice may
lead the way for a general increase in world rice production this
year, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   If indicated plantings are borne out and yields are in line with
past trends, U.S. rice production could be around 157 million
hundredweight this year, up 23 percent from 1987, the department's
Economic Research Service said Tuesday.
   Assuming a return to normal weather in Asia, foreign production
could rise 7 percent in 1988-89, the agency said. In that case,
global rice consumption would be expected to increase substantially
following last year's decline, the first since 1971-72.
   ``Global trade probably will rise in 1988-89 as exportable
supplies become more plentiful,'' the report said. ``While the
United States stands to benefit from the growth in consumption and
trade, competition for world markets in 1989 may intensify.''

<HEAD>Cautious Response From Regulators Praised By Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial regulators from the Reagan
administration are finally hearing kind words for their go-slow
response to the October stock market crash after enduring two
grueling sessions before critical lawmakers.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
on Tuesday praised the members of an administration working group
on stock market reform for their ``political courage'' in
recommending, for the most part, preservation of the status quo.
   The regulators, led by Treasury Undersecretary George D. Gould,
offer few dramatic changes in federal oversight of the nation's
stock, futures and options markets. And, they reject calls from
some members of Congress for more unified regulation of the markets.
   The group _ which includes the heads of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission _ issued their report on May 16. In two
hearings immediately following the release _ one in the House and
one in the Senate, few in Congress had anything good to say about
it.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., who
wants a committee headed by the Fed chairman to coordinate
intermarket issues, denounced the panel's findings as ``pitiful.''
   House finance subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey, D-Mass., who
would transfer jurisdiction over stock index futures from the CFTC
to the SEC, said the administration took a ``horse and buggy
approach'' to regulatory reform.
   Markey's panel oversees the SEC, while Proxmire's committee has
jurisdiction over both the Fed and the SEC.
   However, members of both the House and Senate agriculture
committees, which oversee the CFTC, have staunchly defended that
agency's autonomy. When the CFTC's jurisdiction was expanded in
1982 to include stock index futures as well as traditional futures
contracts for commodities like oil and pork bellies, the
agriculture committees' jurisdictions were expanded as well.
   De la Garza characterized previous debate over market crash as
an exercise in ``fingerpointing'' and ``turf battles,'' and said,
``We want to make sure neither we nor any other congressional
committee is trying to fix something that isn't broken.
   ``I commend the members of the working group for having the
political courage to tell those who would legislate for
legislation's sake that such a course of action would be both
unnecessary and unwise,'' he said.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, who has dissented from some of the
administration group's stands, came under sharp questioning from
several committee members.
   Unlike the other regulators, Ruder would expand his own agency's
authority to cover stock index futures. He also would temporarily
raise margins on futures contracts to dampen the wide price swings
that have characterized the market in recent months.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., said CFTC regulation of futures
during the crash generated far fewer complaints than SEC regulation
of the options markets. He told Ruder ``maybe you ought to take a
look at your own shop'' before seeking wider power.
   Ruder replied that English was ``comparing apples with
oranges.'' Contracts are traded on only about 20 stock indexes,
while there are hundreds of options traded on individual stocks, he
said.

   Progress on a Senate welfare bill designed to
alter radically the way the nation helps its poor stalled behind
closed doors as the Reagan administration sought to mold the
measure to its liking.
   Senators and staff aides met with White House representatives
throughout the day Tuesday, trying to avert a veto fight at the end
of an arduous journey toward a welfare system oriented more toward
work than income maintenance.
   A compromise was on the table at the end of the day, but there
was no indication of whether the administration was going to go
along.
   ``It's not very clear what will satisfy the administration, and
that makes it very difficult,'' Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said at
one point in the negotiations.
   Senators were prepared for a floor fight if the negotiations
failed.
   ``We're either going to wind it up ... or go out there and start
battling it out,'' said Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   The five-year, $2.6 billion Family Security Act would require
states to set up broad new education, training and employment
programs. They would have to enroll as many welfare parents as they
could afford, concentrating at least half their resources on those
who are or are likely to be long-term recipients.
   Building on the theme of parental responsibility, the bill also
requires extensive state efforts to determine paternity and
automatic wage withholding immediately upon the awarding of child
support.
   The administration was trying to win greater state latitude in
experimenting with innovative welfare plans and a guarantee that a
certain percentage of welfare recipients would participate in the
new jobs and education program.
   The bill, written by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., is
sponsored by 64 of the 100 senators and, according to an aide, at
least two others support it.
   Before going to the White House, the Senate bill will have to be
reconciled with a similar but much more expensive House bill passed
last December. It is unclear whether either the Senate or the House
could muster the two-thirds majority needed to override a
presidential veto.
   Moynihan said Tuesday that the administration had dropped its
opposition to a new requirement that states make welfare benefits
available to poor two-parent families for at least six months in a
year. Twenty-six states already provide year-round coverage.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said senators were discussing a
mandatory 10 percent or 15 percent participation rate for welfare
recipients in the jobs and education program, rising eventually to
25 percent. The administration wanted to go higher than that, he
said.
   The nation's governors oppose mandatory participation rates
because they say that would force them to focus on people who are
easy to help and provide services that are less than comprehensive
_ totally contrary to the bill's purported focus on those apt to
become long-term welfare clients.
   Moynihan said the governors had told him, ``Don't make us get
into faking the statistics. We want to get into the hard cases.''

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Tax Legislation May Be Limited To Technical
Corrections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress seldom lets a year pass without
writing a tax bill, and this year apparently will be no different.
But budget restraints are likely to reduce the number of new tax
breaks considerably.
   However, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, says any tax bill that passes this year
is sure to include special relief for farmers from the federal tax
on diesel fuel.
   Despite a need to correct some mainly technical errors in the
big 1986 tax overhaul, there is no certainty that any tax measure
will pass this year. But Rostenkowski said he feels better about
the prospects after separate meetings Tuesday with Democrats and
Republicans on his committee.
   ``I'm encouraged that they want to write a technical-corrections
bill,'' Rostenkowski told reporters. ``We have a responsibility to
write a technical-corrections bill.''
   He said he expects the committee to start work on a bill next
week under rules requiring, because of budget constraints, that any
amendment offering tax relief to a specific group be paid for in
the same legislation by raising taxes on someone else.
   The only tax break that Rostenkowski said is sure to be in the
bill would relieve farmers from a requirement that they pay the
federal tax on diesel fuel used for off-the-road purposes and then
apply to the government at the end of the year for a rebate. More
than half the members of the House have signed a bill to wipe out
that requirement.
   The Senate Finance Committee has voted to extend the repeal to
state and local governments as well.
   The technical-corrections bill _ and whatever amendments the
House and Senate agreed to attach to it _ likely would be the only
tax legislation that has a chance of passing Congress this year.
   The tight budget and an agreement between the White House and
Congress on reducing the deficit are apt to reduce sharply the
number of amendments that are tacked onto the bill.
   Rostenkowski said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
Finance Committee, is ``encouraged that he can hold a very
well-disciplined bill together on the floor of the Senate'' _ that
is, that he could protect it against serious amendment.
   Rostenkowski said there is considerable support on his committee
for extending for one or two years some tax breaks that have
expired or are scheduled to end later this year. These include a
tax exemption for revenue bonds that help first-time homebuyers; a
credit for increased research and development; and a tax credit
that encourages employers to hire the poor.
   Any tax bill is likely to face amendment by lawmakers who want
to reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the sale
of stocks, land and other assets.
   This issue is complicated by the fact that advocates of a
reduction _ including Vice President George Bush _ contend such a
move would increase tax collections by encouraging investment.
Opponents deny it.
   Another hot issue is a ``taxpayer bill of rights,'' aimed at
curbing alleged excesses of the Internal Revenue Service. The
Finance Committee has approved a version, but Ways and Means
members have been cool to the idea.
   Efforts likely will be made to enact some kind of tax incentive
to encourage parents to save for educating their children.
   And there is considerable support for making permanent a 1987
change that relieved mutual fund shareholders from a tax on
``phantom income,'' a portion of operating expenses passed along to
shareholders as income.
   Rostenkowski said he would be happy to settle for about $2
billion worth of new tax relief in the package, the same figure
that Reagan administration officials have mentioned. But he
acknowledged he and the administration probably would not agree on
what the $2 billion would be spent for.
   He said he and his staff will draw up a list of suggestions for
raising the revenue needed to pay for any new tax relief. That list
almost certainly would include a new tax on single-premium
life-insurance policies, under which generally upper-income
investors buy large policies against which they may borrow tax-free.

   When Howard Henry Baker Jr. moved into his job
as White House chief of staff there was a tendency in the capital
to think _ perhaps even yearn _ that he would become acting
president.
   Iran-Contra had Ronald Reagan on the ropes, his hands-off style
discredited and a hostile Congress eager to open a Watergate-style
investigation of the scandal.
   In addition, the president's extraordinary talent as a
communicator was under challenge from a new Soviet leader who
appeared capable of stealing scenes from Reagan.
   Washington insiders were looking for one of their own to take
charge and rescue the administration, if not the country.
   And what could be more comforting in those troubled times than
to have Baker move into the White House. After all the former
Tennessee senator was widely regarded as qualified to be president,
even though temperamentally ill-suited to the rigors of winning the
job.
   Just as Baker's presidential ambitions never lived up to
expectations, his tour as chief of staff also was open to mixed
reviews as he prepared to leave at the end of the month.
   Baker himself summed it up as he prepared to assume the post:
``I am acutely aware of the fact that Ronald Reagan is the
president and I am not.''
   And after the judicial confirmation disasters of Robert H. Bork
and Douglas Ginsburg and the protracted negotiations with
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, Baker must now appreciate
how right he was.
   Things continued going wrong and Baker often found himself
trying to explain why.
   It often falls to top White House aides to explain why things
went wrong. The president gets to explain the things that went
right, like arms control agreements and Moscow summits.
   When Baker accepted the White House post in the spring of 1987,
he gave up what was looking like another disastrous bid for the
presidency, an effort in which the candidate always seemed to be
talking about how it was too early for serious campaigning. Too
early for him while his rivals were spending every spare moment in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
   In 1980, Baker was the Senate Republican leader and Washington
insiders considered him a strong contender for the GOP presidential
nomination to challenge Democrat Jimmy Carter.
   Ronald Reagan, the former governor of California was surely too
old and too conservative, and who else was there? George Bush had
become practically a resident of Iowa, but who'd ever heard of the
former two-term congressman from Texas?
   Baker was the favorite of party moderates, the senator who had
helped win ratification of the Panama Canal treaties.
   It became clear that something was wrong when Maine Republicans
held a straw poll at their state convention and Baker was sure that
his ally, Sen. William Cohen of Maine, would deliver a victory for
him.
   While Baker depended on Cohen, Bush worked on individual
delegates and pulled off an upset that was the first signal that
the Baker bandwagon was never going to get rolling.
   Now, many of the GOP moderates who thought Baker would make a
fine president are touting him as an ideal running mate for George
Bush in the 1988 presidential election.
   Bush, asked by reporters Tuesday whether he would consider Baker
as a possible running mate, responded: ``No talk about a vice
president. It's too early.''
   The odds that Bush would turn to Baker are long at best.
   To begin with, conservatives still remember Baker's role in
winning approval of the Panama Canal treaties, they so fervently
opposed. And while Bush doesn't need to bow to every conservative
demand, he doesn't want to alienate that wing of his party either.
   Geographically, Baker also is wrong. His base is the South, a
region where Bush also is strong.
   But the biggest argument against Baker is the job he has held
the past 14 months.
   One of Bush's most obvious tasks as a presidential candidate is
to show what he would do as president, where he would take the
country after nearly eight years of Ronald Reagan.
   It is a difficult and often uncomfortable task for Bush. He
prizes loyalty to the president and has only reluctantly expressed
differences with administration policy.
   That task would become that much more difficult if his running
mate were out on the stump being asked if he agreed or disagreed
with this or that policy during his tenure as Reagan's top White
House aide.

<HEAD>Dukakis Continues Assault On Administration Drug Efforts</HEAD>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, denouncing President
Reagan for allowing Coast Guard cuts, continued his tough talk on
drugs while his campaign stepped up the search for a running mate.
   The Massachusetts governor visited the New Bedford waterfront on
Tuesday and denounced Reagan for allowing budget cuts that forced a
55 percent reduction in Coast Guard patrols.
   Dukakis was continuing his focus on drug and crime matters
today. He had meetings set with New York law enforcement officials
and with new state police recruits.
   The governor also planned to meet with his anti-crime council
and announce the latest additions to the state's violent fugitives
list.
   After a meeting with leaders of a local drug task force aboard
the Coast Guard cutter Vigilant on Tuesday, Dukakis said the
commander told him the vessel would be out of service for at least
three months because of the cuts, part of a budget-cutting
compromise between Reagan and Congress.
   ``If this ship is tied up here for the next three or four
months, that's not waging a war,'' he said. ``How can we talk about
waging a war?''
   Dukakis said if elected, he would restore the Coast Guard
funding.
   ``Of course Congress shares the responsibility,'' he said when
asked about the compromise agreement. ``But the leadership has to
come from the White House.''
   He called Coast Guard patrols the nation's ``first line of
defense'' in the drug war.
   ``We need them. The nation needs them, and this boat is going to
be tied up here the next three months,'' Dukakis said. ``That just
doesn't make any sense.''
   Dukakis was at the southeastern Massachusetts port to salute
about 100 police officers who completed a training program for
street-level drug investigations.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' campaign chairman, Paul Brountas, remained
in Washington to continue the search for a running mate.
   Campaign and Capitol Hill aides said Brountas would spend the
next few days in Washington consulting with party leaders and
others, including two senators often mentioned as potential running
mates _ John Glenn of Ohio and Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
   Brountas has said he will consult with Dukakis after the
meetings to trim the list of potentials and have background checks
conducted on the remaining candidates.
   Dukakis will begin a three-day campaign swing through the South
on Thursday. During that trip he expects to pick up the endorsement
of former rival Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, also considered by
some as a potential Dukakis running mate.

<HEAD>Bush Unveils `National Merit School' Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, laying a
cornerstone of his plan to be ``the education president,'' is
proposing a $500 million recognition program with $100,000 awards
for schools that improve the performance of disdvantaged students.
   He unveiled his ``National Merit School'' idea Tuesday at a
luncheon honoring 139 high school seniors who are the 1988
Presidential Scholars.
   Saying ``our schools are absolutely not as good as they must
be,'' Bush said he would stress policies that reward excellence and
better performance.
   The likely Republican nominee also called for awarding states $1
million each for ``experimentation and innovation'' in areas such
as merit pay for teachers and year-round schools.
   ``Our program for the future must be built around a strategy of
investing in our children,'' Bush said.
   The federal government pays only 7 percent of local public
school costs, and that isn't going to change, said Bush.
   ``When it comes to better schools, almost all of the wisdom and
the good answers and the money to pay the bills should come from
outside Washington, D.C.,'' he said.
   But then Bush, who has been accused by Michael Dukakis and
others of offering little to back up his oft-repeated intention of
being ``the education president,'' took the wraps off his
``National Merit School'' idea.
   It would honor schools that ``significantly improve their
performance'' on test scores, dropout rates or other measures
selected by each state, and it would shower cash awards on the top
20 percent of schools with ``a significant proportion of
disadvantaged students,'' the vice president said.
   The awards would be based on school size and would average
$100,000 for up to 5,000 schools.
   ``Each winning school could use the money as it pleased _ for
lab equipment, library books, or rewards for teachers and
principals,'' he said.
   The vice president also called for expanding an existing $12
million program to $50 million for financing experiments in
education reform. ``Only by testing these concepts in practice will
we be able to learn which reforms work and which do not,'' he said.
   He also backed a proposal by Education Secretary William Bennett
for giving $50 million to states for matching grants to create or
support magnet schools that feature academic or vocational
specialties.
   Bennett said in a statement: ``The vice president has focused on
the central issues of education reform: accountability, choice,
raising standards and rewarding success. This is a good agenda for
the `education president.'''
   Bush urged the National Education Association, the 1.9
million-member teacher union, to support merit pay for the best
teachers.
   Howard Carroll, an NEA spokesman, replied: ``That's a lot of
baloney. That doesn't work.''
   Of Bush's merit school program, Carroll said the $500 million
would ``set up another bureaucracy. That money could better be
spent on Chapter One or other programs that desperately need it.''
Chapter One is the government's $4 billion program to help pay for
remedial education for the poor.
   Bush said that school reform must put ``an emphasis on
accountability ... changing what doesn't work and rewarding what
does.''
   Bush also reiterated his support for tax-free savings bonds to
help finance college educations.
   Charles W. Greenleaf Jr., Bush's domestic affairs adviser, said
the new proposals outlined on Tuesday are ``by no means all'' of
Bush's educational plans. Additional ones will be detailed this
summer, he said.
   Greenleaf said that the total $600 million pricetag would have
to be offset by savings in other areas under Bush's ``flexible
freeze'' proposal to hold overall federal spending to the rate of
inflation, but no decisions have been made on where those cuts
would be made.

<HEAD>Attorneys General Call For Repeal Of Insurance Antitrust Exemption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The insurance industry is so protected by a
federal antitrust exemption that a few executives are able to
exercise immense control over rates and who should receive
liability insurance, the Texas attorney general told a Senate panel.
   ``The leaders of the property and casualty insurance industry
meet constantly to discuss their profits, their losses and their
objectives for the future,'' Jim Mattox told the Senate antitrust
committee on Tuesday.
   ``They sit aroud the table in the board rooms of ISO (Insurance
Services Office) and they do what no other industry can do - by
meeting together, talking together, planning together, strategizing
together - and I might say, conspiring together,'' he said.
   Mattox and his counterparts in New York and Massachusetts are
urging Congress to strip the insurance industry of its antitrust
exemption.
   Robert Abrams of New York, president-elect of the National
Association of Attorneys General, said Congress ``should repeal the
anomalous and anachronistic McCarran-Ferguson Act, thereby
requiring the insurance industry to operate within the same basic
competitive framework which has served American business and
consumers so well.''
   The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed in 1945, grants the antitrust
exemption. A number of states have filed suit alleging that dozens
of insurance companies conspired under the exemption to create the
liability insurance crisis of 1985-86, which made coverage
unavailable or too costly for many governments and businesses.
   Mattox, Abrams and James A. Shannon of Massachusetts also called
for the replacement of the data-gathering function of Insurance
Services Office (ISO), the primary industry rate and trade advisory
organization, with the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis or another existing federal agency.
   They also recommended the establishment of strong American
reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance markets in an effort to
halt the flow of money overseas where, they said, almost all the
reinsurance companies are located.
   Reinsurance is insurance purchased by insurers to help pay
claims that they in turn must pay. Similarly, retrocessional
coverage is insurance for reinsurers.
   Craig A. Berrington, general counsel of the American Insurance
Association which represents 183 property-casualty companies, said
there is no need to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act because state
insurance agencies have the tools to regulate the industry in their
states.
   He said the lawsuits raise ``important public policy questions
about the role of state regulation of insurance, the true causes of
the liability crisis and the extent of competition in the insurance
business.''

<HEAD>Reagans Stayed Away, But Soviet Family Is Refused Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish family again was refused permission to
emigrate, two weeks after President Reagan canceled a meeting with
them for fear of dooming their 11-year campaign to leave.
   Tanya Zieman, whose 12-year-old daughter had appealed to the
president and Mrs. Reagan for help in leaving the country, said she
received the news Tuesday evening from the Moscow City Council.
   She said the Moscow Soviet, or council, told her the family's
appeal was turned down by a special review commission of the
Supreme Soviet, the nation's nominal parliament, and could reapply
``after 1992.''
   During the Reagans' summit trip to Moscow two weeks ago, U.S.
sources said the American first family agonized over whether to
stop at the Ziemans' home after a top Soviet Foreign Ministry
official warned such a visit would ruin the family's chances to
emigrate.
   The Ziemans' younger daughter, Vera, who calls herself ``a
lifelong refusenik'' because her family applied to emigrate shortly
after she was born, had written the Reagans asking for their help.
   White House officials had been to the Ziemans' tiny, three-room
apartment in southwest Moscow to survey the home for a presidential
visit the week before the Reagans' May 29 arrival in Moscow.
   Soviet authorities, getting wind of the plans, sent a swarm of
workers to repave the drive, paint the apartment building, repair
the stoop, scrub the corridor walls and landscape nearby flower
beds.
   A massive security force deployed around the building the day
the Reagans arrived in the capital drew a crowd of several hundred
local residents.
   But U.S. and Soviet sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh warned U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock and an accompanying White House official
that if the Reagans went through with the visit, the Ziemans would
never leave the country.
   In the end, the Reagans scrubbed the plan.
   ``They didn't want to knuckle under to intimidation, but they
didn't want to hurt the Ziemans, either,'' one source said.
   The family, headed by Yuri Zieman, a former computer specialist,
did attend a tea the Reagans gave for people the U.S.
administration considers victims of Soviet human rights abuses.
   Yuri Zieman, who lost his job when he applied to emigrate in
1977, worked as a plumber until he was stricken several months ago
by a mysterious brain ailment that has left him with double vision
and a loss of balance.
   During his hospitalization for that condition, he contracted
hepatitis, and his wife said Tuesday he remained very weak.
   Zieman has been told he is not permitted to leave the country
for security reasons, although he contends he never had access to
state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet
security.
   ``He had been feeling much better the last two weeks, thinking
we would be getting some good news soon'' following the Moscow
summit, Mrs. Zieman said Tuesday.
   Asked if the family would apply again for exit visas, she said,
``I'm still very much in a fighting mood.''

   NBC offered a slate of reruns and had its
lowest overall rating of the season, but still kept top spot while
the second game of the NBA finals helped boost CBS to the No. 2
position in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   The top-rated shows for the week that ended Sunday were
``Cheers,'' ``A Different World,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' and ``Night
Court,'' all on NBC.
   ``The CBS Sunday Movie _ That Secret Sunday,'' placed fifth. The
rest of the top 10 were ``Golden Girls'' and ``L.A. Law,'' NBC;
``NBA Finals, Game Two,'' and ``60 Minutes,'' a tie for CBS; and
``The Hogan Family'' and ``NBC Monday Night Movies,'' a tie for NBC.
   ``The CBS Evening News'' regained its No. 1 position with a 9.0
rating after being edged out for six weeks by ABC's ``World News
Tonight,'' which finished with an 8.9 rating. ``NBC Nightly News''
was third with an 8.5 rating.
   NBC finished first overall with an average rating for the week
of 15.8, followed by CBS with 13.2 and ABC with 12.5.
   The cumulative rating of 41.5 is a drop from the season average
of 43.1, as longer daylight hours and outside activities lure
viewers out of their living rooms.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions.
   The lowest-rated prime time network shows last week were: ``Tour
of Duty,'' ``ABC Monday Night Baseball,'' ``Houston Knights,'' Days
and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' ``Ohara,'' ``Cronkite at Large,''
``High Mountain Rangers,'' ``Our House,'' ``Disney Sunday Movie,''
and ``Probe.''

   A thousand school children, joined by
professional dancers, senior citizens, New York City cops and
Australian lifeguards, celebrated ``A Day in the Life of Coney
Island'' in a dance recital at the Felt Forum.
   Tuesday's show was the National Dance Institute's annual ``Event
of the Year,'' which gets bigger and more joyful each year.
   Jacques d'Amboise, who founded the institute in 1976 to teach
dancing to schoolboys, wrote this year's story. He also wrote most
of the lyrics and conductor Lee Norris wrote most of the tunes used
for the dances.
   The event is no longer limited to boys _ this year's dancers,
male and female, ranged in age from 3 to 85.
   Dawn broke at Coney Island with ``waves,'' children frm three
Staten Island public schools dancing in blue leotards. They were
joined by king crabs, in shades of red, and sea gulls with white
gauze capes over green leotards. Arpita Patel was their graceful
leader.
   Then a family entered the beach: Donlin Foreman from the Martha
Graham Dance Company as Mama, in a big white wig; Deni Lamont from
the New York City Ballet as Papa; small Alvin Fung with his wrist
in a cast, and Broadway dancer Valerie Wright.
   One of the most amusing dances was ``Sand Fleas'' by children
from Assumption-All Saints and St. Patrick's schools of Jersey
City. They began by lying on beach blankets. Then one foot
scratched the other ankle and soon they were up, dancing with much
scratching and shaking.
   Coney Island senior citizens and children from a public school
and a junior high for the deaf danced playing ballgames on the
beach. Children from four public schools and an intermediate school
in Brooklyn became a wonderful roller coaster.
   Children from five Chinatown public schools danced ``By the
Beautiful Sea,'' followed by a lively ``Boom Box Dance'' by
children from eight elementary and intermediate schools.
   Senior citizens from Chinatown received much applause for their
delicate ``Yet Yee'' dance. Seven deaf children danced and signed a
story of immigration, ``Grandmother's Mattress,'' written by
d'Amboise.
   Policemen nabbed Kevin Vaughan, trying to steal ``Mama's''
purse, while Judy Collins, who participates every year, sang a song
she wrote for the occasion.
   This year's recital was one of the events of the ``First New
York International Festival of the Arts.''

<HEAD>North Dakotans Again Reject Lottery; L.L. Bean Heiress Loses in
Maine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   North Dakota voters again refused to jump on the lottery
bandwagon, Maine Republicans rejected a $500,000 bid by an L.L.
Bean heiress for a congressional nomination, and Virginians sent a
Democrat to Washington in a special election.
   With 77 percent of the North Dakota vote counted from Tuesday's
election, the lottery proposal was losing by 41,505 votes or 59
percent to 28,391 votes or 41 percent.
   That was an even wider margin than the 55-45 percent it lost by
in November 1986, when North Dakotans became the first voters to
reject a state-run lottery. Twenty-six states and the District of
Columbia have lotteries.
   ``It would seem to me a decisive expression of the will of the
people, and I would hope that the proponents would accept the
decision,'' said former Gov. Arthur Link, who opposed the measure
as a regressive tax on the poor.
   Link found allies in some of North Dakota's charitable gaming
operators, who feared a lottery would cut into their business.
   Gorman King Sr., a businessman who backed a lottery, said the
initiative might be resubmitted in November with revenues dedicated
to a specific program, such as education or aid to the elderly.
King and other supporters said a lottery would raise $7 million a
year for the economically depressed state.
   North Dakotans also had a meaningless, last-in-the-nation
presidential primary. No Democrats entered the race, and on the GOP
side, Vice President George Bush racked up 94 percent of the vote
against retired teacher Mary Jane Rachner.
   In Maine's southern 1st Congressional District, Linda
Bean-Jones, the granddaughter of outdoors outfitter L.L. Bean, was
edged by Edward S. O'Meara, an aide to Sen. William Cohen, for the
GOP nomination. O'Meara will face popular Democratic Rep. Joseph E.
Brennan, a former two-term governor.
   With 96 percent of the vote counted, O'Meara had 15,313 votes or
52 percent and Bean-Jones had 14,102 votes or 48 percent.
   ``Recounts don't seem to pay off,'' Bean-Jones said. ``I'm still
going to be around. We're not going to disappear. I feel I have a
role to play in politics.''
   Bean-Jones, founder of a defunct conservative publication known
as The Maine Paper, spent about $550,000 on her first political

   In southside Virginia's 5th Congressional District, Democrat
L.F. Payne Jr., developer of a ski and golf resort, defeated former
White House aide Linda Arey in a special election. The incumbent,
conservative Democrat W.C. ``Dan'' Daniel, died of a heart attack
in January while serving his 10th term.
   The final count showed Payne with 55,406 votes or 59 percent to
Ms. Arey's 38,086 votes or 41 percent.
   Payne and Ms. Arey are slated to run against each other again in
November, but Ms. Arey could withdraw and ask the GOP to choose
another nominee.
   South Carolina also had a primary Tuesday, but only one
incumbent congressman faced opposition. In the 6th District,
three-term Democratic Rep. Robin Tallon won 89 percent of the vote
against retired postal worker Luther Lighty, who had also
challenged him in 1984 and 1986.

<HEAD>Scientists Propose Putting Genetically Altered Cells Into Humans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors at the National Institutes of Health
are proposing a cancer research experiment that would for the first
time involve putting genetically altered cells into humans,
according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported today that the proposal would call
for doctors to remove human cells from the body, genetically alter
them by inserting a ``marker'' gene into a type of cancer-fighting
cell and return the altered cell to the body.
   The newspaper said the procedure is designed to track
cancer-fighting cells and not as a treatment for cancer. Scientists
hope the experiment could open the door for gene therapy as a
possible route to finding cures for such illnesses as cystic
fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia.
   ``It is not the sort of experiment that one would normally think
of as gene therapy,'' said Dr. William Gartland who heads a NIH
gene research advisory committee.
   The research team would be led by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the
National Cancer Institute and Dr. W. French Anderson of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, according to the
newspaper.
   The Post said Rosenberg has conducted a similar skin cancer
experiment. In his procedure, pieces of a tumor along with white
blood cells called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are removed. The
lymphocytes, or TIL cells, are already attacking the tumor when
they are removed.
   The TIL cell count is multiplied by 10 trillion over 30 days in
the laboratory, using a white blood cell growth hormone called
interleukin-2. The increased number of TIL cells and more
interleukin-2 are then injected into the body.
   Rosenberg's has not been able to determine why his treatment has
worked with some patients and not with others, because the only way
he has been able to track the TIL cells is by using harmful
radiation. Hence the development of the ``marker'' gene proposed in
his joint project with Anderson.
   However the report said it could be a year before the
gene-altering experiment proposed by Rosenberg and Anderson gets
under way.
   The proposal faces review by a board of scientists and ethics
experts at the cancer institute, hearing before at least three
other panels and NIH director James B. Wyngaarden before final
approval.

   George Bush calls horseshoes the ``national
sport'' and brags that he can beat Michael Dukakis in November just
as handily as he won a horseshoe demonstration for Italian
journalists.
   Bush showed off his horseshoe prowess on Tuesday as he awaited a
visit from Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita at his residence
here on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory.
   The vice president first served cold soft drinks to the group of
U.S. and Italian reporters and photographers, then offered to kill
time ``until we here the sirens'' of De Mita's motorcade by showing
the Italians some horseshoe technique.
   ``Do they play horseshoes in Italy?'' Bush asked. ``Is it the
national sport like it is here?''
   ``You're seeing it here, history. We're getting closer to the
poles. The poles are coming the right way. In horseshoes and in
real life,'' Bush said as he lobbed horseshoes at a metal pole in a
dirt pit alongside his home.
   ``Get on!'' he shouted at his final horseshoe as it clanged up
against the pole, defeating ABC television producer Steve Hirsh by
a score of 3-2.
   ``You've seen it here, right at the vice president's house, you
saw history in the making. This is the forerunner of what's going
to happen in the election in November l988,'' Bush said, hamming it
up for the Italian television cameras. ``So tell the Italian people
you saw it here...You saw it all.''
   Despite Bush's optimistic talk, a Gallup poll released Tuesday
suggested Dukakis holds a double-digit lead over Bush.
   The poll, conducted by Gallup for the Boston Globe and Boston
television stations WEEI and WCVB, found 52 percent support for
Dukakis and 38 percent for Bush. The poll, conducted June 10-12
among 1,005 registered voters, had a margin of sampling error of
four percentage points.
   ``I don't believe in polls at this time. I really don't,'' the
vice president told reporters.
   On another subject, Bush said Dukakis was ``wrong, wrong ...
wrong twice'' in opposing the Strategic Defense Initiative and the
MX missile.
   And, asked whether he would consider Howard H. Baker, the White
House chief of staff who retired Tuesday, as a possible running
mate, Bush said, ``No talk about a vice president. It's too early.''
   Baker told CBS News on Tuesday, ``I don't expect to be asked, I
do not wish to be asked and I'm doing nothing to try to be asked.''

<HEAD>Machine Promises To Extend Preservation Of Donor Organs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists built a machine that could make
transplants more available by allowing donor organs to be shipped
worldwide, but it also may intensify debate over surgery costs and
the fairness of organ distribution.
   The machine has preserved sheep and pig hearts up to 24 hours,
and should be ready in three years to preserve human hearts,
livers, kidneys and other tissues, including limbs, for 72 hours or
more, said co-inventor Ralph Purdy, a University of California,
Irvine, pharmacologist.
   Technology now in routine use by transplant centers preserves
hearts for only four to five hours, livers for 12 hours and kidneys
for 48 hours, limiting how far organs can be transported, he said
Tuesday.
   If the device works on human organs, ``it would be a revolution
in transplantation ... because there now are a significant
proportion of donor hearts that are lost because they cannot be
transported to recipients in time,'' said Arthur Caplan, director
of the University of Minnesota Center for Biomedical Ethics.
   However, the machine could make it more difficult to allocate
organs fairly ``because more people will be eligible here and
overseas to get these organs,'' he said from Minneapolis.
   Caplan said that while about $3 billion is spent annually on
U.S. organ transplants, the machine developed in Irvine will
``force us to address a question we haven't addressed head-on,
which is how much do we want to spend on transplants.''
   ``We've been able to escape having to think how much to spend
because there's (now) a limit on the number of organs available,''
he added. ``With a machine like this, you could easily conceive of
increasing the number of available organs by 50 percent or more
because you can procure donors anywhere in the world.''
   The possibility of a global donor pool means ethical rules must
be developed to prevent officials or residents of developing
nations from exporting organs that were obtained unscrupulously,
said Jim Martindale, co-inventor of the machine.
   ``The nightmare is that someone sells their brother, sister or
child'' to killers who commit murder to harvest the organs, he
added.
   Caplan predicted the machine will be used on human organs within
three years because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will be
pressured to approve it because of its great lifesaving potential.
   The University of California has applied for a patent on the
device, so the protoype machine, which can fit on a hospital cart,
wasn't displayed during a news conference.
   However, the key portion is a clear, plastic cylinder in which a
donor organ is placed. It is attached to a pump to push oxygen-rich
artificial blood through an organ or limb, and to other devices
that automatically maintain proper temperature, pressure, oxygen
and nutrient levels and also carry off wastes.
   Purdy displayed a videotape showing a sheep's heart pumping in
the cylinder at a rate of 10 times per minute, partly by its own
action but also aided by a separate pump. Existing preservation
methods bathe the heart in near-freezing solutions to halt pumping.
   Even though donor organs are removed from brain-dead accident
victims, many people may feel repulsed at the idea of shipping
beating hearts because it may seem ``disrespectful to the body,''
Caplan said.
   Purdy said the ability to maintain organs for longer periods
will allow medical research on organs that are unfit for transplant
but suitable for testing new drugs or medical procedures.
   Caplan said that will raise ethical problems for doctors who
will have to ask relatives of a dead person to donate their loved
ones' organs for use in research rather than for transplantation.
   In February 1987, researchers from Gulf South Research Institute
in Louisiana said they had developed the Total Organ Perfusion
System, which also uses a pump and special fluid to preserve
organs. They said they had preserved pigs' hearts for 24 hours, but
didn't think the degree of preservation was adequate.
   Last September, surgeons at the University of Wisconsin
announced they were using a new mix of chemicals to preserve donor
livers more than 24 hours.

<TEXT>
   Democratic National Chairman Paul G. Kirk says
he believes the differences on issues between factions backing
Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson will be resolved to ensure party
unity.
   His Republican counterpart, Frank Fahrenkopf, puts it a little
differently.
   ``They'll cut a deal,'' Fahrenkopf said.
   In a sometimes testy, occasionally funny and mostly good-natured
debate Tuesday night, the two party chairmen squared off on a host
of issues, including the economy, foreign policy, their respective
presidential candidates and Jackson.
   Asked by an audience member what the party would do about
Jackson, Kirk responded that at the platform meeting this past
weekend the backers of Michael Dukakis and Jackson ``were together
... working in a civil and constructive way about issues, about the
future.''
   ``I think Rev. Jackson has run a very positive campaign and I
think he'll make a constructive and positive impact on the fall
results,'' Kirk added.
   ``Within the platform there may be some differences, there may
be some votes on the floor of the convention, I don't think they'll
be the kind of issues that will divide the party. I think they can
... make some statements which are important as well.''
   Fahrenkopf, who wasn't specifically asked about Jackson, blurted
out, ``They'll cut a deal.''
   The Republican chairman also criticized Kirk for what he
described as the Democratic failure to come up with a party
platform detailing where they stand on major issues.
   ``You say, `We're for peace, and we're for everyone having a job
and for good education,' and you won't level with the American
people and tell the American people in a platform how you're going
to arrive at it,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``You're afraid to put that on
the table.''
   Democrats met this past weekend in Michigan, where they agreed
that their platform must brand South Africa a terrorist state, but
sidestepped the question of the federal budget deficit and whether
to call for higher taxes on the rich.
   At the debate, Kirk criticized the Reagan administration's
economic and foreign policies.
   ``The United States of America went from the largest creditor
nation in the world to the largest debtor nation in the world in
five years under the Republican Party,'' Kirk said.
   The Democratic chairman, noting the Iran-Contra scandal, said
the nation has seen ``a foreign policy in disarray, operating on
deceit, diversion and deniability.''
   Kirk and Fahrenkopf referred to the issues that the two
presidential contenders, Dukakis and Republican George Bush, are
expected to focus on in the months leading up to the general
election.
   Fahrenkopf pointed to a strong economy with high unemployment
and a lower trade deficit. He also noted the better relationship
between the United States and Soviet Union.
   Kirk noted the administration's failure to balance the budget
and cited Dukakis' success in achieving that goal in Massachusetts.

   Two would-be bank robbers rushed into
what used to be the First Alabama Bank, ordered employees into what
used to be a teller's station and finally realized the building now
houses an accountant's office.
   Police said the masked gunmen fled the building Monday, leaving
behind the black bag they intended to fill with cash.
   ``They got mud on their faces and no money,'' police Capt. Doug
Lee said.
   The accounting firm of Ninas Easter Co. has been in the former
bank since last month, and has had several visitors walk in
thinking the bank was still there.
   H. Russell Ninas said the two men pulled open drawers looking
for money until they realized their mistake.
   ``I kept telling them this is not a bank,'' Ninas said.
   Though the firm has its own signs in front of the building,
Ninas said he is considering adding a sign to say: ``This is not a
bank.''
   The two intruders were not captured, police said.

<HEAD>In Major Policy Shift, Ortega Lifts Price, Wage Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major policy shift, President
Daniel Ortega has lifted wage and price controls and instituted
massive austerity measures in an attempt to salvage the
war-battered economy.
   Speaking on nationwide television Tuesday night, he called the
crisis ``deep and serious'' and said the economy can survive only
through the adoption of a series of measures ``similar to those
taken by capitalist countries.''
   Ortega's leftist Sandinista regime had been tightening controls
over the economy since it seized power in a 1979 revolution.
   Virtually all prices have been fixed by the government, and
employers have been barred from raising salaries without government
permission.
   From now on, Ortega said, employers and workers will agree on
wages independently and prices will be regulated only by market
conditions.
   He said the government occasionally will announce nominal
guidelines on prices of some basic products to keep them from going
up too quickly. It will also remove a host of subsidies, with the
exception of public transportation and cooking oil, soap, rice and
sugar _ all of which are in short supply.
   To reduce an estimated annual inflation rate of 4,000 to 5,000
percent, Ortega said the government will restrict credit and
closely regulate interest rates to reduce the money supply and
force businessmen to reinvest profits.
   To reduce the foreign balance of payments deficit, Ortega
announced 30 percent cuts across-the-board in defense imports,
imports for farm and ranch production, and diplomatic expenditures
abroad.
   Nicaragua has a foreign debt of more than $6 billion. Soviet
bloc infusions of about $400 million a year fail to cover the
country's trade deficit. Exports this year are expected to total
$270 million while imports, excluding Soviet bloc weapons, are
totaling $700 million.
   The amount of Soviet bloc weapons imported annually has not been
made public, but Ortega has said the 6{-year war with U.S.-backed
Contra rebels has cost the country $3 billion in property damage
and lost production.
   For the past five years, more than half the national budget has
been devoted to defense spending. From 1980 to the end of 1987,
inflation caused the average urban worker's purchasing power to
drop almost 90 percent.
   Ortega made the announcement Tuesday at a meeting of 1,200
Sandinista labor leaders, managers of state-owned enterprises and
other government officials. He said that even though the Sandinista
``revolution is socialist-oriented, we cannot think of abolishing
private property.''
   He called Nicaragua's present economy ``a free market one, in a
revolutionary state that is socialist-oriented.''
   Ortega blamed the battered economy on the war and an economic
blockade imposed by the United States shortly after the Sandinistas
began establishing close economic and military ties with the Soviet
Union and its allies.
   Meanwhile, the Sandinistas are continuing to push for more
negotiations to achieve a lasting peace.
   A cease-fire, initially in force for 60 days beginning April 1
and later tacitly extended by both sides, appeared to be holding.
   Because of the war, thousands of people have fled fertile lands
for the cities and many young peasants who normally would work on
farms were forced to fight for either the Contras or the
Sandinistas.
   In April, the government began laying off 20,000 public
employees in hopes they would turn to agriculture.

   Fundamentalists tightened their grip
on the Southern Baptist Convention by electing another conservative
president, who said he hopes to mend the division in the nation's
largest Protestant denomination.
   The Rev. Jerry Vines, who narrowly defeated a moderate Tuesday,
said the denomination has turned rightward because of ``strong
grass-roots feelings on the part of our people.''
   Vines also told a news conference he hoped ``we can move in the
direction of healing'' the bitter conflict between conservative and
moderate Southern Baptists.
   Meanwhile, a moderate group, the Southern Baptist Alliance, said
Vines' election left them ``disenfranchised.''
   ``Diversity is rejected and dishonored,'' said a statement from
the group, headed by the Rev. John Thompson of Jackson, Miss.
``Fundamentalist, authoritarian, hierarchical and right-wing
political ideology'' now prevailed, it said.
   Vines defeated the Rev. Richard Jackson by 15,804 to 15,112. But
similarly close votes in the past have not deterred extension of
the fundamentalist platform.
   Vines, 50, is co-pastor of the First Baptist Church of
Jacksonville, Fla., while Jackson, 49, is pastor of the North
Phoenix Baptist Church in Phoenix, Ariz. Each church has about
18,000 members.
   Vines' victory represents the 10th straight year fundamentalists
have gained the powerful presidency, completing a timetable set by
their strategist in 1979 for solidifying their control over the
denomination. The president serves a one-year term, but it is
traditionally renewed a second year.
   The outcome also signaled indefinite continuation of a
right-wing theological and political agenda that has accompanied
the fundamentalist dominance.
   Because of the size and nationwide influence of the
14.7-million-member denomination, the direction set here was seen
as having an impact in broader evangelical circles.
   Asked why Southern Baptist positions on social and political
issues have come to match those of the religious right, Vines cited
``grass-roots feelings'' and said members ``reflect the general
mood, the conservative directions of this time.''
   Jackson wryly discounted that explanation, saying the ``grass
roots are often quoted, but you don't hear them talking much.''
   ``I feel there is manipulation,'' he said. ``It would have been
unthinkable 20 years ago that a small group could get together and
work out plans'' for taking control of the denomination.
   The key architects of that plan, Judge Paul Pressler of Houston
and the Rev. Paige Patterson of Dallas, determined that by
successively winning the presidency, conservatives could gradually
pack ruling boards of denominational agencies and seminaries
through the appointive power of the office.
   The fundamentalist victories have been achieved under the banner
of biblical ``inerrancy'' _ that the Bible is without error,
scientically, historically and religiously.
   But they have been accompanied by conservative positions on
political and social issues, such as unsuccessfully supporting
Judge Robert Bork for the U.S. Supreme Court, and favoring capital
punishment, prayer in public schools and aid to private schools.
   Vines said he hoped the denomination would not lose members over
the conflict. ``I want to include, not exclude,'' he said.
   Asked if he would seek only like-minded people as trustees of
church institutions and agencies, he said they must be within
approved ``parameters,'' that is, biblical ``inerrantists.''
   Several seminary and other church staff members have been
pressured from their jobs by new screening processes instituted by
the fundamentalists. Among the questions asked church employees is
whether they believe Adam and Eve were real people and that
biblical miracles actually occurred.
   Vines said the political ramifications of the fundamentalist
upsurge were ``spinoffs'' from the theological concerns.
   Jackson said the split ``obviously isn't over theology,'' but
over different styles of leadership, since he accepts the Bible's
infallibilty, but he respects those holding other views.
   ``I believe we'll stay together, may God deliver us,'' he said.
``I don't want anybody to panic.''

<HEAD>Hong Kong to End Policy of Accepting All Boat People As Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will no longer grant asylum to
all Vietnamese in an effort to stem the growing influx of boat
people, a Hong Kong official said today.
   Effective Thursday, the government will screen all Vietnamese
boat people entering the British colony's waters to determine if
they are political refugees or economic migrants, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Boat people who left their homeland for economic reasons will be
housed in a prison-like camp on an outlying island of Hong Kong
pending an agreement with Vietnam on repatriation, the official
said.
   Chief Secretary Sir David Ford planned to announce the change of
policy today before the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's lawmaking
body.
   Hong Kong long has assumed all arriving boat people are refugees
eligible for temporary asylum. They are housed in refugee camps
pending resettlement in a third country such as the United States
or Canada.
   But local officials say many left Vietnam for economic reasons,
not to escape political persecution, and finding resettlement homes
for them has become increasingly difficult.
   About 7,800 boat people have braved the treacherous trip from
Vietnam to Hong Kong this year through Tuesday, or 12 times the
number who arrived during the corresponding period last year,
government statistics show. The number of boat people has soared to
about 16,200.
   Only 1,200 boat people left Hong Kong camps for resettlement
this year through Tuesday, up slightly from the corresponding
period last year.
   The boat people already in the colony will not be affected by
the new policy, the government official said.
   Other non-communist Southeast Asian governments recently have
changed their policy toward accepting Vietnamese boat people.
   Thailand earlier this year pushed back to sea Vietnamese boats
attempting to land and several deaths were reported. Bangkok backed
off after sharp international criticism and reopened its doors, but
insisted the new arrivals would not be eligible for resettlement.
   Malaysia announced in April it would begin turning away boat
people at some unspecified future date.

<HEAD>Parliament Rejects Law To Narrow Definition Of Jew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After debate that pitted Orthodox against more
liberal Jews, Parliament narrowly defeated legislation that would
hve restricted the definition of a Jew and thus limited who could
immigrate to Israel.
   Jewish communities abroad, particularly in the United States,
had a special interest in the measures because of Israel's unique
Law of Return, which guarantees automatic citizenship to all Jews
who qualify under Israeli law.
   The two proposals would have recognized as Jewish only those
converts who were brought into the faith by Orthodox rabbis, not
those converted by Reform or Conservative rabbis.
   One proposal would have amended the Law of Return and the other
would have put the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel in charge of
determining who is a Jew.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told American Jews he would not
support the so-called ``Who's a Jew amendments,'' but voted for
them in the Knesset and enforced party discipline on others of his
right-wing Likud bloc to follow suit. Still, the two proposals
failed by votes of 60-53 and 60-51.
   During intense debate, Rabbi Meir Kahane, an American-born
member of Parliament know for his anti-Arab views, was ejected from
the chamber.
   The 120-member Knesset also rejected a bill providing pardons
for Jews now jailed for terrorist acts against Arabs, including
murder.
   Avraham Verdiger, who proposed the Who's a Jew legislation, said
it would ``maintain the purity'' of the Jewish people, preserve the
``uniqueness'' of Jews and help stop Jews in other countries from
assimilating into the general population.
   In the United States especially, members of Judiasm's
Conservative and Reform movements greatly outnumber the Orthodox,
who oppose intermarriage.
   Despite Shamir's promises to defeat the proposals, his
right-wing Likud bloc bound its members to vote for them because of
pledges to the small ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which has supported
Likud on other issues.
   Small religious parties have a total of only 13 seats in the
Knesset but hold a disproportionate amount of power because they
are potential coalition partners for the major political groups _
Likud and the center-left Labor Party led by Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres.

<DATELINE>PLAINSBORO, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smaller is better in the case of what
researchers are calling the world's fastest and most powerful
supercomputer.
   The machine, dedicated Tuesday at the von Neumann National
Supercomputer Center near Princeton, will be about 170,000 times
faster than the best home computers, yet small enough so that its
main components could slide inside a briefcase.
   By the middle of next year, after four more processors are
added, it will be able to handle more than 10 billion calculations
a second, a capacity greater than any other computer, said Carl S.
Ledbetter, president of ETA Systems Inc., the computer's
Minnesota-based manufacturer.
   Researchers are expected to use the ETA10 computer to advance
scientific discovery in fields like aerospace engineering, weather
forecasting and pharmaceuticals.
   ``By expanding the computational power of our facilities in raw
speed and scope, we intend to inspire researchers to tackle a new
genre of complex problems only supercomputers can efficiently
solve,'' said Doyle D. Knight, a Rutgers University engineering
professor and president of the consortium that manages the center.
   Ledbetter said the computer is the product of several
technological advances.
   It has smaller, denser computer chips than its predecessor, and
uses copper ``tracings'' instead of miles of conventional wire.
This reduces the space electrons have to travel, enabling faster
calculations, Ledbetter said.
   In another advancement, the circuits are dipped in supercool
liquid nitrogen, enabling the electrons to move at an even faster
pace.
   This generates less heat than other semi-conductor technology,
allowing the computer's designers to make ETA10 even smaller
because ``when things are cooler you can put them closer
together,'' Ledbetter said.
   ``One of the ironies of these supercomputers is that they are
very small,'' Ledbetter said.
   The ``brain'' of the ETA10, which will cost $25 million to $30
million, will be eight processors, each 16-by-22-by-.25 inches. The
first four processors were delivered to the von Neumann Center in
March and have been operating for several weeks.
   The four-processor computer can now handle 3.4 billion
arithmetic calculations per second, making it one of the world's
fastest supercomputers, Ledbetter said.
   According to researchers, the supercomputer will enable them to
attack problems too complex for earlier generations of
supercomputers to handle in any reasonable length of time. One
reason is that the new computer will be able to handle many more
variables at the same time, Ledbetter said.
   At a news conference Tuesday, researchers demonstrated a
detailed, three-dimensional model of a protein molecule that took
the ETA10 two hours to create. It would have taken an average home
computer more than a year to do the task, one researcher said.
   ``Some of the things that can be done include very sophisticated
weather-modeling programs. They can do three- and four- and
seven-day forecasts much more accurately than had ever been done
before,'' Ledbetter said.
   The center, one of five national supercomputer centers, is
managed by the Consortium for Scientific Computing Inc., consisting
of the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the
University of Colorado, the University of Rochester, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Institute for Advanced
Study and Brown, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Penn State, New York
and Rutgers universities.
   Researchers from those schools will be able to use the
supercomputer from their campuses.
   The center was established in 1985 with a commitment of $69.2
million in funding from the National Science Foundation and $12.1
million from the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III has ruled
that a member of the Irish Republican Army convicted of murder
should be deported to the United Kingdom, overturning a decision by
the Board of Immigration Appeals.
   Meese said Tuesday that deporting Joseph Patrick Thomas Doherty
to Ireland instead would be against U.S. interests.
   Doherty was convicted in the United Kingdom in 1981 of murder in
the ambush of a British army convoy in which a captain was killed.
   Doherty escaped from a prison in Belfast, Northern Ireland,
before sentencing, came to the United States in 1982 and has been
held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City since
1983 on charges he illegally entered the country using a false
passport.
   Michael Armacost, undersecretary of state for political affairs,
wrote the attorney general that a decision to deport Doherty to
Ireland could undermine Great Britain's ``confidence in the ability
of the United States to cooperate in counter-terrorism efforts.''

   Two former presidential candidates in opposing
parties and usually at opposite ends of the political spectrum are
urging Israel to deal directly with Palestinians in seeking a
Middle East peace.
   Barry Goldwater and George McGovern joined in saying Israel
should recognize the ``national legitimacy'' of Arab Palestinians
and turn over territory to them in exchange for peace.
   McGovern, the losing Democratic standard bearer in 1972, and
Goldwater, the losing Republican in 1964, signed a statement
endorsing the peace proposal along with former European government
heads Garrett Fitzgerald of Ireland, Anker Jorgensen of Denmark and
Bruno Kreisky of Austria.
   Their proposal differs from the plan unsuccessfully pursued by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and strongly implies _ but does
not specifically recommend _ creation of a Palestinian state.

   The government is not doing enough to protect
the public from all-terrain vehicles, according to a pair of
senators who have introduced legislation to require the Consumer
Product Safety to ban the sale of three-wheeled models.
   Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.,
proposed the legislation, which would also require the CPSC to
establish a procedure for owners to obtain refunds.
   The commission ``has not done an adequate job in protecting the
consumer from the inherent risks and dangers associated with
ATVs,'' D'Amato said at a press conference on Tuesday. ``It is time
for Congress to force their hand in this matter.''
   Gore said ATVs have been linked to nearly 1,000 deaths and more
than 350,000 injuries requiring medical treatment since 1982.
   Of the 2.5 million ATVs now in use, about two-thirds are
three-wheeled models.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission says
500,000 Black & Decker weed trimmers that could pose an

   Involved are Black & Decker Model 82209 and Model 82210
bump-feed string trimmers used on grass and weeds.
   Because of an error in wiring, the electrical wires in some of
the trimmers could be cut by the handle tube, causing a potential

<TEXT>
   The burning of woodlands, apparently the latest
tactic of the Palestinian uprising, has spurred an outcry among
Israeli Jews whose founding fathers prided themselves on making the
deserts bloom.
   Israelis gathered in emergency meetings across the country
Tuesday to develop ways to fight the fires in the nation's scarce
forests.
   In one of three meetings on the fire threat, police and army
officers, security agents and members of the Jewish National Fund
agreed to set up three regional centers to coordinate information
on fires.
   In the Galilee village of Kfar Tabor, Israeli Arab and Jewish
village leaders agreed to create volunteer civil guards to carry
out patrols.
   But they dismissed a proposal for joint patrols, saying that the
current tensions between Jews and Arabs could make such patrols
counterproductive.
   Since May, 28,700 acres of woodland and pasture have been
destroyed by fire, said Lenny Labensohn, a spokesman for the Jewish
National Fund, which is responsible for afforestation and land
reclamation in Israel.
   Labensohn's figure is six times the average acreage normally
lost to fire in a year.
   Labensohn and police officials say a ``significant number'' of
the fires have been set by Palestinians who oppose Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Ten Palestinians have been arrested on suspicion of setting
fires. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has called for mandatory
15-year sentences for anyone convicted of arson, and his suggestion
has been taken up by others.
   ``It is not possible to know for sure how many fires are the
work of arsonists,'' Labensohn said. ``But when we see trees
burning that we planted with our own sweat and blood, it's very
hard to take. It just causes more damage to Jewish-Arab relations.''
   Early Jewish pioneers to Israel, often acting with funds
contributed from the United States and other countries, worked to
fill swamplands and plant trees on marginal land.
   They dubbed the border between Israel and the West Bank in 1948
the ``green line,'' in part to emphasize the extent to which the
land had been cultivated.
   Jews living outside Israel planted trees in memory of deceased
relatives or Holocaust victims. American donations have planted 20
million trees in Israeli national parks, more than 10 percent of
the country's trees.
   The Israeli army has sometimes uprooted trees and olive groves
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip from which Palestinians
were suspected of throwing firebombs or stones at Israelis.
   On June 10, Israeli troops broke up a tree-planting ceremony by
left-wing Israelis in the West Bank village of Beita, scene of the
April 6 clash between the villagers and teen-age Israeli hikers in
which a Jewish girl was killed.
   The Israelis were planting trees to protest the army's uprooting
of orchards and demolition of 14 Arab houses as punishment for the
clash.

<HEAD>Family: Never Heard About Soviet Apology From Pentagon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDDING, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of a U.S. Army officer shot to
death by a Soviet guard in East Germany in 1985 says it was ``very
gross'' of the Pentagon to fail to tell the family that Moscow had
apologized.
   The Soviet Union's highest-ranking military official apologized
last month during the Moscow summit for the shooting death of Maj.
Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., the Pentagon announced Tuesday.
   Nicholson's parents said it was the first they had heard about
the apology. Nicholson's mother, Jean Nicholson, said she was
pleased to hear an apology had been made, but ``we've had no word
from the government at all.''
   ``I never thought this would happen,'' she said of the apology.
   Nicholson's father, Arthur Sr., said he called his son's widow
in Washington, and she said she hadn't heard of the apology.
   ``I'm somewhat distressed that nobody made any effort to notify
us,'' he said. ``I think this is very gross.''
   Nicholson said he did not want to comment on the apology itself
until he heard its contents.
   The apology was extended by Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov
to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci at a private meeting May 31,
said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   Yazov offered no new details or explanation for the March 24,
1985, shooting, nor did he respond to previous U.S. demands for
financial compensation to Nicholson's family, Howard said.
   Nonetheless, ``we feel we have received the appropriate apology
from the Soviets,'' the spokesman said.
   In addition, Howard said, ``The two sides agreed to come up with
a list of recent such incidents, violations, whatever, and to meet
again to try to work out a set of ground rules.''
   Howard quoted Yazov as saying: ``I express my regret over the
incident and am sorry this occurred. This does not promote improved
relations. Secretary Carlucci and I have agreed we will do all we
can to prevent these kinds of incidents in the future.''
   Howard disclosed the apology during a regular Pentagon briefing.
He said he did not disclose it at the summit because no reporters
asked about the matter.
   Nicholson, 37, was a member of the U.S. Military Liaison
Mission, allowed under a 1947 treaty to keep tabs on Soviet
military activities inside East Germany.
   Nicholson and a driver, Sgt. Jessie G. Schatz, were trying to
observe a Soviet tank shed during a surveillance mission. According
to the U.S. account, Nicholson was close to _ but not in _ a
restricted area when a Soviet sentry suddenly opened fire without
warning.
   The Pentagon has charged that Schatz was prevented from going to
the wounded man with his first aid kit and that the major was left
to die without medical attention.
   The Soviets have said Nicholson was improperly wearing a
camouflaged uniform, had strayed into a restricted area and ignored
shouted warnings before the sentry opened fire.

<HEAD>Principal Stalks Out On Japanese Delegation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meeting between Japanese anti-nuclear
activists and officials of a high school whose symbol is a nuclear
mushroom broke up when the principal angrily declared that the
United States wasn't to blame for World War II, then left.
   Tuesday's meeting was called to discuss Japanese objections to
the Richland High School symbol, which celebrates the area's role
in the production of U.S. nuclear arms _ including plutonium in the
bomb that destroyed Nagasaki in World War II.
   ``We are not going to change our symbol because we believe it
has something to do with the heritage of our community,'' Principal
John Nash told a delegation of 35 Japanese who visited this town
adjacent to the giant Hanford nuclear reservation.
   ``I heard some things here that made me angry,'' Nash said. ``We
can go back to history and recall a lot of things about the war and
I could say some things here that would be very disruptive to you
people, but I'm not about to do this,'' Nash said.
   ``But I'm going to say one thing and you should remember this.
We did not start that war and I think that should end it.''
   Nash then walked out of the classroom, to the loud applause of
some residents in the south-central Washington city, leaving the
visitors to talk with faculty, students and reporters.
   ``It was not our intention to protest,'' said Masa Takubo, of
Washington, D.C., who served as interpreter. ``We wanted to present
our views and we wanted to understand his views.
   ``Unfortunately he had to leave in anger,'' Takubo said.
   ``I was embarrassed at my ex-principal,'' said Marcia Cilian, a
Richland High graduate. ``He interpreted it the wrong way. They
were not asking us to change it, just look at it another way.''
   Hours later, about 100 people who largely supported the Japanese
visitors attended an evening with them at the Richland Public
Library.
   However, Mary Baird, of Richland, defended the dropping of
atomic bombs on Japan at the end of the war, saying they prevented
even greater slaughter of Americans and Japanese.
   ``It's unfortunate that a nuclear war occurred, but I will not
accept the blame for my country,'' she said, noting that the
Japanese launched hostilities in the Pacific.
   The Japanese visitors have been in this country since May, when
they attended a United Nations special session on disarmament in
New York. Since then, they have been touring U.S. nuclear
facilities.
   Hanford was created by the Manhattan Project in World War II to
make plutonium for nuclear weapons. The jobs of up to 30,000
Richland residents are tied to the nuclear weapons industry, and
criticism of their role in that work is a sore point with many
locals.
   Earlier this year, an attempt by some teachers and residents to
eliminate the mushroom cloud symbol of the Richland High School
Bombers was overwhelmingly defeated in a student election, when
students voted instead to officially adopt the cloud as their
symbol.
   The widespread media attention given that election attracted the
Japanese delegation.
   Tuesday's meeting began quietly, with Nash escorting the
visitors into a classroom and welcoming them.
   But the meeting turned sour when Sakae Ito, a 77-year-old
survivor of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, made a lengthy speech
about military symbolism and asked Nash to change the school symbol
to something more peaceful ``like cranes or rainbows.''
   ``The mushroom cloud reminds us of the tragedy of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki,'' she said through the interpreter. ``I feel sorry and
sad people here support the mushroom cloud.''
   Nash replied that many athletic teams in the United States used
aggressive symbols and noted that students voted to make the cloud
their official emblem.
   ``I'm not going to change it,'' he said before walking out.

<BYLINE>Blood Protein Predicts Diabetes, May Play Role in Disease
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People on their way to developing the most
serious form of diabetes may be identifiable far in advance of the
disease, and the illness may then be prevented, a study suggests.
   Scientists found that an abnormal blood protein appears up to
seven years before a person develops the kind of diabetes that
requires daily insulin shots.
   The protein was detectable in all 12 study subjects who
developed insulin-dependent diabetes from three months to seven
years later. It also appeared in 18 of 20 newly diagnosed diabetics
but not in any of 18 non-diabetics of similar ages, researchers
said.
   While other blood proteins have shown some ability to predict
who will get insulin-dependent diabetes, none has shown such
promise for accuracy, said Mark Atkinson, clinical research fellow
in pathology at the University of Florida College of Medicine in
Gainesville.
   The protein may play a central role in causing the disease, and
strategies against it may be able to prevent insulin-dependent
diabetes from developing, he said in an interview before presenting
the study Tuesday at the American Diabetes Association's annual
scientific sessions in New Orleans.
   George Eisenbarth of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, who
was familiar with the research, said it was important because it
confirms earlier indications that blood tests based on the protein
can be used to help predict diabetes.
   He also said there are other candidates for the role in causing
the disease that Atkinson suggests for the protein.
   About 1 million Americans are thought to have insulin-dependent
diabetes. They need insulin shots because their bodies do not
produce insulin.
   Insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas. The cells
are destroyed by insulin-dependent diabetes. The disease is thought
to arise from a misguided attack on those cells by the body's
disease-fighting immune system.
   Nobody knows what triggers the attack, but Atkinson suggests it
is carried out by the protein in his study.
   The protein is an antibody, a substance created by blood cells
of the immune system to attack specific targets such as
disease-causing microbes. The antibody in Atkinson's study reacts
with a protein found on the surface of the beta cells but not in
other tissues examined, Atkinson said.
   That fact and its early appearance are evidence that the
so-called ``64K'' antibody carries out the attack reponsible for
insulin-dependent diabetes, Atkinson said.
   If that is true, then sabotaging its production early in the
process may keep the disease from developing, he said.
   Scientists may be able to create samples of the protein it
attacks and link it to a poison, he said. If that combination is
injected into a person with the antibody in his blood, it might
encounter and kill the blood cells reponsible for directing the
immune system attack, he said.
   Scientists hope to test that soon in mice, Atkinson said.
   Before such a strategy could be used for humans, researchers
must devise a simpler blood test than they have now to look for the
antibody, he said.
   Besides Atkinson, scientists in the study included Noel
MacLaren, Lynn Holmes and William Riley at the Florida school and
and David Scharp at the Washington University School of Medicine in
St. Louis.

   A powerful storm pounded western
Bangladesh, killing five people, flattening mud huts and leaving
about 5,000 people homeless, police said today.
   About 2,000 homes were destroyed in the storm Monday night in
Kushtia district, about 60 miles west of the capital, police said
by telephone on condition of anonymity.
   About 200 people were injured, most when their houses collapsed.
At least 50 were hospitalized.
   The storm, packing winds of up to 80 mph, lashed the area for
about 30 minutes, uprooting hundreds of trees, toppling utility
polls and damaging rice crops, police said.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Long Day's Journey Into Night' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs with other critics; No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defeated, drug-addled Mary Tyrone has always
been the unhappy heart of ``Long Day's Journey into Night,'' Eugene
O'Neill's harrowing tale of a family trying to come to terms with
its tortured past.
   That aspect of the play never has been made clearer than in the
compelling revival of O'Neill's masterpiece which opened Tuesday at
Broadway's Neil Simon Theater as part of the First New York
International Festival of the Arts.
   The production, directed by Jose Quintero, stars a subdued but
effective Jason Robards as James Tyrone and a haunting Colleen
Dewhurst as his doomed wife, Mary. While Robards is fine as the
parsimonious old matinee idol, it is Dewhurst who holds the play
together and mesmerizes the audience.
   In his introduction to ``Long Day's Journey into Night,''
O'Neill calls the autobiographical drama ``a play of old sorrow.''
Dewhurst personifies that sadness. You can see it the moment she
walks on stage. The woman's face is masked in a tight smile as she
tries to get through what would appear to be just another hot day
at the Tyrone summer cottage in New London, Conn.
   The outward normality of events is shattered by the
unintentional but inevitable return by father, mother and two sons
to events long past. The death of Mary's son Eugene, her addiction
to morphine and the neglect of her youngest child Edmund plunge the
family into a day and night-long battle of recriminations and
halting, painful explanations.
   Dewhurst's performance is never showy. It exudes a patrician
reserve, a sense of correctness that hints at Mary's proper
upbringing in a strict Catholic household. This propriety makes her
final breakdown all the more poignant. She turns into a lady trying
to hold on to her last bit of dignity as the real world slips away.
   Robards has tamed the blarney that sometimes obscures Tyrone's
soul. He exhibits little of the hamminess that Jack Lemmon brought
to the part in the revival New York saw two years ago.
   He takes his time getting into character, bringing Tyrone slowly
into focus. The portrait crystallizes in the play's final act
during the father's long, rambling explanation of his
poverty-stricken youth when he ``learned to be a miser.'' It is a
beautiful, quiet moment, one of the most moving in Quintero's
production.
   The revival is at its heart-breaking best during these
revelations of the past. In them, O'Neill doesn't exonerate his
characters, but instead offers the audience some explanation for
their actions as flawed human beings.
   The understanding also comes through in this production's
portrayals of the two sons. A ruddy-faced Jamey Sheridan captures
the frustration of the cynical older son, drawn like his father to
drink and bitter about the certainty that his life will not amount
to much. Campbell Scott is equally impressive as the sickly Edmund,
torn between love and rage for his parents.
   Jane Macfie delivers an effective cameo as the Irish maid
Cathleen. She resists the temptation to turn the woman into the
usual cartoon stereotype.
   The evocative living room designed by Ben Edwards resembles the
real O'Neill summer home with a panoramic view of Long Island Sound
that darkens as the day turns into a long night.
   What makes ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' special is the
completeness of its characters, real people who are painted with
unflinching honesty. Quintero has made sure that completeness comes
through on stage and with the assistance of an exceptional group of
actors, particularly Dewhurst, turned the evening into a memorable
journey.
   In other reviews:
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post called the production
``O'Neill as O'Neill should be. ... Here is American classic
theater at its greatest, and dealing with an indisputable American
classic.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel wrote, ``Strikingly mounted,
the play moves naturally and effortlessly. ... A work that can seem
labored and elephantine here soars and dips, like a lark wounded
but unable to stop singing.''
   Frank Rich of The New York Times called the production
``rewarding, if imperfect. ... But the evening is never less than
essential theatergoing.''
   He adds, ``One cannot assume that there will be another chance
to watch these three great theater artists (Quintero, Robards and
Dewhurst) explore the writer who has been their consuming passion
for virtually their entire professional careers.''

<HEAD>Stocks At New Highs, Dollar Surges on U.S. Trade Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices reached a new high on the Tokyo stock
market Wednesday, and the U.S. dollar soared against the Japanese
yen on news of better-than-expected U.S. trade figures.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished a day
of brisk trading at a record 28,093.52 points, up 31.72 points or
0.11 percent from Tuesday's close.
   The Nikkei index, the Tokyo market's main barometer, reached its
previous high last Thursday, when it closed at 28,072.02.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar opened at
126.36 yen and ranged between 126.10 and 126.55 yen before closing
at 126.32, up 1.27 yen from Tuesday's finish.
   It was the dollar's highest closing figure since April 13, when
it finished at 126.45.
   ``The largest factor behind the dollar's rise was the
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit in April,'' said an exchange
dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the U.S.
trade deficit narrowed in April to $9.89 billion, its lowest level
since December 1984.
   ``U.S. trade figures always affect world financial markets,
including that in Tokyo,'' said another exchange dealer.

<HEAD>Arab-American Vows To Return To Israel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arab-American expelled from Israel amid
charges of sedition reiterated his intention to convert to Judaism
to gain re-entry to his homeland, but liberal rabbis said political
motivations are not enough reason for conversion.
   Mubarak Awad, who advocates non-violent Palestinian resistance
to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, said
Tuesday he would convert from Christianity to Judaism and seek
re-entry under Israel's Law of the Return ``if everything (else)
failed.''
   Awad is a U.S. citizen who was born in Jerusalem, where he has a
home. He was deported Monday by Israel, which accused him of
playing a key role in the Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories.
   ``I am here, but not by choice,'' he said at a news conference
arranged by the National Council of Churches. ``I was deported just
because I am a Christian. If I were a Jew, I would not be
deported.''
   Under the Law of the Return, Jews may claim Israeli citizenship.
But the privilege is not absolute; gangster Meyer Lansky, for
example, sought Israeli citizenship in 1970 but was forced to leave
two years later after allegations of his continued involvement in
organized crime.
   Pressed on the subject of conversion, which he mentioned during
his deportation battle, Awad said, ``I'll tell (a rabbi) frankly
... it's not my belief (that spurred the request). It's a political
statement that I'm persecuted because I'm a Christian.''
   Leaders of Reform Judaism on Tuesday issued a letter to 1,500
rabbis of the movement in the United States and Canada urging them
not to accommodate Awad should he seek conversion.
   ``No one can rule out the possibility of a sincere conversion in
anybody's case, but this must be proved at the end of a long period
of instruction,'' said the letter. ``Surely we need not remind you
that extraneous motivations, political motivations, are not
sufficient reason.''
   Awad said he would first pursue other avenues, including an
appeal to international public opinion. He said he planned meetings
with officials at the United Nations and in Washington, Europe, and
the Soviet Union.
   He defended his support of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, but said he did not back all the organization's
actions. ``I condemn violence from the PLO, from Israelis, from
everybody,'' he said.
   Awad said he advocated the cutting of electrical wires to
prevent Israeli settlements from being established in Arab areas,
but not in cases where settlements already existed. He also said he
opposed stone throwing, setting forest fires and other violent
tactics some Palestinians have used.
   Some tactics he has long advocated, such as tax boycotts and
commercial strikes, were adopted by leaders of the uprising in the
territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Awad, the 21st Arab expelled by Israel since the uprising began
Dec. 8, was deported on the ground that his three-month tourist
visa, issued when he entered Israel in August, had expired. The
Israelis refused to extend the visa, and the Israeli Supreme Court
last week rejected Awad's appeal to remain.
   Awad lived in the United States for 13 years before returning to
Jerusalem in 1983, and still owns a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio. He is
the founder of the Palestinian Center for the Study of Non-Violence
in Jerusalem. His wife, Nancy Nye, an American, said she soon will
return to Jerusalem to resume her job as principal of a Quaker
school.

<HEAD>Early Step Reported For Treatment of Inherited Cholesterol Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have corrected malfunctioning liver
cells from a rabbit by implanting a human gene, a first step toward
possible cure of a disease that can give children heart attacks.
   The gene made the cells manufacture more protein structures
called receptors that absorb cholesterol from the bloodstream.
   In humans, a deficiency in the receptor supply leads to familial
hypercholesterolemia, an inherited disease that causes heart
attacks by leaving too much cholesterol in the bloodstream.
   The milder form of the disease affects about one in 500 people,
and can be treated with diet and medication.
   But one in a million people are born without the ability to make
any receptors, and they often suffer heart attacks in early
childhood. Some have been treated successfully with transplants of
the liver, which contains most of the body's receptors.
   The new test-tube work is reported in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences by James Wilson and Richard Mulligan
of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the biology
department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and David
Johnston and Douglas Jefferson of the Tufts-New England Medical
Center in Boston.
   They worked with liver cells from rabbits that showed a
deficiency in receptors for low-density cholesterol, called LDL. A
virus was used to carry the human gene that oversees production of
LDL receptors into the rabbit cells.
   One group of cells that took up the gene later showed four to
five times the normal number of receptors. That overabundance may
help reduce the number of liver cells that would have to be
transplanted back into a human patient after treatment in the
laboratory, researchers said.
   The next research step will be to make the altered cells work
stably when placed in rabbits, researchers said.
   But before such an approach could provide long-term cure in
humans for this or other inherited liver diseases, scientists must
find better ways to transplant liver cells, they said. In the long
run, finding ways to plant the receptor gene directly into the
liver of a patient may work better, they said.

<HEAD>Legislature Enacts Nation's 1st Law To Regulate Terminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first law designed to
protect workers from eyestrain and other complaints associated with
long-term use of computer terminals could serve as a model for
other measures, proponents say.
   ``There's no doubt that this will greatly encourage many labor
groups to put this on the top of their legislative agendas,'' said
Louis Slesin, editor of VDT News, a New York-based industry
newsletter that estimates 15 million workers use computers
nationwide.
   The law was enacted Tuesday by a 13-5 vote of the 18-member
Suffolk County Legislature, one vote more than was needed to
override County Executive Patrick Halpin's veto. Halpin had
predicted the measure would turn business away.
   ``Opposition to this bill was based on overreaction,'' said
legislator Gregory Blass. ``We've heard the doom and gloom from
business in the past,'' when bottle-deposit and anti-smoking bills
were enacted.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Jan Pierce, vice president of
Communications Workers of America, which supported the measure.
``The Legislature stood up to big business and held its ground.''
   AFL-CIO officials said they would work to enact similar
legislation in Erie, Albany and Rockland counties, where they said
government leaders have been sympathetic to worker-protection laws.
   Statewide legislation is pending in at least six states,
including New York and Connecticut.
   Under the law, in six months businesses in the Long Island
county with more than 20 visual display terminals will have to
provide special treatment for workers who spend more than 26 hours
a week in front of the computer screens:
   The workers must have 15-minute breaks or a new work assignment
after three hours with a video display terminal.
   The employer must pay 80 percent of the cost of annual eye exams
and any eyeglasses that are needed.
   In addition, any equipment purchased after next year must have
such features as non-glare screens, adjustable desks and
five-legged chairs.
   The bill was written in response to worker complaints of
eyestrain, muscle aches and other ill effects from long-term VDT
use.
   However, Halpin predicted after the vote that the law ``will
cost Suffolk many good high tech jobs.'' He vowed to try ``to
implement the law so it will have minimal impact on the business
community.''
   James LaRocca, president of the Long Island Association, a
business group, predicted the loss of more than 3,000 jobs in
pending expansion and relocation deals.
   ``We're definitely not expanding into Suffolk,'' said Thomas J.
Calabrese, general manager of Long Island customer service for New
York Telephone, which employs 2,000 terminal operators in the
county.

   Police have fired 275,826 rounds of
tear gas to block demonstrations and violent protests so far this
year, up 48 percent compared to the same period last year, a Seoul
newspaper reported today.
   The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper, quoting police statistics, said
demonstrations this year were more violent, causing police to use
$7.53 million worth of tear gas this year as of June 10.
   South Korea produces tear gas, with much of the needed raw
materials coming from the United States, Taiwan and other foreign
countries.
   The paper said police fired 15,875 rounds of tear gas last
Friday to block thousands of radical students trying to march to
the North Korean border for talks with North Korean students on
reunifying the Korean peninsula.

<TEXT>
   About 8,000 people escorted the body
of Ferdinand Marcos' mother, dead more than 40 days, to the
outskirts of Manila today in a show of support for the exiled
former president.
   It was the kickoff for a two-day motorcade to Marcos' home
province of Ilocos Norte, where Josefa Edralin-Marcos is to be
buried at an undetermined date.
   Thousands of onlookers lined an eight-mile route as the Marcos
loyalists marched from Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' suburban home to a
highway on the border of the capital. Many of the onlookers cheered
the marchers on, some heckled them, but most just watched silently.
   Dozens of cars and other vehicles that joined the cortege honked
their horns as marchers, some holding red balloons, rhythmically
blew whistles. Close to the hearse, a woman recited the Rosary
through a loudspeaker mounted on a jeep, but another loudspeaker
blaring a nationalist song drowned her out.
   The marchers shouted slogans describing President Cory Aquino as
``stupid and corrupt.'' Mrs. Aquino, citing security reasons, has
refused to allow Marcos to return to the country to attend the
funeral of his mother, who died May 4 at the age of 95.
   Marcos has lived in Honolulu since he fled the country during
the February 1986 civilian-military revolt that ended his 20-year
rule and swept Mrs. Aquino to power. Mrs. Aquino is on a six-day
trip to Switzerland and Italy.
   The loyalists distributed mimeographed statements eulogizing
Mrs. Edralin-Marcos as a ``great mother ... who served as the light
and teacher of her great son, Ferdinand Marcos.''
   It accused Mrs. Aquino of destroying Philippine tradition and
violating the commandment to love one's parents by not allowing
Marcos to return.

   The mother of an Air Force officer killed in
Vietnam 22 years ago said she would remove the MIA bracelet with
her son's name but wear one with the name of another missing
serviceman now that his remains are home.
   The family of Lt. Col. Vincent Chiarello tearfully accepted his
remains at Philadelphia International Airport on Tuesday and vowed
to continue to work for other families with relatives missing in
Vietnam.
   Anne Chiarello, the officer's mother, broke down during a
service performed by an honor guard. Later, during a news
conference, she said she will take off the MIA bracelet engraved
with her son's name that she has worn since 1978.
   ``I will be happy to wear one for another MIA until he comes
home,'' she said.
   ``I will stay in the National League until the very end,'' Mrs.
Chiarello said, referring to the organization working for
information about all Americans missing in Vietnam.
   ``The 22-year nightmare is over,'' said Joseph Chiarello,
brother of the Air Force intelligence officer.
   Chiarello's plane was shot down near the Laotian border over
North Vietnam on July 29, 1966, according to his sister Joanne
Cornell.
   About four months ago, the Air Force told the family the
Vietnamese government was returning the remains of 20 American
soldiers, including Chiarello's.
   However, on March 3, the remains of only 17 soldiers were
returned along with identification cards for Chiarello and two
others.
   Tom Engkilterra, a coordinator with the National League, said at
the time the remains returned to the United States, only four or
five soldiers had been identified.
   Identification of Chiarello finally came through an exhaustive
study of the remains and comparisons with dental, military and
family records.
   ``The findings were so definite,'' said Mrs. Cornell. ``We felt
we must accept this. We feel beyond a shadow of a doubt these are
my brother's remains.''
   Chiarello's relatives said they will try to help other families
with missing loved ones.
   ``We beseech the Vietnamese government ... to act expeditiously
on behalf of all these families,'' Joseph Chiarello said.
   Engkilterra said there were ``2,400 stories out there that need
to be told so this doesn't become a one-day event.''
   When the family learned that Vincent's remains were to be
returned, they received a tremendous amount of ``loving concern and
support'' from relatives and friends, including Vincent's friends
from college, Mrs. Cornell said.
   ``The outpouring has been so warm and wonderful,'' she said.
   About the time the family learned the remains would be returned,
the Vietnamese released findings of an investigation that concluded
the plane exploded in the air and the bodies fell to the ground
between two villages, Phuc San and Dong Bang, about 20 miles
southwest of Hanoi.
   The family will attend a Mass at Saint Bede's Catholic Church in
suburban Holland on Saturday. Later that day, the officer will be
buried at the Newtown Cemetery in Newtown.

<TEXT>
   A woman sued rock 'n' roll star Chuck Berry for
$5 million, saying he punched her in the face, causing severe
physical and emotional injuries.
   Marilyn O'Brian Boteler said Berry, 62, struck her in the face
on Dec. 18 in the Gramercy Park Hotel. She said in a police
complaint that the punch caused a cut that required five stitches
inside her mouth.
   Ms. Boteler, who is in her 30s and lives in New York City,
appeared at the trial-level state Supreme Court building in
Manhattan with her lawyer to file the suit Tuesday. She would not
say whether she had dated Berry and refused to say why she and
Berry had a dispute. She also refused to say what she does for a
living.
   Berry's lawyer, William Krasilovsky, declined to comment, saying
he had not seen the documents.
   Berry, of Wentzville, Mo., failed to surrender as scheduled on
June 5 to answer the misdemeanor assault complaint charging he hit
Ms. Boteler.
   Police Officer Max Polster, who was to arrest Berry, said he
believed the musician failed to show up because of a
misunderstanding between him and his lawyer. Polster said he
believed a new surrender date was being fixed.
   Berry, who wrote and recorded the rock 'n' roll classics
``Johnny B. Goode'' and ``Roll Over Beethoven,'' could face up to a
year in jail if convicted on the misdemeanor assault charge.

<HEAD>Scholars Criticize New Edition of `Ulysses'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Random House is considering withdrawing the new
edition of James Joyce's novel ``Ulysses,'' because of criticism
from scholars who say the corrected edition is more seriously
flawed than its predecessors.
   ``We're going to leave it to ... a group of experts to advise
us,'' said Jason Epstein, editorial director of Random House. ``But
I'm inclined to think that the edition we're publishing now is
seriously flawed.''
   No single comprehensive manuscript of ``Ulysses'' exists. The
novel, first published in Paris in 1922, was written during a
seven-year period in longhand that is often illegible. Joyce then
added 100,000 words to the page proofs.
   To further complicate matters, the book was typeset by hand by
French printers who did not speak English.
   A team of German scholars produced the new edition two years
ago, saying it corrected about 5,000 omissions, transpositions and
other errors in previous editions.
   At the time, scholars and critics hailed the new edition as a
landmark of textual scholarship and it replaced earlier editions in
classrooms and most of the nation's bookstores.
   John Kidd, of the University of Virginia, is leading the
criticism of the new version, known as the Gabler edition after its
principal editor, Hans Walter Gabler of the University of Munich.
   Among Kidd's complaints are assertions that the edition is the
18th edition, rather than the 11th; that the version is not a
purified text of Joyce's conceptions; that the researchers relied
on facsimiles of manuscripts, making it impossible to separate
Joyce's work from that of his assistants and printers; and that
some of the changes made are ``patently un-Joycean,'' thus
endangering the fabric of one of the most acclaimed novels in the
English language.
   Kidd makes his arguments in ``The Scandal of `Ulysses,' '' an
article appearing in the June 30 issue of The New York Review of
Books.
   Gabler disputed or denied all of Kidd's charges, although he
said he had not seen the article.
   He said that while ``the charges sound damaging,'' he has heard
them before and that they usually dissolve ``into thin air.''

<TEXT>
   A retired Indian navy officer was arrested
trying to smuggle classified papers onto a New York-bound flight,
police said today.
   The Indian Express newspaper said the papers involved India's
top-secret efforts to produce a nuclear-powered submarine, a
project reportedly shelved when India leased a nuclear-powered
submarine from the Soviet Union.
   Bombay Police Commissioner V.K. Saras declined to give any
details of the documents, but said the ex-officer was arrested May
30 at Bombay's Sahar International Airport.
   The Indian Express identified the officer as retired Capt. B.K.
Subba Rao. Bombay police sources confirmed his surname is Subba
Rao, but said they were unsure of his rank and first name.
   Subba Rao appeared in a Bombay court Tuesday and was remanded to
police custody for 14 days under the Official Secrets Act, the
police sources said.
   Under the Indian judicial system, suspects can be held without
charge pending the completion of investigations.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to
give any details of the proceedings. The interim hearing was not
open to the public, and court windows were sealed while Subba Rao
was in the room.
   None of the sources gave any indication of the intended
recipients of the documents.
   A U.S. Embassy official in New Delhi, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``It would be inappropriate for us to comment.''
He would not elaborate.
   The Indian Express, a nationally circulated English-language
daily, said Subba Rao had been closely associated with the
submarine project from its start in the 1970s.
   He later became involved in a dispute with the Bhabha Atomic
Research Center over the project, which was shelved when India
acquired a nuclear-powered submarine from the Soviet Union earlier
this year, the newspaper said.
   Failing to persuade the Indian government to go ahead with plans
to make its own nuclear-powered submarine, Subba Rao then sought to
sell the plans to a foreign country, the Indian Express said.
   In 1985 four Indian men, including two retired air force
officers, were convicted of spying for the United States.
   They were sentenced to 10 years at hard labor after being found
guilty of conspiring with U.S. officials and giving them classified
information about Soviet military equipment, including MiG fighter
planes and T-72 tanks.

<TEXT>
   The apparently successful test-firing
of a version of Morton Thiokol's redesigned solid fuel booster
leaves only one final test before space shuttle flights can resume,
officials say.
   The 122-second test Tuesday at the rocket manufacturer's remote
plant west of here was the fourth of five required to qualify the
redesigned booster before the shuttle program, halted after the
1986 Challenger disaster, can resume.
   Brilliant yellow flame erupted from the 126-foot-long rocket,
the ground trembled and grayish-brown smoke billowed thousands of
feet into the air amid a roar that could be heard for miles.
   ``It's an extremely good test,'' said Royce Mitchell, solid
rocket program manager for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. ``It's a good feeling to have everything looking so
well at this time.''
   J.R. Thompson, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., said the apparent success of the test bodes well
for an August launch of the shuttle Discovery.
   The motor was virtually identical to those that will help power
the Discovery and other shuttles, Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab
said. Unlike the three previous test-firings, the rocket did not
contain any intentional flaws designed to determine whether its
joints can withstand the intense heat and pressures of launch even
in the event of some failures.
   The Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, was blamed on a
booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through
an O-ring, triggering the blast that killed the seven crew members.
   Thiokol plans to conduct the final full-scale test in late July,
with severe flaws introduced in the joints to test the system to
its limits.
   ``We'd rather take the risks in the hills of Utah rather than on
the launch pad,'' Thompson said.
   Tuesday's test was the first conducted on a new $22 million test
stand, which uses hydraulic struts to duplicate steering, flight
turbulence and other stresses the motor will endure during launch,
Raab said.
   Allen McDonald, Thiokol's vice president of engineering, said
preliminary data indicated that the motor successfully withstood
the simulated liftoff and flight stresses, which were ``worst-case
sideloads'' similar to those experienced in past shuttle flights.
   He said engineers will spend two days studying computer readouts
of the test and disassembling the motor, and officials expect to
have a complete analysis within two weeks.
   The new test stand also can heat an entire motor to 110 degrees
Fahrenheit or cool it to 20 degrees. The rocket's 1.1 million
pounds of propellant were heated to a uniform 90 degrees, or about
20 degrees warmer than the usual launch temperature, to allow
engineers to test its performance at the upper limit for an actual
launch, Raab said.
   In late December, a rocket motor and its propellant will be
cooled to about 40 degrees for another test to analyze its
performance at the other end of the spectrum, he said.
   The rocket's three joints also are equipped with heaters to
maintain a minimum temperature of 75 degrees. Freezing temperatures
the night before the doomed Challenger launch were found to have
contributed to the joint failure.
   Officials said the testing has gone so well that Discovery's two
boosters were hooked up Friday with an external fuel tank at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., and the boosters and tank were to be joined with
the shuttle Thursday.

   News of an improvement in the U.S. trade deficit
boosted the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index to a new high in brisk
trading today and strengthened the U.S. dollar against the Japanese
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at a
record 28,093.52 points, up 31.72 or 0.11 percent from Tuesday's
close. The Nikkei index, the market's main barometer, reached its
previous high last Thursday when it closed at 28,072.02.
   Volume on the exchange was a heavy 2.6 billion shares, up
sharply from Tuesday's volume of 930 million.
   ``The latest U.S. trade report promped wide-ranging buying
interest,'' said an official at Nomura Securities Co., Japan's
largest securities company.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the trade
deficit narrowed in April to $9.89 billion, its lowest level since
December 1984.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at
126.36 yen and ranged between 126.10 and 126.55 yen before closing
at 126.32, up 1.27 yen from Tuesday's finish. It was the dollar's
highest closing figure since April 13, when it finished at 126.45.
   A total of $7.729 billion changed hands today, more than three
times the volume Tuesday.
   ``The largest factor behind the dollar's rise was the
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit in April,'' said an exchange
dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two-legged commuters are waiting longer for
Chicago Transit Authority buses because there are too many
six-legged passengers aboard, officials say.
   A cockroach infestation has put another bug in the city's
attempts to control a recent shortage of useable buses, CTA
authorities said Tuesday.
   The insects have been discovered on as many as 40 buses coming
from a major CTA garage and repair center on the South Side,
forcing the agency to send the vehicles back in for insecticide
sprays, officials said.
   Gloria Chevere, the agency's administrative chief, offered one
explanation for the hitchhiking cockroaches: ``There was a lot of
garbage that accumulated that we didn't have Dumpsters for.''
   Richard Winston, the agency's senior manager of bus
maintainence, said recent hot weather also may have been a factor.
   He said there also was a possibility that the standard
insecticide no longer works as well as it used to.
   ``We've started a program of having our technical services
people review the effectiveness of this material, as well as other
commercial products,'' Winston said.
   A lack of replacement parts and delays in structural overhauls
are the main reason for the bus shortage, officials said.
   On Tuesday, 61 bus runs were canceled and 64 other buses ran
late because of a shortage of usable vehicles.

<HEAD>National Bank President Promoted to Politburo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party promoted to the ruling
Politburo the national bank president, a strong advocate of
economic reform who opposes the price increases that fueled last
month's widespread labor unrest.
   In the second shake-up in six months, a Central Committee
meeting on Tuesday also gave key posts to two Politburo members who
have been mentioned as possible successors to Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   The strikes between April 25 and May 10 comprised the country's
worst labor unrest in six years. Jaruzelski, the first party
secretary, has acknowledged that efforts to reform the foundering
economy have been disappointing.
   Wladyslaw Baka, president of the National Bank of Poland, was
elected to the 15-member Politburo in a secret ballot and elected a
member and a secretary of the 230-member Central Committee, which
the Politburo oversees.
   Baka favors economic reform but is known to have spoken against
the across-the-board price increases that were adopted as part of
the reform package.
   Mieczyslaw Rakowski and Foreign Minister Marian Orzechowski, two
Politburo members who could succeed Jaruzelski if he decides to
step down, were given added posts as Central Committee secretaries.
   Rakowski was elected to the Politburo during the last leadership
shake-up on Dec. 15. The former newspaper editor will be in charge
of party propaganda and the media, according to an official source.
   Orzechowski, foreign minister since 1985, has said the adverse
attention given strikes in Poland was undermining the country's
position in the world. He was given charge of the Central
Committee's ideological commission, replacing Henryk Bednarski, who
resigned.
   He was also given the chairmanship of a commission to prepare a
party conference on ideology, tentatively expected early next year.
   Two Politburo members resigned: Marian Wozniak, who had been in
charge of economic policy, and Wlodzimier Mokrzyszczak, who had
been in charge of internal party discipline.
   Stanislaw Ciosek resigned as a Central Committee secretary but
was named an alternate non-voting member of the Politburo. Another
non-voting Politburo member, Stanislaw Bejger, the Gdansk party
chief, resigned. Two previous Central Committee secretaries also
resigned, Jozef Baryla and Tadeusz Porebski.
   Party spokesman Jerzy Majka said at a news conference after the
plenum that the Central Committee urged consultation with groups
that consider themselves independent or opposition.
   But Majka said there could be no dialogue with those he said
want to worsen the domestic situation or are paid by a foreign
power, a reference to the banned trade union Solidarity.
   Jaruzelski said economic reform should be speeded up and that
delays and negligence within the party were partly to blame for the
slow pace of reforms.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A close friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese
III warned Wedtech officials not to boast about the company's
Washington connections, according to a letter read at Rep. Mario
Biaggi's racketeering trial.
   ``The less said about our `clout,' the better,'' said the June
1, 1985, memo from E. Robert Wallach. It was produced Tuesday by
defense attorney Dominic Amorosa, who then cross-examined
ex-Wedtech president Anthony Guariglia about its significance.
   ``The clout he's talking about included Misters Meese, Nofziger,
and Bragg, didn't it?'' asked Amorosa, referring to ex-White House
adviser Lyn Nofziger and Nofziger's consulting partner Mark Bragg.
   ``Yes,'' Guariglia replied. The memo also made mention of the
``special treatment'' Wedtech, a defense contractor, had received
from government agencies, Guariglia said.
   Earlier, Guariglia had testified that in its efforts to
guarantee lucrative government contracts, Wedtech had attempted to
lobby National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane through Wallach.
   The assertions were later denied by McFarlane's attorney.
   ``The person in question is not Robert McFarlane. At no time,
directly or indirectly, was Mr. McFarlane contacted by the Wedtech
company or any of its representatives on Wedtech's behalf,'' said
McFarlane attorney Peter Morgan.
   Amorosa, representing Biaggi's son and co-defendant, Richard,
introduced the memo and several other letters from Wallach during a
contentious cross-examination of Guariglia.
   Wallach is under indictment on federal racketeering charges that
say he took payoffs from Wedtech officials to influence Meese and
other public officials.
   Guariglia and other company officials have testified they paid
$800,000 to Wallach to influence the attorney general. They have
said Wallach told them he got the attorney general to intercede on
the company's behalf for a series of contracts worth $143 million
to build pontoons: floating, portable docks.
   Amorosa, trying to link Wedtech's contracts to the efforts of
Wallach rather than the defendants, quizzed Guariglia about their
relationship _ focusing on an illegal $150,000 payoff for his
lobbying that was funneled through a third party.
   ``He knew you were a crook, and you knew he was a crook,
right?'' the lawyer asked.
   Guariglia paused before answering in a loud voice, ``Yes.''
   The witness is the last of four ex-Wedtech officials who have
pleaded guilty to corruption charges to testify at the trial in
exchange for leniency. Guariglia, 37, has said he faces up to 10
years in prison despite his plea in the case involving the
now-bankrupt company.
   During the cross-examination, Amorosa and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Mary T. Shannon squared off several times in the
sweltering courtroom, with the prosecutor at one point attributing
her anger to the heat.
   Biaggi, his son and the others _ Wedtech founder John Mariotta,
ex-Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, attorney Bernard Ehrlich,
Small Business Administration Regional Administrator Peter Neglia
and Neglia friend Ronald Betsoare _ are accused of converting
Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise for the payment of bribes to
obtain no-bid government contracts.

<HEAD>Greek, Turkish Leaders Agree to Meet Again on Cyprus, Aegean
Conflicts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of Greece and Turkey
failed to resolve conflicts over Cyprus and the Aegean Sea, but
they agreed to meet again to discuss these and other longstanding
disputes.
   Premier Turgut Ozal planned to return to Turkey today after two
days of private talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou at a
heavily guarded seaside hotel.
   They planned to resume their dialogue in the Turkish capital of
Ankara later this year, officials said. No date was set for the
meeting, but Turkish officials said it probably will be held in
October.
   ``Today's climate was positive ... filled with goodwill. All
these types of meetings are a step forward,'' said Greek spokesman
Yiannis Roubatis. Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz said:
``It's useful to continue the dialogue.''
   But a $20 million Greek-Turkish banking agreement due to be
signed on Tuesday was delayed at the last minute, apparently
because of Greek reluctance to be seen making any concessions.
   The agreement for a joint venture between Greece's state-owned
Ionian Bank and Turkey's Housing Bank would have been the first
substantive product of improved Greek-Turkish relations.
   Papandreou and Ozal launched the negotiations at a meeting in
January at the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
   Ten months earlier, Greece and Turkey had come close to war over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean seabed.
   They also have longstanding disputes over Aegean airspace, the
military status of some Greek islands and Greek-owned property in
the Turkish city of Istanbul.
   Ozal said he didn't intend to pull any of the 30,000 Turkish
troops out of the northern sector of the divided Mediterranean
island of Cyprus. He also stuck to his demand for a two-zone
federated state on Cyprus.
   Papandreou wants the Turkish troops out of Cyprus before peace
talks begin. He also links a Cyprus settlement with lifting a Greek
veto on Turkey's application to join the European Economic
Community.
   Cyprus has been divided into northern Turkish Cypriot and
southern Greek Cypriot sectors since Turkish troops invaded in 1974
after an Athens-led coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
   Ozal took a more conciliatory approach to the issue of
Greek-owned assets in Istanbul. He cited a new Turkish government
decree that enables Greek citizens to make investments in Turkey
using funds raised from selling their Istanbul property.
   Many Greeks who formerly lived in Istanbul want to sell their
assets, but they were discouraged by a Turkish ruling that such
funds must remain in blocked bank accounts.
   More than 200,000 Istanbul Greeks left the city when
Greek-Turkish relations deteriorated in the 1950s and 1960s.

<HEAD>Three on Raft Killed After it Overturns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODBRIDGE, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A makeshift raft overturned in a muddy
pond, killing three occupants trapped underwater 30 minutes,
authorities said.
   A fourth person aboard the raft Tuesday was able to free himself
but could not lift the raft off his companions because the pond's
bottom was too muddy, police said.
   Two of the victims, both males, were brought to the Hospital of
St. Raphael in New Haven unconscious and suffering from cardiac
arrest, said Ken Warren, a hospital spokesman. He said men were
pronounced dead shortly before 3 p.m. after doctors tried for a
half hour to resuscitate them.
   Their identities were withheld pending notification of relatives.
   Ruby Roberts, 32, of New Haven, died shortly ater 11 p.m. at
Yale-New Haven Hospital, hospital spokesman Thomas Urtz said.
   The small wood raft had railings around all four sides and
vertical bars, and was kept afloat by metal drums. Police said it
sank in 4 feet of water about 50 feet from the shore of Konolds
Pond, where the four people had gone fishing.
   The fourth person on the raft, Joel Williams of New Haven, tried
unsuccessfully to move the raft, and left to call for help, police
said. When rescuers arrived, they summoned a tow truck to pull the
raft off the three victims.
   Police estimated the victims had been under water 30 to 35
minutes.
   Police said they did not know who owned the raft.

<HEAD>Leningrad Theater Troupe to Perform on American Stage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The show will go on, albeit a different one, for
the 23 members of the Maly Theater of Leningrad whose status on the
American stage had remained up in the air until now.
   ``Stars of the Morning Sky'' will run for 16 performances at the
American Place Theater beginning Monday or Tuesday, according to
producer Ken Marsolais.
   Until last week, the troupe had been scheduled to present a
two-evening, seven-hour play called ``Brothers and Sisters'' as
part of the First New York International Festival of the Arts.
   The production was abruptly canceled because Marsolais was not
able to raise $100,000 of the $450,000 needed, said Martin E.
Segal, festival chairman.
   The troupe had been staging ``Stars of the Morning Sky'' in
Toronto. When the run ended, members flew to New York, but 37
members of the company who were to have flown to New York from
Leningrad for ``Brothers and Sisters'' remained in the Soviet
Union. Plans to bring over the remaining troupe members were
scrapped along with the production.
   Lev Dodin, director of the Maly Theater, said he feels
``bitterness about something that was to have happened but hasn't.''
   The funds raised for ``Brothers and Sisters'' will be used
instead to produce ``Stars of the Morning Sky,'' Marsolais said
Tuesday.

   Hundreds of radical students
protesting compulsory military training fought riot police with
firebombs and rocks today after troopers moved in to break up the
protest.
   Fierce fighting erupted at Chungang University in Seoul when
lines of riot police in green combat fatigues and black visored
helmets marched onto the campus firing volleys of tear gas.
   Masked students hurled firebombs that exploded in showers of
flaming gasoline and pelted police with rocks and broken bricks.
Troopers behind riot shields fired choking tear gas and hurled
rocks back at the radicals.
   ``Boycott military training'' and ``Yankee go home,'' students
yelled as they battled police for several hours.
   Several students were hit by tear gas shells, but no serious
injuries were reported.
   Radical students also clashed with riot police at a college in
the central city of Taejon to protest a government ban on a radical
march to the communist North Korean border last week. Police drove
students off with tear gas.
   About 10 radical students staged a dawn attack today with
firebombs on an office of the governing Democratic Justice Party in
Seoul, police said. The students hurled firebombs at the
fifth-floor office from the street, but missed.
   South Korea has been hit during the past month by a wave of
violent protests by radical students who demand the overthrow of
the government and reunification of the divided Korean peninsula.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on college campuses,
have failed to attract public support.
   About 1,000 radical students from five Seoul colleges gathered
at Chungang today to demand an end to compulsory military training
for college students. They were preparing to march into the street
when police moved onto the campus to block the radicals.
   Radical leaders denounced the government of President Roh
Tae-woo and the United States and said military training was
``preparation of machinery for the Yankees.''
   Student speakers at a rally before the clash demanded an end to
military training and the expulsion of the 42,000 U.S. troops based
in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   All male college students in South Korea are required to undergo
weekly military training along with periodic instruction sessions
at military barracks. Radicals say the training is part of a
military conspiracy to create tension with the north.
   Radical students want immediate reunification of the Korean
peninsula, divided since the end of World War II. They contend that
the United States enforces partition to rule the south as a colony.
   Major street clashes erupted in Seoul last Friday when riot
police blocked thousands of radical students trying to march to the
border for talks with North Korean students on reunifying the
peninsula.
   The two Koreas are bitter enemies. The north invaded the south
in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<HEAD>Teacher-Scout Leader Sentenced to Life for Fondling 16 Boys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 42-year-old former teacher of the year was
sentenced to life in prison for fondling as many as 16 boys.
   District Judge John Ovard issued the sentence Tuesday at a
jury's recommendation.
   The jury took 90 minutes to decide that John Earl McGrew, a Boy
Scout leader, should serve a life term on one count of aggravated
sexual assault of a child and 20 years each on two counts of
indecency with a child.
   He also was fined $5,000 on each count. The prison sentences,
the maximum in each case, will run concurrently.
   McGrew, who was convicted Monday following a three-week trial,
said he will appeal.
   ``I am innocent of this crime and I will be moving to the next
step to prove my innocence,'' McGrew said at a news conference
after the sentencing.
   Defense attorney John Weddle had asked jurors to place McGrew on
probation, citing his numerous awards for work with the Boy Scouts
and his selection as his elementary school's 1986 teacher of the
year.
   McGrew claims he was the victim of a conspiracy, but would not
elaborate.
   Prosecutor Faith Johnson said Johnson was ``a typical fixated
pedophile and he doesn't want to admit he's guilty.''
   McGrew, who taught at John J. Rhoads Elementary School in south
Dallas, was arrested in December after an 11-year-old former pupil
said the teacher fondled him in the classroom in the fall of 1984.
   In addition to the three complaining witnesses, 13 other
children testified that McGrew fondled them. Eight children
testifying on behalf of McGrew said he never touched them.

<TEXT>
   Tennis ball machines would be relegated
to the status of lawn mowers and bulldozers under a noise ordinance
tentatively approved in this posh community that once tried to ban
men from running topless.
   The ordinance approved Tuesday by the Town Council would limit
use of the electric servers to the same weekday hours set aside for
heavy construction _ 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. between Dec. 1 and April 3
and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. the remainder of the year. Unlike heavy
machinery, however, the council would allow tennis ball machines to
be used on weekends.
   The ball machines were lumped into a category of equipment
``that may be obnoxious during certain hours,'' said town attorney
John Randolph.
   Town officials had considered banning new ball machines from the
island, where the ordinance prohibiting men from topless jogging
was struck down in March by an appeals court. The community also
was lampooned by Garry Trudeau in his ``Doonesbury'' comic strip
for a law requiring workers to carry identification cards. That law
was declared unconstitutional, so the council in March made it
voluntary for employers to require workers to have the cards.
   Some proponents of the tennis ball machine ordinance also wanted
to prohibit their use on weekends.
   The proposed regulations would be enforced only if there are
complaints from neighbors, town officials said. The maximum fine
for a noise violation is $250 a day.
   One resident who attended the council meeting questioned why
ball machines were singled out and cited driveway basketball games
as a greater disturbance to the peace.
   ``This goes into the delicate area of private recreational
uses,'' Adrian Winterfield said. ``I suggest it is unnecessary to
include a prohibition against one activity, because if the noise is
excessive ... it can be regulated on that basis.''
   The council will make its final decision on the ordinance next
month.

<HEAD>Tobacco Suit Verdict Reverberates throughout Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lead attorney in a landmark cigarette
liability suit said his partial victory leaves tobacco companies
open to racketeering charges, but industry lawyers gleaned another
message: If you puff, you pay.
   Those were two of the reactions Tuesday as the verdict in the
case of Antonio Cipollone, who on Monday won the first judgment
against a tobacco company in 30 years, continued to reverberate
throughout the industry.
   Tobacco companies went on the offensive, holding a news
conference to attack the fairness of the judge in the 4{-month
case. Meanwhile, stock prices dipped even though analysts played
down long-term effects of the verdict.
   In a separate decision Tuesday, a federal appeals court rejected
a couple's $107 million claim against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
ruling that warning labels on cigarette packages are sufficient to
inform people about the dangers of smoking.
   Monday's landmark verdict found that Liggett Group Inc. failed
to warn the public about smoking's dangers before labels were
required in 1966 and granted damages for violating a promise, or
``express warranty,'' in advertisements that cigarettes were safe.
   Plaintiffs, who were awarded $400,000, were able to claim at
least a partial victory for the first time in 30 years of cigarette
liability lawsuits.
   However, the U.S. District Court jury in Newark cleared Liggett
and two other cigarette-makers, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris
Inc., of conspiring to mislead the public about the risks of
smoking.
   No punitive damages were awarded in the case brought by
Cipollone and his wife, Rose, who was 58 when she died of lung
cancer in 1984 after smoking cigarettes made by the three companies
for 40 years.
   The jury mostly blamed Mrs. Cipollone for contracting her
disease.
   Even so, Marc Z. Edell, the lead attorney for Cipollone, said
Tuesday the case suggested how to improve the chances of winning a
judgment on a broader, more damaging conspiracy charge: charging
the companies with a civil claim under the Racketeer-Influenced
Corrupt Organization statute.
   The federal statute says a company can be found liable if it is
found to be an enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering
activity.
   A jury that focused more on a pattern of acts would lessen the
plaintiff's burden to show the smoker's own behavior contributed to
the disease, Edell told a news conference.
   In a separate news conference in New York, tobacco company
lawyers said they regarded the verdict as fundamentally a victory
because it reinforced the industry's defense _ that Mrs. Cipollone
made a decision to smoke knowing the risks.
   ``The jury returned a resounding message that individuals who
make informed choices have responsibility for those choices,'' said
Philip Morris' general counsel, Murray Bring.
   Tobacco company lawyers also attacked the fairness of Judge H.
Lee Sarokin and released a detailed rebuttal of previously secret
industry documents introduced by anti-smoking forces during the
trial.
   ``It is clear from any person looking at his rulings that they
were preferential and unwarranted'' and against the rules of
procedure, Stevens said of the judge. ``We could not have had a
more extreme adversary.''
   Sarokin's law clerk said the judge would not comment because the
case was still pending before him.
   Edell said the companies claimed victory for public relations
reasons, to encourage industry investors and discourage other
lawyers from pursuing such cases.
   Liggett attorneys have promised an appeal of the damages award.
   Tobacco stocks dropped Tuesday with Liggett Group falling 50
cents a share to $7.62{.
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the nation's biggest tobacco company,
fell $1.75 to $83.25 and Loews Corp., parent of Lorillard, slipped
25 cents to $65.12{.
   RJR Nabisco Inc. dropped $1 to $47 and American Brands Inc. rose
25 cents to $45.12{. RJR Nabisco and American Brands were not party
to the suit.
   But analysts expected a recovery after an initial slump.
   ``We think it's a victory for the industry,'' said Kurt A.
Feuerman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``It's a shot in the arm
for anti-tobacco forces, but it's largely symbolic.''

<HEAD>CBS News Stars Highlight Final Day Of Conference By No. 3 Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anchorman Dan Rather and other CBS news
personalities showed up to bolster executives' spirits at a
sometimes angry affiliates meeting, as word came that the No. 3
network plans to revamp its ``eye'' logo.
   The convention for the network's 206 affiliates, which ended
Tuesday, featured some harsh closed-door attacks on the string of
scheduling failures that mired CBS in third place this past season,
behind No. 1 NBC and No. 2 ABC.
   It was the first last-place finish among the big three networks
in CBS' history.
   ``This has not been a polite conference,'' said Howard Stringer,
president of CBS News.
   Meanwhile, CBS said it would unveil a new ``state of the art''
version of its trademark CBS ``eye'' logo along with new theme
music to identify the network, according to a story published in
today's editions of The Washington Post.
   The Post quoted the network, in a statement issued at the
affiliates' meeting, as saying the ``new, contemporary CBS logo
(is) designed to appeal to younger viewers while still pleasing
current viewers.''
   The network said the new logo and music could premiere by July
4, but that no definite date has been set, according to the Post.
   Amid complaints from worried station chiefs of a lack of focus,
CBS also said at the meeting it will launch a campaign to promote
Rather and its news correspondents and begin using cable to sell
itself in promotional spots.
   CBS President Laurence Tisch and CBS Broadcast Group President
Gene Jankowski said during the conference that poor promotion has
hurt CBS.
   ``We didn't do a good job,'' Tisch said of previous promotional
efforts.
   Rather, who was greeted with extended applause, introduced
several of the network's best-known journalists.
   ``I bring you warm welcomes from the men and women of CBS
News,'' Rather told the affiliates. ``I'm proud to be here with all
of you and I'm proud of all of you.''
   Others at the conference Tuesday were Harry K. Smith, Kathleen
Sullivan, Leslie Stahl, Ed Bradley, Diane Sawyer and Meredith
Vieira. They all took a turn onstage as their various news programs
were presented along with plans to improve them.
   Stringer introduced the journalists by noting that Rather and
the ``CBS Evening News'' won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings war last
week, snapping a six-week run by ``ABC World News Tonight,''
anchored by Peter Jennings.
   The enthusiastic reaction to Rather contrasted with some
sentiments expressed at earlier meetings when station chiefs
complained about Rather's combative interview with Vice President
George Bush in January and his angry departure from the set of the
``CBS Evening News'' in August.
   Meanwhile, the news promos unveiled showed such things as Rather
in the field covering a flood, on the front line in Vietnam, in
Moscow, India, Cuba and elsewhere.
   ``Before Dan Rather went to the front desk, he went to the front
line,'' the ad announcer said.
   The promos were scheduled to begin airing today.

   Presbyterians paused to clap and pray after
adopting a statement on ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,''
then called early today to restudy the church's pro-choice abortion
stance before ending a marathon meeting.
   Tuesday's session at the 200th General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) began with the election of a top
church officer and ended shortly before 2 a.m. after the assembly
voted 250-244 to initiate a new study on abortion.
   Anti-abortion groups in the 3-million-member church have sought
a new study since 1985, when the denomination adopted a statement
condemning abortion as a method of birth control but concluding
that the decision remains a private one between a woman, her
physician and her conscience.
   The assembly was to adjourn today after discussing
denominational finances and the location of the headquarters of the
denomination's pension board.
   The commissioners overwhelmingly accepted the Christian
Obedience report, prompting spontaneous applause in the Cervantes
Convention Center, where the delegates, called commissioners, have
been meeting since June 7.
   The report was the result of a process begun in 1983 when
congregations asked how to respond to those who refuse to pay taxes
over disagreement with government action.
   The paper responded that their decision should be recognized as
proper ``under certain circumstances,'' and they they should be
given emotional support by the church.
   Committee revisions of the paper changed language to make it
clear ``it is normally the case'' that Christians obey civil
authority.
   A request was left in, however, that church agencies set up a
Fund for Obedience to Higher Authority ``for the assistance of
those who suffer financial loss or difficulty as result of acts of
conscience.''
   The paper says nuclear war is immoral, and that nuclear
deterrence ``as an adequate, permanent means to national security
... is not morally defensible.''
   Language added by a committee at the assembly states that
military service is ``a legitimate function of civil government
(and) many Presbyterians have decided that obedience to God leads
them to participate in the military.''
   Remaining on today's agenda was a recommendation to consolidate
the denomination's pension fund in Philadelphia, headquarters of
the pension board in the United Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) the
larger of two denominations that merged in 1983 to end a 121-year
division.
   Commissioners will consider a minority report that recommends
the pension board move to Atlanta, site of the headquarters of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.), the smaller, Southern church in the
union.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Rev. James E. Andrews was re-elected to a
second four-year term as stated clerk, or the denomination's chief
constitutional office. By a 323-298 vote he defeated Harriet
Nelson, 54, a lay leader from Napa, Calif.
   Andrews, 59, had to be nominated from the floor after a
nominating committee rejected his nomination to the $62,000-a-year
post.
   Andrews told commissioners he had been ``sent a message'' by the
narrow margin to heal the divisions in the denomination stemming
from the merger.
   Conservatives within the denomination have blamed declining
membership on what they perceive to be increasingly liberal stances
by the church under Andrews.
   In nominating Mrs. Nelson, the Rev. J. Randolph Taylor called
Andrews ``a reminder of our divided past'' and said the ``church
needs a sense of newness.''
   Andrews, who was stated clerk of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.)
from 1973 to 1983, promised to be ``very active in ... bringing in
various viewpoints, various factions together in a denomination
that's growing up.''
   The stated clerk represents the church in ecumenical bodies,
oversees the annual assembly and heads a staff of 65 with a budget
of about $7 million.
   In other action, the assembly recommended a higher federal
minimum wage and called for a national dialogue on the status of
Americans Indians. It also considered suggested actions on health
costs and religious freedom.
   The assembly adopted a lengthy paper on pornography that
concludes its fundamental cause is sexism. The recommendations
reiterate the church's call for the enactment of the Equal Rights
Amendment and direct church officials to develop a public policy
statement on pornography.

   Drug-related AIDS cases are
increasingly linked to cocaine rather than heroin, and crack users
who trade sex for drugs may be spreading the epidemic further, a
researcher said today.
   Drug-related AIDS also is spreading to parts of the developing
world where illicit drug shipments originate, said Don Des Jarlais
of the New York State Division of Substance Abuse Services in New
York City. He spoke at the Fourth International Conference on AIDS.
   The reason for the growing link between AIDS and cocaine
injection may be partly due to the frequency with which cocaine
users inject themselves, Des Jarlais said.
   Heroin users may inject themselves three or four times per day,
Des Jarlais said. But cocaine users may inject themselves as often
as every 15 minutes until their cocaine supply is exhausted, he
said.
   ``That can lead to almost continuous sharing of drug injection
equipment and a much greater likelihood of viral transmission,'' he
said.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact.
   Various reports at the AIDS conference have identified the
sharing of needles by drug abusers as one of the most rapidly
growing components of the AIDS epidemic.
   The disease also can be spread in transfusions of tainted blood
or blood products and from mother to child at or before birth.
   Crack users do not inject the drug, but the trading of sex for
drugs could be further spreading AIDS infection among the
drug-abusing population, Des Jarlais said.
   The spread of AIDS among cocaine abusers, which Des Jarlais has
observed in New York City and San Francisco, is also of concern
because of the difficulty of treating cocaine addiction, Des
Jarlais said.
   ``We currently lack any large-scale treatment for cocaine
dependence,'' he said. Heroin addiction can be controlled by
substituting methadone for the drug, but there is no such
substitute for cocaine.
   As of June 6, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had reports
of 64,506 cases of AIDS, 11,914 of which, or 18 percent, were among
non-homosexual intravenous drug abusers.
   Des Jarlais said the spread of AIDS among drug abusers appears
to be slowing. In San Francisco, 15 percent to 20 percent of
cocaine and heroin abusers have been infected with the virus, but
that figure has not increased for about 18 months, he said.
   In New York City, 55 percent to 60 percent of the drug abusers
are infected, and that figure has been stable for about three
years, he said.
   ``We have seen substantial behavior change in a variety of
cities,'' he said.
   In a separate report, researchers said Tuesday that proportion
of drug-related AIDS cases among Puerto Ricans in the United States
is more than five times the rate among other Hispanic-Americans.
   Hispanics make up just 6 percent of the population but have 14.5
percent of the country's AIDS cases. As of June 6, the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control had reports of 9,362 cases in Hispanics, out of
a total of 64,506 cases.
   Richard Selik of the Centers for Disease Control said 38.6
percent of the AIDS cases among Puerto Ricans in the 50 states
occur among drug abusers or their heterosexual partners.
   He said that drug-related cases made up only 4.2 percent of the
AIDS cases in Mexican-Americans, 5 percent of the cases in
Cuban-Americans and 7.3 percent of the cases in Americans from
other Latin American countries.
   ``Efforts to prevent IVDA (intravenous drug abuse) related AIDS
in Hispanics should be concentrated on persons of Puerto Rican
origin,'' Selik said.
   In another report, a European research group said that 40
percent of infants born with the AIDS virus develop the deadly
disease or a related illness by the age of 10 months.
   In the largest study yet done of AIDS transmission to newborns,
European researchers who have followed 219 infants of infected
mothers for up to two years said it appears that 25 percent to 30
percent of infants born to infected mothers will be infected
themselves.
   Of the infected infants, 40 percent will go on to develop AIDS
or a related illness, said the study's director, Dr. Catherine
Peckham of the Institute of Child Health in London.
   Dr. George Rutherford of the San Francisco Department of Public
Health reported new findings suggesting that most _ and perhaps all
_ of the 1 million or more Americans infected with the AIDS virus
will ultimately develop AIDS.
   An AIDS expert at the Centers for Disease Control agreed. ``The
majority will get it,'' said Dr. Harold Jaffe. ``Whether that will
be 70, 90 or 100 percent, we still don't know.''
   Rutherford has followed 71 men whose blood had been tested
regularly for up to 10 years as part of a study of hepatitis.
   Tests of their blood samples show that 40 percent were sick with
AIDS within nine years of becoming infected and that figure had
climbed to 48 percent 10 years after infection.

<HEAD>Army Announces Formation Of Rapid Response Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese army has established a rapid response
unit called the Fist Battalion to give more punch to China's
military under a reform program begun after an embarrassing
mini-war with Vietnam in 1979.
   The battalion will be able to parachute into deserts, deep
forest or marshland and conduct guerrilla warfare, the Xinhua News
Agency said today, quoting a report in Tuesday's Liberation Army
Daily.
   The battalion will also be able to reach any place inside China
in less than 20 hours to respond to emergencies, the official news
agency said.
   It did not say whether the unit might also be sent outside China
if national interests are at stake.
   The report also did not disclose the size of the unit or say
when it was formed, but the paper published two pictures dated 1986
showing members parachuting and drilling on a snow-covered hill in
China's northeast.
   Since faring badly in a brief border war with Vietnam in 1979,
China's military has undergone a major overhaul. Manpower has been
cut by 1 million, to 3 million troops, and greater emphasis has
been put on holding battle drills and upgrading troops' technical
skills.
   A 56,000-strong marine corps was set up in 1980 as a division of
the navy's South China Sea Fleet. Its mission is to defend coastal
areas and the Xisha (Paracels) and Nansha (Spratleys) island chains
in the South China Sea that also are claimed by Vietnam and several
other East Asian nations.
   The official China Daily recently reported that the marines are
stepping up their training and acquiring new equipment. It gave no
other details.
   Today's report said the Fist Battalion may set an example for
ordinary battalions to follow in a program to reform training
exercises.
   The Liberation Army Daily quoted a veteran parachuter as saying
the force was comparable to parachute units in the world's most
advanced countries.

<HEAD>Contestant Plotted Disruption For More Than A Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college student says she dieted, took voice
lessons and spent $5,000 during the 18 months that she plotted to
disrupt the Miss California pageant and ``expose the lies they
promote.''
   Michelle Anderson, Miss Santa Cruz in Monday's contest, pulled
from her bra a white silk banner reading ``Pageants Hurt All
Women'' just as the winner, Marlise Ricardos, was to be announced.
   Other participants yanked the banner from her, and security
guards promptly removed Miss Anderson from the San Diego Civic
Center's stage.
   ``I wanted to go behind the scenes of pageants and expose the
lies they promote, such as women like to be judged by men, or like
to duct tape their breasts ... or starve to be thin,'' Anderson
told a news conference Tuesday.
   She said the message beauty pageants give women is that to be
beautiful, they have to be thin, blond and young.
   ``Women suffer severe indignities to try to be beautiful
according to these standards,'' she said.
   Anderson, 21, a junior at the University of California, Santa
Cruz majoring in community studies, said her protest cost her the
Miss Santa Cruz title and a $3,000 scholarship.
   ``She really took us in,'' said Donna Williams, the executive
director of the Santa Cruz pageant. ``I think I'm a pretty wise
person. We've known her for two years, and I never had an inkling.''
   Victoria Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Miss California pageant,
said the pageant was helpless to prevent future protests from what
she termed a ``plant.''
   ``I know it broke the heart of the people running the Santa Cruz
pageant. They put so much time and effort in coaching, searching
for the right person. She (Anderson) cheated another person out of
a scholarship,'' Ms. Garcia said.
   Anderson said the idea for the stunt came during a protest
planning session with former model Ann Simonton, whose Santa
Cruz-based group, MediaWatch, has staged a number of pageant
demonstrations.
   The plan was for Anderson to get to the largest audience before
sharing her message, the women said. If she'd won the Miss
California pageant, she would have kept silent until reaching the
Miss America pageant.
   It took Anderson two tries to capture the Miss Santa Cruz title.
She was the second runner-up in 1987.
   According to Anderson, who said she is working on a book about
her pageant experiences, contestants must suspend their studies and
spend an enormous amount of time and money on getting their bodies
and talent in shape. Most spend far more than they win, she said.
   Anderson said she spent $5,000, lost 15 pounds, bleached her
hair, exercised and took voice lessons.
   She said she doesn't regret her actions, even though she is
sorry for hurting pageant organizers in Santa Cruz.
   ``But they're doing the wrong thing for women,'' Anderson said,
``and I'm more interested in standing up for women than being nice
and socially acceptable.''

<HEAD>Dollar And Gold Higher In Early European Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in early European trading today
and and dealers predicted it would continue to climb following the
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit. Gold prices also rose.
   Dealers said Tuesday's trade figures for April, showing the
deficit had narrowed unexpectedly to $9.89 billion from a revised
$11.70 billion in March, had boosted bullish sentiment on the
dollar.
   Gerhard Roggemann, treasurer of J.P. Morgan GmbH in Frankfurt,
said: ``We are still bullish on the dollar.''
   Several traders said they expected the market to try to test
1.75 marks sometime today. But another trader in Milan argued that
the West German Bundesbank would almost certainly intervene if the
dollar moved above 1.75 marks.
   In early trading, the dollar was selling at 1.7484 marks, up
from 1.7460 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.27 yen to a closing 126.32. Later, in
London, it was quoted slightly lower at 126.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates:
   _ 1.4637 Swiss francs, up from 1.4615
   _ 5.89475 French francs, up from 5.8840
   _ 1.96335 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9600
   _ 1,298.50 Italian lire, up from 1,292.50
   _ 1.2192 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2162
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7862 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7925 late Tuesday.
   Bullion dealers said the market was confused by bullion's
non-reaction to the U.S. trade figures.
   Normally, bullion prices would have been expected to tumble, but
gold fell only slightly after the figures were announced and then
recovered.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $449.70 a troy ounce and
at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $450.30. Both were up from Tuesday's late bid
of $448.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $450.40, up from $448.00 late
Tuesday.
   The Hong Kong Chinese Silver and Gold Society, which quotes
rates for the metal in Hong Kong, was closed today for the
association's elections. The society will reopen on Thursday.
   Silver was quoted in London Wednesday at a bid price of $7.04 a
troy ounce, up from late Tuesday's $6.91.

<HEAD>France And Iran To Re-establish Diplomatic Ties Thursday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France and Iran said today they will re-establish
diplomatic relations Thursday after a break of nearly a year. The
move had been expected after the May release of last three French
hostages held in Lebanon.
   The two countries severed relations July 17 after the Iranian
Embassy refused to turn over Wahid Gordji, wanted for questioning
by French authorities in connection with a series of terrorist
bombings in 1986 that killed 11 people and wounded more than 150.
   The impending exchange of ambassadors was announced by a Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Paris, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
and Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said ambassadors will be dispatched
``shortly.'' It gave no other details.
   On May 4, pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon freed Frenchmen
Marcel Fontaine, 45, and Marcel Carton, 62, both diplomats, and
journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44.
   Iran said at the time that it had intervened ``for humanitarian
reasons'' to secure the hostages' release. It also said it agreed
to mediate the release because Jacques Chirac, then France's prime
minister, had responded ``positively'' to Iranian demands.
   The conditions centered on the repayment of a billion-dollar
loan made by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran before the Islamic
revolution in 1979. Within two weeks of the hostages' release,
Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard announced that relations
would be restored.
   Rocard, the newly appointed premier, said, ``My government and
the president do not intend to pass judgment on the conditons under
which these negotiations took place.''
   Gordji, officially listed as an embassy translator without
diplomatic immunity, took refuge in the embassy in late June. He
was allowed to leave France after two other French hostages,
Jean-Louis Normandin and Roger Auque, both journalists, were freed
in Beirut on Nov. 27.
   Eighteen foreigners remain missing in Lebanon and are believed
held by pro-Iranian zealots. They are nine Americans, three
Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Indian, an Irishman and two
men of unidentified nationality.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest held captive. He was taken hostage
March 16, 1985.
   A total of 10 French hostages were freed from Lebanon during the
two years that Chirac's government was in power. One hostage,
researcher Michel Seurat, died in captivity.

   Zookeepers hope Marvin, a 5,000-pound
rhinoceros, will get the right message when he is introduced on
Father's Day weekend to two female rhinos who have failed to
reproduce since their arrival in 1974.
   Marvin's visit to the Greater Baton Rouge Zoo from Knoxville,
Tenn., for the next few months is part of a breeding program
sponsored by the American Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums to replenish the endangered species.
   George Felton, zoo director and past president of AAZPA, said
Marvin would be introduced Friday to Hatari and Wagasa, whose
previous male companion was sent to the Knoxville zoo in May as
part of the exchange program.
   Marvin is a proven sire, having fathered 13 rhino calves at
other zoos, Felton said.
   At Friday's introduction, Thomas Babin, a father of 15 named
locally as Senior Father of the Year, will present a 6-foot
Father's Day card to Marvin.
   Marvin's trip here by special trailer truck was paid for with a
$50,000 grant from the Armstrong Tire Co., which uses the rhino as
a trademark.

<HEAD>Norton Simon Withdraws Offer to Give Artwork to UCLA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired industrialist Norton Simon has
withdrawn his offer to donate his coveted $750 million art
collection to the University of California, Los Angeles, the Los
Angeles Times reported today.
   UCLA had said the gift would create ``the greatest
university-based art collection in the world.''
   A one-paragraph statement indicating the offer was dropped was
issued by the Norton Simon Art Foundation following repeated
inquiries, the newspaper said.
   UCLA also announced that negotiations between the university and
Simon had stalled, but neither party would say why.
   An unidentified source told the newspaper that one obstacle was
the university's inability to remove a rental car agency near the
site of the museum planned to house the collection on UCLA's
Westwood campus.
   The Simon collection, which includes a large number of Old
Masters as well as impressionist paintings, Asian bronzes and
sculpture, also was to be maintained at its present home in the
Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena.
   Four months ago, University Chancellor Charles Young said
negotiations were ``very far along.'' On Tuesday, he declined to
comment on the foundation's statement.
   The Norton Simon statement said problems ``in both the substance
of the negotiations and in the manner in which UCLA conducted
them'' stalled talks.
   ``We negotiated diligently with Mr. Simon,'' the UCLA statement
said. ``Mr. Simon asked for a break in negotiations while he
attended to other matters, and said he would get back to us. He has
not gotten back to us.''
   Five months ago, negotiations collapsed between industrialist
Armand Hammer and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art over the
future of Hammer's collection of Old Masters, impressionist
paintings and other art.
   After the museum rejected various conditions, the chairman of
Occidental Petroleum Corp. decided not to donate his collection but
to build his own museum in Westwood.

   Twelve minutes and 46 seconds after takeoff, the rocket reached
orbit with its international payload, the European Meteosat-Ps and
AMSAT-3C and the American PAS-1.
   Ariane-4 is capable of hauling up to 4.6 tons into orbit.
Ariane-3, the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8
tons.
   In addition to its increased power, the rocket design allows
engineers to strap on different configurations of solid and liquid
boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's specific budget and
needs, the agency said.
   Ariane-4 will be Europe's ``workhorse on the world launch
services market until the end of this century,'' according to
Arianespace officials.
   Developed over the past six years at a cost of $575, Ariane-4
will be competing in the coming decade with America, the Soviet
Union, China and Japan.
   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloads
and currently holds 67 launch contracts worth $3.4 billion.
   For the inaugural launch, Ariane-4 put into geostationary orbit
Meteostat-P2 which will furnish weather data to 16 European
countries.
   The 1,559 pound satellite will monitor weather over most of
Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of South
America.
   It replaces the Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which until
recently sent back pictures every half hour.
   The 330 pound Amsat-3C, known by the knickname Oscar-13, will
serve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world.
   Meteosat and Oscar reached orbit about 20 minutes after blast
off.
   About three minutes later, the American satellite PAS-1 reached
orbit. The satellite owned by the American telecommunications
company Pan American satellite will further telecommuncations
service at moderate cost between Latin America, the United States
and Europe.
   Officials at the space center called the inaugural launch a
complete success.

<TEXT>
   A Jewish family again was refused permission to
emigrate, two weeks after President Reagan canceled a meeting with
them for fear of dooming their 11-year campaign to leave.
   Tanya Zieman, whose 12-year-old daughter had appealed to the
president and Mrs. Reagan for help in leaving the country, said she
received the news Tuesday evening from the Moscow City Council.
   She said the council told her the family's appeal was turned
down by a review commission of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's
nominal parliament, and that the family could reapply to emigrate
after 1992.
   During the Reagans' summit trip to Moscow two weeks ago, U.S.
sources said the American first family agonized over whether to
stop at the Ziemans' home after a top Soviet Foreign Ministry
official warned such a visit would ruin the family's chances to
emigrate.
   The Ziemans' younger daughter, Vera, who calls herself ``a
lifelong refusenik'' because her family applied to emigrate shortly
after she was born, had written the Reagans asking for their help.
   White House officials had been to the Ziemans' tiny, three-room
apartment in southwest Moscow to survey the home for a presidential
visit the week before the Reagans' May 29 arrival in Moscow.
   Soviet authorities, getting wind of the plans, sent a swarm of
workers to repave the drive, paint the apartment building, repair
the stoop, scrub the corridor walls and landscape nearby flower
beds.
   A massive security force deployed around the building the day
the Reagans arrived in the capital drew a crowd of several hundred
local residents.
   But U.S. and Soviet sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh warned U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock and an accompanying White House official
that if the Reagans went through with the visit, the Ziemans would
never leave the country.
   In the end, the Reagans scrubbed the plan.
   ``They didn't want to knuckle under to intimidation, but they
didn't want to hurt the Ziemans, either,'' one source said.
   The family, headed by Yuri Zieman, a former computer specialist,
did attend a tea the Reagans gave for people the U.S.
administration considers victims of Soviet human rights abuses.
   Yuri Zieman, who lost his job when he applied to emigrate in
1977, worked as a plumber until he was stricken several months ago
by a mysterious brain ailment that has left him with double vision
and a loss of balance.
   During his hospitalization for that condition, he contracted
hepatitis, and his wife said Tuesday he remained very weak.
   Zieman has been told he is not permitted to leave the country
for security reasons, although he contends he never had access to
state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet
security.
   ``He had been feeling much better the last two weeks, thinking
we would be getting some good news soon'' following the Moscow
summit, Mrs. Zieman said Tuesday.
   Asked if the family would apply again for exit visas, she said,
``I'm still very much in a fighting mood.''

   A man has been arrested on charges he
dropped a 50-pound concrete block through a car windshield from an
overpass, killing the driver.
   Mark Weston Casey, 18, of North Fort Myers, was charged Tuesday
with manslaughter, throwing a deadly missile into a vehicle and
leaving the scene of a fatal accident, said the Highway Patrol.
   The concrete block caused Rodrick McDuff's station wagon to
careen out of control and flip over Jan. 19 on an interstate
highway. McDuff, 32, of Fort Myers, was returning home from a
business trip just before midnight.
   Casey was taken Tuesday to the Southwest Florida Juvenile
Detention Center, said Lt. Malcolm Rhodes. Prosecutors have not
determined whether he will be tried as an adult or juvenile. Casey
was 17 at the time of the accident.
   If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison.
   Rhodes said that with no witnesses, ``We're very lucky to get an
arrest.'' He said only that troopers talked to people who had
knowledge of the accident.
   McDuff was a district supervisor for the Rite Aid Corp. The
pharmacy chain offered a $5,000 reward and volunteered two of its
private investigators to help on the case.

   The European Space Agency launched
its new, powerful generation of Ariane rocket today, lifting three
satellites into orbit and showing future customers that the vehicle
is ready for service.
   Ariane-4 blasted off without a hitch from the European Space
Agency space center on the north coast of South America at 7:19
a.m. EDT. Sixty-six seconds later the first-stage boosters fired
according to plan, with the final, third-stage rockets firing at 5
minutes 49 seconds after takeoff.
   The space shot was designed by Arianespace, the agency's
commercial arm, to demonstrate the space readiness of the Ariane-4,
Europe's biggest and most versatile rocket ever.
   Twelve minutes and 46 seconds after takeoff, the rocket reached
orbit with its international payload, the European Meteosat-Ps and
AMSAT-3C and the American PAS-1.
   Ariane-4 is capable of hauling up to 4.6 tons into orbit.
Ariane-3, the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8
tons.
   In addition to its increased power, the rocket design allows
engineers to strap on different configurations of solid and liquid
boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's specific budget and
needs, the agency said.
   Ariane-4 will be Europe's ``workhorse on the world launch
services market until the end of this century,'' according to
Arianespace officials.
   Developed over the past six years at a cost of $575 million,
Ariane-4 will be competing in the coming decade with the United
States, the Soviet Union, China and Japan.
   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloads
and currently holds 67 launch contracts worth $3.4 billion.
   For the inaugural launch, Ariane-4 put into geostationary orbit
Meteostat-P2 which will furnish weather data to 16 European
countries.
   The 1,559-pound satellite will monitor weather over most of
Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of South
America.
   It replaces the Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which until
recently sent back pictures every half hour.
   The 330 pound Amsat-3C, known by the knickname Oscar-13, will
serve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world.
   Meteosat and Oscar reached orbit about 20 minutes after blast
off.
   About three minutes later, the American satellite PAS-1 reached
orbit. The satellite owned by the American telecommunications
company Pan American Satellite will further telecommuncations
service at moderate cost between Latin America, the United States
and Europe.
   Officials at the space center called the inaugural launch a
complete success.

   Syria and Iran have reached an agreement
calling for the gradual release of 18 foreign hostages held by
Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon, a Beirut newspaper reported
today.
   In London today, the Guardian newspaper said a U.S. envoy has
returned to Lebanon to seek the hostages' releases.
   Neither report could be confirmed independently.
   Ad-Diyar, a daily newspaper based in Christian east Beirut,
cited an unidentified Hezbollah source for its report. Hezbollah is
an Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group believed to hold the
foreigners.
   ``A Hezbollah source involved in the case of the foreign
hostages disclosed that a Syrian-Iranian agreement has been reached
regarding the hostages,'' Ad-Diyar said. ``The deal calls for their
(hostages') gradual release,'' the report said. It provided no
other details.
   The Guardian reported a U.S. envoy has returned to Lebanon for a
second round of secret talks with Hezbollah. The newspaper quoted
unidentified Shiite sources in west Beirut as saying the envoy,
identified only as a Lebanese dispatched from Washington, left
Beirut on June 3 at the end of a first visit and returned Sunday.
   The Shiite sources insisted, despite denials by the U.S. State
Department, that U.S. and Iranian officials have held recent talks
in Geneva ``and say one of Iran's demands is spare parts for its
decrepit air force,'' wrote the Guardian's Beirut correspondent,
Julie Flint.
   The State Department denied a report, published June 7 in the
Times of London, saying the Reagan administration opened talks with
Iranian officials in April in hopes of finding a ``legal'' formula
to secure the release of the U.S. hostages.
   Methods would involve the paying of compensation to Iran and the
release of Iranian assets frozen after the 1979 Islamic revolution
that overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Times reported.

<HEAD>Graham Preaches to His Largest Soviet Crowd Ever</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. evangelist Billy Graham preached to his
largest audience in the Soviet Union as at least 10,000 people
jammed into an Orthodox church in Kiev or listened outside over
loudspeakers, Graham's spokesman said today.
   Graham, a Southern Baptist minister, is taking part in
government-sanctioned celebrations marking the 1,000th anniversary
of Christianity in what is now the Soviet Union.
   His spokesman, Edward E. Plowman, said Graham delivered a
15-minute sermon Tuesday night in St. Vladimir's cathedral in Kiev.
   ``The crowd was absolutely jammed in there, with a lot of people
up front holding tape recorders to catch what was said,'' Plowman
said in a telephone interview from Kiev.
   Church officials also put up large loudspeakers outside for the
overflow crowd.
   In the sermon, which was translated into Russian by an Orthodox
priest, Graham preached that God and human nature never change
despite changes in the world, Plowman said.
   Plowman said 10,000 people listened to Graham during the
two-hour service, but officials at St. Vladimir's said the crowd
numbered between 10,000 and 15,000. Plowman called it the largest
group to hear Graham during his three trips to the Soviet Union.
   Graham also visited the Soviet Union in 1982 and 1984.
   During his 1982 visit, he aroused controversy by saying he
thought the church in the Soviet Union was free. This time, he has
said only that ``the people seem to be warmer, that makes me
glad,'' according to Plowman.
   Plowman said Graham will preach tonight at a Kiev Baptist
church, and that several thousand Soviet Baptists and
Pentecostalists had gathered in the Ukrainian capital, some
traveling hundreds of miles for the service.
   Graham is scheduled to leave the Soviet Union Friday night.

<HEAD>Authorities Remove 29 Girls From Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARCADIA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities investigating allegations of
abuse at a boarding school for girls cut the home's locked gates
and removed 29 students.
   A spokesman at the private New Bethany Home for Girls called the
action Tuesday an illegal raid. All 52 girls, ranging in age from
12 to 17, were told they could leave the school, but 23 remained,
an official said.
   ``We feel this is a gross violation of civil rights,'' said Bob
Sensat, a member of the home's board. He denied allegations of
abuse.
   The state Department of Health and Human Resources obtained a
court order to search the complex and interview the girls after
receiving complaints from a runaway, said Lucky Raley, chief
criminal investigator for the Bienville Parish sheriff.
   About 30 girls flee the institution each year, the juvenile
officer said. Sheriff Aarvis Whitman calls the home a prison and
has refused to send back runaways.
   Juvenile authorities said the girls removed from the home were
placed in temporary housing.
   ``Yes, praise God!''``I'm going home, finally,'' one girl said
as tears streamed down her face.
   One girl said she received 20 ``licks'' with a paddle for having
rock music tapes and for cutting her bangs.
   DHHR officials, two state troopers and five deputies arrived
Tuesday at the school, which is situated 3.5 miles south of here
and is surrounded by a 6-foot chain link fence topped with barbed
wire.
   ``They said come on in, but you're going to have to cut the lock
to get in. So we did,'' said Raley.
   Some girls who chose to remain at the school chastised departing
students from inside the yard. ``We are staying here with the
Lord,'' one said.
   The raid was a violation of constitutional rights because of the
separation of church and state, Sensat said, adding that the state
had no right to intervene because the home receives no government
funding.
   The Rev. Mack W. Ford, pastor and director of the home, was in
South Carolina, Sensat said. Ford founded the institution in 1971.
   ``The state has no right to dictate to the church how to carry
on its ministry when we do not have any proven abuse cases. They
came in merely on assumption,'' Sensat said.
   DHHR tried to close the school in 1980 for refusing to allow an
inspection and licensing, but a judge ruled the state lacked such
authority. DHHR had received a number of complaints in 1979 about
the home's operation.
   On Friday, the Bethel Home for Children, a fundamentalist
boarding school in Lucedale, Miss., was shut down. Its proprietor,
the Rev. Herman Fountain, was arrested on charges of assulting a
police officer and inciting a riot.
   Authorities have charged that the Bethel Home abused and
neglected its students.

   Kidnappers holding the three children of
a wealthy Lebanese businessman have demanded a $3 million ransom,
police said today.
   A police spokesman said the Sunni Moslem businessman, Zuhair
Ariss ``received a call from the kidnappers Tuesday night demanding
$3 million'' for the release of his daughter and two sons.
   Six gunmen armed with silencer-equipped pistols abducted Ariss'
14-year-old daughter, Dunia, and sons Samer, 9, and Ramzi, 5, as
they were being driven to school in their family car on Tuesday.
The gunmen shot the driver in the legs before taking the children.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named under regulations,
said four suspects were arrested late Tuesday in a raid on the
bomb-ravaged Hilton Hotel that has long served as a base for the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God. The 10-story
building, still unfinished, was damaged in the early days of the
13-year-old civil war.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for kidnappers holding
18 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The spokesman said the detainees have ``disclosed the identity
of the kidnappers,'' but would not elaborate.
   He said Lebanese and Syrian security agents were on alert and
the two commands had issued ``clear orders _ the children must be
saved and the kidnappers must be arrested.''
   He added that Syria, which has 7,500 soldiers policing west
Beirut, regarded the kidnapping as ``a major challenge to its
law-enforcing efforts.'' Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
They control west Beirut, the city's southern suburbs, and the
eastern and northern provinces.

   Israeli troops clashed with stone-throwing
Palestinians blocking roads near Bethlehem today and killed a
21-year-old Arab, a hospital official said. The army said it was
investigating the report.
   It was the 208th Palestinian death in the 6-month-old Arab
uprising against Israel and came as Arabs shut down the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip in a daylong general strike.
   An official from Beit Jalla Hospital identified the victim as
Nidal Ibrahim Hassan and said Israeli troops shot him in the head
during a confrontation in the village of Battir, five miles
northwest of Bethlehem.
   Arab youths had blocked roads in Battir to prevent workers from
going to their jobs, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. They threw stones and bottles at Israeli soldiers who
arrived at the scene, he said.
   Today's strike was in solidarity with Arab students held in
Israeli jails and also came in response to a call circulated on an
underground leaflet.
   Israel's army responded to the strike by stepping up patrols and
closing 16 Arab bus companies in the West Bank and Arab east
Jerusalem for a week.
   The army also ordered a two-day closure of West Bank schools,
which military officers say are a source of renewed violence.
   ``We hope these two days will serve as a hint to those students
who want to study, to those parents who send their children to
school and to those who are behind the disturbances, so they will
let the students complete the school year,'' Brig. Gen. Shaike
Erez, head of the West Bank's military administration, said on
Israel radio.
   West Bank schools, a flashpoint for anti-Israeli protests during
the Palestinian uprising, were shut down in February. Studies have
resumed gradually in the past three weeks, with high school
students the last to return June 6.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, schools have remained open for most
of the uprising.
   Israeli authorities closed 14 bus companies in Arab east
Jerusalem for a week starting Thursday as punishment for the
company's participation in commercial strikes, Arab reports said.
   Also closed were the Ramallah Bus Company and the Bethlehem
National Bus Company, the companies' owners said.
   Virtually all shops were closed and most streets empty today
from Bethlehem to the northern city of Nablus in the West Bank and
in the seaside Gaza Strip.
   In Bethlehem, graffiti on walls warned in Arabic: ``Observe The
Strike, Or Else!'' Some roads were blocked by boulders. In Nablus,
outlawed Palestinian flags flapped from electrical poles.
   ``It is wishful thinking for the Israelis to say the uprising is
dying,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, an English teacher at the West Bank's
Bir Zeit University. ``To end the occupation, people are willing to
sacrifice.''
   On Tuesday, the army said 2,500 Arabs had been ordered held for
up to six months without charges, up 500 from last month.
   Army officials said they could not provide figures on how many
of the about 5,000 Arabs in Israeli jails are students. The army
has said most administrative detainees are members of Shabibe, a
youth group linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The army also said that dozens of Israeli soldiers have been
convicted of or charged with use of excessive force and other
violations of army policy since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the
West Bank and Gaza.
   The chief military prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov, said
that since the uprising began, military police have opened 350
investigations.
   About 230 investigations have been completed and dozens of
soldiers have been convicted of or charged with violating army
regulations. Strashnov would not elaborate.
   Current army policy allows soldiers to club Arabs to break up
demonstrations, but prohibits beatings once a suspect is in
custody. Soldiers may only open fire in self-defense.
   In all, 208 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed since
the uprising began.

   Police have arrested the mother of a
7-year-old girl who found a plastic-wrapped chunk of cocaine in her
backpack and tasted it with eight curious playmates at lunch,
sheriff's deputies said.
   The nine pupils were treated at Canoga Park Community Hospital
for stomach aches and released.
   Maria Christina Torres, 39, a native of Colombia who has been in
the United States for 20 years and lives in Topanga Canyon, was
booked for investigation of child endangerment and released on
$100,000 bail, said Lt. Bill Gaida.
   Mrs. Torres' daughter, Angelina Valdez, found the cocaine during
lunch Monday at Canoga Park Lutheran School, 25 miles from downtown
Los Angeles, Gaida said.
   ``She thought it was medicine and her curiosity was aroused,''
Gaida said. ``She tasted it and it tasted bitter.''
   The girl passed it around to eight pupils, ages 7 to 11, Gaida
said, adding, ``All their curiosity was aroused at this point and
they all tasted it.''
   A ``real sharp'' sixth-grader saw what was going on and took the
cocaine from the youngsters and gave it to a school administrator
``who thought the material was soap and threw it in the trash,''
Gaida said.
   Later, Mrs. Torres came to school explained that she had left
soap in her child's backpack, he said.
   A school official retrieved the chunk from a wastebasket and
broke off a piece without the woman's knowledge, Gaida said. A test
determined it was a half-gram of cocaine worth about $50, the
lieutenant said.

   NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher said
today he is confident the next president will set a goal of having
astronauts return to the moon or fly to Mars.
   Fletcher, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ``is back on
track'' with a long-range goal of moving beyond the construction of
a space station and into the Solar System.
   But he said the space station is threatened by possible budget
cuts. Fletcher earlier warned that he would recommend killing the
space station program if Congress makes proposed deep cuts in the
agency's requested $11.5 billion budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   Fletcher said pressure to reduce spending has prevented
President Reagan from setting the goal of long manned space flights.
   ``The next step, whether we go back to the moon or go to Mars,
is to build a space station, and that is in considerable doubt
right now due to the severe budget crunch,'' he said. ``That is the
next thing the president has to focus on, and I think he will.''
   Fletcher said he expects the United States to have a space
station by the end of the century.
   ``Even if we don't get the funding this year, the next
prrsident, I'm sure, will sign up for the space station and an
appropriate goal, probably Mars of the moon,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate In Memory of Stalin's Mass Deportations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people demonstrated in three Baltic
republics to mark Stalin's mass deportations of Latvians,
Lithuanians and Estonians in the 1940s, Soviet media said today.
Two people were reportedly arrested after raising the Lithuanian
flag.
   Officially sanctioned rallies were held Tuesday in Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania, according to dispatches by the official
Soviet news agency Tass printed in today's edition of the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda.
   Unofficial groups also demonstrated in the three republics,
according to reports from the state-controlled media and from
emigre groups.
   The decision to allow the demonstrations was part of Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign to reform the Soviet Union,
but it was combined with sharp rhetoric and police harassment
against some human rights activists in the republics.
   Two activists were reportedly arrested by plainclothes KGB
officers at an unofficial rally attended by 6,000 people in
Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, the most rebellious of the Baltic
republics, according to emigre sources.
   The activists, Leonas Laurinskas and Genute Sakaliene, raised
the tri-colored flag of independent Lithuania at the rally. KGB
officers pulled down the flag and held the two activists for a few
hours, according to Lithuanian Catholic Religious Aid, an emigre
group based in New York.
   During the official commemoration in Vilnius, attended by 500
Lithuanians, ``some extremist-minded people tried to impart to the
meeting a demagogic character and channel it to the route of
nationalism,'' Tass said.
   In Washington, President Reagan proclamed Tuesday ``Baltic
Freedom Day,'' and said the United States will never recognize the
forcible incorporation of the republics into the Soviet Union.
   ``The situation has improved for some Soviet human rights
activists in recent months,'' the U.S. statement said. ``But Baltic
men and women still suffer imprisonment, banishment and persecution
for daring to protest the continuing suppression of their national
independence and cultures.''
   Soviet officials reject U.S. condemnation of the annexation,
carried out in June 1940 under a secret protocol of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
   But as part of Gorbachev's campaign to change the system created
by Kremlin dictator Josef V. Stalin, Soviet officials now
acknowledge that heavy-handed methods were used.
   Before Gorbachev came to power, Soviet authorities generally
tried to forestall demonstrations in the Baltic republics.
   But they allowed demonstrations on June 14, 1987, and last month
in Vilnius sponsored an official commemoration of a mass
deportation that took place in 1947. However, they broke up an
unofficial demonstration attended by 5,000 people in Vilnius on the
same day and harassed people at an unofficial rally Tuesday.
   Tuesday marked the 47th anniversary of the first mass
deportation when, Tass said, ``thousands of families were illegally
deported from Estonia by the Stalinist administrative-bureaucratic
system.'' Memorial meetings were held in Tallin, the Estonian
capital, and Tartus and Piarnu.
   Alfred Rudiks, mayor of Riga, capital of Latvia, told an
official rally there that the government of the republic had
``approved the initiative of young people to build in Riga a
monument to victim's of Stalin's personality cult.''
   Official reports of the mass deportations accused many of the
victims of being Nazi sympathizers, and said that Baltic emigre
groups were seeking to undermine Soviet authority.
   ``We justifiably condemn the policy of cruelty,'' Tass quoted
historian Jan Riekstins as telling a demonstration which it said
was attended by ``many thousands'' of people.
   Emigre Lithuanian groups say that 36,000 were deported in 1941
and another 200,000 in 1948.
   Official Soviet historians say a total of 31,000 Latvians were
deported in 1941, when the Baltic republics were occupied by the
Red Army, and in 1949, after the Soviets had defeated the Nazis.
   Tass said that, ``apart from those who were deservedly punished
for acts of political sabotage, collaboration with fascists,
banditism and espionage, the deportees also included innocent
people.''
   Tass also had harsh words for a Latvian human rights activist
who organized an unofficial demonstration there, Edmund Cirvilis,
whom it called ``a former Nazi soldier who was sent to Latvia on a
terrorist mission in 1945.''
   Repeated efforts to telephone activists in the Baltic republics
were unsuccessful.
   Last month, Soviet police broke up a demonstration by 5,000
Lithuanians marking the anniversary of the 1949 deportations,
according to Lithuanian activists.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. declarations on human rights are violated by
more than half of the organization's 159 member states, Amnesty
International said today.
   The London-based human rights organization said that since
January it had taken up 487 cases in 85 countries of people jailed
for the non-violent exercise of their rights as defined by the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   This brings the number of cases investigated by the group to
3,352 cases in the 85 countries, said a release on Amnesty
International's work during the first four months of this year.
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N.
General Assembly in 1948, promises civil, political, economic,
social, and cultural rights for all people.
   Amnesty said it had issued 115 urgent appeals in the first four
months of 1988 to help more than 450 prisoners in 45 countries whom
it feared were at risk of torture, death in prison, or other
flagrant violations of international norms.
   The organization sent 18 missions to 15 countries and issued 98
documents on human rights developments in the same time period.
   ``None of these reports or initiatives should have been
necessary,'' Amnesty said. ``In the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, such abuses should have
become only a ghost from the past.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Announces It Will Withdraw Military Command At End Of

   Vietnam announced today it will
withdraw its military command from Cambodia on June 30 as part of a
planned pullout of about 50,000 troops by the end of the year.
   A statement from the Ministry of National Defense said the
command and supporting units were returning home this month under
an agreement with the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government.
   ``The command itself, (along) with the commanding body, shall
leave Kampuchea (Cambodia) on June 30, 1988,'' the statement said.
   It said the remaining Vietnamese forces then would placed under
Cambodian government command in its battles against guerrilla
groups.
   The brief statement was carried by the official Radio Hanoi,
monitored in Bangkok.
   A similar announcement from the Cambodian Ministry of National
Defense said a farewell ceremony for the Vietnamese would be held
June 30 in Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh.
   The Cambodian communique was carried by the official SPK news
agency.
   Vietnam announced May 26 that it will withdraw 50,000 troops by
year's end as part of its plan for a complete pullout by 1990.
Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say some troops
already have left.
   The United States estimates that there are 120,000 Vietnamese
troops in Cambodia fighting 50,000 or more guerrillas backed by
China, Thailand and other Asian and Western countries.
   Vietnam also said the Cambodian government it installed a 1978
invasion could take over the war against the guerrillas, although
Western diplomats doubt it.
   The United States says that 15,000 to 20,000 Vietnamese troops
returned home last November and calls it the only genuine
withdrawal of the six annual pullouts Vietnam claims to have made
since 1982.
   A senior Western diplomat based in Hanoi, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Vietnam was seeking to ensure the Khmer Rouge do
not return to power in Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge communists massacred hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians during their 1975-78 rule, which ended when Vietnam
invaded. The Khmer Rouge is now the largest of the three guerrilla
groups.
   The diplomat said he expected Vietnam to raise the issue at
informal peace talks planned for Jakarta, Indonesia, in July. The
talks will be the first to bring together the Cambodian government
and the three guerrilla groups, and at a second stage of
discussions, Vietnam and other concerned countries.
   ``They will want (at the talks) an absolute guarantee of a
cessation of support for Khmer Rouge military activity,'' the
diplomat said.

<HEAD>Armenian Legislature Endorses Annexation Move</HEAD>

   The Armenian legislature today endorsed a move to
annex part of a neighboring republic, turning a fierce ethnic
dispute into a constitutional issue for the central Soviet
government to resolve.
   A correspondent for the Armenian Communist Party newspaper
Kommunist said the southern republic's Supreme Soviet voted to
approve the request of the disputed region's legislature to secede
from Azerbaijan and join Armenia.
   He said the meeting was broadcast live on television, a first
for the republic.
   In Moscow, several hundred Armenians applauded and raised
clenched fists as Tiran Gureghian, the Armenian church
representative in Moscow, told them the vote had been unanimous to
annex the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is predominantly Armenian.
   Azerbaijan's Supreme Soviet voted Monday to reject the move,
saying it would ``be contrary to the interests of the Azerbaijani
and Armenian population of the republic.''
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have long been divided by religion
and culture. Most Armenians are Christian while most Azerbaijanis
are Moslem.
   The dispute appears headed for consideration by the central
government's Supreme Soviet in Moscow, which according to the
Soviet constitution must resolve territorial disputes among the
country's 15 republics.
   Moscow Communist Party officials rejected the annexation demand
in February, touching off a wave of ethnic violence and strikes in
the two southern republics.
   Gureghian, speaking from the steps of the red-brick church in a
wooded Armenian cemetery, said Armenians would now wait for
Moscow's decision: ``The people are united in their mood. Everyone
is waiting for a just decision.''
   The Kommunist correspondent, speaking from the Armenian capital
of Yerevan on condition of anonymity, said seven deputies spoke
before the republic's Supreme Soviet voted today on the decree.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's Council of People's Deputies, the area's
legislature, voted Feb. 20 to request the transfer. The region's
Communist Party committee endorsed the move a month later, saying
it was wrong to make the area part of Azerbaijan in 1923 during the
formative years of the Soviet state.
   More than three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's 160,000 people
are ethnic Armenians.
   Unrest over the dispute began in February and on the 28th of
that month, there were riots in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait in
which 32 people were killed, most of them Armenians.
   The crisis, which has touched off economically damaging strikes
in the disputed region and brought out thousands of demonstrators
in Yerevan, represents a major test of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' which permits more open
discussion of Soviet problems.
   With the Armenian and Azerbaijani governments now taking
opposite stands on the issue, the dispute sets up a legal test as
well.
   ``Moscow will now have to play the role of an arbitrator,'' the
journalist said.
   The Soviet Constitution requires that changes in territorial
boundaries be approved by the republics involved and be ratified by
the central government. It is unclear whether Armenians will be
able to get their way in light of the rejection of the annexation
request by Azerbaijan's government.
   Unrest related to the dispute continued today. More than 150
students remained outside Yerevan's Opera Theater, staging a sit-in
they began May 25, the Kommunist journalist said.
   Three of the students have been lying on the square in a hunger
strike since June 4, said Mofses Gorgisyan, an Armenian nationalist
activist.
   On Monday, Armenians staged a general strike in Yerevan, and
tens of thousands demonstrated.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have been striking and marching
since May 23, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda has reported.
   Elsewhere, thousands of people rallied in three Baltic republics
to mark Stalin's mass deportations of Estonians, Latvians and
Lithuanians in the 1940s.
   Officially sanctioned demonstrations were held Tuesday in
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, according to dispatches by the
official Soviet news agency Tass printed in today's edition of
Pravda.
   Unofficial groups also demonstrated in the republics, according
to reports from the state-controlled media and from emigre groups.
   Two activists who raised the Lithuanian flag were reportedly
arrested at an unofficial rally attended by 6,000 people in
Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, emigre sources said.

   One of five inmates who cut their way
out of jail was recaptured today, and two women were charged with
aiding the escape by smuggling in hacksaw blades in a jigsaw-puzzle
box, officials said.
   About 50 officers searched for the four remaining escapees, one
of them a confessed double killer and a second facing murder
charges, since their escape Sunday night from what was considered
an escape-proof jail.
   Jeffrey Charles Minnick, 22, surrendered peacefully about 6:30
a.m. in his hometown of Hope Mills, 10 miles from here, said Harold
Little, a sheriff's spokesman. Minnick was serving time for sexual
offense and burglary.
   Also this morning, Tonya Harris, 20, and Barbara Ann Murrah, 19,
were charged with providing weapons to an inmate, said Little.
   Ms. Harris, he said, told authorities she sent the blades in a
puzzle box to Jeffery Meyer at the request of Meyer and another
inmate, Frederick Glenn Evans.
   Meyer, 21, who remains at large, pleaded guilty in the ``ninja
murders'' of an elderly Cumberland County couple in 1986. Meyer, a
former soldier at nearby Fort Bragg, and a co-defendant wore black
clothes and carried weapons used by Japanese assassins, authorities
said.
   Evans, 20, apparently slipped during the escape Sunday night and
fell to the ground while trying to descend from the fourth floor,
authorities said. He was in critical condition at Highsmith-Rainey
Memorial Hospital.
   The men escaped from their cellblock after sawing through floor
plates to which bars are welded and then apparently cutting one of
the steel bars, authorities said. They used the broken bar to smash
a window, then tied sheets together to reach the ground,
authorities said.
   Among the escapees was Jerry Ronald Pond Jr., 24, who was
charged in January with murdering a 23-year-old man.
   Sheriff Morris Bedsole said he would meet with architects of the
13-year-old Law Enforcement Center to determine whether a
contractor met specifications in installing bars.
   Architect Dan MacMillan said the bars were supposed to be
impervious to normal hacksaw blades.

   Hundreds of West German and
English soccer fans brawled at a train station, setting off street
battles and window-smashing sprees that lasted into this morning.
Police said 130 rioters were arrested.
   Later, about 2,000 English fans, many of them drunk and wearing
``Invasion of Germany 1988'' T-shirts, filled streets surrounding
the main train station as Dutch fans arrived for a match in the
European Soccer Championships.
   Several hundred police kept the groups separated and directed
the Dutch fans through a side exit of the train station.
   England and the Netherlands were set to square off later today.
The two countries' fans have the worst reputations for violence
among European soccer supporters.
   ``Behave yourselves. Be a credit to your country and to your
football team. If you don't, you are doing us no good at all,''
Bobby Robson, manager of England's team, said in an appeal to fans
before the game.
   At least three police officers and an undeteday's New York Daily
News.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Mario Cuomo said Tuesday the grand jury
investigating the case should try to clear the names of anyone
wrongfully accused by the teen-ager's advisers as well as find out
if she was attacked.
   He said he has asked Attorney General Robert Abrams to continue
his investigation ``as long as there is the slightest hope of
producing evidence.''
   Abrams said last week that his investigation would be winding
down within a month if the Brawley family did not cooperate.
   The News and WCBS-TV reported Tuesday that McKinnon, a former
director of security and communications at St. Mary's Hospital,
joined the team in January. He said he broke with the others a
month ago.
   ``It's all a pack of lies,'' McKinnon was reported today to have
told the newspaper and the TV station.
   ``The real story is the political agenda of Sharpton, Maddox and
Mason,'' he told WCBS.
   McKinnon, who told the newspaper he is a former Georgia police
officer and private investigator, said that Sharpton himself
admitted having doubts about what actually happened to Miss Brawley.
   The Wappingers Fall teen-ager claims she was abducted and
sexually assaulted by up to six white men over a four-day period in
November. She was found wrapped in a garbage bag, her body covered
with excrement and racial slurs.
   Through Sharpton and her attorneys, C. Vernon Mason and Alton
Maddox Jr., Miss Brawley has refused to cooperate with the grand
jury. Her mother, Glenda Brawley, has sought sanctuary in a church
to avoid a 30-day jail sentence for refusing to testify.
   ``I brought it up to (Sharpton) that all the information doesn't
jibe to me,'' McKinnon said, ``that it just didn't show where some
whites had done it, and that we shouldn't be taken off the beaten
path by any rumors or any writing that was on her body. He said to
me, `That sounds shaky to me, too.'''
   McKinnon said: `It's not about the story, it's about them trying
to build a movement. They have dreams of winning this thing.''
   Sharpton vehemently disputed McKinnon's account and said
McKinnon was ``nothing more than a driver'' who was not privy to
strategy meetings. ``I've never had any doubt anywhere in the
case,'' he told the newspaper.
   The governor Tuesday said that everyone in the state may
eventually be victimized by the Brawley lawyers' ``frightening
mockery'' of the law. He said Mrs. Brawley should be arrested for
defying a court order to testify.
   Maddox and Mason, without offering evidence, have publicly
accused Dutchess County assistant district attorney, a state
Trooper and a former part-time Fishkill police officer of taking
part in the alleged attack.
   ``I think there's a tendency to say by some that they had their
chance to prove there was this rape, they didn't prove it, so let's
end the investigation,'' Cuomo said. ``What about the other people
who were accused? Until you explain how it did happen, how do they
defend themselves?''

   The Israeli parliament today rejected a motion
of no confidence in the country's government filed by a leftist
party over the deportation of Arab-American non-violence advocate
Mubarak Awad.
   The motion was filed by the Progressive List for Peace, a mixed
Arab-Jewish party that holds two seats in the 120-member Knesset.
It was defeated by a vote of 19 to 17, Israel radio said.
   Awad, 44, a Jerusalem-born U.S. citizen, was deported Monday
after the government accused him of inciting the six-month-old Arab
uprising in the occupied territories. Israel's Supreme Court
rejected his appeal, saying he had no legal residence permit and
was in Israel on an expired tourist visa.
   Awad, who has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio, advocates non-violent
resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
His tactics, which include general strikes, boycotts of Israeli
products and refusal to pay taxes, have been adopted by underground
leaders of the uprising.
   Legislator Roni Milo of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc told the parliament that ``if an Israeli
tourist in the United States proposed the means offered by Mubarak
Awad ... stones, firebombs, refusal to pay taxes ... he would have
been expelled to Israel within an hour.''
   ``This is the situation with Mubarak Awad and let nobody teach
us morals about it,'' said Milo, who responded to the no-confidence
motion on behalf of the government. His remarks were broadcast by
the radio.
   The motion was rejected by a combined vote of the Likud and the
right-wing Tehiya and Morasha parties against the votes of several
left-wing parties.

<HEAD>Ten More States Accuse Top Insurers of Instigating Liability
Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major U.S. insurers conspired to stop
providing some kinds of liability coverage, touching off a
nationwide insurance crisis, 10 states claimed in lawsuits.
   The suits, filed in U.S. District Court on Tuesday, follow eight
others filed in March. They claim the crisis forced municipalities
and agencies to cut back on services and crippled businesses
throughout the country.
   The new states in the federal court action are Maryland,
Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado, Montana,
Washington, Alaska and Michigan.
   New York state Attorney General Robert Abrams said the case was
one of the largest ever undertaken by a group of states in federal
court.
   The lawsuits accused 32 insurance companies and underwriting
agencies of engaging in secret agreements that included targeting
for elimination pollution insurance and general liability for
damage discovered after expiration of a policy.
   Pennsylvania Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman and New Jersey
Attorney General Cary Edwards, at a news conference in Philadelphia
on Tuesday, said they could not estimate the dollar value of the
damage claims, but that it was in the millions for their two states
alone.
   The four major insurance companies named in the suit are
Hartford Insurance Company and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company,
both of Hartford, Conn.; Allstate Insurance Co. of Northbrook,
Ill., and Cigna Corp. of Philadelphia.
   Aetna condemned the suits as ``another political move by
political office-holders who have consistently opposed any and all
effort to address the real problems of the nation's liability
system.''
   Hartford Insurance called the suits ``totally without
substance'' and expressed confidence the claims would be thrown out
of court.
   Aetna, Allstate, Cigna, and Hartford Fire Insurance Co. started
a campaign in 1984 to cut back on coverage then generally available
in the country, the suits claimed.
   The suits also alleged that the companies got major U.S. and
British reinsurers, including Lloyds of London, to threaten to
boycott any U.S. insurance company that provided broader coverage.
   The companies pressured the Insurance Services Office, a
1,400-member industry trade group, to quit distributing standard
forms in order to make it tough for companies to continue offering
certain coverage, the suits claimed.
   As a result, the suits said, property damage insurance for local
governments, nonprofit agencies such as child care centers and
various businesses suddenly became unavailable or extremely
expensive.
   ``The insurance industry finds that these attorneys general
suits are based upon a total misunderstanding of how the insurance
industry works,'' said William F. Bailey, special counsel to the
New York-based ISO.
   ``Every statement that was alleged to have been made in the
secrecy of private clubs in New York was made in open hearings in
front of state insurance commissioners,'' Bailey said. ``There was
no collusion to fix the market.''
   The 10 states who filed suit on Tuesday joined California, New
York, Massachussetts, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Alabama. Texas filed suit in its own state court.

   A treasure trove of Spanish gold, silver and
emeralds that had lain unnoticed for centuries in the waters off
Florida attracted the rich, the famous and the curious at an
auction that brought $2.5 million.
   Before Tuesday's sale, treasure hunter Mel Fisher stood on the
sidewalk outside Christie's auction house greeting passers-by,
posing for photographs and wearing around his neck pounds of gold
chain he took from the ocean floor.
   ``I want to show how safe it is in New York,'' the former
Indiana chicken farmer and California dive shop operator said
before running upstairs for the auction.
   The auction was the first of a two-day sale of booty recovered
from a pair of Spanish treasure galleons that went down in a
hurricane off the Florida Keys in 1622.
   Most of the treasure _ which included gold and silver bars,
jewelry and artifacts as well as coins, emeralds and 17th-century
navigation instruments _ came from the galleons of the Nuestra
Senora de Atocha and her sister ship, the Santa Margarita. Fisher's
expedition discovered the Atocha _ which held the richest treasure
ever recovered from the sea _ in 1971 and the Margarita nine years
later.
   However, some of the auctioned artifacts were recovered by
divers working off Florida's east coast, where a Spanish fleet went
down in a hurricane in 1715.
   A 62-inch Renaissance gold chain from the Margarita attracted
the most attention and fetched $319,000 in spirited bidding. The
chain, formed from 136 oval links, went to an anonymous telephone
bidder.
   Several brass astrolabes used to navigate the ill-fated vessels
also attracted high prices.
   ``They're very, very rare things, very important,'' Anthony
Phillips, a Christie's executive said of the instruments. Several
went to European museums that the auction house declined to
identify.
   Celebrities in the crowd included Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker
Hunt, who said he was merely a spectator, and actress Margot Kidder.
   ``I tried for some emeralds, but missed,'' she said.
   While items such as a two-handled gold cup that brought $275,000
or a silver-gilt cup that sold for $165,000 generated the most
interest, more modest items also went up on the block, including a
fishhook-shaped gold wire that fetched $308.
   Tuesday's items were offered by backers who financed Fisher's
expeditions in exchange for a share of the proceeds.

   Jim and Geoff Hall _ avid runners who have
spent many a summer breaking each other's track records _ are used
to a little brotherly competition.
   This time, the race was on in the maternity ward at Bergan Mercy
Hospital.
   The arrival of two Hall cousins on the same day, delivered by
the same doctor, began with confusion Saturday when Geoff, 27, and
his wife, Kim, arrived at Bergan's emergency entrance.
   ``We walked in and they asked, `Are you the Hall family?' We
said `yes' and then went up to delivery,'' Geoff recalled.
   ``Jim and Kathy showed up about 15 minutes later and told the
people at the desk, `We're Kathy and Jim Hall.' And the people at
the desk said, `No, you're not; they're here.'''
   Apparently, the hospital pulled the wrong medical file when the
mothers-to-be called to warn of their arrival, Geoff said.
   It was understandable. Both mothers are 27, both first names
begin with ``K'' and they had the same doctor.
   The confusion did not end at the emergency room. Geoff said that
Tuesday when he and Kim called for their Nicholas Samuel, nurses
brought in his nephew, Daniel Jerome.
   ``In high school we were all runners, so I think Jim was kind of
racing to see whose would come first,'' Geoff said. ``He kept
popping his head in our room to check.''
   ``It was kind of a race to the finish,'' said Kathy, a
long-distance runner herself. ``But, this time Geoff won.''
   Nicholas Samuel beat his cousin's arrival by five hours and 42
minutes.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Limits CIA Firing Authority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, keeping alive a gay spy's
lawsuit against the CIA, today limited the agency's authority to
fire employees without having to face court review.
   By a 6-2 vote, the court said the 1947 law creating the Central
Intelligence Agency did not give the CIA director absolute
discretion to fire employees whenever he deems it necessary.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
a CIA employee's allegations of violated constitutional rights may
be reviewed in federal court.
   The ruling flatly rejected the Reagan administration's arguments
that the spy agency should have virtually absolute authority to
fire employees if their dismissal is deemed ``in the interests of
the United States.''
   Solicitor General Charles Fried, in arguing for the CIA before
the justices last January, said, ``There does come a point where
the agency simply must be able, without giving reasons ... and
without triggering inquiry within open court'' to fire an employee
deemed a security risk.
   But Rehnquist said under the administration's view, ``all agency
employment termination decisions, even those based on policies
normally repugnant to the Constitution, are given over to the
absolute discretion of the director.''
   ``We do not think (the 1947 law) may be read to exclude review
of constitutional claims,'' Rehnquist said.
   The court, however, said federal courts may not review
non-constitutional claims stemming from CIA dismissals.
   A homosexual identified in court documents only by the
fictitious name John Doe was fired by then-CIA Director William
Casey in 1982. The agency claimed Doe's homosexuality was a
security threat.
   Doe had joined the CIA as a clerk-typist in 1973 and worked his
way up to a covert job as an electronics technician, in which he
was rated an excellent agent.
   In January 1982, he voluntarily told an agency security officer
that he was gay. Doe was placed on paid leave pending an
investigation, and that May he was told he was being fired ``in the
interests of the United States.''
   Doe told agency officials that his family, neighbors and friends
knew he was a homosexual, and that he had never revealed classified
information to any unauthorized person.
   Doe sued the agency and demanded that he be reinstated. He
argued that his constitutional rights were violated when the agency
fired him because he is gay, and that the CIA ignored its own
firing procedures by denying him a chance to appeal his dismissal.
   A federal appeals court ruled that Doe could not be fired just
because he is gay, but could be fired if found to be a legitimate
security threat.
   Today's decision upheld the appeals court ruling, and sent Doe's
case back to a federal trial judge.
   Rehnquist said the judge ``should address (Doe's) constitutional
claims and the propriety of the equitable remedies (reinstatement

<TEXT>
   The state of Ohio admits to pouring money
down a hole _ about $93,000 of it.
   State geologists recently used 200 pounds of old shredded bills
from the Federal Reserve Bank to fill in crevices in a 3-inch
diameter, 4,000-foot hole.
   The state Geological Survey began drilling the hole in a Wayne
Township quarry in October as part of an effort to map the state's
underground strata.
   Water is pumped into the hole as a lubricant and coolant for the
diamond-studded drill bit, then pumped back up, said geologist Mike
Hansen. At 1,800 feet, geologists found that the water was
disappearing, seeping into crevices.
   Doug Crowell, geologist and supervisor of the drilling program,
said drillers who had attended a seminar at Wright State University
a few years ago told him about using bills as a sealing agent.
   ``We tried some standard products and just weren't getting any
results,'' Crowell said. ``We tried the money and it worked.
Because of the high linen content, it doesn't dissolve easily and
works well as a sealer.''

<HEAD>Women Spend More Time In Restroom Than Men, Researchers Find</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's official: women spend more time in the
restroom than men.
   Two Virginia Tech researchers, armed with stop watches and
questionnaires, found that a woman's visit to a public restroom
runs 50 percent longer than a man's.
   One reason, Savannah S. Day, a Virginia Tech professor of
housing, and Sandra K. Rawls, who used the research to earn her
doctorate, said Tuesday is that women often have youngsters in tow.
   Another factor, they said, is that women are often hindered by
large handbags and packages.
   The researchers spent several months timing more than 450 people
going in and out of restrooms at sports arenas, a conference
center, an airport and a highway rest area.
   A restroom stop by a woman averaged between 153 seconds and 181
seconds, according to their findings. The men's average was between
84 seconds and 113 seconds.
   The findings have a bearing on the legislative issue of potty
parity.
   State Rep. John A. Rollison III is planning hearings in October
on the ratio of men's restrooms to women's in public buildings.
Some claim the standard 50-50 split is not equal. Rollison said he
would like to increase the number of women's facilities.
   ``We know it's a fact that women do take longer,'' said Ms.
Rawls. ``We can proceed from there and see how best the problem can
be handled.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is
dispatching his top Middle East aide on a trip to Iraq and several

long-running Iran-Iraq war and discuss other issues, a State
Department official said today.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Richard
W. Murphy, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs, plans to visit Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and North Yemen for discussions on a
``whole range'' of issues.
   Under a policy on official visits to areas with a potential for

   The United States has been seeking an end to the seven-year-old
Iran-Iraq war through diplomacy, notably an effort to get the
United Nations to impose an arms embargo against Iran. The Soviet
Union and China have blocked implemenation of the weapons ban.
   The United States is also using its naval forces to protect
shipping in the Persian Gulf and has proposed the sale of arms to
Kuwait and other oil-rich countries seeking sophisticated weapons
for defense against spillover attacks.

<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama, exiled leader of the
Tibetan people, today recognized China's right to handle Tibet's
foreign affairs and maintain troops on Tibetan soil.
   The Dalai Lama proposed talks with China to make Tibet ``a
self-governing, democratic political entity ... in association with
the People's Republic of China (which) could remain responsible for
Tibet's foreign policy.''
   ``Until such a peace conference can be convened and
demilitarization and neutralization achieved, China could have the
right to maintain a restricted number of military installations in
Tibet,'' he said.
   His remarks were in a speech prepared for delivery to the
European Parliament. The speech subsequently was canceled because
of fears his appearance would offend the Chinese government, and
the Buddhist spiritual leader spoke with reporters after copies of
his speech were distributed.
   The Dalai Lama previously has made little mention of Chinese
interests in Tibet. He also neither accepted the Chinese military
presence in the remote territory nor recognized China's right to
handle its foreign affairs.
   In today's speech, he spoke both of ``accommodating China's own
interests'' in Tibet while re-establishing ``Tibet's separate
identity.''
   He also said the ``government of the People's Republic of China
could remain responsible for Tibet's foreign policy'' and that
``China could have the right to maintain a restricted number of
military installations in Tibet.''
   But he said the ultimate goal is a demilitarized Tibet, ``a
genuine sanctuary of peace.''
   China regards Tibet as a critical buffer zone between itself and
India, a traditional rival. Western estimates put the number of
Chinese soldiers in Tibet at tens of thousands.
   The Dalai Lama said he was ``well aware that many Tibetans will
be disappointed by the moderate stand'' these new ideas represent.
   But, he argued that such conciliation represents the ``most
realistic means'' for restoring ``the fundamental rights of the
Tibetan people.''
   China claims Tibet has been part of its empire for more than six
centuries. Tibetan activists say Tibet is an independent country
and point to its separate language, culture and traditions as proof.
   Communist troops entered Tibet after defeating Nationalist
Chinese forces in 1949.
   Ten years later, Tibetan activists rebelled against Chinese
rule. The Chinese army crushed the uprising and the Dalai Lama fled
to India with thousands of other Tibetans.
   During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, bands of Chinese
radicals, called Red Guards, destroyed most of Tibet's Buddhist
temples and killed monks.
   After the fall of the ultra-leftist Gang of Four, conditions in
Tibet improved and the state began putting more money into the
region.
   But the improved conditions also led to increased expectations
by the Tibetan people.
   Tibet has been rocked by two major anti-Chinese protests _ both
in Lhasa, the capital. The protests, which occurred last fall and
again in March, left dozens of Tibetans and Chinese dead.
   Hundreds of Tibetan monks who led the rebellion were reportedly
arrested.
   The Dalai Lama was to speak to the European Parliament, but the
invitation was withdrawn. He had been invited by Lady Elles, a
British Conservative.
   Lord Plumb, the parliament president, said he did ``not believe
that the Dalai Lama's visit is helpful in the current circumstances
of the European Parliament's improving relations with China.''
   Sources said Plumb, who is to visit China in July, feared a
formal speech to the parliament by the Dalai Lama would jeopardize
Plumb's visit to China.
   In October, the parliament urged China to respect Tibet's right
to self-determination and invited the Dalai Lama to address the
518-member parliament. Beijing then canceled a visit to China this
year by a parliamentary delegation.
   The Dalai Lama is in the middle of a 16-day tour of Europe. On
Tuesday, he met with Pope John Paul II.

   This is what some newspapers and commentators abroad had to say
recently about Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis
as they prepared to run against each other in November's
presidential election:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Le Monde of Paris (independent): ``The governor and the vice
president, despite long public careers, remain largely unknown,
vaguely perceived by public opinion. They have taken care not to
show their cards too soon, to make commitments on nothing or almost
nothing. The technique has been shown shown to pay off for the
primaries, particularly for Mr. Dukakis, who did not have any
particular advantage at the start over his Democratic competitors,
while the vice president, loyal aide to Mr. Reagan, started several
lengths in front in his race. ...
   ``The qualities needed to succeed in this kind of contest are
not necessarily sufficient to make a good president, but it is true
that the system has worked, while many in the Democratic camp
feared that it might get stuck.
   ``Weren't they talking last autumn about the `Seven Dwarfs,'
these seven Democratic candidates of whom none seemed to have the
makings of a president, or even of a credible candidate? ...
   ``Snow White has fallen in love with the smallest of the dwarfs,
who has grown up a great deal in the meanwhile. To the point that
he his more than 10 points ahead of his Republican opponent in the
polls, and has increased his self-confidence while benefiting from
a very favorable treatment from the media, especially television.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHILE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _El Mercurio of Santiago (conservative): ``Dukakis has no
experience in interntional policy. Bush _ as the second man in the
present administration _ is tied to the painful affair of the sale
of arms to Iran and to an ineffective policy in Central America.
Dukakis is prepared to suspend the aid to the Nicaraguan
anti-Sandinistas (which has already been done by Congress, against
Reagan's will), and supports Costa Rican President Oscar Arias'
peace plan for Central America, which has in effect meant leaving
everything unchanged, with the Sandinistas firmly in power''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Mainichi Daily News of Tokyo (conservative, English-language):
``For Japan, which has close relations with the United States in
the political and economic phases, the `greatest vigilance' is
required every four years.
   ``During the first half of the primaries, Japan's political and
economic circles exercised strong vigilance because of the
appearance of the `Gephardt phenomenon' that included the spread of
a protectionist feeling in the grass roots and the trend toward
`Japan bashing.' Fortunately, a wiser choice was later made by the
Americans and strong support was obtained by Bush and Dukakis who
are both anti-protectionist. ...
   ``Hitherto, both Bush and Dukakis have given careful attention
to Japan. ...
   ``From now on, it will be necessary for the two candidates to
draw up their respective party platforms in advancing toward the
presidential election. It will be necessary to watch the definite
form that the policy toward Japan will take. ...
   ``Since this is an election in another country, Japan can only
watch and wait.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (independent): ``The Reagan presidency has
meant stability for NATO. ...
   ``Would a Dukakis presidency bring fundamental change? ...
Unlike the current president, he says he would always consult his
allies before doing anything. ...
   ``That is rather like preaching motherhood and apple pie. ...
   ``He may discover ... if he becomes president that consensus
among the allies can be elusive. His commitment to consult the
Europeans will be popular in ... NATO capitals ... but a president
who is loath to act alone may then find it impossible to do
anything. ...
   ``But Europe too must adjust in time if Mr. Dukakis wins. ... At
present, he seems dedicated to retaining American troops in Western
Europe, but that commitment may be less firm when subjected to
political pressures within America. ... The old issue of
burden-sharing is once more alive. ... Europeans should prepare to
be cooperative if they want to keep the alliance strong in what
could be an era of change and readjustment. ...
   ``The ... need to respond to new perceptions in America must be
impressed upon allied governments.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANADA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Maclean's (national weekly newsmagazine): ``If Dukakis ... wins
the November election, Canadians may have the most sympathetic
incumbent in history in the White House. Dukakis has taken a
leading role on issues high on Ottawa's agenda _ urging strict
federal emission controls to reduce acid rain and speaking out in
favor of the Canadian-U.S. free trade agreement.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Bill Fox, political columnist Toronto Star, on Jesse Jackson:
``Jackson knows his dream of being the first black American elected
to the highest office in the land will not be realized in 1988. ..
. But even as Dukakis moves inexorably towards the Democratic Party
nomination, it is vital that Jackson keep running: vital to the
Democrats, even more vital to democracy in America.
   ``Jackson strikes a responsive chord with the Vietnam veteran
without work, the single mother in the inner city, people who sweat
on the job. ... If Jackson's candidacy rekindles a commitment to
the democratic process by those who have questioned its worth of
late, then Jesse Jackson will be a winner, wherever he finishes in
the presidential race.''

   Two teen-agers who claimed they were injured
by a special effects explosion during a concert by the heavy metal
rock group Motley Crue have accepted at least $175,000 to settle
their suit, a lawyer said.
   Jim Corder, a lawyer for one of the teen-agers, said Tuesday the
band's insurer, Fireman's Fund, reached the settlement with Robbie
Miller, 17, of Athens, who lost an eye, and David Wright, 19, of
Grant, who suffered facial cuts.
   The two said they injured by dry ice or other debris that flew
from the stage during the band's 1986 ``Theater of Pain'' concert
in Huntsville.
   Corder said the agreement stipulated that the amount not be made
public. He said only that it was larger than the previous Limestone
County record of $175,000 and that most of it will go to Miller.
   The two had asked for about $1.2 million in damages. The case
went to trial earlier this year but ended in a mistrial with a
deadlocked jury.

<HEAD>Court Expands Liability of Business Promoters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today expanded the financial
liability of promoters of business deals that turn sour.
   The justices, voting 7-1, ruled that a Texas oilman may not have
to bear full financial liability for selling unregistered oil and
gas leases. The court said a promoter of the deal, who also bought
the securities himself, may be forced to share liability.
   The court overturned a ruling that favored the promoter and
ordered further lower court study of the case.
   Today's ruling also favors the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which argued that promoters who are not themselves
sellers of securities should not be immune from penalties in such
cases.
   The ruling is at least a partial victory for Billy ``B.J.''
Pinter, head of Black Gold Oil Co., who sold oil and gas rights in
Texas and Oklahoma to a group of investors in 1981.
   Maurice Dahl, a California real estate broker, was instrumental
in putting the deal together. Dahl was convinced the leases would
be lucrative and promoted their sale to his friends and family
members.
   When the leases proved worthless, the investors _ including Dahl
_ sued Pinter.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1986 that Pinter
violated federal law by failing to register the securities. The
appeals court upheld a federal judge's ruling that Pinter must
reimburse the investors for their losses plus interest.
   Pinter said that Dahl, because he promoted the investment, is
himself a ``seller'' of securities who should be forced to share
the cost of reimbursement.
   The 5th Circuit court, noting that Dahl did not receive a
commission for promoting the deal, said he was more a buyer than a
seller.
   But the Supreme Court today ordered further hearings to explore
that issue.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said it is
unclear ``whether Dahl urged the other purchases in order to
further some financial interest of his own or of Pinter.''
   Moreover, Blackmun said, there must be further study to
determine ``whether Dahl bears at least substantially equal
responsibility for the failure to register the oil and gas
interests or to distribute the securities in a manner that
conformed'' with federal law.
   There is conflicting evidence about the nature of Dahl's role,
Blackmun said.
   He said there is evidence, on one hand, that Dahl initiated the
entire investment and loaned money to Pinter to make the deal
possible, but on the other hand there is also evidence that Dahl
invested more money in the deal than other investors whom he urged
to participate.
   A person in Dahl's position must share financial liability for
sale of unregistered securities if his role ``is more as a promoter
than as an investor,'' Blackmun said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens was the lone dissenter. Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the case.
   The case is Pinter vs. Dahl, 86-805.

<TEXT>
   The maker of the Suzuki Samurai knew the
sporty vehicles were unsafe but sold them anyway, a class-action
lawsuit charges.
   The federal suit filed Tuesday charges Suzuki conspired to
conceal the Samurai's instability in violation of the Racketeering
Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act, a statute often employed
against organized crime.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said June 2 that
the Samurai rolls over in sudden turns at less than 40 mph and
should be banned. The $8,500 Samurai was the first car in a decade
to get a not-acceptable rating from the magazine.
   The suit, filed by Dr. Harold Kay of Wynnewood, Pa., on behalf
of all Samurai owners, contends that Suzuki and the companies
handling its public relations and advertising knew the vehicles
were ``by design and construction dangerous'' and that
``advertising and other sales representations were false and
misleading.''
   It seeks unspecified damages.
   Laura Segall, spokeswoman for Suzuki and an employee of the
defendant public relations firm Rogers and Associates, said
Tuesday, ``The bottom line we've said for the last 10 days is that
it's safe and stable.''
   The manufacturer said the the Samurai was thoroughly tested for
safety, stability and handling before it was introduced in the
United States in November 1985. Suzuki sold 154,675 Samurais
through April.
   In addition to the Consumers Union claims, the suit points to
the Center for Auto Safety's February petition to the government to
order a recall.
   It also cites National Traffic Highway Safety Administration
figures that at least 44 Samurai rollover accidents resulted in at
least 53 injuries and 16 deaths.

   The Supreme Court, barring Arizona prosecutors
from using an accused burglar's confession as evidence against him,
refused to narrow criminal suspects' so-called Miranda rights today.
   By a 6-2 vote, the court said police may not question a suspect
who already has invoked his right to remain silent or receive a
lawyer's help, even if their questions center on some other crime.
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said Tucson
police in 1985 violated Ronald W. Roberson's rights by questioning
him about a burglary after he had refused to discuss another
burglary until conferring with a lawyer.
   The court, in its landmark 1966 decision in a case called
Miranda vs. Arizona, ruled that criminal suspects in police custody
must be told about their right to remain silent, to have a lawyer's
help, and to have a lawyer appointed for them if they cannot afford
one.
   In other action today, the court expanded the financial
liability of promoters of business deals that turn sour and limited
the CIA's authority to fire employees without having to face court
review.
   The justices ruled 7-1 that California real estate broker
Maurice Dahl may have to share liability with Texas oil man Billy
``B.J.'' Pinter, who a federal appeals court said violated federal
law by failing to register securities in a oil and gas rights deal
that collapsed. Dahl had promoted the deal and bought into it
himself.
   In the CIA case, the court ruled 6-1 that the CIA director does
not have blanket discretion to fire employees. The case involved a
homosexual identified in court documents only as John Doe. The man
was fired by then-CIA Director William Casey in 1982.
   The agency claimed his homosexuality was a security threat, but
a federal appeals court ruled he could only be fired if he was
found to be a legitimate security threat, not just because he was
gay. Today's decision upholds that ruling and requires court review
of constitutional questions raised in firings by the agency.
   In the Arizona case, the court said that if suspects invoke
their right to silence or to have legal help, police questioning
must stop.
   In deciding a case called Edwards vs. Arizona in 1981, the
justices emphasized that police officers may not seek to initiate
any new contact with a suspect who already has asked to see a
lawyer.
   But Arizona Attorney General argued in Roberson's case that the
court's previous rulings should not apply when police, unaware of
the suspect's alleged participation in one crime, seek to question
him about another crime.
   The court rejected Corbin's argument.
   ``Whether a contemplated re-interrogation concerns the same or a
different offense, or whether the same or different law enforcement
authorities are involved in the second investigation, the same need
to determine whether the suspect has requested counsel exists,''
Stevens said.
   ``The police department's failure to honor that request cannot
be justified by the lack of diligence of a particular officer,'' he
added.
   Roberson had been arrested by Tucson police on burglary charges
when police detective Jerry Cota-Robles learned of information
suggesting that Roberson may have participated in an April 15, 1985
burglary.
   Cota-Robles went to question Roberson about the April 15
burglary, but was not told that Roberson previously had invoked his
right to see a lawyer before answering police questions.
   Cota-Robles warned Roberson about his rights and questioned him.
Roberson confessed to the April 15 burglary.
   Arizona courts refused to let the confession be introduced as
trial evidence, and prosecutors dismissed the case while appealed
the decision to suppress the evidence.
   The state court rulings were upheld in today's decision.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy dissented. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate
in the case for unannounced reasons.
   The case is Arizona vs. Roberson, 87-354.

or tied temperature records in 34 cities from Portland, Ore., to
Portland, Maine.
   However, most areas had only a trace of rain and reports of more
than a tenth of an inch were rare, the National Weather Service
said.
   Another hot day was under way in the Northeast, and a long list
of record temperatures was expected. By 10 a.m. today, Boston
registered 89 degrees, and the temperature was expected to hit 96
this afternoon.
   In contrast, the temperature at Deerfield Lake, S.D., in the
Black Hills dropped to a crisp 30 this morning.
   Rain fell over Wisconsin, southeastern Nebraska and central
Kansas. Northwest Texas, eastern New Mexico and eastern Colorado
had scattered showers and thundershowers.
   Heavier rain fell in Wisconsin, eastern Kansas and eastern
portions of New Mexico and Colorado.
   A half-inch of rain fell in Axtell in northeast Kansas and
four-tenths of an inch in Manhattan. Fairfax, Wis., had nine-tenths
of an inch. Las Vegas, N.M., had slightly more than an inch of
rain; Wheatridge and La Junta, Colo., recorded 1{ inches and more
than half an inch during the six hours ending at 6 a.m. EDT.
   In eastern Colorado, a thunderstorm dropped up to 2 inches of
small hail near Hartsel.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the country, with clear
skies from the Gulf Coast to the Atlantic Coast and in the
north-central United States.
   On Tuesday night, severe thunderstorms swept through the upper
Mississippi Valley. In southeast Minnesota, the storms generated
winds gusting to 60 mph, downing power lines in the Pine Island and
Zumbro Falls area, and small hail which did some crop damage in
Owatonna. High winds downed trees in four northern Wisconsin
counties.
   Tuesday's hot weather broke temperature records for June 14 in
27 cities and tied them in seven cities in the Northeast, Midwest
and West.
   It was 94 degrees in Pittsburgh, where the old mark of 93 was
set in 1885. In Washington, D.C., the 103-year-old record of 94
degrees was tied. Alpena, Mich., reported a sweltering 98 degrees,
4 degrees over last year's record.
   It was 89 degrees in Portland, Ore., 1 degree over the 1961 mark
and a record-tying 84 degrees in Portland, Maine.
   Other cities experiencing record temperatures included
Baltimore, Philadelphia; Beckley, W.Va.; Providence, R.I.;
Burlington, Vt.; Cleveland; Detroit; Marquette, Mich.; and Seattle.
   While not a record, the nation's high Tuesday was 110 degrees in
Bullhead City, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in
southern and central Florida, from northwest Indiana to Illinois
and Missouri, over central Colorado and scattered widely over
northeast Minnesota and northern Nevada.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 60s and 70s from Upper
Michighan to northern Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, western
Nebraska and northeast Colorado, along the northern Pacific Coast
and along much of the California coast; the 80s and 90s in much of
the rest of the nation; and 100 to 110 degrees in the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Custer and Redig, S.D., to 89 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Carlucci Will Require Contractors' Workplaces to be Drug-Free</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said today
he intends to require Pentagon contractors to provide ``a drug-free
workplace'' for their 3.2 million employees.
   The contractors would have to develop extensive anti-drug
programs, including mandatory testing of employees with security
clearances, Carlucci told the Senate and House Armed Services
committees.
   Carlucci's announcement came as he said he is opposed to a pair
of House and Senate bills providing extensive new involvement of
the military in the fight against illegal drug shipments into the
United States.
   The hundreds of defense contractors would have to educate their
workers about the dangers of drugs and would also have to test for
drug usage, Carlucci told the two panels.
   An estimated 3 million workers on Pentagon contracts have
security clearances and thus would be subject to the testing
program.
   Carlucci said ``it would be my intent to issue'' the regulation
requiring the anti-drug effort, but did not say when that order
would be made.
   The two panels are working on a compromise version of a Pentagon
budget bill and some of the key proposals involve the military's
role in the anti-drug fight.
   The House overwhelmingly approved a proposal essentially
requiring President Reagan to have the military seal the U.S.
borders against drug smugglers, while the Senate easily passed a
measure giving the military new powers, including the authority to
arrest drug smugglers in international waters.
   ``None of the interdiction approaches, in and of themselves,
will work,'' Carlucci said. ``I believe that these are not
solutions to the problem, but rather the result of our rising
frustration at our inability to find a real solution.''
   ``I remain absolutely opposed to the assignment of a law
enforcement mission to the Department of Defense,'' Carlucci said.
``I am even more firmly opposed to any relaxation of the posse
comitatus restrictions on the use of the military to search, seize
and arrest.''
   ``I have discussed this matter with the president and other
senior members of his Cabinet and I can report that these views are
shared throughout this administration,'' he said.
   Carlucci was referring to the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law
that bars the military from enforcing civilian laws. Congress
amended the law in 1981 to permit the military to take a limited
role in the anti-drug effort, but the current proposals would
provide new exemptions to the law.
   ``Our armed forces should not become a police force, nor can we
afford to degrade readiness by diverting badly needed resources
from their assigned missions,'' Carlucci said.
   ``The military is trained and equipped to shoot everything which
comes over the hill,'' he said in answer to a question. ``They're
not trained and equipped to distinguish the good guys from the bad
guys. ... they are trained and equipped with weapons of mass
destruction.''

   A nursing home resident with gangrene
has the right to refuse a leg amputation that could save his life,
a county judge ruled.
   William H. Lawrence, 85, is competent to decide his medical
care, Vanderburgh Superior Court Judge Robert W. Lensing said
Tuesday.
   Doctors say Lawrence's left leg must be removed to prevent
gangrene from fatally poisoning his blood. The man is nearly deaf
and has difficulty speaking sometimes but remains alert, his
attorney and workers at the nursing home said.
   Lawrence has a niece in Indianapolis but she has not chosen to

   A newborn whale that beached itself with
its mother near Patrick Air Force Base was reported holding its own
Wednesday at Sea World marine park.
   Animal handlers were administering fluids and trying to keep the
2-foot calf stabilized.
   Survival chances are historically low for the pgymy sperm whale
species. ``A calf separated from its mother is an even more
critical problem,'' said Jack Pearson, Sea World's curator of
mammals.
   Passers-by spotted the calf swimming about 500 yards south of
its beached mother on Tuesday off the base, south of Cocoa Beach.
   ``The calf still had afterbirth and blood on it when I got
here,'' said Robert Fransisco, an Air Force structural technician
who held the calf in the surf for four hours. ``The mother was
really bleeding, too.''
   The mother's body was brought to Sea World to try to determine
the cause of death.

<TEXT>
   Scientists say they have developed forms of
insulin that are absorbed more quickly after injection than current
versions, holding promise of better treatment for diabetics.
   Experiments in pigs showed the new forms are absorbed two to
three times faster after injection than current rapid-acting
insulins, researchers said.
   That means they can better match the rapid rise in bloodstream
concentrations that non-diabetics get in response to eating a meal,
researchers from Denmark and Britain wrote in Thursday's issue of
the British journal Nature.
   The work already has led to improved control of blood sugar
levels in some diabetics, but the new insulins must be studied for
possible side effects before their usefulness can be established,
the scientists said.
   To develop the new forms, researchers altered tiny portions of
the standard insulin molecule to prevent molecules from clumping
together.

<HEAD>Manigat Rescinds Army Order To Transfer Colonel Indicted For Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Leslie Manigat today
halted the transfer of high-ranking military officials, saying the
action was needed to ``avoid a major crisis'' in the country.
   Manigat rescinded an order by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, army chief
of staff, for the transfers or retirements of certain military
leaders.
   Private radio station Haiti Inter reported Col. Jean-Claude
Paul, indicted for drug trafficking earlier this year by a grand
jury in Miami, had been relieved of his command as head of the
notorious Dessalines Army Barracks.
   The station, which quoted an unidentified military source, said
Paul had been made assistant chief of staff, a largely
administrative position.
   The source said Paul spent the night, as usual, in the
Dessalines Barracks, the radio station said.
   Soldiers from the Dessalines Barracks under Paul's command have
been blamed for widespread violence that forced the cancellation of
general elections in Haiti last November and left more than 30
people dead.
   Manigat's order was made public today in an official communique
from the National Palace signed by the president and read over the
radio.
   The statement said ``the transfer and retirement of certain
high-ranking officers and other officers decided Tuesday morning by
the commander-in-chief'' had been rescinded to ``avoid a major
crisis.'' The president ``orders a return to the former status
quo,'' the statement said.
   Namphy, the former head of the junta that ruled Haiti after
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled in February 1986, is chief of
the armed forces.
   Paul was accused in March of conspiring to import 100 kilograms
of cocaine into the United States in December 1986. The indictment
said the traffickers used a landing strip on Paul's farm 90 miles
outside the capital, Port-au-Prince, to load and fly the shipment
to the Bahamas.
   Tuesday afternoon, as rumors of Paul's transfer spread, many
street vendors packed up early and a number of shops closed their
doors, radio stations said. In the evening more private vehicles
than usual were seached and extra military patrols were noted on
the main arteries.

<TEXT>
   Italy's highest criminal court ruled that
Swiss businessman Walter Demuth can be extradited to the United
States, where he is wanted on arms trafficking charges, his lawyer
said Wednesday.
   Following the ruling by the Court of Cassation last week,
Demuth's lawyer, Aldo Perla, said he did not know when the
businessman will be extradited.
   U.S. judicial authorities in New York issued a warrant for
Demuth in 1986 charging him with illegal commerce of military
materials and defrauding the American government. He was arrested
in Italy in September.
   Demuth, 63, was head of a Swiss company, Helitrade AG, that
deals in arms and civilian aircraft.
   Last year, the Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick linked Demuth to
arms dealing with Iran. The paper said Helitrade tried to ship
1,250 TOW anti-tank missiles falsely described as forklifts to
Tehran for $7.5 million.
   Demuth was quoted as saying that the deal was never completed.

   Police found 385 pounds of cocaine hidden in cases

   Bernart Gravet, head of the French anti-drug squad, said the $10
million worth of cocaine was found Monday during a raid on a
northern Paris warehouse.
   It was the largest seizure of cocaine this year in France.
   Gravet said the raid occurred while a shipment of 17,500 cans of
pineapple was being unloaded at the warehouse. Police found that
460 of the cans contained plastic envelopes of cocaine instead of
canned pineapple.
   He said the cocaine was intended for distribution in West
Germany, Britain and the Netherlands as well as in France.

<HEAD>Poll: AIDS Most Serious Health Problem, More U.S. Action Favored</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans view AIDS as the nation's most
serious health problem, and a majority favor mandatory testing for
the virus as well as more spending on education and research,
according to a poll released Wednesday.
   The survey for the American Association of Blood Banks said
people generally believe the blood supply is safer today than five
years ago, although nearly half _ 48 percent _ still think it is
likely AIDS could be contracted through a blood transfusion.
   Half of those questioned supported making every effort to
protect the blood supply, even at the risk of much higher blood
costs or blood shortages. But officials cautioned against thinking
that all risk could be eliminated.
   ``We are concerned that Americans believe it is possible to have
a `zero risk blood supply,''' said Dr. Paul J. Schmidt, AABB
president. ``Because blood is a human tissue, it will never be
`zero risk.'''
   The telephone survey of 1,000 people selected at random was
conducted by the polling firm of Hamilton, Frederick and Schneiders
on April 19 and May 1. The margin of error was plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   Forty-eight percent said acquired immune deficiency syndrome was
the ``most serious health problem facing the country today,''
compared with 35 percent in a prior AABB survey in December 1986.
Forty-six percent said cancer was the most serious concern,
compared with 52 percent in 1986.
   Ninety-five percent favored a nationwide AIDS education program,
and 84 percent supported increasing government spending
significantly for AIDS research, even if that would cause increased
taxes or cuts in key programs.
   Seventy-eight percent favored mandatory testing for drug users,
homosexuals and prostitutes; 78 percent favored it for couples
applying for marriage licenses; and 75 percent favored mandatory
testing for employees such as health professionals, teachers and
food service workers.
   The American Association of Blood Banks is a professional
society which includes 2,400 hospital blood banks, transfusion
services and community blood centers which collect nearly half the
nation's blood supply and transfuse more than 80 percent of the
blood collected in the United States.

   Jesse Jackson said today his ``most critical''
political concern is to have the Democratic convention accept his
budget priorities, which include increasing taxes and freezing
military spending to pay for social programs.
   Now that Michael Dukakis' camp has agreed to his platform
position on South Africa, Jackson indicated he will home in on his
budget arguments.
   ``The most critical becomes this budget, a commitment to invest
in people, a commitment to reinvest in America,'' Jackson said
following a meeting with leaders of civil rights groups.
   He said Dukakis talks of helping people but has made ``far too
little commitment to offset the impact of Reagan's shortfall in
investment in urban America.''
   ``Now putting forth a commitment to dream a new dream, to choose
hope over dope, and pay for our dreams will be central to our
thrust at the platform hearings and in Atlanta.''
   Jackson has proposed a freeze on military spending and raising
taxes on the wealthy and corporations to pay for his proposals, but
the Dukakis forces have rejected those two ideas.
   He said he urged the black leaders, meeting at the invitation of
the Black Leadership Forum, to meet with Dukakis. Benjamin Hooks,
head of the NAACP, said they would seek such a meeting and would
voice concerns about budget priorities.
   Jackson also said the idea of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a proposal endorsed by Dukakis, would
be ``a fatal mistake'' if done outside the context of a negotiated
peace plan. He said such a move would ``create more chaos.''
   On Tuesday, Jackson repeated his contention that he ought to be
a contender for the No. 2 spot on the ticket, although he's still
not saying whether he'd accept it if an offer were extended.
   ``I have earned, my constituency has earned, consideration to be
on the ticket,'' Jackson said during a news conference following a
speech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Salt Lake City.
   Recent polls have indicated that having Jackson on the ticket
would hurt Dukakis more than it would help, but he brushed that
suggestion aside.
   ``Our combined efforts could very well bring victory,'' he said.
   Despite all the talk about the vice presidency, Jackson said he
was still not willing to concede the nomination to Dukakis. The
Massachusetts governor has more than enough delegates to win the
nomination on the first ballot at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta next month.
   ``My priority at this point is to seek the nomination,'' Jackson
insisted.
   Jackson also termed weekend Democratic platform-drafting
meetings on Macincac Island, Mich., a ``step in the right
direction'' toward resolving platform differences between him and
Dukakis.
   ``They established a framework for negotiation,'' he said.
   In his speech to the mayors, Jackson said he did much to set the
agenda for the presidential campaign.
   ``The present focus on human rights, drugs and, now, South
Africa, ratifies my leadership,'' he said.
   Jackson repeated his call for a military spending freeze, and
proposed financing small business loans and low-income housing with
securities purchased by public pension funds.

   President Reagan has nominated Maj. Gen.
Gordon E. Fornell, the Air Force general who serves as the top
military aide to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, for a
promotion and new assignment, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate, Fornell will receive a
third star and the rank of lieutenant general and become the next
chief of the electronic systems division of the Air Force Systems
Command _ a position with important contracting responsibilities.
   Fornell, 51, is a native of Chicago.
   The Pentagon said Air Force Lt. Gen. Melvin F. Chubb Jr., who
holds the post now, planned to retire on Oct. 1 after more than 34
years of active-duty service.
   Chubb, 54, is a native of Joplin, Mo., who has held the
electronic systems division command since July 1984.

<HEAD>Agent `Flabbergasted' At Halting Of Drug Investigation</HEAD>

   An undercover agent testified today he was
``very flabbergasted'' that a secret investigation into widespread
drug trafficking was abruptly halted at a California nuclear
weapons laboratory before he could penetrate highly classified
areas.
   Detective Robert Buda said the undercover investigation was
terminated by Energy Department officials three days before he
received his ``green card'' clearance to pursue drug ring leaders
in the most sensitive areas of the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory near San Francisco.
   ``Unfortunately that door was closed before we could get in,''
he told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.
   A subcommittee report circulated before today's hearing said
more than 100 employees had been targeted in the investigation
known as Operation Snowstorm.
   The report said the investigation was halted in September 1986,
nine months after it began. David A. Leary, who was in charge of
the investigation, said that 127 suspects had been identified
before the investigation was terminated.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the investigation ``should be
called Operation Snowjob'' because Energy Department officials were
too afraid of adverse publicity to continue the drug investigation.
   The laboratory conducts top-secret research on nuclear weapons
and President Reagan's Star Wars missile defense system. Timothy L.
Mitchell of the laboratory's drug investigating team testified that
the volume of drug trafficking at Livermore ``has the potential to
endanger national security.''
   According to the subcommittee report, the drug investigation by
the laboratory's security department was halted by Lawrence
Livermore managers under pressure from Energy Department officials.
   The investigation began in January 1986 after an ``alarming
number'' of employees became involved in drug-related activities
and arrests. The report fails to specify the drugs, but a
subcommittee source told the Post that cocaine, methamphetamine and
marijuana were used during and after work hours.
   John Hunt, head of the security at the laboratory, told
investigators ``we would have to arrest 20 percent of the lab'' if
the operation were allowed to continue.

   President Kennedy was murdered in a plot by Texas
oilmen. The Red Army won World War II virtually alone. These and
other lies have fatally flawed Soviet textbooks, according to the
official media and educators.
   ``Huge, unmeasurable is the guilt of those who deluded
generation after generation, poisoning their minds and souls with
lies,'' the government daily Izvestia thundered recently in an
unusually strong attack on distortions and omissions in the
schoolbooks and on the authors who wrote them.
   History texts used by 45 million Soviet school pupils are so out
of tune with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost'' or
openness that 160 teams of authors have competed to write new
textbooks and this month's history exams have been canceled for
students in their 10th and final year of school.
   The written tests would have required 16- and 17-year-olds to
parrot material at odds with recent disclosures about the country's
past, including the misdeeds of dictator Josef Stalin.
   ``What Stalin did in the 1930s, all the illegal acts, are not
mentioned in the textbooks,'' said Igor A. Parabrin, editor of
international relations for the educational newspaper Uchitelskaya
Gazeta. ``There is a lack of information, a lack of truth, and
sometimes just plain lies.''
   For example, Parabrin said textbooks still depict Stalin's foes
such as Nikolai A. Bukharin as criminals or traitors, or do not
mention them at all. Bukharin, a top-ranking Bolshevik who was shot
in 1938 after being convicted on trumped-up charges of spying, was
judicially rehabilitated this year.
   The textbooks, even those printed as recently as 1986, spotlight
Soviet victory in World War II and the 1957 launch of the first
Sputnik, but avoid tragedies such as the 1934-38 Great Purge, in
which Western historians estimate at least 8 million people were
killed or sent to labor camp under Stalin.
   Here is a sampler from Soviet textbooks printed in the last
three years:
   _On Kennedy's assassination in 1963: ``International opinion
viewed this `crime of the century' as the deed of ultrarightists
linked to the CIA and FBI who were carrying out the will of the oil
magnates of Texas.''
   _On ``bourgeois lies'' about World War II: ``The falsifiers of
history try to decrease the significance of the victories of the
Red Army, to minimize the decisive role of the U.S.S.R. in the rout
of the Hitlerite bloc. At the same time, they exaggerate the
military successes of the Allies, the significance of the fighting
in the West.''
   _On the Soviet Union: ``Our country will become even richer,
even stronger, even more beautiful. Because the Soviet people under
the leadership of the party of Communists is working well and is
building a new, happy life. And that new and genuinely happy life
is communism!''
   Instead of the scheduled written exam, students finishing the
10th grade of Soviet school will be given oral tests.
   The decision to cancel the written exams was made in May by
Gennady A. Yagodin, chairman of the State Committee on Public
Education, a recently created superministry overseeing
government-mandated reforms in education.
   ``Canceling the exams was the only possible sober and honorable
decision,'' Izvestia said in its front-page article June 9.
``Everyone _ teachers, parents, students _ can feel only relief and
thanks toward those who had the boldness to say that these exams
would not take place.''
   Soviet educators, meanwhile, are moving to create a new
generation of textbooks that reflect the demands of glasnost.
   Vladimir Shadrikov, vice chairman of the education
superministry, told the Tass news agency that the goal was to move
away from the ``excessive uniformity'' that he said had plagued the
Soviet educational system.
   Izvestia suggested that if new textbooks cannot be printed by
the beginning of the next school year in September, intellectuals
could compile anthologies of published glasnost-era historical
writings and documents for classroom use.
   At some Moscow-area schools, teachers for months have begun
basing their history lessons on articles in the weekly Ogonyok, the
tabloid Moscow News and other publications campaigning for more
historical candor.
   ``Today we are reaping the fruits of our own moral compromising
... for silently encouraging everything for which we blush today
and about which we do not know know how to answer our children,''
Izvestia said.
   ``Let us teach them in such a way that when they become parents,
they will not have to blush before our grandchildren.''

<HEAD>Gallup Poll Points To Dukakis Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis maintained a double-digit lead over Republican George Bush
in a new Gallup poll, a larger margin than his advantage in two
other recent public opinion surveys.
   The poll, conducted by Gallup for the Boston Globe, radio
station WEEI and WCVB-TV of Boston, found 52 percent support for
Dukakis and 38 percent for Bush. The same poll a month ago gave
Dukakis his greatest lead, 54-38.
   Another opinion poll in May gave Dukakis a double-digit lead, 10
points in a CBS News-New York Times survey. Two more recent polls
had single-digit leads for Dukakis, 49-44 in a Harris poll
conducted June 1-6 and 45-39 in a USA Today-CNN poll June 7-9.
   The Gallup poll released Tuesday, which was conducted June 10-12
among 1,005 registered voters, had a margin of sampling error of
four percentage points.

<HEAD>Gore to Endorse Michael Dukakis This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. will endorse Michael
Dukakis for president at a news conference in Nashville, Tenn., on
Thursday, an aide says.
   The Tennessee senator, who ended his bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination after the New York primary in April, was
the only former Dukakis rival who had not yet backed the
Massachusetts governor.
   Mike Kopp, Gore's press secretary, said Tuesday the senator
would fly to Boston today and accompany Dukakis to Tennessee on
Wednesday.
   Before going to Boston, Gore was meeting in his Senate office
with Jesse Jackson. While Jackson remains technically in the race,
Dukakis has more than the 2,081 delegates needed for a majority at
the Democratic National Convention in July.
   Kopp said Gore would urge his delegates to back Dukakis. The
Associated Press delegate survey has shown a large number of Gore
delegates already making that choice. In recent weeks, 114
delegates elected as Gore supporters have switched to Dukakis. As
of Tuesday, Gore still had 289 delegates.

<HEAD>Court Gives Independent Candidate Place On Michigan Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials were trying to assess the
impact of a judge's ruling that an independent presidential
candidate deserves a place on the Michigan ballot without having to
submit petition signatures.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Demascio ruled Monday in Detroit that
Lenora Fulani should have a place on the November ballot without
having to submit 24,000 petition signatures.
   The judge ruled it was unconstitutional to apply to Fulani a new
law requiring independent candidates to gather the signatures. The
law says the signatures have to be collected no more than 180 days
before the filing deadline. But the law didn't take effect until 81
days before this year's deadline of July 21.
   ``We maintain that's enough time for a bona fide candidate to
collect 24,000 signatures,'' said Elections Director Christopher
Thomas.
   Since Fulani was the only party to the lawsuit, it's unclear
whether the judge's ruling will apply to other would-be independent
candidates, he said.
   Fulani, 38, of New York, was an unsuccessful gubernatorial
candidate in 1986 and mayoral candidate in 1985. A psychologist,
she is the former director of the Harlem Institute for Social
Therapy and Research.

<HEAD>Traditional Roll Call Will Survive Computerization At Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-by-state roll call _ the traditional
high point of a national party convention _ will go on as usual
despite Democrats' plans to use computers to tally some votes.
   The party's convention committee is working out the bugs in an
electronic voting system that will allow delegations, using small
computers on the floor, to vote on the party platform and
convention rules. Votes would be displayed on a big overhead screen
behind the podium. ``But we will still do the roll call for the
president and vice president in the traditional manner,'' said Ruth
Berry, a spokeswoman for the committee that is planning the July
18-21 convention in Atlanta.
   The state-by-state roll call, in which the head of each
delegation takes the floor to announce the state's votes, ``is a
long-standing tradition,'' she said. ``It's something people expect
and it adds excitement to the convention.''
   Several other high-tech features are being explored by the
convention committee, including the electronics to allow delegates
to send messages to other delegates on the floor, computer to
computer, she said.

<TEXT>
   Mississippi's welfare commissioner said
today he has moved his 13-year-old daughter out of state because of
kidnapping threats prompted by the state's closing of a Baptist
boarding school for troubled youngsters.
   The independent home was closed Friday amid allegations of child
abuse and neglect.
   Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain said he and his family have
been threatened, ``my daughter specifically, in terms of taking her
away to one of those homes.''
   He said there had been ``threats of kidnapping and putting her
in a home where she would never be found again.''
   The threats were made over the telephone, Brittain said. He
would not elaborate.
   Brittain's 21-year-old son, Thomas Brittain III, contacted at
the Brittains' home in Jackson, said his parents had moved his
sister, Brandi, out of state because of threats on her life.
   ``I'm big enough to take care of myself,'' the younger Brittain
said.
   On Friday, Youth Court Judge Robert Oswald ordered all residents
of the unlicensed Bethel Home for Children temporarily placed in
state custody. He ruled that the children, ages 10 to 17, had been
subjected ``to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention
amounting to imprisonment.''
   Before state welfare officials arrived, most of the children
fled. An estimated 60 still are missing. Since Friday, the state
has taken 77 other children from the home, releasing about 50 to
their parents so far.
   The state has required that parents or guardians wanting to
regain custody, must promise not to send the children back to
Bethel.
   The operator of the fundamentalist school, the Rev. Herman
Fountain, has been jailed on $40,000 bail on charges of scuffling
officers who tried to take custody of children.
   Diciplinary measures at the school have come under fire since
1980.
   Fountain, in an interview, said that no more than 10 licks with
a switch were allowed and that other punishments permitted were
running laps _ no more than 25 _ and making students write
sentences over and over on the blackboard.
   He said the investigation of the home was prompted by the
allegations of one runaway who claims he was abused. Fountain
added, ``He's a liar, and you'd know that too if you dealt with him
for five minutes.''

<HEAD>Contras Meet with Congressional Leaders On Aid</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: First 9 grafs new with White House meeting, Fitzwater quotes,
remarks from congressmen. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, House Speaker.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is weighing whether
to seek new U.S. military aid for the Nicaraguan Contra resistance
in the wake of collapsed peace talks with the Managua government, a
White House spokesman said today.
   Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the policy review includes
consultations with members of Congress and a fact-finding mission
to Central America by Max Kampelman, one of the administration's
key arms control negotiators.
   Fitzwater said the temporary reassignment of Kampelman to the
mission in Central America did not represent a downgrading of the
importance of negotiations on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START). Dispatching the veteran diplomat to El Salvador, Costa
Rica and Guatemala, he said, was done to get ``a fresh eye'' on the
problem.
   Fitzwater said that Reagan, in a meeting today with
congressional supporters of the Contras, expressed frustration that
the world was not being told enough about Sandinista excesses.
   ``The president said the Sandinistas want to talk about how to
lay down arms, but they do not want to talk about how to bring
democracy to Nicaragua,'' his spokesman said. ``He said they want
to talk about surrender but they do not want to talk about reform
and democracy.''
   ``The president listened to their various points of view. No
decisions were made. Everybody agreed that we need to be more
involved (in pushing the Contra cause),'' Fitzwater said of the
meeting. ``I can't say when we will have a decision.''
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., said he and other congressmen had
sought the meeting with Reagan out of a concern that the White
House had given up on the Contra issue after multiple setbacks
earlier this year in the House.
   ``It was necessary, I think, for some of us to point out that
with the Moscow summit and now the Toronto summit and a lot of
other things occupying the White House, that we thought it was
important that he keep the attention focused on Central America as
well,'' Edwards told reporters afterward. ``We have said that we
thought that more needed to be done to get leadership out of the
White House. ''
   Leaders of the Contra resistance were meeting with members of
Congress on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, to discuss the possibility of
a renewal of military aid for the rebels.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, issued a statement expressing
opposition to military assistance. House Republican leader Bob
Michel of Illinois, a longtime Contra supporter, indicated a
reluctance to renew the fight for military aid, suggesting that any
such proposal might face defeat.
   The failure of the peace talks produced vitriolic attacks by
Shultz against the Sandinistas on Tuesday and by Nicaraguan
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann on ``extremist elements'' within the
Contras and the Reagan administration.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, blaming the Sandinistas for
the breakdown of the talks, said their actions have shown the world
``that their promises of democratization have no counterpart in
concrete action.
   ``Their consistent and apparent goal has been to disarm and
eliminate the resistance so that they can proceed to consolidate
their rule in Nicaragua,'' Shultz said after meeting at the State
Department with the Contra leaders.
   ``Their kind of rule in Nicaragua will never be accepted as
legitimate by the United States. We will stick with the resistance
freedom fighters. Their cause of peace with freedom is the right
cause.''
   It was not clear what Shultz meant when he raised questions
about the legitimacy of the Sandinista government, because the
United States has always been represented in Managua by an
ambassador since the start of the 1979 revolution.
   Tunnermann, in a letter to Wright, said the Contras on the final
day of the talks ``introduced an entirely new set of demands'' and
insisted that the Sandinistas accept them all within two hours.
   ``There can be little doubt that the sole purpose of the
Contras' last-minute maneuvering was to insist on demands so
outlandish and unacceptable that our negotiators would be forced to
reject them,'' Tunnermann said.
   Still, Tunnermann and the Contras both left the door open to a
resumption of the negotiations and Shultz also indicated support
for such a solution. A cease-fire agreed to in late March is still
being observed although each side has accused the other of
violating it.
   The rebels were dealt a setback last February 3 when the House
defeated a proposal by Reagan for additional military aid. U.S.
assistance is now limited to humanitarian aid.
   The Contras share the Reagan administration's view that the loss
of military aid has robbed the rebels of leverage in their
negotiations with the Sandinistas. But the administration is wary
of seeking a new congressional vote on military assistance until
there is some evidence that majority support can be obtained.
   Reagan discussed the issue with GOP congressional leaders on
Tuesday, but no decisions were reached. Contra leader Adolfo Calero
has called for a resumption of military aid.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis was sounding law and order themes today
while Jesse Jackson talked about the budget and said he still
hadn't surrendered in the presidential battle. Republican George
Bush's camp said he hasn't decided what to cut to finance his $600
million educational incentive plan.
   Jackson, talking with leaders of black organizations in
Washington, said today the ``most critical'' policy item for him
now is moving the Democrats to his budget priorities, which include
increasing taxes on the wealthy and freezing defense spending to
pay for a variety of social programs.
   He told reporters he has no intention of joining the former
Democratic candidates who endorsed Dukakis after the Massachusetts
governor won enough delegates to clinch the nomination at next
month's convention. ``They lost and surrendered. I did not. We're
not in the same category,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas scouted in
Washington for potential Dukakis running mates.
   Campaign and congressional aides said Brountas would spend the
next few days consulting party leaders and others, including two
senators often mentioned as potential vice presidential candidates
_ John Glenn of Ohio and Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
   Bush, confronted with yet another poll giving Dukakis a
double-digit lead, gave no clues Tuesday when he was asked whether
retiring White House chief of staff Howard Baker might have a place
on his ticket.
   ``No talk about a vice president,'' Bush said. ``It's too
early.''
   Baker said in an interview that ``you don't turn down requests''
to be on the national ticket. But he said of running for vice
president, ``I do not want to do that, I do not expect to do that,
and I think it's extremely unlikely I would be asked to do that.''
   He said he had told Bush he was quitting but did not raise the
issue of whether he might be available as a running mate.
Laughingly, Baker added, ``More important, he's never discussed
that with me.''
   Bush's new campaign press secretary, Sheila Tate, was asked
today on CBS-TV about the ``gender gap,'' a reference to polls that
show the vice president with far more support among men than women.
   ``That seems to be a traditional Republican polling problem
which often disappears when you get close to an election,'' she
said. ``As the voters, male and female, focus after the
conventions, that gender gap as we call it will go away.''
   Dukakis on Tuesday continued his campaign on the drug issue,
meeting aboard an idled Coast Guard cutter in South Bedford, Mass.,
with members of a local drug task force.
   The vessel was idled because of a 55 percent cut in the Coast
Guard budget agreed upon by Congress and President Reagan. Dukakis
said the administration must bear most of the blame.
   ``Of course Congress shares the responsibility,'' he said. ``But
the leadership has to come from the White House.''
   Dukakis said that he would restore the Coast Guard funding if
elected, calling the agency the ``first line of defense'' against
drugs.
   Dukakis had meetings planned today with New York law enforcement
officials and with new state police recruits. He also planned to
meet with his anti-crime council and announce the latest additions
to the state's violent fugitives list.
   Bush on Tuesday laid a cornerstone of his plan to be ``the
education president,'' proposing a $500 million recognition program
with $100,000 awards for schools that improve the performance of
disadvantaged students.
   Bush also called for awarding states $1 million each for
``experimentation and innovation'' in areas such as merit pay for
teachers and year-round schools.
   ``Our program for the future must be built around a strategy of
investing in our children,'' Bush said.
   Charles W. Greenleaf Jr., Bush's domestic affairs adviser, said
the new proposals outlined on Tuesday are ``by no means all'' of
Bush's educational plans. Additional ones will be detailed this
summer, he said.
   Greenleaf said that the total $600 million pricetag would have
to be offset by savings in other areas under Bush's ``flexible
freeze'' proposal to hold overall federal spending to the rate of
inflation, but no decisions have been made on where those cuts
would be made.
   Bush has maintained an upbeat stance in the face of polls
suggesting he trails Dukakis.
   The latest of those, conducted by Gallup for the Boston Globe,
radio station WEEI and television station WCVB in Boston, found 52
percent support for Dukakis and 38 percent for Bush. Results of the
poll, conducted June 10-12 among 1,005 registered voters, had a
margin of error of four percentage points.
   ``I don't believe in polls at this time. I really don't,'' Bush
told reporters Tuesday.
   The presidential primary season came to its official end Tuesday
in North Dakota. For all practical purposes, it had ended a week
earlier with races in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and
Montana.
   Because of the late date, no Democrats bothered to file. On the
Republican side, Bush was opposed by Mary Jane Rachner, a retired
teacher who says the spirits of her late mother and grandmother
told her to run.
   With 16 GOP delegates at stake, Bush, who long ago wrapped up
the GOP nomination, was piling up 88 percent of the vote.

   L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean-Jones says
her decision to spend more than $500,000 seeking a Republican
congressional nomination may have backfired.
   Bean-Jones was defeated Tuesday by Edward S. O'Meara, an aide to
GOP Sen. William S. Cohen. Returns from 99 percent of the precincts
in southern Maine's 1st District showed O'Meara with 52 percent of
the vote and Bean-Jones, a businesswoman and conservative, with 48
percent.
   Bean-Jones, granddaughter of outdoors outfitter L.L. Bean, spent
more than $500,000 on her losing effort, more than $455,000 of it
from her own pocket. O'Meara, who credited his win to support by
Republican Party regulars, spent between $60,000 and $65,000, a
spokesman said.
   Bean-Jones said the spending gap became a dominant issue in the
campaign, and that her reliance on her wealth seemed to boomerang.
   ``That was the reason that a lot of people gave us as to why
they are supporting him,'' she said after conceding defeat.
Bean-Jones said voters ``are not very forgiving of heavy spending
in a campaign when it so outdistances a challenger.''
   O'Meara will face incumbent Democratic Rep. Joseph E. Brennan in
November. Brennan, a former two-term governor, was unopposed in his
party's primary.

   Minister of Culture Jack Lang on Wednesday named
Antoine Vitez to head the Comedie Francaise, France's premier
national theatre.
   Vitez, the 58-year-old former director of the national Chaillot
Theatre in Paris, replaces the former Comedie Francaise General

   In addition to running the Chaillot, Vitez, who speaks fluent

``Tartuffe'' in Moscow and ``The Triumph of Love'' at the popular
Piccolo Teatro in Milan. He is known for his knowledge of classic
theatre, the speciality of the Comedie Francaise.
   Established in 1680 by the royal decree of Louis XIV, the
Comedie Francaise had the sole right to perform plays in French in
Paris until the French Revolution in 1789. It remains the nation's
great protector and promoter of French classics by playwrights such
as Moliere and and Racine.

<HEAD>Communist Party Paper Celebrates 40th Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The People's Daily, the Communist Party
newspaper, celebrated its 40th birthday on Wednesday with
front-page tributes from top Chinese leaders, including party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   The paper has been the leading communicator of the party line
since its first edition was issued June 15, 1948.
   Its stolid gray pages have signaled to Chinese and the outside
world key developments such as the rise of the cult of Mao
Tse-tung, the start of the far leftist Cultural Revolution in 1966
and its end in 1976 with the arrest of Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and
her fellow radicals.
   ``I hope you will enthusiastically and steadily carry out media
reform ... Constantly blazing new trails, and make the People's
Daily a paper that is warmly received by the masses,'' Zhao wrote
in a front-page-message.
   The anniversary edition carried a picture of the first edition's
front page with the lead headline: ``North China Liberated Area
Formally Organized.''
   One of the paper's most famous headlines appeared on June 1,
1966: ``Sweep Away All Ghosts And Monsters.'' The command,
appearing at the top of an editorial written by top government
officials, was one of the Cultural Revolution's first salvos
against alleged bourgeois and reactionary elements.
   A few days later, the People's Daily announced the dismissal of
Peng Zhen, head of the powerful Beijing Communist Party Committee,
signaling that rank would be no protection from attack in the
coming political storm.
   Recently the paper has conveyed official warnings that unity and
public order must be maintained if rapid economic development is to
be achieved.
   In the anniversary editorial, it reiterated that recent sharp
jumps in the prices of foodstuffs and other goods, which have
triggered widespread public discontent, are necessary to the
country's economic revitalization program.

started to loose power 39 seconds after takeoff, according to a
transcript of cockpit exchanges released Wednesday.
   Nineteen of the 40 passengers aboard the de Haviland Dash 8
plane were injured. There were no fatalities.
   During the six minutes after takeoff, problems mounted as a fire
erupted in the commuter plane's right engine; lights that indicate
whether the landing gear was down failed, and three seconds after
touchdown the crew realized they had lost steering.
   ``I can't steer this (expletive deleted) at all,'' the pilot
said.
   ``We're out of control,'' the co-pilot notified the tower.
   ``Okay, hang on,'' the pilot said as the plane careened down the
runway narrowly missing the control tower.
   The plane crashed through baggage carts as it headed for the
terminal.
   ``Okay hit the brakes we're gunna' hit this (expletive deleted)
here,'' the pilot said. ``We're gonna do okay here hang on.''
   The next sound on the tape was of the impact as the plane
slammed into a boarding ramp where only 10 minutes earlier another
flight had departed.
   Within 15 seconds, the fire was extinguished by waiting
emergency crews.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating
the accident, released the transcript of exchanges between the crew
and with the control tower.
   Release of the actual tape from the cockpit voice recorder, one
of two so-called black boxes planes carry, is prohibited under
federal law, said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a NTSB spokesman.
   Lopatkiewicz said the transcript was a ``factual report released
without comment. We are not analyzing anything yet.''
   The NTSB will probably finish its report early next year, he
said.
   Information from the other black box on board the Horizon plane,
the flight data recorder which monitors such things as airspeed and
compass heading, is also being reviewed, Lopatkiewicz said.

   An advocate for Puerto Rican independence
surrendered Wednesday to serve a jail term for refusing to appear
before a federal grand jury investigating the Puerto Rican
separatist group FALN.
   Nelson Ramirez, 28, a technician with the Emergency Medical
Service, reported to the U.S. marshal's office in Brooklyn as
ordered by a judge last week.
   About 30 protesters, many waving Puerto Rican flags, gathered
outside the courthouse and followed him in chanting, ``Free Puerto
Rico Now,'' and other slogans.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Platt found Ramirez in civil contempt
for refusing to answer a subpoena that would compel him to appear
before the grand jury and to give hand and voice prints.
   Platt ordered that Ramirez be jailed for the life of the grand
jury, which could be 15 months. The judge allowed him a week to
make arrangements for his pregnant wife.
   ``Today I'm stronger than I was last week and I expect to be
stronger when I get out,'' Ramirez said before his surrender.
   His attorney, Colleen McGuire, has said she was told by federal
officials that the grand jury was investigating a series of
terrorist bombings in New York City on New Year's Eve 1982 that
were blamed on FALN.
   FALN, whose full name is Spanish for Armed Forces of National
Liberation, advocates independence for the U.S. commonwealth of
Puerto Rico. The group has taken responsibility for more than 150
bombings in American cities from 1975 to 1984.
   Ramirez, of Manhattan, said he has not been politically active
for at least four years, but had previously been president of a
Puerto Rican student association at Hunter College and a member in
nationalist movement groups.

   Hundreds of radical students shouting
``Boycott military training!'' hurled rocks and firebombs Wednesday
at riot police who moved in to break up the protest. No serious
injuries were reported.
   The protest at Chungang University in Seoul turned violent when
hundreds of riot police marched on campus and fired tear gas to
disperse about 1,000 students from five Seoul colleges.
   Waves of masked students immediately dashed out and pelted
troopers with rocks and scores of flaming gasoline bombs. Female
students beat drums and carried rocks to encourage the protesters.
   A number of students and policemen were hit by rocks and other
objects, but no serious injuries were reported.
   Fighting started when students were preparing to march into the
street and continued for several hours, as students shouted ``Drive
out Yankees who hinder unification!''
   The students demanded an end to compulsory military training for
college students, denouncing the government of President Roh
Tae-woo and the United States. They contend military training for
students was ``preparation of machinery for the Yankees.''
   All male college students in South Korea are required to undergo
weekly military training on campus, along with an weeklong training
session at military barracks.
   Student speakers at a rally before the clash also demanded the
expulsion of the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under
a mutual defense pact, accusing the United States of hindering
unification of the Korean peninsula.
   Radical students want immediate reunification of the two Koreas,
divided since the end of World War II. They contend the United
States enforces partition of the peninsula to rule the South as a
colony.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on college campuses,
have failed to attract public support.
   Major street clashes occurred in Seoul on Friday when riot
police blocked thousands of radical students trying to march to the
border for talks with North Kroean students. The two Koreas remain
bitter enemies since the Communist North invaded the South in 1950
and started the three-year Korean War.
   On Wednesday, minor clashes were reported from the central city
of Taejon, when students demonstrated off campus to protest a
government ban on last week's march to the North Korean border.
   About 10 radical students staged a dawn attack with firebombs
Wednesday on an office of the government party in Seoul, police
said. The firebombs missed and caused no damage.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government
and anti-U.S. protests in the past months. Police said Wednesday
that so far this year, they fired more than 270,000 rounds of tear
gas to block demonstrations.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
registering concern about terrorism at the Olympics, said today
that North Korea has placed Soviet surface-to-air missiles within
range of Seoul where the Summer Games will be held.
   Shultz said he had received assurances from Soviet leaders that
``they feel certain there won't be any terrorist acts'' by their
North Korean allies.
   ``I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of that statement,''
Shultz said.
   But he said North Koreans ``are people you have to keep your eye
on, and we will do so.''
   Shultz made the remarks on the U.S. Information Agency
television program ``Worldnet.''
   He said the missiles had been installed near the demilitarized
zone and ``have a range that can go over the Seoul area.''
   Shultz said North Korean terrorists arranged the murder of half
of South Korea's cabinet ministers on a visit to Rangoon, Burma,
several years ago and also placed a bomb aboard a South Korean
airliner.
   ``Certain facts are disturbing,'' he said.
   Shultz said he expected the leaders of the seven Western
countries to discuss joint measures to combat terrorism at their
meeting next week in Toronto.
   As a result of a united stand, Shultz said, terrorism in Western
Europe is declining.
   He said the seven leaders may agree on a proposal that all
governments refuse to refuel hijacked planes that have landed on
their territory with hostages aboard.
   ``It's a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be
helpful,'' Shultz said.
   On another subject, the secretary dismissed the idea of a
Marshall plan to provide economic assistance to eastern Europe.
``The countries are very different from each other, and they have
to be thought of country by country.''
   He said the eastern Europeans should be approached
``one-by-one'' to develop trade and other ties with the West ``as
they seek to open themselves up.''
   Shultz described President Reagan's participation in the Toronto
summit meeting as ``a kind of valedictory'' since it will be his
last meeting with the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Italy,
West Germany and Japan before leaving office in January.
   Shultz said the economic picture had brightened considerably
since the last summit in Canada in 1981, with inflation way down,
taxes reduced and growth and incentives increased.
   Free enterprise is ``catching on'' and ``we're going to wind up
better off,'' Shultz said.

   South Korea will be able to ensure its
own defense and overcome the military superiority of communist
North Korea by the turn of the century, officials said Wednesday.
   Opposition leaders received the assessment in a briefing at the
Defense Ministry on the nation's armed forces and the threat from
the communist north.
   In a related development, North Korea on Wednesday denied South
Korean and U.S. allegations that it has deployed Soviet-made SA-5
missiles along the Korean demilitarized zone. The North Korean
armed forces, in a statement broadcast by the official Radio
Pyongyang and monitored in Tokyo, termed the allegations
``unfounded, fabricated slander.''
   The 1988 Summer Olympic Games will be held in Seoul Sept.
17-Oct. 2. South Korean and U.S. officials fear that North Korea,
which has unsuccessfully demanded to co-host the Games, may
sabotage events.
   Defense officials in Seoul said on Wednesday that South Korea's
armed forces were making substantial progress.
   ``We would complete preparations for a fully independent defense
around 2000 if the current military buildup continued,'' an
official told Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and 60 other opposition
leaders.
   Ministry officials urged the opposition leaders to help ensure
the nation's independent defense posture. They said South Korea has
greatly expanded its forces through mass domestic production of
tanks and fighters.
   South Korea is strengthening early warning systems and war
preparedness with superior naval and air strategies to counter
possible threats from the North, officials said.
   The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter opponents. The
North invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War and the two
nations maintain huge military forces in a state of frequent
tension along the border.
   Ministry officials said Wednesday that North Korea continued to
build up its armed forces, including a 96,000 member special attack
force.
   The ministry charged that the North had completed deployment of
most of its combat forces close to the border in combat positions.
They said 65 percent of the North's ground forces, 41 percent of
its fighters and 57 percent of its naval craft were deployed in
forward positions.
   The United States has 42,000 troops based in the South under a
mutual defense pact to help defend against possible threats from
the North.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and his South Korean
counterpart Oh Ja-bok closed the U.S.-South Korea Security
Consultative Meeting in Seoul on June 9 with a joint statement
saying North Korea's offensive-oriented military developments and
its strengthened surprise attack capability pose a serious threat
to South Korea.
   Carlucci and Oh also said they discussed North Korea's enhanced
offensive posture, including its recent deployment of advanced SA-5
missiles capable of striking the South Korean capital of Seoul.
   The North Korean statement Wednesday said: ``In building up arms
and increasing tensions, while slandering us under the pretext of
the Olympic Games, the U.S. imperialists ... seek to light the fuse
of a war of aggression against us.''

<HEAD>House Demos Plan Trade Bill Minus Plant-Closings Provision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats moved to breathe new life into their
vetoed trade bill Wednesday by splitting off a provision that would
require large companies to notify employees of plant closings and
major layoffs.
   ``The bottom line is that we're now going to have a trade bill
without a plant-closings provision,'' House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, told reporters.
   He said the House would repackage the plant-closings plan as
separate legislation and act on it before taking up the newly
refurbished version of its 1,000-page trade bill.
   He also said the plan envisions dropping Alaskan oil provisions
that would have capped exports from the state's new refineries at
70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of output while requiring
Canadian-bound crude shipments to detour first to ports in the
lower 48 states.
   President Reagan was critical of both the plant-closings and the
oil provisions in his May 24 veto of the trade bill. The House
subsequently voted to pass the measure notwithstanding his
objections but the Senate on June 8 fell short of the two-thirds
needed for a presidential veto override.
   At the core of the bill are provisions to overhaul the system
under which the United States imposes import curbs to protect U.S.
industries and retaliate against international trade violations. It
also would grant the administration authority to make deals in
current global trade talks.
   The bill required companies with 100 or more employees to give
60 days notice of plant closings or large-scale layoffs.
   Other provisions range from substantial agricultural subsidies
to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies.
   Senate Democrats have been saying they would seek to attach the
plant-closings provision to any refurbished trade bill sent from
the House.
   There was no immediate word on whether they would go foward with
that plan or instead redirect their efforts into the separate
plant-closings bill.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has been warning
that any new legislation was likely to become badly bogged down.
   Some of the administration's supporters in the Senate, however,
have been eager for another crack at the trade issue before
lawmakers adjourn to hit the campaign trail.
   Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter earlier called for swift
congressional action on a more moderate version of trade
legislation. And Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., has been
suggesting that he might sponsor trade legislation of his own.
   ``We're working on it,'' Dole said Wednesday. He said it was
necessary to ``get the ethanol provision out of it, otherwise
there's not going to be a trade bill.''
   One provision criticized by Reagan would permit duty-free
imports of ethanol from the Caribbean, a measure hotly opposed by
Midwest corn growers.
   AFL-CIO and other labor representatives who have been
campaigning for the plant-closings provision for 15 years
buttonholed Democratic leaders in a hallway adjacent to the House
chamber Wednesday morning.
   At one point, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., emerged from the
House chamber, where the Democratic Caucus was meeting, in an
apparent effort to smooth any ruffled feathers. They later were
ushered into Wright's office.
   Wright told reporters he would bring the new, free-standing
version of the plant-closings legislation to the House floor prior
to action on the refurbished trade bill. He said there was a good
chance a veto of the plant-closings plan could be overridden.

   As George Bush seeks to overcome his negative
ratings in presidential campaign polls, he might draw hope from
recent history: Ronald Reagan suffered equally low ratings in his
races and overcame them to win.
   But this year there is an important difference, poll analysts
say. While Reagan won by beating opponents who were viewed even
less favorably than he was, Bush faces a far more popular opponent
in Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Dukakis has scored high favorable ratings in polls this spring,
though not as high as Jimmy Carter at his pinnacle of popularity in
June of the 1976 election year. Bush has scored poorly, though not
nearly as poorly as Carter at his nadir in 1980.
   Such measures, taken by asking if poll respondents have a
favorable or unfavorable view of candidates, provide an important
guide to vote-getting ability. A poor score ``means that there's a
chunk of people who don't like you,'' said CBS News pollster
Kathleen A. Frankovic. ``They probably won't vote for you _ unless,
of course, they can't stand the other guy more.''
   Strategists on both sides have focused lately on favorability
ratings, with Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach contending
Bush was ``sitting on some of the highest unfavorable ratings of a
presidential candidate in recent memory.''
   Dach said Tuesday he based that claim on Gallup Poll figures,
but the Gallup Organization said its past figures are not
comparable to its current ones because it changed its questions and
procedures. In other, comparable polls, other candidates have rated
considerably worse than Bush rates now.
   Still, Bush's negative rating is high _ 33 percent favorable to
35 percent unfavorable in a CBS News-New York Times poll in May, 51
percent favorable to 35 percent unfavorable in a May ABC
News-Washington Post poll, 53-40 favorable to unfavorable in a
Gallup poll this week.
   Contrast the ratings for Dukakis: 38-14 favorable to unfavorable
in the CBS-Times poll, 64-11 in the ABC-Post's, 70-20 in Gallup's.
   The general election campaign, though, hardly has begun. ``We're
looking at where these people are starting out,'' Frankovic said.
``Michael Dukakis is starting out very nicely. George Bush is
starting out with as many people disliking him as liking him. So
he's got some work to do.''
   Bush's negatives are by no means historic. All three candidates
in the 1980 and 1984 elections _ Reagan, Carter and Walter Mondale
_ had as bad or worse favorability ratings during their campaigns.
In June 1980, Carter's CBS-Times rating was a dismal 33 favorable
to 60 unfavorable.
   Bush's 33-35 score in the CBS-Times poll was comparable to
Reagan's 38-38 favorability rating in September 1980. But Reagan
had the advantage of facing Carter, the unpopular incumbent.
   While Bush does not have an unpopular opponent, there has been
some movement in Dukakis' rating: He went from 15 percent
unfavorable in a Gallup Poll in May to 20 percent unfavorable the
new Gallup Poll.
   The key issue is not where a candidate stands when considered
alone, but where he stands in relationship to his opponent. ``In
1976 people liked both of them,'' said Frankovic. ``In 1980 they
really didn't like either of them. And in 1984 you had a popular
incumbent.''
   Even Reagan's advantage was not apparent from the start. In
January 1984, an ABC News-Washington Post poll gave Reagan a 54-38
favorable rating and Mondale a 48-30 rating. But 23 percent didn't
know about Mondale; many went against him, and he lost in a
landslide.
   As many, 25 percent, didn't know about Dukakis in the ABC-Post
poll in May, and pollsters noted that his high favorable rating
came amid positive publicity as he chalked up a string of primary
victories over Jesse Jackson.
   ``Dukakis has a quarter of the people who have to get to know
him,'' said Kelly Hanley, an ABC News poll analyst. ``Bush is going
to start talking about Dukakis' record, and we'll see how people
react to that.''
   Bush, with the Republican nomination wrapped up, was out of the
news in May. With voters not yet focused on the race, his rating
may have been more a reflection of Reagan's lagging popularity than
of his own standing.
   ``Those negatives don't represent some personal shortcoming with
George Bush as much as some dissatisfaction with the Reagan
administration,'' said Larry Hugick, of the Gallup Organization.
``I don't think people have much of a sense of Bush and Dukakis yet
to give a response to these questions.''
   The issue for the campaigns, the analysts said, is whether Bush
can establish his own, positive identity separate from Reagan, and
whether he can capitalize on the public's unfamiliarity with
Dukakis.

<TEXT>
   About 750 barges were backed up on the
Mississippi River near here today because of low water, and the
Army Corps of Engineers said twice as many could be stranded by the
weekend.
   The barges began backing up after one ran aground Monday and
others decided to wait for a dredge to arrive Thursday to deepen
the channel.
   ``They are skittish about using it because one mess-up costs
lots of dollars,'' said Michael Logue, spokesman for the corps'
Vicksburg District.
   The river is only 9 feet deep near Vaucluse Landing, Ark., about
3 miles north of the Greenville bridge.
   Logue said about 750 barges were backed up today and that the
number would probably double during the dredging, which is expected
to take a day or two.
   ``When the dredge gets in and begins working, it's likely we
will have to stop traffic off and on. This will back up normal
traffic.'' he said.
   Logue said the barges ``could be carrying anything _ just like
an interstate highway. It could be coal, grain, steel, chemicals,
petroleum products or military cargo. They do not normally carry
perishables.''
   He said Army engineers had no estimate of cargo value involved
in river shipping by the scores of barge lines that operate on the
Mississippi.
   Ron Goldman, chief of water control management for the Vicksburg
District, said the Mississippi is at its lowest point for this time
of year since records were first kept in 1872.
   He said the Vicksburg gauge read 2.5 feet on Tuesday. The lowest
level on record is minus 7 feet in February 1940, when much of the
upper river froze solid.
   Without significant rainfall, the river will fall below zero on
the Vicksburg gauge within two weeks, Goldman said, with zero on
the gauge representing 46.2 feet above mean sea level.
   Louis Logue, chief of river operations for the corps' Vicksburg
District and Michael Logue's brother, said dozens of other trouble
spots could develop if the river falls as expected.
   ``I'm talking seriously with the Lord about this now,'' he said.
``Up until now I've just been talking regularly.''

   Traditionalist Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre heralded the first split in the Roman Catholic Church in
more than a century with an announcement today that he will
consecrate four bishops June 30.
   The consecration, without papal authority, seems certain to lead
to the excommunication of Lefebvre and the first schism since the
Old Catholics broke from Rome in 1870 because they refused to
accept the dogma of papal infallibity.
   In the Vatican, church spokesman Dr. Joaquin Navarro said the
announcement ``has serious canonical consequences and make
inevitable procedures for warning those involved.''
   ``The Holy See is also following with particular concern the
faithful who have chosen this option, which puts them outside the
ecclesiastical communion,'' Navarro said in the statement.
   Navarro's office said he was unavailable for further comment.
   Speaking at a news conference, Lefebvre, the 82-year-old founder
of the traditionalist St. Pius X Fraternity, announced that these
four traditionalist priests will be consecrated June 30:
   _The Rev. Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, secretary general of
Lefebvre's fraternity.
   _The Rev. Richard Williamson. head of the Traditionalist Center
in Ridgefield, Conn.
   _The Rev. Alfonse de Gallereta, head of the Traditionalist
Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
   _The Rev. Bernard Felley, chief administrator of the fraternity,
a Swiss national.
   The rupture followed months of efforts pushed by Pope John Paul
II to work out a reconciliation with Lefebvre, suspended since 1976
from his priestly functions for revolting against the church
reforms.
   Lefebvre holds that modernistic trends, condemned by the patron
saint of his society, assumed ``self-destructive'' proportions in
the reforms instituted by the Second Vatican Council 1963-65.
   He is the only archbishop in the traditionalist movement but
claims several other bishops share his traditional views.
   In defiance of the 1976 order by Pope Paul VI, barring him from
saying Mass and giving the sacraments, he has ordained more than
200 priests. They continue to use a 16th century Latin rite, the
forbidden Tridentine Mass.
   His movement claims millions of followers throughout the world.
   Lefebvre has said he would ignore an act of excommunication.
Ejection from the church is the Vatican's most drastic sanction.
   In a 1976 interview with The Associated Press, he said: ``It is
not we who have entered into schism. It is the pope who causes
schism to the extent to which he breaks with the church
traditions.''
   Anti-Vatican rhetoric has been less sharp since John Paul II
became pope. But Lefebvre's announcement last year that he is
considering the consecration of bishops brought new tension.
   He spoke of new evidence that the Vatican was plunging into the
``darkness of errors.'' He cited a 1986 meeting Pope John Paul
organized with the leaders of many world religions and a
``disappointing'' response he received from the Vatican to
questions concerning religious freedom.
   Lefebvre opposes the strengthening of contacts with Protestants
and other Christian religions.
   ``True ecumenism consists of trying to bring home the lost
sheep,'' said the Rev. Franz Schmidberger, who succeeded Lefebvre
as superior general of the Fraternity.
   The Vatican has made a series of conciliatory gestures,
culminating May 5 with the signing of a protocol that seemed to be
the basis of an accord. It reportedly provided for the recognition
of Lefebvre's Fraternity and the ordinations in return for a formal
acceptance of church reforms.
   However, Lefebvre reportedly felt that some points were too
restrictive. Proposals for new negotiations were left unanswered by
the Vatican, a source in the traditionalist movement said.
   Lefebvre then told the pope in a letter that he would proceed
with the consecrations, said the source, who insisted on anonymity.

<HEAD>Super Collider Go-Ahead Should Be Left Up to Next President,
Senate Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

   The Senate on Wednesday joined the House in
decreeing that the decision on whether to build the superconducting
super collider should be made by the next president.
   The Senate took the position as it voted 92-5 for its first
major fiscal 1989 appropriations bill, a $18.05 billion package to
finance energy and water development programs in the year beginning
next Oct. 1.
   The bill totals nearly $300 million more than what the House has
approved for the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation
and research activities by the Energy Department.
   Negotiators from both chambers will have to work out differences
in the two bills, which failed to grant an administration request
for more than $350 million to begin construction of the
superconducting super collider, envisioned as the world's most
powerful atom smasher.
   Backers of the proposed multibillion-dollar high-energy physics
project say it could carry the nation to new scientific frontiers.
   Both bills provide $100 million to continue early research on
the super collider, but both specifically forbid any spending to
start building the facility, which could cost $5.4 billion or more.
   Appropriations committee leaders on both sides of the Capitol
have said they want the next president to review the project and
decide whether to seek congressional approval to build it at a
yet-unspecified site.
   Supporters of the super collider say it is vital if this country
is to be competitive with other nations in the area of basic
science and technology. Opponents argue that the facility could eat
up money needed by other areas of science.
   Managers of the bills have agreed that in a time of tight money
and huge budget deficits, there is no money next year for the corps
and the bureau to start construction of new water projects.
   Both bills do contain funds to continue construction work on
dozens of dams, harbors and irrigation systems and to operate and
maintain hundreds of completed water projects.
   Nearly half the money in both bills, or $8 billion, is earmarked
for the Energy Department for defense-related nuclear activities.
   On Tuesday, the Senate approved its first fiscal 1989 spending
bill, a $1.7 million package to finance Congress next year.

   Members of a truck convoy carrying aid to
Nicaragua were turned away at the Mexican border today by U.S.
Customs officials and then formed a human chain to block traffic on
the principal bridge over the Rio Grande.
   A Mexican federal officical broke up the bridge blockade about
12:15 p.m.
   The blockade began when Customs officials detained a convoy
truck and its driver as he attempted to cross the bridge in
defiance of federal authorities.
   Earlier Wednesday, Customs agents stopped the Veterans' Peace
Convoy to Nicaragua a block from Bridge No. 1 and attempted to
route it to an inspection area other than the one at the bridge,
but the group refused to budge.
   ``We're insisting that we be allowed to proceed right up to this
inspection area, as previously agreed upon,'' said Gerry Condon, a
convoy organizer.
   ``The difference is we know this inspection area; that's where
the media is, that's where our supporters are, that's the agreement
we had with them. We're not going to let them lead us by the nose
and take us out of sight of people.''
   One convoy vehicle, driven by Bob Livesey of Dorchester, Mass.,
later drove up to the bridge, where Customs officials refused to
allow it to turn south toward Mexico.
   Another vehicle, driven by Hal Muskat of San Francisco, was
detained about noon.
   ``My instructions are that I am not to allow you to leave,''
said James Purser, chief Customs inspector in Laredo.
   ``We're going to keep on trying to get our vehicles down here to
the border one at a time,'' Condon said.
   As police and Customs officials stood by the roadblock, convoy
members and supporters sang the song, ``Give Peace a Chance,'' and
chanted ``Let the Convoy Pass.''
   Witnesses said a small caravan left the convoy campsite for the
bridge five miles away shortly before 9 a.m. About 20 supporters of
the group held signs that said, ``Embargo South Africa, Not
Nicaragua'' and ``Let The Convoy Pass.''
   The group must submit to a Customs inspection to enter Mexico.
Customs officials said that the group is being asked to comply with
normal export procedures and that it has played up the issue to
attract media attention.
   About 200 convoy members and supporters held a rally Tuesday
night at its camp. Many shouted, ``Viva Nicaragua libre!'' (``Long
live free Nicaragua!'') when candles were lit during the rally,
which featured leftist folk songs and an appearance by Rep. Mickey
Leland, D-Texas.
   ``I'm here to do what I can to see to it that the convoy gets
across the border and to Nicaragua to deliver the humanitarian aid
that they have,'' Leland said.
   Notables including Jesse Jackson and actor Ed Asner also have
urged the U.S. government to allow it to pass.
   Leland met earlier Tuesday with U.S. Customs officials in Laredo
and spoke by phone with Treasury Secretary James Baker trying to
persuade him to ease the ban on donating vehicles to Nicaragua,
said convoy member Tom Hansen.
   About 30 tons of food, medicine and clothing are loaded on 38
vehicles. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets
Control has told the convoy the cargo may be taken to Nicaragua,
but that leaving the vehicles there would violate a trade embargo
in effect with that leftist-ruled country for three years.
   Violating the embargo could result in fines of up to $50,000 and
up to 10 years in prison.
   In addition, Condon said, Customs officials have told the convoy
members that if they plan to go to Nicaragua without intending to
return the vehicles within 30 days, the vehicles would be seized
and the drivers subject to arrest.
   Condon said Tuesday the convoy did not intend to violate any
laws, but added that the group was prepared to face a seizure when
it reached Customs at Laredo's Bridge No. 1 today.
   Convoy members contend that the vehicles, mostly pickup trucks,
are a form of humanitarian aid exempted from the Nicaraguan Trade
Control Regulations.
   Asner spoke on the phone to convoy participants Tuesday. The
nighttime rally also included the reading of a message Jackson sent
to Baker, urging him to allow the convoy to pass.
   ``I hope that you will be guided by their example, expressed in
their words, `Feed the children, not the war,''' the Mailgram from
Jackson said.
   The convoy left from four different regions of the United States
on May 21 and has been camped in Laredo since June 7.
   The U.S. government, which supports the Nicaraguan Contras
fighting the leftist Sandinista government, imposed the trade
control regulata in May 1985.

   Maoist rebels shot and killed an American
agronomist and a Peruvian colleague after dragging them from their
pickup truck on an isolated road, government officials said today.
   The attack Monday night was the second killing of an American in
the 8-year-old Shining Path guerrilla insurgency. Last week,
pro-Cuba guerrillas in Lima lobbed three mortar rounds at the
residence of the U.S. ambassador, causing minor damage but no
injuries.
   The U.S. Embassy said two agronomists working for a U.S.-funded
agricultural development project were reported ambushed and killed
near Huancayo, a city 125 miles east of Lima. The embassy declined
to confirm their identities or nationalities.
   The National Agrarian Research Institute said the victims were
Constantin Gregori of the United States and Gustavo Rojas, a
Peruvian.
   Institute spokesman Javier Recuenco said the men were en route
from Aramachay, 15 miles north of Huancayo, to buy supplies in the
town of Sincos when the attack occurred.
   Huancayo police said Gregori, 38, and Rojas, 35, were pulled
from their vehicle and killed with two gunshots to the head after
their identification papers were checked.
   The U.S. Embassy said the victims worked with the institute in a
program funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. A
spokesman said they taught peasant farmers how to improve
production of sheep and small farm animals.
   The two men lived in Aramachay, Recuenco said.
   The Shining Path previously has assassinated development workers
in Peru's impoverished highlands in an effort to create economic
chaos.
   The Shining Path insurgency has claimed 10,000 lives. The other
American to die in the guerrilla war was a Texas woman who was
among seven passengers killed when rebels bombed a train heading
for the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Bus drivers in a northeastern Polish city
staged a wage strike Wednesday, the government said. It was the
first confirmed work stoppage in Poland since a wave of labor
unrest in May.
   A government spokesman, Ryszard Strauss, said the strike idled
part of the Lomza's transit system. But the strike was settled by
the end of the day, a man answering the phone at the transit
offices said.
   News of the settlement was not immediately confirmed by the
government.
   The city is 90 miles northeast of Warsaw and has 51,000
residents.
   ``The matter has been settled and there is nothing going on,''
said the man at the transit offices, who would not give his name.
``We achieved an agreement satisfying both sides.'' He gave no
further details.
   Strauss said the demands involved basic pay and overtime and
some ``social privileges'' such as lowering of retirement age.
   He said he did not know how many strikers there were, or detail
how much the strikers made or how much more they were demanding.
   Five strikes involving thousands of workers took place in Poland
between April 25 and May 10 in the worst outbreak of labor unrest
since the 1981 imposition of martial law and suppression of the
Solidarity trade union.

   Richard W. Murphy, the State Department's top
Middle East policymaker, will begin a trip to Iraq and other
Persian Gulf nations this week to discuss regional peace efforts,
the department announced Wednesday.
   Besides Iraq, which has been fighting a war with Iran since
1981, Murphy will visit Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain,
the United Arab Emirates and North Yemen, department spokesman
Charles E. Redman said.
   Murphy is assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs.
   ``His visit to these states is part of the close consultative
process we have with them,'' Redman said. ``He'll be exchanging
views on a number of bilateral and regional issues. Obviously,
among others, this would include subjects like our continuing
efforts to launch a Mideast peace process and the Iran-Iraq war.''
   Redman said the trip would begin this week, but he gave no
dates, in keeping with a longstanding policy of limiting
information about official travel to the volatile Middle East.
   The United States has been seeking an end to the 7-year-old
Iran-Iraq war through diplomacy, notably an effort to get the
United Nations to impose an arms embargo against Iran. The Soviet
Union and China have blocked implemenation of the weapons ban.
   The United States is also using its naval forces to protect
shipping in the Persian Gulf and has proposed the sale of arms to
Kuwait and other oil-rich countries seeking sophisticated weapons
for defense against spillover attacks.

<HEAD>Idaho High Court Voids Drunken Driving Roadblocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Idaho's Supreme Court today struck down as
unconstitutional the use of police roadblocks to catch drunken
drivers.
   The 3-2 decision, written by Justice Robert Huntley, found the
roadblocks violated the state constitution's ban on unreasonable
search and seizure.
   ``In light of the individual's right of freedom from arbitrary
governmental intrusion and the questionable efficacy of roadblocks,
we conclude that such roadblocks cannot withstand constitutional
scrutiny,'' Huntley wrote.
   The decision came on an appeal by David Henderson, one of 11
motorists picked up for drunken driving during a two-hour roadblock
operated by Boise police on Memorial Day weekend in 1985.
   All motorists approaching the roadblock were briefly stopped for
evidence of intoxication.
   Huntley also said there was no authority for stopping motorists
without evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
   ``A citizen is free to stroll the streets, hike the mountains
and float the rivers of this state without interference from the
government,'' Huntley wrote. ``That is, police treat you as a
criminal only if your actions correspond.''
   Acting Justice Jesse Walters dissented, supported by Justice
Robert Bakes.
   He said the need to prevent alcohol-related accidents by
deterring drunken driving ``outweighs the minimal intrusion''
imposed on motorists.
   ``The scales tip in favor of the public welfare,'' he wrote,
``and hence justify the systematic, nondiscretionary and brief stop
to check the sobriety of the driver.''

   ``I do not expect that, I do not want that,
and I have signaled ... that I do not want that to happen,'' said
Howard H. Baker Jr.
   Baker was talking about the possibility of his being offered the
Republican vice presidential nomination.
   He was talking about it in 1980.
   Cut to 1988. Baker, the outgoing White House chief of staff, is
asked the same question.
   ``It's really something that is presumptuous in the extreme to
say, `No, I would not do that,''' Baker said Tuesday. ``But I do
not want to do that, I do not expect to do that, and I think it's
extremely unlikely I would be asked to do that.''
   For 20 years, the name of the former GOP Senate leader from
Tennessee has cropped up as a contender for the paty's national
ticket.
   ``The poor guy's been dragged through this more than any human
should take, but maybe the eighth time's a charm, or however many
it's been,'' says former White House political director Mitchell
Daniels Jr., a long-time Baker fan.
   Others say Baker does not appear to be a leading contender to be
Vice President George Bush's running mate.
   ``I think they could do a whole lot worse than Howard Baker, but
I have not heard a lot of speculation about it, and I don't see his
name often mentioned,'' said Howard Liebengood, a key Senate staff
member when Baker was majority leader.
   Baker, 62, recalled recently that the first time he was
mentioned as a possible running mate was in 1968, the year Richard
Nixon chose Spiro Agnew. That was just two years after Baker's
election to the Senate.
   The Tennessee senator moved into the national spotlight during
the Senate Watergate hearings, asking over and over, ``What did the
president know and when did he know it?''
   In 1976, he was on then President Gerald R. Ford's list of
potential running mates, but was passed over in favor of Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole. Baker supporters blamed his loss on publicity
following disclosure that Baker's wife, Joy, had been hospitalized
for a drinking problem five years earlier.
   Baker became Senate minority leader in 1977 and ran for the GOP
presidential nomination from that post in 1980, bowing out after
faring poorly in early primaries. That year's Republican landslide
made him majority leader, but he retired from the Senate in 1984
and set his sights on a bid for the presidency this year. He put
that aside when President Reagan asked him to replace Donald T.
Regan as chief of staff at the height of the Iran-Contra crisis in
February 1987.
   Baker's supporters say his assets as a running mate include his
national stature, his Southern political base and his appeal to
independent voters.
   ``He has always been an attractive figure among Democrats and
independents, where the vice president needs to make real gains,''
said Daniels.
   Possible liabilities include conservative resentment over his
moderate record in the Senate, especially his support of the Panama
Canal treaties.
   ``He has always been sort of the poster child villain of the
Panama Canal treaty debate with certain elements on the right,''
said Liebengood. ``I would hope he has lived some of that down in
their eyes, but you never know.''
   Baker's tenure as White House chief of staff could bolster his
credentials with conservatives but hurt his chances among those who
argue Bush should assert his independence from the Reagan
administration.
   ``It cuts both ways,'' said Tom Korologos, a former White House
aide with strong Republican ties. ``It's more of a plus, except
there will be the naysayers who say, `You're not independent
enough.'''
   Baker has stopped short of saying he would not take the
nomination if offered. ``You don't turn down requests of that sort
if they are made,'' Baker said Tuesday.
   Said Daniels: ``As the race continues to come more and more into
focus, some very worthy candidates make less sense and some make
more, and he is one that I think makes very good sense.''

   Backers of a North Dakota lottery said
Wednesday the issue will probably be put to voters again in
November, despite its second rejection at the polls in 18 months.
   ``There's a very good chance we'll do it again,'' retired
businessman Gorman King Sr. said after voters turned thumbs down
Tuesday on a proposed amendment to the state constitution.
   Final unofficial totals showed the lottery measure had failed
61,082 votes, or 58 percent, to 44,043 votes, or 42 percent.
   King also was the driving force behind a November 1986 lottery
initiative, which failed 55 percent to 45 percent.
   North Dakota already had the distinction of being the only state
to reject a state-run lottery at the polls, according to the
National Conference of State Legislatures.
   Former Gov. Arthur Link, an outspoken foe of all forms of
gaming, said he hoped King would abide by the voters' judgment and
drop his crusade.
   ``It would seem to me a decisive expression of the will of the
people, and I would hope that the proponents would accept the
decision of the voters of North Dakota,'' Link said.
   Link was joined by religious groups and North Dakota charitable
gaming organizations, which feared a lottery would cut into their
gambling take.
   King's most recent lottery initiative called for channeling
lottery profits into the state general fund. He expected the North
Dakota game to gross $20 million in its first year, with $7 million
going to the state.
   Twenty-six states _ including neighboring South Dakota and
Montana _ operate lotteries, as does the District of Columbia.

<TEXT>
   An increasing number of insurance companies
are offering substantial premium discounts to the owners of cars
equipped with air bags, the Transportation Department said
Wednesday.
   Discounts for personal injury or medical premiums at 12 auto
insurance companies range from 15 percent to 60 percent on cars in
which air bags protect the driver in a collision, the department
said.
   It cautioned, however, that the discounts are not available in
all states. They are not permitted in Hawaii, Massachusetts, North
Carolina, Texas, Illinois and Kentucky, it said.
   The bags are becoming available on an increasing number of cars.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that
by 1990 more than 2 million new cars will have the devices, which
inflate in a split second to protect a driver in a collision.
   ``Air bags alone can reduce the chance of fatality in crashes by
20 to 40 percent and, combined with a (safety) belt, can reduce the
risk by 50 to 55 percent,'' said Diane Steed, head of the highway
safety agency.
   The United States Automobile Association, or USAA, offers the
biggest discount. It recently announced a 60 percent reduction in
personal injury and medical payments and a $300 direct payment for
the purchase of an air bag.
   The air bags have cost up to $800 as an option on some Ford
Motor Co. cars, but the prices are expected to go down as a larger
number of bags are made available.
   Chrysler Corp. announced recently that it is installing air bags
as standard equipment on six 1988 model cars. Other cars that have
them as standard equipment are the Acura, BMW, Mercedes Benz,
Porsche and Volvo, according to the safety agency.
   Ford has offered the air bag as optional equipment on its Ford
Tempo and Mercury Topaz and may provide them as standard equipment
on some 1989 model cars. General Motors Corp., offers the bags as
an option on the 1988 Oldsmobile Delta 88 and plans to offer them
on additional car lines in 1989.
   By 1990, more than 2 million new cars are expected to come off
the assembly lines equipped with driver-side air bags, Ms. Steed
said.
   Auto safety advocates long have urged the insurance industry to
offer premium discounts for air bags to help persuade car buyers to
ask for the devices.
   According to the safety agency, the following discounts are
being offered for driver-side air bag equipped cars: USAA, 60
percent; Aetna Casualty, Geico, Continental Casualty, Prudential,
AMICA, all 30 percent; Nationwide, 25 percent; Allstate, State
Farm, Liberty Mutual, Hartford, all 20 percent; and Travelers, 15
percent.
   The air bag, which is stored in the steering wheel, inflates
within 1-20th of a second after electronic sensors detect the
beginning of impact in a crash. It then immediately deflates after
protecting the driver's head and upper torso.

   James C. Miller II, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, said Wednesday that responsible employees
are threatened by having to work with and depend upon co-workers
who may be impaired by use of illegal drugs.
   Miller also told a House subcommittee that customers, including
the federal government, ``should not have to wonder whether the
products they purchase will fail because the workers putting them
together were high on drugs.''
   Testifying before the House Government Operations legislation
and national security subcommittee, Miller said the Reagan
administration supports efforts to create a drug-free workplace but
has reservations about legislation before Congress, including a
bill by the panel's chairman, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas.
   The Brooks bill would require federal contractors and grantees
to establish a drug-free workplace policy, require employees to
observe that policy and would provide sanctions when that policy
fails and drug abuse in the workplace occurs. The sanctions, which
would be applied under due process requirements, include future
disbarment of contractors who are frequent violators.
   Miller said he particularly opposed parts of the Brooks bill
which calls for employers and employees to certify that they are
complying with the law, an action he said would require ``extensive
new paperwork burdens.''
   A measure by Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., would require
debarment if one employee is convicted of using illegal drugs. Dale
E. Kildee, D-Mich., would deprive a grantee or contractor of
federal contracts and grants if the company fails to make a
good-faith effort to keep a drug-free workplace.
   Miller said he would like to see one measure emerge from the
several before Congress but that the program ``be flexible enough
to permit departments and agencies to address the problems they
face in the most effective way.''
   He suggested that, instead of being specific, Congress should
take a broader approach in enacting the law. OMB could issue
guidelines for each of the departments and agencies to use in
promulgating regulations.

<HEAD>Salk Presents Encouraging Results On AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pioneer of the polio vaccine
presented encouraging but preliminary test results Wednesday of a
new vaccine intended to keep people infected with the AIDS virus
from getting the disease.
   Dr. Jonas Salk described the experimental use of his vaccine on
nine men who had ARC, or AIDS-related complex, a disease that often
precedes full-blown AIDS.
   Although Salk made no strong claims about the initial results,
he said they convinced him to begin giving the vaccine to 54 people
who have been infected with the AIDS virus but who have not yet
become ill with ARC or AIDS.
   ``We believe we might possibly get a positive answer,'' he said
in an interview in Stockholm at the Fourth International Conference
on AIDS. ``That's why we set out. When nature gives me the answer,
I will tell you.''
   Researchers do not know how many people who are infected with
the virus will go on to develop AIDS. The most current studies show
that 48 percent of people will develop AIDS about 10 years after
infection, and that number may get higher as more time passes.
   Salk, founding director of the Salk Institute in San Diego,
tested the new vaccine with Dr. Alexandra Levine and other doctors
at the University of Southern California.
   Unlike most other vaccines, this one is intended to stimulate
the body to fight off a virus that has already become established
rather than keep one from getting in.
   It involves giving people AIDS virus that has been killed,
exposed to radiation and stripped of its outer envelope of protein.
This theoretically exposes the immune system to parts of the virus
that it would not ordinarily see.
   If the approach works as planned, the body will produce
antibodies to the virus's inner machinery and kill it.
   ``Perhaps we can boost immunity and prevent clinical illness,''
said Levine. ``We are not talking about curing AIDS.''
   The initial study was intended largely to test the vaccine's
safety. One of the nine men developed AIDS a few weeks after the
innoculation. However, the other eight are reasonably well and
working.
   Levine said most of them are producing and perhaps increasing
numbers of T cells, the blood cells that are attacked and killed by
the AIDS virus, HIV. In the man with the strongest apparent
reaction, the doctors have not been able to detect any sign of the
AIDS virus.
   ``They are very encouraging results. The virus has disappeared''
in one patient, said Dr. Marc Girard of the Pasteur Institute in
Paris.
   Dr. Leigh Ann Sawyer of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
cautioned, ``We are very interested in their results, but it's
really too early to tell.''
   Most other AIDS vaccine tests have involved giving people just
the outer envelope of the virus.
   ``The envelope doesn't seem to be doing anything,'' Salk said.
``Why not use the whole virus? That's what I used before'' in the
polio vaccine. ``I thought I would try it the old-fashioned way.''
   Dr. Daniel Zagury of the University of Paris administered the
first experimental AIDS vaccine intended to prevent infection in
1986.
   He gave it to himself and reported evidence Wednesday that
booster shots, made from infected and killed blood cells taken from
his own body, can enhance the body's production of antibodies
against the virus.
   He said his own body has produced high levels of AIDS
antibodies, some of which are capable of neutralizing the AIDS
virus.
   ``What he has done so far is not applicable to large numbers of
people,'' said Dr. Dani Bolognesi of Duke University.
   Zagury said he hopes to find a way to produce a vaccine that
will not require booster shots made from the recipients' own blood
cells.
   He said he also plans to produce large quantities of AIDS
antibodies his body produces. He hopes to give these to babies born
to mothers who are infected with the AIDS virus. The goal is to
kill the virus that may be lurking in their bodies before they also
become ill.
   In other research presented at the meeting:
   _Dr. George Lemp of the San Francisco Department of Public
Health said that people carry the AIDS for an average of 11 years
before getting sick. Earlier, experts had estimated the incubation
period to be eight years.
   _Dr. Scott Holmberg of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
provided more evidence that having genital herpes makes it easier
to catch the AIDS virus. He found that herpes-infected homosexual
men who had unprotected sex with AIDS carriers were two to three
times more likely to contract the AIDS virus.

   The Supreme Court, in a victory for the Reagan
administration and free-trade advocates, ruled today the government
does not have to place restrictions on imported uranium to help
protect domestic producers of the nuclear fuel.
   The unanimous ruling overturned a decision barring federal
officials from enriching foreign uranium, particularly from Canada
and Australia, for import into the United States.
   Administration officials had argued that the ban seriously
jeopardized U.S. trade, nuclear cooperation and non-proliferation
policies and could limit the supply of fuel used to run electric
utility company nuclear reactors.
   Today's decision reversed a ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals based in Denver, which said last year that the
Department of Energy must restrict enrichment of foreign uranim to
safeguard the deteriorating domestic industry.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in his opinion for the high court,
said federal law does not require the department to restrict
enrichment unless it is assured such action would maintain ``a
viable domestic uranium industry.''
   Federal officials have determined that the industry has not been
viable since 1983.
   The industry has suffered in recent years with the decline of
nuclear power due to its high cost and concern over safety
triggered by the accident at the Three Mile Island reactor in
Pennsylvania.
   The number of operating uranium mines in the United States has
dropped from 362 in 1979 to just three in 1986. The industry has
operated at a loss over the last several years and imports have
accounted for an increasing share of domestic requirements.
   Federal energy officials say the U.S. uranium industry has
collapsed and the government is not required by law to prop it up
by limiting imports.
   In 1983, federal law was amended to require the secretary of
energy to annually determine if the industry was viable. The
secretary then determined the industry was not viable and the U.S.
Trade Representative recommended no action be taken to restrict
import of uraniium.
   Uranium must be enriched to serve as nuclear fuel because in its
natural state it lacks an adequate concentration of a fissionable
material known as isotope U-235.
   The enrichment process increases uranium's U-235 content from
less than 1 percent to 3 percent.
   The government has a U.S. monopoly in providing enrichment
services.
   Federal officials said at least $300 million a year in fees for
enrichment services was at stake in today's case.
   Also, the Justice Department said restricting enriched uranium
from other countries could force up prices of electricity to
consumers here as supplies of the nuclear fuel dwindle.
   The department said also at stake were U.S. trade relations with
Canada and Australia, the major suppliers of uranium to his country.
   Finally, U.S. officials said barring uranium imports could harm
nuclear non-proliferation efforts because foreign supliers of
uranium likely would turn for enrichment services to other nations
that do not have as strict a non-proliferation polcy as the United
States.
   Underscoring today's ruling are conflicts in Congress over the
recently signed U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. The
administration recently has begun negotiating an alternative plan
in which the government would buy guaranteed amounts of domestic
uranium.
   But that plan, estimated to cost $750 million from 1989 to 1994,
also faces stiff resistance from House leaders who say it would be
too costly to the taxpayers.
   Meanwhile, the Senate passed a bill in March designed to
revitalize the domestic uranium industry by imposing a schedule of
escalating fees on nuclear utilities that load their reactors with
more than 37.5 percent of foreign uranium.
   That bill has run into stiff opposition in the House.
   In today's case, the government was opposed by three U.S.
uranium producers, Western Nuclear Inc., Energy Fuels Inc. and
Uranium Resources Inc.
   The producers were supported by officials from Wyoming, New
Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and Nevada. They said their state
economies would be hurt by the collapse of the uranium industry.
   The case is Huffman vs. Western Nuclear, 87-645.

   A security guard rescued a giant toad from
a downtown street and splinted its broken leg with a paint stirrer,
but one wildlife expert suggested the pesky four-pound amphibian
would be better dead than fed.
   Jim Bartlett, 20, found the 9-inch green-and-brown toad when he
got out of his car after seeing an animal that had evidently been
struck by a vehicle.
   ``I thought it was a dead cat or something. I wasn't prepared
for this,'' Bartlett said Wednesday, holding up the toad he named
Turbo.
   Wildlife and agriculture officials believe Turbo is a Bufo
marinus, a giant toxic toad native to coastal areas in South
America but introduced to South Florida in the 1930s to try to
control the beetle population in sugar cane fields. They grow up to
a foot long and are sometimes found around Miami.
   ``I have never heard of one that far north,'' said Henry
Mushinsky, a biologist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.
``But they are becoming more and more common here (in Florida). The
fact that we haven't had any harsh winters in the last few years
has helped them move up both coastlines.''
   Wildlife and agriculture officials fear the giant toad could
become a proliferating pest on the order of the Mediterranean fruit
fly, the Formosan termite or the South American fire ant.
   ``If he found several dozen, then we would be concerned,'' said
Lt. John Moran, a wildlife inspector at the state Game and
Freshwater Fish Commission office in Orlando.
   One agricultural specialist whom Bartlett's mother, Mary,
contacted suggested that their Turbo would be better dead than fed.
   ``I can't see killing something that hasn't done anyone any
harm,'' said Bartlett, who has tried to nurse Turbo to health.
   Bartlett said he would turn over the toad to the Central Florida
Zoo. Senior reptile keeper Carl Barden will examine it.
   Bufo marinus has glands near its eyes containing a strong poison
that can cause temporary blindness in humans if the fluid comes
into contact with the eyes. The white secretion also can kill small
animals, including cats and dogs, that eat the toad.
   Turbo is showing signs of a pet personality, the Bartletts said.
   ``He seems to like affection,'' said Mrs. Bartlett. ``When you
stroke his back, he pushes himself up and moves around like a cat.''

   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III told
Congress on Wednesday that the United States will lose its veto
over major decisions of the World Bank unless it puts up $70
million to join in increasing the bank's capital.
   ``I think it would be absolutely catastrophic if we withheld our
cooperation and lost the veto right that now exists,'' he said at a
hearing of the House Banking Committee.
   He argued that the World Bank, the largest source of aid to the
Third World, helps countries like Argentina and Mexico which are
important to U.S. national security but get no direct aid from the
United States.
   The U.S. veto right affects only major changes in the bank,
which is owned by 151 countries. The United States has the largest
voting strength, about 15 percent. This would be diluted if it
failed to take up the shares allotted to it in the current general
increase of its capital, which is already 79 percent susbcribed.
   Baker said only 11 countries have so far failed to take up their
shares, including the United States. Among them are Libya, Cambodia
and Vietnam.
   One World Bank official, spokesman Peter Riddleberger, has
suggested that Japan could became the largest single stockholder.
That would force the bank to shift its headquarters to Tokyo after
44 years in Washington.
   The U.S. veto does not apply to individual loans, which total
$17 billion a year. The increased capital will enable it to loan
well over $20 billion annually in the 1990s.
   Baker said the United States has opposed individual loans to
some members of the bank that have communist governments. In some
cases the United States was outvoted. In others, the U.S.
representative supported loans to Yugoslavia, Poland and Hungary
but not in the past three years, he added.

   Four years of providing clean syringes
and needles to drug addicts in Amsterdam has produced a significant
drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb the spread of AIDS,
researchers said Wednesday.
   Furthermore, the needle exchange program did not lead to
increased drug use, as critics of such programs had feared, said
Ernst Buning, a psychologist with the Amsterdam Municipal Health
Service in the Netherlands.
   Speaking at the Fourth International Conference on AIDS, Buning
said the program gave health workers an opportunity to tell addicts
how to lower their AIDS risk, and the counseling was a critical
component of the exchange program.
   ``Our conclusion is that the needle and syringe exchange helps
addicts to use drugs safely,'' he said.
   The first U.S. needle exchange program will begin soon in
Portland, Oregon, under the sponsorship of the American Foundation
for AIDS Research.
   The foundation announced the program last week and said it was
designed to determine if needle exchanges curb the spread of AIDS
among addicts.
   In a separate report to the conference, Don Des Jarlais of the
New York State Division of Substance Abuse Services said
drug-related AIDS cases in the United States are increasingly
linked to cocaine rather than heroin. He said the trading of sex
for drugs among crack users created the ``potential for further
catastrophe'' by spreading the epidemic.
   Drug-related AIDS is also spreading to parts of the developing
world where illicit drug shipments originate, Des Jarlais said.
   The reason for the growing link between AIDS and cocaine
injection may be partly due to the frequency with which cocaine
users must inject themselves, Des Jarlais said.
   Heroin users may inject themselves three or four times per day,
Des Jarlais said. But cocaine users may inject themselves as often
as every 15 minutes until their cocaine supply is exhausted, he
said.
   ``That can lead to almost continuous sharing of drug injection
equipment and a much greater likelihood of viral transmission,'' he
said.
   The needle exchange program in Amsterdam reaches about 5,000 of
the city's 7,000 intravenous drug abusers, Buning said. Last year,
700,000 needles and syringes were exchanged, he said.
   Interviews with 148 intravenous drug abusers showed that about
half of them were participating in the needle exchange, using clean
needles 90 percent of the time, Buning said. The other half
participated in the program rarely or not at all, he said.
   Among those participating, only 10 percent were sharing needles
and at highest risk of AIDS, Buning said.
   Among non-participants, 24 percent were sharing needles, he said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a disease in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   The disease is transmitted primarily through sexual contact and
the sharing of needles and syringes by drug abusers. Various
reports at the AIDS conference have identified drug-related AIDS as
one of the most rapidly growing components of the AIDS epidemic.
   Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted
blood or blood products and the passage of the disease from mother
to child at or before birth.
   The spread of AIDS among cocaine abusers, which Des Jarlais said
has been observed in New York City and San Francisco, is also of
concern because of the difficulty of treating cocaine addiction,
Des Jarlais said.
   As of June 6, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control had reports
of 64,506 cases of AIDS in the United States, 11,914 of which, or
18 percent, were among non-homosexual intravenous drug abusers.
   Des Jarlais noted the hopeful sign that the overall spread of
AIDS among drug abusers appears to be slowing. In San Francisco, 15
percent to 20 percent of cocaine and heroin abusers have been
infected with the virus, but that figure has not increased for
about 18 months, he said.
   In New York City, 55 percent to 60 percent of the drug abusers
are infected, and that figure has been stable for about three
years, he said.
   ``We have seen substantial behavior change in a variety of
cities,'' Des Jarlais said.

   A federal magistrate recommended jail for a former
mercenary who refused to answer questions in a $24 million lawsuit
that claims former CIA officials and Contra leaders ran a
guns-for-drugs smuggling ring.
   Sam Hall has refused to answer questions during depositions
about who trained and paid him in Nicaragua. The suit is set for
trial June 27.
   Hall, who was kicked out of Nicaragua after officials there said
he had been caught spying for the Contras, appeared Wednesday
without his attorney before U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff to
answer contempt charges.
   ``I know what's facing me,'' said Hall. ``But it has to do with
principle.''
   He said he would not answer questions that might embarrass
anti-communist crusader and former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, his
boss while he was in Nicaragua, although he said their activities
were not illegal.
   The suit was filed by journalist Tony Avirgan, who was injured
in a 1984 bombing in Nicaragua that he blames on the alleged
conspirators. He and his wife Martha Honey are represented by the
Washington-based Christic Institute, which Hall called a left-wing
organization.
   The magistrate said he respected Hall's position, but that he
must answer the questions.
   ``There really is no alternative for me but to make a
recommendation that you are held in civil contempt,'' said Turnoff.
He said Hall could be released any time he agrees to cooperate.
   ``You hold the keys to the jail,'' said the magistrate.
   Turnoff will make his recommendation to the presiding judge in
the case, Chief U.S. District Judge James L. King.
   The damage and racketeering suit charges that members of a
right-wing terror network tracing back to 1959 participated in
assassination plots, gun running and drug trafficking.
   Defendants include Singlaub; Theodore Shackley, former deputy
director of operations for the CIA; Contra director Adolfo Calero;
Medellin Cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa
Vasquez; Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord, Robert Owen and Albert
Hakim, and others.
   The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the
Iran-Contra affair became public. Many of those the suit brought to
light have since been indicted or appeared before congressional
committees investigating the Contra case.
   Avirgan and Honey accuse the defendants of funding illegal
Contra activities with drug runs in cooperation with the Medellin
Cartel, and threatening, imprisoning and even killing anyone who
might expose the ring.

<HEAD>France Completes Hostage Deal by Announcing Resumption of
Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France fulfilled a pledge made in a deal for
release of the last three French hostages in Lebanon by announcing
it will resume diplomatic relations with Iran on Thursday, 11
months after breaking them.
   Announcements made Wednesday in both Paris and Tehran said
ambassadors will be exchanged soon.
   How far France went to meet conditions set by Iran for
re-establishment of relations was not clear immediately. Ten French
hostages were freed at intervals over a two-year period of fitful
negotiations.
   Jean Gueguinou, chief Foreign Ministry spokesman, indicated the
decision would not hinder France's friendship with Iraq, with which
Iran has been at war since September 1980. Iran has demanded
neutrality from France, which is Iraq's main Western arms supplier.
   A ministry statement said: ``The government of the French
Republic and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran have
agreed to re-establish diplomatic relations beginning June 16,
1988. They have also agreed to exchange ambassadors shortly.''
   Years of stormy relations preceded the break in relations July
17, 1987 after Iranian Embassy employee Wahid Gordji refused to
turn himself in for questioning about a series of bombings in Paris
nearly a year earlier.
   Iran has been trying to break out of its diplomat isolation. The
last barriers to renewed relations with France were removed in the
deal made with former Premier Jacques Chirac's conservative
government for release of the last three French hostages held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats Marcel Carton and
Marcel Fontaine were freed days before the May 8 presidential
election in a move largely viewed as an electoral ploy.
   Chirac was the conservative candidate and lost to President
Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist who won a second seven-year term.
   In welcoming the three men home May 5, Chirac thanked Iran for
its role in the releases and said relations could be restored.
   Mitterrand ordered the process set in motion two weeks later.
Michel Rocard, the new Socialist premier, said his government found
no written record of the hostage deal but declared: ``France gave
its word. It will be kept ... for that which is known.''
   French and Iranian emissaries met in Geneva to work out what
Gueguinou, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said were ``technical
details and a timetable,'' suggesting that essential issues were
dealt with earlier.
   He said renewing ties ``does not imply any change in French
policy in regard to the problems of the region.''
   Chirac had made the freeing of French hostages a top priority
and the series of releases prompted charges that his government
dealt with the terrorists holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Eighteen foreigners still are captives in Lebanon, including
nine Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Iran had made normal diplomatic relations the price of using its
influence with the groups holding French hostages.
   As conditions for restoring ties, Iran demanded that France
repay, with interest, a $1 billion loan the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi made for a nuclear plant; stop harboring dissident
Iranians, and be neutral in the Iran-Iraq war. Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's fundamentalist regime overthrew the shah in February
1979.
   In June 1986, after one French hostage was freed, France
expelled Massoud Rajavi. He leads the People's Mujahedeen of Iran,
the main armed opposition group, and now is based in Iraq.
   France expelled 17 Mujahedeen supporters to Gabon in December
1987 after two more hostages were freed, but the expulsions later
were revoked because of public pressure.
   Two payments were made on the loan in 1986 and 1987, coinciding
in each case with the release of a French hostage.
   Then came the dispute over Gordji, which developed into
``embassy war'' in which the authorities in each capital besieged
the other's embassy.
   On Nov. 29, two days after two more French hostages were
released, Gordji was allowed to return to Tehran in exchange for
Paul Torri, first secretary of the French Embassy, whom the
Iranians had accused of spying.

   A mass funeral was scheduled Friday
for 13 of the 44 decomposing bodies found last week at funeral home
closed by state regulators after they found the corpses stacked in
a closet.
   In addition to the 44 bodies, 26 boxes of cremated remains were
found at the Howell Morning Glory Funeral Chapel, officials said.
   The Medical Examiner's Office on Tuesday turned over remains to
the Hardage-Giddens Funeral Homes for the mass funeral. The names
of the dead have not been released because next of kin are still
being notified, said Ronald L. Giddens, executive vice president of
Hardage-Giddens.
   State inspectors found eight decomposing bodies in a routine
check of the Howell mortuary June 6. They received permission from
the owner, Lewis J. Howell, to search the funeral home and
discovered the other bodies, many stacked in a closet.
   Although some of the remains were recent, a death certificate
showed one body had been dead since July 1978, said Dr. Peter
Lipkovic, the city medical examiner.
   Since 1979, Howell received $200,749 for burial and cremation of
indigents, receiving $400 for each adult burial and $100 for
cremation.
   It was not known however, if the decomposing remains belonged to
indigents. On Tuesday, Virgil Green, director of Jacksonville's
Welfare Division, said a member of his staff witnessed all indigent
services _ 62 burials and three cremations this year, and about 70
burials last year.
   The Florida Times-Union quoted Howell last week as saying it was
paperwork, not money problems, that caused the delay in burials.
Repeated calls to Howell's home and the mortuary for additional
comment have gone unanswered.
   Meanwhile, city accounting records show that several thousand
dollars in city funds meant to cover the costs of indigent burials
and cremations were paid directly to the Small Business
Administration to help Howell repay a loan. Howell had apparently
defaulted on the loan, and in 1984 the city paid $5,000 to the SBA
in exchange for Howell's burying 10 bodies in August and September
of that year, said Louise Squayars, who manages the payable
accounts for the city Finance Department.
   Riverside Memorial Park Cemetery, which is owned by Service
Corp. International, the parent firm of Hardage-Giddens, has agreed
to donate up to 37 burial plots, Giddens said. Giddens said
Hardage-Giddens will get $400 for each burial.

<HEAD>French Woman Claims To Be Grandmother Of Mystery Boy In Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French woman has told officials in Paris she is
the grandmother of a deaf boy whom American and Mexican authorities
have been trying to identify for more than six months, the U.S.
Embassy said Wednesday.
   Christopher English, chief of special consular services at the
embassy, said he was contacted Tuesday by a woman from a village in
the Normandy region who saw a picture of the boy on the television
news and recognized him.
   ``She called and calmly said she had reason to believe that she
was the boy's grandmother,'' English said.
   Authorities found the freckled, brown-haired boy, named Sabat by
his Mexican guardians, wandering near Juarez, Mexico, in November.
He had scars that looked about two years old and could have come
from home-treated injuries.
   He was unable to identify himself to authorities or say where he
was from.
   Sabat suffers from impaired hearing and communicates mostly by
drawing pictures and gesturing. His pictures seem to indicate he
survived the crash of a four-seat, single-engine airplane that
killed his parents and sister.
   After Mexican authorities noticed Sabat preferred hamburgers and
hot dogs over Mexican fare and responded more enthusiastically to
American cartoon characters, they contacted their Texas
counterparts.
   The story has received international media attention and
pictures of the boy have circulated in France, England, Mexico and
the United States.
   English said the French woman, who asked him not to release her
name until the child's identification is confirmed, provided the
address and telephone number for her son who lives in El Paso, not
far from where the boy was found.
   She said she had not spoken to her son for several months and
the telephone apparently was disconnected, said English who added
the son also is French.
   English said he called Terry Kincaid of the FBI in El Paso, who
checked out the address early Wednesday and found out the family
had moved in August 1987. They had also left the second address
without leaving a forward address.
   ``It is getting murkier and murkier,'' English said, adding that
the FBI was continuing to search for the family.
   The woman said her son was married to a Mexican woman and the
couple had three children. She had not seen them for several years.
She did not know whether the couple had American citizenship or
anything about their legal status in the United States.
   The woman's daughter, who lives in Paris, also recognized the
boy from pictures on the news, English said. He said the daughter
gave family snapshots of the boy to the embassy Wednesday which
would be forwarded to the FBI.
   Texas officials have said the boy is 7 or 8 years old. The
French woman said he was close to 12.
   English said that since news of the French woman's claims were
released his office had been deluged by phone calls from reporters
around the world.

   A 13-year-old boy who pleaded
guilty to breaking into a neighbor's house and stabbing her was
sentenced as an adult to 12 years in prison.
   Jason Williams of Hallandale was sentenced Tuesday by Broward
Circuit Judge Leroy Moe after he pleaded guilty to charges of
attempted first-degree murder and armed burglary.
   The boy, 5 feet, 100 pounds, twice stabbed 64-year-old Delores
Barber on Jan. 31 after borrowing a cup of sugar from her a few
hours earlier, authorities said.
   He had no previous record and lacked a motive, lawyers and the
judge said.
   Because of the violence of the attack, he was treated as an
adult. But he will not be imprisoned with adults, said Louis
Carmichael, a correctional services administrator. He will be put
in with younger inmates, few of whom are as young as he is.
   ``If he doesn't really understand why he did this, maybe he will
be able to figure it out,'' said Douglas McNeill, the boy's lawyer.
   Ms. Barber recovered from her injuries.

<HEAD>POLICE QUESTIONING^</HEAD>

   The court refused to narrow criminal suspects' so-called Miranda
rights when it barred an Arizona prosecutor from using an accused
burglar's confession as evidence against him.
   The court, on a 6-2 vote, said police may not question a suspect
after he has invoked his right to remain silent, even if they want
to talk about another crime.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in the majority decision, said Tucson
police in 1985 violated Ronald W. Roberson's rights by questioning
him about a burglary after he had refused to discuss another
burglary until conferring with a lawyer.

   The court kept alive a lawsuit by a gay CIA agent who claimed he
was fired only because he is homosexual.
   On a 6-2 vote, the court said the CIA director did not have
absolute discretion to fire employees whenever he deems it
necessary.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
the allegation of the employee, described in court documents only
as John Doe, may be reviewed in federal court since he alleged
violations of his constitutional rights.
   The case is Webster vs. Doe, 86-1294.

   The court expanded the financial liability of promoters of
business deals that go bad.
   Voting 7-1, the court ruled that Texas oilman Billy ``B.J.''
Pinter may not have to bear full financial liability for selling
unregistered oil and gas leases. The court said a promoter of the
deal, California real estate broker Maurice Dahl, who also bought
the securities himself, may be forced to share liability.
   The court overturned a ruling that favored the promoter and
ordered further lower court study of the case.
   The case is Pinter vs. Dahl, 86-805.

   In a victory for the Reagan administration and free-trade
advocates, the court ruled the government does not have to place
restrictions on imported uranium to help protect domestic producers.
   The unanimous ruling overturned a decision barring federal
officials from enriching foreign uranium for import into the United
States.
   Administration officials had argued that the ban seriously
jeopardized U.S. trade, nuclear cooperation and non-proliferation
policies and could limit the supply of fuel used to run electric
utility company nuclear reactors.
   The case is Huffman vs. Western Nuclear, 87-645.

Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee approved
legislation Wednesday to strip top political appointees in the
Interior Department of day-to-day control over the National Park
Service.
   The bill, reflecting increasing displeasure among committee
Democrats with the Reagan administration's handling of the national
parks, was cleared for floor action by a 25-14 partyline vote.
   The legislation would make the park service director a
presidential appointee, subject to Senate confirmation. A director
would serve a five-year term, could be removed only by cause and
would have to be knowledgable about managing natural and cultural
resources.
   Currently, the director is appointed by the interior secretary,
serves at the secretary's pleasure and is directly answerable to
the assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks. Both are
political appointees.
   The plan's principal advocate, Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said
the move would elevate the stature of the service's director,
putting that official on a more equal footing with the current
supervisors.
   The bill also would create a three-member park system review
board appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The
board would advise the director and Congress on how to improve the
park system.
   Budgeting for national parks would continue to be done through
the Interior Department, but the park service director would have
more direct access to the White House and Congress, according to
advocates of the changes.
   Vento says the changes are needed to counter years of
encroachment on park service professionals by political appointees
in Democratic and Republican administrations.
   But a background statement on the bill by Vento's national parks
and public lands subcommittee cited activities during the Reagan
administration as reasons why the legislation should be enacted.
The reasons included:
   _``Political appointees were substituted for professionals at
various levels and at different times, including the deputy
director'' of the park service.
   _``The assistant secretary's office changed performance ratings
of professional employees for political reasons.''
   _``The assistant secretary's office forced the resignation of
one regional director and forced the demotion of another for
political reasons.''
   _Park service ``personnel appearing before House committees
present testimony written by low-level political appointees in the
assistant secretary's office that rarely reflects the professional
views of the park service.''
   Vento said the situation has reached the point that park service
director William Penn Mott is not allowed to use the word
``threats'' in discussing problems faced by units of the park
system.
   The Interior Department opposes the bill, noting that the
Justice Department considers it an unconstitutional infringement on
the separation of executive and legislative branch powers.
   ``This bill is not going to go anywhere,'' said Rep. Don Young
of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the Interior Committee.

   The Democratic Platform Drafting Committee
will meet again in Denver on June 24, on the eve of a two-day
meeting of the full platform committee, the party said Wednesday.
   The 16-member drafting committee, chaired by Rep. William Gray
III of Pennsylvania, spent three days at Mackinac Island, Mich.,
last weekend hammering out working papers on key issues.
   Forces of Michael Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic
nominee, and presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson were divided over
whether the platform should call for a freeze on Pentagon spending
and a tax increase on the wealthy. They did agree, however, to
brand South Africa a terrorist state.
   Gray promised the participants Sunday they would get a chance to
vote on a draft platform sometime before the full 186-member panel
takes up the document June 25-26.
   Jackson has enough delegates to force floor fights on any issues
he chooses at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. The
convention will take up the platform on July 19, its second night.

   Israeli soldiers will be shown a film
documenting their abuses of reporters and Arabs in the occupied
lands to discourage such behavior and show troops how news reports
of brutality damage Israel's image.
   The 22-minute army film, entitled ``The Camera Sees All,'' shows
disturbing images of troops responding to stone-throwing by beating
Arabs, vandalizing their shops and tying Palestinian children to
jeeps.
   The images ``prove there is no law and order and that the army
has lost control,'' narrator Michael Karpin of Israel Television
says in the film.
   The army showed the film to foreign journalists on Wednesday at
the military's main headquarters in Tel Aviv.
   Army officials said commanders were ordered this week to show
the film to all soldiers serving in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   ``These pictures will be shown (by the media) over and over
again around the world. They show exceptional behavior which does
us much damage,'' narrator Michael Karpin of Israel Television says
in the film.
   ``Do not make the cameraman put you on stage. You are not an
actor. Western television, especially in the United States, works
by the principle of getting a picture at any price. If the reporter
is treated well he will give a balanced account,'' Karpin said.
   The movie was made in response to dozens of incidents in which
soldiers have been filmed vandalizing photographers' equipment,
speaking harshly to foreign newsmen and beating Arabs during the
six-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.
   The Foreign Press Association has complained of 150 cases of
physical abuse of foreign journalists since the unrest began Dec.
8. According to United Nations figures, 208 Palestinians have been
killed and two Israelis have died in the rebellion.
   ``This film will have a swift, shocking effect on soldiers
because the tough pictures show exactly what they have done
wrong,'' said Col. Raanan Gissin, an army spokesman.
   ``The message is, we don't want bad pictures. You can minimize
them if you behave correctly,'' Gissin said.
   In the film, Karpin urges soldiers not to cover camera lenses to
try to prevent pictures from being taken, and elite Golani troops
show how to politely steer reporters away from areas declared
closed military zones.
   The film tries to boost the image of foreign reporters by saying
their reports are usually fair and professional. It shows a foreign
cameraman helping weeping Israeli teen-agers in the West Bank
village of Beita after a clash between Jewish settlers and
villagers in which an Israeli girl was killed.
   The movie also runs through half a dozen of some of the worst
incidents of brutality since the uprising began.
   It shows Jewish settlers chasing Arab schoolgirls with their
pistols drawn, a soldier smashing the windows of a
Palestinian-owned clothing shop, and a trooper dragging an Arab
detainee by the hair and banging his head into a metal door.
   Another scene shows an incident filmed by the American CBS
network in the West Bank city of Nablus in February showing
soldiers beating Arab youths detained for stone-throwing.
   ``This is an extremely deviant incident,'' Karpin says. ``The
soldiers beat two detainees for 30 minutes.''
   ``The censor can ban pictures which are damaging to state
security, but the censor cannot ban transmission of ... a picture
of a soldier beating an Arab passerby,'' Karpin says.
   Western reporters ``will stress these pictures in their reports,
because television around the world stresses the unusual,'' the
narrator adds.
   The film also shows riot police breaking up protests in South
Korea and the United States in the 1960s, with Karpin saying:
``Viewers are used to seeing pictures of force used to quell
violence.''
   But, Karpin says, Western viewers are not used to seeing images
of troops beating unarmed Arabs or accosting foreign journalists.
``These only make the viewer sympathize with the party who is done
harm.''

   A Protestant loyalist paramilitary chief was shot
to death in Belfast on Wednesday, and the IRA said it killed him in
retaliation for attacks on Roman Catholics.
   The dead man was identified by the Royal Ulster Constabulary as
Bobby ``Blood'' Seymour, 33, a known gunman for the outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force.
   He was jailed for life in 1981 for the murder of a Catholic who
was believed to a high-ranking Irish Republican Army member.
Seymour was released when an appeals court dismissed an informer's
testimony.
   Several hours after Seymour was shot in an alley behind his
video shop in east Belfast by two masked gunmen who fled in a car,
the outlawed IRA made telephone calls to the media claiming
responsibility for his killing.
   The car used by the attackers later was found abandoned in the
Markets area of the city, and the police said a man arrested there
was being questioned about the slaying.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.

   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris, who has steered

doesn't plan to change his approach when he welcomes delegates and
the news media to next month's Democratic National Convention.
   During the July 18-21 convention, the conservative Democrat will

often has found too liberal.
   ``It is not that major,'' said Harris. ``We just want the people

   Harris also will host a brunch and a lunch for Democratic
governors and major party contributors at the Executive Mansion. As

convention locally, Harris plans to meet with national reporters at
a media party and will participate in the ``Victory Celebration''
party on the convention's final day.

   George Bush on Wednesday blamed his poor
showing in recent public opinion polls on a primary season filled
with Democratic candidates ``shooting at you every single day'' and
held out the possiblity that he might name a woman as his running
mate.
   The vice president, in an interview, also said that while he
would pursue President Reagan's efforts for the rebel Contra forces
in Nicaragua, ``I'd want to do it practically to see. Let's be sure
what we do will pass.''
   The adminstration has repeatedly encountered broad congressional
opposition to its attempts to provide military assistance to the
Contras.
   And, while the all-but-certain Republican nominee said he wasn't
advocating a change in direction from that policy, he suggested he
would try to work more closely with Congress.
   ``I'd love to find a way to take a package to the Hill and get
it passed,'' Bush said.
   Bush insisted that he still hasn't given thought to a possible
running mate, saying he will wait until after the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, July 18-21.
   ``The number one criterion is will this person be capable of
taking over if something happend to the president? Enough
experience, enough stature, to do that. But, having said that, man
or woman, I would say: look, the gender question was crossed when
Geraldine Ferraro went on the (Democratic) ticket (in 1984).
   ``And that was a good thing, a very good thing,'' he said.
   Asked if he would name a woman if polls suggested such a ticket
would help him, Bush said: ``Anyone who would help me in the polls
would be a factor _ a man or a woman.''
   Recent polls also show Bush receiving high negative ratings, but
the vice president said, ``I think the answer on the polls is, if
there are negatives there, to turn them into positives. By getting
out what I feel on the issues.''
   ``But when you're sitting out there in a primary process with
two candidates shooting at you every single day, and a lot of
editorial media attention on controversial matters, I think it
would be surprising if things were any different,'' he said.
   ``So I feel fairly relaxed about that. I think we have time to
be sure that a positive image is out on who I am and what I feel
and where I'll take the country. And I'll readily concede that some
of that's not that clear yet,'' he said.
   Bush said that his gender gap problem _ the fact that his
support is much weaker among female voters than among male voters _
should narrow in time as he speaks out on ``what I feel on peace
and some of the issues that may disproportionately concern women.''
   The vice president said he intends to address the issue in
campaign advertising and seek out prominent Republican women to
speak in his behalf.
   However, Bush said he did not intend ``to go off to some extreme
position in order to try to rectify what might be a gender gap.''
   ``Just spell out your concerns. People are interested in the
family. I've got a good one. I don't think we get credit for how we
manage family values yet. And what really motivates me. And caring
and compassion and all of that stuff,'' he said.
   Bush also said that, while he doesn't plan to overdo his efforts
to depict Dukakis as an ultra-liberal elitist for fear that it
might backfire, ``I've got to get people's attention.'' Bush said
he would mix rhetoric against the Democratic candidate with
``precise facts.''
   In a wide-ranging interview, Bush also called for an aggressive
investigation into allegations of bribery and fraud in the Defense
Department.
   ``It is essential that we get to the bottom of that, whatever it
is. Where there is smoke over there, see what fire is there and
clean that up. It is our commitment to getting rid of waste, fraud
and abuse that is leading to some of this inquiry,'' he said.
   The FBI disclosed Tuesday that its investigators bugged Pentagon
offices over a nearly two-year period before staging coordinated
raids there and at the office of defense contractors in 12 states.
The steps were part of a massive investigation of alleged fraud,
bribery and bid-fixing in military purchasing.
   Bush said that if elected, he would set up a presidential task
force on urban affairs with a membership made up primarily of
mayors.
   He made the proposal in a letter to the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, which is meeting this week in Salt Lake City. ``We need to
forge a new relationship. I intend to be an activist president
involved in helping you to find solutions,'' Bush said.
   ``Though massive amounts of federal aid are not available, my
goal is to shape a federal role that serves as a catalyst to help
the cities solve their problems,'' he said in the letter.
   He also said he would not make any structural changes in the
office of vice president, such as having the vice president head a
department. ``That would be bad government. (Former president)
Gerald Ford proposed making him (the vice president) chief of
staff. But I don't agree with that, either.''
   Bush has proposed making the vice president head of the
administration's anti-drug efforts.

<HEAD>Lebanese Official Says Syrian Attempt To Free Hostages Could
Backfire</HEAD>

   Syria could use its military might to pressure
pro-Iranian factions to release American hostages in Lebanon, but
the move might backfire against the captives, Lebanon's ambassador
to the United States said Wednesday.
   Asked if Syria could do more to bring about the release of the
hostages, Abdallah Bouhabib said: ``Physically, the answer is yes;
politically, I don't know.''
   Pro-Iranian Shiites believed to hold nine American hostages in
Lebanon might take reprisals against their captives if pressed too
hard by the Syrians, Bouhabib said at a briefing for reporters.
   Late last month, Syrian troops ringed the area of south Beirut
where the hostages are thought to be held, but did not try to gain
their release.
   Bouhabib said his only information about the hostages was that
they were alive in Beirut's southern suburbs under the control of
the Hezbollah faction and Iranian guards.
   The ambassador said he disapproved of negotiating with the
captors because that course spawned additional seizures. He blamed
Iran for the hostage-taking. ``That is Iran's brand of diplomacy,''
he said.
   Bouhabib said he had no knowledge of a report that the United
States had sent an envoy to Beirut to seek the hostages' release.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said he would have no
comment on the report that appeared in The Guardian newspaper in
London.
   ``I just stay with our position that we don't talk about
operational questions,'' Redman said.
   The Guardian, quoting Shiites sources in Beirut it did not
identify, said the envoy returned to Lebanon last Sunday for a
second round of secret talks with Hezbollah. The article did not
name the envoy.
   Terry Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent, is the
longest-held American hostage in Lebanon. He was captured in March
1985.
   The only concrete solution to ending hostage-taking, Bouhabib
said, is to restore order to strife-torn Lebanon where both the
Syrians and the Israelis have a military presence.
   The Lebanese are committed to the removal of all foreign forces
from their country, but they recognize that Syria will always play
a role in their future.
   Lebanese President Amin Gemayel, who has been working for
constitutional reform that would reconcile various factions in
Lebanon, does not intend to seek re-election when his term expires
in September.
   Constitutional reform has been put on the back burner until
after Lebanon's Parliament elects a new president sometime between
July 23 and Sept. 23, Bouhabib said.
   At least 12 people are seeking to succeed Gemayal.

   The leading industrial democracies plan to
take joint steps against terrorism and to assist Third World debtor
nations at their eocnomic summit next week in Toronto.
   Exercising the ``no-place-to-hide'' doctrine, the United States
and its six partners are expected to call on nations worldwide to
deny refueling to airplane hijackers, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said Wednesday.
   The idea is to prevent hostage-holders from taking off with
their victims, Shultz said in a U.S. Information Agency telecast
and at a White House news conference.
   ``It's a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be
helpful,'' he said.
   Shultz said joint action at past economic summit meetings had
helped send terrorism into a decline in Western Europe, although he
said there also were indications it might be on the rise elsewhere.
   Sharing the White House platform with Shultz, Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III predicted ``there's going to be real action on
economic issues,'' including decisions to ease the debt burden of
sub-Saharan African nations.
   Also, Baker said President Reagan and the leaders of Canada,
Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany would consider
cooperative measures to prevent drug dealers from laundering their
profits through legitimate banks and ways for governments to share
intelligence information on narcotics.
   On another front, however, Shultz indicated the United States
would resist any attempt to impose stiffer economic sanctions
against South Africa because of its racial policies.

<HEAD>Pentagon Mandating `Drug-Free Workplace' At Defense Contractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's defense contractors will soon be
ordered to provide a ``drug-free workplace'' for their 3.2 million
employees, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told Congress on
Wednesday.
   Carlucci's announcement came as he and the nation's uniformed
military leaders voiced strong opposition to new moves by Congress
to increase the Pentagon's role in the country's effort to halt the
use of illegal drugs.
   The hundreds of defense contractors would be required to develop
extensive education programs about the dangers of drugs and
employees with security clearances could also be required to
undergo mandatory drug testing, Carlucci said.
   An estimated 3 million workers on Pentagon contracts have
security clearances of various types. Carlucci did not say if the
testing would be required of all employees with clearances or just
those with the more sensitive access clearances.
   The nation's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel are now
subject to random, mandatory drug testing. Carlucci told a pair of
congressional panels those tests have been a key factor in sharply
reducing drug abuse among the military services.
   ``We have told our soldiers that drugs will not be tolerated in
the military and reported drug use has decreased at least 67
percent since 1980,'' Carlucci said. ``Ask our commanders and they
will tell you that drug testing works.''
   He said that ``it would be my intent to issue'' the regulation
covering contractors, but did not say exactly when the order will
be made.
   Carlucci testified before an unusual joint meeting of the House
and Senate Armed Services Committees, which are now trying to work
out a compromise version of a Pentagon budget bill for the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1.
   In its version of the bill, the House voted to tell Reagan to
order the Pentagon to essentially seal the U.S. borders against
illegal drug trafficking.
   The Senate bill did not go quite as far, but it did require the
Pentagon to provide more intelligence help to civilian anti-drug
agencies and also granted arrest powers to Navy officers aboard
warships which stop suspected drug boats in international waters.
   ``None of the interdiction approaches, in and of themselves,
will work,'' Carlucci said. ``I believe that these are not
solutions to the problem, but rather the result of our rising
frustration at our inability to find a real solution.''
   He said, ``I remain absolutely opposed to the assignment of a
law enforcement mission to the Department of Defense. I am even
more firmly opposed to any relaxation of the posse comitatus
restrictions on the use of the military to search, seize and
arrest.''
   ``I have discussed this matter with the president and other
senior members of his Cabinet and I can report that these views are
shared throughout this administration,'' he said.
   Carlucci was referring to the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law
which bars the military from enforcing civilian laws. Congress
amended the law in 1981 to permit the military to take a limited
role in the anti-drug effort, but the current proposals would
provide new exemptions to the law.
   ``Our armed forces should not become a police force, nor can we
afford to degrade readiness by diverting badly needed resources
from their assigned missions,'' Carlucci said.
   Air Force Gen. Robert T. Herres, vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said there were a ``number of myths'' which he
said gave rise to the belief that the U.S. military could halt drug
shipments.
   ``The first myth is that our defense forces include a seamless
network of radars'' along the border that could spot all ships and
planes, he said. ``We have a lot of holes in our air defense system
... there are all kinds of ways for planes to penetrate our
borders.''
   ``Another myth is that detecting enemy fighters and drug planes
is similar,'' he said, explaining that Soviet jets and bombers
generally fly high and fast, compared to drug planes that travel
much more slowly and closer to the water or ground.
   Asking the military to seal the borders ``is an unrealistic
expectation and a mission the armed forces cannot accomplish under
any foreseeable rules of engagement for within our own borders.''
   In another development Wednesday, the House Foreign Affairs
Committee approved legislation giving the government new authority
to withhold U.S. military and economic aid from countries suspected
of involvement in drug trafficking.
   The bill also would require the secretary of state to revoke the
passports of U.S. citizens convicted of violating drug laws.

   The jury hearing former Gov. Evan Mecham's
criminal trial began deliberations today after hearing the
prosecution describe him in closing arguments as a liar who blames
others for his failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Prosecutor Barnett Lotstein, who was likened to a guard at
Auschwitz on Tuesday by defense attorney Michael Scott, said
Scott's comment came from ``the desperation of the defense to
create an aura in the courtroom, because the facts do not support
their theory.''
   ``I'm not guilty of anything; neither is Willard,'' Mecham said
as he entered court.
   Mecham and his brother, Willard, are accused of concealing the
$350,000 loan on financial statements required by the state. The
defense has contended the loan was properly reported as part of a
$465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from Mecham.
   Lotstein told the jurors Tuesday that Mecham's attorney gave a
``laundry list of excuses'' but no valid explanation why the former
governor and his brother failed to report the loan on financial
reports required by the state.
   Lotstein bitterly criticized Scott for comparing him and
co-prosecutor Michael Cudahy, both assistant attorneys general, to
the guards at the Nazi death camp.
   Earlier Tuesday, Scott contended that Attorney General Bob
Corbin sought charges against the Mechams to boost his own
political ambitions.
   ``Perhaps I shouldn't be so hard on my colleagues (Lotstein and
Cudahy) because, like the guards at Auschwitz, they're just doing
their job,'' Scott told the court.
   Lotstein termed the statement a ``vicious personal attack'' and
added, ``It's not a new tactic. It's used when you don't have
anything else to say.''
   Willard Mecham's lawyer, Joe Keilp, contended the prosecution
had sought to prove its case ``by innuendo, not evidence.''
   ``How dare they try to sell you this shoddy merchandise and tell
you it's the truth,'' Keilp said. ``The only scheme to defraud in
this case ... has been perpetrated by the prosecution in trying to
get you to convict these men.''
   Cudahy told the Maricopa County Superior Court jury that Mecham
desperately needed the loan from developer Barry Wolfson to keep
his 1986 gubernatorial campaign afloat. However, he said Mecham
felt he could not make the loan public because it would destroy his
campaign theme of being ``beholden to no one.''
   ``Evan Mecham never had any intention of disclosing the Wolfson
loan,'' said Cudahy, who claimed the loan was hidden in a campaign
financial report as part of a``fabricated'' $465,000 lump sum
listed as a contribution from Mecham. Further, the prosecutor
pointed to a letter in which Mecham promised Wolfson the loan would
``remain confidential,'' as well as a receipt that was written a
month later and listed a $350,000 personal contribution from Evan
Mecham.
   Scott contended that the charges were based on the ``slimmest of
all evidence.'' He insisted there was no motive to conceal Wolfson
as the source of the loan because the financial report on which the
loan would have appeared was filed after the election.
   Scott noted that Mecham could have been charged under another
state law that makes false campaign finance reporting a
misdemeanor, ``but a misdemeanor is not good enough for Bob Corbin
and his henchmen.''
   Keilp said Willard Mecham ``is not the most sophisticated
bookkeeper in the world'' and filled out the financial statements
the best he knew how.
   But Lotstein contended that Willard Mecham lied when he told the
state grand jury he had never seen the letter in which Mecham
promised Wolfson the loan would remain confidential.
   Mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents and faced from almost nine
to 22 years in prison if convicted of all charges.
   Willard Mecham, who was his brother's campaign treasurer, faced
three similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison if convicted of
all charges.
   Mecham, a Republican, took office in January 1987 and was
removed April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of two
unrelated charges. He also was impeached in connection with the
loan, but the Senate decided not to hear that charge for fear of
prejudicing his criminal trial.

   A nationwide Communist Party conference will
discuss the Soviet Union's ethnic troubles but probably won't
consider Armenia's demand to annex a region of a neighboring
republic, two delegates said Wednesday.
   The party conference that begins June 28 is to take up a series
of theses approved by the party Central Committee last month,
including a statement calling for more attention and compromise on
difficult ethnic problems.
   About 5,000 party members will gather in Moscow against a
backdrop of continued tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   ``The issue of nationality relations will be debated at the
party conference,'' Vladimir Kluyev, a Moscow party official, told
reporters at a news conference sponsored by the government news
agency Novosti.
   But Kluyev, head of the party organization in the Lenin region
of Moscow, said he would be against reviewing a demand to allow
Armenia to annex Nagorno- Karabakh from Azerbaijan.
   Otto Latsis, deputy editor of the theoretical journal Kommunist,
said: ``It is necessary to discuss national relations, and what is
being done and what is going to be done,'' at the party conference
but the specific dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia should not
be brought up.
   The Supreme Soviet of Armenia approved a request Wednesday to
annex Nagorno-Karabakh, and Armenian activists said they are
waiting for a response from Moscow. Officials in the capital
already have turned down the request.
   A general discussion of ethnic problems at the party conference
is unlikely to satisfy ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and in
Armenia, who have rejected a special government aid package for
Nagorno-Karabakh as insufficient.
   When Communist Party authorities rejected the Armenian
annexation request in February, strikes and bloody ethnic violence
occurred in Armenia and Azerbaijan. On Feb. 28, riots broke out in
the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, and 32 people, mostly Armenians,
were killed.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called for a meeting of
the policy-making Central Committee to discuss ethnic questions,
which he described as one of the country's most crucial issues.
   The theses for the party conference approved by the Central
Committee said that ``inter-ethnic relations require constant
attention, as does the progress of every ethnic entity.''
   ``Inter-ethnic issues shall be settled on the basis of genuine
democracy, in the spirit of perestroika,'' Gorbachev's effort to
restructure the economy, the theses say.
   They called for development of a policy that would satisfy
ethnic interests while subordinating them to a spirit of equality
among all ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Patty Duke Makes Mid-Term Resignation As SAG President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patty Duke has resigned in the middle of her
second term as president of the Screen Actors Guild to produce a
movie based on her autobiography, ``Call Me Anna,'' the guild
announced Wednesday.
   Ms. Duke's resignation was effective immeidately. She was on
tour promoting the book and not available for comment.
   Guild by-laws state no officer or board member may hold a
production interest while in office.
   Ms. Duke was first elected president of the 70,000-member union
in November 1985 and was easily re-elected in November of 1987.
   Barry Gordon, Guild first vice president, will be acting
president until the board of directors holds its annual meeting in
December and elects a permanent replacement to complete Miss Duke's
term.
   ``Ms. Duke has worked tirelessly to project a positive image of
unionism at a time in our history when positive, aggressive
unionism is most needed,'' Gordon said.
   Ms. Duke's final speech as union president was Sunday at a SAG
mid-year membership meeting. She attacked management for refusing
to share with unions ``record profits for a record number of
companies, and record salaries for studio executives.''
   ``There has not been a single year in the 1980s when this
industry has not had a strike or been on the brink of one,'' the
actress said.
   Her resignation is the third time in the guild's history that a
president has stepped down to become a producer. The others were
Robert Montgomery in 1947 and Ronald Reagan in 1960.

   Legislation giving the government new
authority to withhold U.S. military and economic aid from countries
suspected of involvement in drug trafficking was approved on
Wednesday by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The bill also would require the secretary of state to revoke the
passports of U.S. citizens convicted of violating drug laws.
   Described as containing a series of ``modest new initiatives,''
the legislation will be included in a more comprehensive bill to be
considered by the full House later in the year.
   Committee staff members said the legislation is intended in part
to give specific authority to the Agency for International
Development to withhold economic and military aid from countries or
individuals known or believed to be involved in narcotics
trafficking.
   The bill also is intended to eliminate confusion in present law
on preventing aid from flowing to so-called ``drug transit''
countries.
   Other provisions include:
   _Making the secretary of state the coordinator of all overseas
anti-narcotics assistance.
   _Waiving present law to permit providing weapons to foreign
police units ``for anti-narcotics purposes only.''
   _Creating a special aid package for Colombia which is struggling
with powerful narcotics cartels.
   _Exploring the possibility of working with the Organization of
American States to create a multinational regional anti-narcotics
force.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., the committee chairman, said that
while the bill does not substantially increase spending for the war
on drugs, ``it does provide incentives for cooperating countries to
do more to help us.''

   The independent Bethel Home for Children in Lucedale was closed
Friday after allegations of child abuse and neglect.
   The home's operator, the Rev. Herman Fountain, is jailed on
three felony counts of assault of a law officer for scuffling with
George County sheriff's deputies and troopers who tried Monday to
take custody of children who returned to the home and serve
subpoenas on home staff members.
   Since Friday, state welfare officials have taken 77 children
from the home into custody. About 50 were later released to their
parents.
   Thomas Brittain, state welfare commissioner, said Wednesday that
he commonly gets telephone threats such as ``You're going to go to
hell and that sort of thing.''
   ``But here there was more specificity about what was going to
happen. The term children and my daughter was specifically
mentioned. ... Threats of kidnapping and putting her in a home
where she would never be found again,'' he said.
   Brittain said his daughter, Brandi, was moved about a week ago
after he had received three calls with specific kidnapping threats.
He said he had no idea who made the calls.
   ``We felt it just precautionary to move her, and she is
comfortable. Though she doesn't like being away and we don't like
it either, she'll remain out of state until all this has simmered
down,'' Brittain said.
   Brittain's other child, Thomas, 21, has remained at home.
   Fountain has told reporters he had about 120 children at the
home before Youth Court Judge Robert Oswald of Pascagoula gave the
state temporary custody of the youths on Friday.
   Oswald ruled the children, ages 10 to 17, had been subjected
``to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to
imprisonment.''
   Fountain has refused to give the Youth Court a list of the
children, claiming the home is part of his fundamentalist ministry
and exempt from state regulation because of the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of religion.
   The state has required that parents or guardians wanting to
regain custody must sign a statement promising not to send the
children back to Bethel.
   Fountain said in an interview that no more than 10 licks with a
switch were allowed and that other punishments permitted were
running laps _ no more than 25 _ and making students write
sentences over and over on the blackboard.

   Walter Hudson says he has lost half his
1,200 pounds, gained his confidence and is almost ready to leave
his house for the first time in 17 years.
   ``I'm ready for the outside world,'' Hudson said Wednesday,
leaning out a back window of his Hempstead home. ``I hope the world
is ready for me.''
   Hudson wasn't ready for the world, or even his front yard, in
February, when he turned down an offer from comedian-nutritionist
Dick Gregory to attend Gregory's clinic in the Bahamas. Hudson
already had lost several hundred pounds under Gregory's regimen,
but balked at leaving the house.
   Gregory took an interest in Hudson after he fell Sept. 14 and
became wedged in a doorway. Rescue workers had to saw out the door
frame to free him.
   Hudson said Wednesday he would step outside in August onto a
patio being built flush to his bedroom by volunteers.
   ``I'm going to clap my hands and praise God when I get
outside,'' said Hudson, 42.
   He said he has controlled his fear of losing his balance and
built up his confidence through hours of therapy.
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I feel like I've been paroled from
jail.''
   He said the first thing he wants to do is visit his mother's
grave, a few miles from his house, and then go to nearby New York
City.
   Hudson is being treated by a medical team led by Barbara Rosen,
a psychologist who specializes in weight disorders. She said the
600-pound weight loss _ like his original 1,200-pound weight _ is a
doctors' estimate because Hudson does not fit on conventional
scales.
   He is on a special liquid diet and fasts every other day.
   Rosen said Hudson overate because of anxieties that had built up
over years, then his body image created a feeling of shame and
embarrassment which made him hide from the world.
   ``His depression has lifted,'' Rosen said. ``He is a happier man
and wants very much to get out of that house.''
   Hudson says he has been outside only once in 28 years, 17 years
ago when he moved from Brooklyn to Hempstead, where he lives with
relatives.
   Patrick Hynes, a contractor from Lake Grove, broke ground this
week for the patio. Hynes said he is donating the project, worth
$9,000, because ``it feels good to help someone.''
   Hudson said he has set up in recent months his own hot line to
counsel people with weight, drug and alcohol problems.
   ``In helping them overcome their addiction, I think I have
helped myself,'' Hudson said.

<HEAD>White House Years Full of Thrills, Heartaches, Mrs. Reagan Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan offered a bit of advice to her
successor on Wednesday, warning the next first lady that she will
experience ``her greatest thrills and her greatest heartaches''
while in the White House.
   ``Life has been so magnified here,'' the first lady said.
``Sometimes it's been hard to comprehend what living in this house
really means. The day you come through the White House gates, your
life somehow becomes larger than life.''
   Mrs. Reagan addressed more than 100 women at the annual Senate
Wives' luncheon she traditionally holds at the executive mansion.
   Along with wives of most of the nation's senators, one possible
sucessor as first lady _ Vice President George Bush's wife, Barbara
_ was present. And seated next to Mrs. Bush was Elizabeth Dole, the
wife one-time presidential candidate, Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   Looking back over her eight years in the White House, the first
lady said she'd experienced a ``rollercoaster of emotions'' ranging
from the first inauguration to the ``absolute terror'' of the March
30, 1981, assassination attempt on President Reagan.
   Mrs. Reagan noted that within the space of a single week
recently she'd visited the Kremlin with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, Buckingham Palace with Queen
Elizabeth, 10 Downing Street with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and Disney World with a group of foster grandparents.
   ``Every one of those years has been fascinating in its own way.
... They've been truly remarkable years _ for both of us _ and ones
not given to many people,'' she said.
   ``It will be the same for the next first lady. And it will be
the cause of her greatest thrills and her greatest heartaches,''
Mrs. Reagan added.
   The first lady did not speak of the most recent controversy that
has dogged her, in particular her consultations with an astrologer
and the in-fighting with former White House chief of staff Donald
T. Regan, who disclosed the practice in his book, ``For the
Record.''
   She said she felt her most fulfilling years have come through
her work against drug abuse among youth, and she pledged to
continue her campaign once she leaves the White House.
   ``While I'm looking forward to California, I will miss
Washington, and I'll miss all of you,'' Mrs. Reagan told the
gathering.

<HEAD>Martinez Signs Parental Consent Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez signed a bill into
law Wednesday that will require unmarried girls under 18 to obtain
parental or judicial permission before getting abortions.
   The law also re-enacts regulations of the state's abortion
clinics and allows the Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services to revoke the license of any clinic that doesn't properly
dispose of fetal remains.
   Martinez, and representatives from several anti-abortion groups
who attended the bill signing, said the measure restored the rights
of parents to make decisions about their children.
   ``This has got to be seen as a victory for the children because
what child going through surgery should not have permission from
their parents,'' said Kay James, spokeswoman for National Right to
Life. ``Even pro-choice people ought to see this as a victory. This
is not about abortion.''
   Opponents of the law said it would lead to an increase in the
number of teen-age pregnancies and force some girls to go out of
state to seek abortions or prompt them to self-induce abortions.
   ``The parental-consent bill doesn't work,'' said Jerry Klein,
director of Planned Parenthood of Tallahassee. ``You end up with a
minor who delays telling the parent, you end up with a minor who
may seek an abortion out of state.''
   Under the new law, girls will be able to obtain permission from
a judge for an abortion. The so-called judicial bypass was designed
in cases such as incest.
   The law says the Supreme Court will develop rules to make sure
those cases are handled quickly and that the girls' anonymity is
protected.
   Klein estimated there were 10,000 teen-age abortions in Florida
in 1982, the latest available statistics.
   Tom Horkan, director of the Florida Catholic Conference, one of
several groups that lobbied hard for the parental-consent bill,
said at least seven other states have parental-consent requirements.

<HEAD>Bush Tired of Democratic Attacks; Dukakis Fires Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Wednesday he is ``sick and
tired'' of Democratic attacks on White House drug policies even as
Michael Dukakis declared Bush and President Reagan have ``lots of
answering to do'' for actions the Democrat said undermine the war
against drugs.
   Dukakis' presidential campaign signaled that Jesse Jackson is on
the list of those being considered for the vice presidential spot
on the Democratic ticket.
   Jackson met in Washington with Paul Brountas, Dukakis campaign
chairman and head of the search for a running mate for the
Massachusetts governor.
   ``It was a very meaningful preliminary discussion,'' Jackson
said in revealing the meeting.
   Dukakis aides say Brountas is meeting with a wide variety of
Democratic leaders in the search, not just possible vice
presidential candidates. But Brountas has met with most of the
Democrats mentioned for the No. 2 spot on this trip.
   Dukakis spent a third day in a row at anti-crime events in his
home state Wednesday, while Bush went to Capitol Hill for a news
conference on the war against drugs.
   ``How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs
when we're cutting Coast Guard patrols by 55 percent?'' Dukakis
said at the Massachusetts state police academy in Framingham.
``It's that kind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the
presidency.''
   He rejected suggestions that Bush and the Republicans could
portray him as soft on crime, noting that the Massachusetts crime
rate has dropped 14 percent in the past four years.
   ``Anyone who's been familiar with me for the past 5{ years knows
how strongly I feel on this...eternal vigilance is what's needed,''
he said after meeting with state police recruits.
   Dukakis said Bush and Reagan's actions over two terms suggest
the GOP might be vulnerable to such a charge.
   ``They've got lots of answering to do for what's been happening
over the past eight years,'' he said, but did not elaborate beyond
the Coast Guard budget cuts.
   On Capitol Hill, Bush accused the Democrats of making anti-drug
programs a ``shrill political issue'' and said congressional
Democrats were responsible for a $72 million cut in the Coast Guard
budget for drug patrols.
   ``I'm sick and tired ... in hearing the Democrats do nothing but
tear down and criticize. I'm talking about Jesse Jackson and
Michael Dukakis the last two months,'' Bush said at a news
conference where he endorsed a package of anti-drug measures
sponsored by House Republicans.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Bush
blamed his high negative ratings in the polls on Democratic attacks
and a fuzzy image the voters have of him.
   ``When you're sitting out there in a primary process with two
candidates shooting at you every single day...I think it would be
surprising if things were any different,'' Bush said. ``I feel
fairly relaxed about that...We have time to be sure that a positive
image is out on who I am and what I feel and where I'll take the
country. And I'll readily concede that some of that's not that
clear yet.''
   That sentiment was echoed by a group of 15 GOP state chairmen
who met with Bush and Reagan on Wednesday.
   ``Voters in the Midwest know nothing at all about Michael
Dukakis. When they find out, they won't vote for him,'' said
Indiana party chief Gordon Durnil.
   With Dukakis and Bush trading general election jibes, Jackson
rejected suggestions he should follow the lead of other vanquished
Democratic hopefuls and endorse Dukakis. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee will endorse Dukakis on Thursday.
   ``They lost and surrendered. I did not. We're not in the same
category,'' Jackson said after a meeting in Washington with civil
rights leaders. ``They surrendered their constituencies because
they lost. My constituency continues to grow...So we're still in
the process.''
   Jackson also said he would step up pressure on Dukakis to swing
the Democratic Party platform in line with his ideas.
   ``The most critical becomes this budget, a commitment to invest
in people, a commitment to reinvest in America,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson forces want the platform to include a freeze on military
spending and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to pay
for his social programs. Dukakis aides reject those ideas, saying
the Massachusetts governor is for stable defense budgets and would
raise taxes only as a last resort.

<HEAD>Armenians Win Legislative Support In Territorial Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Armenian legislature defied central Soviet
Communist Party authorities on Wednesday by siding with
demonstrators who for months have demanded annexation of a region
in a neighboring republic.
   The chairman of the Armenian Supreme Soviet, Gramt Voskanyan,
emerged from a five-hour session of parliament to announce the
decision to thousands of people gathered outside the legislature's
headquarters in Armenia's capital, Yerevan, according to a
television journalist.
   The parliamentary session was broadcast live on Armenian
television, a first for the republic. And the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported that the Armenian parliament ``decreed to give
its consent to the inclusion of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous
Region'' into the Armenian republic.
   The Tass dispatch, also read on the nationally broadcast
television evening news show ``Vremya,'' or Time, did not explain
the dispute.
   In Moscow, several hundred Armenians applauded and raised
clenched fists as Tiran Gureghian, the Armenian church
representative in the capital, told them the vote had been
unanimous to annex the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The region is
populated mostly by Armenians, who are Christian, but is located in
neighboring Azerbaijan, which is predominately Moslem.
   The vote by the Armenian parliament transforms the issue, which
has caused bloody ethnic violence, into a national constitutional
crisis, because the Soviet Constitution requires that all republics
concerned and the central government approve any territorial
changes.
   And central Soviet Communist Party authorities have already
rejected Armenian annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   It was far from clear whether the Armenians would be able to
wrest control of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan, to which it has
been attached since 1923.
   The Presidium, or executive committee, of Azerbaijan's Supreme
Soviet, voted Monday to reject the annexation demand, saying it
would ``be contrary to the interests of the Azerbaijani and
Armenian population of the republic.''
   The full Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan is to take up the issue
Friday, said the TV reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
It is unlikely the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet will go against the
wishes of its Presidium.
   Central Soviet Communist Party officials in Moscow rejected the
annexation demand in February, touching off ethnic violence and
strikes in Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The national parliament, the Supreme Soviet headed by President
Andrei A. Gromyko, has not addressed the issue.
   Thus the latest twist in the Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute puts
it at the heart of a debate now developing in the Soviet Union, the
balance of power between the legislature, which according to the
Constitution is supreme, and the Communist Party, which has run the
Soviet Union since its creation in 1917.
   The Armenian Supreme Soviet, in the resolution it passed
Wednesday, said that a majority of residents of Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh want the region taken out of Azerbaijan, according
to the TV journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's local legislature voted Feb. 20 to request
the transfer. The region's Communist Party committee endorsed the
move a month later, saying it had been wrong to make the area part
of Azerbaijan.
   More than three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's 160,000 people
are ethnic Armenians. Most Armenians are Christian while most
Azerbaijanis are Moslem.
   Gureghian, speaking from the steps of the red-brick church in a
Armenian cemetery, said Armenians would now wait for a decision by
national authorities: ``The people are united in their mood.
Everyone is waiting for a just decision.''
   The crisis has been costly. On Feb. 28, riots broke out in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, and 32 people, mostly Armenians, were
killed. The Armenian Supreme Soviet resolution passed Wednesday
condemns that violence and offers condolences to relatives of the
victims, according to the TV journalist.
   Additionally, official press reports said strikes in Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh have damaged the area's economy.
   The turmoil puts Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
administration in a political quandry: if it agrees to transfer
Nagorno-Karabakh, it will anger Azerbaijanis. If it rejects the
demand, Armenians will be incensed.
   The bitter ethnic dispute has been an important test of
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' which encourages the Soviet
people to speak out.
   ``Moscow will now have to play the role of an arbitrator,'' a
correspondent for the Armenian Communist Party newspaper Kommunist
said. He spoke by telephone from Yerevan on condition he not be
identified.
   The unrest over the dispute continued Wednesday. More than 150
students remained outside Yerevan's Opera Theater, staging a sit-in
they began May 25, the Kommunist reporter said.
   The TV journalist estimated that 1 million people from Armenia
gathered Wednesday in Yerevan's streets to monitor the Supreme
Soviet session.

   Vice President George Bush on Wednesday
endorsed a House GOP plan to severely punish narcotics users, then
accused Democratic presidential candidates of making a ``shrill
political issue'' of anti-drug programs.
   ``I'm sick and tired ... in hearing the Democrats do nothing but
tear down and criticize'' Reagan administration anti-drug efforts,
Bush said. ``I'm talking about Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis
the last two months.''
   Standing with some 50 House Republicans, the all-but-certain GOP
presidential nominee turned a news conference on their plan into a
blistering partisan attack. He declared the proposed package
``better than anything the Democrats are going to dream up.''
   Included in the proposal are recommendations to take away
driving licenses of those convicted in drug cases, fine them up to
25 percent of their adjusted gross income and net assets, and make
them ineligible for federal contracts, loans or licenses.
   Answering reporters' questions, Bush said he supports the
administration's ``zero tolerance'' policy of seizing property when
even a small amount of illegal drugs is found. He said, ``If some
yacht owner is inconvenienced, it's too damn bad.''
   He challenged Dukakis, his likely presidential rival this fall,
to endorse a section of the plan calling for the death penalty for
drug kingpins.
   Dukakis, who has said capital punishment wouldn't help,
lambasted the administration's drug-fighting effort earlier
Wednesday in Framingham, Mass.
   In particular, he criticized cuts in funds for the Coast Guard,
saying, ``How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on
drugs when we're cutting Coast Guard patrols by 55 percent. It's
that kind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the
presidency.''
   Bush, however, blamed congressional Democrats for a $72 million
cut in the Coast Guard budget for drug patrols.
   The vice president said the military can do more in the
anti-drug effort, but added ``I have trouble'' with proposals for
the military to arrest civilians.
   The GOP plan would:
   _Make anyone convicted of a drug trafficking offense or of two
drug possession offenses ineligible for federal grants, contracts,
loans, or licenses for five years.
   _Create a civil fine of up to a quarter of the adjusted gross
income and net assets of anyone caught possessing illegal
substances.
   _Require that before a state could receive federal highway
money, it must enact laws to suspend a driver's license upon
conviction of a drug offense.
   _Require that before receiving a federal contract or federal
assistance a company must show a good-faith effort to maintain a
drug-free workplace.
   _Mandate drug testing for all federal arrestees in drug cases,
and revocation of bond if the result is positive. A clean drug test
would be a condition to federal probation, and parolees would be
tested at random.
   _Increase drug abuse treatment services.
   _Authorize grants for states that establish innovative anti-drug
programs.
   _Require a 10-year prison term for using a firearm in an assault
on a federal officer, and prohibit possession of a firearm in a
U.S. courthouse.
   _Require governors to use the national guard in assisting drug
enforcement efforts.
   _Increase penalties for train or other transportation operators
convicted of operating their vehicles while under the influence of
alcohol or drugs.
   _Increase the military's role in drug interdiction, a proposal
identical to legislation already passed by the House.

<HEAD>Administration Recommends Rule Changes To Increase Cable
Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's cable TV industry increasing is
controlled by a few large companies, the Reagan administration said
Wednesday in a report recommending rule changes to increase
competition.
   The report by the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, a Commerce Department agency, said opening local
cable TV markets to more competition would reduce growing concerns
about ownership trends in the industry that may give large cable
companies excessive power to influence program distribution.
   Only a handful of communities offer residents a choice of cable
TV services, and outdated regulations serve only to perpetuate
monopoly franchising, said Alfred C. Sikes, assistant commerce
secretary for communications and information.
   ``Let's get more competition so we can have marketplace
solutions and not government regulatory solutions,'' Sikes said.
His agency is responsible for developing U.S. information and
communications policy, and the report was the Reagan
administration's first review of the cable TV industry.
   The head of the Federal Communications Commission praised the
report's conclusions, which generally propose the same deregulatory
course the commission has followed during the Reagan administration.
   ``Competition and open entry regulate best,'' Dennis R. Patrick,
FCC chairman, said in a statement. ``They guarantee responsiveness
to consumer demand and are the most effective safeguards against
market power.''
   The National Cable Television Association called the report
``interesting reading,'' but disagreed with some of its
recommendations, including a proposal that would give telephone
companies more freedom to provide transport facilities for cable TV
in their local service areas.
   The report says allowing phone companies to provide ``video dial
tone'' would allow anyone, including Hollywood studios, sports
organizations and broadcasters, to lease video channels to
distribute programs to subscribers.
   The report recommends elimination of a law that permits local
phone companies to lease channel capacity only to cable companies
that have a local cable franchise. It also recommends, however, no
change in laws that prohibit phone companies from owning cable
systems.
   The cable association says the proposal would put at a
disadvantage franchised cable companies, which pay a portion of
their revenues to the local municipal governments and which must
meet other community requirements.
   ``We don't want someone out there competing with us when they
don't have the same requirements imposed on them as we do by the
cities,'' cable association spokeswoman Lynn McReynolds said.
   The report also recommends eliminating a regulation that
prohibits TV networks from owning cable systems. The report says
national programming and advertising markets have become more
competitive since the 1970 ban was imposed.
   In addition, the agency recommends the FCC investigate ownership
concentration in the cable industry and consider taking steps to
limit cable ownership.
   Cable TV is available to about 80 percent of American homes.
About half of those households, an estimated 42.7 million,
subscribe to cable.
   The report noted that Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's
largest cable company, owning or controlling systems with about 10
million subscribers, has seen its share of the market grow from 9.1
percent in 1983 to 23.4 percent last year. The company's share more
than doubled from 1986 to 1987.
   The second-biggest cable company, American Television &
Communications Corp., owns or controls systems with about 4.4
million subscribers; Continental Cablevision Inc. is third, with
2.2 million subscribers; Cox Cable Communications and Storer
Communications have about 1.5 million each; and Warner Cable and
Comcast Cable Communications each have about 1.4 million.

   Some Texas Democrats are planning to serve
bologna to fellow party members in the hotel suite that Vice
President George Bush lists as his legal residence.
   Democratic National Committee member Billie Carr of Houston and
Austin party activist Ty Fain have rented the Houstonian Hotel
suite that Bush cites as his legal address.
   ``It's baloney for him to claim his residence is Texas,'' Carr
said.
   To illustrate their opinion, the two plan to serve bologna at
the suite to fellow Democrats Friday in conjunction with the Texas
Democratic Convention, which begins that evening in Houston.
   Bush, who has wrapped up the GOP presidential nomination, lived
in Texas for years but hasn't owned a local residence since
becoming vice president in 1981. He was born in Massachusetts, grew
up in Connecticut, has a vacation home in Maine and votes in
Houston.

   Pat Robertson is predicting a quick
return to financial health for his Christian Broadcasting Network,
which suffered when he left it to run for the Republican
presidential nomination.
   Still, Robertson said in an interview published Wednesday in the
Daily Press of Newport News, ``We're in serious trouble here. If
the decline had continued over a period of a year or so, the
survival of this organization would have been very much in doubt.''
   Robertson, who founded the network almost 30 years ago,
collected less than 50 delegates after spending nearly $27 million
on his campaign, which he suspended last month.
   ``I do not wish to get back into politics,'' Robertson said.
``Politics is not fun. CBN is fun.'' He did not, however, rule out
another run for the presidency.
   ``I'm not going to rule anything out because I just don't know
what is going to happen,'' he said.

   Unwelcome passengers are bugging commuters on
city buses, say officials trying to get rid of a cockroach invasion
blamed on hot weather and garbage left by riders.
   ``These roaches have been using little cracks and crevices for
their little homes when the weather was not so hot,'' Chicago
Transit Authority spokeswoman Rosemarie Gulley said Wednesday.
   With summer approaching, the authority is painting and doing
other maintenance that destroys the varmints' homes, she said.
   ``Once we throw paint on them, they go running.'' The transit
authority has to deal with the problem somehow, she added, since
``we cannot count on our riders to starve them,'' despite an eating
ban on buses.
   ``For people who want to become squeamish about it, it's not a
health hazard, and it's not a safety hazard,'' she said.
   Cockroaches have been found on about 40 of the agency's more
than 2,000 buses, she said. They show up every year when the
weather turns hot.
   The agency routinely sprays insecticide in the buses, but this
year's roach crop is resistant to the poison, she said. A shortage
of dumpsters at a South Side bus terminal also contributed to the
garbage problem, she said.
   ``A couple of riders spotted a cockroach or two or three,'' Ms.
Gulley said, but ``to call it an epidemic is overstating the case.''
   Still, the problem is serious enough to have made the agency
look for a stronger insecticide and haul more dumpsters to the
terminal.
   And the buses put out of commission for spraying added another
bug to the city's attempts to control a recent shortage of usable
buses.
   Tuesday, 61 bus runs were canceled and 64 other buses ran late
because of a vehicle shortage.
   But transit authorities say it was due mainly to a lack of
replacement parts and delays in structural overhauls.
   Ms. Gulley said it's too soon to tell how well the new
insecticide is working.
   At least one insect expert predicts riders may have to wait
until winter for relief.
   ``There are enough areas back behind the paneling and walls and
under the floors of buses that roaches find places to hide,'' said
entomologist Philip Nixon of the University of Illinois Cooperative
Extension Service in Champaign.

   Israel's army closed schools and ordered
Arab-owned bus companies off the streets Wednesday after Arabs shut
down the occupied territories in solidarity with thousands of
jailed Palestinians.
   Troops killed a 21-year-old Arab who was blocking a West Bank
road to force workers to stay home from their jobs, the army said.
It said another Arab was wounded by army gunfire.
   The commercial shutdown was called for in a widely distributed
underground Palestinian leaflet.
   The strike's success appeared to anger military leaders, who
closed West Bank schools for two days. They also closed 16
Arab-owned bus companies in east Jerusalem and the West Bank for a
week beginning Thursday because they had participated in the strike.
   If protests continue, ``(the Arabs) will all be sorry about
it,'' said the military government chief, Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez.
   Palestinian leaders said the school closings and bus ban would
not slow six months of Arab protests against 21 years of Israeli
occupation.
   ``The uprising will continue because it is the key to our
future,'' said deposed Nablus Mayor Bassam Shakaa, who lost his
legs in a 1982 attack by Jewish terrorists.
   Also Wednesday:
   _Israel's chief fire official, Rami Kachalon, said his office
had recorded 2,500 forest and brush fires since May 15, most set by
Arab activists. ``We ask all the public to mobilize because of this
emergency situation,'' said Yaacov Markovitz, the government
official in charge of firefighters.
   _Leaders of Israel's tourism industry held an emergency meeting
with Tourism Minister Avraham Sharir to try to reverse a 40 percent
decline in visitors to Israel so far this year.
   _The army showed journalists a documentary film about Israeli
army brutality that will be viewed by all soldiers who serve in the
occupied lands. The film, which focuses on abuse of Arab civilians
and journalists, is intended to teach troops how to avoid such
behavior.
   Wednesday's fatality occurred in Battir, five miles northwest of
Bethlehem, where 40 youths blocked a road with boulders and
overturned trash barrels to make sure Arab workers participated in
the strike, said villager Ribhi Mustafa.
   When Israeli troops arrived on the scene, the Palestinians began
throwing bottles and stones, said Mustafa and an official at nearby
Beit Jalla Hospital.
   Soldiers responded first with tear gas and then fired live
ammunition, hitting Nidal Ibrahim Hassan in the head and killing
him, said the hospital official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The army confirmed Hassan was the dead man and said troops shot
him after he hurled a firebomb. A military spokesman said troops
wounded another Palestinian who was about to throw a firebomb.
   The death brought to 208 the number of Arabs killed since the
uprising began Dec. 8. Two Israelis also have been killed.
   Wednesday's strike was virtually universally observed among the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip's 1.5 million Palestinians, as well as
in east Jerusalem.
   In Bethlehem, graffiti on walls said in Arabic: ``Observe The
Strike, Or Else!'' In Nablus, outlawed Palestinian flags flew from
electrical poles.
   The army released figures Wednesday showing 7,800 Arabs now are
held in Israeli detention centers and 2,500 of those are under
administrative detention, which permits jailing for six months
without trial.
   Hanan Ashrawi, an English teacher at the West Bank's Bir Zeit
University, said the effectiveness of the strike showed the
intefadeh, Arabic for uprising, was still alive.
   ``It is wishful thinking for the Israelis to say the uprising is
dying,'' she told The Associated Press. ``To end the occupation,
people are willing to sacrifice.''

   State Republican leaders met Wednesday with
President Reagan and Vice President George Bush and reported both
are enthusiastic about Bush's chances in November.
   Fifteen state GOP chairmen and chairwomen met privately with
Reagan after having breakfast with Bush, who has locked up his
party's presidential nomination.
   ``The president's very agressively supporting Vice President
Bush, and indicated that he (Reagan) would be involved in all of
our states,'' said Indiana GOP Chairman Gordon Durnil.
   The officials said Reagan was not specific about his campaign
plans on behalf of Bush.
   Bush said he is not worried by recent polls showing him behind
the expected Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, said New Jersey state Chairman Robert Franks.
   ``He believes the campaign is on track, though there are problem
spots. He's confident voters will embrace his vision of America,''
Franks said.

   The New Jersey National Guard commander
apologized Wednesday for a recruitment letter which was
accidentally sent to a 91-year-old World War I veteran and hundreds
of other men too old or too disabled to enlist.
   The World War I soldier, whose name was not released by state
officials, wrote that he was ``flattered,'' but the state's
adjutant general, Maj. Gen. Francis R. Gerard, said he feels some
of the other ineligibles are upset.
   ``There's enough for us to be concerned about and to publicly
apologize. I wish we could have avoided it,'' Gerard said. ``It is
something that is very embarrassing to happen.''
   ``Some people were originally concerned about the cost or felt,
`Don't you know I'm 70 years old?' or `Don't you know I'm 67 years
old?,''' said Ray Martyniuk, a spokesman for the state Department
of Veterans Affairs and Defense.
   The New Jersey Army National Guard needs recruits because only
80 percent of its 13,000 authorized positions are filled. The unit
is considered ``combat effective'' at 85 percent. Officials say New
Jersey's booming economy and low unemployment rate are primarily
responsible for the shortage.
   The mailing, which included an appeal signed by Gov. Thomas H.
Kean, went out nearly two weeks ago to 300,000 New Jersey veterans.
The guard targeted this group in order to save the $40,000 in
training costs incurred every time someone with no military
experience enlists.
   A ``concerted effort'' was made to purge from the mailing list
veterans over 41 years old, those who receive disability checks,
and other ineligibles, but the names of hundreds, and possibly more
than a thousand, ``inappropriate candidates'' slipped through, much
more than expected, Gerard said.
   ``It is quite evident ... that the realities of mass mailing
produce a certain percentage of error,'' Gerard said.
   The direct mail campaign cost $203,000, but will pay for itself
if only six veterans enlist, Gerard said. So far, the response has
been promising: More than 2,800 veterans have written or called the
guard, expressing an interest in signing up.
   Even the ineligibles who received letters and contacted the
guard were satisfied once they received an explanation, Martyniuk
said.
   Other veterans, like the World War I soldier, were thrilled, or
in some cases amused, to get the letter and the accompanying
``certification of appreciation'' from the governor.
   ``I am tremendously flattered by Gov. Kean's offer,'' said
Albert Marks, 75, a World War II veteran. ``If he would offer me a
star at my age _ all I would like is one star _ I would consider
it.''
   Harry Romano, 67, of West New York, said he was surprised to
find the letter in his mail, and added, ``I don't even think I can
hear the bugle in the morning.''

   Rebel archbishop Marcel Lefebvre
threatened the first split in the Roman Catholic church in 118
years by announcing Wednesday he will consecrate four bishops June
30 without papal authority.
   The 82-year-old traditionalist said he can ``no longer trust
Rome.''
   Bishop Henry Schwery, president of the Swiss Conference of
Bishops, has said such a breach of discipline would formalize a
schism. It would be the first since the Old Catholics left the
church in 1870 because they did not accept papal infallibility.
   Pope Paul VI barred Lefebvre in 1976 from saying Mass and giving
the sacraments, but the archbishop has ordained more than 200
priests who continue to use the 16th century Tridentine Mass, a
Latin rite for which special permission is required.
   Lefebvre's declaration Wednesday followed months of efforts at
reconciliation sponsored by Pope John Paul II.
   Joaquin Navarro, the Vatican spokesman, said Wednesday in Rome
the ``sad announcement'' has ``serious canonical consequences and
makes inevitable procedures for warning those involved.''
   ``The Holy See is also following with particular concern the
faithful who have chosen this option, which puts them outside the
ecclesiastical communion,'' he said in a statement.
   Lefebvre has rebelled against what he calls ``self-destructive''
church reforms for nearly two decades. He made clear Wednesday he
would not be impressed by excommunication, which is considered a
certainty after the consecration.
   ``It does not have any value,'' he told a news conference in
this village, where he founded his traditionalist St. Pius X
Fraternity in 1970. Pius X, who was pope in 1903-14, condemned
religious modernism and opposed anticlerical laws in France.
   ``Who is to excommunicate us?'' Lefebvre asked. ``A modern Rome
that no longer sticks to the Catholic faith, which now longer
thinks Catholic? We are being excommunicated by the modernists, by
the people who really should be excommunicated.''
   Only popes are empowered to name bishops. Canon law says
consecrating a bishop without papal permission is grounds for
automatic ejection from the church of both individuals.
   Excommunication is the last and most drastic sanction left in
the Vatican's arsenal of disciplinary measures against Lefebvre.
   He has pointedly ignored the papal order of 1976, both by
ordaining priests and continuing to speak against the reforms
adopted by the Second Vatican Council of 1963-65, which simplified
and modernized the liturgy.
   Lefebvre said he would have no more contacts with the Vatican
before the June 30 ceremony at Econe, which is to take place the
day after ordinations of more priests.
   ``Rome is setting a trap for us,'' he asserted. ``It is no
longer possible to trust Rome.''
   He apparently referred to the efforts by John Paul since last
fall to get the traditionalists back into the fold by offering to
lift sanctions in return for a face-saving formal acceptance of the
reforms.
   Those efforts culminated in the signing of a protocol May 5
intended to be the basis of a settlement, but two weeks later
Lefebvre sought more negotiations on points he considered as too
restrictive.
   When the Vatican did not respond, Lefebvre advised John Paul he
would proceed with the consecretions in order to ``ensure
continuity of the church,'' a well-placed source in the
traditionalist movement said privately.
   The movement claims to have 70 centers around the world with
seminaries in Switzerland, the United States, France, Argentina and
West Germany, and more planned for Gabon, Mexico and Australia.
   Priests using the Tridentine rite are said to be conducting
Masses in 28 countries.
   No firm statistics on the number of followers are available, but
Lefebvre says millions of Catholics support him. A West German
opinion poll in 1982 indicated 57 percent of respondents
sympathized with some traditionalist concepts.
   Even less clear is how many Catholics who support the rebel
archbishop would be willing to suffer excommunication for him.
   Lefebvre said he is not worried about the future, declaring
Wednesday: ``The fight will continue. We will continue to have
seminars, to ordain priests. That is what is important.''
   He said the bishops to be consecrated June 30 are the Rev.
Bernard Tissier de Mallerais of France, secretary-general of the
traditionalist fraternity; the Rev. Richard Williamson, head of the
Traditionalist Center in Ridgefield, Conn., who is a British-born
convert from the Anglican church ordained by Lefebvre in 1976; the
Rev. Bernard Felley of Switzerland, chief administrator of the
fraternity; and the Rev. Alfonso de Galarreta of Argentina.

   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader,
urged China on Wednesday to grant limited independence to his
homeland while retaining the right to run its foreign affairs and
maintain troops there.
   During a visit to the European Parliament, the Buddhist
spiritual leader said: ``complete independence (for Tibet) is very
difficult to achieve.''
   ``Now is the time to find a middle way,'' he added.
   The Tibetan leader's call for a negotiated settlement under
which China can keep a hand in Tibet's affairs signaled a shift in
policy. To date, he has made little mention of Chinese interests in
Tibet and has never accepted China's military presence in the
country or its right to run its foreign affairs.
   The Dalai Lama urged China, which invaded Tibet in 1949, to make
Tibet ``a self-governing, democratic political entity ... in
association with the People's Republic of China (which) could
remain responsible for Tibet's foreign policy.''
   ``Until such a peace conference can be convened and
demilitarization and neutralization achieved, China could have the
right to maintain a restricted number of military installations in
Tibet,'' he said.
   ``We are prepared to meet with the Chinese to discuss details of
such a proposal aimed at achieving an equitable solution,'' the
Dalai Lama said.
   The Tibetan leader, 53, made his remarks in a speech prepared
for delivery to the European Parliament. He did not address the
full parliament, but spoke in a conference room in the parliament
building to 200 people, journalists and parliamentarians after
distributing copies of his speech.
   The parliamentarians gave him a standing ovation.
   Last October, the parliament urged China to respect Tibet's
right to self-determination and invited the Dalai Lama to speak to
the legislature. But parliament withdrew the formal invitation
after Beijing canceled a visit a parliamentary delegation had
planned to China for later this year.
   The Dalai Lama proposed a democratic government for Tibet under
an elected president, with a bicameral legislature and an
independent judiciary.
   ``I will not participate or seek any position in the (proposed)
government,'' he told reporters. ``I am not concerned about
myself.''
   According to the Dalai Lama China has 300,000 troops in Tibet.
Western estimates put the number at tens of thousands.
   Chinese Communist troops invaded Tibet in 1949. They crushed an
uprising in 1959, forcing the Dalai Lama to flee to India with
thousands of other Tibetans.
   Since last fall, Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, has seen two major
anti-Chinese protests in which dozens of Tibetans and Chinese were
killed and hundreds of Buddhist monks, who led the rebellion, were
reportedly arrested.
   The Dalai Lama said although many Tibetans would be disappointed
by his ``moderate'' stand, his proposals were ``the most realistic
means by which to reestablish Tibet's separate identity and restore
the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people while accommodating
China's own interests.''
   He also praised recent changes in China ``which have brought
about a new group of leadership, more pragmatic and liberal.''
   But referring to the recent riots, he said: ``Unless China
forsakes the brutal methods it employs, Tibetans cannot be
responsible for a further deterioration in the situation.''
   China claims Tibet has been part of its empire for more than six
centuries. Tibetan activists say Tibet is an independent country
with its own language, culture and traditions.
   During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, bands of Chinese
radicals, called Red Guards, destroyed most of Tibet's Buddhist
temples and killed monks.
   After the fall of the ultra-leftist Gang of Four, conditions in
Tibet improved as Tibetans were allowed to travel from village to
village and the state began putting more money into the region.
   Lord Plumb, the parliament's president, said Tuesday an official
visit by the Dalai Lama was not ``helpful'' as the parliament seeks
to improve its ties with China, which he is due to visit in July.
   The Dalai Lama, in Strasbourg on a private visit at the
invitation of Lady Elles, a British Conservative parliamentarian,
is on a 16-day tour of Europe. On Tuesday, he met with Pope John
Paul II.

   A settlement in excess of $175,000 was
reached in a lawsuit filed against the heavy metal band Motley Crue
by two boys, one of whom lost an eye during a 1986 ``Theater of
Pain'' concert.
   Jim Corder, an attorney for one of the youths, said Motley
Crue's insurer, Fireman's Fund, will pay an undisclosed sum to
Robbie Miller, now 17, of Athens, and David Wright, now 19, of
Grant.
   The settlement will allow both sides to avoid a second trial.
The first ended with a deadlocked jury.
   Corder said most of the settlement will go to Miller, who was
blinded in one eye during the concert, allegedly when dry ice or
other debris flew off the stage during a pyrotechnic display.
Wright suffered facial cuts.
   Corder said the financial settlement is larger than $175,000,
but he said the agreement stipulated that the amount not be made
public.
   The two boys had asked for about $1.2 million in damages from
the band and other defendants, including the city of Huntsville,
concert promoter Sound Seventy Prodctions Inc. of Nashville, Tenn.,
and the Von Braun Civic Center.
   Before a mistrial was declared in the first trial, Circuit Judge
Henry Blizzard had dismissed charges against all defendants except
the heavy metal band and its members, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Tommy
Lee and Vince Neil.
   Sixx, the band's bass guitarist, was the only band member to
attend the trial. Crowds of young people came to court seeking his
autograph.

   House members urged their negotiators on
Wednesday to accept Senate legislation imposing random drug and
alcohol testing on the 3.3 million employees of the airline,
railroad and trucking industries.
   The 377-27 vote will have no legal effect because the resolution
was non-binding. But it adds momentum to the efforts of lawmakers
seeking to spread drug testing requirements, and gave them another
opportunity to participate in what has become a popular
election-year exercise of voting against drug abuse.
   The two chambers have been locked in a dispute over the testing
measure since October, when it was approved by the Senate. Because
of the standoff, a bill that would require airlines to provide more
flight information to passengers _ of which the drug testing
language is a part _ has been bogged down in a House-Senate
negotiating committee.
   Supporters of the testing proposal say the threat of random
examinations would deter transportation workers from using drugs
and alcohol, and thus help prevent accidents.
   ``We cannot allow one more disaster to happen while the House
and Senate quibble over the importance of this amendment,'' said
Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., who sponsored the non-binding
measure.
   Members of the House negotiating team have argued that testing
is an invasion of privacy, and that laboratory techniques are not
error free and could jeopardize the careers of workers by producing
false results.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., sponsor of the testing provisions
passed by the Senate, said the House vote would put pressure on
that chamber's members to finally approve the drug and alcohol
requirements.
   He also said he will look for other legislation to which he
could attach the testing proposal, in an effort to increase its
chances for receiving final congressional approval.
   ``Anything that moves, we'll add it,'' he said in an interview.

   About 8,000 people marched behind a
motorcade carrying the body of Ferdinand Marcos' mother on
Wednesday to honor the matriarch and to show support for the former
president.
   Thousands of onlookers lined the 8-mile-long route as Marcos
loyalists marched from Josefa Edralin-Marcos' suburban Manila home
to a highway bordering the capital. She died about 40 days ago.
   The motorcade then continued to the town of Agoo, 100 miles
north of Manila, where Mrs. Marcos' remains were to lie overnight
in a Roman Catholic church. The mayor of the town is a Marcos
supporter and thousands of people were gathered outside the church
to keep vigil.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4 at age 95, is to be buried
at a still undetermined date in her northern home province of
Ilocos Norte.
   The funeral cortege by supporters of the exiled former president
preceded the two-day, 270-mile motorcade, which is to make short
stops in seven towns along the way to Ilocos Norte. There, mourners
are again to march behind the body to the town of Sarrat, Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos' birthplace.
   During Wednesday's funeral procession, dozens of vehicles honked
their horns as marchers, some with red balloons, rhythmically blew
whistles and chanted slogans describing President Corazon Aquino as
``stupid and corrupt.''
   Mrs. Aquino, who is on a trip to Europe, cited security reasons
for refusing to allow Marcos to return from exile in Hawaii to
attend his mother's funeral.
   Marcos loyalists distributed leaflets to the marchers,
eulogizing Mrs. Edralin-Marcos as a ``great mother ... who served
as the light and teacher of her great son, Ferdinand Marcos.''
   They accused Mrs. Aquino of destroying Philippine tradition and
violating the Christian commandment to love one's parents by not
allowing Marcos to return for the funeral.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986, after the
civilian-backed military revolt that ended his 20-year rule and
swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   The body of Mrs. Edralin-Marcos has become the focus of a
bizarre drama in which Marcos' dwindling supporters are trying to
use his mother's remains to help their hero return home.
   The twice-embalmed body of the former schoolteacher had been
kept at a sanctuary in the Manila suburb of San Juan since she
died. Her two children in Manila, Pacifico Marcos and Fortuna
Marcos-Barba, have set no date for the funeral in hopes their
exiled brother would be allowed to attend the burial.
   To press the point, Marcos loylists have organized street
marches with up to 10,000 people, where speakers rail against the
government for denying Marcos the ``human right'' to bid farewell
to his mother.

<HEAD>Hong Kong No Longer Automatic Asylum For Vietnamese</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday said Vietnamese
boat people will no longer be offered automatic asylum in Hong Kong
and will be detained for repatriation if they fled their homeland
for economic reasons.
   The policy, which takes effect Thursday, was designed to end the
growing influx of Vietnamese refugees, thousands of whom have been
arriving in Hong Kong by boat since the end of the Vietnam War in
1975, officials said.
   ``Hong Kong is not the gateway for resettlement for people who
are leaving Vietnam for essentially economic reasons,'' Governor
Sir David Wilson told reporters.
   About 7,800 boat people have braved the treacherous waters from
Vietnam to Hong Kong this year, or 12 times the number who arrived
during the same period last year, according to government
statistics.
   Under the new policy, immigration officers will interview
arriving refugees to determine if they are fleeing persecution in
Vietnam. Those who do not qualify will be put in a prison-like
detention camp on an outlying island of this British colony,
pending their return to Vietnam.
   ``We feel most strongly that a stand must be taken here and now
against the continuing outflow of boat people from Vietnam, the
vast majority of whom have no claim to be treated as refugees in
the normal internationally accepted sense,'' Chief Secretary David
Ford said in announcing the new policy in the Legislative Council.
   If recent trends continue, less than 10 percent of arrivals
would qualify as refugees, officials said. But the new measure will
not apply to boat people already in Hong Kong, who will remain
eligible for resettlement whether they left home for economic or
political reasons.
   Government officials say Vietnam has shown little interest in
accepting returning boat people and an orderly repatriation plan
may have to wait until Western nations offer Hanoi additional
economic aid.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, portraying
himself as an effective crimefighter, said Wednesday misguided
Reagan administration action in fighting illegal drugs was ``one of
the reasons I'm running for the presidency.''
   The Massachusetts governor and probable Democratic presidential
nominee touted the declining Massachusetts crime rate.
   He also accused Reagan of hampering the war on drugs by cutting
Coast Guard funds. ``It energizes me on the presidential trail,''
Dukakis said of the reduced anti-drug patrols.
   ``How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs
when we're cutting Coast Guard patrols by 55 percent,'' he told
reporters outside the state police academy. ``It's that kind of
thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the presidency.''
   In Washington, Republican George Bush, Dukakis' likely opponent
in the fall, blamed congressional Democrats for the Coast Guard
budget cut, and he accused Democratic presidential candidates of
making a ``shrill political issue'' of anti-drug programs.
   ``I'm sick and tired ... in hearing the Democrats do nothing but
tear down and criticize'' Reagan administration anti-drug efforts,
Bush said. ``I'm talking about Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis
the last two months.''
   While Dukakis was in Massachusetts, his close friend and
campaign chairman Paul Brountas continued meetings in Washington
with party leaders and prospective Dukakis running mates. Sens.
John Glenn of Ohio, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Llyod Bentsen of
Texas and Sam Nunn of Georgia as well as House Majority Leader
Thomas Foley of Washington were among those expected to meet with
Brountas before he returned home late Thursday or Friday, campaign
and Capitol Hill aides said. Brountas also met with Jackson on
Wednesday.
   Dukakis, who was to begin a Southern campaign swing Thursday
during which he will continue to focus on crime, was at the police
academy to meet with his anti-crime council and salute the state's
Violent Fugitive Arrest Squad, which has made more than 700 arrests
in its two and one-half years of existence.
   ``Eternal vigilance is what's needed,'' Dukakis said.
   Asked if he felt Bush would be able to portray him as being soft
on crime, Dukakis cited his state's crime rate, which has dropped
14 percent in the past four years.
   Then, lumping Bush with Reagan, he added: ``They've got lots of
answering to do for what's been happening over the past eight
years.''
   The governor broke into a broad smile when asked what he thought
of Bush's comment that he was a ``Brookline, Mass., liberal,'' a
reference to Dukakis' hometown.
   ``If you come from Milton ...,'' Dukakis said before breaking
off in mid-sentence. Milton, in the same county as Brookline, is
Bush's birthplace.
   On other matters, Dukakis:
   _ Supported in general the recommendations of a presidential
commisson on AIDS and said as president he would personally lobby
for an anti-discrimination law called for by the panel to protect
victims of the disease.
   _ Said he had made no decision whether to support a $40 million
cigarette tax being considered to help the state erase a projected
budget shortfall for next year.
   Wednesday was the third straight day Dukakis was on the road
discussing crime and drugs. On Monday he visited a Somerville,
Mass., playground to pomote drug education, following that up a day
later with a visit to the New Bedford waterfront and an idle Coast
Guard cutter. He stopped in front of a large mounted gun on deck as
photographers scrambled for shots.

   An East German soldier shot another
guard in the foot Wednesday, plunged into the nearby Elbe River and
swam to safety in West Germany, police in Hanover said.
   West German border police said the escape took place as the
soldier and a sergeant were on guard duty about 30 miles southeast
of Hamburg, where the river forms the border between the two German
states.
   In remote areas along the communist line of fences and barriers
separating East Germany from West Germany, East German border
guards work in pairs to discourage escapes.
   After shooting the sergeant in the foot to prevent him from
interfering with the escape, the 23-year-old East German soldier
dived into the river and swam 500 feet to safety in a West German
border patrol boat, police said.
   Police said the East German soldier cited dissatisfaction with
conditions in his homeland as his reason for fleeing.
   No other details surrounding the escape were released.

<TEXT>
   A judge suspended for misconduct is 35 days
into a fast to protest what he contends is discrimination against
him because he is Hispanic, bisexual and critical of the judicial
system.
   Ramsey County District Judge Alberto Miera has vowed not to eat
for 100 days, which nutrition experts say would mean certain death.
However, some have questioned whether the St. Paul judge is really
sticking to his fast.
   ``Obviously I'm weak physically. That has to be expected,''
Miera said Wednesday. ``But emotionally and spiritually and in
terms of internal strength, I feel very strong.''
   Miera, 37, was suspended with pay in March by the Minnesota
Supreme Court, which is considering a recommendation by the state
Board on Judicial Standards to remove him from the bench.
   The board recommended in February that the Supreme Court remove
Miera for forcibly kissing his male court reporter, for making
improper remarks and gestures to female court employees, for
referring to other judges as ``bloodthirsty hypocrites,'' and for
other alleged misconduct.
   Miera's case has divided the Twin Cities' Hispanic community.
   ``There are people in the community that don't agree with what's
going on and there are those in the community that feel Alberto has
brought it upon himself,'' said Martin Diaz, chief legal officer
for Centro Legal, a Hispanic-oriented legal aid organization with
offices in Minneapolis and on St. Paul's West Side, which has a
large Hispanic population.
   The Minnesota Minority Lawyers Association has called for an
investigation, saying Minnesota judges face a ``hostile
environment.''
   Miera said he began a 40-day partial fast on April 1, eating one
meal every other day supplemented with nutritional liquids. On May
11 he began drinking only water with lemon and taking vitamins, he
said.
   But a nutrition expert last month questioned whether Miera was
sticking to his fast.
   Dr. Ancel Keys, an expert on human starvation, said when the
judge appeared for a Supreme Court hearing May 24 he looked better
than a person at that stage of the fast would look.
   ``If he lasts 100 days, we'll know he's cheating, but I think
he's cheating anyway,'' Keys, director and professor emeritus of
the University of Minnesota's epidemiology department, told the St.
Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch.
   Miera, who would not discuss his weight loss, maintains he has
stuck to his fast and has invited reporters to observe him at home.
   ``Granted, I tried something extreme,'' Miera said. ``If that's
what I need to demonstrate the sincerity of what I said, the
commitment I need and the dedication I have, then that's what I
have to do.''
   Some legislators have called for Miera to end his fast and for
an investigation of alleged bias in the judicial system. Gov. Rudy
Perpich, who appointed Miera to the bench in 1983, met with him
last weekend to urge him to end his fast, but the judge would not
relent.
   Archbishop John R. Roach of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and
Minneapolis prayed with Miera at the judge's home Wednesday, Miera
said. An archdiocese spokeswoman confirmed the meeting but released
no details.
   Neil K. Johnson, the former court reporter who won a civil jury
verdict against Miera last year but declined comment for months
after the trial, broke his silence this week. On Wednesday he
called Miera's fast manipulative.
   ``This whole story breaks down to a guy who's so outrageous and
just happens to be Mexican,'' Johnson said. ``Nobody comes to help
me because I'm white.''
   In March 1987, a jury found that Miera committed battery under
civil law by forcibly kissing Johnson in December 1984. The jury
awarded Johnson $375,000 in damages, but District Judge John
Weyrens of Litchfield reduced the amount to $125,000. The jury's
decision and the judge's award reduction were upheld by the
Minnesota Court of Appeals on June 7.
   Miera said he fired Johnson for poor work habits and attitudes.
Johnson contends he was fired because he refused the judge's sexual
advances.
   Johnson accused Miera of trying to manipulate public sympathy.
   ``He's getting national press and he knew he would,'' Johnson
said. ``I'm defending myself for having won.''
   Miera said he'll end his fast only if Johnson recants or if
other Ramsey County judges acknowledge that they did not have a
right to publicly comment while Miera's case was pending. He does
not expect either to happen.

   One person was missing and nine were rescued
Wednesday after a Canadian coastal vessel and a Great Lakes
freighter collided in the St. Lawrence River 100 miles north of
Quebec City, Canada's coast guard said.
   Coast Guard controller Paul Kendrick said the smaller vessel,
the Coudres-de-l'Ile, loaded with scrap iron, sank after colliding
in heavy fog with the 726-foot Algo West.
   ``We can't see anything but wreckage,'' said Hubert Desgagnes of
coast guard search and rescue.
   Ten men were aboard the Coudres-de-l'Ile and nine were picked up
by the Algo West. All were wearing life jackets.
   Two coast guard cutters and two merchant ships joined the search
for the missing sailor.
   The Algo West was carrying grain.

   A Cape Town weekly banned in
May by the home affairs minister was back in circulation Wednesday,
although its publishers said they fear it could be outlawed again
at any time.
   South, one of two papers banned by minister Stoffel Botha
because he objected to their content, went on sale with a
front-page story headlined ``Crackdown.'' The paper reported on
anti-government activists who have been detained or restricted
since the state of emergency was renewed last Friday.
   South was banned on May 9 for one month. Under the new emergency
laws, Botha can extend the ban two additional months but thus far
has not exercised that power.
   New Nation, a weekly published by the South African Catholic
Bishops Conference and aimed at a black audience, says it intends
to put out an expanded issue when it reappears June 30 following a
three-month ban.
   Botha can still ban New Nation along with South and at least
five other publications to which he has issued warnings.
   Both pro- and anti-government newspapers have complained about
the new emergency regulations, which have extended restrictions on
who can be quoted and what they can be quoted as saying. Newspapers
now are also prohibited from indicating how their reports have been
censored to comply with the regulations.
   The emergency regulations prohibit reporting about calls for
boycotts or illegal strikes and ban information about their success
or any measures used to ensure they occur.

   Jacques d'Amboise brought the sights and sounds
of Coney Island alive on stage at the Felt Forum, with scores of
dancers playing waves, crabs, sand fleas and a family at the beach.
   A thousand school children were joined by professional dancers,
senior citizens, New York City police officers and Australian
lifeguards for ``A Day in the Life of Coney Island.''
   Tuesday's show was the National Dance Institute's annual ``Event
of the Year.''
   d'Amboise, who founded the institute in 1976 to teach dancing to
schoolboys, wrote this year's story. He also wrote most of the
lyrics and conductor Lee Norris wrote most of the tunes used for
the dances.
   The event, once limited to boys, featured male and female
dancers, ages 3 to 85.

   The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders
urged the Reagan administration on Wednesday to appoint a special
envoy to pursue U.S. interests in Afghanistan as the withdrawal of
Soviet troops is completed.
   Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said naming an ambassador-at-large for Afghanistan
for a six-month period would ``send a needed signal to the
(anti-communist) resistance, the Soviets and to other regional
states that the United States intends to remain responsibly
involved in the affairs of the subcontinent.''
   In a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the two
senators said the envoy also would ``provide a focal point for
monitoring resistance activities and coordinating U.S. policies and
programs with the resistance.''
   ``Now that we are seeing the beginning of what we hope will be
the total withdrawal of Soviet forces, and the restoration of a
free and independent Afghanistan, we believe it is imperative for
the United States to manifest continued support and implement
effective coordination with the resistance,'' the Byrd-Dole letter
said.

   Iraq said its warplanes flew hundreds of
sorties Wednesday and Iran claimed to have shot one down.
   Iraq said its fighter jets and helicopter gunships flew 332
sorties, 60 more than Tuesday. The official Iraqi News Agency,
monitored in Nicosia, said 83 fighter jets and 249 helicopter
gunships were involved.
   Heavy use of gunships usually indicates major ground battles.
Iraq's strategy in the war that began in September 1980 has been to
use its air superiority to counter Iran's greater strength on the
ground.
   A television report in Tehran said Iranian fighters shot down an
Iraqi Mirage fighter jet over the Persian Gulf, but Iraq denied any
losses.
   Iran reported several other air encounters. Iraq said its
soldiers won skirmishes in the northern and central sectors of the
730-mile border war front, but Iranian reports did not mention
fighting on the ground.
   Conflicting reports cannot be reconciled because neither side
allows independent observers near battle zones except on rare
guided tours.
   The current battles started Monday with an Iranian assault on
Iraqi positions east of Basra, the Iraqi port and southern
provincial capital.
   In the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy completed its 36th convoy of
the year on Wednesday as the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Surf City
sailed out through the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway's southern
entrance.
   Maj. Charles Boyd, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said
the trip was uneventful. It started in Kuwait on Sunday.
   The 81,283-ton Surf City is one of the 11 Kuwait-owned tankers
re-registered by the United States a year ago to entitle them to
U.S. naval protection in the war-torn gulf.
   The 3,600-ton missile frigate Robert G. Bradley, one of several
recently arrived warships, escorted the Surf City.
   Since July of 1987, the Navy has conducted 58 convoys through
the gulf, most involving at least one Kuwaiti tanker.

Research</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision to suspend a federally funded
program to develop an artificial heart is being challenged by a
group of senators whose states stand to lose millions of dollars in
research grants.
   The senators said in a draft of a letter Wednesday that they
will seek to insert language into an appropriations bill to compel
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to continue the four
contracts under the program.
   The contracts were worth more than $20 million under a 69-month
program to develop a permanent, fully implanted artificial heart.
The program began in January.
   But last month, the institute, part of the National Institutes
of Health, announced it was suspending the program as of Sept. 30
and shifting its focus instead to developing a left ventricular
assist device, which would help a diseased heart pump blood.
   So far, all five patients with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart
have died within two years. The Jarvik-7 runs on compressed air.
The program suspended by Claude Lenfant, director of NHLBI, was for
development of an electric, self-contained heart.
   The centers that would lose research grants under the decision
are the Hershey Medical Center of Pennsylvania State University;
the University of Utah in Salt Lake City; Abiomed Inc. of Danvers,
Mass., which is working with the Texas Heart Institute of Houston;
and the Nimbus Co. of Rancho Cordova, Calif., which is working with
the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
   The plans to seek a legislative remedy were unveiled in a draft
of a letter being prepared Wednesday by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The letter asks the Senate appropriations subcommittee which
oversees NIH's budget ``to include language in the appropriations
bill to direct the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to fund
existing commitments, such as the total artificial heart, prior to
undertaking new obligations.''
   The letter said the artificial heart program ``provides hope to
millions of Americans with cardiovascular disease and is part of
our ongoing commitment to maintain this country's leadership in
biotechnology.''
   While the letter was still being fine-tuned, Senate staff
members said they did not expect any change in its recommendation
that language be included in the NIH spending bill supporting
artificial heart research.
   The decision to appeal to the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and
Human Services came out of a meeting in Hatch's office last week
with Lenfant. Participating were Hatch and Sens. John Heinz, R-Pa.;
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; and Robert Stafford, R-Vt.
   Heinz said in an interview after the meeting that he would
support legislative language to reverse the contract suspensions,
which he said would cost Penn State University some $5 million in
research money. All the centers received $700,000 in January as the
first installment in the program.
   Calls to the appropriations subcommittee were referred to staff
member Michael J. Hall, who said he had not yet seen the letter and
could not comment.
   Lenfant has said the government might resume its research for a
total artificial heart if work was successful in the assist device.

   Voice of America officials said Wednesday that
Soviet authorities have agreed informally to let the government
radio service open a bureau in Moscow.
   The U.S. Information Agency, which runs VOA, applied to Soviet
authorities a year ago for permission to open a Moscow bureau. USIA
Director Charles Z. Wick renewed the request in informal talks with
Soviet officials at the recent summit in Moscow.
   ``Soviet authorities have indicated informally that they will
soon respond positively to VOA's request to open a Moscow bureau,''
said Beth Knisley, a spokeswoman for the radio service.
   The bureau would be VOA's first in Moscow and the service hopes
to have it set up and ready for broadcasting in three months, she
said.
   Wick could not be reached for comment. USIA spokesman Joseph
O'Connel said the agency would ``make an announcement at the
appropriate time.''
   The Soviets, under the glasnost _ or openness _ policies of
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, have recently opened more doors to VOA,
allowing interviews with officials.
   The Soviets stopped jamming VOA broadcasts to the Soviet Union
on May 26, 1987, and stopped interferring with broadcasts to Poland
on Jan. 1 of this year. They currently are jamming just two of
VOA's broadcasts, both to Afghanistan in the languages of Dari and
Pashto, Knisley said.
   VOA has 25 bureaus worldwide, broadcasting in numerous languages.
   Although they have stopped jamming VOA broadcasts, the Soviets
still try to interfere with reception of Radio Liberty and Radio
Free Europe, both also operated by the U.S. government.

   Drought has punched hard at much of the nation
and threatens to shrivel this year's corn crop if rains don't come
soon, Vice President George Bush said Wednesday after a briefing at
the Agriculture Department.
   Bush and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole met about half an hour
with Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng to hear the latest
information on the widespread drought that has gripped many of the
nation's most productive agricultural areas.
   ``The nation's corn crop is now entering a very crucial growing
period,'' Bush said in a statement. ``While it is too early to
fully assess any damage from the drought, without rain there is the
potential for this to be a catastrophe.''
   Bush said the administration ``is working closely with the
members of the Senate and the House, and we hope to do whatever we
can to minimize the effect'' of the drought on U.S. agriculture.
   Farmers in more than 800 counties in 21 states are receiving
some form of emergency relief, he said.
   ``But sad to say, nothing will take place of rainfall, and we
have to be concerned about the plight of the nation's farmers,''
Bush said.
   Bush and Dole left the USDA meeting without responding to
reporters' questions.
   However, Norton Strommen, the department's chief meteorologist,
went over material he said was presented to Bush and Dole,
including red-and-yellow charts showing the advent of drought
conditions.
   Strommen said the West was severely lacking in moisture from
reduced snowpack during the winter, which resulted in
``well-below-normal'' reservoir levels in much of the region,
including Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Nevada.
   Another major problem area to develop was in the northern Great
Plains, notably in Montana and the Dakotas, he said. And dry areas
still persist in the Southeast, which has not yet fully recovered
from the 1986 drought.
   ``The best areas in terms of moisture are the Southwest, up into
the central Great Plains ... in Kansas and Nebraska,'' Strommen
said.
   Just in the last two weeks, the drought has expanded into the
eastern Corn Belt states of the Midwest, and ``this is a major
concern for us,'' he said.
   Without substantial rains soon, Strommen said the Corn Belt
drought has a ``potential for deterioration'' of crops.
   ``It simply is too early in the growing season to try and define
what that potential is,'' he said.
   Corn planted this spring will need enough moisture to get it
through its critical pollination stage of development in mid-July,
while soybeans are later and run into critical moisture needs in
July and August, he said.

   Actor Jimmy Stewart urged Congress on
Wednesday to preserve ``the creative vision'' of the directors of
classic films by preventing their work from being ``colorized'' or
otherwise altered by computer techniques.
   ``I have been in the motion picture business quite a while now,
almost 60 years, and I have great respect for the motion picture,''
Stewart said. ``I think it's something of tremendous value and I
want to do everything I can to preserve it.''
   Stewart, 80, spoke with reporters on the eve of a congressional
committee's vote on the National Film Preservation Act of 1988. The
measure seeks to settle the dispute over the artistic rights of
directors who object to color being added to black and white films,
or to editing or other changes made to their films by distributors
or exhibitors.
   ``There've been all sorts of things happening lately that take
the motion picture as a means to make more money and in doing so
destroy the original picture itself,'' Stewart said.
   Stewart read a letter of support from Frank Capra, who directed
him in ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' Through a clerical error, the
film fell into the public domain, was bought, colorized and
copyrighted by the new owners.
   ``This monstrosity is an embarrassment to me and my friend James
Stewrt,'' Capra said. ``They splashed it all over with Easter egg
colors and they ruined it.''
   Lamenting the alteration of what Capra described as a film
originally ``intended to prove the worth of every person,'' the
letter said, ``even the villian looks pink and cheerful. The story,
therefore, has been changed.''
   Earlier this year, Stewart and a number of Hollywood directors
voiced their opposition at Senate hearing investigating the
dispute, which became more heated after Atlanta businessman Ted
Turner bought the rights to and colorized classic films such as
``Casablanca,'' ``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' and ``It's a Wonderful
Life.''
   The film preservation act, sponsored by Rep. Robert J. Mrazek,
D-N.Y., creates a National Film Commission to determine which films
are ``culturally, historically or esthetically significant'' to be
placed in a newly created National Film Registry.
   Once designated, these films, if altered, would have to include
a disclaimer indicating that ``this version is not the original
creative vision'' of the director, actor or screenwriter, he said.
   ``Our National Film Commission simply has the responsibility to
determine whether, in fact, certain films are works of art and
deserving of some protection by U.S. government because they are an
enduring part of our national cultural heritage,'' Mrazek said. The
bill seeks $500,000 to create the commission.
   He said the bill also affords full copyright protection to the
creators of designated films and makes it unlawful to colorize or
materially alter these works without changing the titles.
   ``This is the best compromise we could come up with. I think we
have a consensus,'' Mrazek said.
   Asked if his old friend Ronald Reagan agreed with his position,
Stewart mentioned a brief meeting during which the president ``was
very positive in his statement that he was with us all the way.''

   Postal officials have found a way to cut _ but
not eliminate _ their loss in hauling building materials for an
Alaska shipper.
   An Anchorage building-materials supplier is mailing more than
10,000 concrete blocks and bags of cement about 700 miles to a
remote village, postal officials confirmed Wednesday.
   Each block and bag of cement must be individually addressed to
get within the 70-pound weight limit on parcels.
   ``It will cost us about $180,000 to transport all that stuff,''
spokeswoman Meg Harris said. The postage is expected to bring in
only about $45,000, meaning a loss of about $135,000 for the post
office.
   But that's still considerably better than the loss of $500,000
originally reported for the shipment.
   The postal service is faced with transporting the material for
less than its actual costs because postage rates are universal _
meaning they are the same across the country.
   Thus, the price charged for sending mail is based on the average
cost of delivering it. If the postal service only has to take a
parcel from Cleveland to Dayton, it comes out ahead on the deal.
   If it has to carry concrete blocks 700 miles across the tundra,
or cartons of eggs down into the Grand Canyon, costs exceed the
postage.
   The idea of universal rates, explained Ms. Harris, is that
people do not have to suffer because they reside in rural areas.
   When confronted by an unusual case, however, such as the Alaskan
contractor, the Postal Service's only recourse is to try and find a
way to handle the material for less.
   The original, higher cost estimate for the massive shipment was
projected under a special ``bypass'' mail system used in Alaska,
where groceries and other large, heavy items often are mailed to
rural areas. The bypass system lets mailers bring their items
directly to the airlines, bypassing the post office.
   Ms. Harris said officials have ``decided to bypass the bypass
system,'' at least in the case of the shipment of concrete blocks
and cement.
   Instead, the shipment will be trucked to a mail center at Dead
Horse, Alaska, and flown from there, reducing the agency's overall
costs.
   The shipment, 6,000 blocks and 4,600 bags of cement, is being
sent by Bush Consolidators in Anchorage to the village of
Wainright, about 90 miles from Barrow.

<HEAD>Low Water Hampers Traffic Along Mississippi River</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 750 barges were stranded Wednesday
on the Mississippi River because of low water, and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers said that twice as many could be stranded by the
weekend.
   The low water has forced barges to operate only during daylight
hours and to lighten their loads, said Jeffrey Smith, vice
president of the American Waterways Operators in Arlington, Va.
   ``Low water _ since the days of Mark Twain _ has been an
occupational hazard, and they know how to deal with it. Things are
somewhat restricted, but cargo is still moving,'' Smith said
Wednesday.
   Mississippi River barges carry such cargo as grain, petroleum,
chemicals, iron and steel, he said.
   The barges began backing up after one ran aground Monday and
large barges decided to wait for a dredge to arrive Thursday to
deepen the channel.
   The river is only 9 feet deep near Vaucluse Landing, Ark., about
3 miles north of the Greenville, Miss. bridge.
   ``They are skittish about using it because one mess-up costs
lots of dollars,'' said Michael Logue, spokesman for the corps'
Vicksburg District.
   Ron Goldman, the district's chief of water control management,
said the Mississippi is at its lowest point for this time of year
since records were first kept in 1872.
   The Vicksburg gauge read 2.5 feet on Tuesday, he said. The
lowest level on record is minus 7 feet in February 1940, when much
of the upper river froze. Without significant rainfall, the river
will fall below zero on the Vicksburg gauge within two weeks,
Goldman said, with zero on the gauge representing 46.2 feet above
mean sea level.
   Louis Logue, the district's chief of river operations, said the
river is expected to keep falling and other problem sites could
develop.
   ``I'm talking seriously with the Lord about this now,'' he said.
``Up until now I've just been talking regularly.''
   Logue said barges and tows generally require 9 to 10 feet of
water. Each barge carries an average cargo of 1,000 tons.
   Bob Gardner, vice president of ContiCarriers in Chicago, said
the low water was also creating bottlenecks near Memphis and Cairo,
Ill.
   ``The low water is definitely causing us some disruptions on the
lower Mississippi,'' said Gardner, a former Mississippi River
captain.
   He said his company has reduced the number of barges to a
maximum of 20 per tow and some lines are running only in daylight
hours.

   Journalist Carl T. Rowan writes in his
syndicated column for Thursday that as long as society is ``awash
in guns and drugs,'' he feels justified in using a gun to protect
his home and family.
   The column, distributed to 100 newspapers by North America
Syndicate, a part of the King Features Group, recounts events
surrounding Rowan's shooting of a teen-age intruder outside his
door before dawn Tuesday.
   ``Yes, I've given the headline writers and the pro-gun zealots a
field day,'' said Rowan, who has written frequently on the need for
gun control.
   ``The irresponsible headlines and provocative labels do not
bother me, because I know that today's newspapers could be carrying
something worse: my obituary,'' he wrote.
   ``I am appalled that so many people are so eager to spread their
propaganda about gun laws that they ignore the first overriding
fact: that my home was violated, my family was threatened by
strangers who came in the darkness.''
   Rowan said he was awakened at 1:55 a.m. by the sound of someone
at his bedroom window and the sight of four people at his backyard
swimming pool. After calling the police, he armed himself with a
handgun he said his son, a former FBI agent, gave him during a time
when he was receiving death threats.
   He said he shot Ben Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., in the wrist
near his doorway after Smith lunged at him, despite being warned to
stop and being told Rowan had a gun. The youth was treated at a
hospital for the injury and released.
   The National Rifle Association called Rowan hypocritical for
being against guns, but owning one himself.
   Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, a strong supporter of the right to
bear arms, bought Rowan a membership in the NRA and sent him a
telegram Wednesday reading:
   ``Notwithstanding your past columns to the contrary, you
demonstrated by your recent actions that you agree with my position
concerning every American's right to bear arms.
   ``In America, freedom and justice have always come from three
sources _ the ballot box, the jury box and when those fail, the
cartridge box.''
   The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms made
light of the incident by announcing that it would award the
columnist the 1988 ``Pool Shooters Award for defending his pool
from those who would prey on people pools.''
   The group also took the opportunity to condemn the capital's
strict gun law, which forbids private citizens from having handguns
unless they owned and registered them before 1976.
   Police said Rowan's gun was not registered with the city. The
columnist said his son, who bought it while he was with the FBI,
told him city authorities had said it did not need to be.
   The weapons was confiscated by police and the U.S. attorney's
office is investigating the incident.
   Headlines and labels such as ``Rowan Shoots Teen-age Intruder,''
``Columnist Shoots Teen Skinny-Dipper,'' ``Rambo Rowan'' and ``The
Jacuzzi Gunman'' have been applied to the accounts of Rowan's
encounter with Smith.
   But Rowan said, ``When someone has scaled an 8-foot-high fence
and is testing a way to enter my house, I assume he is not coming
to get my autograph.''
   The columnist said that when he confronted Smith, the youth was
smoking something he suspected was marijuana.
   ``Let the National Rifle Association or others call me a
hypocrite because I fired a gun in a moment of personal peril. I
shall still be for strict gun control,'' Rowan wrote.
   ``But as long as police and prosecutors tell people that they
can scale my fence in the darkness, bring their drugs and beer,
party around my pool, rattle my bedroom windows, all with impunity,
I'll never know which druggie also has brought a gun.''
   ``A lot of theoretical, ideological crap is being written by
people who have not been threatened, have not had a stranger at
their bedroom window at 2 a.m. and have not been confronted by a
doped-up intruder just outside their door.
   ``Let my political enemies crow. But let them know that as long
as authorities leave this society awash in drugs and guns I will
protect my family.''
   Police did not charge Smith with any drug offense. He and a
young woman companion were accused of unlawful entry initially, but
prosecutors dropped those charges late Tuesday.

   President Reagan suggested Wednesday that
``everyone would feel that it was more proper'' if House Speaker
Jim Wright were investigated by an independent counsel instead of
the House ethics committee.
   The committee is looking into allegations by Rep. Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., and others that Wright, D-Texas, has violated House ethics
rules by misusing his office for personal gain and improperly
intervening with federal regulators.
   Some Republicans, including Vice President George Bush, have
suggested that it would be better to have the investigation
conducted by an independent counsel.
   Reagan, asked whether he agreed, said: ``I have to wonder if it
should not be an independent counsel from the standpoint of the
relationship of the speaker to the majority of the committee. And I
think everyone would feel that it was more proper if it was done by
an investigator outside _ an appointed investigator.''
   Although Reagan spoke of the majority of the committee, the
panel is actually evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats,
with six members from each party. The chairman of the committee is
Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif.
   Wright, who has declared his innocence, was not immediately
available for comment. His spokeswoman, Charmayne Marsh, repeated
his statement that he had no objection to use of an outside counsel
if the committee decided to hire one.
   ``We've said all along, it's up to the committee,'' she said.
``We want them to get every piece of information they possibly want
and settle it as quickly as possible.''
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., a staunch defender of
the speaker, said, ``I think it is further indication of the
politicization of this matter, which is most unfortunate.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president was
``not talking any specifics'' in terms of what kind of independent
investigation should be undertaken, but was ``just saying he thinks
an independent investigation is appropriate.''
   Fitzwater said he believed the only legal possibility would be
an independent investigator appointed by the committee. He said
there was no legal authority for an investigation of the speaker by
an independent counsel of the kind set up by law to look into
allegations of wrongdoing by officers of the executive branch. The
Justice Department has challenged the constitutionality of that law.
   On the substance of Gingrich's charges, the president said: ``I
think it is proper that there is an investigation going forward
with regard to these charges, but I don't think that anyone should
give an opinion until we know whether they are just accusations or
whether they really have happened.''
   Reagan made the remarks during an interview with seven reporters
from the seven countries that will participate in the economic
summit June 19-21 in Toronto.
   Wright is accused of six possible violations of House rules but
has denied any wrongdoing.
   The accusations include improper lobbying on behalf of oil
companies with which Wright may have had financial relationships;
circumstances surrounding publication of a book for which he
received a higher-than-usual royalty and which was produced with
the help of a congressionally paid staffer; contacts with federal
officials on behalf of Texas savings and loans; and use of a
condominium in Fort Worth for which he paid no monthly rent.

<HEAD>92-Year-Old Back to Work After Finding Fourth Retirement
Unsatisfying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAK LAWN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old habits die hard, which may explain why
Clarence Walker occupies a stool at Western Tool and Die Works each
morning when nearly all his contemporaries are deep in easy chairs.
   Retirement, says the 92-year-old, was no more satisfying the
fourth time than the first.
   ``The reason I'm back at work is because I want to live a while
longer,'' Walker said during a telephone interview Wednesday.
``Without work, I was laying around, just kind of dying.
   ``My mind was going blank and I didn't know what to do with
myself,'' he added. ``I didn't need the money so much as something
to do.''
   Walker's last job lasted more than a decade and his fourth try
at full-time leisure for three years after that, most of it spent
watching television and enjoying the company of his gray cat,
Smokey.
   Feeling he was getting stale, Walker bought a new pickup truck,
renewed his habit of ``wandering'' on weekends, then enrolled in
Operation ABLE, a county-funded job program to help people 55 and
older find work.
   He landed at Western Tool and Die, a subsidiary of Chicago-based
Eastco Corp., which draws as much as 30 percent of its workforce
from the 65-and-over crowd.
   ``He's happy to be working and we're just as happy to have
him,'' said Eastco President George Patrick Pollack. ``Talking to
him or looking at him ... or listening to him trade barbs with the
guys on the (assembly) line, you'd never guess his age.
   ``It's only when he walks that you can see him slowing down,''
added Pollack.
   Walker has rheumatoid arthritis in both knees and needs two
canes. But thanks to the pickup, he still spends most weekends
criss-crossing Wisconsin, where he owns five acres of land, and
Michigan.
   ``I got lost Sunday on the way back from Michigan, but I just
figured that kind of thing is the spice of life,'' he said. ``I've
always had a yearning to see what's on the other side of the hill.''
   That yearning prompted Walker to join the Army _ he was a chief
cook in Winchester, England, during World War I _ and several years
later to quit a job as a bakery truck driver and rode the rails out
West for a year and a half.
   ``It was,'' he says, ``the best time of my life.''
   Walker returned to Wisconsin and began working steadily again,
and married in 1923. He and his wife of 52 years, Anna, had five
children. She died in 1975.
   Walker first retired at 65, from Modern Machinery in Cudahy,
Wis. He was back a year later, but left two years after that
because he hit the mandatory retirement age of 68.
   He drove a school bus outside Milwaukee the next four years, but
``at 72, they told me I was too old; they couldn't get insurance.''
   So after gardening at his Wisconsin home, he moved to Illinois
in the early 1970s, went to work for Chicago Cylinder for more than
10 years, then made another try at retirement before landing his
current job.
   Walker concedes that inspecting 6-inch electrical wires for
defects six hours a day, five days a week is boring work. But he's
done assembly-line work before, the pay _ $7 an hour _ isn't bad,
and it beats sitting around the house.
   ``When you're 65 retirement isn't too bad because you have some
friends around and your family,'' said Walker. ``When you're 90,
you don't have any friends left and your kids have got their own
lives to lead so you don't want to be with them all the time either.
   ``That's why this working business is so nice. I never could sit
still.''

   Jesse Jackson said he held a ``meaningful
preliminary discussion'' on Wednesday with the Michael Dukakis'
campaign aide interviewing potential running mates, but said he has
not decided if he wants the spot.
   Following a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, in
which members urged him to seek the post, Jackson revealed he had
talked to Dukakis' campaign chairman Paul Brountas earlier in the
day about the matter.
   ``It was a very meaningful preliminary discussion,'' he told a
news conference.
   Later in an interview on Cable News Network, Jackson elaborated
briefly, saying, ``We simply discussed today the process, discussed
the guidelines, we talked about the requirements. After all, we
need to know what the rules are, what the standarsds will be.''
   Jackson also made clear he wants to discuss a range of issues,
in addition to the vice presidency, with the Dukakis camp. He said
he is prepared to go to the convention floor if Dukakis balks on
Jackson's key budget items of increasing taxes on the wealthy and
corporations and a military spending freeze.
   ``Of course, that's the proper mechanism and it's the thing to
do,'' he told CNN when asked if he would wage a floor fight over
those issues.
   Dukakis, who already has the delegate strength to win the
Democratic presidential nomination at the party's convention in
July, has designated Brountas to prospect for running mate
possibilities.
   Dukakis has previously said that Jackson will be considered, but
not that he will get any special consideration by virtue of his
runner-up status.
   Jackson made clear he would like the offer to be made to him
although he has declined to say that in so many words publicly,
instead stating that it is Dukakis' option.
   Black Caucus Chairman Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., said there was a
consensus among the caucus members that ``we ought to urge Reverand
Jackson to seek the seocnd spot on the ticket.''
   He said Jackson reacted privately with the congressmen as he
does publicly on the issue and did not go further in disclosing
whether he would accept it if offered.
   ``I've not yet made that decision,`` Jackson told reporters. ``I
have stated very clearly I`ve earned the right of serious
consideration.''
   Despite all the talk of the vice presidency, Jackson has not
officially conceded the presidential nomination to Dukakis. He said
earlier Wednesday that he has no intention of throwing the governor
his support before the convention, and said of his former
Democratic rivals who are lining up behind Dukakis: ``They lost and
surrendered. I did not. We're not in the same category.''
   The Black Caucus members said they want to meet with Dukakis and
lobby him to put Jackson on the ticket as his running mate.
   ``We come in with a candidate ... It seems to me that Governor
Dukakis has to come up with a better candidate, or at least be
prepared to share with us why he does not believe that Reverand
Jackson is the best candidate,'' if he does not choose Jackson,
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. He added ``nobody in this room''
can think of a better choice than Jackson.
   ``We want Governor Dukakis to say ... why he believes that
Reverand Jackson is a liability for the ticket,'' if in fact that
is the governor's decision, he said.
   One caucus member, Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., said he would not
support the Democratic ticket if Jackson was not on it and he felt
there was racism in keeping him off.
   But Dymally said Savage was the only one to voice that opinion,
and others said they would be faithful to the Demcratic ticket
regardless.
   Jackson, during a two-day swing through Washington, also said
Wednesday that his ``most critical'' political concern now is for
the Democratic convention to accept his budget priorities.
   Jackson's proposals include increased taxes on the wealthy and
corporations, and a military budget freeze to pay for social
programs.
   ``The most critical becomes this budget, a commitment to invest
in people, a commitment to reinvest in America,'' Jackson said
following a meeting with leaders of civil rights groups.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and top legislative
leaders announced an agreement Wednesday to close the state's
current $400 million budget gap, skirting a sensitive presidential
campaign issue by avoiding new taxes.
   Dukakis and the lawmakers failed to resolve the spending and tax
questions for the fast-approaching new fiscal year, however.
   Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee,
has been resisting calls from rival Jesse Jackson to include a
plank in the party platform calling for higher taxes on the wealthy.
   And any plan to increase taxes in Dukakis' home state would
surely be made into a campaign issue by the Republicans.
   The solution to the immediate Massachusetts budget crunch worked
out by the Democrats mainly involves government bookkeeping, with
little impact on government programs and no new taxes or fees.
   For fiscal 1989, which begins July 1, Dukakis and the
legislative leaders agreed on a target spending level of about
$11.8 billion, or nearly $200 million less than the governor
originally proposed in January and about the same as approved by
the House in May.
   To meet that goal, the government will need new revenues,
officials acknowledged. There were indications that the extra funds
could come from higher corporate and personal taxes, as well as a
modest increase in some fees.
   ``We've not only solved this year's problem, but we've left
substantial fiscal flexibility for next year, even though the
governor expects to sign a balancd budget in the next few weeks,''
Finance Secretary Frank Keefe told reporters at a briefing after
the closed-door meeting in Dukakis' office.
   With the Senate about to begin debate on a spending plan for the
new year, Democrats are struggling to find ways to deal with a
revenue forecast that has dropped by more than $200 million since
April.
   The tax proposals under discussion for next year include a $40
million sales tax on cigarettes, a $70 million increase in
corporate taxes by closing ``loopholes'' and a similar amount
through realigning the state and federal income tax codes.

<HEAD>Drug Probe at Nuclear Weapons Lab Prematurely Shut Down, House
Told</HEAD>

   The Energy Department prematurely shut down an
undercover investigation of widespread drug trafficking at a
top-secret California nuclear weapons laboratory and tried to
prevent Congress from finding out, House investigators were told
Wednesday.
   At the time the drug investigation, code-named ``Operation
Snowstorm,'' was killed, agents were still pursuing leads on 127
employees at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near San
Francisco, who were suspected drug users or dealers, witnesses said.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the nine-month investigation was
abruptly halted in September 1986 because officials were fearful of
publicity about rampant drug trafficking at Livermore, where highly
classified research into President Reagan's Star Wars missile
defense system is conducted.
   ``It seems to me that this Operation Snowstorm should be called
`Operation Snow Job','' Wyden said. He said DOE officials ``seem to
think just saying no is enough. DOE is too afraid of the stigma of
drugs to do anything about it.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, declared:
``We have serious questions about the integrity of security at our
nation's most sensitive nuclear weapons and research facilities.''
   Dingell said that after DOE and Livermore officials shut down
the drug investigation, they ``attempted to conceal this fact from
the subcommittee by providing conflicting statements to the
subcommittee staff and by withholding key documents.''
   Energy Undersecretary Joseph F. Salgado said officials decided
to terminate the investigation ``because it had run for eight
months and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads.''
   He said Operation Snowstorm had served its purpose in putting
Livermore employees on notice that drug use would not be tolerated.
Salgado denied that the Energy Department had attempted a cover-up.
   In a report circulated in advance of the hearing, Dingell said
Operation Snowstorm began in January 1986 because of ``an alarming
number of laboratory employees who were becoming involved in
drug-related incidents and arrests,'' including the sale of
computers and other government property for drug money.
   David A. Leary, who managed the undercover investigation,
testified that many of the drug pushers among Livermore's 8,500
employees held top-secret ``Q'' security clearances. He said the
illicit drugs they were selling included cocaine, marijuana,
methamphetamine and barbiturates.
   By contrast with Salgado's testimony, Leary said his
investigators were still pursuing 127 leads when the probe was
halted.
   Dingell quoted John Hunt, head of safeguards and security at
Livermore, as telling investigators that if Operation Snowstorm had
been allowed to continue, ``we would have to arrest 20 percent of
the lab.''
   Dingell also said that Leary and three other Livermore leaders
of Operation Snowstorm were effectively demoted when the
investigation was halted, and were barred from dealing further with
the laboratory's drug problems.
   ``When Leary resisted pressure to shut down Operation Snowstorm,
his career took a nose dive,'' Dingell said.
   Leary once supervised 200 employees as second in command of the
laboratory's safeguards and security department and as head of
Operation Snowstorm, Dingell said, but four months after the
investigation was terminated, Leary was working in Livermore's
laser program where he supervised no one.
   Salgado said the four were given ``diminished responsibilities.''
   Detective Robert Buda, who was recruited as an undercover agent
from the University of California police force for the
investigation, said he was ``very, very surprised'' at being able
to make his first drug purchase from a Livermore employee within
one week.
   Buda said this convinced him that drug traffickers regarded
classified areas of the laboratory as ``a complete sanctuary where
they were untouchable.''
   Within a few months, the panel was told, confidential informants
had fingered 35 suspected dealers or drug users at the laboratory,
many of whom held sensitive ``Q'' clearances.
   Buda said he was ``flabbergasted'' to learn that the
investigation was terminated three days before he received
clearance to pursue drug suspects in Livermore's classified ``green
badge'' area.
   ``We felt like the kid in front of the candy store,'' said John
C. Barber, the University of California police chief who served as
consultant to Operation Snowstorm.
   ``We had the money in our hands and we were ready to go inside
and do business,'' Barber said. ``But the investigation was shut
down before we reached the goal we'd set out to accomplish.''
   In May 1986, midway through the investigation, security agent
Timothy L. Mitchell said he told his superiors at Livermore that a
laboratory chemist had bought a 65-foot houseboat, was throwing
weekly champagne parties and was flashing wads of $100 bills.
   Mitchell said he told James Kahn, associate director at
Livermore, that the chemist's extravagant lifestyle, which he could
not afford on his salary, suggested he was involved either in drug
trafficking or espionage.
   According to Mitchell, Kahn replied: ``What's the matter, are
you just jealous?''
   Mitchell said Kahn ``told me to let DOE deal with security, and
you just butt out.''
   ``From the beginning there has been reluctance among senior
managers at the laboratory to acknowledge there was a drug issue in
classified areas of the laboratory,'' Mitchell said.
   Mitchell said the volume of drug trafficking at Livermore ``has
the potential to endanger national security.'' Under questioning by
Dingell, Buda agreed that the sale of computers and other sensitive
laboratory equipment in drug transactions ``could jeopardize
national defense secrets.''
   Dingell said the subcommittee staff has evidence that senior DOE
officials exerted pressure on authorities at Livermore to shut down
Operation Snowstorm prematurely and to conceal Operation Snowstorm
from House investigators.

   English, Dutch and West German
fans brawled outside boarded-up bars after a championship soccer
game Wednesday but patrolling riot squads prevented large-scale
violence.
   Some officers held unmuzzled dogs on chains as they patrolled
near bars still open. Duesseldorf mobilized more than 2,300 police
officers.
   More than 200 people had been detained by Wednesday night,
according to official and unofficial figures. Police said most
would be held only briefly.
   Most bars in Duesseldorf's Old City were closed, and many
boarded up to avoid the kind of damage caused during street fights
the night before.
   More than 40,000 English and Dutch soccer fans were in
Duesseldorf for the European Soccer Championship series match
between their national teams.
   Fistfights broke out throughout the city after the Netherlands
won the game 3-1. Soccer fans filled the streets and the area near
the main railroad station, where West German, Dutch and English
brawled Wednesday night.
   Riot police broke up the fight and arrested about 20 people,
witnesses said.
   Minor scuffles between West German and English rowdies were
reported inside the station while the English waited for trains
leaving the city. Riot police were seen taking three people away.
   British fans sang ``God Save the Queen'' and shouted insults at
West German rivals, the British news agency Press Association
reported.
   By midnight the station and surrounding streets were nearly
clear of everyone except police, and streets of the Old City were
reported quiet.
   Just before the game, 150 West Germans were detained temporarily
while trying to march from downtown to the stadium. Police said
those arrested planned to incite battles between English and Dutch
fans, and that 39 other West Germans were detained for the same
reason.
   Thirteen English hooligans were arrested for disorderly conduct
or drunkenness earlier Wednesday.
   No violence was reported during the game.
   British Sports Minister Colin Moynihan was in Duesseldorf on a
fact-finding mission for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   He told Press Association the English soccer rowdies ``are worse
than animals, because I know of no animals which would behave in
this manner.''
   Police spokesman Wolfgang Rodax said riot officers rounded up
about 200 drunken English fans near the rail station in the
afternoon and took them to the stadium by bus _ ``to defuse the
volatile situation at the train station.'' He said police dispersed
about 200 Dutch fans who were planning to ``move in on the train
station to confront'' the English.
   West Germany's ZDF television showed a man bleeding from the
head after a street fight. Also shown on West German TV was a
pistol that was confiscated, but the owner was not identified.
   Police used breathing devices to test alcohol levels before
letting fans into the stadium and scanned them with metal detectors
for knives and other weapons.
   Bert Millichip, chairman of the British Football (Soccer)
Association, told Press Association in Duesseldorf: ``People say
that if there was not a football match these hooligans wouldn't be
here _ and you cannot argue against that principle. ... These
people should not have been allowed to come here in the first
instance.''
   British clubs were barred from European Cup tournaments after a
rampage by British fans that left 39 people dead at a European Cup
final in Brussels, Belgium, three years ago. The ban did not
include the national team.

<HEAD>Former Guerrilla Leader Mario Firmenich Given Life In Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge sentenced a
former guerilla leader to life in prison Wednesday for the murders
of an Argentine businessman and his bodyguard and for his role in
the attempted murder of a Cabinet member.
   Mario Firmenich, who led the Montoneros guerrillas and is
already serving a life prison sentence, will serve a maximum 30
years in prison under terms of an extradition agreement with
Brazil, which returned him to Argentina in 1984.
   Federal Judge Martin Irurzun ruled that Firmenich, 40, killed
businessman Francisco Soldatti and his bodyguard, policeman Ricardo
Duran, in 1979. Firmenich was also found guilty as
``co-determinator'' in the 1979 wounding of former Treasury
Secretary Juan Alemann in an attack in downtown Buenos Aires.
   Among evidence presented were press communiques issued by the
Montoneros under Firmenich's leadership, including an instruction
manual telling how to carry out commando-style attacks against the
government and its forces.
   Firmenich was given a life term earlier for the 1974 kidnapping
of grain industrialists Juan and Jorge Born, whose bodyguards were
killed in the abduction. The Born brothers were freed after payment
of a $60 million ransom.
   The Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected appeals filed by
Firmenich and his lawyers for his release from a Buenos Aires
penitentiary.
   Firmenich led the Montoneros during the turbulent 1970s when
Argentina was wracked by social and economic chaos. The Montoneros
battled police and the armed forces and kidnapped foreign and local
industrialists for ransom before being virtually eliminated.
   The chaos continued even after a 1976 military coup replaced
President Isabel Peron, eventually resulting in a bloody campaign
by military forces to wipe out leftist subversion.
   That campaign, dubbed the ``dirty war,'' resulted in the
disappearance and presumed deaths of at least 9,000 suspected
subversives. Human rights groups say up to 30,000 people
``disappeared'' before civilian rule was restored in 1983 with the
election of President Raul Alfonsin.

   A booby-trap bomb planted in a
military van exploded Wednesday night in Lisburn, killing six
soldiers who had taken part in a charity race and injuring at least
10 civilians, police said.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing and for the
shooting death earlier Wednesday of a Protestant paramilitary chief
in Belfast.
   Belfast police said the ``no warning'' bomb went off as about
4,000 people completed a charity race in Lisburn, a town 7 miles
southeast of Belfast that is the main base of the British army in
Northern Ireland.
   An 80-year-old man and a 2-year-old boy were among 10 civilians
injured in the explosion, which police said happened shortly after
9 p.m (4 p.m. EDT). None of the civilians suffered serious
injuries, police said.
   The soldiers had driven to the market square in an unmarked
military van to take part in the amateur race, police said. While
they were away, guerrillas wired a booby-trap bomb to the van's
chassis.
   The bomb exploded when the soldiers returned from the race and
had driven off just a few yards, police said.
   Four soldiers died at the scene, one was pronounced dead on
arrival at a hospital and a sixth died after undergoing surgery for
head injuries, police said.
   The death toll was the highest against the army since a 1982
bombing in the a pub in Ballykelly, near Londonderry, killed 11
soldiers and six civilians. An IRA offshoot, the Irish National
Liberation Army, claimed responsibility.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that the IRA said it
carried out Wednesday's bombing in a message to news media in
Belfast.
   Reporter Daryl Fitzsimons of Downtown Radio, a Belfast station,
who was at the scene, reported: ``The bomb exploded ... blowing the
heart out of the town center.''
   Eyewitness Sandford Fitzpatrick said on the broadcast: ``I saw
one person in the middle of the road with blood coming out of his
head ... It's absolute chaos here ... There were thousands of
people in the town for the race, from all over Ireland.''
   The man killed in Belfast earlier Wednesday was identified by
the Royal Ulster Constabulary as Bobby ``Blood'' Seymour, 33, a
known gunman for the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force.
   He was jailed for life in 1981 for the murder of a Catholic who
was believed to be a high-ranking IRA member. Seymour was released
when an appeals court dismissed an informer's testimony.
   Several hours after Seymour was shot in an alley behind his
video shop in east Belfast by two masked gunmen who fled in a car,
the IRA made telephone calls to the media claiming responsibility
for his killing. It said the shooting was in retaliation for
attacks on Roman Catholics.
   The car used by the attackers later was found abandoned in the
Markets area of the city, and the police said a man arrested there
was being questioned about the slaying.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.

   Much of the Northeast and Midwest scorched under another day of
temperatures in the 90s, and heat problems exacerbated by a severe
drought in many areas left people without relief.
   ``It's the kind of thing that makes you sweat even with air
conditioning,'' said Fred Martin, director of utilities in Camden,
N.J.
   An estimated 196,000 people hit the beaches in New York City,
where the temperature hit 96 degrees, tying a 97-year-old record.
It was 98 degrees at midafternoon in Boston, exceeding by 2 degrees
the record set in 1956.
   Records fell like drops of sweat, and the weather officially
became a heat wave, meaning at least three straight days of
temperatures at 90 or higher, in Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
the National Weather Service said.
   Elsewhere, five tornadoes touched down in Colorado in an area 55
miles long from north to south, injuring seven people, none
seriously.
   One tornado hit near Denver's Stapleton International Airport,
where the air traffic control tower was evacuated for about 25
minutes, Stapleton spokesman Richard Bouleware said. There was no
immediate word on effects on air traffic.
   Touchdowns also were reported near Barr Lake, and on Denver's
east side, where hundreds of stately trees collapsed across lawns
and crushed several cars.
   Thunderstorms hit parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas
Panhandle. An inch and a half of rain fell at Amarillo, Texas, and
scattered showers continued over Florida. Thunderstorms also
developed over parts of Michigan.
   West of the Rocky Mountains, it was sunny, with temperatures
mostly in the 80s.
   The severe heat to the east is being caused by a high-pressure
system off the mid-Atlantic coast pumping in hot air from the south
central part of the country, National Weather Serivice
meteorologist Mike Wyllie said.
   ``Over hundreds and hundreds of miles, the ground is very, very
dry,'' said Peter Lamb of the Illinois State Water Survey. ``So
what the sun is doing is heating the ground and the ground is
heating the air.''
   Efforts to cool off put extraordinary pressure on municipal
water and utility systems, and some communities began ordering
conservation. In northern New Jersey, authorities followed young
people, shutting fire hydrants.
   ``The kids open them up as soon as they get out of school,''
said John Oliver, a regional fire dispatcher in Hudson County, N.J.
``People couldn't flush their toilets. There was low water pressure
all over the place.''
   Low water pressure canceled classes for 1,150 pupils at East
Dover Elementary School in New Jersey. Students in communities in
Maryland and Connecticut were sent home early because of excessive
heat.
   Air quality was unhealthy in parts of the Northeast, especially
where the heat combined with air pollution.
   The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality
Engineering said 18 towns have declared water supply emergencies.
Of them, 14 have imposed voluntary water restrictions, spokeswoman
Nan Kates said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Santa Barbara, Calif., to 103 degrees at Needles, Calif.
   The forecast for Thursday called for widely scattered showers
and thunderstorms from New England across the Ohio Valley,
Arkansas, southern Missouri and parts of the southern Plains.
Thunderstorms will develop in the mountains of Nevada and the
Pacific Northwest. Showers and thunderstorms will continue in
southern Florida.
   High temperatures will be in the 80s to mid-90s over most of the
nation; the 60s and 70s from the Great Lakes region across the
upper Mississippi Valley to eastern North Dakota and along the
Pacific coast; and 100 to 110 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   Some records set Wednesday:
   Albany, N.Y., 96 degrees, broke mark of 95 set in 1891.
   Boston, 98 degrees, broke mark of 96 set in 1956.
   Burlington, Vt., 96 degrees, broke mark of 93 set in 1891.
   Detroit, 94 degrees, broke mark of 93 set in 1976.
   Fort Wayne, Ind., 95 degrees, broke mark of 94 set in 1954
   Hartford, Conn., 97 degrees, broke mark of 95 set in 1957.
   Newark, N.J., 99 degrees, tied mark set in 1945.
   Philadelphia, 97 degrees, tied mark set in 1957.
   Pittsburgh, 93 degrees, broke mark of 92 set in 1967.
   Portland, Maine, 96 degrees, broke mark of 94 set in 1956.
   Syracuse, N.Y., 97 degrees, broke mark of 92 set in 1972.
   Youngstown, Ohio, 92 degrees, tied mark set in 1967.

   More than 1,000 people rallied in a
Slovenian city Wednesday for the release of two jailed journalists
and the election of one as president of the Slovenian Youth
Organization, Yugoslavian reporters said.
   Posters in the city of Maribor claimed that Janez Jansa and
David Tasic, who have written articles critical of the military,
were arrested illegally. In one article, Jansa wrote the military
was planning a coup in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most liberal
republic, a charge the military denied.
   Military authorities detained Jansa May 31 and Tasic five days
later in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana on charges of
possessing a highly sensitive military document whose contents were
not disclosed.
   The posters showed pictures of the two journalists and Ivan
Borstner, an army sergeant-major arrested last week on suspicion of
having leaked the document to the journalists.
   Jansa is one of three candidates for the presidency of the
Slovenian Youth Organization. According to Yugoslav journalists in
Slovenia, his election manifesto was read at the Maribor rally.
Maribor is about 10 miles south of the Austrian border and 60 miles
northeast of Ljubljana.
   Jansa has called for the youth group to become an independent
political force in Slovenia, said the reporters, speaking on
condition of anonymity. It now is a member of the Socialist
Alliance, a Communist-led mass organization.
   A petition calling for the release of the trio was circulated at
the rally. About 16,000 people have signed petitions for their
release and companies, trade unions, church groups and Communist
Party cells have also been pooling money into a special defense
fund.
   Also Wednesday, the Defense Board of Yugoslavia's Parliament
said it was concerned about public skepticism of the military
authorities' competence in investigating the case.
   According to the Tanjug news agency, the board expressed
``concern over the spreading of unfounded rumours and statements
that in advance express doubt and mistrust in the objectivity and
correctness of the proceedings conducted by competent military,
legal organs.''
   On Tuesday, Joze Smole, president of the Slovenian Socialist
Alliance, said military authorites should ``give the public a
general idea of what sort of secrets the document contains.''
   He also urged military investigators to complete their work as
quickly as possible ``since any delay could only have an adverse
effect on public opinion.''
   A military investigative judge heard testimony by editors of the
non-conformist youth weekly Mladina, which published articles by
the two arrested journalists.
   The judge is to hear testimony Thursday by editors from other
publications that also carried articles by Jansa and Tasic.

   An Australian woman and a Thai man were
sentenced to death Wednesday for trafficking in 12 pounds of heroin
the woman carried in her 14-month-old son's stroller.
   The Bangkok Criminal Court reduced an earlier death sentence
against the woman's common law husband to life imprisonment after
he admitted to heroin possession and cooperated with authorities.
   Nola Blake; the man she lived with in suburban Sydney, Paul
Hudson; and Supoj Kittidejdamkern were arrested in January 1987 and
charged with possessing heroin with intention to sell.
   Police said Ms. Blake and Hudson, who is also Australian,
obtained the heroin from Supoj for sale in Australia.
   Ms. Blake and Hudson, both 37, were arrested in front of a
department store while pushing their son in a stroller that
contained the heroin, police said. The baby was flown to Australia
to be cared for by relatives in Sydney.
   ``I knew it was coming. I knew it was coming,'' Ms. Blake said
after the verdict, shaking her head as she walked from the court
back to jail.
   Ms. Blake translated the verdict for Hudson, who appeared pale
and shaken.

   Southern Baptists, who a day earlier
elected a fundamentalist to lead them for a 10th straight year, on
Wednesday toned down a hallmark doctrine emphasizing members'
rights to dissent from the clergy.
   That doctrine _ called the ``priesthood of the believer'' _ also
has stood as a hub of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. The
modified interpretation espoused here was denounced by critics as
reflecting a new clerical authoritarianism.
   ``What it's talking about is denominational dictatorship,'' said
the Rev. Buckner Fanning of San Antonio. ``It says the only way to
lead is by blind obedience.''
   About 200 Baptists assembled late in the afternoon at the Alamo
andceremoniously tore up copies of a resolution passed by the
convention on ``priesthood of the believer.''
   The action ``repudiates the heritage of of Baptists,'' said the
Rev. Randall Lolley, pressured out of the presidency of
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary along with four acadmic
colleagues by new rules imposed by fundamentalist trustees.
   The demonstrators sang 16th-century Protestant reformer Martin
Luther's rousing hymn, ``A Mighty Fortress is Our God.''
   In the resolution, the convention declared that the idea of the
equal ``priesthood'' of believers should not be applied contrary to
``authority of the pastor, which is seen in the command to the
local church.''
   The concept ``has been used to justify wrongly the attitude that
a Christian may believe whatever he so chooses and still be
considered a loyal Southern Baptist.''
   The ``doctrine in no way gives license to misinterpret, explain
away, demythologize or extrapolate out elements of the supernatural
from the Bible,'' the resolution said.
   Its passage came after a tumultuous session of representatives
of the 14.7 million-member denomination, the nation's largest
Protestant body. For Southern Baptists, the governing body is the
local church.
   Protests that the resolution meant a ``papal system'' of
clerical control and that it undermined Jesus' view that ministers
were servants not masters crackled through the convention hall.
   The Rev. Adrian Rogers of Memphis, Tenn., departing president of
the denomination, halted the discussion and put the matter to a
vote. By a show of hands, it passed by about a two-thirds majority.
   The action came a day after the factionally divided convention
had elected another fundamentalist, the Rev. Jerry Vines of
Jacksonville, Fla., to succeed Rogers. Vines takes over at the
close of the meeting Thursday.
   He narrowly defeated the moderate candidate, the Rev. Richard
Jackson of Phoenix, Ariz.
   Through presidenial appointive powers, the fundamentalist wing
gradually has brought the vast network of denominational operations
under its control. It would take a decade, even with unlikely
successive moderate wins, to reverse the pattern.
   The fundamentalist leadership has stacked institutional boards,
setting stricter rules for literalistic interpretations of the
Bible, and inaugurating screening processes to assure adherence.
   The new qualifying limitations on the universal ``priesthood''
concept was seen as the latest move toward extending clerical
supervision.
   Historically, Baptists, more than any other Protestants, have
stressed freedom, both of individuals from clerical domination and,
of the church from the state and state from the church.
   Besides the equal priesthood-of-all concept, the historic
emphasis has been on autonomy of local churches and ``soul
competence'' of individuals to interpret the Bible.
   Fanning, pastor of Trinity Baptist Church here, said the
universal priesthood notion dates to Protestant Reformers Martin
Luther and John Huss, burned at the stake over it.
   ``It's one of the fundamentals that the fundamentalists
ignore,'' he said, noting that it is also mandated in the New
Testament, calling all believers _ not just the clergy _ ``a royal
priesthood.''
   The the Rev. James Dunn of Washington, D.C., director of the
inter-Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, said the
fundamentalists ``don't know what Baptist means.''
   Meanwhile, the denomination's ``peace committee,'' set up to try
to settle the prolonged factional conflict, went out of business,
lamenting that peace has not been achieved.
   ``We deplore the divisive political activities and counter
activities by all sides this past year,'' said the chairman, the
Rev. Charles Fuller of Roanoke, Va.

   Bob Landecker wasn't going to let a

after what he did to get it.
   Landecker was hired Monday by radio station KKSU after he spent
the day sitting on Main Street with a sign that said, ``I am Bob
Landecker. I need a job.''
   Cliff Shank, who needed a program director and afternoon
announcer for KKSU, stopped by.
   ``Anyone who has got the gumption to do that might be someone
worth looking at,'' Shank said.
   Landecker went on the air Tuesday.
   ``I started breaking out right before my first show,'' said
Landecker, who worked in a secluded room.
   Landecker said he once worked for a public relations company in
Ponca City, Okla. He said he got the idea to advertise for a job
from a radio announcer in Tulsa who rented a billboard and received
several offers.

   Hollywood has gone crackers over its newest
star.
   A replica of a slab from the Hollywood Walk of Fame was
presented Wednesday to ``Belle,'' a big cheese from Wisconsin.
   Photographers seemed to take the presentation in stride, even
though the ``Belle of Wisconsin'' said ``cheese'' without smiling,
and doesn't come close to the kind of Hollywood cheesecake they're
accustomed to.
   ``Belle'' weighs in at 40,000 pounds, is 20 feet long, over 5{
feet wide and 5-feet-10. More than 3,500 cows and 37,000 dairymen
worked to produce it earlier this year in Little Chute, Wis.
   The block of cheese was presented with the star replica as
promoters prepared for a cross-country tour in a specially designed
``cheesemobile'' trailer, complete with glass-sided walls.
   The chunk of Cheddar has been acclaimed by Guinness as the
world's largest, outdoing the previous Wisconsin-bred titleholder,
``The Golden Giant,'' by 5,409 pounds.
   ``Belle,'' accompanied on tour by ``The Big Cheese Escort,''
Susan Hughes, will parade through 36 cities with a dozen hungry
mice in hot pursuit.
   The whole affair is being sponsored by the Wisconsin Milk
Marketing Board Inc., to promote the state, which supplies nearly
40 percent of the country's cheese.

   Boston sportscaster Bob Gamere was stabbed three
times early Wednesday near Fenway Park and was in serious condition
after undergoing four hours of surgery, authorities said.
   Gamere, 49, was in serious but stable condition after surgery to
treat multiple stab wounds to his neck, chest and right leg, Beth
Israel Hospital spokeswoman Laurie Veno said.
   Gamere was found about 1:30 a.m. lying face down on the median
strip of Boylston Street's 1100 block, after a man in a nearby
apartment building heard the sportscaster's cries for help, police
said.
   No arrests have been made. Gamere told police he was stabbed by
one man, police spokeswoman Jill Reilly said.
   Gamere was sports director and anchor at WNAC, now Channel 7,
from 1970-80 and was co-host ``Voice of Sports'' on WMRE radio for
three years. He joined WLVI, Channel 56, in 1984 and became weekend
sports anchor in 1987.

   Serial killer Edmund Kemper told
authorities Wednesday that he is fit for freedom but society isn't
ready to accept him, and was denied parole by state officials.
   In his first parole hearing in six years, Kemper, 40, said he
believed he should remain in prison for the rest of his life for
killing eight women, including his mother, and decapitating seven
of them.
   ``I think I could handle a parole ... but I believe
wholeheartedly that society is not ready in any shape or form for
me,'' he said. ``I can't fault them for that.''
   Three members of the state Board of Prison Terms, the agency
that decides release dates for inmates sentenced to life terms,
ruled in a unanimous decision after a three-hour hearing that
Kemper is unfit for parole.
   The panel said Kemper's crimes ``shocked the public conscience''
and cited the ``deparavity and brutality'' of the murders.
   Once dubbed the ``Ogre of Aptos,'' the 295-pound, 6-foot-9 hulk
with a 136 IQ began his two-year killing spree three years after
leaving a state hospital where he served a conviction for killing
his grandparents when he was 15.
   Beginning in May 1972, he killed six women he picked up
hitchhiking, then killed his mother and her closest friend in April
1973, before turning himself in. Seven of the victims were
decapitated, including his mother.
   Jack Fleming, a prison psychologist who has treated the killer
for the past eight years, said he found Kemper suitable for release.
   Art Danner, a prosecutor from Santa Cruz County, where the
bodies of six of he victims were found, said society should never
have to take the risk that Kemper might kill again.
   Parole board member David Brown commended Kemper for his
exemplary behavior in prison, where he has been active with Bible
study groups, become an award-winning potter, and directs a
books-for-the-blind project.
   Brown said it is unlikely Kemper will be paroled within the
``next few years'' because his previous murder convictions,
unstable social history and the brutal nature of his crimes.
   Kemper will have the right to another parole hearing in three
years.

<TEXT>
   A court order barring a woman from having an
abortion expired Wednesday, after two U.S. Supreme Court justices
and Indiana's highest court rejected emergency requests to continue
the ban.
   The Elkhart Superior Court order expired at 4 p.m., removing the
last obstacle preventing the woman, identified in court documents
by the pseudonym Jane Smith, from ending her pregnancy.
   The woman's attorney, Richard Waples of the Indiana Civil
Liberties Union, said he didn't know if or when she would undergo
an abortion. ``That's her decision,'' he said. ``It's really
nobody's business, not even mine.''
   Before the lower court order expired, U.S. Supreme Court
Justices John Paul Stevens and Byron R. White refused to issue
emergency orders sought by the Evansville man who claims to be the
father of the fetus.
   The man claimed his interests should be weighed before the woman
was allowed to have an abortion.
   Robert J. Palmer, attorney for the man identified in court
documents only as John Doe, said his client was ``very upset. It
was a difficult telephone call to make to him.''
   Late Wednesday afternoon, the state Supreme Court also rejected
a request to reconsider its earlier decision not to prevent the
abortion.
   Palmer said he plans to appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court,
which agreed Tuesday to accept jurisdiction over the case while
refusing to bar an abortion while the substantive legal arguments
were made.
   The woman is about eight weeks pregnant, according to court
documents. After she scheduled an abortion, the man went to court
two weeks ago.
   The case is the second in Indiana in which a man claiming to be
the father of a fetus has tried to stop an abortion. In April, a
Terre Haute woman underwent an abortion in defiance of a court
order barring the operation.
   That case, also initiated by a man claiming to be the father, is
being reviewed by the Indiana Court of Appeals.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega says he is
moving away from Marxist wage-and-price controls to surmount the
economic damage inflicted on Nicaragua by a 6{-year-old war with
U.S.-backed rebels.
   Ortega announced the moves toward what he called ``freedom of
prices'' in a two-hour televised speech Tuesday night, but did not
provide many details.
   In what may have been an attempt to appease Marxist hardliners,
he said the the Nicaraguan economy is now a ``free market in a
revolutionary state oriented toward socialism.''
   As Ortega outlined it, the leftist government will stop
mandating most salaries and prices. It has been controlling the
prices of primary products and of most imports and exports.
   Despite Ortega's speech, the situation was unclear Wednesday.
The Labor Ministry issued a statement calling for wages to rise 30
percent and the government announced a huge devaluation in the
Nicaraguan currency, the cordoba.
   The ministry said the official exchange rate would go from 13
cordobas to the dollar to 80 cordobas. At the Eastern Market, where
prices for dollars far exceed the official ones, vendors said they
didn't know what Ortega's announcement will mean.
   Ortega said economic changes were needed to spur production and
enable the economy to survive the damage dealt by the war with the
Contras, as the rebels are known.
   The United States has coupled its support for the rebels with a
trade embargo against Nicaragua. The Sandinistas say the war has
inflicted $3 billion in damage.
   U.S. officials regard Nicaragua as virtually bankrupt, despite
huge infusions of Soviet bloc aid.
   This small Central American nation has a foreign debt of more
than $6 billion, an inflation rate of about 4,000 percent and a
serious trade deficit. The average urban worker's purchasing power
dropped almost 90 percent since 1980.
   The Sandinistas took power in a 1979, ousting dictator Anastasio
Somoza amid widespread popular support. They promised social
programs to end the years of inequities.
   But they have delivered on few of those promises. In 1981, the
Contras, then mostly disgruntled former national guardsmen, began
trying to oust the new government.
   Scores of government clinics and schools in the northern and
central war zones were destroyed and agricultural production, the
nation's export mainstay, dropped dramatically as families fled war
zones and farm workers joined the civil war.
   ``We are not defending a capitalist system, nor are we
establishing a socialist state where private enterprise ceases to
exist,'' Ortega said in his speech Tuesday.
   He said the government does not plan to abolish private
enterprise as Cuba did ``because there would be political
pluralistic demonstrations against the revolution.''
   Nicaragua is ``not at the stage where the application of
socialist measures contribute to the consolidation of the
revolutionary process,'' he said.
   The government last enacted major economic changes in February,
setting wages at between $50 to $750 monthly. Strict prices were
set on almost all basic products. But black marketeers circumvented
the measures almost immediately.
   In April, the government began laying off 20,000 public
employees, encouraging them to seek agricultural work.
   Public dissatisfaction with the state of the economy has become
more apparent the past few months, with the reopening of opposition
radio stations and the newspaper La Prensa. There has been strong
criticism of the chronic shortages.
   The measures announced Tuesday night would maintain a subsidy on
public transportation and regulate the prices of basic, but always
scarce, commodities such as sugar, cooking oil, soap and rice.
   Ortega said the civil war was unlikely to end soon and called on
Nicaraguans to ``be prepared for new, larger, extraordinary
mobilization of our forces agains the counterrevolution project of
the Yankee administration.''
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a cease-fire agreement in
March but peace talks later broke down. Both sides accused the
other Wednesday of violating the cease-fire.

   Leftist rebels dragged a U.S. agricultural
adviser and a Peruvian colleague from their farm truck and shot
them to death, officials said Wednesday. It was the second death of
an American in Peru's insurgency.
   Police Col. Cirilo Pacheco said three Shining Path highland
guerrillas halted the agronomists' pickup truck Monday evening on
an isolated road in the central Andes Mountains, checked their
papers and then shot each man twice in the back of the head.
   Pacheco and the National Agrarian Research Institute identified
the victims as Constantine Orson Gregory, 25, of Los Angeles, and
Gustavo Rojas, 35, of Lima. A spokesman for a U.S. company in whose
agricultural project Gregory was involved confirmed the
identification.
   Reporters on the scene said the guerrillas wrote in red ink
across a notebook belonging to Gregory, ``This is the way the
lackeys of Yankee imperialism die.''
   The police colonel said the attackers dynamited the agronomists'
truck and escaped. He said 30 suspects have been arrested in sweeps
of the region.
   The two men and Gregory's American wife, who is expecting a
baby, were living in Aramachay, a hamlet without electricity or
piped water 15 miles north of Huancayo, a major city in the central
Andes 125 miles east of Lima, institute officials said.
   Gregory's wife, Dolores, was not in the truck.
   The attack came four days after pro-Cuban guerrillas lobbed
three mortar rounds at the residence of U.S. Ambassador Alexander
Watson in Lima, causing minor damage but no injuries.
   In another attack Tuesday, a column of Shining Path rebels
swarmed into Huallay village in the highland state of Ayacucho,
killing 14 peasants who belonged to a civil defense patrol
organized by the army, police said.
   The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday that Gregory and Rojas were
teaching peasant farmers methods to improve production of sheep and
small farm animals.
   The Shining Path, an 8-year-old Maoist insurgency, has
frequently assassinated development workers in Peru's impoverished
highlands in an effort to spawn economic chaos.
   The embassy refused on the record to identify the victims or
confirm their nationalities before positive identification was
made. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
embassy sent a team to the area to identify the victims.
   Gregory had been working on the project only a few months and
was preparing to return to the United States in August to pursue a
Ph.D. degree, a U.S. development official told The Associated Press.
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
described Gregory as ``just a young kid wanting some experience.''
He said Gregory was married this year in Huancayo.
   The embassy said the men worked for the institute on a project
funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development near
Huancayo.
   Institute spokesman Javier Recuenco told The Associated Press
the two were en route from Aramachay to buy supplies in the town of
Sincos five miles away, when the attack occurred.
   In Morrilton, Ark., Henk Knipscheer, program manager for Winrock
International, on Wednesday said Gregory was involved in Winrock's
program to assist agricultural research in developing countries, in
conjunction with the U.S. AID operation.
   ``I'm extremely disappointed and devastated (over the killings)
since we had here a project that was working directly with farmers
and for the direct benefit of farmers ...'' Knipscheer said. ``We
cannot understand how political resistance groups could take
offense to such activities,''
   Police said the bodies were brought to a morgue late Wednesday
in Concepcion, a town between Aramachay and Huancayo.
   In the only other U.S. death linked to the guerrilla fight, a
Texas woman was among seven passengers killed and 28 wounded when
guerrillas bombed a tourist train heading for the Inca ruins of
Machu Picchu in June 1986.
   AID has about 20 Americans in Peru and employs dozens of other
U.S. and Peruvian citizens under contract agreements, the Lima AID
office said. The agency spends more than $50 million yearly on
agriculture, health and food relief programs, officials said.
   The Shining Path guerrillas launched their insurgency in 1980 in
nearby Ayacucho state. Although the Andes remain their stronghold,
the violence has spread through much of the country.
   The government says more than 10,000 people have been slain in
the Shining Path's drive to impose Marxist rule based on the ideas
of China's Mao-Tse Tung.

   The Rev. Jerry Vines, who narrowly defeated a moderate Tuesday,
said the denomination has turned rightward because of ``strong
grass-roots feelings on the part of our people.''
   Vines also told a news conference he hoped ``we can move in the

   Vines defeated the Rev. Richard Jackson by 15,804 to 15,112. But
similarly close votes in the past have not deterred extension of

   Scientists built a machine that could make

   The machine has preserved sheep and pig hearts up to 24 hours,
and should be ready in three years to preserve human hearts,
livers, kidneys and other tissues, including limbs, for 72 hours or
more, said co-inventor Ralph Purdy, a University of California,

   Technology now in routine use by transplant centers preserves
hearts for only four to five hours, livers for 12 hours and kidneys

   Retail sales grew a lackluster 0.1 percent in
May, the government said Wednesday in a report analysts predicted
should help ease fears of inflationary pressures in the economy.
   The Commerce Department said sales by retailers, which represent
about one-third of U.S. economic activity, edged up a scant 0.1
percent in May to $131.9 billion, after a 0.4 percent drop in April.
   Much of the slowdown came from two successive drops in auto
sales, but other categories, including department store sales, also
were anemic.
   ``If you put the two months together, there is not much evidence
of strength,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with The Futures
Group, a Washington-based consulting firm. ``Department store
sales, which are a major barometer, continue to be very weak.''

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
foreign trade widened in the first three months of the year to
$39.75 billion as the first deficit in investment earnings in 30
years offset a sharp improvement in the merchandise trade balance,
the government reported Wednesday.
   The imbalance in the country's current account balance from
January through March surged by 18.6 percent from a fourth quarter
total of $33.5 billion and served as a stark reminder that the
country's trade problems are far from over despite a boom in U.S.
exports.
   The current account is the most important of all the trade
statistics because it covers not only merchandise trade but also
trade in the services category, which reflects primarily the flow
of investment earnings between countries.

   President Reagan said Wednesday it was vital
that the United States ``restore the threat'' of military pressure
on the Sandinista government in Nicaragua to bring about democratic
reforms.
   While Reagan said he had not decided whether to ask Congress for
new military aid package for the Contra rebels in the wake of their
collapsed peace talks with the Sandinistas, he did say, ``I think
is so apparent that this is what is necessary, it would be
ridiculous for us _ for anyone _ to oppose it.''
   The president renewed the prospect of pushing a military aid
package as leaders of the Contra resistance met with members of
Congress and Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the

   The Energy Department prematurely shut down an
undercover investigation of widespread drug trafficking at a
top-secret California nuclear weapons laboratory and tried to
prevent Congress from finding out, House investigators were told
Wednesday.
   At the time the drug investigation, code-named ``Operation
Snowstorm,'' was killed, agents were still pursuing leads on 127
employees at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near San
Francisco, who were suspected drug users or dealers, witnesses said.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the nine-month investigation was
abruptly halted in September 1986 because officials were fearful of
publicity about rampant drug trafficking at Livermore, where highly
classified research into President Reagan's Star Wars missile
defense system is conducted.

   Rebel archbishop Marcel Lefebvre
threatened the first split in the Roman Catholic church in 118
years by announcing Wednesday he will consecrate four bishops June
30 without papal authority.
   The 82-year-old traditionalist said he can ``no longer trust
Rome.''
   Bishop Henry Schwery, president of the Swiss Conference of
Bishops, has said such a breach of discipline would formalize a
schism. It would be the first since the Old Catholics left the
church in 1870 because they did not accept papal infallibility.
   Pope Paul VI barred Lefebvre in 1976 from saying Mass and giving
the sacraments, but the archbishop has ordained more than 200
priests who continue to use the 16th century Tridentine Mass, a
Latin rite for which special permission is required.
   Lefebvre's declaration Wednesday followed months of efforts at
reconciliation sponsored by Pope John Paul II.

   Yoshifumi Kaneda is very proud of his new Honda. It
looks like an ordinary 2-door Accord _ except that it was made in
the United States.
   ``I like it a lot because it's unique in Japan,'' said Kaneda,
36, who works in the Tokyo office of a French pharmaceutical
company.
   For one thing, it has left-hand drive, while Japanese domestic
cars have right-hand drive, like cars in Britain.
   ``I was thinking about buying a BMW first, but everyone has BMWs
and Mercedes in Japan these days,'' Kaneda said. ``So, instead, I
decided to go for something very different, very unique, very
peculiar.''
   Kaneda's Honda is one of the very first Accord coupes made in
the United States and imported to Japan starting in April.
   A upsurge in the value of the Japanese yen against the dollar by
more than 50 percent in two years has made Japanese products less
competitive in overseas markets. Export-based Japanese companies
wasted no time shifting production bases abroad, looking for
cheaper production and labor costs.
   Today, products made at those overseas factories are beginning
to flood into Japan. And the affluent Japanese consumers, with
their ever-stronger yen and a big appetite for distinguished
products, are eagerly buying them up.
   In fiscal 1987, Japan imported $1.6 billion worth of products
from overseas subsidiaries of Japanese companies, according to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The ministry projects
that figure will jump to about $2.5 billion this year.
   Following the much-scrutinized reimporation of Accords from
Honda's Ohio factory, Mazda Motor Co. has decided to begin selling
its U.S.-made subcompact Probe later this month. Honda also imports
500 units of 1,500-cubic-centimeter motorcycles from its U.S.
factory in Marysville, Ohio.
   Kirin Brewery, Japan's largest beermaker, is now selling Kirin
Export made for sale in West Germany, while its rival Sapporo
Brewery imports a soft drink called Sapporo Wow from Hansen Foods
based in Los Angeles.
   Consumer analysts see the trend as an ideal mix of Japanese
traditional adoration for foreign products and the steadfast
confidence in domestic-made products.
   ``Today's young Japanese do not know the days when Japanese
products were notorious for being cheap but poorly made,'' said
Kazuma Shindo, a chief researcher at the Hakuhodo Consumer Research
Institute. ``Their perception of Japanese products usually is that
they are the most reliable in the world in quality but a bit
boring. For them, reimported goods satisfies their hunger for
identity without sacrificing the quality.''
   The idea of reimportation is not necessarily new for Japanese
companies.
   Electronics companies, most of them heavily export-dependent,
launched their offshore move immediately after the yen's
appreciation began in mid-1985.
   Sony Corp., often depicted as a symbol of Japan's export-based
economic miracle, imported TV tubes from its U.S. subsidiary in
1985. Also, Fujitsu has been importing computer disks from the
United States for more than two years.
   But analysts said the more recent reimport boom differs from
that of a few years ago.
   Geoffrey Wilkinson, a market analyst for Salomon Bros.
investment firm in Tokyo, said the reimport boom began as a means
of making greater profit, taking advantage of currency fluctuations.
   However, many companies now are reimporting products to protect
themselves politically from protectionist sentiment in the United
States, and to improve their image, he said.
   Honda officials said they were stunned by the response to their
reimport drive.
   ``We implemented the measure as part of our efforts to set up a
global network,'' said Hiroshi Ohshima, spokesman for Honda. ``But
to be honest, we did not anticipate such a response.''
   Ohshima said 1,500 units have been reserved already and the
waiting period can be as long as five months. Honda expects its
first year target of 5,000 units will be cleared easily. Ohshima
said by 1991, Honda wants to increase the reimports to as many
50,000 units.
   But some customers hope the reimported Accord will remain a rare
item in Japan.
   Yoshifumi Kaneda said that when he ordered his American Accord,
a friend did also. But the friend canceled his order when he
learned of the company's plan to import 5,000 units this year.
   ``He was looking for something different,'' said Kaneda. ``He
told me that he couldn't stand the idea that 4,999 others own the
same car as his. I am not sure if I would have bought this car if
Honda's plan was 20,000 units a year instead of 5,000.''

<HEAD>Women Priests Becoming Predominant In Sweedish Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three decades after breaking the
all-male tradition in the Church of Sweden, more and more women are
becoming priests, and some think the clergy could become a female
profession.
   The Lutheran state church was one of the last bastions of
conservatism to yield to feminism in this open-minded country,
where sexual equality has long been a watchword.
   Krister Stendahl, the bishop of Stockholm and former dean of the
Harvard Divinity School, calls it a blessing that a growing number
of women are wearing the white collar.
   ``One of the exciting things in our times and in theology is
that women are beginning to think not just equal to men, but are
trying to find whether they have insights'' which men do not have,
the bishop told Swedish radio.
   Annicka Kronberg, a former actress ordained in January, said she
found ``most men in my group (at divinity school) understood the
value of having more women and how we can enrich the language, the
forms and behavior'' in church.
   Ms. Kronberg's decision to leave a successful stage career for
the pulpit has drawn attention to the dramatic change since 1960
when the first woman was ordained.
   In the Stockholm Diocese, which sponsors special ``feminist
services,'' nearly half of the 481 priests are women. Women
comprise about 20 percent of the 4,913 priests throughout the
country.
   Last year, 43 women were among the 96 graduates of the
Theological Institute of Uppsala University. The female enrolment
was 53 percent, up from 38 percent 10 years ago, and the school has
introduced a course on ``feminine theology.''
   ``The question is now whether women priests are not actually
becoming the majority,'' said Eva Brunne, 34, a church official
whose work includes promoting feminist views in the church service.
   A predominance of women has pitfalls, said Ms. Brunne. ``It
would mean that the priesthood would become more and more of a
nursing profession,'' and the authoritative ``father'' image of the
priest might be lost, she said.
   Both men and women are needed, she said, and a 50-50 division
would be best.
   The 400-year-old Lutheran Evangelical Church of Sweden is
administered by Parliament and its bishops are appointed by the
government. Parish priests are chosen by local church councils and
are approved by the government. In Swedish, the word priest is used
for Catholic and Protestant clergymen.
   The church is financed by an ecclesiastical tax totalling about
$800 million included in the income tax bill. Non-church members
are exempt from 70 percent of the church tax.
   Most Christians in Sweden belong to the state church except
those who sign a declaration leaving it. The church counts as
members 92 percent of the population of 8.4 million, though only
about 10 percent are regular churchgoers.
   Thirty-six other religious groups are recognized in Sweden,
including Catholics, Moslems, Jews and various Protestant
denominations, some of which broke away from the established church
over the last century.
   A few churchmen still resist the female influx. In the Diocese
of Goteborg, Bishop Bertil Gartner's refusal to ordain women has
blown up into a national issue over the church's ecclesiastic
independence.
   Civil Minister Bo Holmberg, who oversees church affairs for the
government, has urged the bishop to reverse his policy, but the
churchman said he would follow his conscience. The Central
Committee of Women's Organizations has demanded his resignation.
   Birgitta Vidman of the Theological Institute believes one reason
for the rising number of women priests is the diminishing status of
the priesthood as a profession and the low salaries.
   ``It seems that men, to a higher degree than women, look for the
money and prestige that goes with a job,'' she said.
   Real power also is being stripped from the clergy, as other
state institutions take over secular responsibilities traditionally
administered by the church, such as registering births and deaths.
   ``I don't think women, deep down, are so power hungry and
sensitive to prestige,'' said Ms. Kronberg.
   Ms. Kronberg is still listed as an employee of one of
Stockholm's leading theaters, and says she may consider an
occasional role in the future.
   The gap between acting and preaching is not necessarily wide,
she said, recalling that her first Mass was ``much worse than a
premier.'' Both professions probe questions like ``the relationship
between people, how we live and should live, how we make our
choices.''
   She said her decison 10 years ago to study for the priesthood
dismayed some of her family, and may have contributed toward her
divorce. She said, ``My son told me, `Don't become a priest, Mum.
It's so boring in church'.''

Council of Churches recently offered some sharp criticisms of TV
preacher Jimmy Swaggart _ but not over the sexual exploits that got

   The Rev. Emilio Castro, an Uruguayan Methodist minister and the
council's general secretary, speaking at an ecumenical gathering

   ``If someone was thinking of giving $10 to Jimmy Swaggart and

   Castro said Swaggart, through his support for the military

   Whatever else it may have accomplished, the
deregulation movement of the past 10 years in American business and
finance has certainly complicated many people's lives.
   Crazy-quilt airline fares, nine-page telephone bills, the
bewildering array of mortgage choices open to home buyers _ the
evidence of deregulation's handiwork abounds.
   Some of the benefits of increased competition, innovation and
opportunity have come through as promised. For example,
deregulation has helped open up air travel to people who couldn't
afford it before.
   But while it has created many new opportunities, it also has
brought down some established enterprises, and cost the jobs of a
good many people who thought they were working in secure, long-term
careers.
   When you venture into back-to-nature economics, it turns out,
you find that it's a jungle out there.
   Though deregulation got its first big boosts in the Carter
administration, the campaign has come to be closely identified with
President Reagan over his two terms in office.
   The outcome of the presidential election this fall will
doubtless be read by pundits as a verdict on how the public feels
about the results of deregulation, and whether it wants to keep
heading in the same direction.
   But with all its disruptive influences, deregulation has
actually served to stabilize the national economy in some
significant ways, one analyst argues.
   Michael Drury at Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc. compared
the volatility of several key elements of the economy for the
10-year periods before and after 1978, when the Federal Reserve
took the important step of declaring an end to ceilings on bank
interest rates.
   Stock prices, for example, were three times more volatile in
1978-87 than they had been in 1968-77, he reported. Interest rates
were twice as volatile, using new bond issues by corporations as a
gauge.
   But Drury found that ``real'' interest rates _ the nominal rate
minus the rate of inflation _ have been more stable since
deregulation. ``This probably is a result of fixed-income markets
reacting to inflation faster and more efficiently in the 1980s,''
he said.
   Wages of production workers were three times more volatile in
the latter decade than in the earlier one. But the unemployment
rate varied less.
   While there was a period of great volatility in housing starts
in the early 1980s as financial deregulation first took hold,
``over the past five years single-family housing has been far more
stable due to the wider use of adjustable rate mortgages and larger
secondary markets for mortgage securities,'' Drury observed.
   With ceilings lifted on interest rates, he added, the economy is
no longer as vulnerable as it once was to periods in which the
supply of credit for mortgages and construction loans dries up,
creating a ``credit crunch.''
   Meanwhile, the gross national product, the output of all goods
and services in the economy, has grown at a steadier pace in the
past decade than in the previous one, Drury said.
   ``Over the past 10 years,'' he concluded, ``the U.S. economy, in
its broadest measure, has been relatively more stable than in the
decade before.''
   Though it has been by no means the only major influence on
trends in business activity, he argued, deregulation has played a
prominent part in making things happen that way.
   ``Participants in any marketplace are subject to much greater
stress in a free market, needing to adjust continually to new
conditions,'' he said. ``Yet the apparent payoff for the increased
variability in each individual market is greater stability in the
overall economy.''

<HEAD>Steve Sohmer Thriller Anticipated Washington Headlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Steve Sohmer began writing his novel
``Favorite Son,'' Gary Hart was a promising presidential aspirant
and the Iran-Contra scandal was still a dark secret.
   When Sohmer finished his tale of a leading presidential
candidate who's wounded on the Capitol steps in the assassination
of a top Contra leader and who is eventually undone by his deep
involvement with a woman, he had a political thriller combining
elements of Washington's hottest headlines.
   NBC's miniseries based on the novel will be televised before the
November presidential election.
   ``It began as an idea for a feature motion picture when I was
president of Columbia Pictures,'' said Sohmer, also a former
executive at NBC and CBS. ``I suggested it to a producer _ who
shall be nameless _ and he said, `Steve, that's a terrible idea.' I
got huffy and said I'd write it myself.''
   Sohmer completed the book in November 1986, before either big
news story broke. He showed the manuscript to his old boss, Brandon
Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, who bought it as a
miniseries.
   Although the senator appears to be the leading character, Sohmer
said it's really his staff assistant, Sally Crain, played by Linda
Kozlowski of the ```Crocodile' Dundee'' movies.
   ``She's smart as hell, highly motivated, a role model,'' he
said. ``But she has a pretty disorganized love life. After the
first draft I knew I had Sally right artistically. But I didn't
understand her. I took the book to Toni Grant, who counsels career
women. She told me that many have to be like men in their
professional lives. And they end up being victimized by the men
they associate with.''
   Crain becomes involved with a young FBI agent, played by Lance
Guest, who is assigned to investigate the assassination.
   The six-hour miniseries also stars Harry Hamlin as the senator,
Robert Loggia as a tough old FBI agent, James Whitmore as the
president, Ken McMillan as head of the FBI, Ronnie Cox as head of
the CIA, and Stepfanie Kramer as Sally's assistant.
   The show is also serving as a ``back door pilot'' for a possible
series starring Loggia as Nick Mancuso, the cynical FBI
investigator.
   ``I give NBC a lot of credit for doing this show in an election
year,'' said Sohmer, who is also serving as executive producer.
``It takes a tough look at the role of television in an election.
It addresses the question of a candidate's image on television as
contrasted with reality. Gary Hart gave us a big lesson in that.''
   Sohmer is familiar with television images. At CBS and NBC he was
in charge of promotion. His promotional campaigns at CBS helped
return the network to first place in the ratings in the 1979-80
season.
   Asked about his familiarity with Washington, he said, ``I used
to do marketing research for The Washington Post. I spent a lot of
time in Washington. ... I spent a lot of time staying up late at
night, drinking beer and eating pizza and listening to war stories
from the Washington correspondents. You get a sense of the
manipulation that goes on on both sides.''
   Sohmer describes himself as a ``writer in waiting'' during his
years as a television and movie executive. He was born in Savannah,
Ga., and studied at Yale and Columbia. He was a Doubleday Fellow in
creative writing at Columbia and at the age of 25 had a collection
of short stories published with the title of ``The Way It Was.''
   He's making up for lost time. He has two more books in the
works. One is a complex thriller about the strategic arms
limitations talks and the other is a murder mystery. Both involve
women. ``Women lead more interesting lives,'' said Sohmer, and
``it's tension that drives a thriller. I'm also doing this because
there aren't enough good parts in movies for women.''
   He's also writing a romantic comedy-adventure for Linda Evans
for CBS and another miniseries.
   ``I'm 46,'' said Sohmer. ``At NBC I looked around one day and at
43 I was the oldest guy there. I said I had to have a career where
no one could discriminate against me because of my age. I was
briefly at Columbia Pictures. That persuaded me I didn't want to
work in the movies. That's when I became a writer.''

<HEAD>Battle Of the Economists: Academics Say Buy Long-Term Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of their colleagues on Wall Street call it
crazy, but some Ivy League economists believe they have found an
odds-on way to make money in the bond market.
   The professors say investors should buy long-term bonds when
their yield rises to a big premium over the rates available on
short-term instruments.
   In late May, for example, investors could have locked in a yield
of 9.35 percent on 30-year bonds at a time when three-month
Treasury bills were yielding a meager 6.24 percent.
   It won't work every time, but usually buying in the long end of
the market at times of wide interest-rate differentials will put an
investor well ahead of someone who sticks to the short end of the
market, the professors say.
   ``These are not risk-free strategies, but on average, you do
better going to the higher-yielding instruments,'' N. Gregory
Mankiw, a Harvard University economist, said in an interview this
week.
   Wall Street economists say it's not that simple. They say when
long-term rates are much higher it's because people are expecting
an increase in inflation, which will erode the price of the bonds
and wash out the gains from the higher yields.
   In short, Wall Streeters say the attractive yields on long-term
bonds are only there to make up for the risk of inflation. Let the
buyer beware, they say: The spread could get even wider.
   But people like Harvard's Mankiw, Yale University's Robert
Shiller and Princeton University's John Campbell say the
conventional wisdom has it backwards.
   Most of the time, they say, a big spread between long- and
short-term rates is a signal that long-term rates are going to fall
_ not rise, as the Wall Streeters say.
   When long-term rates fall, prices of bonds go up. That means the
smart investor who bought bonds when the yield spread was big is
doubly blessed by both high yield and capital appreciation.
   From 1961 through 1984, the yield spread between the 30-year
bond and the three-month Treasury bill averaged about 1.2
percentage points, Mankiw has calculated. Spreads tend to narrow if
they get much bigger than that.
   According to Mankiw's calculations, if the spread widens to as
much as 3 percentage points, an investor has a two-thirds chance of
making a profit by taking money out of short-term bills and putting
it in long-term bonds.
   A two-thirds probability isn't a guarantee, but it's better than
most other bets available on the sunny side of the securities laws.
   Even now, Mankiw says, the spread is wide enough _ about 2.3
percentage points _ to justify shifting to long-term bonds.
   Why would such a straightforward strategy have escaped the
notice of sharp-eyed economists on Wall Street? The Wall Streeters
say the strategy is wrong.
   Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. said
history is not a reliable guide to the likely ``normal'' yield
spread between long- and short-term rates.
   Investors are demanding bigger spreads on long-term bonds these
days because they are fearful of inflation, and that fear is likely
to persist, he said.
   ``During the '70s, bond investors were burned and burned again
(by inflation). The steep yield curve tells me that people have
learned something,'' he said.
   Lacy Hunt, chief economist of CM&M Group investment firm, said
anyone who followed the academic theory would have missed ``the
greatest buying opportunity of this decade, and in fact the entire
20th century.''
   That was in late 1981, he said, when long-term rates briefly
fell below short-term rates. The long bond's yield of 15 percent
seemed relatively unattractive at the time, but it proved
astronomical in light of the recession that followed.
   Of course, the academics do not claim the idea will work every
time. Also, Yale's Shiller said it's possible that the ``normal''
spread has risen above its historical average, making it harder to
know when the differential is advantageous.
   Still, it seems as if the yield-spread notion may be an idea
whose time has come. Princeton's Campbell said Wells Fargo
Investment Advisers, for one, has an asset allocation model based
on it.
   If too many people start exploiting the spread, it will snap
shut and the opportunity will be lost, the academics say. For now,
they say, there is money to be made. They have even dabbled around
the edges themselves.
   ``It's always attractive to think that peple on Wall Street are
smart and have figured everything out, but that's not always
true,'' Shiller said.

<HEAD>Vietnam, Land of Travail, Becomes Font Of Saints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam, trampled by colonizers, scourged by an
ugly 20th century war and now ruled by a Communist government, is
getting new attention as a prolific producer of saints.
   Pope John Paul II was scheduled to canonize 117 Vietnamese
martyrs this weekend, apparently making that small country rank
fourth in the world for the number of Catholic saints.
   It has had none up to now, but the national Catholic weekly,
America, reports the large-scale canonizations June 19 will give
Vietnam more saints than all but three other countries.
   They are Italy, Spain and France.
   ``There is an obvious and awesome reason for Vietnam's standing
in this glorious competition,'' writes the Rev. George W. Hunt, the
magazine's editor-in-chief.
   ``In untroubled times, holy people often remain anonymous;
persecution makes them known by making them martyrs.''
   The Catholic Church says it has, in 455 years in Vietnam,
suffered persecution during 240 of those years, with the number of
Christian martyrs in that time estimated at between 130,000 and
300,000.
   Most of the 117 were slain under rule of mandarins, who saw the
Christian gospel as undermining their authority, in the 50 years
before 1883, when Vietnam became a French protectorate.
   Ninety-seven were beheaded or hanged; 11 died by fire or were
cut to pieces, the rest by other violence _ one, a little girl
trampled by a raider's elephant.
   Of the 117, 96 were Vietnamese, 40 of them priests and 56 laity,
l6 of them lay teachers, while the others were 11 Spanish priests
and l0 French priests. They represented all Vietnam before its
temporary modern division, now ended.
   The Rev. Michael Viet-Anh of New Orleans, executive director of
the U.S. national committee for the canonization, said the
ceremonies will be the church's largest, simultaneous making of
saints.
   It is the first time in church history for 117 to be elevated at
one time, he said.
   They were beatified early in this century in successive batches
under previous popes as first steps toward sainthood.
   Viet-Anh said about 2,000 Vietnamese from the United States were
expected to make the pilgrimage to Rome for the occasion, with
probably l0,000 attending from Europe and elsewhere.
   Of Vietnam's 63 million people, most are Buddhist, but there are
about 5 million Catholics led by Archbishop Nguyen Kim Dien of Hue
and other bishops, and about 200,000 Protestants.
   So far, the archbishop, kept under virtual house arrest, has
been refused permission to make the trip to Rome for the
canonization, America reports, and it's unlikely many people in
Vietnam will be allowed to go.
   Most pilgrims were expected to be from among the more than a
million Vietnamese who have fled that country since Saigon fell to
the Communists in 1975, about 200,000 now in the United States.
   Vietnam's Communist authorities have objected to the Vatican
canonization plan, claiming it has anti-communist purposes and
linking the 19th century victims to European imperialism.
   However, the Vietnam government lately has called for an end to
discrimination against Christians, freed dozens of priests from
re-education camps, and allowed opening of Catholic and Protestant
seminaries.
   Many other clergy, however, remain confined in that country
where life often has been hard, as it was for the 117.

   Smaller proportions of people have
preferences for mainline denominations than was the case in the
1960's and mid-1970's, says the Religious Research Center.
   It says a poll of 14,147 adults show these declines in

   Representatives from six Baptist
denominations met here where their faith was founded in America to
celebrate the 350th anniversary of that beginning.
   The Rev. Dwight M. Lundgren, senior minister of the First
Baptist Church where the commemoration and a three-day conference
on religious liberty were held early in June, said:
   ``We want to remind both other Baptists and the general public
that to be Baptist has meant to be free and to safeguard the
freedom of others in their beliefs.''
   The church, considered the first Baptist congregation in
America, was established in 1638 by religious dissenter Roger
Williams, who came to Providence after fleeing religious
persecution in England and Massachusetts.

   The chief executive of the World

preacher Jimmy Swaggart _ but not over the sexual exploits that got
him defrocked.
   The Rev. Emilio Castro, an Uruguayan Methodist minister and the
council's general secretary, speaking at an ecumenical gathering
here in May, had this to say about Swaggart's preaching abroad:
   ``If someone was thinking of giving $10 to Jimmy Swaggart and
asked my opinion, I would say for my country, his ministry is a
disaster.''
   Castro said Swaggart, through his support for the military
government of Chile and apartheid government of South Africa, is
harming the cause of Christ and ``scandalizing Christian people.''

<HEAD>Father of 35 Preaches What He Practices _ Taking in Unwanted
Children</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   He's a bachelor who long ago traded the
solitary life for 15 loads of wash every day, a four-figure grocery
bill every month and enough sons and daughters to fill a classroom
_ 35 in all.
   Meet Kojo Odo. Adoptive father. Tenacious fighter. A man who
takes in children no one else wants: the abused, the abandoned, the
sickly, the scarred. It doesn't matter. Odo finds a place for each
in his heart.
   In his private life, Odo gives unwanted kids a home and hope. In
his public life, he urges others to do the same.
   As Ohio's administrator for special adoptions, Odo works to find
homes for children, especially those hard to place. He needed no
training for this job. His life is his resume.
   In 15 years, Odo has almost single-handedly raised 35 children.
Seven sons now live on their own; the 21 sons and seven daughters
who share his 10-bedroom home range from 6 years old to 22.
   They'll be together Father's Day, but ``it's just another day,''
Odo said. There may be handmade gifts, but the gifts he treasures
most are his children.
   ``The kids are my dreams,'' he said. ``They bring me a level of
satisfaction and achievement. You can take my life ... my money ...
my car. You can burn down my house. You can't take away whatever I
helped my kids achieve.''
   The achievements for some of the children include walking with
crutches after doctors predicted lifetimes in wheelchairs, or
living when they were supposed to die.
   If this seems like a miracle, it isn't _ Odo says love and
stability are all-important. If it sounds inspirational, it is.
   ``If you have the capacity to raise ... and deal with all those
children, you're definitely a credible individual,'' said co-worker
Carol Hector-Harris. ``Someone who lives it as well as works it:
they're believable.''
   Odo says he is proof people needn't be ``mainstream America'' to
adopt a child.
   In a gray flannel world of button-down bureaucrats, Odo, 48,
favors knee-high boots, a knit skull cap and thick, clanging silver
bracelets. Ten golden earrings circle one ear, a gold ring pierces
a nostril and a jeweled stud sits smack dab at the center of his
chin.
   Odo, former civil rights activist and teacher, originally
planned to adopt children once he married. When he was ready,
however, he was still single. And adoption posed many obstacles for
a single, black man.
   After a long investigation, Odo received his first child _ a
7-year-old, one-armed boy. ``He had had seven placements in seven
years,'' he recalled. ``He was emotionally scarred right to the
heart ... but a survivor.''
   Once when Odo hoisted up his son up to a mirror, the boy broke
into tears. Odo thought he was hurting him. Then he found the
problem.
   ``He had always been told he would grow an arm,'' Odo said.
``When he didn't grow an arm, he stopped looking in the mirror.''
   That boy became Odo's pride. ``He grew and made you grow, too,''
he recalled. At 16, he played football and basketball, had
girlfriends and took college entrance exams.
   But in 1982, an assailant stabbed the boy to death in New York
City.``I'm still in mourning for my son,'' Odo said, his eyes
filling with tears. ``Nothing hurt me like that.''
   Yet, he added, ``he made it possible to take some of the
others.''
   Some of Kojo's kids have visible scars. A boy whose legs were
burned when he was dunked in boiling water. A nearly blind
hyperactive child. A boy with deformed ears, a cleft palate,
dislocated hips and a heart murmur. A boy with spina bifida. A girl
with syphilis of the spine.
   Others have emotional scars. One son saw his mother's boyfriend
beat his younger brother to death. ``He was like an animal,'' Odo
said. ``They couldn't put him in a house. They put him in an
institution.''
   His children's abilities vary _ some earn A's and B's at school,
others never finish. Some help with the cooking and watch the
younger children; others are limited to simpler tasks, such as
sweeping floors.
   Odo had reservations as his family grew.
   ``Up to 12 or 15 kids, after every kid, I'd say `No more.' I'd
reach a at where the kid had adjusted. (I'd think) God, there are
so many kids out there. We've gotten the routine down well. I can
take one more.''
   Odo adopts sight unseen. He reviews their records, but says:
``There is no way you can fabricate a meeting without the kid
knowing you're shopping.''
   Some of Odo's children had families unwilling or unable to care
for them _ 11 of the children are siblings from five families.
Others came from institutions.
   Odo never calls his children handicapped. ``I consider labels to
be cages,'' he said. ``If I say `challenged,' the sky's the limit.''
   That attitude motivates.
   ``He was the first man who opened my world,'' said son Konata,
28, a social worker and free-lance artist who lives in New York.
``He was to me the ideal man ... successful, very articulate. ...
He loved people, he loved kids.''
   But Odo's no pushover.
   ``He expects a lot from us,'' said his 17-year-old son,
Kefentse. ``He taught me self-respect. He taught me how to love _
you have to look at the person and see what they need. ... He's
broadened (my) horizons. He's made a future for me.''
   The children share a tradition _ African names beginning with
`k.' Odo composes a list of choices after ``they tell me what they
want their names to say about them or their potential.''
   Kojo's kids live in a rambling, white-frame former retirement
home. Assigned chores are listed on a kitchen wall. The children
rise and go to bed in shifts. Allowance varies according to age.
   Odo is father, mother, teacher and friend. After work, he

<HEAD>Supreme Court Ponders Fine Points of Death Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Having upheld the use of capital punishment
since 1976, the Supreme Court now is considering whether the death
penalty is appropriate for killers who committed their crimes as
juveniles.
   The justices are expected to decide soon whether an Oklahoma
man's death sentence for a murder he committed when he was 15 is a
type of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution.
   The case, along with three other death-penalty disputes the high
court is studying, gives the justices their latest chance to
fine-tune the administration of capital punishment.
   ``It is hard to find a broad-based constitutional challenge to
the death penalty today,'' said Henry Schwarzchild of the
pro-abolition American Civil Liberties Union's capital punishment
project. ``I'm not aware of any in the works that are national in
scope.''
   He added: ``The Supreme Court isn't going to make any major
changes in the administration of capital punishment until the
American culture wants major changes, and right now the culture is
in an extraordinarily macho mood.''
   The number of prisoners executed since the Supreme Court's
ruling in 1976 that allowed states to resume capital punishment
reached 100 last week, with the death of convicted murder Edward R.
Byrne in Louisiana on Tuesday.
   Leigh Dingerson of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty is one of those closely following the Oklahoma case.
   ``The court has the opportunity to bring us out of the depths of
being among the few countries that execute kids,'' she said.
   Oklahoma Assistant Attorney General David W. Lee told the
justices, however, that ``chronological age is an inherently poor
criterion'' for determining which convicted killers should be
executed.
   How the court decides the fate of William Wayne Thompson, now
21, will affect only 30 of the more than 2,100 death row inmates
nationwide, but the case of Thompson vs. Oklahoma nevertheless has
captured worldwide attention.
   Three other death penalty issues are expected to be decided by
the high court by July:
   _In Ross vs. Oklahoma, the convicted killer of an Oklahoma
policeman is arguing that he is entitled to a new trial because his
was tainted by a jury-selection error.
   During jury selection at Bobby Lynn Ross' trial, a potential
juror said he would vote to impose the death penalty _ and would
not even consider a life sentence _ if Ross were convicted.
   The judge refused to diqualify the person ``for cause,'' and
Ross' lawyer used one of nine ``peremptory challenges'' to oust the
potential juror. Ross says the judge's error tainted the jury's
make-up in a way that made a fair trial impossible.
   _A case that could affect a significant number of the some 260
death row inmates in Texas is Franklin vs. Lynaugh.
   Convicted killer Donald Gene Franklin argues that Texas' capital
punishment law, as interpreted by the state's courts, stacks the
deck in favor of death over life in prison.
   Texas courts say judges are not required to tell jurors about
the relevance or importance of mitigating evidence, that which
points to life in prison rather than death as the punishment.
   Franklin wanted his jury to be told it must consider his
character, prison record and capacity for rehabilitation when
assessing his future dangerousness.
   _In Johnson vs. Mississippi, Samuel Bice Johnson's sentencing
jury was told about his 1963 conviction for assault in New York.
The prior conviction was considered an aggravating circumstance but
that conviction subsequently was set aside by New York courts.
   Mississippi's courts, however, refused to conduct a new
sentencing trial for Johnson.
   The justices already have ruled in five death penalty cases
during their current term, none of which is expected to carry much
impact beyond the respective states involved.

Holdout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New Yorkers, who introduced the electric
chair to the world nearly a century ago, only talk about the death
penalty these days.
   A 12-year struggle between a Legislature which believes in the
death penalty and two governors who don't has prevented New York
from adding to the list of 695 convicts it executed between 1890,
when William Kemmler became the first person to die in the electric
chair, and 1963, when Willie Lee Mays was the last to die in the
state.
   Because of the opposition of Govs. Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo,
both Democrats, New York is the largest of the 13 states that
haven't enacted capital punishment statutes since 1976.
   Every year since 1977, the Legislature has annually approved
bills to restore the death penalty. Carey vetoed the measures the
last six years he was in office and Cuomo has done the same for the
first six years of his tenure.
   The Legislature never has been able to muster the two-thirds
majority needed to override those vetoes, though it has come close.
   ``Whenever you get exasperated if you're unable to find a
solution to these terrible, terrible problems you go to the death
penalty,'' Cuomo said Tuesday, just hours after Louisiana conducted
the 100th execution since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1976
that restored capital punishment.
   ``It sums up your rage and indignation. I understand that,''
Cuomo said. ``It doesn't work. It never did. Not only doesn't it
make things better, I suspect it makes them worse.''
   Arguing against the supposed deterrent effect of executions,
Cuomo noted that nine states have higher murder rates than does New
York, and eight have restored capital punishment.
   The refusal of the two New York governors to sign death penalty
legislation is important symbolically, says Henry Schwarzchild of
the anti-capital punishment American Civil Liberties Union.
   Though polls conducted by legislators routinely show more than
70 percent of New York residents favor restoring the death penalty,
New Yorkers overwhelmingly elected Carey in 1978, gave Cuomo a slim
victory in 1982 and a record-setting re-election in 1986. The two
Democrats each time defeated Republicans who supported the death
penalty.
   Voters respect governors who take a moral stand on the death
penalty, Schwarzchild said.
   ``In other words, it is not the single fatal noose that
political leaders put their heads in, though a great many of them
claim that that's the reason they follow the popular call for it,''
he said.
   The state Senate's chief death penalty advocate, Republican Dale
Volker, says New York's inability to restore the death penalty is
sending another message nationwide.
   ``It's an embarrassment in some ways,'' said Volker, a former
police officer from the Buffalo area. ``When New York overrides the
death penalty it will send reverberations not only in our state but
across the country. We must send a signal to the streets.''
   Volker predicted the New York Legislature may get enough votes
to override a Cuomo veto within two or three years. Most capital
punishment advocates concede Cuomo's veto will stand again this
year.
   The latest death penalty bill would apply to the murder of
on-duty police officers or prison guards, murder-for-hire cases and
murders committed along with other violent felonies such as rape or
kidnapping.
   According to Donald Savage, an aide to Volker, about 500 murders
in New York each year _ one-fourth of the total _ fall within those
categories.
   While pro-death penalty legislators blast Cuomo, he assails them
over their refusal to approve his legislation to provide New York
judges with a life-without-parole sentence for some murderers.
   Volker said such a sentence would be an economic strain and
create a class of inmates who'd be impossible to control because
they have nothing to lose.
   In the meantime, the battle continues over whether the death
penalty reduces murders. Cuomo called it the ``statistical game.''
Several New York legislators say they have listened to a decade of
debates and still have no idea whether capital punishment deters
potential murderers.
   Volker argues that crime statistics show that not having the
death penalty hurts. New York's murder rate in 1963, the year of
its last execution, was 4.2 per 100,000 population, or lower than
the national average that year of 4.6.
   In 1986, New York's murder rate was nearly 11 per 100,000 or
about 25 percent higher than the national average of 8.6 as
reported by the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Section. More than
41,000 people have been murdered in New York since 1963, according
to the state's Division of Criminal Justice Services.
   ``I can't believe there's anybody in the state, even the
opponents of the death penalty, who would say that life is safer
today since the death penalty was abolished,'' Volker said. ``We've
tried just about everything and nothing has worked very well.''

<HEAD>Inmate Has Lonely Existence Awaiting Death Appeal In Connecticut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOMERS, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Death Row in Connecticut is just one
prisoner, separated by a cinderblock wall from an inoperable
electric chair.
   The chair known as ``Old Sparky'' hasn't worked since 1960, when
it was in another prison, and state officials aren't sure the
electrical system in Somers State Prison is up to delivering the
2,000-volt shock.
   ``If the wheels grind through, the state will do what it has to
do,'' said Lt. James Burke, a correction officer at Somers.
   Michael B. Ross, who was convicted of raping and murdering six
young women, may be years away from an execution date.
   Last summer, Ross became the first and still the only person
sentenced to die under Connecticut's 1980 law, which rules out the
death penalty if there is any mitigating factor such as emotional
distress. Jurors must also find an aggravating factor, such as a a
particularly heinous crime.
   The law prescribes an automatic appeal, a process which state
officials say could take as long as eight years.
   Connecticut is one of 37 states that have death penalty laws,
one of 34 in which a prisoner is under sentence, and the only state
with a single condemned prisoner.
   The state's electric chair, which was installed in the
maximum-security prison in Wethersfield in 1937, was used in 18
executions. The last was Joseph ``Mad Dog'' Taborsky, who was put
to death May 17, 1960 after being convicted of six murders. The
Wethersfield prison has since been demolished.
   Correction Department spokeswoman Connie Wilks said it has been
estimated that it would cost at least $10,000 to hook up the chair
at Somers.
   The state doesn't have an executioner and would be required to
find a master electrician if a prisoner should be put to death,
Burke added.
   Ross, 29, lives next to the chair, in a 6-by-10 foot cell that
was designed as the final holding area for inmates on their way to
the death chamber.
   He was arrested in 1984 on charges he killed six women between
ages 14 to 23. He pleaded no contest to two of the murders in June
1985 and was sentenced to 120 years in prison.
   Last year, he was convicted of kidnapping, raping and strangling
two women aged 17 and 19, and of kidnapping and murdering two
14-year-olds.
   Testimony by friends, family and psychiatric experts portrayed
him as a sick man whose drive to rape and kill was rooted in a
tormented childhood, but the jury rejected that as a mitigating
factor.
   A gangly six-footer with wire-rim glasses, Ross spends his time
writing and reading. The Cornell University graduate is separated
from other inmates by a wall, but he can hear their banter through
a doorway that is usually kept open. Ross has a string tied to the
knob so that he can close the metal door when he wants quiet.
   Outside the door are seven other cells designed as death row but
now used as a segregation unit for unruly or dangerous inmates.
   ``I understand why I'm being held in the death cell, the theory
being, why empty out death row and lose seven cells for one inmate,
especially with the sytem overcrowding at present?'' Ross said in a
letter responding to questions from The Associated Press.
``However, while I understand it, I'm not sure it is the correct
action to take.''
   A camera outside his cell monitors Ross continuously.
   ``Even though the camera is always there and always watching, it
is less obtrusive than a guard and can for the most part be
ignored,'' Ross wrote. ``However, it does occasionally get lonely
down here and I do have more trouble getting those things that I'm
entitled to.''
   He said he would like a desk, shelves and a window in his cell.
   He is allowed one visit per week, plus one other visit every
other weekend.
   Some prosecutors have complained that Connecticut law makes the
death penalty too difficult to impose, because it is nullified by
any mitigating circumstance.
   The sharp division on death penalty laws was apparent last year
when the state House narrowly voted down a bill to abolish the
death penalty, then approved another which would make capital
punishment easier to impose. That bill died in the Senate.
   This year, capital punishment was not a significant issue in the
Legislature.
   A poll last year of 500 adult residents of Connecticut found
that 69 percent supported the death penalty, although a majority
expressed a preference for lethal injection rather than
electrocution.
   Diane Randall of the Connecticut Network Against the Death
Penalty said the Ross case is a tough one for death penalty
opponents. There is no question of guilt, and there is no question
of racial bias _ both killer and victims were white.
   ``Those kinds of cases _ mass murderers, or horrendous things
like that _ are hard to combat,'' she said.
   ``One of the things we have talked about is how can we be
sensitive to people who have suffered, and yet say that the
response to that pain is not to inflict more inhumanity?''

<HEAD>PRESIDENT REAGAN, United States</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan, the first actor and the oldest person to serve as
president of the United States, has sought to reverse the trend
toward increased government participation in the economy that dates
back to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs.
   In foreign affairs, Reagan began his presidency by denouncing
the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire'' and ended by applauding the
reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He and Gorbachev,
meeting in Washington last December, signed the first treaty
eliminating an entire class of superpower nuclear weapons.
   Despite his enormous popularity, Reagan's second administration
was clouded by the Iran-Contra affair. Former national security
aides John Poindexter and Oliver North and two businessmen were
indicted on charges in connection with the arms sales to Iran and
the diversion of profits to the Contra rebels fighting in Nicaragua.
   Reagan, 77, got his start as a radio sportscaster in Iowa, but
had strived since high school to be an actor. When he went to
California to cover Chicago Cubs spring training in 1937, a
Hollywood friend got him a screen test.
   He made 56 films, but his career faltered after World War II.
   Reagan was a Democrat in his movie days, but supported moderate
Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956. He switched
parties in 1962 and was elected governor of California as a
Republican in 1966, serving two terms.
   He made unsuccessful bids for the GOP presidential nomination in
1968 and 1976, but captured it in 1980, going on to twice win the
White House by a landslide.

<HEAD>PRIME MINISTER BRIAN MULRONEY, Canada</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mulroney, nearing the end of a stormy first term, hopes to cash
in on a statesmanlike performance as host of the economic summit.
   The 49-year-old former lawyer and mining company executive has
hosted two other summits in the past year: a meeting of
French-speaking nations in Quebec last September and the
Commonwealth summit in Vancouver last October.
   Plagued by Cabinet scandals and low personal ratings in the
polls, Mulroney has to call the next election by the summer of 1989
but could do so as early as this fall if the popularity of his
Progressive Conservative government improves.
   A Quebec native fluent in French despite his Irish heritage,
Mulroney led his party to a landslide win in September 1984, taking
the largest number of seats in Canadian history.
   His government set conservative fiscal targets, reducing the
budget deficit and denationalizing state corporations. Under
political pressure, he has relaxed the purse strings to subsidize
farmers and poorer regions of the country.
   Priorities in Mulroney's five-year term have included better
relations with the United States. He and President Reagan signed a
Free Trade Agreement which, if ratified, would eliminate all
tariffs in the world's largest trading partnership. However, he
failed to persuade Reagan to curb acid rain emissions from Midwest
power plants.

<HEAD>PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER, Britain</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Thatcher, the longest serving leader in the Western
alliance, has hinted she will ``go on and on'' into the 1990s,
pursuing her goal of transforming Britain with her capitalist
revolution.
   A Conservative, she was first elected in 1979 as the left-right
consensus of the 1960s collapsed amid labor strikes and economic
decline. She is widely regarded as Britain's most conservative
post-war leader.
   She has denationalized vast chunks of state-owned industry and
has clamped down on the unions. Her latest budget cut the basic
income tax rate by two points to 25 percent and slashed the top
rate by one-third to 40 percent. She has begun to crack down on
welfare payments, realigning the system to benefit the low-paid
rather than the jobless.
   Unemployment hit a record 13 percent in Thatcher years and
statistics show a widening gap between rich and poor. But there are
signs that her economic policies are working _ a budget surplus,
unemployment down to 8.8 percent and falling steadily, and a strong
pound.
   Despite criticism that she has become increasingly authoritarian
and lacks compassion, the Conservatives' poll rating is
undiminished at around 43 percent, four points above the main
opposition Labor Party.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 62, has good relations with both superpowers, and
has made Britain's special relationship with the United States the
cornerstone of her foreign policy.
   The Soviets once called her ``The Iron Lady,'' and she relishes
the title. ``I am not a consensus politician,'' she has said. ``I
am a conviction politician.''

<HEAD>PRESIDENT FRANCOIS MITTERRAND, France</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mitterrand, re-elected last month to his second seven-year term
as president, has been a major figure in French politics since the
end of World War II.
   Mitterrand, 71, was elected May 10, 1981, in a Socialist
landslide that first carried him over incumbent center-right
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. The Socialists gained a
majority in the National Assembly a month later.
   In his first two years in office, Mitterrand implemented some
long-held socialist ideas, described as a ``rupture with
capitalism.''
   But the wholesale nationalizations, the decrees raising wages
and reducing working hours and other steps were an economic
disaster, and Mitterrand was forced to reverse course and institute
austerity.
   His popularity slumped, but rebounded after a center-right
coalition won control of the National Assembly in March 1986.
   For two years, Mitterrand shared power with conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac. The president remained mostly above the day-to-day
political battles, occasionally noting his disagreement with
Chirac's policies, and he gradually rebounded in opinion polls.
   In the runoff election last May 8, Mitterrand got 54 percent of
the vote to defeat Chirac.
   Mitterrand's foreign policy stands have changed less than his
domestic programs. He favors greater action to aid Third World
development and believes conventional weapons, rather than nuclear
forces, should be the next focus of disarmament talks.
   Mitterrand escaped from a German prisoner of war camp during
World War II, returned to France and created a resistance network _
which he refused to link to Gen. Charles de Gaulle's group.
   During the chaotic post-war Fourth Republic, Mitterrand held 11
Cabinet posts. In the early 1970s, he took the moribund Socialist
Party and built it up until it overtook the Communists as the major
force in the French left.
   Mitterrand has run for president four times, losing in 1965 and
1974 before his victories in 1981 and 1988.

<HEAD>PREMIER CIRIACO DE MITA, Italy</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   De Mita, who is determined to bring Italy's byzantine political
system closer to the style of other Western democracies, was chosen
in April to lead Italy's 48th post-war government.
   The 60-year-old veteran of Italy's volatile political scene has
led the dominant Christian Democrats since 1982, a post widely
considered the most powerful in Italy.
   When he became premier, De Mita demanded that the party allow
him to remain leader of the Christian Demcorats _ something no
premier had done for 29 years. He argued that it would give him the
authority to govern effectively and the Christian Democrats agreed,
though a leadership fight is expected within a year.
   The always nattily dressed son of a tailor, De Mita was born in
Nusco, a poor mountain village east of Naples. He studied law at
the Catholic University in Milan, joined the Christian Democrats in
the 1950s and was first elected to Parliament in 1963 at age 35.
   Known as an ideas man, he served as minister of industry,
minister of foreign trade, and minister to oversee development of
southern Italy, before becoming party leader.
   De Mita was in a key position when factional fighting within the
Christian Democrats, the country's largest vote-getting party,
undermined the government of Premier Giovanni Goria, who resigned
for the third and final time March 11.
   De Mita's commitment to streamline Italy's cumbersome
bureaucracy and legislative process remains undeterred, despite the
murder of one of his closest advisers on reform, Sen. Roberto
Ruffilli, in April. The leftist terrorist Red Brigades claimed
responsibility.
   On international issues, De Mita favors reductions in nuclear
and conventional arms, but opposes any move that would weaken
Western security.

<HEAD>PRIME MINISTER NOBORU TAKESHITA, Japan</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Takeshita, 64, took over the as premier and leader of the ruling
party on Nov. 6, after being handpicked by his predecessor,
Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   A martial arts expert and former Kamikaze pilot, Takeshita is
well-known for his ability to work behind the scenes for a
compromise.
   Takeshita is the son of a sake brewer and taught junior high
school English before his election to the Shimane Prefecture
assembly in 1951. He was elected to the House of Representatives
seven years later.
   He served as parliamentary vice minister for trade and industry
in 1963 and 1964, and was named chief Cabinet secretary under
Eisaku Sato in 1971. In 1976, he was appointed construction
minister and later became finance minister, a post to which he was
reappointed five times.
   In September 1985, Takeshita represented Japan at the meeting of
five industrial nations in which action was taken to reduce the
value of the yen. Since that meeting, the yen has soared some 70
percent against the dollar, forcing Japan to alter its export-led
economy.
   During his terms as finance minister, Takeshita steadfastly
carried out Nakasone's program of fiscal reform and oversaw the
liberalization of the nation's capital and financial markets.

<HEAD>CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL, West Germany</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Kohl, 58, took office in 1982 with the reputation as an
unexciting but dependable former state governor who had limited
experience in international affairs.
   Kohl's coalition government has pledged to stimulate the
nation's economy, but critics, including members of the U.S.
Congress, have charged that West Germany is not doing enough to
fire up its economy.
   Kohl, a staunch Roman Catholic, was born in Ludwigshafen, an
industrial city in a wine-growing region of the Rhine River in
southwest West Germany. His father was a low-level revenue official
and his mother a teacher.
   He graduated from Heidelberg University with a doctorate in
political science in 1958, and has spent his entire adult life in
politics.
   He has been leader of West Germany's Christian Democrat party
since the early 1970s, made an unsuccessful bid for the
chancellorship in 1976 and was a minority leader in Parliament
until 1982.
   Kohl has good personal relations with Reagan, with whom he
shares many conservative views.
   He has sought to normalize relations with Communist East
Germany, but always in the context of improved East-West ties.
   He stirred an international controversy when he invited Reagan
in May 1985 to visit Bitburg, a World War II cemetery which
included the graves of 49 Nazi SS soldiers.
   Jewish leaders worldwide denounced the move.
   Kohl defended the invitation _ which Reagan accepted _ as a
``demonstrative gesture of reconciliation'' 40 years after the
defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.

   The name masks the purpose: American Engineering
Co. Inc. is in the business of death.
   Lethal injection machines, electric chairs, gallows and gas
chambers form the catalog of equipment designed and built by the
company owned by a Boston entrepreneur, his wife and an engineer.
   American Engineering is believed to be the only company in the
United States that makes nothing but execution equipment. Four
years ago, it designed and built the first computer-controlled
machine to regulate the flow of drugs in a lethal injection.
   Five states have bought the $30,000 device, company President
Norbert C. Lynch said.
   ``This is the most humane way we know of today to carry out
lethal injection,'' Lynch said. ``If they're going to carry it out,
they should do it in the most humane possible way.''
   However, none of American Engineering's equipment has been used
in any of the 100 executions in the United States since 1976.
   Lynch runs American Engineering and a financial consulting firm
from a storefront in the city's Charlestown neighborhood, down the
block from the Bunker Hill Monument.
   In 1983, Lynch said, an engineer friend heard a disc jockey
mocking New Jersey because it advertised for executioners. The idea
was planted: how to automate lethal injection.
   ``The methodology that's used in the lethal injection on a
manual system is barbaric,'' Lynch said.
   The basic complications in lethal injection, Lynch said, are
ruptured veins, inaccurate dosages and failure to immediately
induce unconsciousness.
   Of the 37 states which have capital punishment, 16 prescribe
death by lethal injection.
   Delaware contracted for a lethal injection machine last year
after the state changed its method of execution from hanging, said
H. Brooke Laggner, chief of administration and operational support
for the state's Department of Correction.
   ``It takes away the element that you don't have any Hippocratic
oath problems because all you need is someone to set up an i.v.,''
Laggner said, referring to the potential conflict of using medical
skills to cause death.
   Delaware, which has six prisoners under death sentence but has
had no executions since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling, paid $60,000
for the injection equipment and an execution trailer also designed
by American Engineering.
   Death penalty opponents bristle at American Engineering's
business, saying there is no ethical justification in making
executions easier or more efficient.
   ``The worst sin of all is to do that well which shouldn't be
done at all,'' said Henry Schwarzschild, director of the American
Civil Liberties Union's capital punishment project. ``The notion
that a homicide becomes nicer if you do it nicely is morally
outrageous.''
   The injection machine, a 3-by-4-foot gray box with a row of
switches and red lights, is mounted to the wall above the inmate's
gurney. Five to 6 feet of intravenous tubing inserted by a medical
technician into the inmate's right arm run through the wall to a
computerized control module.
   Two executioners each push a button to start the machine;
neither knows who actually activates the pistons that inject 10 to
15 cubic centimeters of drugs.
   A dosage of sodium pentathol renders the inmate unconscious. The
second drug is pancuronium bromide, or Pavulon, which in large
doses paralyzes body functions. The third, potassium chloride,
stops the heart.
   The execution should take four to six minutes, Lynch said, ``as
opposed to 25 minutes to a half an hour.''
   ``The prisoner is going to be sedated first. While he is under
we are going to cause respiratory arrest, leading to brain death,''
he said. ``Is he going to feel it? No. He's going to go out and
that's the end of it. Over and out.''
   American Engineering has assets of about $100,000 and the market
for its wares is limited, but Lynch feels the condition of the
nation's execution devices and the lack of competition could mean
more contracts.
   For states that don't use lethal injection, American Engineering
also designs electric chairs, gas chambers and gallows.
   Lynch said he has sold three electric helmets at $5,000 apiece
and three sets of leg stocks at $2,000 each, and redesigned one
gallows for $15,000. Citing the confidentiality of his clients,
Lynch refused to identify the states does business with.
   Gas chambers inspected by the company would leak if used, Lynch
claimed. American Engineering is rebuilding one at a cost of
$200,000. The company also has repaired four electric chairs and
condemned two others, but he said the states refused to renovate or
replace the devices.
   Lynch said he opposes capital punishment, but adds: ``If it's
going to be done it should be done right.''
   ``If we're going to hang this person then we should be using the
proper rope,'' Lynch said. ``And you can't blame the rope-maker for
the hanging.''

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $9.89 billion
in April, its best showing in more than three years, the government
has reported.
   The April deficit narrowed by 15.5 percent from a seasonally
adjusted March deficit figure of $11.70 billion, with all of the
improvement coming from a steep drop in imports, the Commerce
Department said Tuesday.
   Investors scooped up U.S. securities and dollars in response to
the surprise plunge, which diluted inflation fears, depressed
interest rates and sent the stock market to a post-crash high.

a national disaster, according to Agriculture Secretary Richard E.
Lyng.
   ``I guess the best thing for us to do is pray for rain,'' Lyng
told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Tuesday. But he said USDA
already was providing drought aid, and he agreed with lawmakers
that congressional action may be necessary.
   Lyng also told the panel, which is considering legislation to

   OPEC members have agreed to a six-month
extension of their existing production accord, but the long-term
outlook for the fractious cartel remained cloudy as its midyear
conference adjourned.
   Even though it expects oil demand to grow, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries decided not to raise its production
as a conciliatory gesture to independent producers, said OPEC

   Tuesday's bipartisan compromise, which is given virtually no
chance of passing Congress this year, would establish uniform
federal liability standards for lawsuits over defective consumer

industry's federal antitrust exemption.
   The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed in 1945, grants the antitrust
exemption. A number of states have filed suit claiming that dozens
of insurance companies, under the guise of the exemption, conspired
to create the liability insurance crisis of 1985-86. Insurance
during that time period became unavailable or too costly for many

might mean for the impending proxy showdown between the oil giant
and financier Carl C. Icahn.
   The New York Stock Exchange reported Tuesday that 7,696,300
shares, representing 3.2 percent of Texaco's 243 million shares
outstanding, sold at $50.25 per share.
   Some analysts said the buyer may have been Icahn, who has
offered to buy the Texaco shares he does not already own for $60 a
share. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., an investment firm known to
have held a 4.9 percent stake in Texaco, was seen as a likely
seller.

   Market relief that the latest OPEC meeting ended
without producing a price war has sent oil futures rebounding
following three days of losses.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, rose 40 cents
Tuesday to settle at $16.83 per barrel. The contract had dropped 90
cents over the preceding three sessions, amid skepticism that the
cartel would take any substantial steps to help boost prices.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
rose 1.02 cents a gallon to 49.53 cents and home heating oil
declined rose 0.57 cent to close at 44.32 cents a gallon.
   Members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries ended their meeting in Vienna, Austria after agreeing to
extend their existing production accord for six months.
   Traders who sensed animosity among the various factions within
OPEC were relieved when the gathering concluded, said Richard
Redoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   ``The people were very, very nervous that these guys would come
out with a full-blown price war,'' Redoglia said. ``When that
(animosity) abated, then the market was able to rally.''
   OPEC's inability to come up with a new production agreement had
been digested by the market on Monday, analysts said.
   The cartel has been divided into two main camps. The majority,
led by Venezuela, wanted to cut production to boost prices closer
to the target level. A minority, led by powerful Saudi Arabia,
OPEC's largest producer, wanted to increase production to take
advantage of a expected increase in demand during the rest of the
year and to maintain market share.
   The agreement extended Tuesday calls for production quotas for
the 12 OPEC members other than Iraq totaling 15.06 million barrels
a day.
   Iraq has refused to sign the accord because it wants a quota
equal to Iran's. The two countries have been at war since 1980.
   Current OPEC production is estimated at 18.5 million barrels a
day.

   Both parties in the sale of a huge block of
Texaco Inc. shares remain unidentified, as the proxy fight between
Texaco and Carl C. Icahn, its largest shareholder, moves closer to
a showdown.
   The sale late Tuesday morning consisted of 7,696,300 shares,
representing 3.2 percent of Texaco's 243 million outstanding
shares, at $50.25 per share, according to New York Stock Exchange
officials.
   Speculation was rife among market-watchers that the investment
firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. _ known to have had a 4.9
percent stake in the company _ probably did the selling, with Icahn
or allied parties as the likely buyer or buyers.
   Icahn's last report to the government said he held 14.8 percent
of Texaco's stock.
   Last month, he offered to pay $60 per share for the outstanding
Texaco shares he does not already own. After Texaco rejected that
offer, he began campaigning with four allies for seats on Texaco's
14-member board, in order to pressure the company into putting his
buyout offer to a shareholder vote.
   The board election will conclude with the end of Texaco's annual
meeting Friday in Tulsa, Okla.
   Texaco was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock
Exchange, closing down 12{ cents at $50.37{ a share.
   Wall Street has shown skepticism about Icahn's ability to
finance a takeover bid, keeping the price of Texaco stock well
below his $60 offer.
   That led some analysts to speculate Kohlberg Kravis was the
seller.
   Michael Young, an oil analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., took that view, and said he believed Icahn was the other party.
   ``If it was KKR, it went into someone else's hands just as tight
and just as aggressive. That sounds like only one person to me _
but we'll have to wait until Icahn files with the SEC to find
out,'' said Young.
   Young was referring to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule
that a shareholder who acquires more than 5 percent of a company's
stock must report all subsequent transactions in the company's
stock.
   He also noted that Texaco's share price remained unchanged after
its volume had surpassed 12 million shares _ a sign that ``whoever
they sold it to, it did not go into loose hands.''
   There has been much speculation on Wall Street over whether
Kohlberg Kravis, a highly successful leveraged buyout firm,
intended to bid for Texaco.
   Icahn said Monday that one of the firm's partners, Henry Kravis,
had told him it might make a bid if Icahn's offer was put before
Texaco's shareholders. Giving a deposition for a lawsuit, Icahn
quoted Kravis as saying he ``might be willing to pay more'' than
$60 a share, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times said.
   Tom Daly, a spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis, said the firm had no
comment on the matter. A woman at Icahn's office said he had no
comment.
   Lois Johnston, a spokeswoman at Texaco's headquarters in White
Plains, N.Y., said the company had a policy of not commenting on
market activity.

   Oil prices jumped higher following OPEC's
decision to extend its current output ceiling, but experts say the
cartel's failure to resolve key production disagreements makes it
unclear whether the buoyant effect will last.
   ``You can almost toss a coin as to what this will mean for the
market,'' said Paul McDonald, an independent, London-based oil
consultant.
   The deeply-divided Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
as expected announced Tuesday it would extend through the end of
this year its accord to limit daily output to 15.06 million
barrels, even though it expects oil demand to grow.
   The limit is intended to control supplies and help push oil
prices to the cartel's target price of $18 a barrel.
   OPEC actually produces 18.5 million barrels daily, partly
because of cheating by individual nations and partly because the
ceiling, which the cartel last December had extended through June
30, excludes Iraq.
   Iraq refuses to sign the accord because it wants a quota
equalling that of Iran, its war enemy since 1980.
   News of the extension, reached at the cartel's regular mid-year
meeting, immediately buoyed the oil markets.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude oil, rose 40 cents to close at $16.83 a barrel Tuesday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract had dropped 90 cents over the preceding three
sessions, amid skepticism that the cartel would take any
substantial steps to help boost prices and jitters of a potential
price war.
   But analysts were divided about what the meeting's outcome would
mean for oil prices in coming months.
   Paul Mlotok, an oil analyst with the New York investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc., said the meeting ``came out pretty much as
you would have expected.''
   Philip Morgan, an oil analyst with the London investment firm
Warburg Securties, said, ``The factions were just too divided to
come to any conclusion other than this.''
   Both analysts indicated many market watchers were relieved that
the cartel was able simply to agree on the extension, given its
internal frictions.
   ``There was the possibility for serious trouble,'' Mlotok said.
   OPEC has split into two key factions, with the majority, led by
Venezuela, pressing to cut production to boost prices closer to the
target level.
   A minority, led by powerful Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest
producer, has wanted to increase production to take advantage of an
expected increase in demand during the rest of the year and to
maintain market share.
   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister who serves as cartel
president, said at the meeting's conclusion that the expected
increase in demand made OPEC optimistic that oil prices would
increase to $18 a barrel by year's end.
   Citing that anticipated demand increase, Mlotok and Morgan said
they expected oil prices to hold in a range of $16 a barrel to $18
a barrel over the next few months.
   McDonald said the output pact extension ``will keep them limping
along at $15 a barrel until the next meeting,'' which the ministers
scheduled for Nov. 21.
   But John Toalster, an oil analyst with the London investment
firm Hoare Govett Ltd., said the meeting's outcome was ``kind of a
fudged issue'' because there had been no commitment to cut
production.
   Saudi Arabia views the target price as a ceiling and sees $14 a
barrel as a floor price, Toalster said.
   Those factors, plus the cartel's overproduction during a period
of high oil stock levels, will depress prices to below $14 a barrel
in the near term, Toalster speculated.
   ``It really will be a testing time in the next few weeks,''
Toalster said.
   OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Early June Domestic Car, Truck Sales Down 4.1 Percent From Year
Ago</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early June brought a slight lull in domestic car
and light trucks sales, which declined 4.1 percent from a year ago,
but industry analysts said the dip stemmed from one-time rather
than economic factors.
   ``There's no reason to think that underlying demand just for
these 10 days has gotten slower,'' Kathleen Heaney, analyst with
Nikko Securities International in New York, said Tuesday.
   ``Nothing's different in the economy for consumers all of a
sudden.''
   Domestic car sales in the nine selling days from June 1 to June
10 were down 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier and
domestic light truck sales were down 2.7 percent.
   The eight companies that build passenger vehicles in the United
States sold 198,647 domestic cars and 112,945 domestic light trucks
in early June, down from 208,699 cars and 116,000 trucks a year
earlier.
   Industry analysts said sales were higher in early June 1987
because a new round of buyer incentives had just been launched.
They noted that 1988 spring sales have held steady and consumer
confidence remains strong.
   Car sales were down during the period for all domestic makers
except Toyota Motor Corp., which was just beginning U.S. production
last year, and Mazda Motor Corp., which began U.S. production last
September.
   ``The last 10 days of May were very strong and may have borrowed
some sales that normally would have occurred in the first 10 days
of June,'' said Michael Luckey, president of Luckey Consulting
Group in Cresskill, N.J.
   Luckey predicted sales will be higher during the rest of the
month. ``The consumer remains in a buying mood,'' he said.
   General Motors Corp. sold 6.2 percent fewer domestic cars and
4.5 percent fewer domestic light trucks than in early June 1987.
GM's combined car and light truck sales were down 5.7 percent from
a year earlier.
   Ford Motor Co.'s domestic cars sales were down 3.2 percent and
its domestic light truck sales lagged 6.9 percent behind
year-earlier sales. Ford's combined domestic car and light truck
sales were down 4.7 percent from a year earlier.
   Chrysler Corp.'s domestic car sales fell 6.4 percent but its
domestic truck sales, which include the hot-selling Jeep lineup,
rose 2 percent from early June 1987. Chrysler's combined domestic
sales were down 2.5 percent from a year earlier.
   GM, the industry leader, held 45.6 percent of the combined
domestic market, slightly less than its 46.8 percent share a year
ago. Ford's share held nearly steady at 31.2 percent, while
Chrysler's rose to 17.5 percent from 16.3 percent a year ago.
   Honda Motor Co.'s domestic car sales fell 0.3 percent,
Volkswagen of America's sales were down 8 percent and Nissan Motor
Co.'s sales fell 27.6 percent from early June 1987.
   Nissan's sales of domestically built trucks jumped 83.8 percent,
reflecting the company's decision earlier this year to build more
trucks than cars at its assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn.

<TEXT>
   U.S. steel trade quotas restricted April
imports of finished steel products to 1.33 million tons, or 15.7
percent of the market, well below the plan's 18.5 percent goal,
according to importers.
   Imports during the first four months of 1988, not counting
semi-finished steel bound for U.S. mills, represented 17.5 percent
of the domestic market, importers said Tuesday.
   ``U.S. rolling mills have urgently needed semi-finished imports
since early 1988,'' said Erwin L. Klein, president of the American
Institute for Imported Steel.
   Klein, who also is vice chairman of Steelinter Inc., a New
York-based importer, said American steelmakers more frequently are
citing domestic shortages in seeking Commerce Department permission
to exceed quotas for imported semi-finished steel.
   ``Semi-finished imports even now cannot meet demand,'' Klein
said.
   April's semi-finished imports were 198,119 tons, or 12.9 percent
of all steel imports, the AIIS said, citing Commerce Department
statistics.
   Klein said the situation should be considered in the debate over
extending the quotas, which are scheduled to expire in September
1989.

<HEAD>Label Was Enough Warning For Smoker, Appeals Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The warning labels on cigarette packages
provide enough information to educate people about the dangers of
smoking, a federal appeals court has ruled in rejecting a Tennessee
couple's $107 million claim against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
   Tuesday's ruling by a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision against the claims
brought by Floyd F. Roysdon and his wife, Ruth Ann, of Oneida, Tenn.
   The Roysdons had sued R.J. Reynolds on the grounds that the
company's Camel and Winston brands of cigarettes were dangerous.
Roysdon said he became addicted to smoking and that addiction
caused the vascular disease which resulted in amputation of his
left leg below the knee almost five years ago.
   Roysdon, 55, accused the cigarette maker of failing to warn him
of the risk of vascular disease and of selling cigarettes that were
defective and dangerous. He said he began smoking Camels in 1946 at
age 13, later switched to Winstons, and was unable to quit smoking
despite repeated attempts to do so.
   The appeals court panel unanimously upheld a lower court's
conclusion that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act,
which was enacted in 1965 to require warning labels on cigarettes,
pre-empts Roysdon's claim that Reynolds failed to warn him.
   The court also upheld a previous decision of U.S. District Judge
Thomas Hull in Tennessee to direct a verdict in favor of Reynolds
on Roysdon's claim that the company sold a defective, dangerous
product.
   Hull ruled the Roysdons failed to establish a jury case as to
whether the cigarettes were unreasonably dangerous. Hull had ruled
that Roysdon could make a case only for harm he allegedly suffered
during the 10 years he had smoked before filing his product
liability lawsuit in July 1984.
   On Monday, a federal jury in Newark, N.J. found Liggett Group
Inc. had failed to warn the public about smoking's dangers and
violated a promise, or ``express warranty,'' in advertisements that
cigarettes were safe.
   The verdict was the first loss by a tobacco company in a
cigarette liability case. The jury found the cigarette maker partly
responsible for a smoker's lung cancer and awarded $400,000 in
damages to her widower.
   However, the six-member jury cleared Lorillard Inc., Philip
Morris Inc. and Liggett of conspiring to mislead the public about
the risks of smoking.

<HEAD>Projection: Economic Slowdown From Labor Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's second quarter economic
growth rate is expected to fall to 9 percent from 15.6 percent a
year earlier, mainly because of labor disputes over wage hikes, the
Economic Planning Board said Wednesday.
   The projected April-June figure would be the lowest quarterly
growth rate in three years.
   The growth rate for the January-March quarter was 15.1 percent.
   The board projected industrial production, which rose 20.9
percent in the first quarter, would drop to 10 percent growth in
the second quarter.
   Officials said more than 900 labor disputes have occurred so far
this year, mosly in April and May, with 815 of them settled. The
exported-oriented auto industry was hardest hit.
   Korean merchandise exports will rise 19 percent in the second
quarter, compared with 35 percent in the first quarter, according
to the official projection.
   Besides the prolonged labor problem, a strengthened Korean won
also was blamed for a slowdown in exports. The Korean currency has
risen 8.7 percent against the U.S. dollar since January.
   The current account surplus, tallied at $3.02 billion in the
first quarter, is likely to decline to $2.38 billion in the second
quarter, the board said.

   Boris Nikolayevich Naumov, a pioneer of Soviet
computer science who sought joint ventures with American companies,
has died. He was 61.
   Naumov, who died Saturday, had been appointed head of the
Institute of Informatics Problems, which researches computer
technology, in 1983. In 1987, he also became director of the
Intersectorial Scientific and Technological Complex, whose purpose
was to link the research with manufacturing.
   Naumov was responsible for efforts to develop computer science
as part of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms
and openness to the West. In May, Naumov and members of a Soviet
delegation requested a visa to the United States to solicit joint
venture offers from American companies.

   A bull market in grain futures and options also
has been bullish for job hunters on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Last month alone, between 800 and 1,000 more clerks and brokers'
assistants were working on the exchange floor compared with a year
ago, according to Raymond Carmichael, an exchange spokesman.
   He said member firms have hired more assistants to help handle
the activity at the Board of Trade, where the volume is up 15
percent so far this year compared with the same period in 1987.
   Prices have soared for grains and soybean futures due to a
strong global demand for U.S. farm products caused by the dollar's
drop in value, declining stockpiles and a recent drought in the
Midwest.
   ``It's a perfect time to get a job as a runner,'' said another
Board of Trade spokesman, William Murschel. ``Those jobs don't pop
up very often but right now is a good time.''
   Runners deliver trading orders from brokers manning telephones
to traders in the pits.

   Retail sales, held back by lagging car buying,
rose a scant 0.1 percent in May after a relatively rare decline in
April, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said that sales increased $119 million
last month to a seasonally adjusted $131.9 billion.
   It was the sixth increase in seven months, but it was the second
consecutive weak report. The figures are not adjusted to take
inflation into account.
   Most economists had been expecting a slightly stronger 0.4
percent gain. Initial sales statistics are revised heavily in
subsequent months, however, and the May increase could prove to be
stronger.
   Analysts said the preliminary May report, evidence of weak
consumer demand, could somewhat ease the fears of those who believe
inflationary pressures are building in the economy.
   The May increase followed a 0.4 percent decline in April,
revised upward from the previously reported 0.6 percent drop, and
strong gains of 1.6 percent in March and 1.1 percent in February.
   Lackluster sales in April had been attributed to the fact that
Easter fell early in the month than usual, pushing holiday buying
back into March.
   Sales in May were held back by a 1.2 percent fall in automotive
sales to $29.3 billion. That followed a 0.8 percent drop in April.
   Excluding autos, sales rose 0.5 percent in May following a 0.3
percent decline.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three ore more years, were down 0.6 percent while non-durable goods
were up 0.5 percent.
   The department offered these details of May sales:
   _Department and other general merchandise stores, down 0.1
percent after a 1.2 percent drop in April.
   _Hardware and garden supply stores, up 0.2 percent after a month
of no change in April.
   _Furniture and appliance stores, down 0.2 percent, following a
strong 1.3 percent jump a month earlier.
   _Food and grocery stores, up 1.3 percent after a slight 0.1
percent drop.
   _Gasoline, up 0.6 percent after a 0.7 percent decline.
   _Specialty clothing stores, up 1.7 percent; restaurants and
bars, down 0.5 percent, and drug stores, up 0.4 percent.

   The stock market eased slightly today as traders
moved to cash in on profits posted in a strong rally in the
previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which soared 25 points
to a post-crash high on Tuesday, was off 0.53 point at 2,123.93 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.73 million shares. Losers
outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 with 352 up, 531 down and 508
unchanged as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Traders said there was some uncertainty in the market today
following Tuesday's rally that was sparked by a
better-than-expected trade report for April.
   While there was ``basic profit-taking going on,'' buying
interest appeared to remain strong, noted Emmanuel Geronimos, a
senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``I think the market should have sold off a little bit more, but
we're seeing buyers at the moment,'' he said.
   Geronimos said there was little interest in government reports
that showed retail sales rose 0.1 percent and industrial production
rose 0.4 percent, both seasonally adjusted, in May.
   Among actively traded issues, IBM was unchanged at 118}, Texaco
was down [ at 50\, Philip Morris was up [ at 83], and Ford Motor
was unchanged at 52{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.20 to 154.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.21 at 308.67.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,124.47,
up 25.07 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5
to 2 on the NYSE, with 1,091 up, 432 down and 466 unchanged. Big
Board volume totaled 227.15 million shares, against 125.31 million
shares in the previous session.

   Production at the nation's factories, mines
and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in May, the eighth
consecutive month without a decline, the government said today.
   The Federal Reserve said the May advance followed a stronger
gain of 0.6 percent in April, revised down slightly from a previous
estimate of 0.7 percent. There was a climb of 0.2 percent in March
and no change in February.
   The May increase was about in line with expectations. Economists
had predicted a good showing based on a pickup in production at
auto factories. The output of motor vehicles in May surged to an
annual rate of 7.5 million units, up from the 7 million unit rate
in April and a 6.6 million rate in March.
   With the latest growth, overall industrial production now stands
6.1 percent higher than it was a year ago, a further sign of the
resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing sector, which has enjoyed
booming export sales because of the decline in the value of the
dollar.
   The Federal Reserve also noted what it called ``robust gains''
in the output of business equipment. That fits in with previous
reports showing that businesses plan big jumps in modernization and
expansion spending this year.
   Areas of weak growth or decline include appliances and other
goods for the home, food and gasoline and heating oil.
   The May report showed that output in the manufacturing sector
climbed 0.4 percent, reflecting a 0.9 percent pickup in durable
goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years
and a 0.1 percent decline in production of non-durable goods.
   Output in the mining industry fell 0.8 percent in May, following
a 1.9 percent jump a month earlier. This sector, which includes oil
and gas, has been depressed because of falling oil prices.
   Production at the nation's utilities rose 0.7 percent in May
after a 0.8 percent decline the month before.
   The various changes left the industrial production index in May
at 136 percent of the 1977 annual average, up from 135.5 in April.

following Tuesday's rally, which was sparked by a
better-than-expected trade report for April.
   Stocks were off slightly at the opening on basic profit-taking,
but prices dipped further when the commodity markets opened on the
high side.
   ``Corn and soybeans were up the limit,'' noted Charles Jensen,
chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp. Bond prices
softened in turn because of the implication of higher inflation,
and stock prices began to retreat, he said.
   ``We're overdue for a pretty nice correction,'' Jensen said.
``Any setback would be the normal thing to expect.''
   Traders said there was little interest in government reports
that showed retail sales rose 0.1 percent and industrial production
rose 0.4 percent, both seasonally adjusted, in May.

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade widened unexpectedly in the first three months of the year as
a gain in merchandise trade was offset by the country's first
deficit in investment earnings in 30 years, the Commerce Department
reported today.
   The $39.8 billion deficit in the current account, which had
narrowed to $33.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987, jumped a
sharp 18.6 percent from January through March in something of a
surprise to analysts, who had been expecting further improvement in
this trade measurement.
   The current account is the most important of all the trade
statistics released by the government because it covers not only
trade in merchandise but also trade in the services category, which
reflects primarily the flow of investment earnings between
countries.
   For 16 of the last 17 years, the country has run deficits in the
merchandise trade category. But the current account registered a
surplus as recently as 1981 because Americans' earnings on overseas
investments were enough to offset the merchandise deficits.
   In this decade, however, Americans have handed over billions of
dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods, transforming
the country from the world's largest creditor, a distinction it
held in 1982, to the world's largest debtor nation.
   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investments than
Americans hold in foreign investments. While America became a net
debtor in 1985, it had still managed over the last two years to
have a surplus in the investment category of the current account
because many of the U.S. investments had a higher rate of return
than newer foreign investments in this country.
   However, today's report showed that the country suffered a $655
million deficit in the investment category in the first quarter,
the first time this has occurred since 1958.
   While the deficit in investment earnings is small, analysts said
it was an ominous, although not unexpected, development. It means
that American wealth must now be transferred overseas to service
its debt and the only way the total debt will be reduced is for the
country to start running surpluses in the merchandise account,
which experts do not expect to occur anytime soon.
   Many economists have warned that the debt service burden will
eventually lower Americans' standard of living and is the price the
United States will have to pay for living beyond its means in the
1980s.
   But the Reagan administration has sought to play down the shift
to a net debtor, saying the costs of servicing the debt are still a
small percentage of the country's overall economic activity.
   In the first quarter, the merchandise trade deficit shrank by
12.7 percent to $35.95 billion, the biggest improvement in five
years.
   However, the change in the investment category from a surplus to
a deficit added $655 million to the country's overall trade
imbalance. Also adding to the trade imbalance were payments of
$3.15 billion in the category of U.S. foreign aid and pensions for
Americans living overseas.
   These added up to the total deficit of $39.75 billion for the
first quarter.
   For all of 1987, the current account deficit totaled a record
$153.96 billion. Even with the deterioration in investment income,
analysts expect that deficit will show improvement this year
because of the turnaround that is occurring in the merchandise
trade deficit.
   The optimism on merchandise trade was fueled Tuesday by a report
showing that the mercahdise trade deficit for April shrank to $9.89
billion, the lowest monthly deficit in more than three years.
   The Reagan administration immediately hailed the report as proof
that its policy begun in September 1985 of lowering the exchange
value of the dollar was finally bearing fruit.
   A weaker dollar, by making U.S. goods more competitive on
overseas markets, boosts export sales. Export sales have been
hitting a string of record highs, gains which have provided much of
the strength for the overall economy this year.
   However, the weaker dollar was also supposed to curb Americans'
appetite for foreign goods, and that has not happened so far. While
imports did drop by 6.5 percent in April, analysts said the overall
trend is still for rising import sales, in part because foreigners
have been slashing profit margins rather than lose their share of
the lucrative American market.
   Because imports have remained at stubbornly high levels,
economists are cautioning that the improvements in the U.S. trade
deficit, while they will come, will occur at a slow pace.
   ``Although an improvement in our current account deficit is
clearly under way, the ultimate extent and pace of the improvement
are still far from certain,'' Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said in a speech Tuesday night. ``They depend on
developments in exchange markets and in economic policies here and
abroad.''
   Greenspan said one problem the country faces is that further
gains in export sales could be limited as U.S. factories, already
operating at high levels, find they can not meet further demand.
   But private analysts said the string of better trade numbers
virtually assured that President Reagan would win his veto battle
with Congress over trade legislation.
   ``The argument for protectionism is fast disappearing as our
trade deficit improves,'' said Frank McCormick, senior economist
with Bank of America.
   Tuesday's trade numbers were greeted with enthusiasm on Wall
Street, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up by 25.07 points
to close at 2,124.47, its highest level since the October stock
market crash.
   The good news on the U.S. trade balance is coming at an
auspicious time for President Reagan, who leaves Sunday for his
eighth and final economic summit in Toronto.
   The administration hopes to use the summit as a forum to promote
Reagan's free-market philosophy and cement gains made in the past
three years on closer international cooperation.

   Farmers in Ohio prayed for rain and their counterparts in
Illinois feared a 30 percent drop in crop yield as record-high
temperatures aggravated the drought in the nation's midsection.
   About 225 people gathered Tuesday night in a field at the farm
of Gerald and Joanne Lowery south of Fostoria in northwest Ohio for
a special church service.
   The Rev. William Martin of St. Wendelin Roman Catholic Church
conducted the interdenominational service as the congregation sat
in lawn chairs.
   ``We think right away who's the one who gives us the rain. So we
go to the Mass for God,'' he said.
   Martin shook holy water at the crops in all four directions as
he gave a blessing of the field.
   Paul Sheeley, 48, who raises corn, soybeans and wheat north of
Tiffin, Ohio, said the service ``shows that man upstairs we're
interested in what's going on.''
   ``This many people getting together helps. It's like a little
petition, you might say. I can't afford to lose what I planted,''
Sheeley said.
   Sheeley said one-third of his corn crops did not break through
the ground because of a lack of moisture.
   The next two weeks are considered a critical growing period for
Midwestern crops, and without rainfall approaching its normal 4
inches in June, crop yields will suffer, farm experts say.
   Farm yields could drop up to 30 percent in Illinois if the
3-week-old drought there continues, said Terry Francl, an economist
with the American Farm Bureau in Park Ridge, Ill.
   That, in turn, could drive up grocery prices in the coming
months after crops are delivered to food processors, said Evelina
Trainer, senior economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.
   She said bread, cereal, margarine, mayonnaise and vegetable oil
are among the products expected to rise in price.
   The anticipation of smaller harvests already is boosting prices
and trading volume on the commodity exchanges in Chicago. Grain and
soybean prices closed sharply higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, with corn futures reaching their daily price limit.
   ``The options pits are going crazy,'' said clerk Patrick Q.
Sweeny. ``The traders are playing weatherman, trying to forecast
rain ahead of time.''
   Peoria County, Ill., farmer Joe Vonk said he already has written
off his wheat crop. Farmers said the hay fields in the area likely
will be cut only once this summer instead of the usual three times,
and farmers on poorer soil fear their corn and soybean crops will
be the next victims.
   In Michigan, farmers cursed the cloudless blue skies.
   ``They're just shrinking up,'' Rochester, Mich., farmer Dennis
Fogler said of his crops. ``I'm just hoping like heck we get some
water before it's too late.''
   In Washington, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Tuesday the drought ``could well be a catastrophe.''
   Damage already has been done to wheat fields in Montana and the
Dakotas, he said, and additional weeks of scorching temperatures
and no rain could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt and across
the South, he told lawmakers.
   Corn and soybeans are drawing on moisture stored in soil and
remain viable, he said. He added that July weather is more critical
and good rainfall from now on could do much to revitalize the crops.
   Temperatures soared into the 90s in many parts of the nation
Tuesday, and the heat was forecast to continue today.
   The National Weather Service predicted showers for parts of
parched Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Minnesota today, but said
the relief should be short-lived.
   ``It doesn't look like it would be more than a day or so'' that
the rain will fall, weather service meteorologist Hugh Crowther in
Kansas City. Mo., said this morning.

<HEAD>Bank of NY Boosts Bid For Irving</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New York Co. today boosted its bid for
rival Irving Bank Corp. by slightly raising the stock portion of
the offer and adding other shareholder incentives, including a
special cash dividend.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady valued the revised offer
for all of Irving's 18.5 million shares outstanding at about $1.4
billion, or $76.53 per share. Its existing tender offer is valued
at around $1.1 billion, or $64 a share.
   Irving said its board of directors would consider the offer at
its next meeting June 21. The bid was presented during a 40-minute
meeting today between Irving Chairman Joseph Rice and Bank of New
York Chairm J. Carter Bacot.
   The meeting was scheduled after New York State Supreme Court
Justice Herman Cahn suggested the two banks attempt to bridge their
differences. Bank of New York has gone to court to overturn the
results of a proxy battle for control of Irving's board and to
invalidate Irving's anti-takeover ``poison pill.''
   Irving management has consistently rejected Bank of New York's
takeover propoals, favoring instead a friendly merger with Banca
Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second-largest bank.
   Banca Commerciale is offering $80 a share for 9.5 million Irving
shares, or about 51 percent, valued at $760 million. In addition,
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price
from May 31 until the deal closes.
   The proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring plan
that includes, among other things, sale of Irving assets,
cost-cutting measures and a special cash dividend.
   Bacot said Bank of New York's new bid ``is clearly superior'' to
the Banca Commerciale offer, which has a blended value of as much
as $76.53 per share.
   Wall Street also acted postively to the offer. In midday trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, Irivng jumped $3.12{ a share to
$69.37{, while Bank of New York fell 87.5 cents to $32.87{.
   Bank of New York said its new offer includes $15 in cash, 1.675
shares of its stock, a one-time $2.50 cash dividend and securities
valued at up to $2.50 per share. The securities promise to disburse
profits from the sale of Irving's Wall Street headquarters.
   The existing tender offer, which expires later this month, is
for $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of Bank of New York stock.
   Bank of New York said the offer was subject to the approval of
Irving's board and redemption of its poison pill, which would make
an unsolicited merger prohibitedly expensive.

   The Supreme Court today allowed Americans who
sue foreign corporations to notify those corporations through their
U.S. subsidiaries.
   The court voted unanimously to let survive a wrongful-death
lawsuit against Volkswagenwerk Aktiengensellschaft (VWAG), a West
Germany-based corporation, growing out of a 1983 traffic accident
in Illinois.
   At issue was whether an international agreement dealing with how
defendants are informed about pending litigation against them _
what lawyers call ``service'' _ precludes state laws allowing other
methods.
   The Hague Service Convention, ratified by both the United States
and West Germany, provides methods for transmitting judicial and
other documents for service abroad.
   But writing for the high court today, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said the Hague Service Convention does not apply when, as
in Illinois, a state law makes a foreign corporation's subsidiary
the legal recipient of service.
   ``Where service on a domestic agent is valid and complete under
both state law and the (Constitution's) due process clause, our
inquiry ends and the Convention has no further implications,''
O'Connor said.
   She added, ``Contrary to VWAG's assertion, the due process
clause does not require an official transmittal of documents abroad
every time there is service on a foreign national.''
   Herwig Schlunk sued the West German car manufacturer in 1984
over the Dec. 17, 1983 death of his parents, Franz and Slyvia
Schlunk in a Cook County traffic accident.
   The Schlunks were driving a 1978 VW Rabbit when a negligently
driven car collided head-on with theirs. Their son's suit alleged
that the VW's design contributed to their deaths.
   Schlunk's lawyers sought to deliver a summons and a copy of the
complaint to VWAG through the registered Illinois agent of
Volkswagen of America Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary of VWAG.
   Lawyers for VWAG contended that an Illinois state court's
jurisdiction over it could be invoked only after service was
perfected in accordance with the international agreement.
   That argument was rejected by the justices today, and the case
will proceed in the Illinois state court.
   The case is Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft vs. Schlunk,
86-1052.

<HEAD>Earnings Expected To Decline Because of Lucky Purchase, Skaggs
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Stores Co.'s earnings are
expected to decline for the remainder of 1988 because of its $2.5
billion acquisition of Lucky Stores, American Stores Chairman L.S.
Skaggs told the company's annual meeting.
   But Skaggs said at Tuesday's gathering he expected the
supermarket company's earnings to improve in 1989.
   ``We have chosen to operate the company not for the short-term
gain but rather the good of our shareholders over the long term,''
he said. ``The reason for our acquisition (of Lucky) was to create
long-term value for our shareholders. Our past history has shown
that this strategy has been successful.''
   John M. Lillie, formerly chairman and chief executive officer of
Lucky and now head of American's new Alpha Beta-Lucky subsidiary,
said combining the two companies' operations in California and
Nevada will give American 600 stores with annual sales of about $8
billion.
   Lillie said Alpha Beta will be fashioned into a low-cost
supermarket chain designed for ``the efficient shopper,'' which he
said is one who values shopping time but wants low food prices and
quality products.
   ``Recognizing the value of our customers' time, we also will
institute various Lucky service programs in all the Alpha Beta
stores,'' he said. He referred to Lucky's checkout system that
allows shoppers to pay for their groceries with an automatic teller
machine card and also receive as much as $200 in cash.
   Lillie said that before the acquisition by American Stores,
Lucky began working on a plan called ``the California Strategy.''
   ``This continues to move ahead. The strategy is for us to
dispose our stores in Arizona and in Florida. We will become a
company that serves markets (only) in California and Nevada,'' he
said.
   Lucky already has sold its Arizona stores, and it will ``move
ahead shortly'' to sell its Florida stores, he said.
   ``Our California strategy will allow us to become totally
focused on maximizing the value of our strong market position in
California where the combined operation will have full market share
well in excess of 20 percent,'' said Lillie.
   In a presentation of American Stores' 1987 financial results,
Victor L. Lund, chief financial officer, said the company has
considered its sales for the year to be below expectation.
   The company earned $154.3 million, or $4.19 a share, on sales of
$14.27 billion, compared to $14.5 million, or $3.79 a share, on
sales of $14.02 billion in 1986.
   Shareholders re-elected as directors Skaggs; Leon G. Harmon,
director and former president of First Interstate Bank of Utah, and
I.J. Wagner, president of the Keystone Co., Salt Lake City, and
elected as director John E. Masline, former senior partner of the
accounting firm Ernst & Whinney.

<HEAD>Most Grain, Soybean Futures Open Limit Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rocketed higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as weather forecasters reduced
the amount of rain in their short-term predictions for the Midwest.
   Prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn and oats all
rocketed up their limits for daily trading within seconds of the
opening bell.
   In addition to the weather forecasts, buying interest was stoked
by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng's statement Tuesday that the
dry weather had the potential for becoming a national disaster,
analysts said.
   ``Those statements by Lyng were on traders' minds,'' said Walter
Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New
York. ``There's just a general bullishness (in the grain markets)
and no one wants to miss it.''
   The drought has begun to take a toll on the corn crop, which is
in a critical stage of development, and will reduce soybean yields
if it continues for another two weeks, Spilka said.
   In early trading, wheat was 5 cents to 10 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.80 a bushel; corn was 6 cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.79{ a bushel; oats were 5 cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.76{ a bushel; soybeans were 7{
cents to 30 cents higher with July at $9.15 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .48 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June at
71.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to 1 cent lower
with August at 72.45 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower to .10
cent higher with June at 50.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .45 cent lower to .08 cent higher with July at 46.45 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Gus Ober: Image Maker For Those Who Already Have `It'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gustavus Ober is an image maker for those who
already have It.
   Money. Clothes. Looks. Personality. Probably in that order.
   For a minimum $10,500 per six-month season, Ober sees that his
personal clients are launched into social orbit. He makes sure they
are invited to New York's proper parties, that they sit at
influential tables at glamorous galas and have dazzling guest lists
for their own soirees.
   Getting Ober to take you on is no small social coup.
   ``I don't take on anybody who I don't think has it,'' he says
simply.
   Seated on an overstuffed magenta couch behind a coffee table
ladened with copies of Vanity Fair and Gourmet magazines, Ober
describes himself as one of a handful of ``personal publicists'' in
the Big Apple who can do in six months what it would take someone
even with the most vibrant qualities six years to accomplish on the
social circuit.
   ``It's expensive,'' he admits. ``You have to have the clothes,
especially if you're a woman.'' A few ``terribly expensive,
sensational dresses'' are just the core of the necessary wardrobe,
he said.
   ``And you have to be willing to entertain and willing to buy
tickets'' to charity benefits, among the more popular grazing
grounds of the wantless.
   Ober even will try to persuade Architectural Digest to feature a
client's apartment _ if the apartment is up to it and if the client
is willing to live with the risks that go along with the general
public knowing just how many Ming vases are sitting on the
mantlepiece.
   While reluctant to disclose his client list, the rotund,
``over-50-year-old'' Ober said many are wealthy newcomers to the
city.
   The reason they seek him out, Ober says, is that ``people are
looking for recognition'' _ from their peers as well as the working
class guy riding the subway who invariably will read about them in
the gossip columns of the daily tabloids.
   Much ink goes to what Ober calls ``nouvelle society'' _ the
likes of real estate devloper Donald Trump and his Czech-born wife,
Ivana.
   ``You can't pick up a paper without the daily press release on
the Trumps,'' he sniffed.
   New York is a different animal of a city. Attributes like
``nice'' and ``intelligent'' may suffice elsewhere, but in New York
the operative characteristic is to be amusing.
   ``Society is a surface scene, so you have to have the right
qualities _ in particular, to be amusing,'' Ober said. ``To be
interesting to anybody here, you have to have a serious interest,''
he said, citing two cosmetic queens.
   ``Elizabeth Arden had her horses, and Helena Rubenstein had her
art,'' he noted. Ironically, investor Asher Edelman, considered by
some to have amassed the most impressive private art collection in
the city, typically is absent from Ober's social scene.
   Ober lived very much the life of many of his clients _ attending
the prestigious St. Paul's boarding school and Princeton
University, where he graduated with a degree in English.
   He worked five years as a reporter for the Baltimore Sun,
interrupted by a stint in the Army, and later traveled the country
for S&H Greenstamps before coming to settle in New York, with no
particular game plan.
   But society is his element, and circulating in it his great
pleasure. Ober realized that when he was about 16 years old and
attended a ``very glamorous'' New Year's Eve party at the home of
Mrs. Evalyn Walsh McLean, the socialite who bought the Hope diamond
and wore it until she died in 1947.
   ``Very few people have the staff to give a party at home
anymore,'' he said, waxing sentimental about a bygone era of maids
in starch-white aprons, cucumber sandwiches and silver tea trays.
   Among some of Ober's observations:
   _``Ladies That Lunch,'' those eulogized by songwriter Stephen
Sondheim, have become a dying breed.
   _Playboys are out. A lot of people play, but the label ``isn't
that helpful anymore.''
   _It's okay to befriend a few penniless ``little people,'' as
long as they are amusing.
   _Safaris in Kenya are still in, as long as you're there to
socialize with government officials and wealthy expatriates and not
to charge after wild game.

   ``There's a lot of hype about being in the labor room and all
that, but being the father is still being an outsider,'' said
Ecker, 34. ``I was a wallflower and melted in with the plants
wherever we were.''
   His wife, who apparently has a green thumb for wallflowers,
understood. She bought him a baseball cap and attached a
``Father-to-Be'' logo.
   Thus was born a business empire: Beegotten Creations, a
whimsical little company that aims to provide novelty items to
every expectant relative.
   It is a small empire, with sales of $750,000 last year _ but it
is an empire nonetheless, with ``Family-to-Bee'' T-shirts, mugs,
hats, key rings, mugs, night shirts and even underwear on sale in
2,200 stores nationwide and in the Virgin Islands and the Bahamas.
   The couple is even thinking of expanding out of their current
headquarters, the basement and garage of their Spring Valley home.
   ``I remember the old days when it would rain and I'd put the car
in the garage,'' said Susan wistfully, amid the garage warehouse
crammed with the shirts, mugs and other items.
   The corporate headquarters _ also known as the family room _ is
adorned with photos of the couple's three children, Holly 8, Deena,
6, and Ari, almost 4. The children wander in to use the TV set and
VCR; sometimes they, like their parents, model the company's
clothes.
   The Eckers have part-time help these days _ enough so that
notices about workmen's compensation and labor laws are posted
alongside the kids' photos.
   But the company's toll-free number is generally answered by the
Eckers, even if it wakes them up at 2 a.m.
   All of this came of that single baseball cap that Ecker received
five years ago, and of the cap's popularity.
   Every time Ecker wore it to the beach ``another belly came up to
me and asked where I got the hat. They wanted it for their
husbands,'' Ecker said.
   For Ecker, who had spent his life selling toilet paper, the
inspiration couldn't have come at a better time: ``Toilet paper was
losing its glamour. I used to tell people I was working my way up
to tissues,'' said Ecker.
   Armed with his sense of humor and marketing skills, the Eckers
took their talents to a hidden market _ the relatives of the
baby-to-be. And to jazz it up, they replaced the ``be'' in ``father
to be'' with a yellow bumblebee.
   When Ecker first took samples of his hats and shirts to
retailers, small maternity shops were his best customers; he found
that the people who bought the items were not men, but moms-to-be.
   Department stores were uninterested and remain indifferent. They
have no departments for men's maternity items.
   Ecker's road trips and mail-order advertising in maternity
magazines paid off. He abandoned the toilet paper trade in 1984 to
devote himself to Beegotten Creations and expanded the family line
to include grandmas, grandpas, sisters and brothers.
   While relatives provided a fresh market for the Eckers' novelty
items, the Eckers soon realized that the ``real money'' was in
maternity clothes.
   So now, the garage-warehouse stocks nursing shirts reading,
``I'd rather be sleeping,'' maternity underwear with the slogan,
``Oh, to be thin again,'' and T-shirts and nightshirts from ``Prego
State'' and ``Camp Prego.''
   The company boasts 54 different items and more to come, with a
new focus on the actual baby _ shirts, bibs and stretchies bearing
such prophetic sayings as ``Princess to Bee,'' ``Trouble to Bee,''
``Doctor to Bee'' and ``Extremely Complex to Bee.''
   If Susan was the center of attention during her pregnancies,
Lloyd plays the starring role at Beegotten Creations. He's the
company's president, says Susan, because ``it's hard to live with a
6-foot-4 poutty man.''
   Last year, Ecker tried to start a new business. When a woman
found out she was pregnant, she would call Ecker. He would don a
bumblebee outfit and went to the husband's office. There,
resplendent in his yellow-and-black finery, he would announce that
the husband was a father-to-be.
   After a dozen or so such calls, the ``Bee-Man'' went into
semi-retirement because of cold weather. It's unclear whether
summer will witness the revival of the 6-foot-4 walking insect.

<HEAD>Employee-Owned Company Looks Back After Three Years</HEAD>

   Tom Klimovich paused, looked at his boss
and made sure he wasn't revealing any secrets when he talked about
his toughest decision since becoming a director at Seymour
Specialty Wire.
   Given the go-ahead, Klimovich told about his vote approving a
consultant's plan that has resulted in the elimination of 13 jobs
at the 110-year-old mill bought three years ago by its employees.
   Klimovich's position was the same as that of eight other
directors, but he was more vulnerable to criticism. He is president
of United Auto Workers Local 1827, and as such, is trusted with
protecting the company's blue-collar workers.
   ``When push comes to shove, decisions are made for the best
interest of the company. It's not easy sometimes,'' said Klimovich.
``It's been on-the-job experience. From the day we decided to to
this it's been an education.''
   The company's employees bought the plant from National
Distillers & Chemical Corp. a little more than three years ago, on
April 17, 1985, for a reported $10 million. They established an
employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, under which each employee
owns a piece of the company.
   Seymour Wire is the largest employee-owned company in
Connecticut, and has a management team unlike any other in the
country, according to President Carl Drescher.
   The company is run by nine directors that include the company
president, the union president, five elected employees and two
outside members selected by the other seven.
   The arrangement has led to a democratically run company that
often finds its members wearing more than one hat making some
difficult choices.
   The company has been profitable for its roughly 220 employees,
55 of whom are salaried. It doesn't make its finances public, but
it will be free of creditors in about five years.
   About 60 percent of the stock is still held by those who loaned
money for the buyout, Drescher said from his office overlooking the
mill and the nearby Naugatuck River.
   Drescher, a 58-year-old Woodbury resident, was plant manager
when the employees made their buyout offer. He had been at the
company for 11 years at the time and fully supported the move
because the mill was profitable.
   National Distillers had decided to sell the wire mill simply
because it wanted out of the metals business.
   Freed from a corporate parent, Seymour Wire has learned to
handle its own insurance and pension plans, and monitor its
finances with existing staff, said Drescher.
   ``We had to put in a computer and take care of all these other
functions,'' Drescher said. ``But the other thing is we are more
free to do what needs to be done. We don't have a hierarchy to go
through. We make up our own minds here.''
   Given its success, Seymour Wire has been visited by people from
across this country and as far away as China. Drescher said it can
be distracting and he tries to limit company tours. But he does
have some advice for others considering a similar course of action.
   ``If it's a unionized operation, it's important that there has
been good union relations beforehand,'' he said. ``You've also got
to have a viable operation. I think some ESOPs have been tried
where perhaps they shouldn't have been. This was not a last-gasp
effort to save jobs.''
   Drescher has put his experience at the plant to good use, but he
also continues to gain more business know-how. His most recent
learning experience was the negotiation of a new three-year
contract with the blue-collar employees.
   The previous contract had been negotiated when the plant was
sold, and a new one was put in place on the the company's third
anniversary.
   ``The board is controlled by employees. It was a difficult
position for union officials to be directors,'' Drescher said.
``They have to represent the interests of the union and
shareholders.''
   The contract took about two weeks to negotiate, and Klimovich
said it was unique because all employees know the company's
finances.
   ``I knew what the company could do, and it helped,'' said
Klimovich, who at age 43 has worked at the plant for 17 years. His
father worked at the plant for more than 40 years.
   The unionized workers earn an average of about $25,000 a year
and receive shares of the stock based upon their earnings, said
Drescher. The company has a turnover of about 12 employees a year,
which helped the company implement the consultant's recommendations
that troubled Klimovich.
   The consultant said the company needed to reorganize its work
schedules to become more efficient. Seymour Wire decided to make
the schedule change and adjust to the subsequent loss of 13 jobs
through attrition rather than layoffs. That process is now nearly
complete.
   Drescher and Klimovich said the labor-management problems
encountered at the company are no different than when it was owned
by National Distillers. Employees, however, are more willing to
voice their opinions and suggestions.
   ``It's beneficial for them to say something. They point out
things that need to be addressed,'' Drescher said.
   ``The grumblers are grumblers. There are people who are going to
grumble no matter waht you do,'' said Klimovich.

   The stock market held at slightly lower levels
today after traders moved to cash in on profits following a strong
rally in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 25 points
to a post-crash high on Tuesday, was off 5.87 points at 2,118.60 by
midday.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 74.39 million shares. Losers
outnumbered gainers by about 11 to 8 with 533 up, 751 down and 503
unchanged as of noon on Wall Street.
   Traders said there was some uncertainty in the market today
following Tuesday's rally, which was sparked by a
better-than-expected trade report for April.
   Stocks were off slightly at the opening on basic profit-taking,
but prices dipped further when the commodity markets opened on the
high side.
   ``Corn and soybeans were up the limit,'' noted Charles Jensen,
chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp. Bond prices
softened in turn because of the implication of higher inflation,
and stock prices began to retreat, he said.
   ``We're overdue for a pretty nice correction,'' Jensen said.
``Any setback would be the normal thing to expect.''
   But the tone remains optimistic. Several technicians revised
their market forecasts favorably today.
   In addition, money managers, who have an unusually high amount
of cash on hand, are looking to buy equities for their portfolios
as the second quarter draws to a close. As one trader said, ``They
want to hop aboard the train before it leaves the station.''
   Dealers said the market had little interest in government
reports that showed retail sales rose 0.1 percent and industrial
production rose 0.4 percent, both seasonally adjusted, in May.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down ] at 50, Exxon was
down { at 46\, Zenith was up 1} at 26[, Chrysler was off \ at 24~,
and Philip Morris was up \ at 83}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.63 to 153.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.42 at 308.46.

<HEAD>Kansas Laws Apply To Five-State Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas courts may apply that state's laws in a
natural gas royalties dispute between an oil company and mineral
rights owners from five states, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, ruled that applying Kansas law to
claims against Sun Oil Co. by people in other states is valid.
   The decision, carried in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia,
upheld a Kansas Supreme Court ruling that Sun is liable for
interest on some previously suspended gas royalties.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor dissented, and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not
participate.
   The controversy began in 1979 when property owners in Kansas
sued Sun in state court to recover royalties for higher gas rates
charged to the company's customers.
   Some 3,100 owners of natural gas leases in Texas, Oklahoma,
Louisiana, New Mexico and Mississippi were represented in the class
action lawsuit.
   Sun had suspended payment of some royalties while awaiting
approval of the higher gas rates by the Federal Power Commission.
   After the rates were approved, the leaseholders sought to
recover not only the higher royalties but also the interest they
said they were owed for Sun's use of their money.
   The Kansas Supreme Court ruled last year Sun owed interest on
the increased royalties based on rates prevailing in Kansas during
the time the suit was pending.
   The interest rates ranged from 10.5 percent to 16.5 percent.
   The Kansas court also ruled the state's statute of limitations,
imposing a five-year deadline for filing such suits, applied to all
claims against Sun, regardless of what state the gas rights are
located.
   The nation's highest court agreed last October to hear Sun's
appeal, and today it ruled against the company.
   The case is Sun Oil vs. Wortman, 87-352.

   The European Space Agency sent
three satellites into orbit Wednesday on the first Ariane 4, a
powerful new rocket it hopes will provide a competitive edge in the
race to commercialize space.
   Ariane 4 blasted off without a hitch into clear skies above the
space agency center on the north coast of South America at 8:19
a.m. Officials of Arianespace, the agency's commercial arm,
proclaimed the inaugural launch ``a complete success.''
   President Francois Mitterrand of France sent a telegram saying:
``This new step in the space program assures the lasting presence
of Europe in the world launch competition that will be more and
more difficult.''
   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloads
and has 67 launch contracts worth $3.4 billion. It counts on
Wednesday's launch to demonstrate the space readiness and
reliability of the Ariane 4, Europe's biggest and most versatile
rocket ever.
   First-stage boosters fired 66 seconds after liftoff and the
final, third-stage rockets, fired at 5 minutes 49 seconds into the
flight. The rocket reached orbit in 12 minutes 46 seconds with its
international payload _ the European Meteosat P2 and Amsat 3C, and
the American PAS 1.
   Technicians at the space center said the boosters fired and
orbit was achieved precisely as planned. Frederic d'Allest,
chairman of Arianespace, called the launch ``a milestone in the
development of the European space effort.''
   Europe developed the Ariane over six years at a cost of $575
million and will compete in the coming decade with commercial
launch programs in the United States, Soviet Union, China and
Japan. By 1992, the international commercial launch market is
expected to be worth $1 billion a year.
   The U.S. space program has been stalled since the shuttle
Challenger blew up in January 1986, killing all seven astronauts
aboard.
   Ariane 4 will be Europe's ``workhorse on the world launch
services market until the end of this century,'' according to a
statement by Arianespace officials. It can lift 4.6 tons into orbit
compared with 2.8 tons for Ariane 3, its predecessor.
   The next rocket, Ariane 5, is not expected to begin service
until 1995.
   In addition to providing increased power, the Ariane 4 design
allows engineers to use different configurations of solid and
liquid boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's specific
budget and needs, the agency said.
   On Wednesday it used two liquid and two solid boosters.
   Meteostat-P2 will furnish weather data to 16 European countries.
The 1,559-pound satellite will monitor weather over most of Europe,
Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of South America. It
replaces the Meteostat F2, launched in 1981, which until recently
sent back pictures every half hour.
   Amsat 3C, a 330-pound satellite known by the nickname Oscar 13,
will serve the amateur radio operators around the world.
   The American satellite PAS 1, owned by the American
telecommunications company Pan American Satellite, is to provide
telecommuncations service at moderate cost among Latin America, the
United States and Europe.

<HEAD>Overall Trade Deficit Widens, Retail Sales Weak, Industrial
Production Rises</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to incorporate reports of first-quarter trade
deficit and industrial production. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   America's overall trade deficit widened unexpectedly in the
first quarter of the year, the government said today in an ominous
report about the U.S. economic future.
   The Commerce Department release came one day after stocks and
bonds rallied powerfully in reaction to another report that the
April merchandise trade deficit shrank to $9.89 billion, the best
showing in more than three years.
   But the department said today the broadest measure of U.S.
trade, which includes services and investment earnings as well as
merchandise, showed a $39.8 billion deficit in the first quarter,
vs. a $33.5 billion deficit the previous quarter. The rise was from
a decline in investment earnings abroad.
   This figure is considered important because it is a key
reflection of how the United States has been transformed from the
world's largest creditor nation six years ago into the world's
largest debtor now.
   It means America's wealth must now be transferred abroad to
service its debt and the only way the total debt will be reduced is
for the country to start running surpluses in merchandise, which
experts do not expect soon.
   Many economists have warned the debt service burden will
eventually lower Americans' standard of living, the price the
United States will have to pay for living beyond its means in the
1980s.
   The latest trade news and fear of a Midwestern drought combined
to have a sobering effect on Wall Street. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrial stocks, which surged 25 points to a post-crash high
Tuesday, was off 5.87 points at 2,118.60 by midday. Bond prices
also eased after a strong showing Tuesday.
   Other government reports released today suggested a mixed
picture of the economy.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales, restrained by lagging
car purchases, rose a scant 0.1 percent in May, evidence of weak
consumer demand and a possible economic slowdown.
   On the other hand, the Federal Reserve said production at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in May, the eighth consecutive month without a decline.
   With the latest growth, overall industrial production now stands
6.1 percent higher than it was a year ago, a further sign of the
resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
   In other news Tuesday, oil prices rose after the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to prolong an
output-restraint pact until the end of the year.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, rose 40 cents to
settle at $16.83 per barrel.
   Elsewhere, major automakers said sales of domestically built
cars and light trucks fell 4.1 percent in early June from last
year's levels for the same period. But industry analysts attributed
the decline largely to buying incentives that inflated sales in the
year-earlier period.
   Car sales were down for all domestic makers except Toyota Motor
Corp., which was just beginning U.S. production last year, and
Mazda Motor Corp., which began U.S. production in September.

<TEXT>
   A jury has rejected a $48 million suit filed
by a couple who said their Audi 5000 car surged forward and killed
their 6-year-old son.
   The federal jury deliberated three hours Tuesday before finding
in favor of Audi AG of West Germany and its parent, Volkswagen of
America, in one of numerous suits alleging Audis are subject to
sudden, unintended acceleration.
   John and Kristi Bradosky of Jackson Township near Canton, had
said their son Joshua was pinned between the car and their garage
wall in 1986.
   Mrs. Bradosky said the engine was running and that she had
shifted from park into drive and gently placed her foot on the
accelerator when the car surged forward and would not stop despite
pressure on the brake pedal.
   The family sought $24 million in compensatory damages each from
Audi and Volkswagen. They also asked for $36 million in punitive
damages from Volkswagen, but U.S. District Judge David Dowd had
barred such an award.
   The judge had instructed the jurors to find for the defendants
if they were unable to name a defect that caused the accident.
   ``The jury found no defect in the vehicle,'' said Ian Ceresney,
an attorney for Audi. ``I think it vindicates our case. It
demonstrated that the jury found the vehicle did not cause the
accident.''
   Bradosky said he had not decided whether to appeal. ``I think
the jury has made a decision, and we think it was a wrong
decision,'' he said. ``They made a critical error in judgment.''
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group based in
Washington, contends at least 1,646 accidents resulting in 402
injuries and five deaths have been linked to sudden acceleration
when the Audi 5000 was shifted into gear.
   Investigators have been unable to find any defect common to the
vehicles that would cause the problem.
   Audi last week offered to settle a class-action lawsuit in
Chicago that could affect as many as 300,000 Audi owners
nationwide. Under the proposed settlement, the company would pay up
to $2,000 to past and current owners of Audi 5000s who buy a new
Audi. The automaker did not admit fault.

   The working mother has made the transition
from novelty to national norm, with more than half of new mothers
remaining in the job market for the first time, the Census Bureau
reported Wednesday.
   ``Every time a statistic approaches the 50 percent mark of the
labor force, it's not an oddity anymore, it's a way of life,'' said
Martin O'Connell, chief of the bureau's Fertility Statistics Branch.
   The labor force participation rate for new mothers climbed to
50.8 percent last year from 49.8 percent in 1986, marking the first
time a majority of women reported they were working or actively
seeking employment within a year of giving birth.
   By comparison, only 31 percent of new mothers were counted in
the labor force in 1976, the first year the Census Bureau sought to
calculate this rate.
   O'Connell noted that the share of new mothers remaining in the
workforce has grown steadily over the last decade, a result of
women's increasing propensity to delay marriage and childbearing in
favor of jobs and education.
   Women who accumulate more years of schooling and work experience
before having children have ``greater financial resources to enable
them, once they have a child, to obtain child-care services and get
back to the labor force much quicker,'' O'Connell explained in a
telephone interview.
   In addition, they have ``increased career commitment and
increased cost of staying out of the labor force, compared to an
18- or 19-year-old who had a child earlier'' in life, he said.
   O'Connell pointed to findings that 68 percent of women who had
their first child at age 30 or over remained in the job market,
compared with 54 percent of those age 18 to 24.
   For new mothers with college degrees, the job rate was 63
percent, well above the 38 percent rate for those whose education
ended during high school.
   The new study, ``Fertility of American Women: June 1987,'' also
disclosed a substantial increase in the number of two-earner
families with children. It concentrated on women age 18 to 44, the
normal childbearing ages.
   The increasing share of mothers returning to jobs led to a total
of 13.4 million two-worker families with children last year, up
from 8.3 million in 1976.
   The number of childless couples with both husband and wife
employed and the wife of childbearing age increased from 3.0
million to 4.3 million over the 11-year period.
   ``A lot has been said about DINKS (dual-income, no-kids
families) ... (and) given the attention, one would be led to think
there are many more than there actually are,'' O'Connell said.
   ``The real story is the number of dual-employed couples where
they have a child ... that's the big nesws that's been happening
the last 10 years,'' said O'Connell.
   At 13.4 million, dual-earner couples with children make up more
than 40 percent of all married couples in the childbearing ages,
O'Connell pointed out.
   That, he added, means that American businesses will have to pay
close attention to the needs of these workers and families.
   O'Connell addressed the topic last year in a separate, privately
published analysis, ``Juggling Jobs and Babies: America's Child
Care Challenge.''
   That report, which he said remains valid, warned that smaller
numbers of people born in recent years means fewer workers
available, making it harder for business to replace experienced
women who have children.
   The result will be a need to cope with the needs of working
mothers, including such possibilities as flexible work schedules,
employer-sponsored child care, flexible benefit plans and other new

   Other findings of the new Census Bureau study included:
   _The national birth rate for the 12 months ended in June 1987
was 71 births per 1,000 women age 18 to 44, up slightly from the
rate of 70.3 per 1,000 a year earlier. The rate was 68.5 for white
women, 83.2 for black women and 95.8 for Hispanic women. It was
95.0 for married women, 38.1 for single women and 23.5 for women
who were widowed or divorced.
   _Labor force participation among new mothers was 53 percent for
blacks, 51 percent for whites and 36 percent for Hispanics.
   _Widowed, divorced and separated mothers were most likely to be
working, at 66 percent. Married women were second at 49.8 percent,
followed by single mothers at 49.5 percent.

<HEAD>Stores Cut Back As Sales Remain Disappointing</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   If 1987 was an off year for the nation's
retailers, 1988 bears the earmarks of disaster.
   Storeowners, whose sales have run at a sluggish pace since early
last year, have seen their results deteriorate further in recent
months and are being forced to tighten their belts.
   ``They're watching their expenses carefully; they've cut back on
new stores they open,'' said Fred Wintzer, a retail industry
analyst with the investment firm Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in
Baltimore.
   Robert Buchanan, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis, estimated overall retail sales have risen 1 to 2 percent so
far this year, compared with the same period in 1987.
   ``That's probably 2 percent below where retailers would have
liked to be, well below (their) plan,'' he said.
   Buchanan's assessment is based on what the retail industry calls
same-store sales, those from stores open for at least 12 months.
Analysts say these sales provide a more accurate scale for
comparing a store's year-to-year performance than do figures that
include sales from newer stores.
   Individual results from some of the biggest retailers support
Buchanan's estimate. The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck
and Co., said its same-store sales through the end of May were up
1.1 percent, while No. 2 K mart Corp. reported a 1.7 percent
increase. J.C. Penney Co. Inc. had a 1.5 percent gain, as did
Dayton Hudson Corp.
   Some retailers reported declines: May Department Stores Co.
sales fell 0.3 percent and the apparel retailer Limited Inc.
suffered a 5 percent drop.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., with a 12 percent gain, is one of the rare
exceptions to the rule. Analysts attribute the discounter's
enviable performance to its aggressive price discounts.
   But overall, with sales increases of 2 percent or less, the
industry is losing profits _ first-quarter results were generally
disappointing _ and losing ground to inflation.
   Through May, wholesale prices rose 3.4 percent, while consumer
prices jumped 4.5 percent through April, according to U.S. Labor
Department figures.
   A couple of points must be kept in mind: No one, neither
analysts nor the stores themselves, expected 1988 to be a banner
year. And, the first half of any year is not as important to
retailers as the second half, which includes the back-to-school and
holiday seasons.
   That aside, 1988 has been terrible. Analysts say consumers have
spent gingerly while they pay off high installment debt levels.
   ``The year was projected to be bad and turned out worse,'' said
Wintzer of Alex. Brown.
   ``The head counts going into the stores haven't changed _ people
are spending less,'' said Joseph Ronning, an analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman Inc. ``Instead of buying two items, you're buying
one.''
   The problem is compounded in the women's clothing sector, where
sales have been slowed by boredom as much as frugality. Consumers
who grew disenchanted with the fashions last fall are equally
unenthused about spring and summer wear.
   ``What's in the stores is competing primarily with what's in
women's closets, and the closets are winning,'' said William Smith,
an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   After last year's disappointing sales, many retailers went into
1988 with already conservative plans. For instance, Deb Shops Inc.,
a chain of nearly 279 women's apparel stores, decided to open fewer
locations this year than last year, president Marvin Rounick said.
   But some retailers are cutting back even further, making
adjustments in expansion programs and buying operations.
   ``Building plans and store additions are being tapered down,''
said Buchanan of A.G. Edwards.
   The retailers tended to downplay any cutbacks, while
acknowledging that times are difficult.
   Zayre Corp. has trimmed its plans to open approximately 100 new
stores by one or two stores, said vice president and treasurer
Steven Wishner.
   ``We have not made any significant changes to our store opening
plan,'' he said, but added, ``We are constantly reviewing the
situation.''
   The sales decline has also made retailers take a harder look
before signing real estate contracts.
   ``When sales get soft like this, it seems prudent to take a
wait-and-see attitude,'' said Matt Miller, a senior vice president
at Petrie Stores Corp., which operates more than 1,600 specialty
stores.
   ``We've postponed making certain deals until we get a better
feel for the real estate outlook,'' Miller said.
   Charming Shoppes Inc., with more than 850 apparel stores, has
had to consider slumping sales when deciding whether a particular
location was affordable, said vice president Bernard Brodsky.
   ``We turned down a bigger percentage of the (real estate) deals
that were shown to us,'' Brodsky said.
   Like many other retailers, Charming Shoppes has kept its
inventory low and delayed buying for the coming seasons, Brodsky
said.
   ``If things had turned about in the spring, we would have been
more positive about our buying in the fall,'' he said. ``When we
see things are doing well, we will then finish up the remainder of
our buying.''
   Whether business will pick up is a matter for debate among the
analysts, in part because a hoped-for autumn recovery in apparel
sales may not materialize. Monroe H. Greenstein, an analyst with
Bear Stearns & Co., said fashions being test-marketed have failed
to excite consumers.
   ``It looks like for the fall, there may not be any strong
fashion trend,'' he said.
   Smith, the analyst at Smith Barney, was very pessimistic. ``If I
had to guess, I'd say we write off '88,'' he said.
   More upbeat was Walter Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &
Co.: ``The second half will be much stronger.''
   ``I don't think the fashion message will be very strong, but it
will be enough of an incentive to bring customers back into the
stores,'' Loeb said.
   If nothing else, industry observers say, last year's results
will make the second-half performance appear more robust.
   ``You're going to have easier comparisons,'' said Ronning of
Brown Brothers.

foreign exchange dealers said. Gold prices also rose.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7848 late Wednesday,
cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7925.
   Other late rates in Europe Wednesday compared with late

   Gold dealers said their market was sluggish but the price rose
because of mostly speculative dealings.
   The Hong Kong gold market was closed for a holiday.

   Coleco has almost no cash, has curtailed production, slashed its
staff size and arranged for short-term financing through June 30.
It has also offered a number of its product lines for sale to raise
cash.
   The company, manufacturer of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, has set a

   The stock market tentatively flirted with plus
territory today but retreated to lower levels after Tuesday's sharp
rally touched off a bout of profit-taking.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 25 points
to a post-crash high on Tuesday, was down 3.56 points at 2,210.91
an hour before the closing bell.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 123.88 million shares. Losers
outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 8 with 682 up, 766 down and 510
unchanged as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   In midafternoon, the Dow was up nearly a point but then pulled
back.
   Traders said there was some uncertainty in the market today
following Tuesday's rally, which was sparked by a
better-than-expected trade report for April.
   Stocks were off slightly throughout the session mirroring the
bond market, where prices were depressed partly because of
inflation fears generated by sharply higher grain and other
commodity prices.
   ``Corn and soybeans were up the limit,'' noted Charles Jensen,
chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
   But Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at
A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said traders used the
activity in the commodity markets as an excuse to sell.
   ``Whenever the market gets overbought, traders look for an
excuse to take profits,'' he said.
   Most observers remain optimistic that the market is just taking
a breather after the Dow's 200-point runup over the past two weeks.
   ``We're overdue for a pretty nice correction,'' Jensen said.
``Any setback would be the normal thing to expect.''
   Analysts expect some momentum to be generated by money managers
pressured to increase the equities in their portfolios supported
the market. With an unusually high amount of cash on hand, they are
looking to beef up their portfolios as the second quarter draws to
a close.
   As one trader said, ``They want to hop aboard the train before
it leaves the station.''
   Dealers said the market had little interest in government
reports that showed retail sales rose 0.1 percent and industrial
production rose 0.4 percent, both seasonally adjusted, in May.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down ~ at 49{. The oil
giant said its lawsuit against Carl Icahn charges the raider with
trying to purchase Texaco stock without making the required
disclosures.
   Zenith was up 2\ at 26|. The International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers said it is interested in bidding for some or all

<HEAD>Court Rules on Business Deal Promotion, Import Restriction Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The financial liability of promoters of
business deals that turn sour was expanded Wednesday by the Supreme
Court.
   The justices also ruled the government does not have to place
restrictions on imported uranium to help protect domestic producers
of the nuclear fuel.
   In the business deal promotion case, the court ruled a Texas
oilman might not have to bear full financial liability for selling
unregistered oil and gas leases. The court said a promoter of the
deal, who also bought the securities himself, might be forced to
share liability.
   The court, in a 7-1 decision, overturned a ruling that favored
the promoter and it ordered further lower court study of the case.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission had argued that promoters
who are not themselves sellers of securities should not be immune
from penalties in such cases.
   Billy ``B.J.'' Pinter, head of Black Gold Oil Co., had sold oil
and gas rights in Texas and Oklahoma to a group of investors in
1981. Maurice Dahl, a California real estate broker, helped put the
deal together.
   Dahl thought the leases would be lucrative and promoted their
sale to his friends and family members. When the leases proved
worthless, the investors _ including Dahl _ sued Pinter.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1986 that Pinter
violated federal law by failing to register the securities. The
appeals court upheld a federal judge's ruling that Pinter must
reimburse the investors for their losses plus interest.
   Pinter argued that Dahl, because he promoted the investment, was
himself a ``seller'' of securities who should be forced to share
the cost of reimbursement.
   The 5th Circuit court, noting that Dahl did not receive a
commission for promoting the deal, said he was more a buyer than a
seller.
   But the Supreme Court ordered further hearings to explore that
issue.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said there
must be further study to determine ``whether Dahl bears at least
substantially equal responsibility for the failure to register the
oil and gas interests or to distribute the securities in a manner
that conformed'' with federal law.
   He said there was conflicting evidence about Dahl's role in the
deal.
   A person in Dahl's position must share financial liability for
the sale of unregistered securities if his role was ``more as a
promoter than as an investor,'' Blackmun said.
   In the import case, the court overturned by unanimous vote a
decision barring federal officials from enriching foreign uranium,
particularly from Canada and Australia, for import into the United
States.
   Adminsitration officials had argued the ban jeopardized U.S.
trade, nuclear cooperation and non-proliferation policies and could
limit the supply of fuel used to run electric utility company
nuclear reactors.
   The decision reversed a ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals based in Denver, which said last year that the Department
of Energy must restrict enrichment of foreign uranium to safeguard
the deteriorating domestic industry.
   Blackmun, again writing for the court, said federal law did not
require the department to restrict enrichment unless it was assured
such action would maintain ``a viable domestic uranium industry.''
   Federal officials determined the industry had not been viable
since 1983.
   Uranium must be enriched to serve as nuclear fuel because in its
natural state it lacks an adequate concentration of a fissionable
material known as isotope U-235.
   The government has a monopoly in providing enrichment services
in this country, and federal officials said at least $300 million a
year in fees for enrichment services was at stake in the case.
   The Justice Department said restricting enriched uranium from
other countries could force up prices of electricity to consumers
here as supplies of the nuclear fuel dwindled.
   The government was opposed by three U.S. uranium producers,
Western Nuclear Inc., Energy Fuels Inc. and Uranium Resources Inc.
   The producers were supported by officials from Wyoming, New
Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and Nevada. They said their state
economies would be hurt by the collapse of the uranium industry.
   In two other rulings, the court:
   _Said Kansas courts could apply that state's laws in a natural
gas royalties dispute between an oil company and mineral rights
owners from five states.
   _Allowed Americans who sue foreign corporations to notify those
companies through their U.S. subsidiaries.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
dramatically higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with
nearly all contracts up their daily trading limits on continuing
dry-weather concerns.
   ``We're looking at the potential worst drought, the worst
disaster in history,'' said Steve Freed, an analyst in Chicago with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Fears of severe drought damage to corn and soybean crops
deepened during the trading session as a band of showers moving
into Illinois and Indiana weakened and produced only scattered
sprinkles, analysts said.
   The drought has begun to take a toll on the corn crop and could
reduce soybean yields if it continues into July, analysts
suggested. Oat and spring wheat crops have already suffered
irreversible damage.
   The exchange announced after the close of trading that it was
raising the daily price limit on corn futures from 10 cents to 15
cents a bushel.
   The higher limit will remain in effect for at least three
sessions in accordance with exchange rules, which require a 150
percent increase in limits following two consecutive days of
limit-up moves. Corn futures also traded limit-up on Tuesday.
   At the close, wheat was 14{ cents to 20 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was 10 cents
higher across the board with July at $2.79{ a bushel; oats were 10
cents higher across the board with July at $2.79\ a bushel;
soybeans were 26{ cents to 30 cents higher with July at $9.20 a
bushel.

<HEAD>EEC Proposes Scrapping Remaining Steel Quotas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
proposed Wednesday that steel production quotas in the 12-nation
trading bloc be eliminated on June 30.
   The EEC Commission said an improvement in demand and prices in
the European steel market would allow the quotas to be dropped
after eight years. The quota system was set up in 1980 to allow the
steel companies time to restructure their operations in face of a
worldwide surplus in steel production capacity.
   Despite the upturn in the steel industry, the commission said
its plan to return the steel sector to free competition would lead
to the loss of about 55,000 jobs over the next three years.
   The commission's proposal, which is to be discussed by industry
ministers on June 24, followed an informal agreement in May that
quotas for hot-rolled coil, which is used in the automobile
industry, and cold-rolled sheet should be abolished.
   The commission went further in proposing to also scrap quotas
for heavy plate, used mainly in shipbuilding, and for heavy
sections, sold to the construction industry.
   The quotas now prop up prices for about 40 percent of the bloc's
steel output, which amounted to 126.5 million metric tons in 1987.
   The commission said its plan to end the quotas also was in
response to the failure of the European steel industry to come
forward with cuts in production capacity amounting to about 15
million metric tons.
   Last December, the trade bloc extended the quotas for at least
six months on the condition steel companies make firm commitments
to shut down excess production capacity.
   The commission said the industry had not made any major
commitments to close 7.5 million tons of capacity for production of
hot-rolled coil and cold-rolled sheet as decided last December.
   This implied there ``was not a crisis in these sectors,'' the
commission said, noting that EEC steel mills were operating at a
high 77 percent of capacity and that prices were rising regularly.
   In the other two sectors _ heavy plate and heavy sections _
commitments to close capacity fell far short of the 6.9 million
tons earmarked in December, the commission said.
   However, it said capacity cuts in those two sectors were still
necessary as mills operated at a low 60 percent despite a rise in
prices.

heels of Tuesday's rally.
   Traders said there was some uncertainty in the market following
the sharp runup in the previous session, which was sparked by a

   ``Any setback would be the normal thing to expect,'' he said.
   Overall, however, the tone in the market was optimistic. Traders
said that money managers, who have an unusually high amount of cash

<HEAD>Takeshita Promises To Assert New Economic Strength At Toronto
Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Wednesday
Japan has now gained the status of an economic power, and it is his
responsibility to assert that role at the upcoming economic summit
in Toronto.
   Takeshita said his goals at the summit, which begins next week,
are to discuss cooperation on trade, resolving the problems of
international debt and restoring self-sustained growth to
developing countries.
   In advance of the meeting, which President Reagan and leaders of
five other nations will attend, Takeshita sounded unconcerned about
trade problems with the United States and ongoing talks to resolve
them. The prime minister said it is natural for the two countries
to occasionally disagree.
   ``We have come to share this deep relationship bilaterally and
it is natural that we should face a greater number of frictions,''
he said. ``As friction arises, we should address and resolve those
problems jointly.''
   However, he said ``all countries concerned, ourselves as well as
our trade partners, should be careful so that individual issues
will not lead to an unreasonable nationalism.''
   U.S. and Japanese officials have been haggling for months on
trade issues, including a prolonged dispute over opening Japanese
markets to more imports of American beef and oranges.
   The United States wants the total removal of the beef and citrus
import quotas it had accepted in a 1984 agreement that expired in
March. Japan has balked at the demand.
   Nearly two weeks ago, during a Reagan-Takeshita meeting in
London, U.S. officials praised Japan for the progress the country
has made in opening up its markets to American goods and boosting
domestic demand in its economy to narrow its trade surplus.
   The prime minister said Wednesday he is pleased with Japan's
growth rate, and noted that unemployment and inflation have been
kept down.
   ``Seen from the international perspective, it's fit that Japan
has gained the status of an economic power,'' Takeshita said,
adding, ``It is my responsibility to assert that strength'' at the
Toronto meeting.
   Leaders from West Germany, Canada, Britain, France and Italy
also will be at the summit.
   Takeshita said that at the gathering, he wants to discuss his
concerns about Asia's newly industrialized economies _ Hong Kong,
Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea _ and regional problems such as
Cambodia and the Philippines.
   He said Japan is considering further debt relief to
underdeveloped countries and would like to improve cooperation with
international financial institutions.
   Japan is the world's largest donor of overseas economic aid. In
the fiscal year ended March 31, it gave $7.4 billion to developing
countries.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said last week the government would
increase overseas aid if other nations need it.

<TEXT>
   Workers at Zenith Electronics Corp.'s
Springfield television manufacturing plant want to buy the factory,
but Zenith is blocking their bid, the employees' union charged
Wednesday.
   ``Zenith is actively talking with other bidders, including
foreign firms, but so far refuses even to provide its employees
with the financial information necessary to structure a bid,'' said
J.J. Barry, president of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
   Zenith spokesman John Taylor, reached by telephone at company
headquarters in Glenview, Ill., said he was aware of the IBEW's
charges but had no further comment. He would not confirm that the
Springfield plant is for sale.
   ``The management of Zenith has known of the employees's interest
(in buying the plant) since the beginning of April,'' Barry said.
``Now they have informed us that if allowed to bid, we will be
given less than one week to prepare an offer ....''
   Barry said corporate bidders have been negotiating with Zenith
since May. He asked Zenith to give the union more time to prepare
its own bid or a joint bid with another party.
   ``The employees should be given a fair opportunity to
participate in a process that will have an enormous effect on their
lives and welfare,'' Barry said.
   The Springfield plant is the only American manufacturer of
television sets. It employs more than 1,600 hourly workers.
   Zenith has suffered losses as a result of heavy foreign
competition. In an effort to save the Springfield plant last year,
members of IBEW Local 1453 approved a five-year contract that
called for an 8 percent cut in hourly pay.

   Bank of New York Co. sweetened its offer for
rival Irving Bank Corp. on Wednesday, slightly raising the stock
portion of the bid and adding other shareholder incentives,
including a special cash dividend.
   But some banking analysts predicted Irving management would
continue to snub its persistent suitor in favor of a friendly
merger with the state-run Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's
second-largest bank.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady valued the revised bid for
all of Irving's 18.5 million shares outstanding at around $1.4
billion, about 25 percent higher than the existing hostile $1.1
billion tender offer which remains in place.
   The new proposal is subject to approval from Irving's board of
directors and redemption of its anti-takeover ``poison pill,''
which would make an unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive.
   Irving had no comment on the latest bid, except to say that its
board of directors would consider it at its next meeting June 21.
The bid was presented during a 40-minute meeting Wednesday morning
between Irving Chairman Joseph Rice and Bank of New York Chairm J.
Carter Bacot.
   The meeting was scheduled after New York State Supreme Court
Justice Herman Cahn suggested the two banks attempt to bridge their
differences. Bank of New York has gone to court to invalidate
Irving's poison pill and overturn the results of a proxy battle in
which shareholders recently chose Irving's incumbent board over
Bank of New York's nominees.
   Bacot maintained that Bank of New York's new bid ``is clearly
superior'' to the Banca Commerciale offer, which has a blended
value of as much as much as $76.50 per share.
   Wall Street also acted positively. In trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, Irving jumped $3.87{ a share to $70.12{, while Bank
of New York fell 75 cents to $33.
   Bank of New York said its new offer, worth around $76 a share,
includes $15 in cash, 1.675 shares of its stock, a one-time $2.50
cash dividend and securities valued at up to $2.50 per share. The
securities promise to disburse profits from the sale of Irving's
Wall Street headquarters.
   The existing tender offer, which expires later this month, is
for $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of Bank of New York stock, or
around $64 a share.
   Banca Commerciale is offering $80 a share for 51 percent of
Irving, or about $760 million. The proposal is part of a complex
defensive restructuring plan that includes, among other things,
sale of Irving assets, cost-cutting measures and a special cash
dividend.
   Analysts weren't surprised Bank of New York upped the stakes in
the 9-month-old takeover saga since its existing hostile bid was
having little success with shareholders and management. But some
questioned whether it would do any good.
   ``Just reading through the lines the fact that Irving's formal
response was that its board of directors would meet next week seems
to indicate they're somewhat cool to the offer,'' said Michael
Starr, of Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``If they were truly
interested, they would have looked into it much sooner than that.''
   Virginia Adair of Merrill & Lynch Co. agreed that Irving
remained committed to keeping its current management intact, which
would happen through a merger with Banca Commerciale, not Bank of
New York.
   ``I think Irving will be hoping BCI will raise its offer,'' she
said.
   But Starr said, ``At this point in time I don't see any reason
for BCI to increase its offer. However, if some of those court
cases are won by Bank of New York, BCI would have to increase its
offer to remain competitive.''
   He said on the surface, Bank of New York's bid appears slightly
more attractive because it offers shareholders tax advantages that
Banca Commerciale doesn't and already has received regulatory
approval.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Narrowly Mixed; Gold Rises Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed narrowly mixed Wednesday as it
picked up some strength from Tuesday's positive trade deficit news
but also began to mark time in advance of next week's economic
summit.
   Gold prices were slightly higher. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid price of $451.75 for a troy ounce of gold, up
from $450.15 late Tuesday.
   Trading was quiet on the foreign-exchange markets, but a bullish
sentiment about the dollar remained following Tuesday's trade
report, said Dan Holland, a trader with Discount Corp.
   ``Most people believe the dollar has bottomed,'' Holland said.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the nation's
merchandise trade deficit narrowed in April to $9.89 billion, the
lowest monthly deficit in more than three years. The report set off
a strong rally in the dollar on Tuesday.
   On Wednesday, the government reported that the deficit in the
broadest measure of U.S. foreign trade, the current account,
widened in the first three months of the year to $39.75 billion.
The news had no effect on dollar trading, Holland said.
   The current account includes merchandise trade and trade in
services, which reflects primarily the flow of investment earnings
between countries.
   Varick Martin, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland's
New York office, said the dollar was expected to remain at its
current levels or perhaps drift through the end of the economic
summit in Toronto.
   No new developments were expected from the gathering, which will
bring together President Reagan and the leaders of six other major
industrial nations, Martin said.
   ``Everything's been reached ...,'' he said. ``They're pleased
with the dollar's stability.''
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance against the Japanese
yen Wednesday. It closed at 126.32 yen in Tokyo, up from 125.05
late Tuesday, but it slipped in later London trading to 126.25 yen.
In New York, it edged down to 126.35 yen from 126.54 yen late
Tuesday.
   The British pound slipped against the dollar in London. It cost
$1.7848 late Wednesday, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late
$1.7925. But the pound gained slightly against the dollar in New
York, where sterling was quoted at $1.7868, up from $1.7863.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.75425 West German marks, up from
1.74955; 1.46785 Swiss francs, up from 1.4626; 5.9110 French
francs, up from 5.8970; 1,298.50 Italian lire, up from 1,297.50;
and 1.2150 Canadian dollars, down from 1.21825.
   Other late rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates,
included: 1.7535 West German marks, up from 1.7460; 1.4675 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4615; 5.9137 French francs, up from 5.8840;
1.9690 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9600; 1,300.62 Italian lire, up
from 1,292.50; 1.2170 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2162.
   Gold closed at $451.90 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, up from $450.15 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, gold bullion closed in London, the major European
trading center for the metal, at a bid price of $452.60 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $448. In Zurich, Switzerland, the late bid
price was $453, up from $448.
   The Hong Kong gold market was closed for a holiday.
   Silver bullion closed at $7.129 a troy ounce on the Commodity
Exchange, up from $7.0420 late Tuesday. Silver traded late in
London at a bid price of $7.14 a troy ounce, up from $6.91.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Soar, Livestock Futures Plunge on Dry Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean prices shot up the daily maximum Wednesday,
while livestock and meat futures fell their limits as the drought
continued to weigh heavily on the nation's commodities markets.
   Worries about crops shortfalls spurred the latest rise in grain
prices, while livestock traders feared their market could be
flooded if herds had to be reduced extensively because of feed
shortages.
   On other markets, cotton futures soared; energy futures slumped;
precious metals advanced; and stock-index futures rose slightly.
   Nearly all contracts for future delivery of grains, soybeans and
soybean products shot up their daily limits early in the session on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Fears of drought damage to corn and soybean crops deepened as a
band of showers moving into Illinois and Indiana weakened and
produced only scattered sprinkles, analysts said.
   The drought has begun to take a toll on the corn crop and could
reduce soybean yields if it continues into July, analysts said. Oat
and spring wheat crops already have suffered irreversible damage.
   ``I'm having a little trouble quantifying the worst drought in
60 years _ I'm only 30 years old,'' said Steve Freed, an analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``We're looking at the
potential worst drought, the worst disaster in history.''
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new 6-to
10-day forecast calling for below-normal rainfall in the Grain Belt
in the middle and latter portions of next week.
   The Board of Trade announced after the close that it was raising
the daily price limit on corn futures from 10 cents to 15 cents a
bushel.
   The higher limit will remain in effect for at least three
sessions in accordance with exchange rules, which require a 50
percent increase in limits following two consecutive days of
maximum price moves. Corn futures also rose the maximum on Tuesday.
   Wheat settled 12 cents to 20 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was 10 cents higher across
the board, with July at $2.79{ a bushel; oats also were 10 cents
higher in all contracts, with July at $2.79\ a bushel; and soybeans
were 27 cents to 30 cents higher, with July at $9.20 a bushel.
   Many livestock and meat futures plunged their daily limits on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where traders feared the high cost
of feed grains would prompt widespread liquidation of cattle and
hog herds if the dry weather continued.
   Livestock producers already have begun reducing their herds by
sending more animals to market, which increases the supply of meat,
said Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago.
   But widespread herd liquidation this year would be followed by
tight supplies of meat _ and sharply higher prices _ next year
because of a corresponding drop in births, Levitt said.
   ``The factors that are driving the grain and soybean complex
higher are the same exact factors forcing the livestock markets
lower,'' he said. ``You are creating a catastrophic situation as
far as the herd is concerned by continuing this drought.''
   Cattle and hog futures are limited to daily moves of 1{ cents a
pound, while frozen pork belly futures have a 2-cent limit.
   Live cattle settled 1.50 cents lower to .05 cent higher, with
the June delivery contract at 70.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were 1.50 cents lower across the board, with August at 71.77 cents
a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower to .55 cent higher, with June
at 49.15 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.72 cents to
2 cents lower, with July at 44.47 cents a pound.
   Dry-weather fears also propelled most cotton futures up the
daily limit of 2 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
July cotton settled 2 cents higher at 68.91 cents a pound.
   Energy futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in a reversal of Tuesday's gains.
   Analyst Robert Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said
the swing reflected uncertainty whether OPEC members would abide by
their crude-oil production quotas.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 30 cents to 35 cents
lower, with the July contract at $16.53 a barrel; heating oil was
.54 cent to 1.06 cents lower, with July at 43.42 cents a gallon;
and unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to .95 cent lower, with July at
49.23 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures advanced on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the soaring grain prices, but gains were
limited by the drop in crude-oil prices, the strength of the dollar
and a smaller than expected rise in retail sales last month,
analysts said.
   Gold settled $1.20 to $1.50 higher, with the August contract at
$455.80 a troy ounce; and silver was 8.5 cents to 8.9 cents higher,
with July at $7.155 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures rose slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled .20 point higher at 274.80.

   Frank Borman, a former astronaut and Eastern
Airlines president, on Wednesday was named chairman and chief
executive officer of Patlex Corp., a high-technology manufacturer
and laser company.
   Borman, 60, was appointed as Patlex announced plans to spin off
its manufacturing operations into a new company. Borman, who flew
Gemini and Apollo missions for NASA and went on to head Eastern
until its sale to Texas Air Corp. two years ago, has been a member
of the Patlex board of directors.
   Patlex has a 64 percent interest in laser patents held by its
vice president, Gordon Gould, inventor of the technology. Those
patent rights, gained through litigation begun in 1979, cover a
significant percentage of the lasers used in the United States, the
company said.
   To be spun off are Oram Electric Industries Ltd., which makes
transformers for the telecommunications, defense and computer
industries; Reshef Defense Technologies Ltd., which produces
electronic gear for the military; and Apollo Lasers Inc., which
makes scientific and small systems lasers.
   The manufacturing group had $13 million in sales last year,
while laser royalties brought in $4.5 million, said Yaron Eitan,
Patlex executive vice president.
   Patlex shareholders would receive one share of stock in the new
company for each two shares of Patlex stock they hold.
   The spin-off is intended to separate the laser patent licensing
activity from the manufacturing business, which requires additional
capital to finance growth, said Richard Samuel, the former Patlex
chairman and chief executive officer who will be chairman of the
new company. Samuel will be Patlex president.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Belzbergs in Bid for Ashland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Belzberg family's financial company
violated federal securities law in its unsuccessful bid to take
control of Ashland Oil Co. and must forfeit $2.7 million in stock
profits, a judge ruled Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker held that First City
Financial Corp. Ltd. ``with an excess of boldness'' deliberately
violated federal securities law by failing to make timely
disclosures that it had purchased 5 percent of Ashland's stock.
   Parker found that First City, through a subsidiary headed by
Marc Belzberg, circumvented the disclosure requirement by arranging
to acquire the bulk of its 1.4 million Ashland shares by
``parking'' its stock with the brokerage firm Bear Stearns & Co.
Inc.
   The judge said he would grant an injunction barring Belzberg and
his family's Canadian-based company from engaging in further
``stock parking'' arrangements to conceal ownership of securities.
   He also ordered First City to give up $2.7 million in profits it
made in the stock transactions that violated Section 13 (d) of the
1934 Securities Exchange Act.
   The decision was hailed as a significant victory by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which contends that ``stock
parking'' should be treated as a serious problem despite
contentions by many on Wall Street that it is only a minor,
technical violation.
   Parker said First City's ``surreptitious effort to accumulate a
block of shares in Ashland is the precise type of evil Section
13(d) was directed to prevent.''
   The requirement is designed to prevent companies involved in
takeovers from continuing to acquire shares of a company's stock at
artificially low prices by concealing large purchases from other
investors.
   ``We regard it as a terrific victory,'' said Thomas C. Newkirk,
the SEC's chief litigation counsel. ``Its importance goes beyond
the facts of this particular case because it shows the seriousness
with which Judge Parker treated the violations which we proved,''
he said.
   Newkirk said the judgment marked the first time the SEC had
taken enforcement action under the disclosure provision of the 1934
law.
   The decision is also significant because of the SEC's
investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. One focus of the
Drexel probe is the allegation that the investment firm's junk bond
chief, Michael Milken, engaged in a stock parking scheme with
former speculator and insider-trader Ivan Boesky.
   Milken is represented by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
Garrison, the same New York law firm that defended Mark Belzberg in
the trial before Parker last year in U.S. District Court. Belzberg
was represented by Arthur L. Liman, counsel to the Senate
Iran-Contra committee.
   The judge rejected Belzberg's testimony that a Bear Stearns
executive misunderstood a March 4, 1986 conversation which led to
the immediate purchase of 20,500 shares of Ashland on behalf of
First City. The broker testified that he undertood he had been
directed to purchase the stock for Belzberg and continued to do so.
   Following that purchase, First City owned more than 5 percent of
Ashland Oil and had 10 days to make that disclosure.
   But Parker found that Bear Stearns, which was not charged with
wrongdoing, continued to purchase more shares of Ashland stock for
First City, which did not disclose its 5 percent interest in the
oil company until March 26, 12 days after the legal deadline for
making the report.
   First City, headed by Marc Belzberg's father, Canadian
businessman Samuel Belzberg, dropped its bid to take over Ashland,
but made a $15.4 million profit when it sold its shares back to the
oil company.
   Parker calculated that First City should forfeit $2.7 million in
profits on the 890,000 shares it purchased during the period when
its 5 percent stake in Ashland should have been public knowledge.
   ``We are obviously deeply disappointed by the court's decision.
We fought because we believed the SEC was wrong in the facts and
the law. We still believe that and we intend to appeal,'' the
company said in a statement issued by its Toronto office.
   In April, First City agreed to pay a $400,000 fine to settle a
Federal Trade Commission complaint that its Ashland bid had
violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law. The FTC complaint
alleged that First City failed to notify the agency of Ashland
stock purchases exceeding $15 million.

<HEAD>Slower Retail Sales Growth in May Seen as Helping Ease Inflation
Fears</HEAD>

   Retail sales grew a lackluster 0.1 percent in
May, the government said Wednesday in a report analysts predicted
should help ease fears of inflationary pressures in the economy.
   The Commerce Department said sales by retailers, which represent
about one-third of U.S. economic activity, edged up a scant 0.1
percent in May to $131.9 billion, after a 0.4 percent drop in April.
   Much of the slowdown came from two successive drops in auto
sales, but other categories, including department store sales, also
were anemic.
   ``If you put the two months together, there is not much evidence
of strength,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with The Futures
Group, a Washington-based consulting firm. ``Department store
sales, which are a major barometer, continue to be very weak.''
   But Shaber and other analysts said slack consumer spending,
while bad for retailers, is good for the economy as a whole because
it should calm the inflation jitters that had troubled financial
markets earlier this year.
   Economists have been looking toward rising export sales as a
cure for the swollen U.S. trade deficit. However, retail sales
jumps of 1.6 percent in March and 1.1 percent in February fueled
concern that prices would rise as manufacturers found it difficult
to meet demand from both forign and American consumers.
   ``Following the February and March surge, retail sales have
settled into a comfortable tempo. ... This should allay fears that
Americans are indulging in an orgy of overconsumption which will
make it impossible to drive down the trade deficit,'' Richard W.
Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a
statement.
   Two other reports issued Wednesday fit the pattern of a shift
from consumer-led growth to an export-driven economy.
   The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose a moderate 0.4 percent in May,
the eighth consecutive month without a decline.
   Economists said the increase was evidence that manufacturers
continue to produce more goods for export. Production of business
equipment was particularly robust, the Fed said. As part of the
export boom, businesses are spending more to modernize and expand
their factories.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said a 9.8 percent climb in
exports in the first three months of 1988 from the previous quarter
helped shrink the merchandise trade deficit by 12.7 percent to
$35.9 billion.
   However, the current account _ the broadest measure of U.S.
transactions with other nations _ widened by a sharp 18.6 percent
to $39.75 billion as the United States recorded its first quarterly
deficit in investment earnings in 30 years.
   On Wall Street, stock prices rose as the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials edged up 6.93 to 2,131.40, its second post-October
crash high in as many days. The dollar was mixed and bond prices
edged lower.
   ``The retail sales report is painting a picture of a slowdown in
consumption from the first quarter, but this is something that is
good for the economy,'' said Tom Megan, senior financial economist
with Evans Economics in Washington. ``As the current account
numbers point out, we have to reorient the economy from consuming
to exporting.''
   It was the sixth increase in retail sales in seven months, but
it was the second consecutive weak report.
   And, because the figures are not adjusted for inflation, Megan
said strong sales totals in two categories _ food and specialty
clothing _ likely reflect price increases rather than actual gains
in sales volume.
   Sales in May were held back by a 1.2 percent fall in automotive
sales to $29.3 billion. That followed a 0.8 percent drop in April.
   Excluding autos, sales rose 0.5 percent in May following a 0.3
percent decline.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, were down 0.6 percent in May, while
non-durable goods were up 0.5 percent.
   The Commerce Department offered these details of May sales:
   _Department and other general merchandise stores, down 0.1
percent, after a 1.2 drop in April.
   _Hardware and garden supply stores, up 0.2 percent after no
change in April.
   _Furniture and appliance stores, down 0.2 percent, following a
strong 1.3 percent jump a month earlier.
   _Food and grocery stores, up 1.3 percent after a 0.1 percent
drop.
   _Gasoline, up 0.6 percent after a 0.7 percent decline.
   _Specialty clothing stores, up 1.7 percent; restaurants and
bars, down 0.5 percent; and drug stores, up 0.4 percent.

   Iowa cattle farmers mowed roadside ditches for feed Wednesday
and hundreds of Mississippi River barges backed up in low water at
Greenville, Miss., as the drought in the nation's midsection pushed
prices skyward on commodity exchanges.
   Rain fell in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois, but the National
Weather Service said it wouldn't be enough to make up for weeks of
dry weather. Temperatures remained in the high 80s and 90s across
much of the nation.
   ``We're not looking for a great deal of shower activity, not
enough to significantly alleviate the drought situation,'' said
weather service meteorologist Lyle Alexander in Kansas City, Mo.
   Tinder-dry conditions in some areas of Wisconsin prompted
officials to impose a strict burning ban, while residents of a
northern Ohio community hired a Sioux Indian medicine man to
perform a rain dance for withering fields.
   With the drought threatening farm yields, Ohio State University
agricultural economist Scott Erwin said food prices would likely
rise faster this year than in any of the previous five years. He
predicted a 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent increase later this year and
even larger price boosts in 1989 if the drought persists.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng's gloomy assessment
of the drought on Tuesday sparked buying interest Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices for future delivery of soybeans,
corn and oats rocketed to their limits for daily trading within
seconds of the opening bell.
   Lyng told lawmakers that the drought could turn into a national
disaster. He said damage had already been done to wheat fields in
Montana and the Dakotas and that additional weeks of scorching
temperatures and no rain could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt
and across the South.
   ``Those statements by Lyng were on traders' minds,'' said Walter
Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New
York. ``There's just a general bullishness (in the grain markets)
and no one wants to miss it.''
   In Iowa, a dry winter followed by a dry spring has already
created a crisis for livestock farmers who are sending pregnant
cows to slaughter.
   ``For cattle producers, things are critical. As far as the corn
and bean crop, it's kind of borderline right now. We're probably
looking at a reduction in yields,'' said Peter Brent, who operates
a hot line for troubled farmers that was started during the farm
debt crisis of the 1980s.
   Pastures have yielded little feed because of the drought, and
Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad ordered the state highway department to
allow farmers to mow ditches along roads near their property and
feed the hay to livestock.
   Across Illinois, parched communities have imposed water-use
restrictions.
   ``Over hundreds and hundreds of miles, the ground is very, very
dry,'' said Peter Lamb of the Illinois State Water Survey. ``So
what the sun is doing is heating the ground and the ground is
heating the air.''
   C.D. Besadny, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources, said an emergency burning order would ban all outside
fires, including cigarette smoking, in parts of the state,
beginning Saturday.
   ``It won't be lifted until we get sufficient rain,'' Besadny
said. ``This is the driest I've seen the state in a long, long
time.''
   Dry conditions caused 87 fires that burned 250 acres in
Wisconsin on Tuesday, another state official said.
   Florist Cliff Doebel of the northern Ohio community of Clyde
said he had persuaded Leonard Crow Dog from the Rosebud Indians
Reservation in South Dakota to come to his town to perform a rain
dance ceremony beginning Sunday.
   ``Crow Dog will use prayers and offerings to appeal to the four
winds of the Earth to bring the rain to Sandusky County,'' Doebel
said.
   Ohio was also the site of a prayer service in a parched farm
field on Tuesday. About 225 people gathered at the farm of Gerald
and Joanne Lowery south of Fostoria in the northwest part of the
state for the interdenominational service.
   The Rev. William Martin of St. Wendelin Roman Catholic shook
holy water at the crops in all four directions as he gave a
blessing of the field.
   The next two weeks are considered a critical growing period for
Midwestern crops, and without rainfall approaching its normal 4
inches in June, crop yields will suffer, farm experts say.
   Near Greenville, Miss., aAbout 750 barges were backed up on the
Mississippi River on Wednesday because of low water, and the Army
Corps of Engineers said twice as many could be stranded by the
weekend.
   The barges began backing up after one ran aground Monday and
others decided to wait for a dredge to arrive Thursday to deepen
the channel.
   ``They are skittish about using it because one mess-up costs
lots of dollars,'' said Michael Logue, spokesman for the corps'
Vicksburg District.
   Ron Goldman, chief of water control management for the Vicksburg
District, said the Mississippi is at its lowest point for this time
of year since records were first kept in 1872.
   He said the Vicksburg gauge read 2.5 feet on Tuesday. The lowest
level on record is minus 7 feet in February 1940, when much of the
upper river froze solid.

   The stock market finished higher Wednesday as a
spurt of buying minutes before the close helped to solidify the
sharp gains posted in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which jumped 25 points
Tuesday, managed to inch past that level by 6.93 points to close at
2,131.40, its second post-crash high in as many days.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
772 issues up, 669 down and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 150.26 million shares,
down from 227.15 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
175.70 million shares.
   The market was expected to retreat as traders cashed in on
Tuesday's runup, which was sparked by a better-than-expected trade
report for April.
   ``We're overdue for a pretty nice correction,'' said Charles
Jensen, chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp., who noted
that the Dow has climbed 200 points in the past few weeks.
   The market was off for most of the session, mirroring some
softness in the bond market, but some traders were surprised it did
not move lower. At the day's low, the Dow was off only about 6
points.
   Analysts said the profit-taking that occurred appeared light and
orderly throughout the session, and most agreed it would not harm
the so-called summer rally.
   ``There was some pausing and some restraint rather than any
heavy profit-taking,'' said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
   ``The selling pressure is quite low,'' he noted. ``Volume dries
up considerably when any selling comes in.''
   The overall tone in the market remained cautiously optimistic.
Traders said that money managers, who have an unusually high amount
of cash on hand, are under pressure to purchase equities for their
portfolios before the end of the quarter.
   These institutional investors have had little opportunity to
jump into the market over the last few weeks and are anxious to
``get money into the market,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of
technical market analysis at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   ``That momentum will keep the market rallying moderately
higher,'' he said.
   Dealers said the market had little interest in government
reports that showed retail sales rose 0.1 percent and industrial
production rose 0.4 percent, both seasonally adjusted, in May.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down { at 49~. Rumors
were circulating about whether proxies were traded along with the
7.7-million-share block of Texaco stock that changed hands Tuesday.
It was not known whether Carl Icahn, who is trying to acquire the
oil giant, orchestrated the purchase.
   Zenith was up 2} at 27[. The International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers said it is interested in bidding for some or all
of the company's consumer electronics division through an employee
stock ownership plan.
   Elsewhere, IBM was up [ at 118~, General Electric was down \ at
43{, Woolworth was up 2 at 54~, Hewlett Packard was off 2 at 53],
and General Motors was up { at 80[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased by $2.299 billion, or
0.08 percent, in value.
   The NYSE index was up 0.15 at 154.67.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 0.26 to 317.36,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.15 to 274.45.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index finished
at 308.78, off 0.10. The NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market closed at 389.08, up 0.55.

   Keeney Tobacco Corp. will begin making a
new risk-reducing cigarette on Aug. 1, the company announced
Wednesday.
   ``We need all the help we can get,'' said L. Douglas Keeney,
chairman and chief executive officer of Keeney, a subsidiary of CA.
Blockers Inc. ``A lot of people are suffering illnesses as a result
of the risks of smoking, our surgeon general says.''
   Keeney said the company expects to produce 2 billion cigarettes
during its first manufacturing phase, a figure that has doubled due
to an increase in firm orders.
   The cigarette contains an additive called N-BLOCTIN, a cleansing
alcohol that absorbs and eliminates the undesirable nitrosamines in
the smokestream.
   The cigarette reduces the risks for both the smoker and those
breathing the smoke, Keeney said.
   ``We learned how to make the cigarette back in December,''
Keeney said. ``And I'll tell you, we made a vile cigarette.
   ``Our mandate ... was it must conform to the behavioral form and
to the sensory pleasures smokers seek in smoking.''
   The company, which offers contract production for generic brand
and private label cigarettes, will make the risk-reducing cigarette
at its manufacturing plant in Petersburg, Va., according to a news
release.
   Keeney Tobacco will manufacture the risk-reducing cigarette for
Optima Ltd. of Jerusalem and Cigarretta La Moderna of Monterrey,
Mexico.
   The company has not yet disclosed its plans for U.S.
distribution, Keeney said in an interview.
   ``International tobacco sales are up 40 percent for the first
quarter of 1988,'' Keeney said in the statement. ``It's obvious
that the key overseas marketing is the `Made in U.S.A.' label. Our
fundamental strategy is to maximize our profits in this area.''

   Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co., which
tried to stave off a hostile takeover by AB Electrolux, now wants
the Swedish company to increase its bid.
   Murray officials said a buyout by AB Electrolux would be
considered and weighed with other offers for the manufacturer by a
deadline of Friday at 5 p.m. EDT.
   ``One of the possible alternatives which Murray would like to
investigate as part of this process would be an acquisition of
Murray by Electrolux if Electrolux is prepared to offer terms which
are more attractive,'' Murray said in a letter attached to a
statement filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   However, Murray officials said no decision to sell the company
has been made.
   Takeover analysts said Wednesday the letter indicates Murray has
received offers higher than Electrolux's $52-a-share bid and wants
the company to increase its bid.
   Officials with Electrolux in Nashville said the firm had no
comment on Murray's request.
   The Brentwood, Tenn.-based bicycle and lawn mower manufacturer
has twice rejected a bid from Electrolux to purchase of the
company. The latest offer from Electrolux was for $197 million.
   Electrolux raised its bid to $52 a share on May 23 after a U.S.
District Court denied Murray's attempts to block the takeover.

<HEAD>Ranch Is Run By Non-Family Director For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legendary South Texas King Ranch is
being run by a non-family member for the first time since its
founding in 1853 by Richard King, the Rio Grande steamboat captain.
   Darwin Smith, chairman and chief executive of Irving,
Texas-based Kimberly-Clark Corp., famous for Huggies diapers and
Kleenex, now holds the reins as chairman and president of the
privately held ranch. He will continue to head Kimberly-Clark.
   Smith says he's looking forward to the new job.
   ``The family has really dedicated itself to staying together and
not going down the other path that gets so divisive it breaks up
the operation,'' he said.
   The ranch is the largest in the United States, with more than
800,000 acres, including parts of six counties between Harlingen
and Corpus Christi.
   The company also operates a thoroughbred horse farm in Kentucky,
a farm in central Florida, and ranches in Brazil and Australia.
   King Ranch stock is held by about 100 people, all descendants by
blood or marriage of King and his son-in-law, Robert Justus Kleberg.
   Like many other ranches and farms, King Ranch has experienced
lean times in recent years. It has seen big drops in royalties from
its oil and gas holdings. In Texas, the company has reduced
employment from about 700 in 1984 to about 300 today. It employs
900 people worldwide. The company has sold land in Pennsylvania,
Spain, Venezuela and Argentina.
   Recently, King Ranch has been trying to diversify away from
dependence on cattle and horse raising, starting a shrimp farm on
its Texas coastal land and converting its Florida land to raising
sugar cane.
   Smith said he will provide policy direction and not be involved
in day-to-day operations.
   ``With the kind of skilled people they have down there, my job
is simply a matter of running a board of directors,'' he said.
   In another move at the meeting last weekend, the shareholders
voted to change the makeup of the board of directors, switching
from a 12-person board dominated by family members to a four-person
board with no family connections.

   Two former employees accused by Volkswagen
of America of profiting from irregular currency transactions with
company funds alleged in a countersuit that the company has defamed
them.
   The suit filed Tuesday in Oakland County, Mich., Circuit Court
holds that the Volkswagen accusations caused Nicholas Carucci and
his wife, Donna Marie Carucci, emotional and physical anguish and
cost Nicholas Carucci a subsequent job with Atari Corp.
   The Caruccis are asking for unspecified damages. Both their suit
and the suit filed against them by Volkswagen are assigned to
Oakland County Circuit Judge Steven N. Andrews.
   Nicholas Carucci, who was Volkswagen of America's manager of
Group Banking Operations, and Mrs. Carucci, who was an executive
secretary in the company's legal department, resigned on May 25.
   The company had filed a lawsuit May 24 accusing the couple of
using company funds in irregular currency transactions.
   The company asked for unspecified damages, and asked the court
to rule that the Caruccis breached the terms of their employment
and could properly be dismissed.
   Volkswagen officials estimated the company lost millions of
dollars in currency exchange schemes from 1984 to 1987 through a
Hungarian bank that allegedly resulted in profits that were
transferred to accounts in Liechtenstein.
   A Liechtenstein court entered an order March 28 seizing
Carucci's assets.
   The transactions allegedly were related to currency futures
frauds estimated by Volkswagen _ West Germany's largest automaker
and parent of Volkswagen of America _ to have cost the company
about $287 million.
   In the countersuit, the Caruccis deny the allegations.
   They claim Nicholas Carucci was defamed during a May 24 meeting
with Volkswagen attorney Noel Gage and several company officials in
which Carucci allegedly was accused of participating in illegal
activities for personal gain.

<HEAD>Air Force Offers Good Contractors Fewer Inspections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Air Force on Wednesday announced the start
of an initiative aimed at rewarding defense contractors with good
performance records by reducing the amount of formal inspection and
oversight they face.
   The ``Reduced Oversight Initiative'' will begin with a test at
three major contractors, the Air Force said in a statement. The
number of formal reviews by Air Force inspectors at those
contractors' plants will be cut by about 15 percent.
   The contractors selected for the test include Boeing Co. in
Seattle; Rockwell International Corp.'s Autonetics Division in
Anaheim, Calif.; and United Technology Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney
Manufacturing Division in East Hartford, Conn.
   The initiative ``will allow contractors more self-governance
responsibility for functions presently monitored by on-site Air
Force personnel,'' the service said.
   ``We have a high degree of confidence that the contractors
selected for this test program will continue producing quality
hardware,'' added Maj. Gen. Bernard L. Weiss, commander of the Air
Force Contract Management Division.

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Extend Ban On S&Ls Leaving FSLIC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Wednesday to extend for one
year a ban on savings and loan associations leaving the financially
threatened Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   By a voice vote, senators approved legislation aimed at blocking
healthy savings and loan associations from converting to savings
banks in order to escape the premiums assessed by FSLIC. The
current moratorium is due to expire Aug. 10.
   The extension was attached to a bill directing the Treasury
Department to mint commemorative coins celebrating the 200th
anniversary of Congress in 1989. The $50 million that the sale of
those coins is estimated to yield would be used to renovate the
Capitol.
   The bill was approved, 96-0.
   Also attached to the bill were amendments:
   _Requiring the Treasury Department to mint a new series of coins
for general circulation to replace existing designs. Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., sponsor of the amendment, cited estimates that
the sale of the new coins would produce a $200 million profit over
the next several years, which would be used to reduce the federal
deficit.
   _Directing the minting of a new $1 coin to mark the 100th
anniversary of the birth of the late President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   _Authorizing the minting of 350,000 $5 coins to honor six states
_ North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho and
Wyoming _ that will celebrate their centennials next year.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had asked for an extension of
the moratorium on conversions of savings and loan associations
following the collapse of large institutions in Texas and
California.
   A similar bill is pending in the House.
   Financial experts have expressed fear that a rush by healthy
institutions to leave FSLIC could result in taxpayers having to pay
$50 billion or more over the next few years to rescue remaining
savings and loan associations.
   By an 80-15 vote the Senate killed an amendment by Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., to require FSLIC to base its premiums on risks
faced by individual savings and loan associations.

<HEAD>Attorney Says Too Many Questions Remain To Approve $276 Million
Deal</HEAD>

   A federal judge on Wednesday took under
advisement a request to delay a proposed $276 million settlement of
a giant lawsuit resulting from the Washington Public Power Supply
System's default on $2.25 billion in bonds.
   U.S. District Judge William Browning took the matter under
advisement after hearing arguments from an attorney representing
investors holding more than $40 million in bonds that the proposal
failed to show how the settlement would be divided.
   ``It's not unnatural for a holder to wonder what a holder is
going to obtain in a settlement,'' said Ann Acker of Chicago,
representing two institutional investors and a bank holding the
bonds issued to finance two abandoned nuclear plants.
   But other attorneys for plaintiffs and defendants said the
proposed settlement was fair and would provide 27,000 bondholders
and claimants a payoff after years of waiting, while allowing
defendants to escape further litigation.
   ``We hope to buy peace,'' said Herbert Wachtell of New York,
representing bond underwriters, who would pay $92 million of the
$276 million.
   Ms. Acker, of the law firm of Chapman and Cutler, told the court
that a delay was proper because there had been no discussion on how
the settlement proceeds would be allocated among the different
classes of plaintiffs, including original investors and speculators
who bought bonds at reduced rates after the 1983 default, or how
much legal fees would be.
   Defendants tentatively settling so far include more than 50
utilities, underwriters, a legal adviser to WPPSS and WPPSS
directors.
   Trial against the remaining defendants is scheduled to begin
Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz., and could last two years. Remaining
defendants include utilities holding 80 percent interest in the
plants, engineers, WPPSS advisers and the supply system itself.
   Though the defaulted bonds totaled $2.25 billion in value,
claims by bondholders and by former bondholders with fraud claims
cover only about $1.5 billion of the bonds.
   Ms. Acker, representing Kemper Financial Services, Continental
Assurance and First Midwest Bancorp, was the only attorney arguing
against the partial settlement.
   Paul Bernstein of New York, a lead counsel for plaintiffs, said
the settlement was fair. He said Browning could decide on legal
fees when lawyers submitted their proposed bills to him.
   Browning has ruled that under state securities law the plaintiff
attorneys must prove defendants intended to defraud investors, and
were not simply negligent.
   However, the judge also has said plaintiffs would be allowed to
claim fraud and negligent misrepresentation, a lesser standard of
proof, under state common law.
   The supply system attempted to build five nuclear power plants
in the 1970s, including the two abandoned plants.
   One operating plant started up in late 1984, while two others
were mothballed while only partially complete. Those three plants
are being paid for through regional power rates levied by the
federal Bonneville Power Administration.
   The abandoned plants, over which the suits were filed, were not
included in the financial arrangement with BPA.
