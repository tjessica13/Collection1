   David Schoenbrun, 73, a war correspondent who
was recruited for CBS News by Edward R. Murrow, died Monday of
heart failure. He was 73.
   Schoenbrun was introduced to Murrow by Gen. Dwight Eisenhower in
Algiers at the end of World War II.
   Schoenbrun had gone to Europe in 1941 with the War Information
Office as an editor. He joined the Army in 1943 and covered the
invasion of southern France in 1944. Murrow hired Schoenbrun as
Paris correspondent. He was Paris bureau chief from 1947 until 1961.
   Schoenbrun later served in Washington, D.C., as CBS' main
political correspondent.

   Dino Grandi, who lost out to Benito Mussolini in a
1921 bid for leadership of the Fascist Party and helped depose the
dictator in 1943, died Saturday at age 92.
   Grandi fought in World War I and joined the fascist squads that
terrorized the Italian countryside. He failed to win the leadership
of the fascists at a national congress in 1921 but successfully
made a bid for a seat in Parliament.
   He participated in the October 1922 march on Rome that led to
Mussolini's installation as head of government. Grandi served as
undersecretary of the interior in 1924 and was foreign minister
from 1929 to 1934.

   The producers of a Broadway play about arms
control negotiations brought their performance to Congress on
Monday night, where it was viewed by an appreciative audience that
included the secretary of state and two men involved in such talks.
   ``It bore no resemblance to reality, that's what made it so
good,'' said Secretary of State George Shultz after viewing ``A
Walk in the Woods.'' ``It was a good characterization and a lot of
laughs,'' he said.
   The play, starring Sam Waterston as the American negotiator and
Robert Prosky as his Soviet counterpart, was performed in the
Library of Congress auditorium, across the street from the Capitol.
   A dozen senators, having just finished a day of debate about the
U.S.-Soviet medium-range arms control treaty, were among the 250
people who attended the play, along with Shultz, Paul Nitze and
Maynard Glitman.
   Nitze was the American who formed the basis of Waterston's
character, while Glitman was the chief U.S. negotiator on the
medium-range missile treaty.
   Nitze and Glitman agreed with Shultz.
   ``It didn't bear any relationship to anything we talked about,''
said Nitze.
   ``It's a dramatization, and while it's good, it's not like
reality,'' said Glitman.
   The play, a black comedy, is based on Nitze's 1982 private talk
with Yuri Kvitsinsky, Nitze's Soviet counterpart. That discussion
produced an agreement between the two men on the framework for a
medium-range missile treaty, but the plan was later rejected by
both governments.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said he thought the production ``dramatizes the human
side of what is too often a faceless bureaucracy.''
   Pell was one of the hosts for the play, which was performed by
Waterston and Prosky on their day off.

   The medieval fantasy ``Willow,'' a $55 million
gamble in an often-disastrous film genre, found an audience and box
office figures Monday show moviemaker George Lucas apparently has
another hit on his hands.
   ``Willow,'' released early to avoid first-week competition from
certain blockbusters ``Crocodile Dundee II'' and ``Rambo III,'' was
the nation's top-grossing film in its debut weekend with an $8.3
million take.
   MGM-UA chairman Lee Rich said he was buoyed by the figures and
was confident ``Willow'' could maintain its box office appeal
despite the two sure-fire sequels that will flood 2,000 screens
each on Wednesday.
   ``Willow'' surpassed the opening weekend business of ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark'' ($8.26 million in June 1981) and ``Top Gun''
($8.19 million in May 1986), Rich said.
   In addition to high expectations from ``Star Wars'' creator
Lucas and ``Cocoon'' director Ron Howard, ``Willow'' has received
interest because of the amount of money it cost to make the film
over a two-year period.
   It also comes after two expensive Lucas flops _ ``Labyrinth''
and ``Howard the Duck.'' One ``Willow'' critic recently called it
``Ron Howard the Duck.''
   Art Murphy, who monitors box office trends for Daily Variety,
noted that only five motion pictures in history have ever done $8
million-plus during May's traditional pre-Memorial Day holiday
movie slump.
   Other Top 10 films pulled in considerably less during the
weekend.
   Last week's top performer, ``Friday the 13th Part VII - The New
Blood,'' took in $3.43 million to place second in the latest
sweepstakes. It made almost as much as ``Willow'' in its debut with
an $8.2 million take on 1,796 screens.
   In third was ``Colors'' with $2.9 million, followed by
``Beetlejuice'' with $2.7 million and ``Shakedown'' in fifth with
$1.2 million.
   In ``Willow,'' the main character lives in a village of little
people and finds a baby floating in the river, but it's a special
baby who will threaten the throne of the evil Queen Bavmorda.
   The queen orders her warriors to find and kill the baby and the
story revolves around the perilous trek to a castle sanctuary.
   ``Willow,'' which opened Friday at 1,024 theaters nationwide
with little enthusiasm from reviewers, is the latest effort from
Lucas, whose ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones'' films have grossed
$1 billion.
   Chicago Tribune reviewer David Kehr said of Lucas: ``In
`Willow,' the Force has left him. He's imitating himself and he's
moping while he does it.''
   Daily Variety termed the film ``a medieval mishmash'' but
predicted ``kids will probably love it.'' The Hollywood Reporter
praised the production values but complained the storyline ``never
really kicks into overdrive.''
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release, and estimated production costs when available.
   1. ``Willow,'' MGM-UA, $8.31 million, 1,024 screens, $8,106 per
screen, $8.3 million, one week, n-a.

   A 19-year-old student from Thailand who
studied in Pasadena and Los Angeles was crowned Miss Universe of
1988 in a flashy competition on this Asian island Tuesday morning.
   Porntip Nakhirunkanok, a black-haired Bangkok resident, won
$250,000 in cash and prizes, including a sports car and mink coat.
She wiped away tears of joy and joined her hands together in a Thai
sign of thanks after winning.
   The first runner-up was Miss Korea, Yunjung Chang. She was
followed by Miss Mexico, Amanda Olivares; Miss Japan, Mizuho
Sakaguchi; and Miss Hong Kong, Pauline Yeung. Sixty-six women had
competed.
   Among the 10 semi-finalists was Miss USA, Courtney Gibbs, of
Fort Worth, Texas.
   Miss Nakhirunkanok, who weighs 114 pounds and stands 5 feet 8
inches tall, was educated at Pasadena City College and UCLA in
southern California. She said during the program that she owed her
English-speaking ability to Big Bird on the ``Sesame Street''
children's program.
   Organizers of the 37th Miss Universe pageant estimated 600
million people in 57 countries watched the televised competition
for a successor to the 1987 Miss Universe, Cecilia Bolocco of Chile.
   The program was filmed at 9 a.m. Tuesday (9 p.m. EDT Monday)
from a 9,000-seat sports stadium in a Taipei suburb so U.S. viewers
could watch during prime time Monday evening. The schedule forced
the local audience to don tuxedos and evening attire at an hour
more appropriate for reading the morning newspaper over a bowl of
cereal.
   The live broadcast seen in Taiwan was briefly interrupted with a
bulletin for a civil defense emergency exercise in the central
island.
   Missing from this year's festivities was long-time host Bob
Barker, who resigned after last year's competition in Singapore to
protest the use of furs. He was replaced by television personality
Alan Thicke.
   Beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by Taiwan's leaders, who
viewed the competitions as an extravagance for a poor nation and
were dismayed by reports that a Miss China winner performed strip
dances in Las Vegas.
   The island has since emerged as one of Asia's most prosperous
countries, and authorities lifted the ban last year to clear the
way for a domestic airline to sponsor the Miss Universe pageant.
There is lingering opposition from a few groups, including retired
soldiers who view beauty contests as an insult to mothers.
   But the telecast generally was seen in Taiwan as an opportunity
to present the island to a worldwide audience as the Republic of
China, the official name of Taiwan seldom used internationally
because most countries recognize the rival communist Chinese
government in Beijing.
   Organizers pledged to refer to Taiwan as the Republic of China
during the telecast and promised the two-hour program would have
about 30 minutes of videotapes taken during recent weeks of the
contestants at scenic spots in Taiwan.
   The Miss Universe pageant generated much interest in Taiwan but
was pushed into the background Friday when the island's most
violent anti-government protest in recent years broke out in
Taipei. The 18-hour street battle between protesters and police
left more than 200 people injured. Nearly 100 demonstrators were
detained.
   Prizes for the 1988 Miss Universe include $76,000 in cash, a
Maserati convertible automobile, and a mink coat and mink jacket.
   The 11 judges include Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who made
history with their round-the-world flight aboard the Voyager two
years ago, and Susan Ruttan of the television series ``L.A. Law.''

<TEXT>
   Jack Kent is making money and enemies at
both ends of the 275-foot-long contraption he runs near this town
of oil men and shrimp boats.
   His hazardous waste kiln at Marine Shale Processors _ big as a
football field with a smokestack 140 feet high _ is a high-profile
presence on the flat southern Louisiana horizon.
   It's also a target of two groups that want to shut it down: some
local residents who suspect it's dangerous and business competitors
who accuse the company of skirting environmental regulations.
   Marine Shale, which employs about 240 people, denies the claims
and insists that it cooperates fully with regulators.
   In Washington as well as Louisiana, the debate centers on
whether Kent's contraption is an incinerator, which must meet one
set of regulations, or a recycling plant, required to meet others.
   Kent charges $200 to $300 per 50-gallon drum to take in
hazardous wastes from the companies that make them, ranging from
glues to various petroleum by-products, but excluding PCBs,
dioxins, asbestos, explosives, mercury compounds or
disease-carrying materials. He receives 720 tons a day.
   He heats the waste to about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit for 2{
hours while running it through a whirling kiln that looks like an
elongated cement mixer. He sells the resulting aggregate as
material for road beds and parking lots. He has about 10 customers
so far.
   If Marine Shale's claims about its process and product are found
valid by state and federal officials examining the company's
operations, it could render competitors' incinerators obsolete
while revolutionizing the way a growing national hazardous waste
disposal problem is handled.
   It could also be very lucrative for Marine Shale. Company
attorney and vice president George Eldredge says a patent is being
sought for part of the process and licensing arrangements will
follow.
   Eldredge likes to say that incinerators create hazardous waste
for storage in landfills, while Marine Shale eliminates it in the
creation of a product.
   At Marine Shale, next to Bayou Boeuf, conveyors lift piles of
various materials _ some sludgy, some solid and some that serve as
their own fuel _ into a huge rotating cylinder.
   Cameras at both ends monitor the inside of the kiln, which looks
like Hollywood's vision of hell, red hot with glowing embers and
tumbling debris. A computer keeps tabs on temperature, gases and
pressure, shutting down the operation if anything goes awry,
according to Eldredge.
   Earlier this year Marine Shale gave members of Congress clear
plastic letter openers containing a small amount of the aggregate
in the handle. The public relations gimmick prompted Richard
Fortuna, lobbyist for a trade group representing competitors, to
write to the lawmakers and urge them to contact the Capitol's
safety engineer ``to arrange for the transportation of this
material to a permitted facility for proper disposal.''
   ``Sure, we did it,'' acknowledged Fortuna, director of the
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council. He contends the Marine Shale
product is dangerous.
   Kent says envy motivates the Treatment Council. He's charging
less than half what his competitors do to take in hazardous waste,
and then turns it into a product that sells for $1 a ton.
   ``It makes them sad,'' he says sardonically.
   The Treatment Council has joined South Louisianians Against
Pollution, or SLAP, to fight Marine Shale.
   Sally Herman, head of SLAP, says she opposes Marine Shale
because she believes, admittedly without evidence, that the company
may be a factor in the area's unsually high cancer rate.
``Personally, I think they're contributing to it,'' she said.
   SLAP and Fortuna's group have threatened a federal suit to try
to halt Marine Shale's operations.
   The battle has spread to Congress.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., attacked the company in April in a
subcommittee hearing, suggesting that laws might be needed to close
loopholes that allow Marine Shale to operate without an incinerator
permit.
   Kent suggested that Breaux was acting on behalf of his friend
Bill Broadhurst, whose law firm has represented Rollins
Environmental Services Inc., a Treatment Council member. Broadhurst
is the attorney and lobbyist who accompanied former presidential
candidate Gary Hart on the ship ``Monkey Business'' with Donna Rice.
   Breaux spokesman Bob Mann labeled Kent's suggestion ridiculous.
   The 140-foot emissions stack at Marine Shale puts out a steady
plume of vapor, which the company says is clean. Water used to
``scrub'' the gases of particles that might pollute the air is
re-used in the process, he said. Emissions pass through a ``bag
house,'' where, according to Eldredge, they are filtered through
more than a thousand bags, resembling vacuum cleaner bags, before
release into the air.
   Eldredge stressed that none of the water from the Marine Shale
process is discharged into the bayou. He cited state Department of
Environmental Quality records showing that traditional
incinerators, such as the one run by Rollins in Baton Rouge,
contaminate ``scrub'' water that must be treated before it is
discharged into the Mississippi River, a source of drinking water
for New Orleans and other communities.
   About 1,750 companies that generate hazardous materials in 42
states ship them to Marine Shale, according to spokesman Larry
August. The materials are tested to ensure that they can be safely
put in Marine Shale's kiln, he said.

   A record 65,000 people walked across the
4.3 mile eastbound span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.
   Stollers were met Sunday on the west side by Gov. William Donald
Schaefer, who kicked off his One Million Marylanders bay clean-up
campaign, an attempt to get residents to practice water
conservation and change household disposal habits.
   The Bay Bridge Walk, which began at 9 a.m. and was completed by
5:30 p.m., drew 15,000 more people this year than last year's
record, in part because Sunday was one of the first warm weekend
days in what has been a rainy, cool spring.
   The first annual walk was in 1975.
   ``I'm out here every year because it's here,'' said St. Mary's
resident James Chesley. ``Why you walk across a bridge is the same
reason you climb a mountain _ because it's there.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan Tour de Force _ Will it Play on Vremya?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN WOLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   We have a pretty good idea what remarkable
images Americans will see during the upcoming Moscow summit: Reagan
toasted in the Kremlin, embracing dissidents and Bolsheviks,
chatting with Christian monks, talking shop with Russian filmmakers.
   Not to mention Nancy at the Monument to the Defenders in
Leningrad.
   To capture this presidential tour de force, there will be more
American TV technicians in Moscow than spies and diplomats
combined. What with the eight-hour time difference, Reagan
appearances will be beamed back to the United States in plenty of
time for morning newscasts.
   Breakfast at Wimbledon? This will be breakfast at the Hall of
Facets.
   But what about the Soviet people? What will Gostelradio, the
Soviet radio-and-television monopoly, show of the summit? Will
Reagan and the refuseniks lead off Vremya (the evening news)?
   Already, Soviet TV has taped a interview with Reagan for
broadcast on Friday. But it was a simple ``talking head'' session,
30 minutes of question-and-answer _ with none of the adventure or
significance of next week's Reagan tours around Moscow.
   American experts believe Soviet television will broadcast
excerpts from the president's address at Moscow University in the
Lenin Hills, as well as ceremonial exchanges between Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the Kremlin. If there are
agreements to be signed, the klieg lights will be set up in
Vladimir's Hall.
   And surely there will be footage from the Bolshoi, where the
Gorbachevs host the Reagans for a 90-minute ballet sampler.
   But will Soviet officials air highlights from the Danilov
Monastery, where Reagan will discuss religious freedom with monks
who work restoring Orthodox icons? How much will be broadcast from
Reagan's dialogue on artistic freedom with Soviet intellectuals at
the Union of Writers club?
   And what of the first lady's visit to Leningrad _ will she be
shown touring the Hermitage, much as Raisa Gorbachev was shown on
American TV touring the Smithsonian galleries?
   Just what images will Glasnost permit? Will Soviet television
let Reagan be Reagan?
   `It'll be very interesting to see what they show on television
the week before the summit,'' former Ambassador Arthur Hartman said
last week, wondering whether Gostelradio will ``show the bum on the
grate.''
   Soviet TV loves to broadcast pictures of hapless vagabonds
reduced to sleeping on the heat grates near the White House; it's a
sad and pathetic side of the American dream and many viewers of
Soviet TV probably have come to believe it's an accurate snapshot
of life in America.
   But certainly something is afoot on the Gostelradio side of
Glasnost. Just last week, Soviet TV viewers got a glance of Michael
Jackson's Pepsi performance, a glimpse of a Visa card and a sales
pitch for the quality of Sony TVs.
   Never mind that you can't get a Sony TV in the USSR.
   Commercials for Pepsi, Visa and Sony were aired last week in the
midst of a five-part Soviet series on life in the United States.
Estimated audience: 120 million people.
   ``I expect we might get some angry letters from people saying,
`Why are you advertising Sony TVs when we can't buy any?''' TV
personality Vladimir Posner said at a news conference announcing
his series. To hear him tell it, the decision to air the
commercials was less Glasnost than Perestroika (the Gorbachev
campaign for economic reform).
   ``We on our part can make some money out of this, which in our
day and age when we are becoming economically self-supportive and
self-sufficient, also makes sense,'' Posner said. Reports in the
United States said the Soviet broadcast agency Gostelradio received
$10,000 for each 30-second ad.
   Profit motive. That's the American way.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Pullout Saves Gorbachev From Reagan Lecture</HEAD>

   The Soviet decision to withdraw troops from
Afghanistan is more than a life-saving step. It has rescued Mikhail
Gorbachev from another ``leave-the-Afghans-alone'' lecture from
President Reagan.
   As the leaders prepare for their fourth summit, in Moscow May
29-June 2, the first Red Army units have come home to Uzbekistan
and the Soviets seem determined to meet a February 1989 deadline
for the removal of all 115,000 troops.
   The erasure of Afghanistan as the topmost regional issue at the
summit will give Reagan more time to push Gorbachev toward
settlements in other global hot spots _ Cambodia, southern Africa,
the Middle East and Central America.
   At least for now, ``there has been a resolution, or at least the
formula for resolving the Afghan issue,'' said Michael H. Armacost,
undersecretary of state for political affairs and head of the U.S.
team preparing for the summit discussion of regional issues.
   ``At the summit there just isn't that much more to say to them,
except perhaps, `thanks' and `keep up the good work,''' said
another State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   This official, and Armacost as well, suggested, however, that
Afghan issues could re-emerge as a summit topic because the United
States and the Soviet Union are still actively engaged in the
settlement process as the Soviets wind down their eight-year war.
   ``In terms of military arrangements, one of our biggest concerns
is that they take out whatever minefields they have sown over the
past eight years,'' the State Department official said. ``This is
an issue of safety for civilians coming back to their villages.''
   Earlier this year, before the Soviets signed a pledge to
withdraw their troops, the United States beseeched Moscow to take
the further step of ceasing military assistance to the government
headed by Afghan leader Najib.
   In return, the United States said it would stop giving military
support to the mujahadeen, the anti-Soviet resistance fighters,
matching Soviet restraint with U.S. restraint.
   Moscow rejected the proposal and on May 14, the Soviet military
commander in Afghanistan announced he would leave behind up to $1
billion in arms and installations for use by the Afghan army.
   ``That doesn't strike me as a demonstration of tremendous
restraint,'' Armacost said. He reiterated the U.S. determination to
keep helping the guerrillas and said, bluntly, ``we'll have
practical ways of accomplishing that purpose.''
   Asked if Gorbachev might seek Reagan's help in getting the
resistance to let the Russian troops retreat home without being
harried by attacks, Armacost said the Soviets would do better by
seeking ``local arrangements'' with mujahadeen leaders.
   Though these issues remain, the fundamental decision to withdraw
and evidence last week that the agreement is being carried out,
removed an irritant that has nagged U.S.-Soviet relations since
December 1979, when Red Army forces entered what had been a civil
war.
   President Carter protested the invasion by keeping the U.S.
Olympic team home from the 1980 Moscow games and he embargoed grain
sales to the Soviets.
   Reagan resumed the grain deals, but he made clear that better
U.S.-Soviet relations hinged to a large extent on Moscow's
willingness to pull its troops home from the Afghan conflict.
   Indeed, before his met Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, in Reykjavik
in 1986 and in Washington in 1987, he devoted speeches to the issue
and signaled his intention to berate the Soviet leader about
Afghanistan when they met.
   For example, in a speech to the Heritage Foundation eight days
before the Washington summit, Reagan said, ``It's time for them to
pack up, pull out and go home. It's time that they set a date
certain for the complete withdrawal of all Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.''
   Reagan said it appeared that even the Soviets were writing off
the current regime in Kabul. ``The Soviets pride themselves on
recognizing objective reality. Well, it's time for them to bite the
bullet.''
   By contrast, two weeks before the Moscow summit, the White House
found itself praising Soviet actions, calling the pullout ``a
welcome first step.''

   When the government threatened
to close The Weekly Mail, the newspaper responded in typically
irreverent fashion: it printed a rat-faced caricature of the
government minister who issued the warning.
   Since its birth in 1985, The Weekly Mail has been a combative
government opponent, winning staunch friends and making plenty of
enemies, but never losing its sense of humor.
   Its aggressive reporting and sassy political commentary have
earned it the nickname ``The Weekly Wail,'' and many consider it
the best-written newspaper in South Africa.
   The newspaper has a circulation of only 22,000, and most of the
readers are well-off white liberals. Its prominent backers range
from U.S. Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to the Royal Dutch Shell Oil
Co., which places a full-page ad in each issue supporting press
freedom or urging political reform.
   ``Three years ago, we felt the tradition of aggressive, critical
newspapers was being lost,'' said co-editor Anton Harber. ``Our
role has been to pursue in-depth coverage of the townships and
politics and take a more strident stance against censorship.''
   The government repeatedly has attacked The Weekly Mail as part
of the ``alternative media'' that ``fans revolution'' and promotes
outlawed organizations such as the African National Congress, the
largest guerrilla group fighting South Africa's white-led
government.
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha has complained about
numerous articles in The Weekly Mail, issued two official warnings
against the newspaper and threatened to close it for three months.
   Botha already has suspended two newspapers aimed at South
Africa's black majority _ New Nation and South. The Weekly Mail is
one of five more papers that have received warnings.
   ``Botha warned us ... that our wailing threatens public
safety,'' The Weekly Mail said in an editorial on its front page.
``We deny the charge. Our newspaper kicks at consciences and tears
down barriers. It does not throw bombs.''
   ``Don't let us go quietly. Carry on reading us. Carry on
subscribing. Make a fuss. Wail, dammit,'' the editorial said.
   Despite threats of closure, the newspaper continues to pursue
controversial stories critical of the government and its system of
apartheid, which prohibits blacks from having a voice in national
affairs.
   Recent articles have challenged government casualty figures for
South Africans fighting the Marxist government in Angola's civil
war; suggested South African agents were behind the killings of
African National Congress officials abroad; examined the African
National Congress in a report from the group's headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia; and provided a detailed account of a black activist
who allegedly was kidnapped and assaulted by the army.
   ``We've managed to put issues on the agenda that weren't being
covered by the larger papers,'' said Harber.
   While the newspaper focuses on serious political issues, it
regularly finds room for lighter matters. It is the only South
African newspaper to run the American comic strip Doonesbury, and
it has lively culture and sports sections, often written with an
acid wit.
   Brian Mitchell, the World Boxing Association junior-lightweight
champion who must fight abroad to have his bouts officially
sanctioned, is described by the paper as South Africa's ``only
diplomat with clout.''
   After a white South African sprinter ran 100 meters in 10.06
seconds, newspapers and the state-run television network checked
the record books and proclaimed him the ``world's fourth fastest
white man.''
   A Weekly Mail columnist responded: ``My next sporting goal is to
become the seventh-fastest, gray-bearded, pink-freckled, left-eyed,
sexagenarian, tanned-but-white hurdler over four meters... Glory
beckons.''
   When a South American field hockey team competed in South Africa
as a ``mystery team'' to avoid criticism for boycott-busting, other
newspapers protected its anonymity.
   But The Weekly Mail's staffer attended a game and reported that
knowledgable fans were preoccupied with the weather, repeatedly
saying, ``Chilly.''
   Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, describes
The Weekly Mail's political coverage as ``stylish, sophisticated,
frequently clever, and aimed at an elite market.''
   The weekly paper posed no threat to public safety because it is
aimed at the ``gentlest, least violent, most anxious, guilt-ridden,
sweetly intentioned middle class,'' a Business Day editorial said.
   ``(Botha) and his advisers have neither the general education,
nor the wit, to distinguish between revolution and radical chic,''
it added.
   Harber says staff morale remains high, although it is unclear
what will happen to the newspaper if it is closed for three months.
   ``We've always figured that we would probably be shut down at
some point,'' said Harber. ``It's tough working under these kind of
conditions, but it's something we've had to get used to.''

<HEAD>Open Enrollment Puts Students, Parents On Honor System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new state law allowing students to choose
their schools will improve education, proponents say. But some
educators fear the plan could hurt smaller schools and bring
unhealthy competition.
   ``We realize there may be some poor choice-making in the free
market, but the challenge is to educate parents in how to make
sound choices,'' says Nan Skelton, assistant state education
commissioner.
   The measure gives Minnesota the nation's broadest open
enrollment plan, Skelton said. Schools may refuse students only if
the transfer would interfere with desegregation ratios in
Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth, or if the school is too crowded.
   State funding, about $3,000 per youngster, follows the student
to the new district. Previously, parents had to pay tuition to the
new district.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich signed the measure into law May 6. It takes
effect in the 1989-90 school year in larger districts and applies
statewide in 1990-91.
   State education officials hope schools will improve their
programs in the competition to attract students. A 1986 National
Governors' Association project recommended open enrollment as a way
to boost school quality.
   ``I have mixed feelings,'' said Jeff Keller, an assistant to the
superintendent of the 89-student Humboldt-St. Vincent school
district, one of the state's smallest. ``If they're put on the
honor system, are they going to transfer for the right reasons?''
   A champion debate coach worries about students transferring for
non-academic reasons.
   ``For some students, those activities are a very important part
of what they're about,'' said Randy Keillor of St. Francis High
School, whose teams have won three state titles in six years and
one national title.
   But Keillor says he sees the value of such plans.
   ``If the concept is to allow parents and students some choice,
you have to recognize that's important for them,'' Keillor said.
   Students could transfer to schools where their chances of making
an athletic team might be better or to join friends, but it's
debatable whether those are poor reasons to switch, Skelton said.
   ``It's just who gets to judge,'' she said. ``The people who get
to make the decisions are the parents and the students. If the
Education Department thinks it's a frivolous reason, it doesn't
matter.''
   Mary Kay Frisch of St. Paul, who lives on the border between two
districts, took advantage of a forerunner of the law and sent her
two children to a different district so they could be with their
friends.
   ``They just love going to school. If they (children) aren't
happy being at a school, they aren't happy doing anything there,''
Mrs. Frisch said.
   The Minnesota School Boards Association opposes allowing
students to transfer for non-academic reasons.
   ``I don't think students should be permitted to exchange
districts for athletic reasons or for some personality reasons. It
seems to me that really could cause some chaos or problems,'' said
Executive Director Willard Baker, whose association represents 435
districts.
   The Minnesota Federation of Teachers, which represents 20,000
teachers, has not taken a position.
   ``There's a possibility that small districts could end up losing
students,'' said Sandra Peterson, federation president. ``They may
have to look at cooperative ventures with other districts or
consolidation.''
   Minnesota began open enrollment on a voluntary basis this school
year, with 137 students in 95 districts choosing to participate.
Under the voluntary program, districts had the option of accepting
transfers from outside their districts.
   For the 1988-89 school year, 435 students in 153 districts
applied, said Kenneth Zastrow, director of support services for the
state education department.
   U.S. Department of Education officials have applauded
Minnesota's efforts.
   ``The overwhelming majority will not make decisions like these
for frivolous reasons,'' said Mitchell Pearlstein, spokesman for
the department's Office of Educational Research and Improvement.
``Indeed, most students will not change school districts. But
choice is valuable even when people decide to stay where they are.''
   Keillor said he hopes the new law will prompt more schools to
offer debate programs, but worries about the effect of transfers on
his own program.
   ``If we had even four students transfer into our school and they
were good, that would lock up all positions so kids from St.
Francis would not have a shot,'' Keillor said.
   On the other hand, Keillor said, ``If open enrollment provides a
marketplace for education, then, shoot, that's going to get more
schools looking at adding this program.''

   On Madison Avenue, it would be called an image
make-over.
   In the Kremlin, the shifts and realignments in Soviet foreign
policy over the past three years have been labeled ``new thinking.''
   The change in appearance of Soviet diplomacy has boosted
Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's standing in the world
and improved the atmosphere at international meetings.
   Stony-faced officials have been replaced by smiling, congenial
diplomats, such as Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
Communist Party foreign affairs secretary Anatoly F. Dobrynin.
   A more active schedule of foreign visits has distinguished
Gorbachev's tenure, and Soviet officials have emulated their
leader's more open approach by giving news conferences and social
events at home and during trips abroad.
   The smoother style has done much to break down the wall of
mystery that has surrounded the Soviet Union since the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution that gave birth to the world's first socialist
state.
   But in Gorbachev's rebuilding of relations with countries in
regions as diverse as the Middle East, Western Europe, Central
America and Asia, many of the pieces of Kremlin foreign policy have
fallen into familiar places.
   Gorbachev coined the ``new thinking'' phrase in speeches during
his first months as party general secretary, calling on his
nation's policy-makers to take a fresh look at Soviet relations and
activity around the world.
   The foreign policy mosaic evident three years after Gorbachev
assumed power shows some advances, broadened influence _ and
stagnation.
   The most dramatic achievements have been the start of Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, agreed to after eight years of
fighting and five years of negotiation, and the signing last Dec. 8
of an agreement with the United States to eliminate medium-range
nuclear missiles, the first treaty to scrap an entire class of
nuclear weapons.
   Gorbachev and other senior Soviets have claimed the INF
agreement was a result of Kremlin flexibility and perseverance
toward fulfilling their goal of a nuclear-free world by the year
2000, a disarmament plan set out in a speech by the leader in
January 1986.
   President Reagan, on the other hand, attributes it to the White
House policy of dealing with the Soviets ``from a position of
strength.''
   Despite the rhetoric and conflicting claims of responsibility,
the movement on arms control has encouraged observers to believe
that ``new thinking'' has moved from idea to action in some
instances, although the outcome remains mixed and at times
contradictory.
   Relations with the United States have surpassed the detente era
of the 1970s, when the superpowers' policy of mutual tolerance
produced a short-lived warm spot in the postwar chill. Peace,
friendship and educational exchange groups arrive daily to build
bridges between Soviet and American citizens.
   But the leaders continue to regard each other as adversaries.
   West Germany, France, England and other major European powers
have shared in the warmth of better ties between the superpowers
and progress toward nuclear arms control. Yet the societies of East
and West retain sharp differences, including their definitions of
personal freedom and fundamental human rights.
   While Soviet soldiers are leaving the war in Afghanistan, the
Kremlin's support for Nicaragua, Angola and Cambodia remains a
point of contention between the superpowers. It also suggests that
the Kremlin's historic practice of spreading socialist revolution
remains a goal.
   The Kremlin's reforms have spread in part to Eastern Europe,
where the Soviet bloc, to some degree, have been able to choose
their own course of development. With that comes more
responsibility for their own economic performance and less reliance
on Moscow for support.
   Soviet influence have seen the least change in the troubled
Mideast region, where the Arab-Israeli conflict still draws a sharp
line between the superpowers. And neither has succeeded in defusing
the Iran-Iraq war.
   The Kremlin has given its relations with Libya a lower public
profile and tried to gain some influence with Iran in hopes of
resolving the 8-year-old Gulf War. However, the Soviets still have
no diplomatic ties with Israel and is viewed as too closely aligned
with some Arab countries to broker a peace accord in the Middle
East.
   The Kremlin has continued to make restoration of diplomatic ties
with Israel contingent on the Jewish state's departure from Arab
territories occupied after the 1967 Mideast War. However, an
exchange of visits by consular delegations was permitted last year
and a sharp rise in Jewish emigration from Soviet Union have to
some degree improved the Soviet-Israeli relationship.

   Bob Duntley has traded in his ties and
starched shirts. Casual dress will do these days, when instead of
calling customers from his comfortable office, he stands in line to
make his pitch on a pay phone.
   ``It's like fighting with one arm tied behind your back,'' said
Duntley, 55, as he scanned a legal pad filled with names of
potential buyers around the country for Ameristate Corp.'s $7,500
steel-cutting equipment.
   ``Actually, it's like throwing your money down the drain.''
   ``It'' is the hassle created by the Great Phone Outage.
   It began May 8, when a fire damaged virtually all the vital
hardware at an Illinois Bell Co. switching station.
   At first, the outage seemed only a minor inconvenience for
customers in a handful of Du Page County communities about 30 miles
west of Chicago. But as Bell crews examined the smoldering cables
and water-damaged electronics, the picture became much clearer _
and very bleak.
   Phones for 35,000 customers were dead indefinitely, silencing
the simple crosstown call or the long-distance business deal.
Limited local service has since been restored, but calls outside
the immediate area are hit or miss.
   To offset the lack of phone service, towns increased police
patrols. For several days, public employees also sat in vehicles on
street corners watching for crime or fire or medical emergencies.
   There have been no reports of any law enforcement or fire
problems linked to the outage, however.
   Illinois Bell crews are working around the clock to replace the
wrecked equipment, but the job may take until June.
   ``It's total confusion. It's been a disaster,'' said Joan
Schramm, an officer of the Hinsdale Chamber of Commerce.
   Hinsdale, with 16,700 residents, is one of the largest
communities affected, but there is little industry here. With its
cozy, colonial-style downtown shops and century-old homes, the
village is a soothing retreat from the hectic pace of Chicago.
   But to the south in Oak Brook, Burr Ridge and Willowbrook,
industrial parks sprawl along Interstate 55. Some of the country's
biggest corporate names are here, including McDonald's Corp., which
employs 1,500 people at its headquarters.
   ``Calls to downtown Chicago have been tricky,'' said McDonald's
spokeswoman Lana E. Ehrsam. ``If one finally gets through, we might
pass the phone around. Despite the fire we are able to keep
operating. We were never totally without anything.
   ``We've been using a lot of resources,'' she added, ``Faxing and
Telexing all over.''
   ``It's driving me crazy,'' said Dirk Tweed, a salesman for
Outdoor Sports Headquarters Inc. in Willowbrook. ``At first I
thought it was funny, you know, `Hey the phones don't work.' Now I
guess it's pretty serious.
   ``I still run my regular route to stores that want hunting and
fishing stuff, but I really can't tell what they might need if I
don't have a phone,'' Tweed said. ``Heck, I can't even call my boss
in Dayton, Ohio.''
   He said he spends much of his time reading magazines and talking
to two secretaries.
   ``How are we coping? This is how we're coping,'' says Vicki
Riendeau, chewing a candy bar with her legs up on the desk. ``If
this keeps up, I'll be a raving lunatic. We've looked at the files
and already rearranged what we rearranged last week. What else is
there?''
   Among the hardest hit are 24,000 florists nationwide that belong
to FTD Inc., the flower delivery network.
   About half are hooked to a computer system in Downers Grove
designed to relay an order across the country in a snap. But the
line to the FTD computer network flows through the Hinsdale station.
   ``We've been absolutely crippled,'' said Bob Poirier, director
of operations for FTD subsidiary Floral Network Inc., who has the
task of trying to find an alternative system.
   ``The flower business has not stopped _ people can still call
and order. But instead of using the computer network, florists have
to look up florists in other cities and call them one by one. That
hurts.''
   The switching station, meanwhile, has come to resemble a
traveling circus.
   Big mess tents are erected for the dozens of laborers assigned
to get the site back in order, and Illinois Bell executives call
the shots from a row of trailers. Customers line up at a bank of
portable pay phones trucked in by the utility.
   ``It's been a disaster, but it's folksy,'' said Nancy Ging, a
local psychotherapist, referring to the small talk between people
waiting to use the phones.
   ``There are pluses as well as minuses,'' she said. ``One plus is
people have to be resourceful. Most people don't know how strong
they are, how they can get along. ... I'm impressed with how well
people have been coping.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Long-Range Missile Treaty Could Be Signed By
January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a U.S.-Soviet treaty
reducing long-range nuclear weapons could be signed by January but
that he will not set aside disputes over the ``Star Wars'' program
to reach such an accord.
   The Soviet leader also said his policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, includes freedom of speech, but he condemned a leading
dissident as a ``parasite'' and accused him of ``sponging on the
democratic process.''
   Gorbachev's comments came in a pre-summit interview with two
American news organizations. The Soviet news agency Tass on Sunday
ran a partial transcript of the interview with The Washington Post
and Newsweek.
   Radio Moscow's English-language foreign service also carried a
report about it as its lead item on Sunday. Soviet television's
widely watched evening news program ``Vremya'' mentioned as its
lead item that the interview had been published in Washington and
would appear in today's Soviet newspapers.
   The 90-minute discussion, in which Gorbachev also proposed a
joint U.S.-Soviet trip to Mars, covered a wide range of foreign and
domestic issues.
   The interview, conducted in the Kremlin on Wednesday, produced a
startling Biblical reference by the head of the officially
atheistic state.
   When asked about how far glasnost should go and about criticism
of dictator Josef V. Stalin, the 57-year-old Communist Party leader
said:
   ``Jesus Christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew how
to feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread. We don't possess
that skill, we have no ready prescription to solve all our problems
quickly.''
   The interview was conducted 11 days before President Reagan's
arrival in Moscow for a five-day summit with Gorbachev. It will be
their fourth meeting.
   Although the Tass transcript included much of the interview, it
deleted a reference to Yegor Ligachev, the Kremlin's No. 2 man. It
also left out a reference to Gorbachev's wife, Raisa.
   Ligachev, considered more conservative than the Soviet leader,
reportedly wants to slow Gorbachev's policy of ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, of the Soviet economy and society.
   Gorbachev acknowledged a lively debate between the two but said
``to present these discussions _ which are a normal part of the
democratic process _ as division within the leadership would be a
great mistake itself.''
   Gorbachev expressed optimism that a superpower agreement to cut
strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons will be completed by the
time Reagan leaves office in January. ``We want to have that
signed,'' he said.
   If the agreement ``comes to be drafted under the present U.S.
administration, I see no reason why President Reagan and I should
not sign it. I would certainly welcome that,'' Gorbachev added.
   However, he cautioned that he has no plans to set aside disputes
to hasten an agreement. ``If we sign with one hand a treaty
reducing strategic offensive forces in one area and at the same
time launch an arms race in space or at sea, what would be the
point? That would be senseless,'' he said.
   He reiterated his opposition to Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missile
defense program, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, saying
the leader who promotes an escalation of the arms race in space
``is committing a crime against the people _ his own people, and
others.''
   U.S. and Soviet officials have said they don't believe the
long-range nuclear weapons treaty will be completed by the end of
Reagan's term.
   Another treaty to ban short- and medium-range nuclear weapons is
being debated by the U.S. Senate.
   Gorbachev said he will ask Reagan at the summit to approve a
joint Soviet-U.S. unmanned flight to Mars. ``Why shouldn't we work
together? We have great experience, you have great experience _ let
us cooperate to master the cosmos, to fulfill big programs,'' he
said.
   On domestic affairs, Gorbachev was asked whether glasnost
includes freedom of speech. ``While freedom of speech is
indispensable for glasnost, we see glasnost as a broader
phenomenon,'' he said.
   Glasnost is ``the right of every citizen to openly say what he
or she thinks about all social and political questions,'' he added.
   Gorbachev was asked later whether freedom of speech applies to
dissidents such as Moscow journalist Sergei Grigoryants, who was
jailed for a week earlier this month. Gorbachev said Soviets think
of Grigoryants ``as some kind of alien phenomenon in our society
sponging on the democratic process.''
   Gorbachev went on to call Grigoryants a ``parasite.'' It was a
rare reference by a Soviet leader to a dissident.
   Grigoryants, editor of the dissident magazine Glasnost, said the
computer and printer used to produce the journal were confiscated
when he was arrested.
   In a telephone interview on Sunday, he called Gorbachev's
comments about him ``very unpleasant.''

   For years, Rep. Delbert Latta groomed
his son to replace him when he retired from Congress. But another
well-known Ohio Republican had a different idea about who will go
to Washington.
   After the elder Latta announced in January he would not seek
re-election, it seemed only natural that Robert Latta would declare
his candidacy for Ohio's 5th District.
   But the Lattas didn't count on a challenge from within. The
challenge came from Republican Paul Gillmor, who had irritated the
Lattas just enough to prompt murmurs of a feud.
   Gillmor was the highest ranking GOP legislator in the state and
candidate for his party's nomination for governor in 1986.
   Official vote totals from the May 3 congressional primary show
Gillmor defeated Latta by 41 votes of more than 63,000 cast in a
three-way race. But a recount is automatic because of the slim
margin _ 28,680 to 28,639 _ and even the Ohio secretary of state
says the race is too close to call.
   ``I don't think it divided the Republicans because I ran a
positive race,'' Gillmor, 49, said last week. ``I said before the
primary race that I would support the eventual nominee. I expect
they would do the same.''
   Robert Latta has refused to concede, but the 32-year-old
corporate attorney from Bowling Green said he will support Gillmor
if Gillmor is the nominee.
   ``As a Republican for my entire life, you support Republicans,''
he said.
   Hoping to pick up the pieces is Democrat Thomas Murray, a
51-year-old Sandusky attorney making his second run for Congress.
Murray believes the departure of the elder Latta will end GOP
domination in the Bowling Green district, which now boasts more
registered Democrats than Republicans.
   ``Nobody believed I could beat Del Latta in 1986, and they were
right. It was like running against an institution,'' Murray said.
``There's no doubt that he has the contacts in the district from 30
years of service, but I'm not sure the same can be said for any of
the Republicans this time.''
   Michael Marsh, chairman of the Wood County Republican Party,
said Murray may be chasing moonbeams.
   ``I think (the GOP primary) had the potential to be a real nasty
kind of thing, but basically I think the candidates did a good job
of talking about themselves rather than each other,'' he said.
   ``I think it makes it easier to put together a campaign in the
fall for the winner. ... I just don't see people flocking to vote
for Thomas Murray.''
   Marsh said a rift occurred between Gillmor and Delbert Latta in
1982, when the Legislature was redrawing congressional district
lines. At the time, Gillmor was president of the Ohio Senate _ a
position he still holds.
   Marsh said Gillmor was trying to redraw the 9th Congressional
District, a traditional Democratic stronghold that includes Toledo,
so it would be more favorable for Edward Weber, a Republican
elected in 1980.
   To accomplish that, Gillmor wanted to take away one county and
part of another from Latta's district and place it in the 9th
District, Marsh said. He also wanted to move Latta's district east.
   Latta opposed Gillmor's plan, Marsh said.
   Eventually, Latta's district moved a bit east and lost parts of
Wood and Fulton counties. The 9th District gained a part of a
Democratic stronghold.
   The result: Weber lost in 1982, and the 9th District, under
Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur is once again Democratic territory.
   Later, Gillmor found himself shut out of some GOP functions in
northwestern Ohio. For example, he discovered he was an outsider
during President Reagan's visit to Bowling Green in 1984.
   ``They have a dais in a hall and have 50 people up there _
Latta's neighbors are up there _ but the president of the Ohio
Senate is sitting out in the crowd,'' said one Republican official,
who spoke on the condition his name not be used.
   The elder Latta, 67, son of a barber, is serving his 15th term
in Congress. He is senior Republican member of the House Budget
Committee and a veteran member of the House Rules Committee.

<HEAD>FmHA's New Loanmaking Policies To Allow For Debt Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New regulations to reshape the Farmers Home
Administration's loan policies will cost $8.7 billion and push as
many as 64,800 farmers into liquidation or foreclosure, the agency
says.
   The FmHA, an agency of the Agriculture Department, is scheduled
to open the proposed changes to public comment this week. A summary
of the agency's proposal was made available to The Associated Press.
   Cheryl Cook, a lobbyist and lawyer for the National Farmers
Union, said she had not had an opportunity to study the FmHA's
proposal in detail but indicated that the figures cited by the
agency appeared to be in line with estimates.
   ``If they had used the authority that they had gotten in the
1985 farm (law) to restructure this debt, we wouldn't be in a
situation now where it was too late for 64,800 people,'' she said.
   The FmHA is often called the government's farm lender of last
resort because loans are made only to those who cannot qualify at
banks or other commercial sources. Overall, the agency's farm loan
portfolio totals around $26 billion to 250,000 borrowers.
   With loan delinquencies rising, FmHA was directed by Congress in
last year's Agricultural Credit Act to rewrite many of its
regulations so that borrowers would be given a greater opportunity
to restructure or spread out payments and still hold onto their
land.
   In many cases, debts far beyond the ability of farmers to repay
would be ``written down'' to manageable levels or forgiven
entirely. Many other regulatory changes also were ordered by the
new law.
   Basically, the write-down would reduce a farmer's FmHA debt to
the level of his assets, depending upon his ability to operate with
enough cash flow thereafter to repay the new loan balance.
   The proposed regulations are scheduled for publication this week
in the Federal Register, the government's official rulemaking
document, and will be open for public comment for 30 days.
   In its summary, the FmHA said about 118,000 borrowers ``were
delinquent or in some other default status in early 1988.'' Those
included 16,000 borrowers who have been ``accelerated'' by the
agency, a process that leads to forced liquidation or foreclosure
for hopeless cases.
   But the agency estimated that about 37,000 of the 118,000
delinquents ``will be able to resolve repayment problems through
normal servicing procedures'' such as the rescheduling of loan
installments and other alternatives.
   ``The remaining 81,000 borrowers would be eligible for
consideration of restructuring with write-down of debt,'' the
report said. ``Based on an earlier survey of borrowers eligible to
restructuring with write-down of debt, an estimated 20 percent
(16,200) of the 81,000 borrowers are able to show repayment on
remaining debt and qualify for the write-down.''
   It added: ``About two-thirds of the borrowers are unable to show
repayment ability on remaining debt and would be rejected for
write-down. The remaining potential write-down borrowers would not
be considered for write-down because their debt was less than the
estimated recovery value.''
   The report included a brief profile of borrowers in the survey
who qualified for FmHA debt write-down:
   _A large proportion of their total debt was with FmHA.
   _The FmHA loans were ``greatly under-secured'' or there was no
net value in the security for FmHA, which mean that a large
percentage, or all, of their FmHA debt would be subject to
write-down.
   _A substantial portion of the borrower's income was from
off-farm jobs.
   Costs of writing down FmHA debt for the estimated 16,200
qualified borrowers were estimated at a net of $2.1 billion.
   The agency said that its federal budget authority ``may be
dramatically affected by the revised servicing procedures as loan
losses will tend to be recognized up front'' as the write-downs are
incurred instead of after the liquidation and delayed settlement of
the debts.
   ``Requested reimbursement (of agency funding) for losses may be
increased from about $1 billion in fiscal year 1989 to a
substantial share of the total estimated write-down and loan losses
of $8.7 billion in fiscal year 1990,'' the FmHA said.

<HEAD>Nursing Group Watches Trial Of Nurse Accused Of Potassium Overdose</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The verdict in the trial of a
Maryland nurse accused of killing hospital patients with a common
substance used for a variety of medical procedures will influence
how all nurses go about their jobs, a spokeswoman for a nurses
organization says.
   Jane Bolding, formerly a nurse at the Prince George's Hospital
Center about 20 miles east of the nation's capital, is accused of
killing three of her intensive care patients by injecting them with
lethal doses of potassium and attempting to murder two others the
same way.
   Potassium is found naturally in the body, but in large amounts
can cause cardiac arrest.
   A guilty verdict would likely have a ``chilling effect'' on
health care officials who routinely prescribe and administer common
medicines like sodium bicarbonate and insulin, which can be fatal
if used in large quantities, said Carol Grimaldi, a spokeswoman for
the American Nurses Association, based in Kansas City, Mo.
   Such a verdict ``would make it more difficult for people to
carry on in an already stressful environment,'' she said.
   ``We usually see cases where people are accused of murder by
turning off machines or poisoning, not the use of an organic
compound,'' she said. The 180,000-member association represents
registered nurses.
   Autopsies on the three victims all revealed inexplicably high
levels of potassium. But no official cause of death was ever listed
in any of the cases and no one witnessed Bolding doing anything
wrong.
   If Bolding is convicted of murder, the case could have
ramifications for the nation's health care industry, according to
defense attorney Burt Kahn.
   ``If this case went unchallenged, there would be paranoia
throughout the medical industry,'' Kahn said. ``This case is a
medical and legal nightmare.''
   What makes the case so important is that potassium, an
electrolyte found in the body, is also used for a variety of common
medical purposes in hospitals, Kahn said.
   Assistant State's Attorney Jay Creech has called Bolding ``a
killer angel.'' He is basing his case on a study by the federal
Centers for Disease Control that indicates more of Bolding's
patients died of cardiac arrest than did those of any other nurse
at the hospital.
   On the first day of trial in Prince George's County Circuit
Court last Wednesday, defense attorneys scoffed at the CDC report,
and said the prosecution's case is based on the flimsiest of
circumstantial evidence.
   On Thursday, Bolding's attorneys got the pathologist for the
intensive care unit of the hospital where the nurse worked to say
that potassium levels normally begin to rise as soon as a patient
dies.
   Dr. Ivan Matei said that once the heart stops _ and oxygen
ceases to flow in the bloodstream _ tissues and cells begin to
break down, releasing stored-up potassium.
   ``It's a normal process,'' Matei told the court.
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, in which a strenuous chest
massage is used in efforts to restart the heart, also causes tissue
breakdown, Matei testified. In addition, kidney failure contributes
to high potassium rates because the bloodstream, which caries
potassium, is not purified, Matei added.
   CPR was attempted on all three patients Bolding is accused of
killing, and at least one had kidney problems, hospital records
indicate.
   ``We say it's impossible to tell whether potassium caused the
heart attacks, or whether the heart attacks resulted in high levels
of potassium,'' Kahn said. ``This whole case is about doubt.''
   The investigation of Bolding runs from January 1984 to March
1985, but Kahn introduced into the court record documents
indicating high potassium levels for patients at the hospital
during a 10-year period that encompasses the Bolding probe.
   Creech has relied on hospital records in an attempt to establish
that Bolding was present when the patients died, but hospital
officials testified under cross examination that many others also
had access to the alleged victims.
   None of Bolding's former colleagues who have testified so far
have questioned the nurse's work ethic or job performance.
   Bolding was indicted after a grand jury heard testimony last
year on the CDC study. The non-jury trial is expected to last up to
eight weeks.

<HEAD>Poultry And Pork Consumption Grows With Meat Consumption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's biggest meat eaters are curbing
their appetites for beef and looking for second helpings of poultry
and pork.
   Per capita meat consumption in the major producing countries _
usually the richest _ grew about 11 percent over the last decade,
says an Agriculture Department report. But the gains weren't across
the board.
   ``For instance, most of the increase came from poultry and pork,
while beef declined,'' the report said. ``Consumption of lamb,
mutton and goat stagnated worldwide.''
   In 1975-77, Americans averaged about 127 pounds of beef and
veal, 59 pounds of pork, 2 pounds of lamb, mutton and goat, and 51
pounds of poultry.
   By 1985-87, per capita consumption was: beef and veal, 106
pounds; pork, 63; lamb, mutton and goat, 2; and poultry, 73. Those
are carcass weight equivalents before being divided and trimmed
into retail cuts.
   Even in Argentina, the biggest meat-eater of all, per capita
beef consumption dropped to 174 pounds from 187 a decade earlier.
Declines also occurred for lamb, mutton and goat meat, and poultry,
each down 1 pound.
   However, the Soviet Union, which has been striving to upgrade
diets, boosted beef consumption to 62 pounds per capita from 52
pounds in 1975-77, while pork increased to 48 pounds from 43. Lamb,
mutton and goat held steady at 3 pounds, but poultry consumption
jumped to 23 pounds from 14 pounds previously.
   The report was included by the department's Economic Research
Service in the agency's quarterly National Food Review issued last
week.
   Analysts noted that per capita meat consumption is affected by
many factors, including local and world economies, religion, social
customs and even climate.
   ``Most meat is produced and consumed in high-income countries,''
the report said. ``However, new technologies, like improved
refrigeration and transportation, in developing countries have
opened the door for meat imports and improved the distribution of
such products.''
   On the other hand, religion sometimes restricts the kinds of
meats that are acceptable in certain countries. Moslems and Jews
shun pork, and Hindus avoid all meat.
   Pork is the predominant meat in Europe, especially Eastern
Europe, as well as in China, Japan and other Asian nations. In
China, alone, where about a third of the world's pork is produced,
consumption rose to about 35 pounds from 18 pounds during the
decade, the report said.
   Poultry consumption has gained the most, reflecting the
relatively brief time span and less feed required to produce a
pound of poultry meat, compared with other grain-fed livestock.
   ``Beef consumption predominates in North and South America and
in Australia and New Zealand, where an abundance of forage is
available for ruminant livestock production,'' the report said.
``Ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats can be raised without any
grain, but this requires reliable sources of cheap forage.''

   Despite sharp differences over agricultural
policy and subsidies, the 12-nation European Economic Community
remains the leading market for U.S. farm products.
   In calendar 1987, according to the Agriculture Department,
exports of farm products to the EEC were worth $6.8 billion, up by
more than 3 percent from 1986. Although sales to the European bloc
_ and farm exports generally, for that matter _ have not recovered
to their record levels of the early 1980s, USDA analysts say
further growth can be expected.
   But EEC leaders frostily reject a U.S. proposal made in
negotiations under auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade to phase out all trade-distorting farm subsidies by the end
of the century.
   Willy De Clercq, the EEC's top trade official, said in Paris
last week at a meeting of trade ministers that the trade bloc would
never agree to the elimination of such subsidies, although it
favors unspecified reductions.
   According to a recent analysis by the department's Economic
Research Service, U.S. farm exports to the EEC this year could rise
by an additional 5 percent because of ``attractive U.S. prices,
favorable exchange rates and continued economic growth'' in the EEC
countries.

   A dispatch from an Agriculture Department
trade official in Bonn says West Germans are eating more rice these
days.
   ``Rice, noodles and additional vegetable consumption are
replacing the traditional potato as the No. 1 German food item,''
says Gerald W. Harvey, U.S. agricultural counselor. ``Rice millers
are confident that this trend will continue into 1988.''
   Harvey's comments were reported in the June issue of Foreign
Agriculture magazine.
   Competitive prices for U.S. rice pushed shipments up sharply
last year and primarily replaced rice from Thailand and Italy, he
said.

   Britain's chief rabbi has approved the
demolition of Hong Kong's 86-year-old synagogue to make way for a
complex containing a new synagogue and high-rise apartments, a
local Jewish leader said.
   The plan to demolish the Ohel Leah synagogue split the local
Jewish community and enraged preservationists, who see the project
as another blow to this British colony's heritage.
   However, supporters argued that the Ohel Leah synagogue is
dangerously old and better facilities are needed for a growing
Jewish community.
   The chief rabbi of the United Kingdom and the Commonweath, Lord
Immanuel Jakobovits, ``waived any religious objection'' to
demolishing the Ohel Leah synagogue, said Robert Dorfman, a
synagogue leader.
   Synagogue trustees want to demolish the building and erect two
40-story towers and a new synagogue on the site.

<HEAD>Oregon Cuts Off Funds for Transplants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To Sheila Holladay, Oregon legislators all
but voted to end her 2-year-old son's life by cutting off funds
that would have paid for a bone marrow transplant.
   So she left southern Oregon this spring to seek welfare funds
for a transplant operation in Washington, where her son David is
awaiting a transplant at that state's expense.
   ``I left my home. I left my dog. I left my life,'' Holladay
said. ``This was extremely frustrating because we had a home there,
we had school there, we had our lives set up there.''
   Her supporters in Oregon raised about $5,000 of the $100,000
needed.
   Oregon lawmakers voted last summer to finance only cornea and
kidney transplants, joining a minority of states that don't pay for
transplant operations such as those of hearts, bone marrow and
livers.
   The move drew little notice, until 7-year-old Coby Howard of
Portland died Dec. 2 of leukemia as his relatives were raising
private contributions for a marrow transplant.
   The resulting furor helped persuade the Legislative Emergency
Board, which handles budget matters between sessions, to take up
the issue. But the board voted against using emergency funds to
reverse the Legislature's action.
   As a compromise, the panel created what's believed to be the
nation's first transplant payment program to be financed by a
combination of federal funds and private donations.
   The program is triggered when $85,000 in donations are turned
over to the state.
   Some backers of restoring state financing said the compromise
was better than nothing. Others were critical.
   ``I really think it was a spineless decision on the part of the
state,'' said Tammi Howard, Coby's mother.
   Howard is leading a petition drive to put a measure requiring
the state to resume transplant financing on November's ballot.
   ``The fact that the state stood by and let a little boy die like
that has stirred up a lot of emotions,'' she said. ``If it was up
to the public, all of these people would have transplants and would
be on the road to recovery by now.''
   Susan McGee, Coby's aunt, deplored a process in which she coaxed
the boy to perform for television in his final days in attempts to
raise money.
   ``I asked him to smile for the camera when, not 30 minutes
before, he had been vomiting due to his illness,'' McGee said. ``I
had to turn Coby Howard into a marketable product so the public
would, in essence, buy him his life.''
   Relatives and friends had raised about $70,000 toward the cost
of the operation by the time he died.
   Forty-one states pay for bone marrow transplants, 36 pay for
heart transplants and about 40 finance liver transplants, said
Jeane Thorne, director of the state transplant program.
   Oregon spent about $500,000 toward 19 heart, pancreas, marrow
and liver transplants in the two-year budget period that ended last
June 30.
   Federal Medicaid funds pay 62 percent of the cost of transplants
for qualified recipients. Thorne had projected the growth in demand
for transplants would push the state's cost to about $800,000 this
year.
   Senate President John Kitzhaber, a physician and co-chair of the
emergency board, opposes renewed state financing for transplants.
He says limited health care dollars must be spent in a way that
will do the most good.
   That standard favors funding prenatal care for many low-income
women instead of financing costly and sometimes risky operations
for a few people, he said.
   ``We cannot keep people alive forever. That is a part of life,''
Kitzhaber said at one meeting. ``What we can do with our limited
money is to try to reduce the number of deaths ... to save as many
people as we can save.''
   Rep. Tom Mason, who hopes to restore state funds, said the
publicity has disgraced Oregon.
   ``The national image that this controversy has brought to the
state is horrendous,'' Mason said.
   ``How many more people actually have to die?'' he asked at the
board's first meeting on restoring the funds.
   ``There's no logic to spend money on prenatal care and then let
them die after they're born,'' Mason said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard, Customs Have Built Drug-Fighting Armada Over The
Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress has provided for a state-of-the-art
civilian air and sea force to hunt down drug boats and planes even
as lawmakers try to draft a reluctant Pentagon to lead the fight
against narcotics smugglers.
   Customs Service and Coast Guard patrols use some of the nation's
most sophisticated radars, patrol boats and aircraft. Customs has
helicopters with ``bust'' teams that swoop down on drug planes as
soon as they touch down.
   The Customs air wing now has 87 aircraft, 37 of them with the
sophisticated equipment or speed to spot a suspicious aircraft,
track it on radar, pursue it, and move in for the kill with Army
Blackhawk helicopters.
   A P3 turboprop surveillance plane to be delivered to Customs
next month will have high-tech radar with a full 360-degree range.
Customs has four other P3s with sophisticated radar systems.
   Customs also operates four tethered radar balloons, called
aerostats, and has four on order for the nation's Southwest border
from Texas to California _ currently the most porous area in air
coverage against drug smugglers.
   The Coast Guard uses much of its 245-cutter fleet for drug
missions, and also has new, fast patrol boats _ 16 in service and
21 on order. The agency also utilizes three fast boats that skim
the water, similar to hovercraft; two E2C surveillance planes,
which are the Navy version of the Air Force's AWACS; and 22
long-range C130 turboprop surveillance aircraft. Nine twin-engine
Falcon jets are being refitted with interceptor radar.
   The Coast Guard also operates an aerostat with another four on
the way, and flies helicopters for Bahamian law enforcement teams
fighting drug smugglers.
   To ensure sophisticated communications, coordinated radar
coverage and up-to-the minute intelligence, the federal government
is building three command, control, communications and intelligence
centers in the Miami area, Oklahoma City, and at March Air Force
Base in Riverside, Calif.
   Despite this formidable buildup, agency officials and lawmakers
agree that it hasn't stopped drugs from pouring into the United
States.
   Congress is trying to even the playing field with legislation
that would require more help from a military that has been wary of
draining its resources and reluctant to take on a civilian law
enforcement role.
   Both houses have passed legislation by wide margins to force the
Pentagon to do more, notwithstanding the 16,288 hours the military
says it flew in support of drug law enforcement in 1987.
   Final language will be worked out in a House-Senate conference
on the Defense Department budget authorization bill.
   The civilian buildup, while significant, has been anything but
steady.
   The Coast Guard operating and acquisition budget for the drug
war grew just from $509 million in fiscal 1984 to a high of $557
million in fiscal 1987.
   But the figure for fiscal 1988 is down to $514 million, and has
forced a 55 percent cutback in hours devoted to drug patrols.
   ``The drug people have to know our vessels are at the dock and
planes are not flying,'' said Vice Adm. James Irwin of the Coast
Guard. ``Seizures are down.''
   His agency is waiting for Congress to pass a $60 million
supplemental appropriation so that full patrols can resume.
   The Customs air wing has had better luck, with a budget that
grew from $64.8 million in fiscal 1984 to $163 million in fiscal
1988.
   But Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Rep. Glenn English,
D-Okla., said they often fought bitterly with the military to equip
the air wing.
   ``We went through holy hell,'' said DeConcini, who heads the
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Customs Service

<HEAD>Planning A Summit in Moscow: `It's Just Different From Working
Here'</HEAD>

   James Hooley has planned presidential travel
to most of the 50 states and 18 foreign countries, including the
economic summits in Tokyo and Venice. But President Reagan's trip
to the Soviet Union this week was different.
   Preliminary preparations for the Moscow summit began in 1985
after Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met in Geneva
and said they wanted to visit each other's country.
   ``It's a whole different mind set,'' Hooley, director of
presidential advance, said of the Soviets. ``They don't deal with
the kind of things we deal with.
   ``We are constantly pushing and urging and prodding for things
that are just sort of anathema to their system.''
   For instance, there was the matter of the private dinner Reagan
and Gorbachev are having at a country home outside Moscow.
   The Soviets insisted there be no press coverage. Hooley
reluctantly agreed, but said there should at least be an official
photographer. The Soviets said no.
   ``I can't seem to get them to grasp the concept that this is an
incredibly historic thing, or potentially historic, these guys
eating dinner out there in this house in the country,'' Hooley said
in a recent interview. ``It would be like having a picture of
Roosevelt and Stalin.
   ``They just don't think like that. You really sense that
instinctively there's a pullback from anything that's going to be
other than exactly like how they do it and how they've done it for
years and years, and that's, of course, very closed.''
   Hooley believes, however, that Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness, does seem to be having some effect.
   ``There's a bit more than I expected of a willingness to let us
work directly with ... some of the people at the places where we
are going,'' he said. For example, he said, the advance team was
able to work directly with the management of the House of Writers,
which Reagan will be visiting.''
   He added, ``I don't think we were turned down from seeing
anything that we requested to see.
   ``On the other hand, you run into this kind of block with no
explanation on certain issues as to why, once you are there in
these places, you can't do certain things. The security people can
override everybody else ... and they don't feel a need to explain
the reason.''
   Hooley said the initial preparations for the summit consisted
mainly of checking with people who had been involved in Moscow
visits before, including some members of the Nixon administration.
   More active preparations began after the two superpower leaders
met in Washington in December and announced that Reagan would visit
Moscow sometime in the spring.
   Over a period of approximately two months leading up to the
summit, three advance teams visited Moscow, one more than usual.
   For a domestic trip, as when the president goes to Chicago or
New London, Conn., one person from the advance offices makes the
initial survey, checking out proposed speech sites with an eye to
establishing communications, security and the other facilities
needed for a presidential visit.
   On a foreign trip, this group is increased to about 10 or l2
senior people who ``get a few concepts agreed to'' in consultation
with their counterparts from the host country, Hooley said.
   The final advance team, whether the president is going to
Baltimore or Bali, is a larger group of maybe 45 to 50, including
technical people, to make specific arrangements.
   In the case of the summit, Hooley, Director of Communications
Thomas C. Griscom and Jack Courtemanche, first lady Nancy Reagan's
chief of staff, made an extra visit ``to negotiate the finer points
of the schedule,'' the advance official said.
   The ``ambiguous phrase'' used by people who had been to the
Soviet Union suddenly became clear, Hooley said. ``They'd say,
`It's just different from working here.'''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal for a joint mission
to Mars ``has to be studied carefully'' and may be taken up under a
U.S.-Soviet space agreement.
   ``That's something that's been talked about, but it's a long way
from being agreed upon,'' Shultz said, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This
Week With David Brinkley.''
   Gorbachev, in an interview with The Washington Post and Newsweek
published Sunday, said he would ask President Reagan to approve a
joint, unmanned flight to Mars when they meet in Moscow for their
May 29-June 2 summit.
   Asked if the United States would pursue such a venture, Shultz
noted the superpowers reached an agreement on space ventures about
a year ago under which particular projects are examined.
   ``I presume this will come up under that heading,'' Shultz said
Sunday, adding, ``Obviously this has to be studied carefully. We
always have to be careful with problems of technology transfer.''
   NASA's Samuel W. Keller said Sunday he had told Soviets
scientists 10 days ago about a U.S. decision in principle to take
Soviet Mars-probe equipment along on a U.S. space launch in 1992.
   Keller, the space agency's deputy associate administrator for
space sciences, told The Washington Post that under the U.S. offer,
the unmanned U.S. ``Mars Observer'' spacecraft would carry a Soviet
receiver. If the U.S. craft still were operating when a 1994 Soviet
spacecraft seeks to land on Mars, the Soviet receiver would improve
transmissions to Moscow, he said.
   The secretary of state also urged the Senate to approve the
U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles in time
for the summit.
   ``It helps certainly to have completed something and to register
that fact. ... It's good to register the fact that we can do it,''
Shultz said.
   The secretary, sidestepping any criticism of the president's
conservative allies who oppose the treaty, lauded the Senate for
its thorough consideration of the pact.
   ``I think the process has gone well. I have only compliments for
the Senate and the way in which they've handled this,'' he said,
adding, ``I think there's been a time for hearings, a time for
questions, a time for critiques and a time for debate. There also
has to come a time to decide and I think we're about there.''
   The pact, formally known as the Treaty on Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces, was signed by the two leaders at their December
summit in Washington.
   Both the president and administration officials are eager to
have the ratified treaty as a boost for negotiations with the
Soviet side.
   The Senate has turned aside a wave of amendments designed by its
conservative opponents to kill the treaty, and debate is expected
to continue through much of the week. Approval of the pact requires
67 votes, if all 100 senators are present.
   The secretary of state also echoed the positive remarks
Gorbachev made in the interview with U.S. reporters, in which the
Soviet leader said he hoped he could sign an agreement slashing in
half the superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons before
Reagan leaves office.
   ``It's certainly possible,'' Shultz said of prospects for such a
treaty. ``And I feel certain that at the Moscow summit we will both
want to agree to keep working on it hard. But whether it will
actually happen or not, I don't know. The issues are tough.''
   Queried about talks on the disputed Strategic Defense
Initiative, which has hampered agreement on a strategic missile
pact, Shultz said Reagan has staunchly opposed any impediment to
the development of a defense against ballistic missiles.
   ``That still leaves room for a lot of things,'' the secretary
said.

   Some of the 4,700 Firestone Inc. employees in
six states who had been on strike returned to work late Sunday
after negotiators reached tentative agreement with the United
Rubber Workers on a new contract.
   Union spokesman Curt Brown said ratification votes on the
three-year contract would be held this week at Firestone offices
and plants in Akron; Noblesville, Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur,
Ill.; Russellville, Ark., and Oklahoma City.
   Workers at Decatur, Russellville and Nobelsville plants started
to return to work Sunday night. Workers in Akron were expected to
be back on the job Tuesday morning.
   The URW members struck May 15 after Firestone declined to accept
the cost-of-living allowance provided in an industry pattern
agreement the union negotiated with Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
   Brown said the new contract followed the Goodyear pattern
reached May 17.
   ``Our major goal had been to keep pattern bargaining, and that
had been all we really asked from Firestone,'' Brown said. ``This
isn't really a greedy contract.''
   Firestone spokesman Robert Troyer said, ``We believe this is a
fair and realistic contract for our employees. The agreement
recognizes the particular needs of Firestone's tire operation.''
   He said the company was optimistic for early ratification of the
contract.
   Under the agreement, Firestone would:
   _ Maintain cost-of-living allowances in each year, with a
one-cent hourly increase for every increase of 0.26 in the Consumer
Price Index.
   _ Boost wages 25 cents per hour by deducting that amount from
future cost-of-living adjustments in increments of 10, 10 and 5
cents.
   _Increase retirement pensions for current workers by $3.50 to
$23.50 per month for each year of service. In addition, current
retirees would receive a lump sum bonus of $200 before Dec. 1.
   _ Provide choice of first-dollar health insurance coverage or an
80-20 percent co-payment plan that includes a $1,000 enrollment
incentive bonus.
   _ Make 35 percent matching contributions in the employee savings
plan that is part of the 80-20 comprehensive health plan. Both
plans provide for a 401-K savings plan.
   In addition, the pact assures continuation of the contract if a
Firestone plant is sold to another company during the next three
years, and contains a no-strike wage reopener clause in the third
year.
   Negotiations resumed Saturday at 1:15 p.m. with the assistance
of federal mediator David Thorley and an agreement was reached at 5
a.m. It was the only session held since the strike began May 15.
   The strike was the first involving Firestone since 1976, when
the URW struck all the Akron-based rubber companies except General
Tire.
   In a related development, the union said a contract covering
15,000 Goodyear workers was ratified Sunday when Local 2 in Akron,
which represents 1,700 members, ``overwhelmingly approved'' the
agreement.
   Brown said seven of eleven locals at Goodyear had voted on the
contract. Six locals representing a total of 8,060 members had
approved it, and one with 231 members rejected it.
   Ratification had been assured Friday when a URW local in
Danville, Va., voted by 72 percent to 28 percent to accept the
pact. It was the second Goodyear proposal to be put to a vote.
   URW members at three other Goodyear locals also were scheduled
to vote Sunday. They had approved the inital contract proposal.
   Under the URW constitution, contracts must be approved by ``a
majority of union locals representing a majority of members.''

<HEAD>Fighting For The Black Vote: New Jersey Primary Race Provides
Microcosm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The black vote, which has gone almost
unanimously to Jesse Jackson so far, is becoming more of a wild
card as Michael Dukakis tightens his grip on the Democratic
nomination and both parties look ahead to the fall election.
   New Jersey, which holds its primary June 7 along with
California, Montana and New Mexico to finish out the Democratic
primary season, is a case in point.
   Blacks make up about 10 percent of the state's 3.7 million
registered voters. And Dukakis, who has worked hard to avoid
alienating Jackson's supporters, is hoping to claim a share of the
black voting bloc in the primary _ a share he hopes will increase
dramatically in November.
   George Bush, assured of the Republican nomination, also has the
fall contest in mind as he woos the state's blacks. Gov. Thomas
Kean, a Bush backer, has shown strong support among blacks, and the
vice president is hoping that will translate into some votes for
him.
   Dukakis is heavily favored to win the New Jersey Democratic
primary, perhaps with 70 percent or more of the Democratic vote.
Jackson's strength appears to be concentrated in highly urban areas.
   The closest contests, Democrats say, will be in about half a
dozen so-called ``delegate districts,'' where voters will elect a
total of 71 delegates pledged to one of the two candidates.
   Such skirmishes, of course, are small in comparison to the
battle that looms in November. Pollster Lou Harris says he believes
blacks could effectively pick the next president.
   A strong turnout by blacks, traditionally Democratic by an
overwhelming margin, could break a Bush-Dukakis tie, Harris said.
   ``Race will be a front-and-center issue,'' Harris told a New
York forum last week on the black vote.
   Jackson supporters in New Jersey say their drive to register new
voters for the primary might pay off for the Democrats in the state
in November, helping win back support captured by Kean in 1985.
   Party leaders also are working hard to head off tension between
the Dukakis and Jackson camps. While competition in advance of the
primary has been healthy, it has not been nasty.
   The candidates themselves met amiably a week ago at the party's
state convention in South Orange.
   State Democratic chairman Ray Durkin says he believes black
voters will return to the Democratic fold, despite going heavily
for a Republican candidate three years ago.
   ``They were for Tom Kean,'' Durkin says. ``They weren't for the
Republican Party. ... I think we're getting them back.''
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, chairman of Jackson's New Jersey
campaign, says he believes both Democrats and Republicans have
become wiser as a result of Jackson's pioneering candidacy.
   ``On both sides, there's a learning taking place,'' he said.
Blacks, he said, are no longer just a voting bloc, but a political
force.
   ``We're growing of age,'' said James.

   Here are excerpts of the face-to-face
interview conducted Wednesday between Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and senior executives and editors of The Washington Post
and Newsweek, and written answers to questions submitted to
Gorbachev in March.
   The excerpts are taken from the transcript which was prepared by
the Post from the original English and Russian language used during
the interview. The excerpts from the written questions and answers
are taken from the English language text supplied by the Soviet
government.
   Q:(Katharine Graham, chairman of the board of The Washington
Post Co.) Well, we are aware that you are following many things, in
particular events in our country, and that you read a lot and
remember everything (laughter).
   A: Well, someone recommended me very well to you. I must extend
to you Mrs. Gorbachev's warmest regards.
   Q: Thank you. We had such a nice meeting in Washington. I was
hoping perhaps to be able to see her here, but if not please give
her my best regards.
   A: She is not an easily manageable person (laughter).
   Q: They say that about all of us.
   A: There is an interesting phrase, I think, of (Friedrich)
Engels'. He used to say that a woman is an entire civilization. ...
   Q: Looking ahead to the party conference, we'd like your
personal reaction to a number of specific proposals. For example,
do you support the idea of fixed terms of office for party leaders,
and, if so, would that include the position of general secretary
itself?
   A: Well, you'll hear the answers in the coming days to all such
questions. But I would say one word: Yes.
   Q: We hope you'll say a little more than one word (laughter).
   A: Well, let me anticipate what you are going to read in the
papers in five or six days. The Washington Post wants to find out
earlier.
   Q: This is Newsweek.
   A: Your empire, then, wants to know things earlier.
   Q: Our empire is competitive within itself also, like all
empires.
   Q: The interest in the party conference is so great, could you
not perhaps, even in more general terms, discuss your hopes for
this meeting, which is obviously such an important event.
   A: I certainly think that my expectations coincide with the
expectations of our whole society. First of all, we want to take
stock of what has happened over these three years, to sort out the
history of perestroika, and, of course, we want that analysis of
this period to be a critical one. We want to draw lessons _ perhaps
that will be necessary. And based on that analysis, we may have to
take some corrective measures in what we are doing in perestroika.
But I think that the central question is the question of how to
deepen this process, how to move forward with perestroika and make
it irreversible. Therefore, the main questions at the conference
will relate to deepening the economic reform and to deepening the
democraticization of our party and society. This is the main thing.
As for the rest of it, I think you will find out more.
   Q: Soviet editors have told us that Mr. (Yegor) Ligachev
endorsed the article in Sovyetskaya Rossiya that had some praise
for the Stalin era. You personally endorsed an editorial in Pravda
that refuted the Sovyetskaya Rossiya article. Can you tell us if
the Sovyetskaya Rossiya article reflected Mr. Ligachev's views
(this second reference to the Sovyetskaya Rossiya article and
Ligachev was dropped, apparently inadvertently, when the
interpreter put this question to Gorbachev in Russian), and does
this exchange suggest that there is a serious difference of opinion
in the leadership about how far glasnost should go and the view of
the Stalin era itself?
   A: Well, my impression is that this whole theme of deep
divisions in the Soviet leadership as to perestroika, as to the
prospects of perestroika and the evaluation of the past, is being
pushed not by Soviet editors but by the western media. That's my
first reaction.
   I don't know the motives behind the fact that this is
systematically tossed up, and is then broadcast by various
``voices'' (foreign radio stations) in Russian and other languages
into our country. ...
   The current leadership of the Soviet Union _ including the
Politburo and the government _ was formed basically after April
1985, when we set out on the course of perestroika, and all our
leaders, both our political leaders and government leaders, are
committed to perestroika and are actively involved in designing and
implementing perestroika. ...

<TEXT>
   When such huge undertakings as perestroika take place, when we
need to develop not only the strategy but also the tactics of
moving forward, that requires not only active dialogue in the
leadership but in the whole society. And that is what has been
happening. The whole country is now an enormous debating society.
   And it is natural that in the leadership itself there is lively
and constant discussion within the framework of perestroika seeking
answers to those questions that have been put on the agenda by us.
   Jesus Christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew how to
feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread. We don't possess that
skill, we have no ready prescription to solve all our problems
quickly. We, together with our society, are seeking answers to all
questions. And this is accompanied by discussions, and sometimes by
heated debate, and that is normal. Our problem has been that for
many years there was no such debate in the society, in the party,
not in the Central Committee, not in the government itself or in
the Politburo. This absence of debate led to many losses, mistakes
and omissions.
   To present these discussions _ which are a normal part of the
democratic process _ as division within the leadership would be a
great mistake itself. Maybe some people want there to be
disagreement, even want the leadership to quarrel and to be split,
but that's something quite different. That has no connection to the
actual characteristics of the leadership in our country.
   Q: In your very interesting written answers to us, you called
freedom of speech ``indispensable,'' yet some Soviet citizens still
get into trouble with the authorities for what looks to us like
attempts to exercise freedom of speech. Paruir Arikyan in Armenia
and Sergei Grigoryants in Moscow (editors of a new unofficial
magazine called Glasnost) are recent examples. Is this because some
of your authorities don't get ``the new thinking'' or is this
because that sort of, the things that those people have done is not
something you consider expression of freedom of speech?
   A: ... The most interesting things that perestroika has
demonstrated is that our people, while being firmly in favor of the
renewal of society, and of change, have firmly expressed the view
that changes could happen only within the boundaries of socialism,
and on the basis of socialist values.
   Even advances in the economic sphere like cooperatives, cost
accountability, leasing and individual enterprise, all of this is
being discussed seriously, even scrupulously, in our society.
People ask, ``Is this not a retreat from the principles of
socialism?'' Some ask if we are undermining the principles of
socialism. And that is because 90 percent of the people living
today in the Soviet Union were born and have been raised under
socialism. And the present leadership only wants to try to develop
this socialist system which opened the way for us in all spheres of
life. We know socialism, we know its achievements and its problems.
And we are going to work within the boundaries of the socialism we
have chosen.
   That is why everything that evokes in people anxiety that
someone has tossed up other values, including in the ideological
sphere, this evokes a critical reaction. That is also the
democratic process. Democracy is like that.
   People here know that the Grigoryants ``organization,'' is tied
not only organizationally but also financially to the West, that
his constant visitors and guests are Western correspondents.
Therefore people think of him as some kind of alien phenomenon in
our society sponging on the democratic process, sponging on the
positive aspects of perestroika.
   This happens _ it happens in nature, too. There are such
parasites living off healthy organisms and attempting to harm them.
...
   I have said that perestroika is a kind of melting pot that will
make our society stronger, that will reveal its democratic, human
potential, all in the interest of man. And that which some suggest
_ that we look for our future in different values and liquidate
socialist property, etc. _ our people reject. This will not be
accepted _ it is an illusion. And you must know this.

   Q: In your written answers you say that you would welcome
another meeting with Mr. Reagan to sign an agreement on a 50
percent reduction in strategic offensive weapons. Is this agreement
on a 50 percent reduction so important and so close to completion
now that it could be signed while negotiations on space defenses
and on other problems such as sea-launched cruise missiles continue?
   A: Well, we are very much and fundamentally committed to
decisive reductions in nuclear arms, and therefore we want to see
the agreement on 50 percent reductions in strategic offensive
forces. We want to have that signed. In our assessment we have
covered together a long road in the search for conclusions to all
questions. But I think you would agree with me that if I say that
if we sign with one hand a treaty reducing strategic offensive
forces in one area and at the same time launch an arms race in
space or at sea, what would be the point? That would be senseless.
   ... If we just replace one kind of arms race with another,
particularly in space, where the arms race would take a
particularly dramatic turn, we would undermine the trust that has
begun to be built, we would make worthless all the experience that
we have accumulated at the Geneva negotiations. This new kind of
arms race, new sphere for an arms race, new criteria _ it would
take decades to reach some kind of agreement and come to an
agreement.
   I think that he who pushes for an arms race in space is
committing a crime against the people _ his own people, and others.
That must be said with all responsibility, and with clarity. Such
an approach, such an idea, is a road to destabilization, to
unpredictability on matters of security. This must be condemned,
the initiator of such an approach must be pilloried.
   And sea-launched cruise missiles _ this would also be a
roundabout maneuver that could become a new avenue for the arms
race. And therefore, we are linking all those questions together
and we believe that this is a fair approach. What is more, I have
to say that we see genuine possibilities to resolve all those
questions, to resolve all of them together and to have a treaty on
a 50 percent reduction of strategic offensive arms and then to
continue farther.

   Q: The reason behind my question is that there has been movement
on both sides toward agreement. I thought perhaps that there's been
enough movement on the question of SDI (Strategic Defense
Initiative) and that now the Washington declaration (at the
December summit) could perhaps serve to come to the final great
problem ... on SDI; which is the difference over what happens at
the end of the adherence period. Does the Washington declaration
solve the conflict over what happens at the end of the adherence
period?
   A: I believe that which is contained in the statement on the
understanding of the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) treaty in the
form that was accepted in 1972 and as we understood it until 1983 _
that does provide a basis to move forward toward 50 percent
reductions in strategic offensive arms. But only in that way, in no
other.
   I haven't answered the other part of your question. We will work
with any American administration on this important aspect of
Soviet-American relations. I have in mind the process of
negotations in the context of the Geneva talks to find a way to
agree on a new treaty to reduce nuclear arms. If that happens
during the Reagan administration, we would welcome that. If that
happens after the election, with the new president, then so be it.
We are ready to work. We don't want to waste any time. We are
prepared to continue. It is up to the United States side now.
   (Gorbachev rose from his desk at this point and moved to a shelf
to retrieve a model of a Soviet rocket.) We are going to invite the
president _ and I would like to say in conclusion _ to cooperate on
a flight to Mars. Here is a model of that rocket. These are
pictures of the launching of that rocket (pointing to color
photographs on the wall of his office) sent to me from the
cosmodrome in Baikonur, which I visited last year. The rocket last
year lifted 100 tons into orbit. After certain modernizations it
will be able to carry 200 tons. Now we are lifting 20 tons.
   Why shouldn't we try to work together? We have great experience,
you have great experience _ let us cooperate to master the cosmos,
to fulfill big programs. And whatever is being done in outer space
and whatever is being done in SDI to achieve new technological
breakthroughs. As a result of a joint project to study Halley's
comet, we have been able to develop dozens of new materials, we
have been able to make major advances in electronics and in
mathematics. This resulted really in major scientific
breakthroughs. This is a field for cooperation that would be worthy
of the Soviet and American peoples. And I will make that proposal
to President Reagan.

<NOTE>EDS: This take begins the written questions and answers.</NOTE>
<HEAD>WASHN: President Reagan.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of the written questions and answers. In their
written response, the Soviets revised some of the questions. Where
the questions differ significantly, parts of the original questions
submitted by the Post appear in parenthesis.
   Q: Have the three meetings with President Reagan changed your
ideas as to how peaceful cooperation (competition) between
capitalist and socialist countries should be regulated in the
future? How do you think the forthcoming summit will contribute to
stabilizing that competition? ...
   A: I am convinced that positive trends are unfolding in the
world. There is a turn from confrontation to coexistence. The winds
of the Cold War are being replaced by the winds of hope. And I see
that a significant role in that process is being played by the
signs of improvement in the relations between the United States and
the Soviet Union. All over the world there is an acute need for
change or, if you wish, a need for restructuring international
relations. In that situation it is essential to continue positive
contacts between the East and the West. ...
   As for the potential results of the upcoming fourth meeting with
the president and, notably, the prospects for a detailed agreement
on a 50 percent cut in strategic offensive weapons, the past few
months and weeks have seen so much speculation that I would like to
make the following point: Be patient, the meeting is just a few
days away, let the president and I work together. Whatever we
arrive at will certainly not be concealed from the public. ...
   If an agreement on a 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive
weapons comes to be drafted under the present U.S. administration,
I see no reason why President Reagan and I should not sign it. I
would certainly welcome that.
   Q: Many people in the West think that nuclear weapons have been
instrumental in maintaining stability in the world over the past
few decades. Would it not be more rational for the U.S.S.R. and the
U.S. in those conditions to agree on preserving minimal nuclear
deterrents? ...
   A: I cannot agree with those who think that the drive for a
nuclear-free world is hopeless.
   I have argued more than once with representatives of the West
over their case that without nuclear weapons we would never have
survived for 40 years without another world war. This is just a
conjecture. But what about a sober evaluation of the real role
played by the so-called ``balance of fear?'' It has given us
nothing but unheard-of militarization of foreign policies,
economies and even intellectual life. It has caused damage in the
sphere of international morality and ethics and has killed the
atmosphere of mutual trust, friendliness and sincere interest in
each other which was born in Soviet-American relations in the years
of joint warfare and victory over fascism.
   I am convinced that strategic military parity can be maintained
at a low level and without nuclear weapons. We have clearly
formulated our choice: to stop, then reverse the arms race.
   As for the so-called ``minimal nuclear deterrence,'' I will not
argue now with the proponents of that idea. So far, you and we have
more than 10,000 warheads each in our strategic arsenals. Let us
first cut them by 50 percent. Maybe then by another 50 percent and
then once again. In the meantime, let us come to terms on the
elimination of chemical weapons and start reducing conventional
armaments in Europe. That process should be open not only for the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. but for all other nuclear and nonnuclear
states. That will be an important incentive for the
demilitarization of politics, ways of thinking and international
relations in general. ...
   Q: The NATO leaders have announced that even with a balance in
the conventional forces (if a parity of conventional forces were
achieved) in Europe, nuclear weapons will still need to be
preserved on the continent as a means of retaliation (would still
be needed in Europe to pose an unacceptable risk for an aggressor).
If, in keeping with that position, nuclear disarmament is
unacceptable for the West, should we not try to reach a joint
agreement on the terms of modernization of the tactical nuclear
weapons deployed in Europe? ...
   A: The talk about nuclear weapons on the continent as a means of
retaliation is the same old concept of a ``limited'' nuclear war in
Europe. It absolutely contradicts what I conferred with the U.S.
president about back in Geneva-notably, that nuclear war cannot be
won and simply must not be allowed to happen. ...
   We support the ideas of nuclear-free zones in northern Europe
and in the Balkans. We are also in favor of a 300-kilometer
corridor free of all nuclear and any other heavy weapons in central
Europe. I am naming just some ideas but certainly not all. ...

<HEAD>WASHN: not all.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: NATO suggested cutting tens of thousands of nonnuclear
weapons that could be used for surprise or large-scale offensive
operations. Does this approach fall within the boundaries of your
stated willingness to negotiate on the basis of asymmetrical
reductions?
   A: On our side, there are no obstacles to that. As for the
existing asymmetries in the arsenals of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty,
I have already expressed my views on that score many times:
Asymmetries exist on both sides. We stand for the elimination of
asymmetry on the basis of reciprocity. For example, the Warsaw
Treaty armies have more tanks. And the NATO armies have more attack
planes. The Soviet Union and our allies are ready to eliminate
these and other asymmetries without delay but, let me repeat, on
the basis of reciprocity. And then it would be possible to balance
armaments on the lowest possible level sufficient only for defense.
...
   We are not satisfied with the pace of the Vienna consultations
of the 23 countries elaborating the objective and format of the
future conference. If the work in Vienna proceeds in the same
on-again, off-again manner, Europe will have to wait for a long
time for those asymmetries to be eliminated. ...
   Q: In the months remaining of the Reagan presidency, what is
required to broaden your personal relationship with the president
into an institutional relationship and carry both into the future?
   A: The experience of present-day international relations shows
the paramount importance of meetings between leaders of states, all
the more so when the case in point is the United States and the
Soviet Union. Since both countries are well aware of the need for
intensifying the dialogue and improving relations, it is absolutely
obvious that it is not only the leaders' personal views that
matter. This is the imperative of our time. This is the striving of
our peoples. Such is the constant in the Soviet-American dialogue.
... we are interested in developing the dialogue, we will strive to
make it more productive, we will try to facilitate the
``adaptation'' of the next U.S. administration to contacts with us,
and will do everything within our power to keep the process begun
in Geneva in 1985 from stopping. And, naturally enough, we hope for
the same attitude on the American side.
   Q: Do you feel President Reagan is a different kind of American
leader? ...
   A: ... I'm not particularly fond of giving personal character
references. But since you ask, I would like to say that realism is
an important quality in President Reagan as a politician. By this I
mean the ability to adapt one's views to the changing situation,
while remaining faithful to one's convictions. ...
   Q: The Americans are familiar with the rapid erosion that
occurred in the situation in Vietnam once they decided to withdraw
from that war. (How does the Soviet Union propose to avoid such an
erosion now that the outline of the withdrawal from Afghanistan has
been drawn? If attacks on Soviet units increase during the
withdrawal, what military response will the Soviet Union make?)
What changes, in your view, will take place in Afghanistan in the
next year while the Soviet Union is pulling out its troops? What
will the Soviet Union's contribution to bringing about those
changes be? ...
   A: Any parallel between Vietnam and Afghanistan is artificial.
Not to mention how different the nature of the conflicts is. I
would only like to remind you of the fact that prior to the
Americans pulling out of Vietnam, that country was divided for 20
years into two nearly equal parts by a border along the 17th
Parallel. In both sections, there existed governments personifying
regimes opposite in nature and incompatible in aim.
   There is nothing of that kind in Afghanistan. On the contrary,
the government there has set itself the goal of achieving the
Afghan people's national reconciliation and, on this basis, its own
reorganization into a coalition government with the participation
of all parties to the conflict.
   It goes without saying that the future depends in many respects
on how honestly and consistently all the signatories to the Geneva
agreements will meet the commitments assumed, without their trying
to get around them in some way or another or deceive their partners.
   I can reaffirm once again that the Soviet Union intends to meet
its obligations precisely and undeviatingly. ...
   Q: You said that when the Afghan knot is untied, it will have
the most profound impact on other regional conflicts, too. Is the
Soviet Union prepared to cooperate with the United States and other
countries in resolving other conflicts, for example in Central
America, the Persian Gulf and Angola?
   A: Yes, it is prepared. I have already said that, given
constructive cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United
States and major emphasis on the prestige and capabilities of the
United Nations, its Security Council and other bodies, political
settlement of regional conflicts and prevention of new ones will
gradually become an international practice, a norm. I would like to
confirm this conviction of mine. ...

<HEAD>Last Days For Residents of Dwindling Trailer Park at Walden Pond</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henry Caswell cooks his dinner every
night, takes a drive once a day and is eager to show off the
trailer he has occupied across from Walden Pond for more than 40
years.
   Caswell, 94, is cheerful about his life and surroundings here in
a wooded area writer Henry Thoreau made famous. But there is a pall
that hangs over the rustic trailer park.
   Walden Breezes is dying.
   When the state acquired the land 10 years ago, the owner
insisted that the residents of the park called Walden Breezes have
life tenancy. But the state ruled that vacant trailers must be
removed. State officials plan to make the trailer park part of
Walden Pond State Park after the last resident has died or moved
away.
   As a result, long cement slabs are all that remain of many
trailer homes in the park. Caswell's home is one of only 20 in
Walden Breezes, which onced housed 70 trailers.
   But residents say they are used to the dwindling number of
neighbors, in part because they all cherish their independence. But
Caswell's closest friend, James S. Swaffield, who lives across the
park and ``will talk you blind if you let him,'' is sometimes
nostalgic for the old days when Walden Breezes was bustling and
family-filled.
   ```People are moving away or dying,'' said Swaffield, who also
lives alone in his trailer. ``Every now and then you get a call
that someone's passed on.''
   Caswell and Swaffield moved to Walden Breezes after their wives
died, and spend most of their time alone. As recently as last year
they fished together at Walden Pond almost daily.
   Most of Walden Breezes' remaining residents have outlived their
neighbors and their spouses.
   Ed Johnson, 80, a widower for three years, still wears his
wedding band. He is philosophical about the sense of finality of
Walden Breezes.
   ``It's kind of like, here today, gone tomorrow,'' said Johnson,
pausing between a strenuous raking of leaves around his trailer.
``When someone dies, they just go ahead and sell all the articles
inside and get rid of the ... thing.''
   Johnson said he still feels ``young at heart'' and has resisted
attempts by his children to move in with them.
   ``This is a place where elderly people can live independently,''
he said. ``Most people should realize that we don't have to be put
away.''
   Independence at Walden Breezes is so strong that remarriage
among the widows and widowers is uncommon.
   ``No, I can't see why I would,'' said Flora Haskett, 75, a
29-year resident whose husband died five years ago. ``We all know
each other but it's more like friends. No romance.''
   Haskett and one of her best friends, Annie Weston, 77, often
miss the old days at the park. But fishing is not what they
remember most fondly.
   ``We used to have great parties by the lake or picnics by
someone's mobile home,'' said Mrs. Haskett, who lives in a fancy
one-bedroom trailer with a mirrored living room. ``Now we're all
being phased out.''

<HEAD>WASHN: of mine.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Recalling her talks with you, Mrs. (Margaret) Thatcher drew a
comparison between the criticism and resistance a western leader
faces in bringing change and what you have encountered in pushing
perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness). ... by
glasnost you seem to mean something different from what we think of
as freedom of speech. Could you elaborate on the differences?
   A: ... What is taking place in the U.S.S.R. is an all-embracing
process of revolutionary renovation of socialist society on the
basis of the historic choice which we do not doubt and which proved
in principle the only correct one for our people 70 years ago. ...
Of course, combating stagnation in the course of perestroika and
dismantling the mechanism of retardation require that sluggishness
and conservatism be overcome. Sometimes we are confronted with
hectic impatience. There is also conscious resistance on the part
of those whose narrow selfish interests are incompatible with
perestroika, socially, economically or morally.
   However, this is precisely what we mean by perestroika, in the
course of which we want to renovate our society, upgrade it
quality-wise. Perestroika is proceeding in width and depth,
encompassing all public groups and all our territory. Perestroika
is growing and gaining momentum.
   As for glasnost, it and freedom of speech are, of course,
interconnected. However, these are not identical things. I would
put it this way: While freedom of speech is indispensable for
glasnost, we see glasnost as a broader phenomenon. For us it is not
just the right of every citizen to openly say what he or she thinks
about all social and political questions, but also the duty of the
ruling party and all bodies of authority and administration to
ensure openness in decision-making, be accountable for their
actions, act on criticism and consider advice and recommendations
from the shop floor, public organizations and individuals. ...
   Q: ... your dramatic decision to free Andrei Sakharov and ... to
ease the conditions of emigration for some Soviet Jews who desire
to live abroad have attracted attention around the world. ... What
further steps do you plan in this direction?
   A: Our perestroika, the main factor of which is creative effort,
also includes doing away with all deformations of the past years,
with everything that hampers manifestation of the humanitarian
essence of socialism.
   We know our problems and speak honestly and openly about them.
The process of democratization does not bypass the sphere of human
rights and liberties. We are enhancing the political and public
status of the human personality. Many issues have already been
resolved within the framework of the democratic process, while
others will be resolved as Soviet society changes qualitatively in
the course of perestroika. ...
   Once I said, and it seems to me, to an American: Please, show me
a country that has no problems. Each country has problems of its
own, human rights included. Of course, we are well-informed about
the situation with political, social, economic and other rights in
the United States. We know well the achievements and problems, but
also the flaws of American society. But we do not tolerate
interference in your home affairs, though we deem it right to
express our views on the processes taking place in American
society, on your administration's policy. But we do not want to
make all this a reason for confrontation. We consider such an
approach to be correct, fair, we see it as meeting the interests of
Soviet-American relations and their future. I want to emphasize
once again that we do not try to impose anything on the United
States, but at the same time we rebuff attempts by any side to
meddle in our affairs, no matter who tries to do so in your
country. ...
   We also welcome the accord on setting up a permanent body on
human rights with the participation of deputies to the U.S.S.R.
Supreme Soviet and U.S. congressmen. It is the duty of legislators
in both countries to show concern for observance of the citizens'
rights. ...
   For the sake of our mutual understanding, please, do not try to
teach us to live according to American rules _ it is altogether
useless. And I repeat that, for our part, we do not intend to
suggest our values to the Americans. Let each side live in its own
way, respecting each other's choice and voluntarily exchanging the
fruits of our labor in all spheres of human activity.
   I am sure that each nation, each people does not lose but,
conversely, wins if it looks at itself critically and does not
ignore others' experience, if it is open to understanding of and
respect for a different culture, a different way of thinking,
different customs, lastly, a different political system, of course,
if it is not terrorist, fascist or dictatorial.

<HEAD>Former Philippine Rebel Barred From Travel To U.S. Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The former head of the Philippine communist rebel
army says he was denied entry into the United States for a weekend
seminar, despite an invitation from a congressman and assurances
from Philippine government officials that he is not a threat.
   ``Some absurd perceptions of some influential quarters in the
Reagan administration about Philippine problems prevented me'' from
attending, said the former rebel, Bernabe Buscayno.
   He spoke by telephone from Manila to the Philippine-American
group that had scheduled him as its featured speaker at a
Washington seminar on the Philippines, which ended Sunday night.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Manila, Jerry Huchel, said Sunday
that Buscayno was turned down for an immediate visa because of
``the unusual nature of his case,'' but he said the application was
referred to the State Department for a possible waiver. The State
Department has no official spokesman available on weekends.
   Buscayno, who is still widely known among Filipinos by his rebel
name, ``Commander Dante,'' was jailed by ex-President Ferdinand E.
Marcos but set free when President Corazon Aquino came to power in
February 1986. In the late 1960s, he founded and led the New
People's Army which officials estimate now has up to 25,000 rebels
fighting the Aquino government.
   Buscayno has not renounced communism, but a Philippine Embassy
official in Washington said he carries a valid Philippine passport
and is no longer considered a rebel or a terrorist. Buscayno was an
unsuccessful candidate for the Philippine Senate last year.
   The Philippine official, who asked not to be identified, said
top embassy representatives informally told U.S. officials they saw
no reason why Buscayno could not travel to the United States.
   Huchel said the U.S. Embassy in Manila was aware that Buscayno
also had an invitation to visit the United States from Rep. Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., and that he had been scheduled to speak Saturday
at the national conference of the Campaign for Democracy and
Independence.
   The organization, known as CAMDI, includes U.S. groups that
opposed ex-President Ferdinand E. Marcos and originally supported
President Corazon Aquino but have become increasingly critical of
her 2-year-old government.
   Buscayno, in a statement translated for the group from Tagalog,
said he applied for a visa April 27 and was interviewed on May 2
for three hours by Manila embassy vice-consul Lois Matteson. He
said Ms. Matteson asked him if he might have reason to seek asylum
in the United States, since he survived an assassination attempt
last June.
   ``Rest assured, ma'am,'' Buscayno said he replied. ``I am still
rooted in Philippine soil and would not stay a day longer than
necessary.''
   He added: ``She was not convinced. She thought perhaps that I
would mistake the New York skyscrapers for the sugar cane fields of
my central Luzon hometown enough for me to launch a guerrilla
warfare in the metropolitan jungle of the biggest city in the world
to encircle Washington.''
   The U.S. Embassy spokesman in Manila confirmed that Ms. Matteson
interviewed Buscayno but said he could not discuss details of the
visa interview.
   Another speaker at the CAMDI seminar, University of the
Philippines regent Francisco Nemenzo, said he also had trouble
entering the United States last month.
   Nemenzo, who was also jailed for a time under Marcos and has
been critical of Aquino, said his visa was held up until the final
day of another U.S. seminar he was to attend last month. Nemenzo
was affiliated with a now nearly defunct Soviet-allied Philippine
communist party until the early 1970s, when he resigned.
   He said his past connections gave him trouble even though his
last visit to the United States in 1979 was sponsored by the State
Department.

<HEAD>Israel Using Computers To Suppress Palestinian Uprising</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is using computers as
a weapon in the struggle to suppress the Palestinian uprising in
the occupied lands.
   A computer linkup of the military administration, the police and
the civil and security service offices allows Israel to monitor
almost every aspect of life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arab merchants who obey the calls of the uprising's underground
leaders and refuse to pay taxes are often nabbed in a network of
computerized roadblocks.
   On the road between Jerusalem and the West Bank town of
Bethlehem, an AP reporter saw checkpoints where portable computers
were used to track down tax evaders. Names are taken from identity
cards Arabs are required to carry. When the names are entered in
the computer, it identifies those who owe taxes.
   The military government demands tax payment in exchange for a
registration of a newborn child or marriage, Palestinians told The
Associated Press.
   ``We are scared. The tax officials catch you and seize your car
or impose a huge fine,'' said Fahim, a wholesaler in Ramallah who
gave only his first name.
   A military government official said about 400 vehicles belonging
to delinquent Arab taxpayers have been seized in the West Bank.
   The computer ``is indeed the ultimate instrument of population
control, a carrot-and-stick operation,'' researcher Meron
Benvenisti wrote in his annual study of the occupied territories.
   Benvenisti said Israel started to develop a computerized
occupied lands data bank in August 1985. The five-year,
$8.5-million project was undertaken by TIM, an Israeli
representative of the U.S. computer company Data General.
   The aim was to computerize all information pertaining to the
population: ``property, real estate, family ties, political
attitudes, involvement in illegal activities, licensing,
occupations,'' he wrote in the 1987 West Bank Data Project, a study
financed by the U.S. Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.
   Some of the military government's departments, such as those of
interior and transport, are almost totally computerized today,
providing immediate access to personal and vehicle usage data, a
senior Israeli official said.
   Military authorities also can gain access to the main police
computer, linked to all the relevant ministries and principal
police stations, according to spokeswoman Ruth Schlezinger.
   She said by using special passwords, a police official can call
up such `subcategories'' as personal data, criminal records or
traffic violations.
   The data base was used on a wide scale this month in the Gaza
Strip, where the army started to exchange 400,000 Palestinians'
identity cards for new ones.
   At a military office set up at a school in Gaza City's Rimal
neighborhood, an AP reporter saw a computer center with 23 portable
IBM computers.
   Military sources said the computer marked with a star the names
of those wanted for security offenses and a special code appeared
next to the names of those who owed taxes.
   Some cards also were stamped with a warning: ``The bearer of
this card is not allowed to travel to Israel.'' That identifies the
residents as ``troublemakers'' in Israel's view and confines them
to the Gaza Strip.
   The Palestinians have fought back. United Nations Relief and
Works Agency spokesman Bill Lee and Arab reporters said
Palestinians this week burned a telephone junction box believed to
serve army computers.
   But military officials said Israel is not giving up on
computers. The army, in fact, is moving ahead with plans to
computerize the prison system, which has been swamped by the flood
of 6,000 people detained in the uprising.

<HEAD>Dispute Could Leave State Party With Two Delegations To Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute at Georgia's Republican convention
could leave the state with two competing delegations to the GOP's
national convention in New Orleans this summer.
   Atlanta lawyer Matt Patton took the podium at the convention
this weekend after an angry walkout by GOP Chairman John Stuckey,
who adjourned the meeting and left along with several hundred party
regulars.
   The more than 900 Republicans who remained elected Patton to
preside and continued the convention on their own, adopting a party
platform and electing 18 at-large delegates to the National
Republican Convention.
   Stuckey said he would convene a meeting of the party's state
executive committee to select the official at-large delegates,
leaving open the possibility of two Georgia delegations. Thirty
other GOP delegates were already picked at district conventions.
   Stuckey had presided Friday over an abbreviated session marked
by chanting and booing by many of the 968 delegates _ mostly Pat
Robertson supporters and newcomers to party politics _ who had been
disqualified by the party regulars' credentials committee.
   The credentials committee, complying with a court order,
considered and granted appeals by many of the disqualified
delegates Friday evening and, on Saturday, party officials began
the lengthy process of registering the official delegates.
   But Stuckey adjourned the convention, saying it had been taken
over by what he described as an unruly mob. He told reporters the
court rulings would be appealed to the state's highest court and,
if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Cuomo Predicts a Dukakis Landslide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says Democrat
Michael Dukakis would win the November presidential election by ``a
landslide'' and Vice President George Bush might even bow out of
the race.
   ``It's totally improbable,'' said Cuomo of a possible withdrawal
by Bush before the Republican convention in August, ``but I
wouldn't rule it out.''
   ``He (Bush) looks so weak anything could happen,'' said Cuomo.
   Cuomo, referring to national polls and continuing political
problems for the vice president, said, ``If I were Bush I'd be
concerned.''
   On the other hand, the New York governor said he was impressed
by Dukakis' ``superb campaign.''
   ``It's not going to be a victory. It's going to be a
landslide,'' Cuomo said.
   Even while talking about a possible major victory for Dukakis,
Cuomo continued to hold off any formal endorsement of the
Massachusetts governor. Cuomo has said he will make his endorsement
after the primaries end on June 7, and that his endorsement will go
to the front-runner at that point.

   Republican George Bush holds a
double-digit lead over Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis in South Carolina, according to a newspaper poll.
   Vice President Bush, who swept South Carolina in the Republican
primary in March, had the support of approximately 53 percent of
the registered voters in the poll published on Sunday by The
Columbia, S.C. State.
   Dukakis was favored by 41 percent of the people who were given a
choice between the two men. Others said they didn't like either
candidate or hadn't made up their minds.
   ``In the last year we've seen the Republican Party having the
support of both the Republicans and the Independents in South
Carolina, and that hasn't changed,'' said pollster Emerson Smith.
``Bush has a majority, and it's that old situation with the leader
_ he's going to have to do something pretty bad to lose that
support between now and November.''
   Smith is president of Metromark Market Research Inc. of
Columbia, which conducted the poll of 512 registered voters May
16-18 for The State. It has an error margin of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

   A retired policeman who assassinated a
federal judge and then committed suicide was seeking revenge
because the jurist last week dismissed a $2.5 million lawsuit filed
by the man's daughter, authorities say.
   Charles L. Koster, 67, left a suicide note at his Bath, Pa.,
mobile home saying he was acting alone after he was notified of
U.S. District Judge Richard J. Daronco's decision in the sexual
harassment case, said the FBI's James C. Esposito.
   ``The Koster family was totally consumed with this case and it
had become a crusade in their lives,'' Esposito said Sunday.
   Koster's wife said her husband killed the judge ``out of love''
for his daughter, Carolee.
   On Saturday, Daronco was gardening when Koster burst through a
hedge and opened fire with a .38-caliber revolver, striking the
judge several times, Esposito said.
   It was only the second time this century a federal judge was
assassinated. On May 29, 1979, Judge John Wood was shot by a sniper
outside his San Antonio, Texas, home.
   Daronco staggered toward the kitchen door 8 to 10 feet away.
   ``I need help! I need help!'' he shouted, according to a
neighbor who heard but did not see the attack, The New York Times
reported today.
   The 56-year-old judge ran into his study, closed the door and
barricaded himself as the gunman followed, Esposito said. Daronco
collapsed and died in the study.
   ``When he was satisfied the judge was dead, he turned the gun on
himself,'' said Esposito, adding that Koster was found in the foyer
a few feet away with the revolver in his hand.
   Esposito said Koster's 38-year-old daughter filed the lawsuit in
1981 against Chase Manhattan Bank and her boss, Allan Ross.
   She rejected a large settlement offered by the bank before the
trial began March 23, the Times reported.
   Koster, who retired from the New York City Police Department in
1969 after 20 years and was a security guard from 1971 to 1981 at
the bank where his daughter worked, spent much of his life savings
on the case, Esposito said.
   ``Mr. Koster was present many of the days that this matter was
being heard before the judge and there was at least one
confrontation that occurred in the courtroom during the course of
the trial,'' Esposito said.
   In an interview Sunday night with The (Allentown, Pa.) Morning
Call, Koster's wife, Mary, portrayed him as a kind, well-liked
family man who was driven to violence by the lawsuit.
   ``It was eating away at him that Chase did what they did to
her,'' she said. ``Carolee was trying to get her life going. He did
it out of love for her.''
   Koster's daughter said she had been fired in 1980 from her
$28,000 a year job as vice president in the personnel department
after earning five promotions.
   ``It was like night and day after I ended the relationship,''
she said, according to today's New York Daily News.
   The judge rejected her argument that she was denied a transfer
out of the personnel department because a relationship she had had
with Ross was over.
   ``Plaintiff's allegation that defendant Ross, in retaliation for
the termination of their sexual relationship, caused her to be
denied a transfer to the real-estate finance department is not
substantiated by the evidence,'' Daronco wrote, according to the
Times.
   In dismissing all of Ms. Koster's claims against the bank and
Ross, the judge also ruled that she was ``responsible for her own
termination'' of employment at the Chase bank because she
``overstated her experience and potential, refused to accept
management's contrary assessment and declined the only position at
the time for which she was qualified,'' the Times said.
   Ms. Koster said her father believed the judge was biased against
her, according to today's New York Post.
   ``I still love my father,'' she said. ``I'm sorry about what
happened, but I believe he thought he was doing something out of
love, too.''

<HEAD>Reformer Replaces Aging Party Chief In Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The selection of Premier Karoly Grosz
as the head of the Communist Party is a victory for reform and a
clear shift from the staunch ideology of Janos Kadar, whose 32-year
grip on power had become an obstacle to progress, party officials
said.
   Grosz replaced Kadar as general secretary on Sunday night in a
sweeping reshuffle of party leadership that favored the reformists,
who now will get their chance to solve Hungary's deepening economic
crisis. A Politburo member said Kadar had had asked not to be
nominated for the party leadership.
   ``There was no real reform possible as long as (Kadar) was in
power,'' said a prominent party member who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Kadar, who turns 76 Thursday, was named to the newly created
honorary post of party president at the end of a three-day party
conference in which delegates assailed the veteran leader in a
manner unprecedented in the Soviet bloc.
   ``This conference marks a radical change,'' Grosz told Hungarian
television minutes after being named new general secretary of the
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.
   Grosz, 57, is viewed as a leader in the mold of Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Grosz has gained a reputation as a pragmatist
willing to face unpleasant truths about Hungary's economic
stagnation.
   ``Mr. Grosz's greatest merit is that he has not been afraid to
make decisions that are highly unpopular,'' said Sandor Demjan,
president and general manager of the Hungarian Credit Bank.
   ``I think he will personify responsibility and push for the
removal of those who are incompetent and who have thwarted
reforms,'' Demjan said.
   Reformers were clearly on the offensive throughout the
conference.
   In debates that were often lively and critical, delegates
relentlessly assailed Kadar and called openly for new faces and new
policies.
   Leading reformists in the party have argued openly for months
that economic recovery would fail without political change.
Inflation in Hungary reached 18.5 percent in the first quarter of
this year, and its gross foreign debt is $18 billion, the highest
per-capita foreign debt in Eastern Europe.
   Several of the most vocal advocates for change advanced to key
policy- making roles.
   Grosz becomes party leader of a revamped Politburo trimmed of
aging bureaucrats and stacked with reformers. In the sweeping
overhaul, the Politburo shrank to 11 members from the previous 13.
   Eight old members of the Politburo were dropped in the
reshuffle. A new 108-member Central Committee replaced the former
106-member body, with about one-third of old members failing to
gain re-election to the new body.
   In a stunning comeback, Reszo Nyers, who fathered Hungary's
pioneering economic policies in the 1960s was re-elected to the
Politburo. He was ousted from the ruling body in 1973. Another
leading reform advocate, Imre Pozsgay, also advanced to the ruling
body.
   Pozsgay, leader of the communist-sponsored Patriotic People's
Front, has been a vocal supporter of efforts to allow Hungarians
more of a voice in shaping economic and political affairs.
   Kadar was dropped from the new Politburo. But the standing
ovation he received when word of his appointment as president was
announced signaled he still enjoys affection and respect among many
party members.
   ``This is an exceptional day for Hungary,'' said a prominent
party official who supports reform. ``Kadar was a great leader but
was clearly no longer competent to hold power.''
   Politburo member Janos Berecz told a news conference that Kadar
asked not to be nominated for the party leadership, citing his age
and what Berecz termed ``the need for renewal.'' Berecz said Grosz
nominated Kadar as party president but that the veteran's leader
exact duties are not yet clear.
   The move was made ``to give respect and appreciation to a man
who, for more than 30 years, has been linked to all of our results
and achievements,'' Berecz said. Kadar is the first East bloc
leader to relinquish power after such an open debate of the merits
of his leadership.
   His replacement leaves Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov, in power since
1954, as the only Soviet bloc leader from the 1950s still in office.
   Since becoming premier in June, Grosz has earned a reputation as
a pragmatist and apparently toned down earlier hard-line views,
offering any Hungarian not opposed to communism and alliance with
Moscow a part in political debate.
   Kadar took over the party leadership in 1956 after Moscow
brought in troops and tanks to quash an anti-Soviet revolt. He
gradually won popularity at home and abroad for encouraging reforms
that brought Hungarian consumers one of the highest standards of
living in the East bloc.
   But Kadar came under increasing attack in the last two years
when he was seen as an obstacle to needed political and economic
change.

<HEAD>Golden Temple Opens For Public Worship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEEPAK SHARMA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 600 Sikhs filed solemnly into
the Golden Temple today as it was opened to the public for the
first time in two weeks.
   The temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, was closed during a police
siege May 9-18 that drove Sikh extremists from their temple hiding
place. The separatists, who have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland since 1982, had turned the Golden Temple into
an armed camp.
   At least 46 people, mostly Sikh militants, were killed during
the siege. Three militants committed suicide by taking cyanide
capsules rather than surrender to police. No police or paramilitary
forces were killed.
   Services in the inner sanctum of the temple, suspended on the
second day of the siege, were resumed by priests on Sunday after
volunteers washed the floor of the temple with milk to cleanse it.
   Police searched all 627 devotees today for weapons at an
Amritsar police station, then moved them in four city buses to the
temple for worship.
   Police and paramilitary troops retain a cordon around the shrine
and enforce a curfew within 300 yards of its walls.
   The cordon is likely to stay in place until the government
reaches an agreement with the Sikh Temple Management Committee,
which has so far refused its request to enforce a ban on militants
re-entering the shrine.
   One death was reported in Punjab on Sunday night.
   The United News of India said a goldsmith was shot to death by
Sikh gunmen in the village of Murh near the state capital at
Chandigarh.
   Earlier Sunday, nine deaths were reported, including four Hindus
killed in a bomb blast at a railway station in the town of
Ludhiana, 80 miles southeast of Amritsar. Indian newspapers today
said the bombing appeared to be the fourth attack aimed at Hindu
migrant workers, who are in Punjab to help with the planting.
Punjab is India's most productive agricultural state.
   The latest slayings raised to more than 1,150 the number of
people killed by Sikh extremists in Punjab since the start of the
year. In all of 1987, 1,030 people were killed. Most of the victims
have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed to the separatist cause.
   Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by India's majority
Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million
people but are a majority in Punjab.

   Saying ``what's passed has passed,''
defrocked evangelist Jimmy Swaggart ended his three-month exile
from the pulpit but conceded that not everyone will forgive him for
his sins with a prostitute.
   ``I am sure there will be many ... that will see to it that I
don't forget. I realize it will be the hardest task,'' Swaggart
said Sunday.
   In his first sermon since tearfully confessing on Feb. 21 to
unspecified sins, the television evangelist reclaimed his pulpit
with fire-and-brimstone fervor before 5,000 followers.
   ``Once you look up into his (God's) face, you will never be any
cleaner than you are right now,'' Swaggart said.
   ``I want to serve notice on the whole world: What's passed has
passed.
   ``Even looking back is not fit. I am reaching forward for those
things that are before. I am serving notice on demons and devils
and hell _ the best is yet to come!'' he shouted.
   His initial appearance at the pulpit drew a polite response, but
as he preached, the congregation became more enthusiastic and gave
him several loud, standing ovations.
   Swaggart, stripped of his credentials as an Assemblies of God
minister, returned after a three-month suspension originally
ordered by an Assemblies' state council.
   National leaders of the Pentecostal denomination defrocked him
in April after he refused to accept a sterner banishment of at
least one year from the pulpit for a reported encounter with a
prostitute, Debra Murphree, who says Swaggart paid her to pose nude
for him at a New Orleans motel.
   Marvin Gorman, a defrocked minister who claims in a lawsuit that
Swaggart ruined his ministry by spreading false stories about
adulterous affairs, reportedly hired private detectives to
photograph Swaggart outside the motel.
   After a Sunday service at his Metropolitan Christian Center in
suburban New Orleans, Gorman said Swaggart needs to fast and pray.
   ``I would hope he is already doing that, but if he hasn't, there
will be no way he can make it through the battles not only he has
faced, but he will be facing in the future,'' Gorman said.
   A group of former Swaggart followers, meanwhile, gathered in a
Baton Rouge hotel ballroom for the service of Cross Fire Assembly,
an Assemblies of God church formed by ministers who recently left
Swaggart's ministry.
   Worshiper Ed Paradela said Swaggart's departure from the
denomination led him to change churches.
   `If Swaggart would have really repented, he would have really
been obedient to the Assemblies of God,'' he said.
   Swaggart told congregants at his Family Worship Center that he
still carried the word of God.
   ``God called me as a child. I love him more than life itself. He
is my life ... You might want to say that call is abrogated. But I
know better.''
   Swaggart did not talk about the specifics of his sin, referring
to the revelation and the problems that beset the ministry
afterward as ``this thing.''
   ``This ministry is in God's hands,'' he said. ``If he sees fit
for me to sweep floors ... at a little mission across the tracks, I
would be honored to do so for the rest of my life.''
   Swaggart said that only God could heal a sinner and overcome the
guilt that follows sin.
   ``Guilt is one of Satan's greatest weapons ... Psychiatry
doesn't have an answer for it, psychology doesn't have an answer
for it. Therapy does not have an answer for it,'' he said.
   ``The blood of Jesus Christ is not a treatment. It is a cure,''
Swaggart shouted as he pounded on a large speaker on the podium.
   Before ushers passed the offering plate, Swaggart referred to
reports that his worldwide ministry is in financial trouble.
Swaggart recently appealed for $6 million, and three major cable
television networks have canceled his programs.
   ``For every dollar we get, we spend a dollar and a dime and we
spend it before we get it because the world needs to hear the
gospel of Jesus Christ,'' he said.

   The departure of Janos Kadar as Hungary's
Communist Party leader came during unprecedented open criticism of
his policies and offered proof of the Soviet bloc's new penchant
for orderly transfers of power.
   Kadar, who ran the party for 32 years, stepped down as general
secretary on Sunday at the end of a three-day conference at which
delegates openly called for new faces and new policies. He turns 76
on Thursday.
   They got their new party leader in Premier Karoly Grosz, a
57-year-old pragmatist who appears open to political reform. Kadar
was named to the largely ceremonial post of party president, a
position created for him.
   According to Politburo member Janos Berecz, Kadar asked
conference delegates who made sweeping changes in the party elite
not to nominate him as party leader, citing age and ``the need for
renewal.''
   Grosz, in turn, nominated Kadar for his new ceremonial post.
   The procedure suggested the change in power may have been agreed
upon in advance in an attempt to unite party ranks increasingly
split in recent months over the pace and shape of reform.
   In Czechoslovakia in December, outgoing party boss Gustav Husak
also reportedly nominated his successor, Milos Jakes. Jakes has
kept Husak in the Politburo and in the ceremonial state presidency.
   Both transfers occurred without the outward tumult that
surrounded Husak's promotion in 1969 to replace Alexander Dubcek
after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, or
Kadar's rise to power after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian
revolt of 1956.
   It is not clear how much of a role the Soviets played in either
of the recent transitions. Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
pledged not to interfere in the affairs of his Eastern European
allies, but his reforms undoubtedly increased pressure on both
Kadar and Husak.
   Kadar's departure leaves Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria, in power
since 1954, as the only Soviet bloc leader from the 1950s still in
office.
   Zhivkov and East Germany's Erich Honecker, who so far has
refused to follow Gorbachev's political and economic reforms, both
are 75 and likely will come under increased pressure to step down.
   They may be more willing to do so now that Kadar and Husak have
shown that it is possible to relinquish the top party post while
still remaining on the political scene, albeit with diminished
power.
   But it is unlikely that either will face such public criticism
as Kadar, who in the past two decades tolerated a degree of open
discussion rare in the Soviet bloc until Gorbachev took over the
Kremlin in March 1985.
   Hungary's relative openness was in full display at the three-day
conference, where several delegates voiced demands for radical
reform.
   They wound up sweeping from power many aging party officials,
including eight Politburo members. The changes leave Hungary with a
young and untried ruling body that contains two women, a novelty in
the Soviet bloc.
   The average age of the 11 new Politburo members is 52. Only
three men have been members since 1985, two were promoted in a
party reshuffle last June and six new members were added Sunday.
   Another Soviet bloc rarity was the promotion to the Politburo of
a former member of the body, Reszo Nyers. Dubbed the father of
Hungary's pioneering economic reforms in the 1960s, Nyers was
ousted from the Politburo in 1973 after apparently pushing too hard
for more changes.
   The promotion to the ruling body of Nyers and Imre Pozsgay, an
outspoken advocate of referendums on key issues and dialogue with
independent political groups, may be designed to muzzle their most
radical public statements.
   But it also signals Grosz' readiness to take reformists into the
top echelons of power, guaranteeing them input into a policy to
tackle Hungary's economic crisis and restore public confidence in
the party.

   Karoly Grosz, Hungary's new Communist
Party leader, has built a reputation as a canny, pragmatic
politician with a charisma not unlike that of his Soviet
counterpart, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Grosz, 57, succeeded Janos Kadar on Sunday as general secretary
during an overhaul of the party leadership.
   After becoming premier in June, Grosz established himself as a
politician willing to tackle unpleasant economic issues while
softening the blow of austerity measures with the promise of
political reform.
   He has moved around the country, chatting with workers and
apparently enjoying interviews with journalists from the state-run
media. During a visit last month to Britain, he proved to be an
unabashed admirer of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   These tactics overshadowed party ideologist Janos Berecz,
Grosz's main rival in the battle to become party chief, and Kadar
himself, who was left to shoulder the blame for Hungary's economic
crisis.
   Like Gorbachev, who is two years his junior, Grosz comes from an
impeccable background and got his start in politics during the
turbulent times of Josef Stalin's death in 1953.
   Official biographies say Grosz was born into a worker's family
in 1930 in the northeastern city of Miskolc.
   A Communist by 1945, Grosz followed his mother into work in a
print shop. By 1949, he was in Budapest with the national party
youth organization.
   Seizing a chance for promotion and education, Grosz entered the
country's Military Academy in the early 1950s, training as an
officer for the Hungarian army, whose upper ranks had fallen victim
to sweeping Stalinist purges.
   Within a year, Grosz was a deputy lieutenant. He then served as
full lieutenant stationed near the Yugoslav border who also was
charged with the political education of his battalion.
   In November 1954, Grosz was discharged from the army and sent to
Borsod County Party Committee in northern Hungary to observe party
organizations, factories and coal mines in his native Miskolc.
   Official accounts suggest Grosz spent the turbulent year of 1956
in Miskolc, removed from the turmoil in Budapest, where Kadar
emerged as undisputed leader after Soviet troops crushed an
anti-Stalinist revolt and arrested liberal leader Imre Nagy.
   By 1961, Grosz had moved up to the central apparatus of the
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party after a spell at the party
academy and was named party head at state-run radio and television.
   Between 1968 and 1973, Grosz was deputy head of the party's
Central Committee propaganda department, and from 1974 to 1979 was
in full charge of the official propaganda machine.
   He returned to Borsod as regional party head in 1979, and in
December 1984 advanced to head the influential Budapest party,
which contains almost one quarter of the nation's 800,000
communists.
   At the national party congress in March 1985, Grosz was elevated
to the ruling party Politburo.
   When Grosz was named premier, he almost immediately acknowledged
that some political reform was needed to complement stringent
economic measures he pushed to control mounting foreign debt.
   He pushed through the East bloc's first value-added and personal
income taxes, designed to deregulate price controls and tap the
income from the second jobs many Hungarians hold to make ends meet.
   Although his austerity program is to last until 1990, Grosz has
stressed there is no target date for overcoming Hungary's economic
crisis.
   Grosz has outlined vague plans for parliament to have a larger
and more supervisory role in government decision-making, and even
countenanced dialogue with unofficial opposition groups who do not
contest Communist rule.
   ``This government is not likely to go down in history as one of
the victorious,'' Grosz said last fall, ``but if we can succeed, we
will be praised for taking an interest in the country.''

<HEAD>Writers, Producers to Meet With Federal Mediator</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Meeting begins at 5 p.m. EDT; lede prospects unlikely</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scriptwriters' strike against movie and TV
producers entered its 12th week with potential for a break as a
federal mediator called both sides together for the first formal
talks in more than a month.
   The meeting between representatives of the Writers Guild of
America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
was set this afternoon.
   It was the third such effort and the first since a 20-minute
session April 18.
   Recent informal discussions between the sides came to nothing,
said Herb Steinberg, an Alliance spokesman.
   Both sides have suffered from the walkout, which began March 7
over issues of payments for reruns, works distributed in foreign
countries and creative control.
   The meeting was set only four days before guild members were
scheduled to vote on proposed contracts with up to 24 independent
producers. The vote could provide much-needed jobs for a
substantial number of writers, said guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   Leaders of the 9,000-member union have granted only two waivers
to independent producers but are recommending that West and East
Coast members ratify the independent contracts in hopes of
shortening the walkout, she said.
   ``It's showing that the proposals of the guild are reasonable
and that businesses feel they can conduct their business profitably
with those contracts,'' she said.
   But Steinberg said: ``They've been saying that for 12 weeks, and
we've been telling them their reasoning is unreasonable. ... There
can't be a settlement if they're coming and demanding more.''
   ``So far the only independents they've signed are none. Even the
independents find their deal too difficult to swallow,'' he said,
citing a decision by Johnny Carson of NBC's ``The Tonight Show'' to
broadcast shows despite the strike.
   On April 14, the union approved independent contracts with the
``New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and Ivan Reitman Productions,
which has produced such movies as ``Ghostbusters'' and ``Animal
House.''
   Although other independent contracts were considered, the guild
voted against approval at the time.
   Ms. Rhoden said more than 150 producers have asked to negotiate
with the guild for independent contracts.
   None of the independents who negotiated separate deals are among
the 200 represented by the alliance, Steinberg said.
   Steinberg said the signing of the independents would not affect
negotiations, because they represent less than 10 percent of
feature film and 15 percent of television production.
   Producers say the strike has cost the industry more than $15
million in lost jobs and production time, with about 1,400 clerical
workers, cast and crew members laid off due to the stop in scripts.

<HEAD>Stocks, Dollar Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped slightly
today in Tokyo and the dollar also fell after moving in a narrow
range in lackluster and trendless trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 144.09
points, or 0.52 percent, after recovering some of its morning
losses in the afternoon session. It closed the trading day at
27,249.76 points. The main market barometer had lost 248.79 points
by the end of the morning session.
   Nothing really affected the stock market, said Ron Napier, vice
president of the Japanese equities department at Salomon Brothers.
   ``The problem is Japan has to open all by itself Monday
mornings,'' Napier said. ``There's not really any market-moving
news.''
   He added that the ``stock market was very shaky in the U.S. last
week, which caused a general sell-off (in Tokyo).''
   Volume share in the first section of the TSE was 700 million
shares, down from its last Friday's 800-million-share total.
   In foreign exchange dealings, meanwhile, the dollar closed at
124.80 yen, down 0.02 yen from its last week close, but slightly
higher than its opening today at 124.78 yen.
   The currency fluctuated in a narrow range between 124.71 yen and
124.82 yen during the day.
   ``With no specific market-moving incentives at hand, the dollar
remains in a narrow range,'' said an exchange dealer at a major
commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He added that market participants were trying to keep the U.S.
currency at a low 124-yen level.
   `We're likely leading to a period where Japanese trade surpluses
will be higher again, and we're concerned about that,'' Napier said.
   ``Also the U.S. does seem to have inflation problems... On that
basis the yen should be higher than the dollar,'' he added.

<HEAD>Economic Plan Would Turn Japan's Strength Inward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic strategists today gave Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita a five-year plan urging that the Japanese economy
be directed at increasing domestic demand and reducing the
country's massive trade surplus.
   The plan, made public after six months of research at
Takeshita's behest, puts an official imprimatur on the recent shift
in Japan's economy, which achieved vibrant growth last year mostly
on a boom in domestic housing rather than the traditional method of
expanding exports.
   A summary of the plan for 1988 through 1992 said three major
economic problems ``can all be resolved by promoting and
consolidating the shift to a domestic-demand-led economy.''
   The problems, it said, were how to reduce Japan's trade surplus,
how to improve the quality of life for the 122 million Japanese and
how to promote ``balanced national economic and social
development.''
   If the plan's aims are attained, it should please Japan's
trading partners like the United States and Western Europe, who
have complained for years that the export-minded Japanese weren't
taking effective measures to reduce trade imbalances.
   Takeshita asked the Economic Council, a task force reporting to
the prime minister, to produce a five-year plan last November
shortly after he succeeded Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   The chairman of the council, Gaishi Hiraiwa, who is chairman of
Tokyo Electric Power Co., told reporters in a briefing that Japan's
previous 10 economic plans since 1955 had aimed at quantitative
expansion, but the new plan envisions the transformation of
economic structure and tries to attain ``qualitative enhancement.''
   Attaining the goals will mean ``pain and burden to the people at
large,'' he said. ``Therefore, I believe that the understanding and
cooperation of the Japanese people are needed more than ever.''
   The plan will be debated by Takeshita's Cabinet in coming weeks
and its general outlines are expected to guide Japan's economic
development.
   The plan's directions are similar to those in a 1986 economic
report requested by Nakasone. The Maekawa Report, compiled by a
panel headed by former Bank of Japan Gov. Haruo Maekawa, also
recommended a shift away from export industries to domestic demand
_ the direction the economy has taken _ but didn't achieve the
status of a report approved by the Cabinet.
   The new plan predicts real economic growth averaging 3.75
percent annually over the five years. Domestic demand would provide
a 4.25-percent average growth rate, it said, while exports would
provide negative growth of a half-percent annually.
   It offers no target for Japan's surpluses of trade and payments,
saying instead they should reach ``internationally harmonious
levels during the period of the plan.''
   In the fiscal year ended March 31, Japan's trade surplus dropped
for the first time in eight years, from $89.7 billion in 1986-87 to
$76 billion in 1987-88, according to government statistics.
   The high value of the yen, which has doubled against the dollar
in the past three years, has increased the Japanese appetite for
foreign goods while making Japanese exports more costly in overseas
markets.
   Last year, for instance, Japanese automakers fell slightly short
of their government-set quota of 2.3 million cars exported to the
United States because Japanese cars are no longer so much of a
bargain for U.S. buyers.
   The plan urges the introduction of the five-day, 40-hour
workweek _ now many Japanese work six days a week.
   For foreign countries, the new economic plan offers the
following directions:
   _Improving access to the Japanese market so that Japan is ``a
land of business opportunity for the world at large.''
   _``Contributing to a better world'' through trade and investment
and by increasing foreign aid and capital-recycling to developing
countries.
   _Contributing to stabilization of the international currency
markets by cooperating with other leading industrial countries on
economic policy.

   A 2,000-pound great white shark caught off of
San Clemente Island drew lots of nibbles but no bites until a
collector hooked it for $600, a fish seller said.
   A weeklong crowd of gawkers, restaurant owners and taxidermists
paraded through the freezer of Galletti Brothers Seafoods on
Terminal Island, giving manager Dino Lauro headaches but no sales.
   ``It's time to get rid of that thing,'' he said. ``I'm tired of
answering phones. It's taking away from my regular business.''
   A collector who wanted the jaws finally bought it on Thursday,
said Lauro.
   The fish broker said he initially had hoped to get $1,500 for
the shark because of publicity surrounding its May 13th capture
about 20 miles south of San Clemente Island.
   Lauro said he could not sell the meat because the fish had been
dead too long to cut into steaks, and anyway, many people refuse to
eat great whites.
   The Aggressor, a San Pedro fishing boat owned by Anthony Tipich,
snared the shark in gill nets a few days after a great white
spotted in shallow water off Newport Beach prompted authorities to
close beaches.

   A 22-year-old man was shot to death in a
confrontation with rival gang members as he walked down a street,
authorities said.
   After Theron Shakir was approached by two young men Sunday
evening, words were exchanged and one of them pulled a gun and shot
Shakir twice in the chest, said sheriff's Deputy Hal Grant.
   The suspects fled and Shakir, believed to be a gang member, was
dead on arrival at a hospital, officials said.
   No arrests had been made, Grant said.
   More than 120 people have been killed in gang-related violence
in Los Angeles County this year. The city Police Department has
responded to the increasing gang problem by conducting dragnets
that has resulted in more than 1,400 arrests.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca says Ronald
Reagan is the kind of guy who's fun to hang out with but has no
business being in the White House.
   ``In life there are some people you meet whom you'd just like to
pal around with. They're fun, they put you in a good frame of mind,
and they make you feel terrific,'' the 63-year-old Iacocca writes
in his new book ``Talking Straight.''
   ``Well, that's Ronald Reagan,'' Iacocca said. ``He's not Dr.
Strangelove _ He's Dr. Feelgood. I want him to be my pal. But not
my president.''
   Excerpts of the book, due out in June, appear in this week's
People magazine. Iacocca's previous book, ``Iacocca,'' sold 2.6
million copies.
   In his new book, Iacocca writes about the 1983 death of his wife
of 27 years, Mary; his short-lived second marriage with the former
Peggy Johnson; his more than $20 million dollar salary in 1986; his
struggles with Don Regan while the latter was secretary of the
treasury; and his predictions for the 1988 presidential race.
   Iacocca, who had been mentioned as a possible Democratic
presidential nominee, admits he thought of running, but decided
against it. ``I have no desire to switch professions at this stage
of my life,'' he wrote.
   So who does Iacocca expect to be in the White House next January?
   ``The odds are overpowering that we're going to have a very
activist Democratic president. I don't think the Republicans can
make it.''

<HEAD>New Wave Of Rioting Breaks Out In Kwangju</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of protesters hurled
firebombs, battled riot squads and stormed three police stations in
the southern city of Kwangju today in the latest wave of
anti-government unrest, police said.
   Students shouting ``Down with the military'' and ``Drive out the
Yankees'' smashed windows and doors of the stations in the city
before they were driven off by poice, authorities said.
   About 3,000 protesters later battled police near Chonnam
University after trying to march off campus.
   Students surged out of the university gates and pelted police
with rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazing
gasoline. Police in riot gear drove them back with tear gas.
   Police said 23 protesters had been arrested, but declined to say
whether there were injuries.
   The clashes came as radical groups continued to press for a full
investigation into the army's bloody suppression of a 1980 revolt
in Kwangju in which at least 191 people were killed.
   Radicals have clashed with police for six straight days in
Kwangju, 165 miles south of Seoul. Hundreds of students from
colleges across the nation have poured into the city in recent days
to take part in protests.
   Other parts of South Korea were reported quiet today, a national
holiday marking the birth of Buddha.
   On Sunday, 1,200 students hurled rocks at police near Chonnam
University. Police in riot gear fired tear gas to drive the
protesters back into the school.
   National police remained on nationwide alert against renewed
protests. Riot police squadrons guarded key government buildings in
Seoul and other major cities.
   A series of demonstrations last week were the worst political
unrest since nationwide anti-government violence last summer forced
the government to agree to presidential elections and broad reforms.
   Radical students and dissidents took to the streets on the May
18 anniversary of the Kwangju uprising and called for the overthrow
of President Roh Tae-woo's government.
   Protesters contend that Roh, a top general in 1980, played a key
role in suppressing the revolt. They demand that he be investigated
and punished.
   Roh won the presidency in December without receiving a majority
of the vote after two opposition candidates split the
anti-government balloting.
   The new government has introduced broad democratic reforms, but
radical groups remain determined to oust the administration.
   The demostrations have been strongly anti-American, with radical
students claiming the United States keeps the Roh government in
power. Protesters called for the removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Police officials in Seoul today said that seven students who
attacked the U.S. Embassy with bombs Friday had been formally
charged with assault and illegally demonstrating. A police officer
and two students were hurt in the incident, but there was no damage
to the embassy.
   The officials, who declined to be identified, said they were
hunting for two other students believed to have masterminded the
attack.

   Some of America's future chemists and
physicists applied scientific principles to solving puzzles that
included dropping raw eggs and slowing the ascent of balloons.
   About 1,200 junior and senior high school students from 36
states, who had already competed in local, state and regional
contests, met here Saturday for the fourth annual National Science
Olympiad. Junior high students competed in 22 events and high
school students entered 23 events.
   The competition was sponsored by the Army Reserve Officer
Training Corps.
   ``This Science Olympiad is the first thing I've seen in the last
18 years that has stimulated the minds of these students,'' said
Charles Goslein, an assiciate dean of instruction at Penn Valley
Community College in Kansas City, Mo., who presided at the balloon
race.
   Two Georgia teen-agers used motor oil, dough and foam to cushion
the landing of a raw egg dropped 25 feet to win the Naked Egg Drop.
   Laura Turner and Caroline McCoy, both 16 and from Tift County
(Ga.) High School, said the key was the motor oil blended into the
half-inch thick cushion.
   In the competition, medium-size raw eggs were dropped from great
heights and caught with cushion containers designed to keep the
shells intact. Cushion materials included marshmallow, peanut
butter, Jell-O, raspberry jam, wet towels, axle grease, noodles on
cotton, and soggy whole white bread on plastic foam.
   ``The problem wasn't really keeping it from cracking but keeping
it from bouncing off,'' said Ms. Turner. ``The motor oil ... made
it stick. It just sat there in the motor oil.''
   In the balloon race, students dreamed up ways of slowing the
ascent of balloons from the floor to a ceiling finish-line.
   Debra Martinsen, a senior at Toledo High School near Olympia,
Wash., and schoolmate Hungman Chan, a junior, designed an
accordion-shaped construction-paper anchor for their balloon.
   ``First you find the area of density of a piece of paper and
then you find the buoyant force of the balloon,'' said Ms.
Martinsen, who sat at a table in front of a scale, ``and then with
math you find out how much paper you need to counteract the buoyant
force of the balloon.''
   Ms. Martinsen had flown to the competition from Gainesville,
Fla., where she participated in a three-day National Humanities and
Science Symposium. She was worried the two events would make her
fall behind at school.
   ``When I get back I have five days to catch up on everything and
then graduate,'' she said.
   Not all the events were strictly scientific.
   Eighth-grader Adrienne Crosier of the Caesar Rodney Junior High
School in Camden, Del., fashioned a bass fiddle from a potato chip
can, broomstick handle and venetian blind cord for a competition
called the Sound of Music. All contestants were required to play
``America the Beautiful'' on instruments from nonmusical objects.
   At the end, they formed their own orchestra.
   In addition to winners in the individual events, the school with
the highest point total captured the division. Haverford (Pa.) High
School won the senior division, while Campus Junior High School in
Irmo, S.C., captured the junior division title.

   A team of horses pulling a stagecoach
bolted and ran out of control for almost a quarter mile before the
coach slammed into a telephone pole, injuring eight tourists,
authorities said.
   One woman was in serious condition at Healdsburg General
Hospital after Sunday's accident; the others were treated for minor
injuries and released, authorities said.
   The coach was part of a vineyard tour in Sonoma County, said
California Highway Patrol officer Tom Hunter.
   Tour guide Richard Dilworth was in a vineyard explaining grape
growing when he started to get back in the coach.
   It was then the horses bolted. Dilworth grabbed the reins but
the wheels rolled over them and broke them.
   The horses veered off the road and headed straight for the pole.
Hunter said half the team went to the left of the pole, the other
to the right and the stagecoach rammed it.
   Gretchen Urban of Chicago was the most seriously injured.

<TEXT>
   The 4,700 Firestone Inc. workers were
returning to work in six states today after company and union
negotiators reached a tentative agreement that ended a week-old
strike.
   Meanwhile, a contract covering 15,000 Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
workers was ratified Sunday when a local in Akron approved the
agreement, United Rubber Workers union officials said.
   A tentative agreement was reached Tuesday, and nine of 11
Goodyear locals have approved the contract. One local rejected it
and workers in Gadsen, Ala., vote today, union spokesman Curt Brown
said.
   Union officials were optimistic about the Firestone agreement
reached early Sunday, but some workers remained suspicious as they
beagn returning to work night.
   ``There are a lot of people uneasy about it, going back to the
plant and building up (an inventory of) tires without knowing
what's going to happen in a couple of weeks,'' said union member
Dan Hook in Des Moines, Iowa.
   The URW struck Firestone May 15 after the company refused to
accept the cost-of-living allowance provided in an industry pattern
agreement the union negotiated with Goodyear.
   The three-year Firestone contract followed the revised Goodyear
pattern, Brown said.
   George W. Aucott, who heads Firestone's tire operations, called
the agreement ``fair and realistic,'' and added that it
``recognizes the particular needs of Firestone's tire operation.''
   The Firestone agreement would:
   _Maintain cost-of-living allowances in each year, with a 1-cent
increase for every increase of 26-hundredths of a point in the
Consumer Price Index.
   _Boost wages 25 cents per hour by deducting that amount from
future cost-of-living adjustments in increments of 10 cents, 10
cents, and 5 cents.
   _Increase retirement pensions for current workers by $3.50 to
$23.50 per month for each year of service. In addition, current
retirees would receive a lump sum bonus of $200 before Dec. 1.
   The pact also assures continuation of the contract if a
Firestone plant is sold to another company during the next three
years, and contains a no-strike wage reopener clause in the third
year.
   Ratification votes on the Firestone pact should be held this
week at company offices and plants in Akron; Noblesville, Ind., Des
Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Russellville, Ark.; and Oklahoma City,
Brown said.
   The Des Moines, Decatur and Oklahoma City plants make tires; the
Noblesville plant makes molded rubber products, and the
Russellville plant makes innertubes.

<HEAD>66 Women Vie For Miss Universe Title In Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-six women will vie for the Miss
Universe crown Tuesday at a suburban sports stadium in a glittery
program brought to Taiwan after the government lifted a 23-year-old
ban on beauty contests.
   The 37th-annual Miss Universe pageant was scheduled for 9 a.m.
(9 p.m. EDT Monday) so it can be broadcast live in the United
States.
   Consequently, the audience in Taipei will be forced to wear
tuxedos and evening gowns at a time more appropriate for breakfast.
   Contestants include Miss USA Courtney Gibbs of Forth Worth,
Texas, and Miss Republic of China Jade Hu, who represents Taiwan.
   Organizers estimated 600 million people in 57 countries would
watch the program on television to see who would succeed 1987 Miss
Universe Cecilia Bolocco of Chile, and win more than $250,000 in
cash and prizes.
   About 20 percent of 9,000 seats at Linkou Stadium remained
unsold as of Monday afternoon, local pageant organizers said.
   Beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by Taiwan government leaders
who viewed the contests as an extravagance for a poor, developing
nation. They also were dismayed by reports that a Miss China winner
performed strip dances in Las Vegas.
   Taiwan is now a prosperous, newly industrialized country and
authorities in October 1987 lifted the ban to clear the way for a
domestic airline to sponsor the Miss Universe pageant despite
lingering opposition from a few groups.
   Feminists have demonstrated against the lifting of the ban while
some retired soldiers angrily denounce the pageants as a waste of
money and an insult to mothers.
   The telecast generally is viewed in Taiwan as a rare opportunity
to present the island to a worldwide audience as the Republic of
China, the official name of Taiwan seldom used internationally
because most country's recognize the rival communist Chinese
government in Beijing.
   Organizers pledged to refer to Taiwan as the Republic of China
during the telecast and promised the two-hour program would have 30
minutes of videotapes taken during recent weeks of the contestants
at Taiwan's scenic spots.
   The Miss Universe pageant generated much interest in Taiwan this
month but was pushed into the background last week when the
island's most violent protest in recent years broke out in Taipei
after a demonstration demanding increased government assistance to
farmers.
   The 18-hour street battle between protesters and police that
ended at dawn Saturday left more than 200 people injured and nearly
100 demonstrators detained.
   Missing from this year's Miss Universe pageant is long-time host
Bob Barker, who resigned after last year's competition in Singapore
to protest the awarding of fur coats to winners. He was replaced by
television personality Alan Thicke.
   The 11 celebrity judges include Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who
made history with their round-the-world, non-stop flight aboard the
Voyager two years ago, and Susan Ruttan of the television series
``L.A. Law.''
   Prizes for the 1988 Miss Universe include $76,000 in cash, a
Maserati convertible automobile, and a mink coat and mink jacket.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Sweep Through Iowa, Nebraska After Hitting South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rolled across parts of Iowa and Nebraska today
after storms in the South brought destructive winds, hail and a
tornado that damaged two homes in Alabama.
   The thunderstorms extended Sunday night from Alabama and
Mississippi to the Ohio Valley. A tornado touched down in
Pickensville, Ala., extensively damaging two homes as it ripped
down power lines and trees. Gas leaks also were reported. There
were no reported injuries.
   Elsewhere in Alabama, in Huntsville a barn was destroyed and
trees were damaged in nearby Plevna, where winds were estimated
between 50 and 60 mph. In Fayette, police reported power outages as
the storm system swept north. Large hail also pelted parts of
Madison County.
   Less destructive thunderstorms were reported across southern
Iowa and eastern Nebraska this morning.
   Rain fell from northern Arkansas across northeast Oklahoma and
parts of Missouri and Kansas to eastern Colorado. Rain also fell on
much of Nebraska and South Dakota.
   Dense fog loomed this morning over portions of the Northeast.
Visibility was near zero in parts of Maine and New Hampshire.
   Clear skies prevailed in Louisiana and Texas, as well as in
northern Minnesota across North Dakota to central Montana.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from eastern portions of the Central Plains to most of the nation
from the Mississippi River to the East Coast; showers and
thunderstorms from Ohio and Kentucky across the middle Mississippi
Valley to eastern Kansas and northern Arkansas; widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms in western Montana.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s for most of
the nation; in the 60s for the upper Great Lakes, the Central
Plains, the central Rockies and the Pacific coast; lower 90s in the
south Atlantic states and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; the 90s
for central California and between 95 and 105 in the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Laramie, Wyo., to 88 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Successful Sale of Steinbeck Possessions to Have Sequel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who staged a sale of items owned by the
late author John Steinbeck says the sale was so successful she will
produce a sequel in mid-June.
   About 60 percent of the estate was sold, said Sylvia Link, who
put together the auction of Steinbeck goods inspected by an
estimated 12,000 people on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
   ``If we had reduced prices, everything would be gone,'' she
said. Most estates are liquidated in three days, but Link and
Steinbeck's two sons decided not to drop the prices.
   Tom Steinbeck has said he probably will release more of his
father's items for sale, Link said.
   The day before the June sale will be reserved for students, who
showed great interest in Steinbeck items, she said.
   Link didn't know late Sunday how much money was raised at the
weekend sale.
   The lowest-priced items sold were cards for $5, and the most
expensive was a $4,200 desk, she said. Among the items left were a
$5,200 Chippendale corner cupboard, paintings that ranged in price
from $300 to $6,000, and lamps with prices starting at $300.
   Buyers purchased wine glasses, bow ties, a desk and a baptismal
gown. One shopper bought two oil paintings, one of which, he
learned from Tom Steinbeck, inspired the elder Steinbeck's poem
``Burning Bright.''

<HEAD>Government Orders Closings After Series Of Earthquakes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government ordered schools, government
offices and businesses in Guatemala City to close today after
dozens of small and moderate earthquakes shook the area in recent
days.
   The quakes have caused considerable alarm among the 2.8 million
residents of Guatemala City and the surrounding Guatemala province,
but no injuries or serious damage have been reported.
   On Sunday, Communications Minister Mario Lopez announced that
public buildings and businesses in the capital must close today
only as a precaution ``because of the situation caused by the
constant and continuous earthquakes.''
   The action was taken, he said, ``to avoid any (traffic)
congestion and so that families can be together in their homes.''
   The order does not affect essential services, such as hospitals
and the international airport.
   Col. Juan Ismael Morales Lopez, coordinator of the National
Emergency Committee, initially reported that just public and
private schools would be closed today, but the order was later
expanded to include businesses.
   The National Seismological Institute recorded 22 earthquakes on
Saturday and an additional 22 temblors by late Sunday evening.
   Eddy Sanchez, deputy director of the National Seismological
Institute, said the strongest quakes, two occurring Sunday
afternoon, registered 4.4 on the Richter scale. Some local radio
stations reported the Sunday quakes caused cracks in some houses
and broken windows in the downtown commercial area.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate
damage.
   The seismological service measured 22 quakes on Saturday, with
the strongest registering 4 on the Richter scale.
   The epicenter of the quakes was on the southwestern edge of the
capital near La Aurora International Airport, said Sanchez. On
Thursday, a quake registering 4 on the Richter scale was felt in
the area.
   A quake measuring 7 on the Richter scale devastated the capital
on Feb. 4, 1976, causing more than 22,000 deaths.

<TEXT>
   Some 200 police officers were converging
on the state capital for the signing of a gun control law that
makes Maryland the first state to ban the sale of Saturday Night
Specials.
   White House press secretary James Brady was invited to watch
Gov. William Donald Schaefer sign the bill into law today.
   Brady's wife, Sarah, was scheduled to be the main speaker for
the State House ceremony. She became active in gun control efforts
after her husband was seriously wounded in John Hinckley Jr.'s
assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981.
   Legislative leaders and other top officials who helped push the
bill through the General Assembly last month were to join dozens of
other invited guests, including police officers from neighboring
states, for the ceremony.
   Schaefer aides say the ceremony was not intended as a show of
force to pro-gun groups that are collecting signatures on petitions
to place the bill on the ballot for a public vote in November.
   Rather, the aides said, the ceremony was a way of sharing the
moment with the many people who helped get the bill passed despite
fierce opposition from the National Rifle Association and Maryland
gun groups.
   After losing to gun control forces in the legislature, the NRA
and other gun groups began a campaign to petition the bill to
referendum and persuade the voters to reject it in November. They
say they are confident they can obtain enough signatures to get the
measure on the ballot.
   State officials say the bill is unique because it creates a
board to determine which handguns can be sold in Maryland beginning
in 1990. It will not be illegal to possess guns that have not been
approved by the review board, but it will be against the law for
anyone to sell weapons not on the approved list.
   The law is primarily aimed at cheap handguns, known as Saturday
Night Specials, that are often used in street crimes and are the
weapon of choice for young criminals.
   The review board also is directed to omit from the list of
approved guns any weapons that have the serial number removed or
altered and guns made primarily of plastic that aren't easily
detected by metal detectors.

<HEAD>Nine Foreign Firms Begin Trading On Tokyo Exchange</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nine foreign securities firms, including six from
the United States, began trading today on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The nine were among 22 firms, 16 of them non-Japanese, that were
authorized last week to begin trading today on the exchange. The
others will join the market by June as they become ready.
   ``Of the 122 firms authorized to trade on the exchange, foreign
companies now number 22, or about 20 percent,'' said Toshiichi
Konuma, president of Nissan Securities and a member of the
exchange's board of directors.
   ``As we internationalize the Tokyo exchange, it has become
necessary to align the needs and desires of foreign firms with the
longstanding habits of Japanese traders,'' he said in an interview.
   The first six foreign members of the exchange joined in 1986
after the United States and Britain put strong pressure on Japan to
liberalize its equities markets. The 22 were among 40 firms that
applied for membership.
   ``To participate in transactions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, it
is very important to be a member,'' said Nick Bedford, managing
director of Japanese equities for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., one
of the American firms that began trading today. ``It's very
difficult to be accepted by domestic institutions. You have to be
part of the club.''
   The other foreign firms that began trading today included
Kidder, Peabody International Corp.; First Boston (Asia) Ltd.;
Shearson Lehman Brothers Asia Inc.; Smith Barney; Harris Upham
International Inc., all of the United States.
   Each firm paid $9.1 million to join the exchange. Six are
American, four British, and two each from France, Switzerland and
West Germany.

<TEXT>
   A substitute teacher hailed by police as a
hero in an elementary school shooting spree says she thought the
assailant was a classroom observer before the woman brandished a
handgun.
   Amy Moses, 29, says she tried to share with Laurie Dann the
excitement the second-graders had over an upcoming bicycle safety
test at Hubbard Woods Elementary School.
   ``I really wanted her to know why the children were so happy,''
Ms. Moses recalled at a news conference Sunday.
   ``My impression at the moment was that she was a college student
who had come to the school to observe the class, which is not
unusual,'' Ms. Moses said.
   Ms. Dann sat next to her for a while Friday before leaving the
classroom and later returning, apparently after going into a boys'
restroom and shooting Robert Trossman, 6.
   Ms. Dann, a baby sitter with a history of ``bizarre'' behavior,
then told Ms. Moses to herd the 24 children in her class together.
   Instead, Ms. Moses grabbed the woman's gunhand. But Ms. Dann
pulled a second gun, sprayed the classroom with bullets and then
fled.
   Ms. Dunn, 30, shot five students in the classroom, killing one
and seriously wounding the others.
   Winnetka Police Chief Herbert Timm said if Ms. Moses had
followed the assailant's orders, ``We would have probably had all
of the children shot.''
   Timm called Ms. Moses a hero.
   ``I really just went on automatic pilot. ... I can't explain how
unreal the whole situation was,'' Ms. Moses said, adding that the
gun looked like a toy at first. But after the initial shot, she
said, ``I was just frozen.
   ``When the first child went down, my first thought was, `They're
filming a movie and they forgot to tell me.' It wasn't until the
second shot that we all realized it was real.''
   Ms. Dann's face was ``expressionless'' and ``hard,'' she said.
   Police also credited Ms. Moses with giving a full description of
the assailant, who later barricaded herself in a suburban home
where she wounded a 20-year-old man and killed herself.
   Ms. Moses said she would return to the school.
   ``I love Hubbard Woods School,'' said Ms. Moses, who has worked
there in various capacities for the past five years and is studying
toward a master's degree in education.
   ``I know the faculty, the administration and a lot of the
children and some of the parents. ... I feel like the support
system will be real helpful to me. The children and the families _
everyone has been wonderful.''

<TEXT>
   A nuclear warhead was detonated
underground at the Nevada Test Site during the weekend while
visiting Soviet scientists made preparations to monitor a future
test, a Department of Energy spokesman said.
   The test, codenamed ``Laredo,'' was conducted at 3:30 p.m.
Saturday. It was originally scheduled Thursday but was postponed
because of strong winds blowing toward Las Vegas, about 75 miles to
the southeast.
   The U.S. Department of Energy, which oversees the testing
program, prohibits blasts under certain weather conditions.
   The nuclear warhead was detonated about 1,200 feet underground
as seven Soviet scientists spent the weekend in Mercury, Nev.,
about 32 miles from ground zero. The town houses test site workers.
   The Soviets are preparing for a joint experiment later this
summer in which the Soviets will monitor a U.S. test. More than two
dozen American scientists also are at the Soviet test site,
preparing to monitor a Soviet blast.
   Jim Boyer, an Energy Department spokesman, said there was
considerable ground motion noted by observers in a building eight
miles from ground zero.
   The test was not as large as the 150-kiloton maximum limit
adhered to by the United States and the Soviet Union, but Boyer
would not reveal the weapon's power.
   The blast appeared normal, he said, with no indications that
radioactivity had escaped the underground cavern. The test was the
fourth announced this year and the 679th announced test since
testing began in Nevada in January 1951.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse
Jackson today released details of a five-year federal budget
proposal which would increase taxes on the wealthy by $244 billion,
cut defense spending by $164 billion and increase spending on
social programs by $344 billion.
   ``We must forge a mandate to reverse Reaganomics,'' Jackson said
in a written statement accompanying his budget blueprint.
   The spending plan, called ``Paying for Our Dreams, A Budget Plan
for Jobs, Peace and Justice,'' also calls for $87 billion in cuts
in projected spending on non-defense programs and $104 billion in
tax increases on corporations.
   Jackson said his proposals would also cut the nation's deficit
from a projected $134 billion in 1993 to $49 billion.
   Jackson scheduled release of his budget proposal for an
appearance at California's state capitol, one of many campaign
stops Jackson is making in a bid for the state's 314 delegates up
for grabs in the June 7 primary.
   Repeating a campaign theme, Jackson said he would raise up to
$58 billion a year for social programs such as housing, education
and health care by freezing the military budget at its current $300
billion level for the next five years.
   ``If we do not propose bold alternatives, our social needs will
fall victim to the soldiers of austerity which were, in David
Stockman's phrase, hidden in the Trojan Horse of supply side
economics,'' he said, referring to President Reagan's first budget
director.
   ``I am for a strong defense. I also support a sound approach to
the military budget. Our plan would freeze military spending,''
Jackson said in the prepared statement. ``Even after the Jackson
cuts, real military spending will be 25 percent higher in 1993 than
in 1980.''
   The biggest tax increase in Jackson's budget plan would restore
the top 38.5 percent income tax rate on the nation's top 600,000
taxpayers. Other revenue measures would increase the minimum tax
rate on corporations, limit deductions for business meals to 50
percent, and impose a $7-billion-a-year ``polluters tax'' on
corporations.
   Among his proposed spending increases, described as ``new
investments,'' are programs which by 1993 would spend an extra $20
billion annually on education and job training, $17 billion on
housing programs, $12 billion on health and nutrition programs and
$3 billion more annually on AIDS programs.
   It also includes $5 billion more in transportation funding, $1.7
billion annually on environmental programs and $1 billion more
annually for international economic assistance.
   ``The Jackson budget chooses social and economic investment over
military spending, restores a measure of tax progressivity, and
promotes a balanced mix of monetary and fiscal policy. These
choices can only help the economy,'' he said.
   Following release of his budget proposal, Jackson scheduled a
visit to the nearby Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, on the
invitation of critics of that plant who are sponsoring a ballot
initiative to mandate permanent closing of the publicly owned
reactor.
   Jackson was continuing his campaign Sunday while Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis and Republican nominee-to-be George
Bush took weekend breathers.
   Jackson joined a rally of striking Teamsters at a Salinas frozen
foods processing plant on Sunday and administered wedding vows to
the daughter of a California educator who is a hostage in Lebanon.
   He told striking workers they are ``victims of economic
violence,'' and that the Democratic Party should stand with them by
adopting his 10-point plan for ``democracy in the work place.''
   The Democratic Party ``must stand with the working people. It's
the legacy of (President Franklin) Roosevelt. It's the unfinished
business of Dr. (Martin Luther) King,'' Jackson said.
   He said Dukakis, by contrast, had offered an economic vision
that ``is very conservative, very cautious, very inadequate.''
   ``The present conservative commitment by Mr. Dukakis to economic
change represents no hope for the homeless, no hope for the
homeless, the uneducated,'' Jackson said.
   Later, Jackson administered wedding vows to the daughter of
Alann Steen, who has been held hostage in Lebanon since Jan. 24,
1987.
   Jackson said he hoped by participating in the wedding of Rebecca
Steen, a 26-year-old paramedic in Santa Cruz, and Jim Monday, a
33-year-old Santa Cruz fireman, that ``in some unlit corner of
Lebanon, this news may reach and cheer a hostage.''
   ``We will not rest until all the hostages are set free. We will
not rest until the whole Middle East is set free, because the whole
Middle East is held hostage,'' Jackson said as he introduced the
newlyweds at a campaign rally immediately after administering their
vows.

   Syria rejected an Iranian offer to form a
joint military force to end the protracted fighting between two
Shiite Moslem factions in Beirut's southern slums, two newspapers
reported today.
   The 18 foreign hostages believed held in the slums were a key
factor in the negotiations between the two countries, one of the
newspapers said.
   Police said the Syrian-backed Amal militia and pro-Iranian
Hezbollah forces battled for an 18th straight day today, trading
fire with rockets and mortars and leaving five people dead and 46
wounded. The two factions are fighting for control of the 16 square
miles of slums. At least 271 people have been killed and 919
wounded since the fighting broke out May 6.
   Iran has proposed forming a joint military force with Syria and
moving into the slums to stop the fighting, according to reports
today in Beirut's two leading dailies, the independent An-Nahar and
the leftist As-Safir.
   The papers said that Amal officials and Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud,
Syria's military intelligence chief in west Beirut, rejected the
offer and insisted that the Syrian army take exclusive charge of
security in south Beirut.
   The papers said the Iranian offer was proposed by Deputy Foreign
Minister Hossein Sheikholeslam during an overnight meeting with
Hammoud and Amal officials. Representatives of Hezbollah, or Party
of God, also reportedly attended the meeting.
   An-Nahar said Sheikholeslam also declared two conditions for
approving a Syrian military intervention in the slums. They were:
   _Resolving the problem of the hostages, who include nine
Americans, ``in a way that serves the objective for which they were
kidnapped.'' He did not elaborate, but said it was a ``vital issue
for Iran.''
   _Guarantees that Hezbollah would be free to continue political
activities in the slums after the Syrian deployment.
   The two dailies said the differences probably will delay the
entry of Syrian troops into the slums while further contacts were
made between Syrian President Hafez Assad and Iranian President Ali
Khamenei.
   Syria has had 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles
massed around the slums since Sunday, after Hezbollah overran Amal
strongholds and seized control of 90 percent of the urban
battleground.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf
war with Iraq. But Iran's drive, through Hezbollah, to dominate
Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites has strained that alliance. The
Syrians consider Lebanon to be within their sphere of influence and
vital to their security.
   Amal spokesmen have complained publicly that delaying the Syrian
deployment will only prolong the plight of thousands of civilians
trapped in the slums.
   The Syrians, while seeking to avoid a confrontation with Iran
over Lebanon, appear determined to send their troops into south
Beirut, long a haven for Shiite kidnappers, hijackers and assassins.
   ``There's no way to stop the fighting other than a Syrian
military deployment,'' Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military
intelligence chief in Lebanon, said in a statement broadcast Sunday
by Beirut radio stations.
   He did not set a specific deadline for deployment in the
labyrinthine slums. But he noted: ``By the time we deploy, I hope
there will be no hostages left in captivity.'' He did not elaborate.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon are believed held by
exteremists linked to Hezbollah. Syria has warned that ``any harm
befalling the hostages will be regarded as an aggressive act
against Syria.''

<HEAD>Victim's Family Thought of Revenge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of a woman strangled in Central Park
says feelings of hate were strong enough to trigger thoughts of
killing Robert Chambers, the man convicted in the so-called
``preppy murder'' case.
   ``You go through a hundred feelings, a thousand feelings and a
thousand emotions when you lose a child. But it's a different thing
altogether when you lose a child by the hands of another,'' said
Ellen Levin, the mother of Jennifer Levin.
   ``You have feelings that you want to kill him and you have
feelings that you want to kill yourself,'' she said in an interview
broadcast Sunday on WNBC-TV's ``News Forum.'' ``There's a big
revenge feeling inside you. You have to work through these things,
but the hate is there and the hate is real.''
   Chambers was charged with murder for the Aug. 26, 1986,
strangulation of Miss Levin. The body of the 18-year-old was found
near the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   Chambers, 21, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on March 21 and is
serving a five-to-15 year prison sentence.
   Mrs. Levin said that while family members grieved their loss,
Chambers was free to walk around town and enjoy himself as he
awaited trial.
   ``He even had the audacity to come down to Jennifer's
neighborhood and was seen in a local restaurant, two blocks from
her home, cavorting with his friends and drinking and having a
great time,'' she said. ``All of this while we'd go to visit her at
her grave.''
   It was that image that triggered thoughts of revenge in all
members of the Levin family, she said.
   With effort, Mrs. Levin said, family members finally came to
terms with their feelings.
   ``We had to _ we're civilized people.''

<HEAD>Activists Stage Demonstration In Lithuania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Lithuanians defied government warnings
and staged a demonstration in the Baltic republic to commemorate
deportations of their countrymen 40 years ago, dissidents and
official media reported today.
   Tass, the official news agency, said about 300 people gathered
to shout anti-Soviet slogans on a central square of Vilnius, the
Lithuanian capital.
   ``Extremist elements, who do not like processes of
democratization and renovation of society which are under way in
the USSR, today made an attempt to stage an anti-social
manifestation in Vilnius,'' Tass said in describing Sunday's
protest.
   Telephone calls to Vilnius did not go through, so there was no
way to verify the information directly.
   However, one Moscow-based dissident, Valery Senderov, said he
learned from phone contacts with the region that a demonstration
occurred.
   Alexander Ogorodnikov, another Moscow activist, today said
several leading Lithuanian activists were held under house arrest
to prevent participation in the rally. Tass said no one was
detained in Sunday's protest even though some people ``violated
public order.''
   On Saturday, local authorities organized an official rally in
Vilnius, apparently to try to head off the unsanctioned protest.
Tass said thousands of people gathered then to pay tribute to the
``innocent victims of the violation of laws during the years of
Stalin's personality cult.''
   A New York-based group called Lithuanian Catholic Religious Aid
had reported last week that Lithuanian human rights activists
planned to demonstrate in Vilnius' Gediminas Square to pay tribute
to an estimated 200,000 Lithuanian, Polish and Jewish people
deported to Siberia in May 1948 at the order of dictator Josef V.
Stalin.
   The group said Vilnius city officials summoned four activists to
a meeting on Thursday to warn them against staging a demonstration.
   Other nationalist demonstrations were held in Vilnius in
February.
   Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire until the 1917
Bolshevik revolution, when it gained independence. It was included
in the Soviet sphere of influence in a secret agreement between
Stalin and Adolf Hitler before World War II. The Soviet military
moved in to take control in 1940.
   The United States does not recognize Lithuania and the two other
Baltic republics, Latvia and Estonia, as parts of the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Parliament Member, Two Blacks Killed In Separate Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the mixed-race
Parliament was gunned down in a church parking lot near here, and
two blacks died in a bomb blast at a political rally in the black
township of Soweto.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok today said police had no
evidence that the slaying of Peter Sam Jacobs, a member of the
majority Labor Party in the House of Representatives, was
politically motivated.
   ``The police have no reason at this stage to believe that the
murder was committed for political considerations but are
investigating the possibility that clashing personal interests
could have led to the crime,'' Vlok said.
   Jacobs, 42, was shot in the chest after getting into his car in
a church parking lot following a meeting Sunday night near his home
in Alberton, southeast of Johannesburg.
   According to press reports, Jacobs' wife and two other men were
with him in the car when a black assailant smashed the window on
the driver's side and fired a 9mm pistol at Jacobs.
   Jacobs was elected to Parliament in 1984 after a new
constitution was adopted creating segregated chambers for Asians
and mixed-race people along with the existing chamber for whites.
   The new constitution continued to exclude the black majority
from national politics. Anti-apartheid activists of all races
organized a boycott of the Asian and mixed-race elections which
helped keep the turnout below 20 percent.
   The Labor Party has remained estranged from the mainstream of
the anti-apartheid movement. However, its leader, the Rev. Allan
Hendrickse, has taken an increasingly confrontational stance toward
President P.W. Botha in the past year, demanding abolition of the
legislation which establishes racially segregated neighborhoods.
   In Soweto, the explosion that killed two blacks also injured
more than 30 during a Sunday afternoon rally held by the Sofasonke
Party, said police spokesman Noel Hartwell. The Sofasonke Party is
active in municipal politics in the huge township outside
Johannesburg.
   Police were investigating the cause of the explosion at the
outdoor gathering attended by about 100 people, the spokesman said.
He said there were no arrests.
   Municipal elections are scheduled for October, and the Sofasonke
Party is expected to take part. Although blacks have no voice in
national politics in South Africa, they can vote in local township
elections.
   Many black activists charge that the Sofasonke Party is
collaborating with the white-led government by participating in
black municipal politics.
   Hartwell said the meeting was a legal gathering that had been
authorized in advance. Under emergency regulations, outdoor
political gatherings are illegal unless prior permission is
obtained from the courts.

<HEAD>FTC: Bogus Legal Group Took In $3.3 Million Fraudulently</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta-based group posing as a national
prepaid legal services firm took in $3 million over a nine-month
period, fooling nearly 400 would-be franchisees, federal officials
say.
   The Lawyers Access Network sold distributorships for a prepaid
legal services plan from March to December 1987, according to
lawyers for the Federal Trade Commission, which has been
investigating the case.
   Prepaid legal services programs offer consumers basic legal
services for a flat annual fee, rather than an hourly rate.
   The firm gathered $3.3 million from 392 people around the
country who believed they were buying franchises by investing
amounts ranging from $5,500 to $25,000, FTC lawyers said. The
figure did not include any fees that might have been sent in by
consumers, they said.
   At best, investors may recover only 10 percent of their
investment, one FTC lawyer said.
   ``This thing makes the movie `The Sting' look small-time,'' said
Dave McQuade, a public relations director in suburban Philadelphia
who paid a $25,000 franchise fee in order to market memberships in
the network.
   ``It was so well set up,'' he said. ``They just had all their
bases covered.''
   The firm used false market research, baseless earnings
projections and bogus references to lure purchasers into believing
its program was successful, profitable and well-established, FTC
lawyers say.
   In a series of legal actions that began in March, the FTC has
shut down Lawyers Access and its marketing arm, American Legal
Distributors Inc., which operated out of the same office in the
Atlanta suburbs. The Federal Bureau of Investigation confiscated
dozens of records from the office during a search.
   According to the FTC, American Legal representatives brought
fancy brochures and a hard-sell pitch to franchise shows nationwide.
   The FTC also won a permanent injunction and default judgment for
more than $3 million earlier this month against firm officials
Patrick Pasley and Thomas Stockton.
   However, Pasley's attorney, Bruce Morris said, ``The fact of the
matter is, whatever representations that may have been made to
(distributors) that turned out to not be true were not made by Mr.
Pasley or with his knowledge.''
   Stockton claimed, ``I didn't set up the company; I was just an
employee.''
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Shoob signed an order freezing 13
bank accounts and other assets allegedly controlled by Pasley.
   FTC lawyer Norman Cramer said, ``There does not seem to be a big
pot of gold out there, at least that we or the FBI have been able
to discover.'' The victims, Cramer said, may at best receive
restitution of 10 percent.
   ``Prepaid legal services is a growth industry, and a legitimate
industry,'' Cramer told the Atlanta Constitution. ``A legitimate
plan along these lines might well be profitable. It's just these
guys went too far.''

<HEAD>US Officials Present Zoo With Alaskan Musk Oxen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials formally presented the Beijing Zoo
with two Alaskan musk oxen today as a Georgia woman who first
suggested the gift beamed fondly at the shaggy animals.
   Four-year-old Tanana, a female, and 3-year-old Koyuk, stood with
lowered heads in their outdoor enclosure as a horde of diplomats,
wildlife experts and reporters gathered on the other side of the
fence.
   ``They're beautiful,'' said Helen Miller, 65, of Moultrie, Ga.,
said of the 300-pound animals.
   Mrs. Miller began campaigning in 1980 for the United States to
present two musk oxen to China. She felt it was a matter of
``national honor'' to replace two U.S. animals, given to China in
1972, that had died of old age.
   The original pair had been presented when President Nixon made
his historic trip to China as the two nations normalized relations.
   ``It took lots of letter-writing, lots of telephone calls and
lots of trips, but I enjoyed all of it,'' Mrs. Miller said.
   ``I heard the Chinese children were very sad'' over the death of
the original oxen, she said. ``So I had to find out what a musk ox
was and ... How can you come by some.''
   As the dignitaries dispersed for a banquet, Tanana and Koyuk ate
grass in their enclosure and Chinese zoo-goers moved in for a look.
   ``They're not bad,'' said a Chinese man in a baseball cap.
   Tanana and Koyuk, named after Alaskan rivers, were born in
captivity in a University of Alaska research herd. About 3,000 to
4,000 of the rare, migratory animals live in Alaska, Canada, the
Soviet Union, Greenland and other areas of the Arctic.
   Mike Smith, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Bureau,
said the pair probably would thrive in Beijing despite temperatures
that sometimes soar into the 90s.
   U.S. Undersecretary of Interior Earl Gjelde, U.S. Ambassador
Winston Lord and more a dozen other American officials attended the
presentation.
   Gjelde called the oxen a ``fitting symbol'' of U.S.-Chinese
friendship and the two countries' commitment to wildlife
preservation. He read a message from President Reagan who said,
``May these musk oxen bring joy to the visitors of Beijing Zoo.''
   ``We will do our best to keep them well,'' promised Beijing Zoo
Deputy Director Shi Senming.
   Tanana and Koyuk actually arrived in China in late March but
were in quarantine until today.
   To the untrained eye, they looked less than jubilant over the
attention, alternately presenting horns to the onlookers and
turning their heads away.
   ``They don't have a wide range of expressions,'' Smith said.
``That's pretty much the normal posture.''
   He said in the wild musk oxen generally live to be 20 to 25.
   The United States gave the original pair of musk oxen in
exchange for giant pandas Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, still in the
Washington Zoo.

<HEAD>Italian Neo-Facist Leader Dies At 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Giorgio Almirante, a minor official in Benito
Mussolini's last government and the founder of Italy's neo-fascist
party, has died at the age of 73.
   Almirante died Sunday of complications from ischemia, a
condition caused by arterial blockage, according to hospital
officials quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA. He had suffered
from heart disease for years, ANSA said.
   Almirante was elected to the the Chamber of Deputies 11 times
from 1948 to 1987. He was once charged with helping a right-wing
terrorist, but the charges were dropped under a 1987 amnesty.
   His Italian Social Movement was the political heir to
Mussolini's fascist creation. By 1987, it had had become Italy's
fourth-largest party in Parliament, holding 5.9 percent of the
seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
   Another former party leader and founder, Pino Romualdi, died of
cancer Friday. The 77-year-old editor of the party newspaper was
elected to the Chamber of Deputies seven times between 1953 and
1979 and was a senator from 1983 to 1987.
   The party announced a joint funeral for the Almirante and
Romualdi Tuesday at St. Agnes, the Roman Catholic church in Rome's
Piazza Navona.
   Almirante, born June 27, 1914, joined Mussolini's last
government in 1943 as chief of staff of the Ministry of Popular
Culture. He served until Mussolini's fall in 1945.
   Mussolini, who came to power in 1922, was shot and hanged in a
public square in Milan in April 1945.
   In February 1979, the Chamber of Deputies waived Almirante's
parliamentary immunity so prosecutors could try him for reviving
the political equivalent of the outlawed Fascist Party. But he was
re-elected to Parliament and the immunity-lifting process had to
begin again.
   He never went to trial.
   Parliament waived his immunity again in 1981 and in 1984 so he
could face charges of aiding and abetting a right-wing terrorist
accused in a 1972 bombing that killed two Italian policemen.
   Almirante was accused of helping finance a surgical operation to
change the vocal cords of a bombing suspect to dodge his
identification by voice patterns.
   Those charges were dropped under a February 1987 amnesty that
covered offenses that would bring less than three years punishment.
   In December, Almirante stepped down as national secretary of the
neo-fascist party, which supports a halt to the influx of foreign
immigrants into Italy, a stronger presidency and tougher measures
against organized crime.
   He is survived by his wife, Rafaela, and their four children.

<TEXT>
   A year after a tornado leveled this
farming town, a Catholic bishop walked through the almost-rebuilt
community and blessed the houses, both old and new.
   On Sunday about 250 people gathered outside Saragosa's cemetery
to hear Bishop Raymundo Pena's memorial Mass to mark the first
anniversary of the tornado that killed 30 people and injured 170
others.
   Standing under a cloudless sky, Pena urged the survivors to
thank God for the strength ``to bear our cross and to rebuild, not
only our town, but also as we begin to rebuild our lives.''
   The physical rebuilding of the Mexican-American community is
almost complete. The tornado destroyed more than 60 houses, and the
Red Cross, Texas Department of Community Affairs and Catholic
diocese rebuilt most of them.
   After Mass, Pena walked around town and blessed all the houses.
   Among the structures destroyed by the tornado was the community
center, which was filled at the time with friends and relatives
attending a preschool graduation ceremony. Many of the victims _
some of them not even of school age _ died in the community
center's rubble. The new center will house 300 in its basement
tornado shelter.
   Also reduced to rubble was the church, whose brown brick
replacement is scheduled for completion in late June.
   The new church, which will seat 276 in its sanctuary, will be
designated a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. It will be the
first such shrine in the El Paso diocese, Pena said.
   The Catholic Church, Pena said, also has allocated more than
$300,000 for counseling services over five years to help survivors
recover from the tragedy.
   ``Psychologists tell us it takes five years for people to
recover from a trauma of this type,'' the bishop said. ``The
slightest little wind causes much fear in some people.''
   Some Saragosans said they wanted to reiterate a message
contained on a sign put up recently on the south edge of town by
the side of Highway 17: ``Thank you, America, for helping rebuild
Saragosa.''
   ``We're all very happy,'' said Julian Olivas, 34, of Saragosa.
``We thank people who helped us in one way or another. It's just a
little town; it wasn't even on the map. Now we have a lot of
publicity everywhere.''

<TEXT>
   The number of people killed in widespread
flooding in east China's rain-drenched Fujian province has climbed
to 78, a government official said today.
   Chen Zengpo, director of the Fuzhou Economic Commission,
reported the increased death toll and said he and other officials
were monitoring the level of the swollen Minjiang River following
heavy rains Friday and Saturday.
   He said the Minjiang had flooded near Fuzhou, the provincial
capital, but Mayor Hong Yongshi said no deaths had been reported in
that area.
   The most serious flooding was in Fujian province's northern
counties of Jianyang, Chongan and Zhenghe, where the deaths
occurred. More than 200 people were injured and more than 3,100
were forced to flee their homes, according to official media
reports today.
   Officials reported Sunday that 60 people had been killed in the
flooding.
   The nationally televised evening news showed residents wading
through waist-high water carrying household goods over their heads,
or poling through the streets on rafts of logs lashed together.
   The English language China Daily said 19,760 acres were flooded,
900 homes were damaged, 400 sections of road were destroyed and 400
bridges were swept away.
   It said 12 inches of rain fell on one town in a 20-hour period,
and that the water level of a major tributary of the Minjiang was
90 feet above normal.
   Fujian Vice Gov. Yu Dexin said Sunday that land transportation
to north Fujian was cut off and that Gov. Wang Zhaoguo had flown to
the area to supervise rescue operations.
   Unusual weather has plagued much of China this month. Hailstorms
killed at least 24 people and injured more than 250 in coastal and
central China, and a tornado in Guangdong province in southeast
China killed five people.

   After four decades, one of the Army's

World War II missions behind enemy lines.
   ``I don't know why it took them so long to pass out the medal,''
Joseph S. Simpson, 69, said Sunday after he was presented with a
Bronze Star during a ceremony at a dog show at the Solano County
Fairgrounds.
   Simpson, who also established the San Francisco Police

``meritorious achievement in ground combat against the armed enemy
during World War II,'' the citation said.
   As a member of the 33rd Infantry Scout Dog Platoon, Simpson and
his dog routinely went behind enemy lines on scouting missions,
which they completed safely.

   A member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee said today that ratification of a U.S.-Soviet
medium-range missile treaty is possible during the superpower
summit that begins in six days but that some senators still have
unanswered questions about the pact.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, interviewed on the CBS-TV ``This
Morning'' program about the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF)
treaty, requiring the destruction of all U.S. and Soviet missiles
with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles, said:
   ``There are still some issues that senators (Jesse) Helms
(R-N.C.), (Malcolm) Wallop (R-Wyo.), (Steve) Symms (R-Idaho) and
others wish to be debated and those will take a good part of this
week to conclude.''
   He added that he thinks action is ``unlikely ... before the
president leaves for Moscow, but said, ``I think it's still
possible that the treaty could be ratified while he's there.''
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev begin
five days of meetings Sunday. Reagan leaves for Moscow on Wednesday.
   Cohen said failure to ratify the treaty would be a serious
mistake.
   ``I think that the treaty is verifiable,'' he said. ``It's in
our interest to proceed, and to reject the treaty, I think, would
jeopardize not only our relationship with our allies but undermine
the president's ability to continue to serve as a spokesman for
this country.''
   The Senate on Friday crushed a bid by the Republican right wing
to tie the treaty to ending Soviet cheating on other arms control
accords. All five sections of an amendment offered by Symms were
overwhelmingly rejected and other attempts to change the treaty
were rebuffed.
   But Senate leaders indicated that ratification before the summit
would be difficult. Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
said he may keep the Senate working late into the night this week
and may schedule a Saturday session.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., blamed the conservative GOP senators
for the delay, saying they do not want to see a successful summit.
   ``The treaty is going to be approved by the Senate. It's just a
question of whether we do it before or after the summit,'' Bumpers
said on the CBS show. ``I think people who are opposed to the
treaty feel that if it is approved by the Senate before then, the
summit will be successful and they don't want a successful summit.''

   Vandals stenciled three red swastikas on a Dade
County temple, marking the 44th anti-Semitic incident reported in
Florida this year, according to an official of a Jewish
anti-discrimination group.
   The phrase ``Die Jew'' was also spray-painted on a terrace
leading to the entrance of the Bet Breira Congregation, police
said. The vandalism was discovered Sunday morning on the front of
the modern-design synagogue.
   ``There is a great deal of prejudice and hatred in Dade County,
and this act shows that more integration between Anglos, blacks,
Hispanics, Jews and gentiles needs to take place,'' said Barry
Tabachnikoff, rabbi at the 450-member temple.
   The temple was desecrated sometime between late Saturday and
early Sunday, police said. There are no suspects.
   ``I do feel the attack was premeditated because of the
stencils,'' said Arthur Teitelbaum, Southern area director of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   Teitelbaum said he was concerned about the increase in
anti-Semitic vandalism. A total of 44 incidents have been reported
in Florida this year, compared with 64 last year.
   Vandalism was also discovered Sunday at Miami Killian High
School, about 1{ miles from the temple; vandals used a stencil to
paint five red swastikas and the phrases ``Hitler Lives'' and
``Neo-Nazi Rules.'' Police said they didn't know whether the
incident was related to that at the temple.
   Four teen-agers were recently sentenced in Dade Juvenile Court
to 200 hours of community service and ordered to pay $14,800 in
damages for smashing windows and painting anti-Jewish slogans on
another Dade temple Feb. 26.
   Desecration of a house of worship is a third-degree felony
punishable by a maximum five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

<HEAD>No Mention Of `Killer Rabbit' In Carter's New Outdoor Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELLIJAY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jimmy Carter says that on second thought, he
probably should have included the ``killer rabbit'' episode in his
new book on his outdoor adventures ``just to explain there was
nothing to it.''
   ``An Outdoor Journal: Adventures and Reflections,'' published by
Bantam Books, portrays the former president as an avid hunter and
fisherman who relishes the solitude and physical and intellectual
stimulation the activities provide.
   Carter writes vividly of stalking wild turkey in the Georgia
woods, bagging ducks in Arkansas, battling trophy rainbow trout in
Alaska and fighting a blue marlin in the Virgin Islands.
   But the 224-page book, scheduled for release this week, omits
the most famous outdoor adventure of his presidency _ the 1979
killer rabbit episode, in which he beat back with a paddle a rabbit
he said was swimming toward his canoe during a fishing trip near
Plains.
   ``I guess I should have (included it) just to explain there was
nothing to it,'' Carter said in an interview at his mountain cabin
near here last week. ``But I don't want to get into another
altercation with the press about it. That was a contrivance of the
press.''
   The episode prompted numerous editorial cartoons and jokes at
Carter's expense, and the rabbit was dubbed the ``killer rabbit''
or the ``banzai bunny.''
   Some skeptics claimed that rabbits do not swim, but Carter said
a blowup of an official White House photograph showed the animal
was clearly a rabbit.
   He told reporters at the time, ``It was a fairly robust-looking
rabbit who was swimming, apparently with no difficulty.'' He said
it would have been ``an unpleasant situation for me and the
rabbit'' if the animal had gotten into the canoe.

<HEAD>Central Committee Adopts Blueprint For Reforms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: EDITS throughout to UPDATE with Ligachev announcing adoption
of party platform, other details. NO PICKUP.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN_THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee today
adopted a new platform for implementing Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic and social reforms, the No. 2 Kremlin official
announced.
   Yegor K. Ligachev told a foreign policy meeting the Central
Committee had chosen Gorbachev, the party general secretary, to
present the blueprint to an important party conference next month.
   ``We have every reason to say that today's plenum has worked out
a platform for the party to use in forging ahead to the all-union
party conference,'' Ligachev said after the 2{ hour meeting of the
Central Committee, the party's 300-plus member policy-making body.
   Ligachev said the Central Committee had a ``very interesting and
lively debate,'' and then adopted the theses formulated by the
ruling Politburo for the June 28 party conference. These, he said,
``thoroughly analyze'' developments since an April 1985 party
plenum laid the theoretical basis for the 57-year-old Gorbachev's
reforms.
   The platform also makes ``a number of important suggestions and
proposals relative to the implementation of perestroika, glasnost,
democratization and the implementation of a healthy political
atmosphere,'' Ligachev said.
   The announcement of the plenum results by Ligachev could be one
more sign that the 67-year-old ideology chief is not in serious
political trouble.
   Reports of a major policy dispute between Gorbachev and Ligachev
surfaced in Moscow last month. The reports suggested Ligachev had
endorsed publication in March of an article in the newspaper
Sovietskaya Rossiya that questioned whether Gorbachev's reforms had
gone too far. Ligachev has given speeches relecting a more
conservative approach than Gorbachev.
   Ligachev is chairman of the Commission on Foreign Affairs of the
Soviet of the Union, one of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet,
the nominal parliament. He reported on the plenum at the opening of
a joint meeting of that commission and its counterpart in the other
Supreme Soviet chamber, the Soviet of Nationalities. The
commissions are considering whether to recommend ratification of
the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate medium- and shorter-range
nuclear missiles.
   Plenary meetings of the Central Committee often take place the
day before the Supreme Soviet, the nation's nominal parliament,
holds its semiannual meetings. The 1,500-member legislature begins
a meeting Tuesday that may include ratification of the
intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty signed by President
Reagan and Gorbachev at the December summit in Washington.
   The plenum took place six days before Reagan is scheduled to
arrive in Moscow for his fourth meeting with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev is expected to use the June 28 special party
conference to tighten his hold on the party apparatus and to rout
party officials hostile or indifferent to his ambitious program for
``perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring.
   In speeches earlier this year, Gorbachev also has said the June
conference will consider reforms to strengthen the legal and
judicial systems.
   Gorbachev has called for creating a system to replace aging
party officials and has been especially critical of the 18-year
rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev as a period of stagnation and
corruption. Brezhnev died in 1982.
   Dmitri A. Lisovolik, chief of the U.S. section of the Central
Committee's International Department, has said the party will
consider limiting the Communist Party general secretary to two or
three eight-year terms.
   Gorbachev said in an interview last Wednesday with the
Washington Post newspaper and Newsweek magazine that he endorsed
the proposal.
   Membership on the ruling party Politburo can be changed at a
Central Committee plenum.
   At the last Central Committee plenum, on Feb. 17-18, former
Gorbachev protege Boris N. Yeltsin, who had been fired as Moscow
party leader in November, was removed from his non-voting seat on
the Politburo.

<TEXT>
   The Israeli army today
reopened hundreds of elementary schools in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip after keeping them shut for nearly four months
because of the Arab uprising.
   Military officials said the move was in response to a marked
decline in violent incidents in the disputed territories in the
last few weeks.
   On Sunday, however, three Palestinians died in one of the worst
days of violence in the occupied territories this month.
   ``If they (the children) are in school then they won't be in the
streets, but that is not what motivated us to open the schools,''
Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the army's Civil Administration
which runs daily affairs in the West Bank, told army radio today.
   ``The whole education system was examined. Teachers who were
connected with the rioting are not teachers today,'' he said.
   The Supreme Court today heard an appeal by Mubarak Awad, an
Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience, who asked the panel
to scrap a deportation order against him. The court said it would
rule at a later date.
   The government jailed Awad earlier this month and said he would
be expelled for playing a leading role in the Arab uprising. But in
today's arguments, prosecutor Nili Arad said deportation
proceedings began mainly because Awad violated immigration laws.
   Awad, born in Arab east Jerusalem, spent 15 years in the United
States and became a U.S. citizen before returning to Jerusalem in
1985.
   His attorney, Avraham Gal, said immigration laws did not apply
to his client and other Arab residents of east Jerusalem annexed by
Israel after the 1967 Middle East War.
   Also today, Israel radio reported the government charged two
editors of the newspaper Derech Hanitzotz with being members of a
terrorist organization and having contacts with foreign agents.
   Roni Ben Efrat and Michal Shwartz were jailed pending trial and
could face up to 40 years if convicted.
   The government said the two women were recruited to start the
pro-Palestinian newspaper by the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO faction. The radio said four
other journalists for the Hebrew-language paper also were jailed
but but not yet charged.
   In the West Bank, elementary school girls in gray-striped
uniforms and boys in street clothes could be seen trudging the
roads to schools.
   The army said high schools in the territories will open next
week if the relative calm persists.
   Israel television reported some classes would resume today at
Gaza's Islamic University, a key site of protests when the Arab
uprising began on Dec. 8. More than 190 Arabs have been killed
since the uprising started. An Israeli soldier and an Israeli
settler also were killed.
   The Israeli army shut nearly 1,200 schools in Gaza and the West
Bank on Feb. 2, at the height of unrest, keeping about 475,000
Palestinian children and teen-agers away from their classrooms.
   On Sunday, city officials reopened 31 public schools in
Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem. Up to 70 percent of 16,000 students
attended classes, which proceeded without disruption, said Amir
Cheshin, the city's adviser on Arab Affairs.
   Hussein Shurie, director of a private college in El Bireh, said
he knew of many teachers who gave private lessons for students
during the long closure.
   He noted that leaflets put out by underground leaders of the
uprising urged students to return to school. ``They think it is one
of the aims of the `intefadeh' (uprising) _ to be educated,'' he
said.
   On Sunday, a Palestinian mother and son died when their car
caught fire from a firebomb near the West Bank city of Tulkarem, 65
miles northwest of Jerusalem, military and Arab sources said.
   The bombing occurred as Shamshe Kadah, 65, and Mohammed Salah
Ghanem, 36, drove home after leaving Ghanem's wife at Tulkarem
Hospital where she later gave birth to a girl, hospital officials
said.
   Israeli military sources and Arabs in Shuweika village near
Tulkarem said the firebomb was apparently thrown by Arabs aiming at
an Israeli army jeep.
   Also Sunday, Kawther Miri, 23, died of a bullet wound suffered
during a weekend clash with troops at a refugee camp in Tulkarem,
hospital officials said.

   Bombs blew up two cars owned by Turkish
diplomats early today, just hours before the arrival of Turkey's
foreign minister. A left-wing terrorist group claimed
responsibility.
   No injuries were reported in the bombings in downtown Athens.
   A few hours after the explosions, Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz
of Turkey arrived for talks on disputes that last year brought the
two NATO allies close to war. Yilmaz was greeted at the airport by
his Greek counterpart, Carolos Papoulias. They went to a seaside
hotel where discussions will take place through Thursday.
   Asked whether the bomb attacks would affect the atmosphere for
the talks, Papoulias said: ``I don't see how they can affect it.''
   The left-wing November 17 group, which has taken responsibility
for more than a dozen political killings in Greece, claimed
responsibility for the bombings in a statement sent to the Athens
daily Ethnos. Security police said the claim appeared genuine.
   The five-page typewritten statement was published in today's
edition of the left-wing newspaper, saying the group had targeted
``the fascist Turkish regime which has occupied Cypriot territory
by force for the past 14 years.''
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government condemned the
attacks, which damaged two cars belonging to Turkish Embassy
administrative officials.
   ``The government expresses abhorrence for these criminal bomb
attacks and condemns most categorically every form of terrorism,
whatever its origin,'' a government statement said.
   Bombs exploded at 2:20 a.m. and 2:25 a.m. beneath cars parked
300 yards apart in a downtown residential area.
   Greek bomb disposal experts defused other devices left beneath
two other cars parked near the Turkish Embassy building on
Vassileos Georgiou Street close to the city center, said the
security police spokesman who requested anonymity in accordance
with Greek practice.
   All the cars carried green diplomatic license plates.
   Yilmaz's visit is seen as a test run for a scheduled June 13-15
trip to Athens by Premier Turgut Ozal, the first by a Turkish
premier to Greece in more than 30 years.
   Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war in March 1987 over
oil drilling rights in the Aegean Sea.
   The talks are being held under tight security following
anti-Turkish threats by Cypriots, Kurdish political refugees and
Greeks who formerly lived in the Turkish city of Istanbul.
   The Cypriots are protesting the continuing presence of an
estimated 30,000 Turkish troops in northern Cyprus. Turkey invaded
the Mediterranean island in 1974 following an Athens-inspired coup.
   Since then, the island has been split into separate Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sectors.
   November 17 previously has targeted American diplomats and
leading Greek businessmen. The group is named for the day in 1973
that troops crushed a student rebellion against the 1967-74
military dictatorship.

   First, the incumbent questioned his
challenger's religious convictions and branded him a carpetbagger.
Then the Democratic primary race in the 1st Congressional District
really got nasty.
   In fact, Roll Call, a weekly Washington publication that calls
itself ``the newspaper of Congress,'' said the contest ``is turning
into the nastiest primary in the country.''
   Rep. Carroll Hubbard and Lacey T. Smith, who seeks to deny the
incumbent the nomination for an eighth term in Tuesday's election,
have traded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct.
   Hubbard has been accused of improperly directing a congressional
investigation into a bank loan received by Smith.
   In turn, Hubbard has slammed Smith as a carpetbagger, accusing
him of moving back to Kentucky for the sole purpose of seeking
political office. Smith also has been haunted by a legal
entanglement 14 years ago.
   There are no statewide races on the primary ballot, and only one
other congressional race has drawn any interest. Democratic Rep.
Romano Mazzoli is running hard against former television reporter
Jeffrey Hutter in the 3rd District in Louisville. Three Republicans
are running for the 3rd District nomination.
   Smith's race against Hubbard is the incumbent's first tough
challenge since he won the seat in 1974 by upsetting Rep. Frank
Stubblefield.
   Hubbard, 50, has a well-financed campaign and is advertising
extensively in the mostly rural district. One often-repeated jingle
on Hubbard commercials advises Smith to ``Pack up your troubles in
your carpetbag and move, Lacey, move.''
   Smith, 48, moved to Madisonville in August from Florida but has
Kentucky ties. He was a state senator from Louisville in the early
1970s. And he has said that he and his wife have more than 200
relatives living in the district.
   In 1974, Smith was tried on a charge of obtaining money under
false pretenses for allegedly soliciting a bribe from an insurance
agency while he was on the staff of the Louisville mayor. He was
acquitted, and Smith said the charge was brought by an overzealous
Republican prosecutor seeking re-election.
   As for Hubbard, a complaint was filed with the House Standards
of Official Conduct Committee alleging that he improperly ordered
an investigation of a $2.5 million loan Smith received from a
Washington bank.
   The General Accounting Office investigated the loan at the
request of a banking subcommittee that Hubbard chairs but found no
wrongdoing. A GAO official said the agency would not have
investigated if it had known Smith was a candidate.
   Smith has charged that Hubbard is an incompetent lawmaker who
misses important votes and has never passed any significant
legislation. Hubbard counters that Smith's only goal is election to
Congress from a district he does not know.
   The Louisville Courier-Journal, the state's largest newspaper,
reluctantly endorsed Hubbard, saying:
   ``They've spent a lot of time and money accusing each other of
incompetence and sleaze. What's so depressing is that, when you
examine the candidates, the kinds of charges we've heard seem
believable.''
   In a letter to supporters before Smith formally announced his
candidacy, Hubbard sent along copies of church bulletins, voter
registration records and corporate publicity releases showing that
Smith was baptized in a West Palm Beach, Fla., Baptist church on
Aug. 30, four days after he registered to vote in the 1st District.
   Smith later transferred his membership to First Baptist Church
of Madisonville.
   ``I'm glad Lacey Smith has become a Baptist since he's come to
our area,'' Hubbard said in the letter. ``But I find it ironic that
he joined the (Florida church) four days after he registered to
vote in Madisonville.''
   Hubbard's father was a well-known Southern Baptist preacher in
the area for many years.
   Though no reliable polls indicate how the race is going, Hubbard
said he has been the victim of a ``vicious, vitriolic, venomous''
campaign conducted by ``a desperate man trying to do something to
reverse the tide here in the last week.''
   Smith, who recently sold his interest in a Madisonville
engineering firm, said Hubbard has been a ``pen pal congressman''
interested only in his own self-preservation.
   ``If it's taken a nasty turn, it hasn't been because of anything
that I've done,'' Smith said. ``People say that's negative because
his record's negative.''

   GOP national officials will try to mediate a
dispute that could result in Georgia's Republican Party showing up
at the presidential nominating convention in New Orleans with
competing delegations.
   At the state Republican convention over the weekend, two slates
were elected _ one after party regulars stormed out of the Albany
Civic Center.
   Roger Allen Moore, general counsel for the national Republican
Party, said GOP officials would hear from both sides in the dispute.
   The case first would go before the party's nine-member contest
committee, which would report its findings to the credentials
committee, Moore said. A ruling by the 106-member credentials
committee could be appealed to the national convention in New
Orleans this summer, he added.
   Party regulars elected Fred Cooper, state chairman for the
George Bush campaign, to head the state's 48-member delegation to
this summer's convention, but not until after they had angrily left
the civic center Saturday.
   About 900 dissidents remained at the civic center afterward and
elected a slate headed by Brant Frost, state chairman for Pat
Robertson's failed presidential campaign.
   All 48 delegates are required to vote for Bush at the
convention, since Bush won every county in the state during
Georgia's March 8 presidential primary.
   Robertson captured only 13 percent of the state vote, but his
backers, many of whom are party newcomers, organized in an effort
to influence the party platform and the selection of a vice
presidential nominee.
   The turmoil this weekend stemmed from efforts by state GOP
Chairman John Stuckey and other party regulars to deny
Robertson-dominated county delegations a chance to participate in
the state convention.
   ``This will probably wind up in an awful mess,'' said national
committeeman Carl Gillis. ``All he (Stuckey) had to do was let
these folks be seated.''

   A power surge or short circuit at a
Southern Bell switching station in Charlotte plus workers' failure
to notice an alarm light knocked out phone service for up to
400,000 North Carolinians, officials say.
   Southern Bell spokesman Ladd Baucom said Sunday a
battery-powered system took over after the power failure, but when
no one noticed the alarm, the batteries ran down and service was
disrupted.
   ``We missed it,'' he said. ``Ideally, if we had caught the
alarms when we should have, it would have been fixed.''
   Henceforth, additional workers will be posted at the switching
station's alarm area to monitor it round-the-clock seven days a
week, Baucom said.
   Saturday's nine-hour scattered telephone failures affected
customers from Boone in the western mountains to just west of
Rockingham, about 180 miles away, frustrating callers and wreaking
havoc with airline and retail computer systems.
   Calls to 911 were silenced as well, leading police in Charlotte,
the state's largest city, to post officers at fire departments and
major intersections where people who might need help could get them.
   Most officers worked double shifts Saturday, said Chip Bailey,
spokesman for the Mecklenburg County Police Department, which
includes Charlotte.
   ``We don't have any horror stories to come out of it so far,''
Bailey said Sunday after service had been restored.
   The police spokesman said he knew of no crimes, fires or
accidents going unanswered because of the telephone troubles.
   ``In fact, not too long after 911 came back, we got (a report
of) an armed robbery in progress and were able to stop it,'' Bailey
said.
   Other phone customers were not so lucky.
   ``It's going to affect us massively,'' said Carrol Mane,
training manager at Ivey's department store in Gastonia.
   ``We're requiring credit approval on all credit purchases and
we're really going to have a problem closing tonight because we
can't transfer out data,'' she said Saturday evening.
   Martha Eddins, a spokeswoman for Wachovia Bank in Winston-Salem,
said automated teller machines in the affected areas could not
operate without long-distance phone lines to connect computer data
bases.
   The situation also caused confusion at Charlotte-Douglas
International Airport, where arriving passengers could not call
relatives or friends or even a taxicab to pick them up, said J.F.
Terrell of the airport's security force.
   Terrell said airline reservation clerks were forced to process
by hand tickets normally printed and filed by computer.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether two U.S. Postal Service workers involved in California
traffic accidents while delivering mail must face criminal charges
in state court.
   The justices said they will hear a Reagan administration attempt
to transfer the prosecutions to federal court.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that state
courts have authority in the cases, which stem from accidents in
Santa Clara County.
   In one, Kathryn Isabella Mesa was accused of misdemeanor
manslaughter after her mail truck collided with and killed a
bicyclist. In the other, Shabbir A. Ebrahim was charged with
speeding and failing to yield after his mail truck collided with a
police car.
   Both defendants initially succeeded in having their cases
transferred to a federal court but the 9th Circuit court sent the
prosecutions back to state courts.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that the cases should be
handled in federal court to prevent possible bias against the mail
carriers.
   ``The attentuated federal interest in ensuring that their trial
be unbiased does not justify an invasion of the state's authority
to police its streets,'' the appeals court said. ``There is simply
no reason to believe that, on a systematic basis, postal workers
will not get a fair shake in state court.''
   The appeals court added that overburdened federal courts ``do
not need a new category of pesky cases turning solely on state
law.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers said
the appeals court ruling violates a federal law aimed at protecting
federal officials in the performance of their official duties.
   The appeals court decision would ``permit states ... to
undermine federal policies and programs,'' the appeal said, adding
that it ``presents a potential threat to federal (legal) supremacy
anywhere federal policies encounter local hostility.''
   The 9th Circuit court noted that the federal law providing for
removal of such cases to federal court was enacted in response to
New England's opposition to a trade embargo declared during the War
of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain.
   Federal customs officials were given authority then to board
vessels in order to collect duties, assuring they would avoid
prosecution in state courts for any alleged misconduct in the
performance of their duties.
   The appeals court said there is no claim by the two mail
carriers that their allegedly illegal conduct was justified by the
duties they were performing.
   ``There is no effort on the state's part to criminalize activity
important to federal interests, as there was during the War of
1812,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Mesa vs. California, 87-1206.

<HEAD>Libel Award Against Virginia Newspaper Left Intact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a $100,000
libel award won against a Richmond, Va., newspaper and one of its
reporters by a high school teacher in that city.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear the Richmond
Times-Dispatch's challenge of the judgment won by Vernelle
Lipscomb, a longtime English teacher in Richmond's public schools.
   Ms. Lipscomb, then head of the English department at Thomas
Jefferson High School, sued over an Aug. 16, 1981, article that ran
atop the newspaper's front page.
   In it, students and their parents were quoted as calling Ms.
Lipscomb ``disorganized, erratic, forgetful and unfair,'' and
charging that she ``demeans and humiliates students.''
   Ms. Lipscomb was quoted as saying she had been advised by her
lawyer not to talk about the complaints.
   A state court jury, finding that the article included libelous
statements made with ``actual malice,'' awarded Ms. Lipscomb $1
million in compensatory damages from the newspaper and Charles E.
Cox, the reporter who wrote the article.
   The jury also ordered Cox to pay $45,000 in punitive damages.
   The presiding judge later reduced the compensatory-damages award
to $100,000.
   The Virginia Supreme Court last Oct. 30 ruled that the trial
judge erred in considering Ms. Lipscomb a public official rather
than a private citizen for purposes of the libel suit.
   Public officials who sue for libel must prove the sued-over
statement was false and was made with actual malice _ either
knowledge of or reckless disregard of its falsity.
   Private citizens who sue for libel have an easier burden of
proof _ that the statement was false and was made negligently.
   The state Supreme Court, because it ruled that Ms. Lipscomb is
not a public figure, ordered the punitive-damages award against Cox
dropped.
   But the state court upheld the $100,000 judgment, ruling that
there was sufficient evidence of negligence.
   In the appeal acted on today, the newspaper's lawyers argued
that Ms. Lipscomb should have been considered a public official who
could not win her libel suit unless she proved actual malice.
   The case is Richmond Newspapers Inc. vs. Lipscomb, 87-1636.

<HEAD>Six Men Convicted as Members of Colombo Family Lose Appeals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six men convicted as members of the Colombo
crime family in New York City and one of their associates lost
Supreme Court appeals today.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the rights
of crime syndicate boss Carmine Persico and six others were not
violated in the government's racketeering prosecution.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the seven
convictions last October, rejecting numerous arguments. The
defendands said, for example, they were subjected to double
jeopardy and that the jurors should have been sequestered during an
eight-month trial.
   Persico was sentenced to 39 years in prison on racketeering
conspiracy charges, for conspiring to extort money from concrete
construction firms, for paying a gratuity to a federal prison
official and for offering a $20,000 bribe to a federal official to
transfer him to a different prison.
   Persico also has been convicted in a separate racketeering trial
with heads of other crime families and sentenced to 100 years in
prison.
   His eldest son, Alphonse Persico, and John DeRoss, described by
the government as an underworld captain, each were sentenced to 12
years in prison.
   Anthony Scarpati and Andrew Russo, each a reputed captain in the
Colombo family, were sentenced to 35 years and 14 years,
respectively.
   Dominic Cataldo, described as a soldier in the family, was
sentenced to 14 years. And Hugh McIntosh, a Colombo crime family
associate, received a 10-year sentence to run consecutively to a
nine-year term he already was serving on a bribery conviction.
   Prosecutors said the Colombo family was involved in a wide range
of criminal activity _ including loansharking, narcotics
trafficking, extortion, labor racketeering, theft and bribery.
   The cases are Russo vs. U.S., 87-1314; Carmine Persico vs. U.S.,
87-1323; Alphonse Persico, DeRoss and Scarpati vs. U.S., 87-1324;
Cataldo vs. U.S., 87-1553; and McIntosh vs. U.S., 87-6597.

<HEAD>Iranian Ships Sighted In Strait of Hormuz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large Iranian warship, two frigates and
a landing craft sailed in coastal waters in the Strait of Hormuz
today, shipping executives reported. Iran said it was conducting
naval manuevers in the area.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
vessels could not be identified as to type or number. But it
appeared that one, described as ``very large,'' could be a
destroyer.
   None of Iran's three destroyers has been active in the Persian
Gulf for more than a year.
   Iran announced Sunday that it was carrying out naval exercises
in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and that the 50 ships
participating included ``missile carrying destroyers, destroyers,
missile launching frigates and personnel carriers.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported today that
Iranian armed forces staged amphibious maneuvers in the Gulf of
Oman to demonstrate that the U.S. Navy has not crippled its naval
forces.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the maneuvers involved
``various land, sea and air operations'' and included electronic
jamming of radar and radio communications, aircraft detection,
paratroop drops and air raid interceptions.
   IRNA quoted an unidentified naval intelligence officer as saying
the exercises were aimed at ``disproving U.S. claims that it had
crippled half the hardware of the Iranian Navy'' in clashes on
April 18.
   The United States has not claimed to have cut Iran's navy by
half, but said its warships and combat jets sank or crippled six
Iranian vessels in the daylong fighting.
   These included the 1,540-ton, British-built frigate Sahand, a
fast attack patrol boat and two armed speedboats sunk, the frigate
Sabalan disabled and a speedboat probably sunk.
   Iran has said more than 40 of its men were killed and several
vessels, including the Sahand and Sabalan, were damaged by missiles
and bombs. The only U.S. casualties were two Marine Corps pilots
killed when their AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship was lost, possibly
to Iranian fire.
   The United States has since broadened the role of U.S. warships
in the gulf, enabling them to intervene in attacks by Iranian
gunboats on neutral shipping under any non-belligerent flag and in
international waters.
   Jane's Fighting Ships, an authoritative naval reference, says
Iran's forces include three destroyers: the Damavand, a 3,360-ton
destroyer built for the Royal Navy in 1945 and two former American
warships launched in 1944, the 3,320-ton destroyers Babr and Palang.
   All of these vessels, sold to Iran in the late 1960s and early
1970s, were fitted with surface-to-surface and anti-aircraft
missiles and other weapons, but none have been reported operating
in at least the past year.

<HEAD>Court Says Fixed Annuities Fall Under Securities Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case the insurance
industry was watching closely, today let stand a ruling that
millions of so-called fixed annuities are subject to federal
securities law.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that fixed
annuities paying fluctuating interest rates may be regulated the
same as stocks and bonds.
   Fixed annuities traditionally have been regarded as insurance
contracts because investors never risk their principal. Annuity
holders are assured of receiving the money contributed plus a
certain amount of interest in payments made at regular intervals.
   In 1985, 10 million individual annuities representing $24
billion in present and deferred annual payments were outstanding,
according to insurance industry sources.
   Some 33 million Americans were covered under private pension
plans funded by group annuity contracts that received $35 billion
in contributions during that year and paid out $10 billion in
benefits.
   There also existed seven million ``universal life'' policies _ a
form of annuities _ representing $564 billion of insurance in 1985.
   Holders of fixed annuities are assured of a minimum rate of
return on contributions. And most annuity plans provide for
``excess interest'' paid at the discretion of the annuity company.
   In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that so-called variable
annuities, those that do not assure any minimum interest payments
on contributions, may be treated as securities regulated by federal
law.
   But a ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last April
15 marked the first time a fixed annuity was treated as a security.
   Beverly Otto sued the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co.
(VALIC) in 1982, charging the Texas-based stock insurance company
with failing to disclose the method it used to calculate
excess-interest payments.
   Her ``class action'' lawsuit was filed in behalf of all Illinois
residents who invested in VALIC's fixed annuity program between
Oct. 17, 1975 and Aug. 2, 1982. The suit contended that the fixed
annuity is a ``security,'' and that VALIC had violated anti-fraud
provisions of federal securities law.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that the fixed
annuity is not a security.
   But the 7th Circuit court reversed that ruling, reinstating the
suit.
   The appeals court relied, in part, on a 1986 rule issued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission providing certain annuities with
a ``safe harbor'' exclusion from federal securities law.
   The appeals court said VALIC's fixed annuity did not qualify for
such treatment because its excess-interest rate on existing
deposits could be changed at any time at VALIC's discretion.
   In the appeal acted on today, VALIC said, ``The court's ruling
will unquestionably increase insurance companies' costs of doing
business, which will make annuities more expensive for consumers
and limit the availability of these policies.''
   The appeal was supported in ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs
submitted by the American Council of Life Insurance, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, the National Association of
Life Companies and the National Organization of Life and Health
Insurance Guaranty Associations.
   The case is VALIC vs. Otto, 87-600.

<HEAD>Marcos Says Swiss Supreme Court Violated Banking Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
says the Swiss Supreme Court violated that country's laws by
allowing investigators to examine his bank accounts.
   The court announced Saturday that it had ordered Credit Suisse
to open the records to Swiss investigators, despite objections
raised by the bank.
   The Philippine government of President Corazon Aquino had asked
Switzerland for help in locating an estimated $1 billion Marcos
allegedly deposited in Swiss banks.
   According to a statement released Sunday night by Marcos
spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, Swiss authorities told the Aquino
government last year that, under Swiss law, criminal charges would
have to be filed against Marcos in the Philippines before his bank
accounts could be investigated.
   The Philippine Supreme Court recently certified that no criminal
charges have been filed against Marcos in any Philippine court,
Trinidad said.
   ``The news that the Swiss Supreme Count announced that it has
authorized a bank to allow investigators to examine bank account
records is definitely contrary to Swiss laws governing bank
deposits,'' Trinidad said.
   The court's ruling does not affect a freeze that has been placed
on Marcos' accounts, Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler
said in Lausanne.
   Marcos has lived here since he fled the Philippines in 1986.

<HEAD>Court Gives States Power to Enforce Safety Codes at Nuclear
Facilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave states some power
to enforce safety codes at federal nuclear production facilities
for hazards unrelated to radiation.
   The court, in a 6-2 ruling, said a worker injured falling from a
scaffold at a nuclear plant in Ohio is entitled to seek a ``bonus''
compensation award.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said federal
law does not prohibit states from indirectly enforcing safety
regulations at federal facilities by awarding supplemental workers'
compensation for code violations.
   ``Congress' reluctance to allow direct state regulation of
federal projects (does not bar) incidental regulatory effects
arising from the enforcement of a workers' compensation law, like
Ohio's, that provides an additional award when the injury is caused
by the breach of a safety regulation,'' Marshall said.
   The court ruled against Goodyear Atomic Corp., which operates
the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant near Piketon, Ohio.
   The federally owned plant enriches and refines nuclear fuel used
for civililan energy and for weapons and Navy submarines and ships.
   Esto R. Miller, a mechanic, was injured on July 30, 1980, when
his glove caught on a bolt protruding from the mobile scaffold on
which he was working. Miller was pulled from the platform and broke
his ankle falling to the ground some six feet below.
   Miller was awarded $9,000 in workmen's compensation. He sought
an additional award of between $1,328 and $4,429 fgrom Goodyear
Atomic because, he said, the scaffold was defective and violated
Ohio safety regulations.
   The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that Miller is entitled to
seek the additional compensation.
   Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor, in a dissenting
opinion written by White, said Congress did not intend to expose
federal facilities to such state regulation.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the ruling.
   The case is Goodyear Atomic vs. Miller, 86-1172.

   A 30-year-old man faces charges for creating a disturbance by
bringing a 1,300-pound ox into a bar.
   Joseph Main apparently was upset over being asked to leave the
bar Friday night and brought the animal in the next night as a

   He was arrested Sunday and charged with disturbing the peace,
reckless endangerment, breach of peace, interfering with a police
officer and cruelty to animals.
   Main brought an ox through the front door and into the barroom
of Gary's Restaurant on Route 49 about 10 p.m. Saturday, state
police said.
   The ox stood in the bar and disturbed people who were eating,
according to police who said Main was asked several times to remove
the animal.
   Main led the ox from the bar after state troopers arrived, tied
the animal to his truck, then ran off, police said.
   Main was arrested at his home and was scheduled to appear in New
London Superior Court June 2.
   Two other people were charged with conspiracy for allegedly
helping Main bring the ox into the bar.

   Two senators and an 11-member coalition of
health groups called today for increased spending on disorders that
afflict senior citizens, saying the money will be needed to cope
with ``the largest senior boom in history.''
   The Task Force for Aging Research Funding recommended that the
nation spend $340 million above current levels on research into
strokes, Alzheimer's disease and other afflictions. The figure is
$278 million higher than what President Reagan has requested for
fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   ``We won't be able to accomplish this budget, but we ought to
push for it,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican
on the Senate Budget Committee. ``It's very practical. It's an
absolute must when you look at the demographics and the cost'' of
health care.
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, said senior citizens groups are leading the
push for the additional spending, but ``it's for the benefit of
those to follow'' since the research won't bear fruit for 10 to 20
years.
   Daniel Perry, executive director of the nonpartisan Alliance for
Aging Research, said one-third of the $450 billion spent annually
on health care is on the 12 percent of the population over 65.
   With no medical breakthroughs, Perry said, by the middle of the
next century there will be three times more hip fractures, four
times as much demand for nursing home beds and eight times as many
cases of dementia as in 1980.
   ``Our goal is not simply a longer life span but a longer
health-span,'' he said.
   In its report, the task force says less than 0.5 percent of the
$146 billion spent annually on health care for those over 65 goes
for research to prevent and treat age-related problems. ``This
represents a poor investment strategy for a nation soon to
experience the largest senior boom in history,'' the report said.
   The number of Americans over 85, currently 2.7 million, is
expected to double by the end of the century and quadruple in the
next 60 years, the task force said.
   ``We can tinker with changes in the health care delivery system
which can produce some savings ... but these savings will not equal
the long-term benefits of dramatic medical and scientific changes
that will alter the way we experience old age,'' the report said.
   The task force called for a national focus on research to help
lower medical expenses and improve the health of older Americans,
including higher investments in basic research and research
targeted at specific diseases such as Alzheimer's; faster clinical
trials; greater support and training for geriatric medicine; and
further study of the psychological, behavioral and sociological
aspects of aging.
   The agencies receiving budget increases under the task force
proposal would be the National Institute on Aging; the National
Institute of Mental Health; the National Institute of Neurological
and Communicative Disorders and Stroke; the National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; and the Veterans
Administration.
   Members of the task force are the Alliance for Aging Research;
the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association; the
American Cancer Society; the American Diabetes Association; the
American Geriatrics Society; the American Heart Association; the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Immunology and Aging; the
National Committee for Research in Neurological and Communicative
Disorders; the National Foundation for Long Term Health Care; the
National Osteoporosis Foundation; and Paralyzed Veterans of America.

<TEXT>
   Daniel Patrick Moynihan today announced
his candidacy for a third term in the U.S. Senate, saying the
welfare of young Americans and fighting drugs will be among his
chief concerns.
   ``The issue of drugs is a tormenting one in this country now. I
have been, and will continue to be seized with the issue of drug
abuse,'' the New York Democrat said after announcing his candidacy
outside a Syracuse office building.
   He also said long-term health care for the elderly and
rebuilding the nation's transportation system would be among the
top concerns of a third term.
   The senator called it ``a personal tragedy and a national shame
that we require millions of seniors to become paupers before their
medical costs are covered.''
   Moynihan, 61, was scheduled to repeat his announcement this
afternoon at the Manhattan Center of Mathematics and Science and
attend a fund-raising rally in New York City.
   The senator cited his longstanding efforts in the battle against
drugs in response to the charge made by his likely Republican
opponent, Long Island attorney Robert McMillan, that Moynihan was
soft on drugs.
   Moynihan noted that as President John Kennedy's assistant for
urban affairs he conceived the strategy that broke the notorious
``French Connection'' of heroin traffic flowing into the United
States from Turkey via France.
   ``If anybody has that record, please come forward and tell us
about it,'' said Moynihan, who is co-chairman of the Senate's
Democratic Task Force on Substance Abuse. ``I saw the job through.
I mean to see this one through as well.''
   McMillan, 55, has not yet officially announced his candidacy but
has been lining up the support of GOP leaders behind a probable run.
   Moynihan defeated former state Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan
of Brooklyn by more than 1.5 million votes in 1982, the largest
margin in a U.S. Senate election in New York state history. He won
the seat in 1976 by defeating Republican incumbent James Buckley.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
overturning the adoption by a Mississippi couple of Choctaw Indian
twins.
   The justices said they will hear arguments by tribal leaders
that state courts lacked the authority to grant the adoption.
   The children, a boy and a girl, were born Dec. 29, 1985, in
Philadelphia, Miss., near the Choctaw reservation. Their mother,
Jennie Bell, and their father, Windell Jefferson, are members of
the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.
   The twins were put up for adoption by their parents, and were
adopted by Orrey and Vivian Holyfield.
   A Mississippi judge, noting that Ms. Bell had traveled off the
reservation to give birth, said the Choctaw tribe therefore ``never
obtained exclusive jurisdiction over the children.'' The
Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the adoption.
   Choctaw leaders said the ruling unlawfully violates the tribe's
sovereignty over its own legal affairs.
   They also said the decision could encourage illegal adoption of
Choctaw babies by making Mississippi ``a potential adoption Mecca
for, among others, black marketeers trading in Indian children.''
   The case is In the Matter of B.B. and G.B. vs. Holyfield, 87-980.

   Japan today bestowed the Grand Cordon of the Order
of the Rising Sun on former U.S. Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger for his contribution to Japan's defense, the Foreign
Ministry said.
   A ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno praised Weinberger for his contribution
to strengthened security between Japan and the United States.
   The decoration is a high award usually given by Japan to foreign
heads of state. Uno presented the award to Weinberger.
   The official quoted Weinberger as saying he tried while in
office not to link U.S.-Japan defense issues with trade disputes
stemming from the restrictions of Japan's markets. Defense is much
more important than trade, the official reported Weinberger as
saying.
   Weinberger was defense secretary for seven years before retiring
last November. He arrived Saturday in Tokyo for a four-day visit at
the invitation of the Foreign Ministry.
   It was the second foreign award given to Weinberger in four
months. On Feb. 23 in London, Queen Elizabeth II declared
Weinberger an honorary knight.
   Before meeting with Uno, Weinberger met separately with Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita and the director general of defense
agency, Tsutomu Kawara, the Foreign Ministry official said. He said
details of the talks were not available.
   But Kyodo News Service reported that Weinberger gave Takeshita a
message from President Reagan saying Reagan was looking forward to
seeing the Japanese prime minister next month when the two leaders
will visit London.
   Takeshita told Weinberger he will try to discuss Japan's imports
of U.S. beef and oranges with Reagan, Kyodo said.
   Takeshita is to stop in London after attending the U.N. General
Assembly on June 1.

<HEAD>Town Begins Two-Year Health Study Aimed At Cutting Heart Disease</HEAD>

Picks up in 4th graf pvs, `The program ...'</NOTE>

   Residents of this town pledged today to
whittle their waistlines and cut cholesterol as part of a two-year,
$4 million study aimed at reducing heart disease among rural
Americans.
   ``This town is looking healthier already,'' said Mayor Anthony
Cipriani during a ceremony marking the start of the fitness study.
``I predict that in two years we will be living longer, healthier
lives.''
   After Cipriani's remarks, residents released thousands of red,
white and blue heart-shaped balloons into threatening skies. A card
signed by residents who promised to adopt a healthier lifestyle was
attached to each balloon.
   ``I hope to quit smoking, I've been trying for 20 years,'' said
Esther Taylor, 40, one of those attending the ceremony. ``Our
eating habits are really bad, too, too much junk food and meat and
eggs.''
   The program, one of the first privately funded public health
education programs for rural areas, is sponsored by The Bayer Co.
and Glenbrook Laboratories, the aspirin maker's New York-based
parent.
   Signs of a fitness frenzy are evident throughout the Ohio River
town. Exercise bicycles, tennis rackets and baseball gloves have
replaced dresses and men's clothing in the windows of some shops.
   And a sign at Wade's Barbershop advertised free ``rest facials''
today guaranteed to ``cleanse the skin, increase circulation,
activate glandular activity and correct certain skin disorders.''
   Some of the 1,000 volunteers in the study sampled low-calorie
snacks and had their weight and blood pressure checked Sunday
during a health fair that attracted most of the town's 4,000
residents.
   ``I'm looking forward to it, especially because of my husband's
high cholesterol,'' said Donna Lyons, one of those in the study.
``Right now, I'm smoking. But hopefully I can break that habit with
the help of the program and begin exercising regularly, too.''
   Organizers said they chose Wellsburg, about 45 miles southwest
of Pittsburgh, because of its small population. Also, West Virginia
registered the highest obesity rate in the country at 24 percent in
a 1986 federal study that found 31 percent of West Virginians smoke
cigarettes.
   The state is second only to Iowa in the annual death rate from
heart disease, said Dr. David Heydinger, West Virginia's health
director.
   Bayer hopes a fitter Wellsburg will be a model for other small
towns.
   Robin Mills, president of The Bayer Co., and actor John
Forsythe, who portrays Blake Carrington in television's
``Dynasty,'' joined Cipriani in Sunday's one-mile trek around the
town square.
   ``There's nothing symbolic about this,'' Forsythe said as he
stepped out in a quick stride to the strains of ``When The Saints
Go Marching In'' played by the dozen elderly women who make up the
Rambling Rose Kazoo Band.
   ``I just want people to hear the facts from a guy who actually
went through it.''
   The 70-year-old actor underwent heart bypass surgery in 1979 and
now follows a strict diet that includes fish, chicken and low-fat
foods, but no red meat.
   ``The enthusiasm has been building all week,'' said Brian
Morris, coordinator of the ``wellness program.'' ``We have more
than 200 people on a wait-list who will take the place of anyone
dropping out before the study is completed.''
   Initial testing for the program ended today, and results of
comprehensive health exams that checked for high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors
were tallied.
   The tests will be repeated every three months during the study.
   Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United
States, accounting for more deaths annually than all other causes
combined, according to the American Heart Association.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with location of Days' relatives, spokesman's
comments about gun smuggling and belief that child is Mrs. Day's
daughter</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHILLICOTHE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities continued their search
today for an armed escapee who took two guards hostage in a prison
Jeep before leaving them at a hotel and fleeing with his wife and a
child in a getaway car, officials said.
   Michael Day, 31, of Athens, escaped Sunday night from the
medium-security Ross Correctional Institution, said prison
spokesman Robert Prosser.
   ``At this point we have an all-points bulletin out throughout
Ohio and in surrounding states,'' Prosser said early today.
   Prosser said Day has relatives in the Cincinnati area and his
wife has relatives in Indiana.
   Day was serving a sentence of 18-to-55 years in the prison,
about 50 miles south of Columbus, for burglary and other felonies.
He was believed to be armed with a .25-caliber weapon, said Todd
Bennett of the State Highway Patrol.
   Prosser said Day took the guards hostage shortly after 7 p.m.
with a gun apparently smuggled into the prison, Prosser said.
   ``That's how he got through the prison security,'' Prosser said.
   A .38-caliber revolver that was kept in the Jeep was discarded
near the prison after the escape, Prosser said. A shotgun also kept
in the vehicle was recovered.
   Day took the guards, whose names were not released, to the
Holiday Inn near downtown, Prosser said.
   Day handcuffed one guard to the Jeep steering wheel and took the
other into a room registered in the name of Day's 27-year-old wife,
Sylvia Caraveo Day, said Prosser. Day told the guard to handcuff
himself to a towel bar.
   Prosser said that guard freed himself after Day and his wife
left the hotel. The guard went to the window and saw the two get
into a car.
   The couple, who Prosser said married while Day was in prison,
had a 9-year-old child with them, but officials weren't sure if the
child was related to the fugitives. Prosser said authorities were
acting on the assumption the child was Mrs. Day's daughter.
   Authorities found the getaway car behind a restaurant near U.S.
23 and U.S. 35 on the city's east side, Prosser said.
   The highway patrol said Mrs. Day had checked in at the hotel
Saturday.
   Day was convicted of attempted abduction, burglary, receiving
stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon, said Sandy Price,
a prison spokeswoman. He had been at the Ross prison since June and
had served at the Chillicothe Correctional Institute and Ohio State
Reformatory in Mansfield since April 1985.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Consider Reinstating Massachusetts
Child-Pornography Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating a Massachusetts child-pornography law a state court
said could be used to prosecute parents who photograph their naked,
infant children on the beach.
   The justices voted to review a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court ruling, reached by a 4-3 vote, that the state law too broadly
interferes with a form of expression.
   The state court ruling overturned the criminal conviction in
Worcester County of Douglas Oakes for ``soliciting a child to pose
for pornographic purposes.''
   Prosecutors said Oakes in 1984 induced his 14-year-old
stepdaughter to pose for photographs while clothed only in bikini
underpants and with a scarf draped around her neck.
   Police were contacted after the girl's mother discovered the
photographs.
   When Oakes appealed, the state's highest court threw out his
conviction and dismissed the criminal indictment.
   The state court's 4-3 majority said photography is a form of
expression with which the state may interfere only when the
interference serves an important governmental purpose and is
narrowly drawn to serve that purpose.
   Looking at the state law involved, the state court said, ``The
overbreadth is substantial. It criminalizes conduct that virtually
every person would regard as lawful.''
   ``For example,'' the state court added, ``(the law) makes a
criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his or her
naked one-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.''
   The state court's three dissenters said taking photographs is
not a form of expression and the ``narrowly drawn'' test
traditionally used in free-speech cases should not have been used.
   In the appeal acted on today, Massachusetts Attorney General
James M. Shannon said a 1982 Supreme Court decision excluding child
pornography from free-speech protections ``established that states
are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic
depictions of children than might be appropriate in other
contexts.''
   The case is Massachusetts vs. Oakes, 87-1651.

<HEAD>Court Gives Trial Judges Power Sometimes to Deny Defendants Lawyer
of Choice</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 18-20, Agreed to consider, with other case.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave trial judges
broad power to deny criminal defendants the lawyer of their choice
if a possible conflict of interest exists.
   The court also ruled that judges may veto a defendant's choice
of lawyers even when the defendant is willing to waive the right to
conflict-free legal help.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld the 1984
narcotics-trafficking conspiracy conviction of Mark Wheat, who
received and stored large shipments of Mexican marijuana at his
Escondido, Calif., home and then distributed the illegal drug to
local customers.
   Wheat, one of 23 people charged in the conspiracy, had
challenged the conviction on grounds that he wrongly was denied the
defense lawyer of his choice.
   Wheat had sought to have lawyer Eugene Iredale join another
attorney in representing him. But the presiding judge rejected
Wheat's request because Iredale already represented two other
accused conspirators who possibly would have been called to testify
against Wheat.
   Wheat had argued that the mere possibility of a conflict of
interest for a defense lawyer cannot suffice to veto a defendant's
choice of lawyers, especially when the defendant is willing to
waive any right to conflict-free representation.
   But writing for the court today, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said a defendant's waiver cannot cure the problems caused
by one lawyer representing more than one defendant in the samg he
inter-4v interest in the rendition of just verdicts in criminal
cases may be jeopardized by unregulated multiple representation,''
he said.
   Rehnquist said trial judges ``must recognize a presumption in
favor of a (defendant's) counsel of choice'' but he said that
presumption ``may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual
conflict but by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.''
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan, John Paul
Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun voted to overturn Wheat's conviction.
   Writing for himself and Brennan, Marshall said, ``I believe that
the potential for a conflict of interest in this case did not
overcome (Wheat's) right to choose his own counsel.''
   Writing for himself and Blackmun, Stevens said Wheat should have
been allowed ``additional counsel of his choice'' because he still
would have had legal representation if an actual conflict developed.
   ``In this case, it is abundantly clear to me that the district
judge abused his discretion and deprived (Wheat) of a
constitutional right of such fundamental character that reversal is
required,'' Stevens said.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to consider reinstating a Massachusetts
child-pornography law a state court said could be used to prosecute
parents who photograph their naked, infant children on the beach.
   The justices voted to review a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court ruling, reached by a 4-3 vote, that the state law too broadly
interferes with a form of expression.
   _ Gave states some power to enforce safety codes at federal
nuclear producti on facilities for hazards unrelated to radiation.
   The court, in a 6-2 ruling, said a worker injured falling from a
scaffold at a nuclear plant in Ohio is entitled to seek a ``bonus''
compensation award.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said federal
law does not prohibit states from indirectly enforcing safety
regulations at federal fcilities by awarding supplemental workers'
compensation for code violations.
   _ Let stand a ruling that millions of so-called fixed annuities
are subject to federal securities law.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that fixed
annuities paying fluctuating interest rates may be regulated the
same as stocks and bonds.
   _ Let stand a $100,000 libel award won against a Richmond, Va.,
newspaper and one of its reporters by a high school teacher in that
city.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear the Richmond
Times-Dispatch's challenge of the judgment won by Vernelle
Lipscomb, a longtime English teacher in Richmond's public schools.
   _ Refused to unravel a merger between Eastman Kodak Co. and
Fuqua Industries that created the nation's largest wholesale
photofinishing operation.
   The court, without comment, rejected a competitor's arguments
that the deal violates antitrust laws.
   _ Turned away an appeal by six men convicted as members of the
Colombo crime family in New York City and one of their associates.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the rights
of crime syndicate boss Carmine Persico and six others were not
violated in the government's racketeering prosecution.
   _ Agreed to consider overturning the adoption by a Mississippi
couple of Choctaw Indian twins.
   The justices said they will hear arguments by tribal leaders
that state courts lacked the authority to grant the adoption.
   The counsel case is Wheat vs. U.S., 87-4.

   A four-term congressman announced today
that he will seek the Republican nomination for governor, setting
the stage for a race in which the stalled Seabrook nuclear plant is
likely to figure prominently.
   Rep. Judd Gregg said he would bring to the Statehouse a record
of ``fiscal restraint and common sense, a record of commitment to
low taxation and an understanding of the basic values of New
Hampshire.''
   Manchester Mayor Robert Shaw also is seeking the GOP nomination.
   Republican Gov. John Sununu announced a week ago he will not
seek a fourth two-year term.
   Gregg, a 41-year-old lawyer, said he favors allowing Seabrook to
go into operation provided it meets certain conditions, including
having a ``safe, workable evacuation plan.''
   He also said the plant's cost should be shared by consumers,
investors and debtholders.
   Shaw, 53, today called Seabrook ``a monumental disaster,'' and
said he will fight to have it converted to natural gas.
   ``Already, that incredibly expensive and politically mismanaged
project has bankrupted the state's largest utility. Now it
threatens to impoverish the rest of us as well,'' Shaw said.
   Seabrook has yet to go into operation because of emergency
evacuation obstacles, a delay that forced its lead owner, Public
Service Company of New Hampshire, to seek bankruptcy protection
last year.
   Portsmouth lawyer Paul McEachern has announced for the
Democratic nomination. McEachern, a leading opponent of Seabrook,
lost to Sununu in 1986.

   President Reagan has sent an emissary back to
Panama for more talks aimed at the removal from power of ruler
Manuel Antonio Noriega, and the administration wants the issue
cleared up before the Moscow summit, an official said today.
   ``It would be desirable to clear it up while the president's on
our own soil,'' said Michael Armacost, undersecretary of state.
   Reagan leaves Washington on Wednesday for a stopover in
Helsinki, Finland, before arriving in Moscow on Sunday.
   The president, at a ceremony in the Rose Garden dealing with
world trade, was asked if there would be an agreement with Noriega
before Wednesday. ``We're not going by time; we're going by
quality,'' Reagan said.
   hp~=\@@O=~_^4|_greater than__@__^
rafficking indictments against the Panamanian general, Reagan said,
``Nothing's been settled. It's still in the works.''
   Michael G. Kozak, the State Department's deputy assistant
secretary, returned to Panama after briefing Reagan and other top
officials over the weekend on negotiations for Noriega's removal.
Kozak had spent virtually all of May in Panama trying to work out
an agreement.
   Armacost said that Kozak ``wasn't going down with an ultimatum''
and that it was uncertain whether the negotiations would be
resolved before the summit.
   ``Kozak is back down there and I don't expect that the
president's going to want to spend his time in Moscow talking to
Mr. (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev about Noriega,'' Armacost said. He said
negotiations with the Panamanian leader were proceeding.
   Kozak's latest trip comes amid uncertainty about the
administration's strategy in dealing with Noriega.
   Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the national security adviser, said
Sunday that Reagan was undecided on approval of a deal for Noriega
to step down. Powell said the United States has put the plan ``on
the table.''
   The proposal calls for the United States to continue recognizing
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle as Panama's legitimate leader
rather than Noriega's handpicked choice and the current president,
Manuel Solis Palma, Powell said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, interviewed on ABC-TV's
``This Week With David Brinkley,'' also denied reports that the
Reagan administration had agreed to recognize Palma as part of the
deal for Noriega to step down.
   ``No, I don't know where you get that understanding. There's
nothing to that,'' Shultz said.
   The secretary also said the United States ``has had a lot of
discussions'' with Noriega, ``but we haven't concluded any
agreement.''
   Powell, who attended a 2{-hour session at the White House on
Saturday with Reagan, Shultz and other senior advisers, said
U.S.-Panamanian negotiations are ``on hold,'' but the
administration has proposed a deal.
   ``It's on the table. All the elements have not yet come
together, the president has not yet made a decision,'' Powell said.
   ``The president has agreed for the deal to be put on the table,
but it has not gone to closure,'' he said.
   Powell said Reagan has not yet decided on the deal because
``dropping an indictment of this nature is a very serious matter.''
   An administration official, who requested anonymity, said Friday
that U.S. and Panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a
deal that calls for Noriega to leave Panama for nine months
starting this August and for the United States to drop drug
smuggling indictments against him.
   The official said the deal would give Noriega a role in setting
up a transition government before leaving, and also would allow
Noriega to return to Panama for holidays and to go back permanently
after elections set for May 1989.
   Powell said the plan, which has not changed significantly in
recent weeks, calls for Noriega to step down from power as
commander of the Panamanian defense forces and allow free elections
in May 1989.
   ``Over the last several months, we have been able to put
together a deal if you would, a set of negotiations, which would
require General Noriega to step down from power. He would then
leave the country for a period of time,'' Powell said.
   After Noriega steps down, the United States ``would continue to
recognize President Delvalle and Palma would work _ we would hope _
with President Delvalle and other opposition leaders to form a
government of national reconciliation,'' he said.
   The national security adviser said the deal's elements ``that
are on the table would remove him from the political process and he
would not be a candidate for election in 1989.''
   Both Powell and Shultz defended the proposed deal, saying that
dropping the indictments against Noriega is a defensible bargaining
position because he cannot be extradited so long as he remains in
Panama.
   ``The indictments that were handed down are indictments that
would be very difficult to follow up on,'' Powell said.
   ``We have no ability to extradite him from Panama,'' Shultz
said. ``So you ask yourself which situation are we better off in _
to have Noriega more or less in charge in Panama and us with an
indictment that we can't do much about but nevertheless holding on
to it, or having Noriega give up power in Panama and leaving
Panama, but also having paid that penalty?''

<TEXT>
   ``Kiss-and-tell'' books by former White
House staff members Donald Regan and Larry Speakes should not have
been published until President Reagan left office, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater says.
   ``There are legitimate, historical reasons for writing a book
after serving in the White House,'' Fitzwater said Sunday in
Abilene, where he spoke at commencement at his old high school.
``But there is no reason to trash the president and your
colleagues.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan is very upset about what the authors wrote
about his wife.
   ``It's hardly fair to say we have astrology in the White
House,'' he said of the book by Regan, former White House chief of
staff. Regan wrote that Mrs. Reagan made decisions based on regular
conversations with an astrologer.
   ``It's an interesting story, but I don't think the public or the
media are taking it too seriously,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater refused to comment about Speakes, his former boss at
the White House. ``He's paid the price by losing his job and having
his reputation damaged. I see no reason to add to that,'' he added.
   Fitzwater said he might write a book about his time in the White
House _ but not while Reagan is in office. ``If I do, it will not
be like Regan's or Speakes','' he said.
   Fitzwater graduated from Abilene High School in 1960.

<HEAD>Justices Broaden Study of Claimed Deductions</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today expanded its study of
whether payments made to the Church of Scientology by its members
may be claimed as federal income tax deductions.
   The justices, who last month agreed to review the issue, today
added one case to its study _ the test case used by the U.S. Tax
Court in 1984. A Supreme Court decision is expected sometime next
year.
   Scientologists make payments called ``fixed donations'' to the
church.
   The Internal Revenue Service says such payments for ``auditing''
and training sessions are not charitable contributions that can be
counted as tax deductions.
   Scientologists say the IRS has singled out their church for
unfair treatment and is interfering with their religious freedom.
   Federal law allows taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by
declaring various deductions, including money or things of value
given to charities or religious organizations. But such a payment
is not tax-deductible if something of value is received in return.
   A practice within the Church of Scientology is a process known
as auditing, in which members are expected to reach a higher level
of spiritual awareness. Auditing is administered in a one-to-one
session in which the church member's skin responses to questions
are measured by an electronic device.
   Each branch of the church charges a ``fixed donation'' for
training and auditing sessions, and almost never waives the payment
requirement.
   The Tax Court ruled that the fixed donations required by the
church are not tax-deductible contributions but instead are
non-deductible payments made for services.
   That ruling was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in a case involving Church of Scientology members Katherine Jean
Graham of Honolulu, Richard M. Hermann of Los Angeles and David F.
Maynard of Rialto, Calif.
   The high court today said it will use the appeal of those three
individuals to help it resolve conflicting rulings on the tax issue
by federal appeals courts.
   The case is Graham vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 87-1616.

<HEAD>Caribbean Leader: Panama Should Solve Problems Without Outside
Interference</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The 13-member Caribbean Community
says Panama has a right to solve its economic and political crises
without outside interference, Foreign Minister Sahadeo Basdeo said
today.
   ``(It would be) contradictory to the principles of the Caricom
states for them to dictate to Gen. Manuel (Antonio) Noreiga what he
should do in his native Panama,'' said Basdeo, chairman of
Caricom's foreign affairs committee.
   Noriega, head of Panama's Defense Force and the power behind
Panama's civilian government, was indicted in February on drug
trafficking charges in Florida and has been under intense pressure
from the United States to step down from power.
   Basdeo's comments echoed a statement by Caricom foreign
ministers in a weekend meeting in Trinidad and Tobago.
   ``The ministers discussed the recent developments in Panama and
reaffirmed the sovereign right of the Panamanian people to
determine their own destiny free from external pressures,'' the
ministers said in a statement.
   The one-paragraph statement was contained in a 10-page
communique on international relations issued Sunday after the
two-day meeting.
   The United States recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as Panama's
leader. Delvalle was replaced as president in February one day
after he ordered Noriega to step down.

   An American Airlines DC-10 lay crippled
near a Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport hangar today after
beif the boggy field where it slid ng dragged out onose-down during
an aborted takeoff.
   Workers took several hours to haul the huge jet from the mud
where it had been stuck since Saturday.
   ``It's a slow, tedious process,'' another airline spokesman,
John Hotard,  Patrick said he expects the rules will
end the ``reign of reruns'' on TV, and, by giving broadcasters a
measure of protection, will heighten the value of the programs to
advertisers. More ad revenue, in turn, will foster production of
new programs, he said.
   ``The big winners today are consumers. They will benefit by a
smooth transition to a fairer and more competitive market structure
which promises richer and more diverse programming,'' Patrick said.
   It is unlikely cable systems will have ort-term political advantage,
which I cannot believe
they will do,'' he said.
   Broadcasters have been pushing the FCC to reimpose exclusivity
rules and were happy with the final product, but the National Cable
Television Association said the action ``pulled the plug on the
favorite TV programs of millions of people.''
   NCTA President James Mooney predicted that ``people whose
favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered,'' and
the costs of syndicated programming will go up.
   The rules are similar to ones the FCC dropped in 1980. Since
then, cable systems have been able to carry the signals of
out-of-town stations such as WTBS in Atlanta, WWOR in the New York
area and WGN in Chicago, which have become known as superstations,
even when those stations transmit programs whose rights were bought
by a local TV station.
   Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting Inc., which owns
WTBS, said in a statement the new rules ``do not give the cable
industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts.''
   Turner held out the possibility of a court appeal, but said that
decision would be made after the FCC issues its written rules.
   Jeff Treeman, senior vice president of United Video, the Tulsa,
Okla.-based cable carrier that distributes superstation signals,
including WGN, said cable systems in some large markets, where
independents can afford to buy exclusive rights to programming, may
have to black out or substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of
a superstation's programming.
   ``That's enough for the cable operator to drop the signal,'' he
said.
   Under the new syndicated programming exclusivity rules, TV
stations will be able to negotiate for exclusive rights to a
syndicated program and will be able to force a cable system to
honor that contract. The rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate
rights with cable systems.
   Superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for
syndicated shows on a nationwide basis, under the rules.
   Patrick said the new rules won't go into effect for one year, to
give cable systems time to prepare.
   The rules won't apply to cable systems with fewer than 1,000
subscribers. About half of all cable systems fall into this
category, though they serve only about 5 percent of the nation's 45
million cable subscribers, the FCC said.
   ``You will see more diversity in programs,'' said Edward O.
Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters,
though he added that rules will likely drive up the cost of
syndicated programming.

<HEAD>Congress' Sudden Hot Issue: Home Health Care for Everyone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public concern over the cost of longterm
illnesses has become the driving force behind Rep. Claude Pepper's
determined campaign to force Congress to vote on his plan to expand
Medicare _ and Medicare taxes _ to cover the expenses of home
health care.
   With polls claiming enormous support for a government program to
address those concerns, longterm-care proposals are proliferating
on Capitol Hill.
   ``This issue is one that voters will carry into the ballot
box,'' said Bruce Fried, executive director of the National Health
Care Campaign, a coalition of 100 organizations with affiliates in
35 states.
   ``Virtually every family stands at risk of needing longterm home
care at any time, and none of us are protected very well against
that eventuality,'' Fried said. ``It cuts across age lines, it cuts
across economic lines, it cuts across whether people view
themselves as liberals or conservatives. This is what the
population wants.''
   Pepper's five-year, $30 billion proposal would expand Medicare
to pay for various home care services for the chronically ill of
all ages. It would be financed by subjecting all income to the 1.45
percent Medicare payroll tax; currently only income up to $45,000
is taxed. No deductible or co-payment requirement would be imposed.
   Business interests are critical, partly because they would have
to match the additional Medicare tax payments. And budget watchdogs
predict the financing mechanism will prove inadequate, leading to
higher deficits or costly premiums and co-payments.
   The plan advanced by Pepper, D-Fla., is encountering a lot of
competition.
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, has proposed what is likely to be the
House Republican alternative: a $25 million, 30-month demonstration
program in five geographically diverse sites. Medicare would pay 80
percent of home-care costs after a $500 deductible is met.
   In the Senate, George Mitchell, D-Maine, chairman of the Finance
subcommittee on health, has offered a plan of his own. Medicare
would pay up to $2,000 for respite care; 80 percent of the cost of
home health care after a $500 deductible is met; and 70 percent of
nursing home costs after a two-year exclusionary period.
   And Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., plans to introduce an $18.6
billion Medicare expansion called ``Lifecare.'' The program would
pay for home care services and six months of nursing home care with
no co-payments or deductibles, and 35 percent of subsequent nursing
home care, minus the cost of room and board.
   But Pepper's bill is the only one heading for quick action,
probably early next month, for several reasons: He is chairman of
the powerful Rules Committee; at 87, the oldest House member, he is
revered by senior citizens across the country as their advocate and
he has campaigned for many of his colleagues.
   ``I'm trying to cooperate ... provided they don't make us wait
too long'' for a vote, Pepper said last week. ``We're getting
almost to the edge of our endurance.''
   Initially, Pepper planned to offer his bill as an amendment to a
catastrophic health plan designed to help the elderly deal with the
heavy cost of acute illness. But House leaders feared that tactic
would sink the whole bill.
   Pepper withheld his proposal in return for Speaker Jim Wright's
promise of a House floor vote on it. Ordinarily, the bill would
have gone to the Ways and Means Committee, but Pepper sped the bill
out of his Rules Committee last November and has been waiting ever
since.
   Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., doen't hide
his distaste for Pepper's bill. He contends it is too expensive and
technically flawed and should go through his committee for review.
   There is little doubt, given the political climate, that
Pepper's bill will win House passage. In the Senate, Mitchell said,
``We'll do the best we can as fast as we can. Maybe it'll be this
year, maybe it'll be next year. We don't have to have a deadline.''
   Those who work closely with Pepper say it is a mistake to count
him out this year.
   Kathy Gardner, staff director of a health subcommittee chaired
by Pepper, noted that half the members of the Senate Finance
Committee are up for re-election and longterm care is a staple on
the campaign trail this year. She said a similar atmosphere existed
two years ago when Pepper pushed through a bill outlawing mandatory
retirement.

   While the superpowers strive to put into force
the treaty banning medium-range missiles, senior U.S. and Soviet
scientists have been getting together for confidential talks to
discuss future arms control issues and ways to avoid nuclear war.
   Thetalks, taking place through two committees operating under
the aegis of the National Academy of Sciences, have been described
by American participants as surprisingly frank and productive.
   One group, the Committee on International Security and Arms
Control, known as CISAC, recently completed a three-day closed-door
meeting with leading Soviet academicians headed by Roald Sagdeyev,
director of Moscow's Space Research Institute.
   Chairing the 17-member U.S. panel is Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky,
former director of Stanford University's Linear Accelerator Center.
   The latest meeting _ the 12th in a series of confidential
sessions that CISAC has held with Soviet counterparts since 1981 _
took place May 4-6 at a conference center in Queenstown, Md., about
60 miles east of Washington.
   The tone of the meeting was ``very constructive and very
friendly,'' said John D. Steinbruner, a committee member and
director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a
liberal Washington think tank. ``It's a very pragmatic, congenial
working atmosphere.''
   ``We discussed strategic force reduction, issues of verification
and conventional force questions that have to do with the mainline
items of arms control,'' he said. ``Our ground rules are that we do
not, however, discuss directly the negotiations that are under
way.''
   Steinbruner said the main verification issue that came under
discussion dealt with cruise missiles, which pose special problems
because they are relatively small and easily concealed.
   He said that over the past seven years, ``there's no question
but that we have seen in the course of these meetings very
extensive development in the thinking of people on the Soviet side
who are in touch with high-level officials in the leadership. ...
It's pretty encouraging.''
   Another CISAC member, Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., president of the
Washington-based Arms Control Association, said ``one not only
gains insight into Soviet positions but also informs influential
Soviet scientists about U.S. thinking on these issues.''
   Other Americans currently serving on the committee include
Joshua Lederberg, president of Rockefeller University; Charles H.
Townes, a physics professor at the University of California,
Berkeley, and former White House science adviser Jerome B. Wiesner,
a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   A second group operating under the sponsorship of the National
Academy of Sciences is the Committee on Contributions of Behavioral
and Social Science to the Prevention of Nuclear War.
   This 20-member panel, formed in 1985, has been looking beyond
the strategic and technical aspects of nuclear war to consider
questions such as how superpower leaders interpret each other's
actions and under what conditions they might resort to nuclear
weapons.
   William K. Estes, co-chairman of the committee and a psychology
professor at Harvard University, said the group is starting to
develop a joint U.S.-Soviet project involving public opinion
research in the two countries.
   He said that during two working trips to the Soviet Union last
year, he was impressed by the change of mood under Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Among academicians, which is my immediate concern, it's just a
tremendous uplift,'' Estes said. ``For some _ for example,
sociologists whose field is public opinion research _ just a total
liberation. They can come out of the bushes for the first time in
their memories.''
   Panel co-chairman Herbert A. Simon, a Nobel laureate in
economics at Carnegie-Mellon University, said he had been ``rather
pleasurably surprised'' with the rapid pace at which the group has
been able to develop contacts with Soviet social scientists.
   Simon said he too was encouraged by the Soviet leadership's
increasing sensitivity to sounding out and analyzing public
attitudes on U.S.-Soviet relations and arms control.
   ``The whole idea behind this committee is that a sane and
informed world _ a world in which people understand better how they
themselves and other people behave _ has a chance of being a little
better world than a world in which we fly by the seat of our
pants,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dino Grandi, Fascist Who Opposed Mussolini, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dino Grandi, who lost out to Benito Mussolini in a
1921 bid for leadership of the Fascist Party and helped depose the
dictator in 1943, has died at the age of 92.
   Grandi died at his home in Bologna on Saturday, the state-run
RAI-TV said. He had reportedly been suffering cardiac and
circulatory problems.
   Grandi fought in World War I and joined the fascist squads that
terrorized the Italian countryside. He failed to win the leadership
of the fascists at a national congress in 1921 but successfully
made a bid for a seat in Parliament.
   He participated in the October 1922 march on Rome that led to
Mussolini's installation as head of government. Grandi served as
undersecretary of the interior in 1924 and was foreign minister
from 1929 to 1934.
   Grandi clashed with Mussolini, urging him to support Britain and
not Germany in World War II and opposing Italy's active
participation in the campaign. He urged King Victor Emmanuel III to
remove Mussolini from government.
   In July 1943, Grandi presented the government resolution that
deposed Mussolini. Mussolini later headed a puppet government,
supported by the German Nazis, in northern Italy, until he was
captured and hanged by Italian partisans in April 1945.
   A fascist tribunal in 1944 condemned Grandi to death but he had
escaped to Lisbon and went on to Brazil.
   No funeral plans were announced.
   News of Grandi's death came a day before the funeral of Giorgio
Almirante, who had a minor role in Mussolini government and who for
years led Italy's small, but fourth-largest party, the neo-fascist
Italian Social Movement.
   Another neo-fascist figure, Pino Romualdi, died last week. There
will be a joint funeral for Almirante and Romualdi in Rome on
Tuesday.

Bucharest, it was reported Monday.
   Constantin Olteanu, the former defense minister who had headed
the Bucharest party ``was given other assignments on a party
line,'' the state news agency Agerpres said without elaboration.
   As a deputy premier, Radu was responsible for construction
projects and investment. His new appointment to the Bucharest job
gives him responsibility for the giant construction projects
underway in the capital and due for completion by 1990.
   The historic heart of Bucharest has been altered radically since
1985, when work started on a giant new Communist Party headquarters

   Hundreds of old, private homes have been pulled down to make way
for the project, and 28 churches or synagogues have been destroyed

<HEAD>Reagan To Ask Gorbachev Support For Ban On Arms Sales To Iran,
Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, currying
favor with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is likely to balk if
President Reagan asks him to back a U.N. Security Council
resolution barring arms sales to Iran and Iraq, U.S. officials say.
   The Persian Gulf war is expected to be on the agenda when Reagan
and Gorbachev meet May 29-June 2 in Moscow.
   The Soviets went along with a U.S.-sponsored Security Council
resolution in July 1987 urging Iran and Iraq to end the war, which
began in September 1980. The Soviets and the Chinese, however, have
refused to support a followup resolution to stop the flow of arms
to the belligerents.
   ``The chances of passing that resolution peaked about February
or early March,'' said a State Department official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   Because Khomeini wants to continue the war, and Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein wants to end it, the second resolution ``would
amount to a de facto embargo on Iran,'' the official said.
   Also, Gorbachev does not want to offend Khomeini, particularly
as Soviet troops leave Afghanistan and the United States and Iran
remain at loggerheads in the Persian Gulf, the experts say.
   The Soviets and the Chinese are key because they are permanent
members of the Security Council and could veto any resolution.
   The Chinese, who supply Iran with close to half of its weapons,
eased their opposition in February, increasing pressure on the
Soviets, who are the major arms supplier to Iraq.
   But pressure on Moscow fell after the U.S.-Iranian naval battle
on April 18, in which American ships killed 44 Iranians and knocked
out half the opposing navy by disabling two Iranian frigates and
sinking or damaging four speed boats.
   ``The U.S. action in the gulf pushed the Chinese and the
Russians away from backing the resolution,'' said the State
Department source. ``The Russians had always been reluctant on the
second resolution, but this gave them something to hang their hat
on.''
   Khomeini rode to power in 1979 on a wave of indignation against
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a long-time U.S. ally, but the
ayatollah paired his vehement condemnation of the United States,
``the Great Satan,'' with anti-Soviet rhetoric that was nearly as
strong.
   Soviet-Iranian relations improved somewhat following the
disclosure in November 1986 that the Reagan administration secretly
had sold arms to the Khomeini regime.
   And ties between Tehran and Moscow further improved after the
U.S. decision last year to offer naval protection to 11 reflagged
tankers belonging to Kuwait, a non-belligerent ally of Iraq in the
war.
   Lately, however, ``there has been nothing really terribly new''
in Soviet-Iranian ties, said Shireen Hunter, an expert on Iran at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
   Gorbachev faces a ticklish situation as he fulfills his promise
to withdraw an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops out of Afghanistan,
which not only borders Iran, but shares much of its cultural,
ethnic and linguistic heritage.
   Khomeini's cooperation is vital in repatriating 2.5 million
Afghans who fled to Iran following the Soviet invasion in 1979. An
additional 3.5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan pose a similar
problem.
   Iranian cooperation also would assist the Soviets in assuring
``that a neutral state is established in Afghanistan,'' said
Hunter. ``The Russians do not want a pro-Western government in
Afghanistan.''
   Additionally, Khomeini has been backing several groups of
anti-Soviet Afghan guerrillas who share his fundamentalist Shiite
Moslem faith.
   As the Red Army pulls back from forward positions in
Afghanistan, ``the Iranians have the capability to make life
difficult for the Soviets, at least in the outlying areas,'' said
the State Department source.
   In at least one instance, the mujahedden guerrillas and the
Soviets appear to have worked out a modus vivendi.
   ``The mujahedeen have been distributing leaflets in the area of
Ghazni (in eastern Afghanistan) saying they will allow the Soviets
to leave peacefully if the Soviets do not loot civilian houses as
they depart,'' said the source, citing a diplomatic cable from
Kabul. Similar arrangements may exist elsewhere in Afghanistan.

<HEAD>First Drug Treatment Center Scrapped After Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's first in-patient
drug abuse treatment center has been scrapped following protests
from residents, one of whom said addicts should be shot ``like
vermin,'' a weekly newspaper reported.
   The treatment center was to have been housed in a small castle
in Tuchomerice, north of Prague, according to the popular weekly,
Vlasta.
   Opposition grew rapidly once word of the plans spread in a TV
broadcast before authorities informed residents, Vlasta said.
   ``The TV statement was premature, ill-considered and resulted in
hysteria,'' said Jan Klima, a Prague health official. ``Complaints
poured in, then came a signature campaign of those protesting the
plan _ simply, enormous pressure.''
   He said the castle instead will be a center for the elderly, he
said.
   Vlasta quoted unidentified doctors as complaining that drug
addicts now can be treated only in a psychiatric ward in a Prague
suburb or at a center for alcoholics.
   Vlasta first reported on drug addicts last fall and said its
stories on the Tuchomerice case brought ``an unprecedented
response'' from readers. Some letters were sympathetic, but others
used strong language.
   ``I would send them to forced labor or shoot them like vermin,''
wrote one unidentified reader.
   Only recently has drug abuse been discussed in the state-run
media. In 1986, according to the latest statistics, 703 people were
prosecuted on drugs-related charges, Vlasta said. It gave no
figures for Slovakia.

   More than 1,000 mourners braved a
driving rain today to attend a funeral service for 8-year-old
Nicholas Corwin, fatally wounded when a woman stormed an elementary
school and fired on a second-grade classroom.
   Five other children were wounded in Friday's attack in nearby
Winnetka by Laurie Dann, 30, who then shot and injured a man as she
took over his family's home. She died at the house hours later of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound.
   ``Nicky is gone _ long before his time, and the pain is great,''
Rabbi Robert Schreibman told the gathering at Temple Jeremiah in
this north Chicago suburb.
   ``I wonder what we could possibly say to relieve such
unconscionable grief. But we can find none,'' said Schreibman in
prepared remarks.
   Reporters were not allowed inside the temple for the half-hour
service.
   Dozens of children, many of them in brightly colored rain
slickers, walked solemnly into the temple before the service began.
A memorial service was planned later today at Hubbard Woods
Elementary School, where Friday's shooting occurred. Classes were
canceled today.
   At Temple Jeremiah, a sign saying ``Shalom'' _ which in Hebrew
means peace, hello and goodbye _ was pasted on a south window.
   After the service, Nicholas' parents, Joel and Linda Corwin, and
his brothers, Michael and Jonathan, accompanied the casket as it
was placed in a hearse for the drive to Memorial Park Cemetery in
nearby Skokie.
   After Ms. Dann's shooting rampage and suicide, authorities began
trying to unravel the psychological puzzle she left behind. Before
the school shooting, Ms. Dann had set fire to a home and delivered
tainted treats to two college fraternities and several homes where
she had worked as a baby sitter.
   Many of those who received the treats were on a list found in
Ms. Dann's apartment in Madison, Wis., according to police. They
said no one was seriously sickened by the poisoned fruit juice and
cereal snacks.
   ``This is a seriously destroyed individual who lost control and
acted out all of her delusions,'' said Dr. Harold Visotsky,
professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry at
Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
   ``She acted on all the elements of revenge she wanted to play
out. Once you begin imagining injury or pain, everyone has to be
punished,'' he said Sunday.
   Ms. Dann probably saw herself as a victim and sought revenge
against those who had ``diminished her sense of self-worth,''
Visotsky said.
   ``There obviously is a connection with children here. We don't
know what,'' Police Chief Herbert Timm said today on ``This
Morning,'' the CBS morning show.
   He said authorities ``are just keeping our fingers crossed that
it is over.''
   ``We've been surprised very often by Laurie, but we're ready for
anything, to be honest with you,'' he said. ``We thought this
nightmare ended Friday evening, but then Saturday morning of course
we were surprised to find out about the poisoning situation.''
   At Sunday religious services in the quiet Chicago suburb,
worshipers were asked to pray for Ms. Dann and her victims. Six
people remain hospitalized, four in fair condition, one in critical
condition and one listed as serious.
   ``Today we will pray for Laurie Dann because, for what she did,
she could not have been in her right mind,'' said the Rev. Mike
Weston of Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church. ``And because she was
once a child and a Christian and ... because Jesus prayed for his
enemies.''
   Visotsky and police agreed that the trigger for Friday's
violence appeared to have been Ms. Dann's discovery that a family
for whom she worked as a baby sitter planned to move away.
   On the morning of the shootings, Ms. Dann set a small fire in
the family's house and gave tainted milk to two of the family's
children.
   She then drove to the school and shot a boy in a bathroom and
brandished a handgun in the classroom, wounding five children,
including young Nicholas.
   A substitute teacher, Amy Moses, grabbed Ms. Dann in trying to
stop her from shooting the entire classroom of youngsters.
   Ms. Moses, 29, refused to follow Ms. Dann's orders to herd the
24 children together, and grabbed her gunhand before Ms. Dann
pulled another weapon and began firing.
   ``I just acted instinctually. I just wanted to protect the
children,'' said said Ms. Moses, adding that she ``just went on
automatic pilot.''
   Ms. Dann then fled the school, crashed her car and ran to a home
a few blocks away, where she wounded a 20-year-old man and
barricaded herself inside for several hours before shooting herself
in the head.
   Ms. Dann, daughter of a wealthy suburban family and former
student at the University of Arizona in Tucson, was due to stand
trial in Madison on charges of shoplifting several women's wigs
March 14.
   She also was being sought by federal authorities for making
threatening telephone calls in three states to former friends and
members of her ex-husband's family.

   Guerrillas rocketed Afghanistan's capital on
Monday, killing one woman, and the Marxist government again
protested Pakistani support of the Moslem insurgents, Tass reported
   A dispatch from the official Soviet news agency said the
guerrillas fired six rockets into Kabul and hit a shoe factory. In
addition to the one woman killed, another was wounded, Tass said.
   Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry gave United Nations monitors in
Kabul a note demanding an investigation into the aid given to the
guerrillas from Pakistan.
   It was the third time the Afghanistan government has protested
to the United Nations that Pakistan is violating the April 14
international agreement providing for withdrawal of Soviet forces.
   The previous note was given to Pakistan on Thursday, Tass said.
   The April 14 agreement, signed in Geneva, pledges that Pakistan
not interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Pakistan is home
to Afghan guerrillas in bases on its territory, and they receive
their weapons from the United States.
   A Soviet-inspired revolution in April 1978 brought a Marxist
leadership to power in Afghanistan. The Kremlin sent troops and
tanks in December 1979 to help the allied Kabul government fight
widespread rebellion.
   The Kremlin is to withdraw its troops, estimated to number
115,000, within nine months under the Geneva accord. The first
troops left Afghanistan on May 15.

   Two ``masters of modern architecture,'' Oscar
Niemeyer of Brazil and Gordon Bunshaft of the United States, have
been named 1988 co-winners of the Pritzker Architecture Prize.
   ``We are delighted that the jury has used the occasion of the
10th anniversary of the prize to honor not one, but two masters of
modern architecture,'' said Jay Pritzker, president of the
sponsoring Hyatt Foundation.
   The $100,000 prizes were established by the Pritzker family of
Chicago in 1979 to honor a creative endeavor not included in the
Nobel Prizes.
   The foundation said in a release that Niemeyer, 80, and
Bunshaft, 79, will share the grant equally.
   Niemeyer, a native of Rio de Janiero, is perhaps best known for
his designs for most of the public buildings in Brasilia, the
Brazilian capital built from scratch in a remote area.
   Niemeyer also designed the United Nations headquarters in New
York City in collaboration with the late French architect Le
Courbusier.
   Bunshaft became famous in the 1950s for his skyscrapers, many in
New York City.
   His 24-story Lever House, completed in 1953, is the newest
building to be granted landmark status by the New York Landmarks
Conservancy.

   Lia Belli, the wife of famed lawyer Melvin
Belli, faces a $75,000 fine for alleged campaign financing
violations in her unsuccessful 1984 state Senate campaign, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported that its sources said Mrs.
Belli has agreed to pay the fine as part of a deal with the Fair
Political Practices Commission.
   Sources said the fine concerns at least $60,000 in hidden
campaign contributions from a family member.
   Mrs. Belli and her husband both declined to respond to several
requests for interviews. An attorney who represents her, Richard
Brown, said, ``It's just not in anyone's interest to discuss this.''
   Mrs. Belli raised $882,505 for the campaign, most of it in loans
from the family, according to the Chronicle. She was defeated by
Milton Marks by a 2-1 margin.
   It is not illegal for candidates to lend themselves money to
finance their campaigns, but the money must be fully disclosed on
state reports.

   Queen Elizabeth II is getting a loaner from
Australia for her press office.
   Buckingham Palace announced Monday the appointment of Australian
diplomat Geoffrey Crawford as the queen's assistant press secretary.
   Crawford, 37, will be on loan from the Australian Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade, which he joined in 1974.
   His appointment revives longstanding links between the
Buckingham Palace press office and the Commonwealth, the 48-nation
association of Britain and its former colonies.
   When Crawford takes up his duties in June, he will be the ninth
assistant press secretary from the Commonwealth. The last, Canadian
Vic Chapman, resigned in October, two months before he died of
cancer.

   Tyka Nelson, the sister of Rock star Prince,
is into blue for her recording debut rather than the color purple
associated with her famous brother.
   Her album, ``Royal Blue,'' will be released next week.
   The name of Nelson's album comes from an included song title and
reflects the tone of the record, she told the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis in an interview published Monday.
   ``I'd call it a different kind of blues. That's the mood I was
in,'' said Nelson, 28, who lives in a suburb near where she grew up
in Minneapolis.
   ``The album is basically about love relationships between a man
and a woman. I'm royal blue because I can't find him,'' she said.
   Nelson's material, mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening,
is far removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound.
Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.
   Prince, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen where
he has a recording studio, is best known for his 1984 blockbuster,
``Purple Rain,'' which was the soundtrack for his movie of the same
name.
   On her relationship to her brother, Nelson told the Star
Tribune: ``The funniest thing is people say, `How does it feel to
be Prince's sister?' They don't actually realize what they're
saying. I've been Prince's sister ever since I got here on Earth.''

   Actor Keith Carradine chose to stay away from
strictly leading-man roles and looked for character parts that
would prove he was talented as well as versatile.
   ``I come from a family of character actors,'' said Carradine,
whose show business family includes father John Carradine and
brothers David and Robert. ``It is a business, and the Hollywood
career strategy is to cater to the widest possible range.
   ``My career consists of art films and television. I've gone into
TV work to subsidize my features career. Peculiar, isn't it? But
I've managed to choose TV that's quality. Just now, in the next few
years, it is starting to pay off,'' Carradine said in an interview
published last week.
   Carradine's credits include ``Southern Comfort,'' ``The Long
Riders,'' ``Pretty Baby'' and the just-released ``The Moderns.''
   ``I could easily have taken the leading-man route. But I
consciously chose character roles. This is a town where you have to
prove what you can do,'' he said.
   ``I'd be bored being a personality actor.''

<TEXT>
   The town named after one of the 20th
century's greatest athletes is planning a big party for his 100th
birthday, although they're a year late according to folks Jim
Thorpe's native state of Oklahoma.
   This scenic Carbon County town is enjoying a renaissance that
started about the time Thorpe's body was laid to rest here. Jim
Thorpe's Mausoleum at the borough's east end was dedicated in 1957.
   Jim Thorpe Centennial Committee officials plan to start the
celebration Saturday by releasing balloons. Present will be former
Philadelphia Eagles football star Chuck Bednarik and an Indian
princess to discuss Thorpe's heritage. Several North American
crabapple trees will be planted to beautify the mausoleum area.
   Runners are also being lined up to carry Olympic-style torches
from the train station in downtown Jim Thorpe to the mausoleum. And
a huge birthday cake will be on display next to the train station
for everyone present to taste.
   ``It'll be a traditional birthday party,'' John Gunsser,
co-chairman of the centennial committee. ``We're not looking for a
carnival atmosphere; we just want to say `Happy Birthday' in a
down-homey kind of way.''
   In Yale, Okla., however, sightseers and arts and crafts shoppers
turned out Sunday for what they said was Thorpe's 101st birthday.
   ``Everything went really nice,'' said Grace Thorpe, who spent
the day dishing out cake and punch and giving people tours of her
famous father's home.
   For several years, Thorpe's birthdate has been a mystery. Thorpe
never knew exactly when he was born, and his birth records were
destroyed by fire.
   ``Records will show he was born in 1886, 1887, 1888; some will
say May 22, some May 23,'' Ms. Thorpe said. In 1979, she said she
discovered her father's baptismal record, showing he was christened
Nov. 17, 1887, and born May 22 of that year.
   Ms. Thorpe, not one to play favorites with her father's
birthday, said she plans to attend the Pennsylvania celebration.
   Thorpe won fame in the 1912 Olympics, winning both the decathlon
and pentathlon, but his medals were taken away a month later when
Olympic officials determined that he had played baseball for a
small salary before entering what was supposed to be an amateur
competition. His gold medals were returned to his family several
years ago.

   Dolly Parton will be gone from ABC's fall
schedule, but Burt Reynolds will be on as a private eye and Peter
Falk returns as the rumpled Lt. Columbo in a movie series that
rotates them with Louis Gossett Jr. as a globe-trotting
anthropologist.
   As expected, ABC canceled its $40 million variety show gamble
``Dolly!'' and dropped ``Spenser: For Hire,'' the Boston-based
private detective show that struggled for three years in the
ratings.
   Also gone are ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story,'' ``Ohara,'' ``The
Charmings,'' ``Buck James,'' ``I Married Dora'' and
``Sledgehammer!''
   Spring replacements ``The Wonder Years,'' ``China Beach,''
``HeartBeat'' and ``Just the Ten of Us,'' will be back in the fall,
while ``thirtysomething,'' ``Hooperman'' and ``Full House'' will
return for their second seasons.
   New series are ``Roseanne,'' with stand-up comic Roseanne Barr
as a housewife; ``Knightwatch,'' about a group of young
crime-fighters a la the Guardian Angels; ``Murphy's Law,'' starring
George Segal as an insurance investigator, and ``A Fine Romance,''
starring Anthony Andrews as a TV personality who shares the screen
with his ex-wife.
   Falk recreates the Columbo role he played on NBC from 1971 to
1977. The two-hour Columbo episodes will be part of a rotating
``ABC Mystery Movie'' series. Reynolds will play a New York cop who
moves to Florida to start a new life as a private investigator and
Gossett an anthropology professor in search of adventure.
   ABC also announced possible mid-season replacements for 1988-89,
including ``Studio 5B,'' a comedy about network morning television
(NBC's ``Today'' show comes from Studio 3B); ``The Robert Guillaume
Show,'' in which Guillaume plays a divorced marriage counselor with
two children, a live-in father and an interracial romance;
``Coach,'' a comedy with Craig T. Nelson in the title role, and
``Have Faith,'' a comedy about five Catholic priests, starring Joel
Higgins, Ron Carey and Stephen Furst.
   The biggest schedule move is ``Dynasty'' from its longtime
Wednesday time period to Thursday opposite NBC's comedies. ``The
Disney Sunday Movie,'' which moved to NBC, is replaced by
``Incredible Sunday,'' an updated ``That's Incredible!''
   ABC's big miniseries event next season will be the 30-hour ``War
and Remembrance'' sequel to ``The Winds of War.'' The network also
plans a three-hour movie, ``Challenger,'' about the space shuttle
disaster.
   Other miniseries include ``The Underground Empire,'' based on
James Mills' book about the drug trade, and ``The Women of Brewster
Place,'' about seven black women in a Chicago tenement.
   Just when the fall schedule will debut remains a question
because of the strike by the Writers Guild of America, but here is
ABC's intended schedule for the fall:
   Monday: ``MacGyver,'' ``Monday Night Football.''
   Tuesday: ``Who's the Boss?'' ``Roseanne,'' ``Moonlighting,''
``thirtysomething.''
   Wednesday: ``Growing Pains,'' ``Head of the Class,'' ``The
Wonder Years,'' ``Hooperman,'' ``China Beach.''
   Thursday: ``Knightwatch,'' ``Dynasty,'' ``HeartBeat.''
   Friday: ``Perfect Strangers,'' ``Full House,'' ``Mr.
Belvedere,'' ``Just the Ten of Us,'' ``20-20.''
   Saturday: ``Murphy's Law,'' ``ABC Mystery Movie.''
   Sunday: ``Incredible Sunday,'' ``A Fine Romance,'' ``ABC Sunday
Movie.''

<HEAD>Small High School Graduating Class Gets Visit from Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGATE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took all of 21 seconds to hand out
diplomas to Agate High School's graduating class and for Gov. Roy
Romer to shake hands with the graduates.
   Richard Padilla was class valedictorian, and Penny Robbins was
the salutatorian. They were also next-to-last and last in their
class.
   Romer gave the commencement address Sunday at the high school
about 70 miles east of Denver because he wanted to show that big is
not better than small.
   ``When you're from a small town, you feel like Tail-End
Charlie,'' said Romer, whose hometown of Holly isn't much bigger
than Agate, population 100. ``I want to reverse that.''
   The 59-year-old chief executive told the two graduates and about
100 of their neighbors and relatives: ``You have a gift being from
Agate. It's a gift of a community small enough to know each other,
to share your hopes and fears and dreams. There's something
absolutely good about that.''
   ``Maybe when you're in the work world, you will be able to say,
`Let me tell you how we did it in Agate,''' Romer said. ``Don't
laugh at that phrase. There's a lot of wisdom that comes from rural
communities.''
   After the 48-minute ceremony, Robbins and Padilla walked
hand-in-hand down the center aisle and threw their mortarboard caps
into the air.
   Padilla plans to be a mechanic, and Robbins plans to study
business management this fall at Morgan Community College in Fort
Morgan.

   Vandals stenciled swastikas and scrawled an
anti-Semitic slogan on a synagogue, prompting the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith to demand prison terms for such offenses and
post a $1,000 reward for information.
   ``I'd like to see the steel doors slam shut behind someone this
time,'' said Arthur Teitelbaum, ADL southern area director. ``Maybe
that's what is needed to put a stop to this.''
   The three swastikas and the words ``Die Jew'' were painted on
the Bet Breira synagogue in suburban Kendall over the weekend,
police said.
   About 1{ miles away at Killian High School, vandals also
stenciled five swastikas, along with ``Neo-Nazi Rules'' and
``Hitler Lives,'' police said.
   Police had no suspects, Metro-Dade police spokesman James Wright
said Monday.
   Desecration of a house of worship is punishable by up to five
years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   Teen-agers charged with throwing rocks and scrawling a swastika
at a synagogue Feb. 26 recently were sentenced to 200 hours of
community service, and had to pay for $14,800 in damage.
   Reported anti-Semitic incidents have nearly doubled in Florida
this year, with 44 reported so far compared to 64 in all of 1987,
Teitelbaum. Nationwide there were 694 incidents in 1987, Teitelbaum.
   The weekend attack at the synagogue was particularly unsettling
because it appeared well-planned, Teitelbaum said Sunday.
   ``I do feel the attack was premeditated because of the
stencils,'' he said. ``Fundamentally, it is the virus of bigotry
that is expressed in these acts. What is really worrisome is that a
new generation of persons has been infected.''
   ``There is a great deal of prejudice and hatred in Dade County,
and this act shows that more integration between Anglos, blacks,
Hispanics, Jews and gentiles needs to take place,'' said Barry
Tabachnikoff, rabbi at the 450-member Bet Breira Congregation. ``We
still have a lot of work to do, especially in the religious
community.''

   Hollywood's famous sign had been abbreviated
and obliterated, but never belted or buckled _ until Monday.
   It's a cinch that's sure to click with a lot of drivers,
promoters hope.
   Several celebrities and safety representatives teamed up Monday
to strap what they called the world's largest seat belt around the
landmark Hollywood sign.
   ``Knot's Landing'' star Michele Lee, chairwoman of the Committee
for Safety Belt Awareness for the Entertainment Industries Council,
joined National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Diane Steed
and members of the American Coalition for Traffic Safety for the
ceremonial buckling.
   The safety belt, measuring 400 feet long and 10 feet wide, was
fastened with a symbolic click around the 55-foot high letters to
kick off Buckle Up America! Week.
   ``Buckling up and drunk driving have long been priority issues
for myself and for the Entertainment Industries Council,'' Miss Lee
said. ``We welcome this opportunity to show America that Hollywood
cares about saving lives and that the entertainment community is
committed to these two vital issues.''

<HEAD>Party Meeting Shaping Up as Face-off on Reform Pace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Next month's Communist Party conference is shaping
up to be a face-off between supporters of radical change and
advocates of just ``a little polishing up'' of the old Soviet
system, party activists reported Monday.
   Despite efforts by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to draw only backers of
his policy of ``perestroika,'' or wholesale rebuilding of Soviet
society, some who fear reform is being introduced too quickly may
be selected as delegates to the June 28 conference.
   A closed-door meeting of the party Central Committee devoted to
preparations for next month's conference selected Gorbachev to
deliver the key address to the gathering, which will pass judgment
on his reform program, the Tass news agency reported.
   But senior advisers on the economy and social trends made clear
at a news conference that conflicting viewpoints on the pace of
reform are becoming more apparent.
   It has not even been decided whether the party gathering _ the
first of its kind since 1941 _ will be televised, according to
delegate Sergei P. Zalygin, editor of the journal Novy Mir (New
World).
   Gorbachev addressed the plenary session of the Central Committee
before and after a debate among the more than 300 members, Tass
said. No details of his or other speeches were released.
   Kremlin No. 2 Yegor K. Ligachev told a foreign policy meeting
later in the day that the plenum had ``a very interesting and
lively debate'' over the proposals to be presented at the
conference.
   Ligachev has made clear in previous speeches that he favors a
more moderate pace of reform.
   The theses put together by the ruling 13-man Politburo make ``a
number of important suggestions and proposals relative to the
implementation of perestroika, glasnost, democratization and the
implementation of a healthy political atmosphere,'' Ligachev said.
   He gave no details, but said the proposals will be published
before the conference.
   Four of the nation's most respected advisers on perestroika told
reporters the conference is heightening differences among
policy-makers.
   Tatiana Zaslavskaya, the nation's leading sociologist and a
staunch reform advocate, said if perestroika is to succeed, ``we
will have to fight and struggle for it to see that we meet these
goals.''
   She indicated there are two groups which want perestroika
carried out differently. Asked who heads the factions, Ms.
Zaslavskaya said Gorbachev is obviously the figurehead for the
radical-reform branch, but she said she did not know any leading
``personalities at the head of the other movement.''
   Ligachev is reputed to champion more conservative views on the
Politburo, and last month was reported to have had a showdown with
Gorbachev following publication of a defense of Stalinism in the
party newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya. But he has made several
high-profile appearances, including his parliamentary address
Monday, indicating he and Gorbachev are putting out a unified front
leading up to the important conference.
   In an interview with The Washington Post that was published
Sunday, Gorbachev labeled as ``Western media'' creations those
accounts that he and Legachev are locked in a struggle for power,
although he acknowledged that ``heated debate'' has developed over
perestroika within the nation.
   Party conferences, which consider major changes in direction in
social and economic development, can be called between party
congresses, which take place every five years. They were held
frequently until World War II.
   Ms. Zaslavskaya appeared to criticize the party's monopoly on
power when asked about the system for selecting the 5,000 delegates
to the conference.
   ``The fact that the party delegates are selected by the party
machinery, by the party committees, effects the procedure, and not
in every case can it be called a democratic effect,'' she said.
   It was not clear whether she was advocating extension of the
delegate selection into non-party groups or criticizing some of the
officials chosen.
   Gorbachev's reforms curry much less favor in rural regions and
industrial zones outside the capital, where many entrenched party
bureaucrats fear their jobs and privileges hang in the balance. In
those areas, party conference delegates are likely to oppose
radical change.
   On May 7, Gorbachev appealed for selection of those who would
support his approach to reform.
   ``There must be no more quotas, as were the case in the past,
specifying how many factory workers and farmers and how many women
are to be elected, among others,'' Gorbachev told a gathering of
media representatives and ideologists. ``The principal political
directive is to elect active supporters of perestroika to go to the
conference.''
   Little is known about the proposals to be put before the party
conference next month, although several officials have said the
delegates will consider limiting the tenure of the general
secretary.
   There has also been speculation that Gorbachev might take the
opportunity to replace as much as 25 percent of the Central
Committee, ousting those who have not shown sufficient dedication
to his reform programs.
   But Fyodor M. Burlatsky, a prominent political scientist and
writer, told the news conference that ``as far as I know there
would not be additional elections during this party conference.''
   Burlatsky, like Zaslavskaya and the other two officials who
appeared at the news conference, is in the running to attend the
party conference, although the selection procedures have not been
completed.
   ``From my point of view the most important struggle is between
those who want deep changes and others who want a little polishing
up,'' Burlatsky said. ``The struggle is continuing in these areas.''
   Economist Leonid I. Abalkin restated Gorbachev's philosophy that
economic change and broader democracy must go hand in hand.
   ``One without the other is unthinkable,'' Abalkin said.

<HEAD>Party Changes Open Way for Reform in Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reformers who now control the
Communist Party embarked Monday on a program of sweeping changes
they hope will rescue the faltering economy.
   Hungary's turn from old leadership to a new generation of highly
trained managers, intellectuals and economic theorists may be the
most dramatic change of course in Eastern Europe since Alexander
Dubcek's liberal ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
   The most important difference is that Moscow now supports
reform, under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``perestroika'' plan, and the
Warsaw Pact invasion that drove Dubcek out is not likely to be
repeated.
   An outline of Hungarian reform plans was revealed Sunday along
with major changes in party leadership that replaced party leader
Janos Kadar and many of his aging supporters.
   Kadar, leader for nearly 32 years, was replaced by the
reform-minded premier, Karoly Grosz, and top decision-making posts
went to advocates of change.
   Delegates to the three-day party congress that ended Sunday
dropped Kadar, who will be 76 on May 26, from the ruling Politburo
but elected him party president, a new post expected to be largely
ceremonial.
   Some party officials said Kadar might seek to wield a
conservative influence from his new position, but the strength of
reformers in the new leadership indicate they will be able to set
policy.
   Grosz, 57, will continue as premier until the next session of
Parliament, when a replacement might be chosen.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
the United States wishes Grosz well and ``we expect our good
relationship with Hungary will continue to improve.''
   The new party policy statement approved Sunday gives few
specifics, but calls for a greater public voice in economic and
political affairs. It also contemplates a much larger role for
private enterprise to revive the stagnant economy.
   ``The economy must be left alone to make its own decisions,''
Sandor Demjan, president of the Hungarian Credit Bank,'' said
Monday. ``The dullness of Hungarian political life in recent years
has clouded the economic sphere.'' Kadar's government pioneered
economic reforms, which brought relative prosperity from the late
1960s through the 1970s.
   Recent economic setbacks, however, have burdened Hungary with
Eastern Europe's highest per capita foreign debt. It now stands $18
billion.
   Inflation is running at more than 18 percent annually and
austerity measures have been imposed.
   In surprisingly frank debate, delegates to the congress assailed
Kadar and the Communist Party for not averting the economic crisis.
   Budapest party members, who make up almost one quarter of
Hungary's 800,000 Communists, were among the most critical. They
demanded new faces, new policies and a move toward political
pluralism.
   Reformers argued that economic change would fail without similar
action in the political field.
   While the policy document made clear the party's leading role
was not being challenged, it referred frequently to the need for
``socialist pluralism'' in which opposing views would be allowed.
   It outlined the advantages of more foreign investment and joint
ventures with foreign companies. Among political reforms endorsed
were limited terms of office for party officials and laws
guaranteeing freedom of association and other civil rights.
   ``The right of voluntary organization, assembly, association,
freedom of conscience and religion ... and guarantees for the
protection of individual and collective rights must be regulated by
law,'' it said.
   A leading proponent of independent interest groups, Imre
Pozsgay, was among those elected to the ruling Politburo. The
pollicy statement acknowledged his recent comments by saying local
referendums should be held on issues of importance to Hungarians.
   Many interest groups have been formed recently that do not seek
official approval and range in nature from sports groups to an
independent labor union.
   Another notable appointment to the Politburo was Reszo Nyers,
the economist who pioneered reform in the late 1960s. He was ousted
from the party's ruling body in in 1973 for advocating further
changes.
   Thirty-one members of the Central Committee, nearly one-third of
the total, were replaced by young intellectuals and workers. Few
came from the party bureaucracy.
   Six members of the Politburo are new, including two women, and
the membership was reduced from 13 to 11. Its first meeting was
scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEAD>Oxford Blues: Prestigious Posts Vacant Due to Money Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oxford University said Monday it is leaving two of
the world's most prestigious academic posts vacant indefinitely,
citing a financial crisis.
   The regius chairs in Greek and modern history become vacant in
fall 1989 and won't be filled for at least a year, said Anne
Lonsdale, an Oxford spokeswoman.
   She said the regius chairs _ so named because they were created
by royal command _ could remain frozen beyond 1990, depending on
faculty priorities.
   The decision heightens longstanding concern over the ancient
university's future as a citadel of scholarship and scientific
research.
   ``There is a question mark over our status as a world-class
university,'' Sir Michael Howard, the retiring regius professor of
modern history, said in an interview. ``We are being starved of
essential resources.''
   The regius chair in Greek was founded by King Henry VIII in
1546, and the modern history chair by George I in 1727. Both are
widely regarded as being at the apex of scholarship.
   They being left vacant as part of a retrenchment program brought
on by an 11 percent cut in government funding, Mrs. Lonsdale said.
   Under the program, any academic post that becomes vacant is
frozen, usually for two years, until the Faculty Board decides
whether there is enough money to appoint a successor.
   As a result, 122 of Oxford's 1,420 faculty posts in virtually
all disciplines are vacant, Mrs. Lonsdale said.
   Failure to exempt the professorships in modern history and Greek
from the retrenchment reflects the seriousness of Oxford's cash
problem.
   Oxford has a budget of about $186 million, and its deficit is
running at about $3.3 million.
   The university has announced that it will launch a five-year,
worldwide campaign in October to ensure the future of the
university, which received its first charter in 1213. It has not
said how much money it wants to raise in its campaign, but says it
hopes to ensure the financial security of the university into the
next century.
   ``Oxford is beginning to seem like a place under siege,'' the
author A.N. Wilson wrote Monday in London's Daily Mail newspaper.
   Commenting on the professorial vacancies, the deterioration of
books and manuscripts in Oxford's Bodleian Library and the planned
closure of Oxford Playhouse, Wilson said:
   ``When you have a university which can't afford professors of
Greek and history; which can't afford to repair the priceless books
on its library shelves; which can't afford to keep open one of the
most famous undergraduate theaters in the world, then you are
entitled to ask: What is going on?''
   Howard, who is retiring one year early to take up a newly
created chair in military history at Yale University in 1989, said
his post could remain vacant for several years.
   ``There's simply not enough money to go around,'' he said.
   Oxford, Cambridge and Britain's 44 other state-funded
universities have long complained that spending limits imposed by
the Conservative government are threatening the nation's scientific
base and accelerating a brain drain to foreign universities.
   Critics say the government is denying support for research that
has no apparent short-term economic or military benefit. In a 1985
protest, Oxford denied an honorary doctorate to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, herself an Oxford graduate in chemistry.
   ``There is a lack of understanding of the value of scholarship
as an end of itself, irrespective of whether it contributes to the
national income or not,'' Howard said.
   Government officials contend the universities are overly
dependent on state funding and have refused to aggressively pursue
money from industry or even their own alumni.
   The regius professor of Greek, Hugh Lloyd-Jones, who is leaving
next year at the mandatory retirement age of 67, said the failure
to name his replacement goes beyond government policy, and reflects
the values of society at large.
   ``We have a society in which a footballer gets four times as
much as Sir Michael and I get together,'' said Lloyd-Jones.
``Someone who displays himself on television can get 10 times as
much.''
   The base salary for each regius chair is about $48,620 a year.
   Lloyd-Jones said the vacant posts should serve as ``a reminder
to anyone who thinks that we in the 20th century live in a
civilized society.''
   Howard said Oxford is moving fast to become self-sufficient, but
``there is a limit to what we can do over the short term.''

   The Danish movie ``Pelle the Conquerer''
today was named best film of the 41st Cannes Film Festival.
Americans won awards for acting.
   French film star Gerard Depardieu presented the Golden Palm
award to Billie August, who wrote and directed ``Pelle the
Conquerer,'' the story of the hardships endured by a father and son
working as cattlemen in Denmark.
   The prize for best actor went to American Forest Whitaker for
his portrayal of jazz great Charlie Parker in the American film
``Bird,'' directed by Clint Eastwood.
   Three performers shared the best actress award _ American
Barbara Hershey, South African Linda Mvusi and 13-year-old Jodhi
May of Britain.
   The three appeared in the British film ``A World Apart'' which
also won the festival's Special Jury Grand Prize, regarded as a
sort of consolation prize given to the runner-up for the Golden
Palm.
   ``A World Apart'' deals with South Africa's apartheid system as
seen through the eyes of an adolescent (Miss May) whose journalist
parents (Miss Hershey and Jeroen Krabbe) are political activists.
The youngster is taken into a black township by the family servant
Elsie (Ms. Mvusi) who is a key to the girl's political awakening.
   It was the first film by director Chris Menges, who accepted the
award.
   ``Pelle the Conquerer'' (``Pelle Erbreren'') is based on a novel
by Martin Anderson Nexo. It tells the story of Lasse and his
9-year-old son Pelle, who leave Sweden to work as cattlemen on a
farm in Denmark. There, they are treated like slaves until Pelle
revolts and goes out to conquer the world.
   Max von Sydow portrays Lasse. Pelle is played by 13-year-old
Pelle Hvenegaard. It was the young Danish actor's first role.
   Indian director Mira Nair won the Golden Camera award given to
the best young director for her film, ``Salaam Bombay,'' shot in
the streets of the Indian city and telling the story of a group of
destitute children. It was the 30-year-old director's first
full-length film.

<HEAD>Surrogate Mothers, Including Baby M's, Would Ban Baby Brokers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of 17 surrogate mothers, including
landmark surrogate Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, launched a campaign
Monday to try to force baby brokers in 12 states out of business.
   ``Try to help shut these places down,'' implored
Whitehead-Gould, whose precedent-setting ``Baby M'' story was the
subject of a network television movie this week.
   Whitehead-Gould, whose effort to void her surrogating contract
was upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court, called on state legal
systems and the media to join in a campaign against surrogacy.
   She was accompanied by other members of the National Coalition
Against Surrogacy, a group comprising lawyers, doctors and 17
surrogate mothers.
   Coalition leader Jeremy Rifkin said the group on Monday sent
petitions to attorneys general in 12 states where surrogate brokers
are known to operate. Such brokers charge a fee to set up
agreements linking infertile couples with women willing to bear
them a child.
   ``These are the middlemen who have engaged in the unconscionable
act of hiring women as breeders,'' Rifkin said.
   Rifkin said the coalition will mount a four-pronged attack
against the brokers. Along with legal pressure, the group will
attempt to marshal public opinion in states where brokers do
business, and try to force the issue of surrogate parenting into
local and national politics.
   Finally, Rifkin said, the coalition will target newspapers that
run advertising on behalf of surrogate brokers or agencies.
   ``We're going to put all the brokers on notice,'' said Rifkin,
an environmental activist who also has been critical of the new
science of genetic engineering.
   States where brokers operate, according to the coalition, are
California, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and
Washington state.
   Gena Corea, the coalition's co-chairwoman, accused brokers of
preying on lower-income women who need the money but may not
understand the implication of signing away unborn children.
   The surrogates are often abused physically and psychologically
by brokers, Corea claimed.
   ``We want this surrogacy industry gone. Let it stop feeding off
our flesh,'' Corea said.
   Surrogate mother Lauri Yates of Michigan pleaded, ``Please,
before they wreck any more lives, before they cause any more pain,
please close them down.'' Yates said she gave up her twins to an
infertile couple because she and her husband couldn't afford to
raise them.
   Whitehead-Gould became the nation's best-known surrogate after
she refused to surrender her infant daughter to its biological
father and his wife. A state court upheld the father's $10,000
contract.
   But the contract was voided in February by the New Jersey
Supreme Court, even though the court allowed the girl's father,
William Stern, to maintain custody of the child. Last month
Whitehead-Gould struck an agreement with Stern giving her
liberalized visitation rights.
   The case is the subject of the made-for-television film, ``Baby
M,'' which aired Sunday and Monday on ABC. Whitehead-Gould
criticized the film as inaccurate.

<HEAD>Court To Study States' Power to Regulate Natural Gas Production</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs graf 4, At issue, and graf 11, The use-it-or-lose-it, to
CORRECT spelling of Hugoton.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to study the
power of states to regulate natural gas production, including
``use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to stimulate production.
   The court will review a ruling that upheld the power of Kansas
officials to control production from what is believed to be the
largest natural gas reservoir in the world. The justices are not
expected to decide the case until 1989.
   The Kansas Supreme Court in 1987 upheld rules adopted by the
Kansas Corporation Commission that officials said would encourage
production, prevent economic and physical waste and protect the
rights of producers.
   At issue is gas from the Hugoton Field, which extends across
portions of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. About two-thirds of the
field is in Kansas, containing some 4,000 wells as of 1983. Most of
the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines.
   The Kansas Corporation Commission since 1944 imposed rules aimed
at assuring that each well will ultimately produce approximately
the amount of gas underlying the land held by each leaseholder.
   The idea was to treat well owners equally, since gas can migrate
underground from an underproducing area to a well that is
overproducing.
   To assure equal treatment, the state fixed the maximum amount of
gas that can be produced per month from each well.
   In practice, wells cannot always be operated to meet monthly
ceilings for various reasons. For example, a well may be shut in or
there may be low demand in a given month and therefore the well
underproduces.
   To allow for these variables, state officials permitted owners
of underproducing wells to ``save up'' their production ceilings _
creating what are called ``underages'' _ and overproduce in future
months to make up for shortfalls.
   To create a production incentive, the Kansas commission changed
the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within
specified periods of years or they would be canceled.
   The use-it-or-lose-it rule was challenged by Northwest Central
Pipeline Corp., one of the major buyers of the Hugoton gas for
transport outside the state.
   Northwest Central said the 1983 rule change prevents it from
purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to by contract. The
pipeline company said cancellation of the underages means that it
unfairly may lose reservoirs of gas when they migrate underground
and later are replaced by other migrating supplies.
   The pipeline company asked the Supreme Court to strike down the
1983 regulations on grounds that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production.
   The Reagan administration sided with Kansas officials in urging
the high court not to disturb the Kansas Supreme Court ruling.
   The Justice Department said the Kansas commission lawfully is
regulating production and is not directly regulating the interstate
pipeline companies that are subject to federal authority.
   The department said the Kansas case is distinct from a decision
by the Supreme Court in 1986 that added a new limitation on states'
power to regulate natural gas prices.
   The court said then that Mississippi may not require an
interstate pipeline to buy gas from all owners of a common gas pool
when the pipeline had pre-existing contracts with only some of the
owners.
   The case acted on Monday is Northwest Central Pipeline vs.
Kansas, 86-1856.

   The Soviet parliament endorsed the
intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty Monday but a top official
said the Kremlin should not ratify the superpower agreement before
the U.S. Senate does.
   Members of the foreign affairs committees of the Supreme
Soviet's two chambers met in a brief joint session to unanimously
endorse the treaty and send it to the Presidium, the highest
executive body, for ratification.
   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the pact to
destroy U.S. and Soviet medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles,
on Dec. 8 in Washington. They begin another summit Sunday in Moscow
and hope the treaty will be ratified before it ends.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, No. 2 in the Kremlin to Gorbachev, presided
at the meeting of about 20 committee members. It was the
culmination of a process begun Feb. 9, when Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze appeared before lawmakers to speak for the treaty.
   By approving ratification, the committees set the stage for
final action by the Presidium, which ratifies international
agreements.
   Soviet ratification has been considered certain because the
treaty was endorsed by the Politburo, supreme body of the Communist
Party, and signed by Gorbachev, who is both Communist Party chief
and a Presidium member.
   Soviet officials have acknowldged, however, that they want the
formal ratification processes in both countries to proceed
together. The Senate is not expected to act on the treaty this week.
   Viktor P. Karpov, head of the Foreign Ministry arms control and
disarmament desk, told Western reporters his country should not
ratify the treaty before the United States.
   ``I think it depends on the decision of the U.S. Senate,'' he
said at the end of the committee meeting, which lasted just over an
hour. ``I think we should wait for the decision to be made. We
should be sure that we are not alone.''
   The Soviets have said past U.S. actions on arms control treaties
made them wary of moving too rapidly with ratification of the
latest agreement.
   In 1979, the Washington and Moscow signed SALT II setting limits
on long-range nuclear weapons. President Jimmy Carter withdrew it
from Senate consideration after the Soviets sent soldiers into
Afghanistan in December of that year.
   Karpov said endorsement by the Supreme Soviet committees showed
his country supports the treaty, and declared: ``We are ready to
ratify it, and (they) have recommended to the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet to ratify it.''
   Tuesday is opening day for the regular spring session of the
1,500-member Supreme Soviet, but there has been no official
indication it will act on the treaty. A vote by the full membership
is not needed for ratification.
   Anatoly F. Dobrynin, Communist Party foreign affairs secretary
and former ambassador to Washington, expressed hope at the
committee meeting that the Senate would act on the treaty before
the summit.
   Dobrynin attended the meeting as chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Commission of the Soviet of Nationalties. Ligachev chairs the
equivalent committee in the other chamber, the Soviet of the Union.
   A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said earlier
Monday that U.S. ratification during the summit remains possible
but some senators still have questions about the treaty.
   Sen. William Cohen, a Maine Republican, told CBS News that three
conservative Republicans still want to debate some issues and that
``will take a good part of this week to conclude.''
   At least 67 votes in the 100-member Senate are required for
ratification.
   On April 20, a commission created by the two committees of the
Supreme Soviet recommended ratification.
   Its chairman, Georgi M. Kornienko, said at the Monday meeting
the treaty would remove ``two links of the nuclear chain that have
circled our Mother Earth.''

<HEAD>Vote Tuesday On New Tahoe City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STATELINE, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in several resort communities
decide Tuesday whether to form a new city to be called Lake Tahoe,
a measure opposed by casinos but favored by residents demanding
more for their taxes.
   The new city, with a population of about 6,500, would embrace
the gambling resort of Stateline and would be situated along 15
miles of Lake Tahoe's southeastern shore.
   Fewer than 3,000 registered voters in the Tahoe Township of
Douglas County are expected to go to the polls Tuesday to decide on
the measure, which has generated some 20 years of debate, hearings
and court battles.
   If the plan is approved, another election will be held to
organize the government.
   Proponents of the new city say the lakeshore communities
comprise nearly 25 percent of the county's population while
contributing 60 percent of the tax revenue. They say they do not
receive a proportionate share in services.
   ``We want to keep our tax dollars here,'' said Bill Bigham, a
leader of the movement to create the city Lake Tahoe, Nev.
   Ron Nino, leader of the opposition, said a city government will
only raise taxes without a corresponding improvement in services.
   The opposition has received financial support from the Stateline
casinos, whose tax burden Nino said would rise by at least $300,000
yearly under a city government. ``What will they get for it? Not
much,'' he added.
   Douglas County commissioners also advised against the idea.
   The county has said it stands to lose about $1.8 million in
yearly tax revenue, most of it from the big Stateline casinos, if
voters approve the plan, because property and gaming taxes will
shift from the county to city.
   The plan also produced an unsuccessful challenge in state court
last year and complaints from communities in California, on the
western side of the lake, that the name Lake Tahoe would create
confusion in the public mind between Lake Tahoe the lake and Lake
Tahoe the city.
   The new city, which would embrace such communities as Glenbrook,
Zephyr Cove, Round Hill, Cave Rock and Marla Bay, couldn't start
its business before July 1, 1989.

<HEAD>Iranian Ships Maneuver in Hormuz; U.S. Ships Steam Through Suez</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several Iranian warships conducted
maneuvers Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, apparently trying to show
continued readiness despite recent losses.
   Five U.S. warships destined for duty in the Persian Gulf passed
through the Suez Canal on Monday. The destroyer John Hancock and
missile frigates Fahrion, Halyburton, Nicholas and Robert G.
Bradley are to replace a missile cruiser and four frigates at the
end of this month.
   Gulf shipping executives said a large Iranian vessel that may
have been a destroyer, two frigates and a landing craft were seen
near Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas.
   They said the ships could not be identified with certainty, but
the largest appeared to be a destroyer that has not been active for
more than a year in the gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been at war
since September 1980. The executives spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Iran has three destroyers, built during World War II for Britain
and the United States. They were modernized in the early 1970s with
anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, radar and other equipment.
   None has been seen in many months, leading military analysts to
speculate they were out of commission.
   Capt. Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships, said the
status of the former Royal Navy destroyer Damavand was ``very
doubtful'' but at least one, and probably both, former U.S. Navy
ships were operational.
   The Iranians said Sunday it was conducting naval exercises in
the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean. It said about 50
ships were involved, including ``missile carrying destroyers,
destroyers, missile launching frigates and personnel carriers.''
   Their official Islamic Republic News Agency said the maneuvers,
called Zolfaqar-3, would last several days. It said they would
involve ``land, sea and air operations and ... the latest
technology in sea wars,'' including radar and radio jamming, aerial
target tracking, paratroop drops, mine sweeping and interception of
air raids.
   IRNA quoted a naval intelligence officer it did not name as
saying the exercises were aimed at ``disproving U.S. claims that it
had crippled half the hardware of the Iranian navy.''
   Iran accused the U.S. Navy of providing assistance for Iraqi
jets that made a devastating air strike May 14 on Iran's Larak
island oil terminal in Hormuz, the narrow southern gateway to the
gulf, in which five tankers were damaged.
   On Apri1 18, U.S. warships and planes sank or disabled six
Iranian naval craft in a series of clashes.
   Iran's losses included the British-built frigate Sahand, a fast
attack boat and two armed speedboats sunk, the frigate Sabalan
disabled and a speedboat probably sunk.
   Tehran has acknowledged damage to several ships, including the
Sahand and Sabalan, and more than 40 sailors killed.
   U.S. casualties were two Marine pilots killed when their AH-1
Cobra helicopter gunship was lost. The Iranians claim they shot it
down.
   Since the clashes in April, the ``rules of engagement'' for U.S.
Navy ships have been changed so they can intervene in attacks by
Iranian vessels on neutral ships in international waters.
   Iranian speedboats have raided two ships in Hormuz in the past
week, but there have been no confrontations with the U.S. Navy
since April 18. None of the larger Iranian vessels sighted Monday
were involved in that fighting.
   The only one seen previously, on May 10, was the Alvand, a
sister ship of the two frigates hit last month. Western analysts
have said the other frigate, Alborz, was non-operational but senior
Navy officials said recently that both were back on duty.

   Sikh worshipers sobbed as they entered
the Golden Temple on Monday for the first time since the sacred
shrine was reopened after a two-week siege in which at least 46
people died, a city official said.
   Over 15,000 Sikh men, women and children waited solemnly in the
113-degree heat as security officials frisked them for weapons
before allowing them to enter the 400-year-old temple.
   It was closed during a police siege May 9-18 aimed at driving
Sikh separatists from their hiding places inside. At least 46
people, mostly Siklh militants, died during the clashes.
   Amitsar deputy commissioner Sarabjeet Singh said no incidents of
violence were reported Monday.
   ``We had a few emotional ourbrusts by some of the devotees,'' he
added.
   Some wept as they walked past the rooms from which Sikh radicals
shot back at Indian security men during the siege.
   ``I knew some of the boys, they were brave, maybe misguided,''
said Harbans Singh, 70, a Sikh farmer.
   ``The government operation has hurt our sentiment, there was no
need to kill so many people,'' said Surinder Kaur of Amritsar.
   United News of India quoted a majority of the worshipers
praising the government action.
   Religious services in the inner sanctum of the temple, suspended
on the second day of the siege, were resumed Sunday after
volunteers washed the floor of the temple with milk in a cleansing
ritual.
   Police and paramilitary troops cordoned off the shrine to
enforce a curfew still imposed on the area within 300 yards of its
walls.
   Deputy Commissioner Singh said the cordon would be lifted after
the government reaches an agreement with temple officials to stop
the shrine from being used as a hideout for Sikh radicals.
   Sikh gunmen, meanwhile, shot and killed four people in other
parts of Punjab state in overnight attacks, police said.
   Among the victims was a Hindu school headmaster, Tilak Raj, who
was shot and killed Monday by two Sikh radicals in front of 400
students in the town of Sangatpura, 15 miles north of Amritsar.
   The assailants ordered him out of his office and shot him at
point-blank range with a revolver, according to Gurmeet Singh, a
police officer.
   A note left by the Khalistan Commando Force, the most powerful
of the Sikh separatist groups, said Raj was killed to avenge the
siege of the Golden Temple. The note said more killings would
follow.
   Sikh separatists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
an independent Sikh homeland in this agricultural state, where they
form a majority of the population.
   The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to India's warring Hindus and Moslems, make up 2
percent of India's 800 million people. They claim they are
discriminated against by the majority, which is 80 percent Hindu.
   Monday's killings raised to more than 1,150 the number of people
killed by Sikh extremists in Punjab state since the start of the
year. In 1987, 1,030 people were killed.

<HEAD>Dukakis Campaign Lining Up Business Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, whose relations with the business
community have been mixed during his tenure as Massachussetts
governor, is not willing to concede business support to its
traditional home in the Republican Party.
   Business leaders aligned with the Democratic front-runner's
campaign hope to sign up a minimum of 5,000 executives nationwide
for a national business coalition, with group leaders appearing on
behalf of Dukakis at conventions and other events.
   George Bush, with his entrepreneurial background and Republican
pedigree, has a ready-made base of support in the business arena.
But organizers of the Dukakis effort, to be officially announced
when leadership roles are filled, say their venture into
traditionally Republican circles has been well received because of
dissatisfaction with the Reagan administration's handling of the
trade and budget deficits.
   ``The conventional question about the Democratic Party's
candidates is their ability to make the hard economic decisions,
the business decisions,'' said Robert Farmer, a wealthy businessman
and Dukakis' top fund-raiser. ``For the first time in 20 years,
we've got a candidate with credibility on the economy and a record
of fiscal responsibility.''
   The first phase of the effort involves recruiting professionals
who have donated to the Dukakis campaign. Farmer has given Richard
Giesser, who is organizing the coalition, lists of contributors
with business ties.
   ``That's where you start,'' said Farmer. ``If you already bet $2
on a horse race you're apt to root for that horse all the way
around the track.''
   Giesser, chairman of the Massachussetts Port Authority, declined
to list prospective members of the group. Among Massachusetts
businessmen working with Giesser are Joe Henson, president of Prime
Computer Inc., and John J. Cullinane, the founder and president of
computer software maker Cullinet Inc.
   Another recent addition is prominent New York businessman John
Dyson, who promised to recruit 400 to 500 business officials in his
state.
   ``I think we will be able to organize such a group around the
country that (it) will surprise people,'' said Dyson, who met with
Dukakis at the Massachusetts Statehouse last week. ``Much of the
Republican Party takes business for granted,'' he said.
   Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute in Washington, termed it unlikely that Dukakis could pull
support of a majority of top business leaders.
   ``But I think you're going to find that Dukakis is going to have
some success in getting serious business support,'' he said. ``It
can help. He's running the umbrella type campaign and trying to
keep the umbrella as big as possible. The more support he gets from
credible people in business and other groups, the more credence
people will give to his message.''
   Hensen and Cullinane are among Dukakis' top business backers in
Massachusetts _ proponents of public-private partnerships that
Dukakis has promoted to steer companies to economically struggling
areas of the state.
   Many other high-tech officials have long battled Dukakis on
issues ranging from state spending to environmental policy, and
small businessmen lately have criticized a new state law that
requires most employers to give workers health insurance by 1992.
   Even his detractors believe Dukakis will have at least limited
success in lining up business support.
   ``We've been saying for some time that he has been
overspending,'' said Howard Foley, chairman of the Massachusetts
High Technology Council. ``But how many business people in Texas or
California or Illinois or Pennsylvania are really going to care
about that?''
   The council was established in 1977, near the end of Dukakis'
first term as governor, by high tech executives dissatisfied with
Dukakis' record on taxes and economic development. Lobbying
pressure from the influential group led to several economic
development programs that Dukakis now touts on the campaign trail.
Members of the high-tech group also have complained that Dukakis
takes too much credit for the state economy.
   But Foley said the so-called ``Massachusetts miracle'' and
political momentum will attract business officials to Dukakis.
   ``Business and labor and every other constituency will be
anxious to be with a winner,'' Foley said. ``That's human nature.''

   Students hurling firebombs and rocks
attacked a U.S. diplomatic office Monday as thousands of
demonstrators battled riot police for a sixth consecutive day in
the southern city of Kwangju.
   The attack did not damage the single-story U.S. Information
Service building.
   Police said they fired tear gas to thwart the attack by bands of
students shouting anti-U.S. slogans and hurling firebombs at the
building in the provincial city 165 miles south of Seoul.
   At least four policemen were reported injured.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap said police arrested two
protesters who scaled the roof of an annex to the USIS building and
tossed five firebombs that smashed several rooftiles, but caused no
fire.
   A student was seen unfolding an anti-U.S. placard at the top of
a nearby building, while another 100 students surged out of
sidestreets to hurl rocks and about 30 firebombs that exploded
around the gate and walls of the USIS office.
   Also on Monday, groups of students attacked four police stations
in Kwangju, smashing windows and doors before being driven off.
Clashes between police and some 1,000 protesters also broke out in
downtown Kwangju after dark, the agency said.
   The firebomb attack followed demonstrations Monday at Kwangju's
Chonnam University, where police fired barrages of tear gas to stop
about 3,000 students and dissidents trying to march off campus.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Drive out the
Yankees!'' the demonstrators shouted as they called for a full
investigation into the South Korean army's bloody suppression of a
1980 uprising in Kwangju in which about 200 people were killed.
   Thousands of demonstrators have clashed with police in Kwangju
since rallies began Wednesday marking the eighth anniversary of the
uprising.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment has been running high in the recent wave of
protests, with students demanding the removal of all U.S. influence.
   The U.S. government has denied any involvement in the Kwangju
incident, but dissidents contend the United States condoned the
movement of South Korean soldiers to suppress the protests. Under a
mutual defense pact, the United States controls both Korean troops
and 42,000 U.S. soldiers stationed here.
   Last week, protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at the
USIS building in Seoul and hurled home made bombs at the U.S.
Embassy. A policeman and two students were hurt in the incident.
   But other parts of South Korea were reported quiet Monday after
five days of anti-government demonstrations that often turned into
violent clashes with riot police in the streets and on campuses.

<TEXT>
   A rum warehouse converted into a new
Tate Gallery of modern art opens Tuesday as the crown jewel in the
revived waterfront of this economically depressed port city.
   Prince Charles accepted Liverpool's invitation to open the
``Tate of the North,'' a permanent gallery housing more than 200
20th century works of art from London's Tate Gallery.
   ``The prince's visit is symbolic of the turnaround in our
city,'' said Keith Robinson, director of Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce.
   ``We have been hit hard and we are delighted that His Royal
Highness is coming here just as the tide is starting to flow
economically again in Liverpool's direction,'' he said in an
interview.
   The Tate is on 140-year-old Albert Dock in the city that was
founded on American and Caribbean trade in cotton, tobacco, sugar,
rum and African slaves.
   It is named after its Victorian benefactor, sugar cane magnate
Sir Henry Tate, a Liverpudlian whose sugar was imported through the
docks.
   The new northern gallery is the first endeavor by a state museum
in Britain to show its works on a large scale outside the capital
city.
   ``We will change the displays and exhibitions every nine months
and I expect half a million visitors a year,'' said curator Richard
Francis. ``The aim has been to take works out of storage and put
them in a place where they would be of benefit.''
   The first displays include surrealist art such as Salvador
Dali's ``Lobster Telephone,'' British sculpture of the past 20
years and a room of abstract paintings by the late American Mark
Rothko.
   ``I am absolutely delighted at this move,'' said Sir Alan
Bowness, who directs the Tate Gallery holdings of 40,000 works,
representing all British art and international 20th century art.
   ``Our space in London is large enough to show only about 15
percent of our modern art _ because modern art works tend to be big
_ and Liverpool will raise that to 25 percent.''
   The international council of the Museum of Modern Art in New
York visited Liverpool on Saturday to see how the five-story
warehouse of red bricks and stone, supported by cast-iron columns,
was converted at a cost of nearly $14 million by architect James
Stirling.
   ``It was filthy and ruinous when I saw it, with dead pigeons
lying everywhere, the roof collapsed and water pouring in,''
Stirling said. ``I was glad to work on it, as it is perhaps the
most magnificent dock of its type ever built in this country.''
   Said gallery staffer Sarah Hughes, 23: ``My friends here have a
bit of a giggle about modern art, which is an unknown quantity in
Liverpool.''
   ``But there's a great spirit of pride in this city, and not just
because we're the Beatles' hometown. We all want to get involved in
helping it,'' she added.
   Government and business moved to help Liverpool with millions of
pounds in cash grants in 1977 after the decline of the docks,
shipbuilding and automaking.
   Investment expanded after 1981 riots by the unemployed in the
Toxteth district led to one death, 3,000 arrests and streets of
homes and shops set ablaze.
   The city of 476,500 people still has a jobless rate of 25
percent and is having to overcome a history of strikes and leftist
political anarchy on the city council.
   Keynote of the revival is the transformation of the
once-abandoned city center docks along the Mersey river into a
leisure area of museums, shops, offices, apartments and businesses.
   ``The first sign we had that things were changing was one year
ago when employers reported shortages of skilled workers,'' said
Robinson.
   The docks are busy again because European businessmen are
realizing that Liverpool is still the nearest port to the United
States.

<HEAD>Cancer Institute Hopes To Double Number of Patients in Cancer
Experments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Cancer Institute said Monday it
will try to double over the next four years the number of patients
who receive experimental treatments in an effort to speed up the
search for ways to stop the biggest cancer killers.
   Largely because of physicians' reluctance to enroll their
patients in cancer experiments, officials said, it may take 10
years or longer to assess the value of promising new therapies.
   ``We are not getting enrolled anywhere near the number of
patients we need to get answers within a reasonable period of
time,'' Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., director of the cancer
institute, said at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology.
   Currently, about 25,000 cancer patients each year are enrolled
in treatment experiments, known as clinical trials, that are
sponsored by the cancer institute.
   Through appeals to doctors and directly to the public, the
institute hopes to double this by 1992.
   Clinical trials are medicine's primary way of figuring out
whether new drugs and combinations of surgery and radiation are
better than the standard ways of coping with the disease.
Typically, patients are randomly assigned to have the standard
treatment or the new form of therapy.
   Only about 1 percent of patients with colon or breast cancer are
currently enrolled in clinical trials. DeVita said the institute
hopes to increase this to 10 percent.
   The goal is to enroll all the patients who will take part in an
experiment within one year, instead of over three, five or even 10
years, as often now happens. Once patients are enrolled, doctors
must wait five years to see which treatment worked best.
   DeVita said patients are often worried about taking part in
cancer experiments.
   ``The public is confused,'' he said. ``They think they are
guinea pigs, that they will get nothing and we'll just watch their
tumors grow. That's not the case.''
   Instead, DeVita maintained that participants in clinical trials
get the best available treatment, even if they are assigned to the
comparison group that doesn't get the experimental therapy.
   However, experts said that the unwillingness of doctors, not
patients, is the primary obstacle to increasing the number of
patients in clinical trials.
   Dr. Bernard Fisher of the University of Pittsburgh, who has been
conducting clinical trials since the 1950s, said doctors often want
to stick with the style of care they learned in medical school and
are also afraid they will lose control of their patients'
treatments.
   Dr. Robert E. Wittes, head of the cancer institute's Cancer
Therapy Evaluation Program, added, ``The main problem of
participating in trials is that they take time.''
   He said physicians are reluctant to spend time explaining the
treatment trials to their patients and keeping up with the paper
work involved.
   Another study, presented at the conference, suggested that many
doctors believe they already know what kind of treatment is best.
   Dr. Malcolm J. Moore of Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto
surveyed 300 physicians in North American and England who treat
cancer of the bladder, kidneys and prostate gland. Seventy percent
responded that if they had one of these kinds of cancer, they would
not enroll themselves in a clinical trial. Instead, they would
prefer the kind of therapy they already offer their patients.
   Wittes said the cancer institute is trying to appeal to doctors'
sense of public duty.
   ``We are saying, `You will do good for society, and you will do
good for your patients.'''
   Wittes said the cancer institute will concentrate at first in
enrolling more patients in clinical trials of new treatments for
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cancers of the breast, colon, rectum and
bladder.

<TEXT>
   Against a backdrop of nearly 200 police
officers, Gov. William Donald Schaefer signed a law Monday making
Maryland the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as
Saturday Night Specials.
   ``This is the first time a legislature has stood up and said,
`These guns are wrong,''' the governor said. He said the measure is
a step toward stopping ``the senseless killing on our streets.''
   Looking on was White House press secretary James Brady, who was
wounded by a Saturday Night Special in the 1981 assassination
attempt on President Reagan by John W. Hinckley Jr. Brady's wife,
Sarah, had lobbied for the bill.
   ``I'd like to see other states like dominoes fall into line,''
said Brady, who has been in a wheelchair since the shooting.
``Thumbs up for Maryland.''
   ``I can't think of a sweeter, more wonderful day. This is indeed
a great step for public safety,'' said Mrs. Brady.
   In the last 20 years, Saturday Night Specials have been used to
kill 250,000 people and injure 1{ million, she said.
   The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell or
manufacture a Saturday Night Special in Maryland. It will not be
against the law to own such weapons.
   The measure also sets up a nine-member board appointed by the
governor to prepare a list of handguns that may be sold. Weapons
that are easily concealed, inaccurate, unsafe and poorly made will
be banned under the law.
   The bill also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can be
slipped through metal detectors.
   Nearly 200 uniformed police officers from Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia witnessed the
signing in an effort by the governor to demonstrate wide support
among law enforcement agencies.
   Gun owners, backed by the National Rifle Association, already
are collecting signatures to put the law to a vote in a referendum
in November.
   Jim Goss, an NRA official in Washington, said the organization
had no comment on the bill. He referred callers to leaders of the
Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban.
   Fred Griisser, a spokesman for the committe, said he doesn't
have a count on the number of signatures collected so far, but that
he is confident his organization will meet the requirement of
33,044 to put the bill to a vote.
   After that, ``it will be an uphill battle to explain the true
nature of the law to the voters,'' he said.
   Under the law, manufacturers can be fined up to $10,000 and
dealers and gun owners up to $2,500 for each violation. Each time a
gun is made or sold constitutes a separate violation.
   Mrs. Brady, who has been campaigning nationally for tougher gun
laws since her husband was shot, said the Maryland approach solves
the difficult problem of trying to define Saturday Night Specials
by leaving the decision to a review board.
   The board will consist of three citizen members, the
superintendent of state police and one representative each of a
state prosecutors association, the Maryland Association of Chiefs
of Police, Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse, the National Rifle
Association and a Maryland gun manufacturer.
   Other states are interested in the Maryland approach and gun
control groups are gearing up to try to pass similar laws
elsewhere, Mrs. Brady said.

   Against a backdrop of nearly 200 police
officers, Gov. William Donald Schaefer signed a law Monday making
Maryland the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as
Saturday Night Specials.
   ``This is the first time a legislature has stood up and said,
`These guns are wrong,''' the governor said. He said the measure is
a step toward stopping ``the senseless killing on our streets.''
   Looking on was White House press secretary James Brady, who was
wounded by a Saturday Night Special in the 1981 assassination
attempt on President Reagan by John W. Hinckley Jr. Brady's wife,
Sarah, had lobbied for the bill.
   ``I'd like to see other states like dominoes fall into line,''
said Brady, who has been in a wheelchair since the shooting.
``Thumbs up for Maryland.''
   ``I can't think of a sweeter, more wonderful day. This is indeed
a great step for public safety,'' said Mrs. Brady.
   In the last 20 years, Saturday Night Specials have been used to
kill 250,000 people and injure 1{ million, she said.
   The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell or
manufacture a Saturday Night Special in Maryland. It will not be
against the law to own such weapons.
   The measure also sets up a nine-member board appointed by the
governor to prepare a list of handguns that may be sold. Weapons
that are easily concealed, inaccurate, unsafe and poorly made will
be banned under the law.
   The bill also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can be
slipped through metal detectors.
   Nearly 200 uniformed police officers from Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia witnessed the
signing in an effort by the governor to demonstrate wide support
among law enforcement agencies.
   Gun owners, backed by the National Rifle Association, already
are collecting signatures to put the law to a vote in a referendum
in November.
   Jim Goss, an NRA official in Washington, said the organization
had no comment on the bill. He referred callers to leaders of the
Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban.
   Fred Griisser, a spokesman for the committe, said he doesn't
have a count on the number of signatures collected so far, but that
he is confident his organization will meet the requirement of
33,044 to put the bill to a vote.
   After that, ``it will be an uphill battle to explain the true
nature of the law to the voters,'' he said.
   Under the law, manufacturers can be fined up to $10,000 and
dealers and gun owners up to $2,500 for each violation. Each time a
gun is made or sold constitutes a separate violation.
   Mrs. Brady, who has been campaigning nationally for tougher gun
laws since her husband was shot, said the Maryland approach solves
the difficult problem of trying to define Saturday Night Specials
by leaving the decision to a review board.
   The board will consist of three citizen members, the
superintendent of state police and one representative each of a
state prosecutors association, the Maryland Association of Chiefs
of Police, Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse, the National Rifle
Association and a Maryland gun manufacturer.
   Other states are interested in the Maryland approach and gun
control groups are gearing up to try to pass similar laws
elsewhere, Mrs. Brady said.

<HEAD>Scholar Sentenced To Three Years In Prison For Transporting Stolen
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Brooklyn-born art scholar with the air of a
British gentleman was sentenced Monday to three years in prison for
transporting stolen documents belonging to the National Archives
and the Library of Congress.
   Charles Merrill Mount, 60, also was ordered to repay $20,000 to
a Boston bookstore that bought some of the documents.
   Mount predicted he would win an appeal.
   U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel sentenced Mount to two three-year
prison terms, but suspended the second term and instead ordered
Mount to serve five years' probation after his release.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Martin F. Murphy had recommended a total
prison sentence of eight years, while defense attorney Charles
McGinty requested a suspended sentence. Mount, who was convicted
April 11, could have received up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   McGinty asked Monday that Mount be allowed to remain free long
enough to help prepare for a trial in Washington on charges of
possessing federal property. Ms. Zobel ordered Mount taken into
custody pending her decision on the request.
   Before the sentence was read, Mount professed his innocence in a
rambling 35-minute speech to Ms. Zobel about how he was the victim
of libel and plagiarism by envious historians.
   Ms. Zobel told Mount: ``You continue to proclaim your innocence.
However, the jury did not believe your testimony. ... You stole
those documents from us all. Those documents belong to the national
heritage.''
   An art historian and a Guggenheim Foundation fellow at the age
of 26, Mount was accused of selling letters by James McNeill
Whistler, Winston Churchill and Henry James that belonged to the
Library of Congress. Last July he sold the letters to Goodspeed's
Book Shop, a Boston dealer of rare books and documents.
   A month later, FBI agents arrested the dapper historian at the
bookshop while he tried to sell letters and papers bearing the
signatures of Abraham Lincoln and Civil War generals. The documents
were taken from the National Archives.
   Murphy said the documents had been stored in Massachusetts
during the trial but will be returned to the institutions in
Washington.
   Mount claimed the documents belonged to him for years and that
he showed them to two Irish men while living in Dublin in the 1960s.
   But his legal troubles left him broke and he couldn't afford to
bring the witnesses to his trial, he said. The federal government
seized his $18,400 in savings after his arrest. That money will now
go to repay Goodspeed's.
   During his three-week trial, Mount protested that he wasn't
being allowed to present his side of the case. He claimed he was
being railroaded because the government would not pay to bring the
witnesses from Ireland.
   Despite having a British-sounding accent, Mount started in life
as Sherman Merrill Suchow of Brooklyn, N.Y. He changed his name in
the 1950s.

<HEAD>New Rules Proposed for Liability When Carcasses Condemned for
Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed change in federal regulations would
hold farmers and others in the marketing chain financially
accountable for livestock carcasses condemned at slaughter plants
because of illegally high traces of drugs, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   B.H. ``Bill'' Jones, administrator of the department's Packers
and Stockyards Administration, said the proposal is intended to
deter the sale of medicated aniamls for slaughter and shift
economic responsibility for illegal drug residues from the meat
packer to those who cause the violation.
   Under the proposal, a meat packer would be able to ``bill back''
the person from whom the livestock was bought if it is condemned
because of illegal drug residues.
   In order to make the plan work, Jones said, each purchaser or
selling agency in the marketing chain would be permitted to use the
bill-back procedure. If a seller failed to settle up, the buyer or
selling agency would be permitted to deduct from a subsequent
purchase from the same person.
   Jones said that although a small percentage of livestock
producers are selling medicated animals for slaughter, the
illegally high drug residues continue to be a problem, notably in
swine, culled dairy cows and young calves.
   The proposal will be open 60 days for public comment. Those can
be sent to: Packers and Stockyards Administration, Room 3039-S,
USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

   An escaped inmate accompanied by his
stepdaughter and the wife he married while in prison remained at
large Monday and may be driving a Cadillac rented by his wife,
authorities said.
   Michael Day, 31, of Athens, took two guards hostage at gunpoint
and escaped Sunday in a prison jeep, said spokesman Robert Prosser
of the medium-security Ross Correctional Institute.
   Day and the two guards then went to a Holiday Inn where his wife
was waiting with a getaway car. The woman was accompanied by her
9-year-old daughter, Prosser said Monday.
   Day left one guard handcuffed to the jeep's steering wheel and
the other to a towel bar in a room registered to Day's wife, Sylvia
Caraveo Day.
   Prosser said the guard in the hotel room freed himself in time
to watch from a window as the Days got into a silver Nissan.
   Authorities found that car abandoned here and believe Mrs. Day
rented a Cadillac from Avis at the Columbus airport. They said Day
had paid a man they refused to identify to drive them to Columbus.
   ``At this point, we have an all-points bulletin out throughout
Ohio and in surrounding states,'' Prosser said Monday. ``We're
pursuing some leads, but I can't comment on them.''
   Prosser could not say what type of gun was used in the escape,
but said authorities ``are working on the assumption it's the same
gun he has now.'' He said the gun apparently came from a source
outside the prison.
   ``It was an obvious breach of security and we're very concerned
about that,'' Prosser said.
   Prison spokeswoman Sandy Price said patrol officials and prison
Superintendent Gary Mohr questioned the two guards late Sunday
night. The guards' names were not released.
   Day was convicted of attempted abduction, burglary, receiving
stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon after a felony
conviction, Ms. Price said. He had been at the Ross prison since
June 1987 and had served at the Chillicothe Correctional Institute
and Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield since April 1985.
   Prosser said Day got married while he was in prison.

<TEXT>
   The paralyzed woman whose right-to-die court
fight set a precedent says she temporarily has abandoned plans to
starve herself to death.
   Frail, bedridden Elizabeth Bouvia said she still wants her life
to end, but added in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:
   ``If I tried to starve myself, I would be publicly shunned.
Starving myself would take too long. I wish there was a quicker
way.''
   The 30-year-old former social worker, crippled by cerebral
palsy, lives in reclusion at Los Angeles County-University of
Southern California Medical Center, where she passes her time
watching television and smoking 1{ packs of cigarettes a day.
   Weighing 90 pounds, up from 68, Ms. Bouvia said she eats at
least one meal a day.
   She is registered at the hospital as a Jane Doe and lives in one
of the hospital's few isolation rooms. She has left the room six
times in the last two years _ once to see a dentist, the other
times to make telephone calls.
   She said she last tried to starve herself in January 1987, but
gave up when she learned she would have to endure several painful
weeks before dying.
   Her 1986 court battles against hospitals where doctors force-fed
her rather than allow her to die established case law defending
patients' rights to control medical treatment, regardless of age,
health or motives.
   She has visitors about once a week, and her family in Oregon
travels south to see her a few times a year, she said.
   Nonetheless, she abhors her condition.
   ``The thought of being here another 10 years, I just can't
fathom,'' she said. ``I would rather die than live here.''

   A Navy and Coast Guard review began
Monday of proposed changes in an air-sea rescue training program
suspended since the March 2 drowning of a recruit.
   Six sailors accused in the drowning also face a public hearing
Wednesday as Navy officials denied charges by the man's family that
they were slow to investigate his death. Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died while allegedly held in the
pool by instructors.
   The review of recommended changes at the Rescue Swimmer School
is closed to the public, said Lt. Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, a spokesman
for Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman.
   The school at the Pensacola Naval Air Station had a 40 percent
attrition rate and already was under study prior to the death, said
Thunman, chief of naval education and training. He added that such
high rates often mean ``we haven't put the right people there and
we haven't prepared them properly for training.''
   Mirecki died after instructors allegedly dragged him into a pool
against his will and held his head under water after he failed a
drill.
   Other recruits reportedly were told to turn their backs to the
pool and sing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as loudly as they could
to drown out Mirecki's screams for help.
   Family members say they were told Mirecki's death was an
accident, and Navy records in Washington initially attributed his
death to natural causes. They complain that they had to wait two
months before getting any official word on how he died.
   The five instructors were charged with involuntary manslaughter
and conspiracy to commit battery. Their commanding officer was
charged with dereliction of duty.
   The Wednesday hearing is the military's equivalent to a grand
jury inquiry, though some differences exist, including it being
open to the public.
   Lt. Lee Saunders, a public affairs officer, said portions of the
hearing might be closed for legal reasons, however.
   The presiding officer, Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio of the Naval
Legal Service Office in Philadelphia, will recommend whether the
charges should go to court-martial, be dismissed or handled through
non-judicial penalties.
   The accused sailors could be dismissed from the service if they
are found guilty at a court-martial. Those charged with involuntary
manslaughter also could be imprisoned up three years. Their
commander could face three months.

   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, the real-life
mother of Baby M, says she's not impressed with the television film
about her groundbreaking surrogate motherhood.
   ``I think the only truth in the whole thing ... was my dog and
the nine puppies,'' said Whitehead-Gould, who was in Washington on
Monday to join in a call to end commercialized surrogate parenting.
   She said she saw only the second hour of the film, broadcast
Sunday on the ABC network. The movie, ``Baby M,'' was to conclude
Monday night.
   She called the film a ``whitewashed'' depiction of the surrogate
agreement and ensuing battle in New Jersey courts that made her the
nation's best-known surrogate.
   She said she was particularly upset by the film's shallow
portrayal of her ex-husband, Richard Whitehead.
   The Whiteheads were divorced this year, and Mary Beth Whitehead
married Dean Gould. The couple had a child earlier this month.
   Whitehead-Gould gained fame after she refused to surrender her
infant daughter to its biological father, William Stern, also of
New Jersey.
   Stern and his wife sued, and a New Jersey state court last year
upheld the contract under which Whitehead-Gould accepted a $10,000
fee to bear Stern's child.
   The contract was voided in February by the state Supreme Court,
although the court let the Stern's keep the child they named
Melissa. Whitehead-Gould has visitation rights.
   The made-for-television film stars JoBeth Williams as
Whitehead-Gould. The film, based entirely on court records, was
made without the cooperation of Whitehead-Gould or the Sterns.

<TEXT>
   Britain on Monday welcomed the first Soviet
delegation to visit a chemical warfare facility in Western Europe.
   Thirteen Soviet scientists and military experts will spend three
days inspecting Britain's chemical warfare defense center and
related facilities in southwestern England and talking with British
chemical weapons experts.
   Britain stopped making chemical weapons in the 1950s and
destroyed its stockpiles in 1957.
   The Ministry of Defense said it will be the first exchange visit
on chemical weapons between the Soviet Union and a Western European
country.
   ``It is intended that the full range of chemical warfare-related
issues should be discussed ... including production, assessment of
the chemical warfare hazards, storage, trials, detection,
protection, monitoring, decontamination, medical countermeasures
and disposal,'' said Ian Stewart, minister of state for the Armed
Forces.
   The visiting delegation is led by Yuri Nazarkin, the chief
Soviet negotiatior at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament and
includes Maj. Gen. R.F. Razuvanov, commander of the Soviet chemical
establishment in Shikhany, located on the Volga in eastern Russia.
   The Soviets will visit the Chemical Warfare Defense Center at
Porton Down, which sprawls across 7,000 acres on Salisbury plain
near the ancient Stonehenge monument, about 80 miles southwest of
London.
   Since Britain's stockpiles have been destroyed, Porton Down now
does only defensive work, making protective equipment such as gas
masks, clothing and monitoring instruments for the armed forces and
developing antidotes to chemical weapons.
   The Soviets also will visit the nearby Public Health Laboratory
Service Center, where applied microbiological research is
conducted, and the United Kingdom Defense Nuclear Biological and
Chemical Center, where instructors are trained to use defensive
equipment to counter chemical weapons.
   In return, British scientists will in July visit the Soviet
chemical warfare facility in Shikhany.
   Britain proposed the exchange in 1986, before the Soviets
acknowledged that they possess chemical weapons.
   In early 1987, the Soviets conceded they have a chemical weapons
stockpile amounting to 50,000 tons and accepted the British
invitation later that year. Western estimates, however, put the
Soviet stockpile at 300,000 tons _ the largest in the world.
   Britain, which has been in the forefront of negotiations to
achieve a worldwide ban on chemical weapons, said last week that
such a ban, as well as reductions in conventional forces, must come
before any further negotiations on cutting nuclear weapons in
Europe.
   The United States, the only other country that acknowledges
possessing chemical weapons, ended an 18-year moratorium on their
manufacture in December and has an estimated stockpile of 30,000
tons.
   The massive Soviet stockpile has been a major stumbling block at
the 40-nation Geneva Conference. A 1925 Geneva protocol bans the
use of chemical arms.

Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An additional 3,375,367 acres of highly
erodible cropland will be taken from production under the 10-year
Conservation Reserve Program, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   Milton Hertz, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Program, said the acreage was
accepted from offers, or bids, during the program's sixth signup
held Feb. 1-19. A total of about 4.5 million acres was offered
during the signup.
   In all, counting the earlier signups, more than 25.5 million
acres have been accepted into the program, he said. Another signup
will be held July 18 through Aug. 5.
   Congress in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45
million acres for the program by 1990.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production
for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, they get annual
rental payments from the government and one-time assistance pay for
half the cost of planting grass, trees and shrubs to guard against
erosion.
   Hertz said the bids accepted from the latest signup averaged
$47.90 per acre annually, compared with $48.45 for the first five
signups.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers in London and Toronto reported that U.S. intelligence
has discovered a North Korean terrorist plot to force cancellation
of the Olympic Games scheduled for September in South Korea.
   A front-page Washington dispatch by Charles Ashman in the Sunday
Express gave no attribution for the reported plot, in which
Japanese terrorists would attack British, French and American
airlines in order to frighten people away from the Olympics.
   It said the arrest earlier this year of Japanese terrorists
trained in communist North Korea led to an investigation that
revealed the plot. It did not say where the terrorists were
arrested.
   In Canada, a similar report Sunday in the Toronto Sun said the
plan called for attacks on targets of Air Canada, TWA, British
Airways and Air France. The dispatch from Washington quoted
unidentified CIA and military sources.
   According to the Sun, attacks were to be made over six weeks on
aircraft and airline facilities in New York, Toronto, London,
Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
administration has no evidence to support the stories.
   Other officials said privately the U.S. ambassador in charge of
the office of combating terrorism, L. Paul Bremer, had no
recollection of having talked with the Toronto Sun even though he
was cited as a source for the story.
   The Sunday Express said Kim Jong Il, son of North Korean leader
Kim Il Sung, persuaded his father to enlist Japanese terrorists,
many of them trained in North Korea, in the ``campaign of terror''
against the South.

<HEAD>80,000 Peasants March on Half Dozen Colombian Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 80,000 peasants marched on
a half dozen Colombian cities Monday, demanding land,
nationalization of foreign oil companies and an end to what they
call the army's ``dirty war'' against them.
   The military said leftist guerrillas organized the protests.
   There have been 20 peasant marches in Colombia in the last year.
This is the first time the protests were aimed at foreign oil
companies.
   There are approximately 30 such companies here.
   Newspapers and radio chains with reporters accompanying the
peasants estimated the total number of protesters as about 80,000.
   In Bogota, the capital, troops occupied Colombia's national
university after the rector, Marco Palacio, said young people with
guns organized protests that led to cars being stoned and to
university property being destroyed.
   Peasants marched on the northern cities of Barranquilla,
Cartagena, Santa Marta and Valledupar, on Bucaramanga in the east
and on Barrancabermeja in central Colombia.
   In another development, guerrillas of the National Liberation
Army threw a bomb and hijacked a bus in the northwest city of
Medellin, police there reported.
   A police release said little damage was caused by the bomb
explosion Sunday night at the Medellin headquarters of a banana
plantation owners' association.
   Banana growers and banana pickers have been at odds for months.
Right-wing death squads have killed 95 workers. The National
Liberation Army, known as the ELN, has killed 10 workers believed
to be army informants.
   ELN guerrillas hijacked a busload of workers in Medellin on
Monday, but freed everyone and fled after harranguing the
passengers, the police said.
   Defense Minister Gen. Rafael Samudio Molina said in an interview
with the radio chain RCN that Monday's peasant protests were
organized by the ELN.
   The ELN demands that foreign oil companies get out of Colombia
and that the government nationalize their holdings.
   The guerrilla group has bombed the country's main oil pipeline
two dozen times this year.
   The line runs 500 miles from Bogota's biggest oil field, on the
Venezuelan border in northern Arauca province, to the Caribbean
port of Covenas.
   As in past protests, the peasants claimed that the army is
behind death squads that have killed hundreds of people in the last
two years.
   Death squads killed about 800 members of a leftist party, the
Patriotic Union, during that time. In the last two months, death
squads killed more than 150 peasants, including those in the
banana-growing regions, for alleged sympathy with leftist
guerrillas.

   An armed hijacker commandeered a
Colombian jetliner today and diverted it to Panama then Aruba after
freeing 131 people, authorities said.
   Colombian Civil Aeronautics chief Yezid Castano said the
hijacker was demanding $100,000. Castano said the man claimed to
have a fatal disease and wanted to live out his days in Cuba.
   The plane landed at Reina Beatrix International Airport in
Oranjestad, Aruba this afternoon, said an American Airlines
employee there.
   ``The plane is here at this moment,'' the employee said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There are police at the
airport. No one is being allowed near the plane.''
   Nilka Vergara, spokeswoman at Omar Torrijos International
Airport, said the aircraft was fueled after a three-hour stop in
Panama.
   Airport administrator Eduardo Guerrero said the lone male
hijacker carried two hand grenades and at least one pistol and was
holding the pilot, co-pilot and a flight engineer hostage.
   There were no passengers on board.
   Speaking to reporters, Guerrero called the man ``desquiciado'' _
Spanish for mentally unbalanced _ and said a special negotiating
team that talked with him on a ground-crew intercom could not learn
his identity, nationality or what he wants.
   Castano initially said 135 people were let of the plane in
Medellin, but later revised the figure to 131 people, including
three flight attendants.
   The hijacker forced the airliner's crew to cut off
communications with the airport control tower after the plane
landed in Panama, Guerrero said. But he said a three-man
negotiating team walked up to the plane and spoke through the
intercom.
   Guerrero said the negotiating team was made up of Panamanian Air
Force Capt. Miguel von Siedlitz, chief of security at the airport;
Luis Rossi, director of all Panamanian airports; and Maj. Fitz
Gibson of the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   He said a special Defense Force team was deployed around the
plane. Soldiers could be seen in ditches about 80 yards from the
jet.
   The Avianca jet took off from the Colombian city of Medellin
this morning on a flight to Bogota, about 200 miles to the
southeast, and was hijacked, the security chief of Colombia's Civil
Aeronautics Administration told the radio network Caracol.
   Capt. Edgard Lozano told the radio in Bogota that the plane was
forced back to Medellin, where 129 passengers and six flight
attendants were freed.
   The Boeing 727 then took off for Panama, where it landed at the
international airport outside Panama City and taxiied to a stop on
the grass next to an isolated runway. Reporters and most officials
were kept about 600 yards away.
   In Medellin, several passengers spoke to radio Caracol.
``Everything happened very fast, but there was no panic,'' said one
passenger, Luis Fernando Piedrahita.
   He said the hijacker was a young man. The hijacker carried a
briefcase that he said contained hand grenades, Piedrahita said.
   Another passanger, Javier Robledo, said he was sitting next to
the hijacker.
   The young man gave a note to a flight attendant and she led him
to cockpit, Robledo told Caracol.
   ``Both the hijacker and the flight attendant were very
nervous,'' Robledo said. ``Nothing happened, and 10 minutes after
going back to the airport the pilot told everyone they should get
off the plane.''

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Exports to Soviet Union Expected To Rise Sharply This
Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of U.S. agricultural exports to the
Soviet Union this year is expected to be at a three-year high of
$1.4 billion, up 50 percent from $938 million in calendar 1987, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   ``Behind the gain will be much larger wheat shipments at higher
prices and much bigger soybean and soybean meal sales,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   Farm product sales to the Soviets exceeded $1.9 billion in 1985
but plummeted to a 13-year-low of $658 million in 1986 before
starting their rebound.
   A major factor has been large sales of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program.
   ``The U.S. value share of Soviet grain imports may be above 30
percent for the first time since 1984 and (may comprise) over 8
percent of total agricultural imports,'' the report said.
   Although total Soviet agricultural imports may increase 5
percent in 1988 from last year's estimated $16 billion, the value
still will be below the $19 billion average during the first half
of the 1980s.
   ``Grain imports now cost about $3 billion a year instead of $7
billion as in 1981-85,'' the report said. Despite a possible 20
percent rise in the per-ton cost of imported grain in 1988, this
``unit value'' will still be around one-third lower in the early
1980s.
   Earlier this month, the USDA forecast 1988 Soviet grain output
at 215 million metric tons, up 2 percent from last year. It also
would be the third consecutive harvest of more than 200 millon
tons, a historic first for the Soviet Union.
   ``Crops are off to a much better start than in 1987 following a
good fall sowing, overwintering and spring planting conditions,''
Monday's analysis said. ``Barring unusually severe weather through
the spring and fall, 1988 crop output should increase.''

   It will take up to two months to complete the
trial of a professor accused of the chain saw murder of a teen-age
male prostitute whose body parts were scattered across the state,
potential jurors were told Monday.
   Max Bernard Franc, 58, who taught political science at Fresno
State University but maintained an apartment in West Hollywood, has
denied killing the 18-year-old runaway, blaming a man who has never
been found.
   The trial is expected to offer insight into the plight of young
runaways in the West Hollywood gay community.
   Superior Court Judge John H. Reid told 70 prospective jurors
Franc's trial could last as long as eight weeks.
   ``Some have referred to this as the chain saw case,'' the judge
told the prospects and informed them that body parts had been found
in various locations in California.
   He instructed them not to read anything further about the case.
   The victim, Tracy Leroy Nute, of Kansas City, Mo., was 18 when
he died on Aug. 20. He had left home the previous February, telling
his mother that he was headed for California to become a movie star.
   After his arrival, he bleached his dark hair blond and wore it
in spikes. Counselors in the gay community said Nute turned to them
for help after his dreams of stardom faded and he wound up working
as a homosexual prostitute.
   Franc, a bespectacled professor originally from De Pere, Wis.,
was arrested Aug. 29 after he returned a chain saw to a West
Hollywood rental company with bits of flesh and blood in its inner
workings.
   Police alleged that the saw was used to cut up Nute's body,
which was found in pieces scattered across a 200-mile area. Some
parts of the body were never found.
   In early interviews with police, Franc claimed that Nute was
murdered by another man, Terry Adams, but no such person was ever
located and a prosecutor contends the man was invented by Franc.
   If convicted, Franc could face life imprisonment.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has decided
to allow an Ohio zoo to begin exhibiting two giant pandas on loan
from China while zoo officials work to produce the required export
papers, the service said Monday.
   Last week, the agency said the Toledo Zoo would not be allowed
to display the pandas until it could provide the original export
permit. The zoo, which has scheduled to open the panda exhibit
Tuesday, was given 10 days to come up with the documentation.
   However, USFWS spokesman David Klinger said Monday that lawyers
for the zoo gave the service a copy of the Chinese export permit
over the weekend and appear to be making a good-faith effort to
deliver the original document.
   ``We're not going to stand in the way of them opening their
exhibit this week,'' Klinger said. ``They appear to be making an
effort to deliver the documents. We'll accept that in good faith
from them as a first step. We'll allow them to open as they want.''
   However, Klinger said the zoo still will be required to provide
the originals by May 29. Zoo officials have said they have a
representative in China working on getting the documents to the
service.
   Zoo spokeswoman Patty Napierala confirmed that the zoo had
gotten the green light to open the exhibit and plans to do so at
noon Tuesday.
   The zoo has spent nearly $3 million in preparing to exhibit the
pandas as part of Toledo's 150th anniversary celebration.
   In a bid to stop the exhibit, the World Wildlife Fund filed suit
against the wildlife service, arguing that the exhibit would
violate an international convention that bars trafficking in
endangered species for commercial purposes.
   Klinger said Toledo Zoo officials had sought unsuccessfully to
be exempted from the convention on endangered species and had filed
an exemption form with the service instead of the full export
permit as required.
   When the pandas arrived in Chicago on May 13, the paperwork had
not been corrected. Klinger said the service decided it would be
best for the pandas to allow them to go on to Toledo and to take up
the issue later.

   A coalition raising money for New Orleans'
share of Republican National Convention costs has picked up nearly
$450,000 in less than two weeks, a fund-raiser said Monday.
   ``More than $448,000 has been raised since May 11 in pledges and
contributions,'' said Ron Jones, president of the Louisiana
Business Council.
   That means the city still has about $3.3 million to go in its
effort to cover $5.5 million in estimated expenses for the GOP
convention Aug. 15-18 in the Louisiana Superdome, he said.
   Jones predicted the New Orleans Special Events Fund will have
all but about $1 million by mid-July.
   Two weeks ago, the head of the money-raising effort, oilman
Patrick Taylor, said the job was too big for one man and that
donations were trickling in at a disappointing rate.
   Jones, Jim Bob Moffett, president of the New Orleans Chamber of
Commerce, and Mervin Trail, president of the New Orleans Tourist
Commission, then announced they would join the fund drive.
   At a news conference Monday, 85 days before the convention,
Trail also responded to reports that some Republican organizers
were unhappy with the availability and quality of hotel rooms being
offered for the convention.
   The Republican National Committee has not defined a first-class
hotel room for local coordinators, Trail said. But he said he will
meet with RNC officials on Wednesday to work out any problems with
accommodations.
   Jones also spoke of community plans to prepare the city for the
convention.
   ``Between July 4 and Aug. 15, you can expect the city of New
Orleans to be covered in red, white and blue,'' he said.

   An 18-year-old from Toronto, Canada, captured
first place in the 17th U.S.A. Mathematical Olympiad, a math
association said Monday.
   It was the third time that Ravi D. Vakil, a 12th grader from
Martingrove Collegiate Institute in Toronto, has won a medal in the
American math competition that is open to U.S. and Canadian
residents.
   Second place went to Jordan S. Ellenberg, 16, a junior at
Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Md., who won a gold medal
in last summer's International Mathematical Olympiad in Cuba.
   The Mathematical Association of America said the other top
finishers, in order, were: Tal N. Kubo, 18, an Israeli-born senior
at Brookline High School in Massachusetts; Joshua B. Fischman, 15,
a sophomore at Montgomery Blair High School in Bethesda, Md., and
Hubert L. Bray, 17, a senior at Westbury High School in Houston,
who tied for fourth; Nhat Nguyen, 15, a native of Vietnam who is a
ninth grader at Columbus Academy in Columbus, Ohio; and Eric K.
Wepsic, 18, a senior at Boston Latin School in Boston, and David M.
Patrick, 16, a senior at Batavia High School in New York, who tied
for seventh.
   The eight medalists topped a field of 145 students who competed
in the U.S.A. Mathematical Olympiad. They were the top performers
in an earlier exam taken by more than 389,000 students in the
United States and Canada in March and a subsequent tougher exam
taken by more than 1,000 students.
   Wepsic, like Ellenberg, also won a gold medal at last summer's
International Olympiad.
   The eight students will be feted at a dinner at the State
Department on June 7. The American medalists and 16 others will
then spend a month in training at the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, before a team of six U.S. students is chosen to compete
in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Canberra, Australia,
July 9-21.
   Vakil was expected to compete in Canberra for Canada.

   Members of Congress and family members on
Monday urged the Soviet Union to allow mathematician Benjamin
Charny to emigrate to the United States for medical resons.
   ``The reason they refuse to let him go is ludicrous,'' said
Charney's daughter, Ann Charny-Blank of Brookline, Mass. Officially
Charny is being denied emigration because of work he did 17 years
ago on the Soviets' rocket re-entry system, she said.
   Charney, 50, has a serious heart condition which cardiologists
in the Soviet Union say make removal of two tumors on his neck and
thyroid gland too risky, she said. Western physicians who examined
Charny said the necessary surgery would be routine if conducted in
the West.
   The tumor on Charney's neck, which reportedly doubles in size
every few months, is now 3.5 inches in diameter and threatens to
block nerves and arteries to the brain, Mrs. Charny-Blank said at a
news conference.
   Noting the move to sign a U.S.-Soviet agreement on a joint
mission to Mars as ``a sign of trust,'' Mrs. Charny-Blank said ``it
is especially ridiculous under these circumstances to claim that my
father's work is still secret.''
   ``It looks as if the Soviets are planning to fly to Mars,
together with the Americans but return separately, since they still
consider the work of my father on the return (to Earth) to be a
secret,'' she said.
   ``I cannot understand it,'' she said. ``My only hope is that
with this coming summit, responding to all the indignation of
people in America and all over the world during the summit (that)
my father's case will finally be resolved and this race against
time will finally be over.''
   Mrs. Charny-Blank, who was allowed to emmigrate with her husband
and daughter last fall, was joined at the news conference by Reps.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Louis Stokes, D-Ohio.
   A group of children from nearby Falls Church, Va., presented
part of 15,000 letters from American schoolchildren and one signed
by more than 100 members of Congress on Charny's behalf.
   Reps. Frank and Stokes said the Reagan administration had been
supportive of Charny's bid for emigration, but they noted the
Soviets had the last word.
   ``It has been our experience that often they won't tell you a
thing,'' Frank said. ``But if you keep trying and you keep talking,
it does have an effect.''
   Frank and Mrs. Charny-Blank met with the Soviet counsel general
later Monday to discuss her father's case.
   Following the 30-minute meeting, Mrs. Charny-Blank said the
general counsel `` told me he wished he didn't have to discuss
these cases because it was not his decision (to make), but he would
send the information to Moscow as soon as possible.
   ``He didn't say this, but I think the situation makes them
uncomfortable,'' she said.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Effects New Extending Into Streams in Mid-Atlantic
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acid rain probably has acidified a small
number of streams in the mid-Atlantic states where surface waters
previously had not been proven vulnerable, according to an
unreleased study by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Four percent of the stream mileage sampled in 1985 and 1986 in
mid-Atlantic areas was acidic and showed chemical characteristics
that made it unlikely all the acidity could have come from natural
sources, the study concluded. On forested ridges inland from
coastal lowlands, the proportion reached 10 percent.
   ``The lack of plausible sources of neutral salts in these
streams makes it likely'' that their acidity is ``probably
associated with atmospheric acid deposition,'' said the study made
available by the agency on Monday.
   More than a quarter of the stream mileage showing these chemical
characteristics in EPA's study of eastern streams was outside the
mid-Atlantic, but most of that was in Florida where streams are
often naturally acidic. There was practically no such mileage in
the Southeast or the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma.
   Courtney Riordan, head of acid rain research for EPA, said the
new findings show there has been ``an expansion of the geographic
area'' known to be influenced by acid rain.
   What the study could not show is definite proof that acid rain
has acidified the streams in question, how fast stream acidity and
acid-neutralizing ability is changing or when it is likely the
watershed no longer will be able to neutralize the acidity
naturally. EPA hopes to be able to answer such questions next year.
   The mid-Atlantic area in the study was made up of rural areas of
most of Virginia and Pennsylvania, all of Maryland, Delaware and
New Jersey, the eastern half of West Virginia and the Catskill
Mountains of New York.
   An acidic stream was defined as one that had lost all ability to
neutralize further inputs of acidity.
   Some of the heaviest deposition of acidity in rain and snow was
found in southern and southwestern Pennsylvania, northeastern West
Virginia and the Maryland panhandle.
   These areas and their robust soils, believed to have plenty of
ability to neutralize acid rain, have not attracted the attention
of areas with somewhat less acidity in the rain but more vulnerable
watersheds like parts of New England, the Adirondack Mountains of
New York and eastern Canada.
   Most of the acidity in rain, snow and fog in the area is
believed to originate in emissions from smokestacks of coal-fired
power plants in the area and also upwind in the Midwest. Sulfur
dioxide in the smokestack gases is transformed in the atmosphere
into sulfuric acid which is washed out in precipitation.
   The more acidic the water, the less fish life it can support,
and too much acidity means no fish can live there _ what
environmentalists say has happened in many lakes in the Northeast
and eastern Canada.
   There are several sources of sulfates, and the sampling scheme
excluded streams that were likely to have been influenced by
sources in urban pollution or mine runoff.
   About one-third of the 4 percent of stream mileage in question
``had chemistry influenced but not dominated'' by organic compounds
originating in the soil, and most of these stream segments were
located in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey or were headwaters of
streams in the relatively flat glaciated soils of Pennsylvania and
New York.
   ``Historic data suggests that streams in the Pine Barrens may
have been naturally acidic at least since the early 1900s,'' the
study said. ``There is no reason, however, to believe that most of
the upland forested reaches have always been acidic.''
   Overall, the study concluded that 2.7 percent of the stream
mileage sampled was acidic, including 12 percent of the Florida
streams.

   American envoy Vernon Walters said Monday the
United States will continue pushing for an arms embargo on Iran
unless it accepts a U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire in the
war with Iraq.
   Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spoke to
reporters before flying to Oman, the fifth stop on a tour that also
has taken him to Israel, Syria and Iraq.
   Omani officials would not comment on the purpose of the visit,
saying only that it would last two days and they would discuss
U.N.-related issues.
   In Kuwait, the ambassador praised the government's refusal to
free convicted terrorists despite pressures that included the
hijacking of a Kuwait Airways jumbo jet and the killing of two
passengers.
   The release of 17 jailed terrorists convicted of bombing the
U.S. and French embassies in 1983 was the hijackers' only demand
during the 16-day hijack last month. Kuwait refused to free them
and the hijackers surrendered the plane in Algiers in return for
safe conduct.
   Release of the 17 also has been the main demand of pro-Iranian
Shiite Mosleh`fxtremists holding nine American hostages in Lebanon.
   Walters met with Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber Ahmed Sabah; Crown
Prince Saad Abdullah Sabah, and Rashed Abdel-Aziz Rashed, minister
of state for Cabinet affairs.
   Asked whether he and the Kuwaitis discussed the hijacking and
several terrorist bombings in the sheikdom, he said: ``The United
States thinks that the Kuwaiti government demonstrated great
courage during the recent hijacking.
   ``We are not here to make a deal about terrorists and in no way
will the United States ever bring any kind of pressure on the
Kuwaiti government,'' he said in reference to the hostages in
Lebanon.
   Asked about Security Council measure of last July 20 calling for
a truce in the Iran-Iraq war, which began in SeptMm|er 1980,
Walters said Resolution 598 was ``unanimously approved and it's
binding on every member of the United Nations.''
   ``The United States will never abandon its support of 598 and
will work ... and urge our friends to support a second resolution
and an arms embargo on Iran'' if it does not accept the resolution,
he said.
   Iraq has said it will accept the resolution, but only if Iran
does.
   Iran says Iraq must be declared the aggressor before there can
be a cease-fire. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several
border skirmishes.

<HEAD>Denies Israel Helped Develop Missile China Sold to Saudis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday denied
an American newspaper report that Israel helped develop
surface-to-surface missiles that China sold to Saudi Arabia.
   The report in the Washington Post quoted U.S. commercial sources
and Saudi experts as saying Israeli scientists refined the guidance
system used in China's medium-range CSS-2 missile.
   It became known two months ago that Saudi Arabia had bought and
deployed CSS-2s, which have a range of 2,200 miles and could reach
any target in Israel.
   Washington did not known of the deal in advance and could not
persuade the Saudis to cancel it.
   Rabin said on Israel radio: ``Israelis were never partners in .
.. the transfer of technology or anything related to
ground-to-ground missiles to China. If anyone ... is looking for an
alibi about how the United States was taken by surprise by a
friendly nation, Saudi Arabia ... and is trying to pin the blame on
Israel, let him look elsewhere.''
   Saudi leaders told the United States they bought the missiles to
defend themselves against Iran and pledged not to launch them at
Israel.
   In March, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir hinted that
Israel might attack and destroy the missiles.
   Israel and China do not have diplomatic relations but there have
been reports of increasing agricultural and business links between
the two nations.
   An Israeli newspaper said last July a joint company had been
formed to help China with agricultural and technological projects.
The Sunday Times of London said Israel was sending technicians to
modernize Soviet tanks and heavy artillery used by the Chinese army.

   The federal judge who was gunned down at his
suburban home had ignored warnings from his staff to take his
address out of the phone book, telling them, ``It's fate. ... If
they really want you, they'll find you.''
   The seven-year sexual harassment and job discrimination suit of
Carolee Koster came to District Judge Richard J. Daronco in his
first year on the federal bench. After he ruled against her, her
angered father tracked the judge down and killed him, and then
killed himself a few feet away, officials said.
   The gunman was identified as Charles L. Koster, a retired New
York City police officer.
   ``I knew it was related to this case. It was just a feeling I
had,'' Karen Stefflre, one of Daronco's two law clerks, said
Monday, describing her thoughts when she heard that the judge had
been killed.
   ``I knew as soon as I heard. I knew,'' she said, fighting back
tears during an interview with reporters in Daronco's chambers.
``The only thing that threw me off was that he (the gunman) killed
himself.''
   Ms. Stefflre said she and other members of the judge's staff
urged him to remove his listing in the telephone directory, but he
shrugged it off, saying, ``It's fate. You can't really hide. If
they really want you, they'll find you.''
   Another law clerk, Christopher Forte, said the judge rode public
transportation from Pelham, the affluent Westchester County
community where he lived, to the federal courthouse in lower
Manhattan.
   ``He would talk to anyone,'' said Forte.
   James C. Esposito, deputy assistant director in the FBI's New
York office, said Sunday that Koster left a suicide note expressing
``strong displeasure'' at Daronco's ruling last Thursday dismissing
Carolee Koster's lawsuit.
   On Saturday afternoon, officials said, Koster shot the judge as
Daronco tended his garden and followed him into the house, where
the judge died in his study and Koster killed himself with a shot
to the head.
   Ms. Koster, 38, of Manhattan, sued in 1981 claiming sexual
harassment and salary discrimination by Chase Manhattan Bank, where
she was employed in a management position, and her former boss,
Allan Ross.
   During the seven years of litigation, Daronco, appointed to the
federal bench last June, was the third judge to handle the case.
   Marshall E. Lippman, who represented Ms. Koster from 1983 to
1985, said lawyers for Chase and Ross defended the case
aggressively and numerous pretrial motions were filed by both
sides. At least two changes of lawyers by Ms. Koster added to the
delay, he said.
   Lippman said he withdrew from the case over strategy differences
with Ms. Koster, and she began to represent herself.
   She was communicating directly with the judge and other parties
in the lawsuit, which ``made my job difficult to impossible,'' he
said.
   He said she became impatient with him and the case became
``almost a vendetta against both the bank and Mr. Ross ... almost a
case of justifying her existence, all of the emotional torment that
she had been through.''
   Ms. Stefflre said Ms. Koster twice turned down settlements _
once before trial and once after it started.
   Ms. Koster could not be located by The Associated Press for
comment Monday, and her Manhattan phone number is unlisted, but the
New York Post reported she said she had turned down a $300,000
settlement.
   ``I refused, but today I'm sorry I didn't say yes,'' she
reportedly said.
   A spokesman for Chase Manhattan, Fraser Seitel, said, ``We won't
have any comment on that. It is not unusual in a situation where
protracted litigation may result to discuss settlement.''
   Ms. Koster told the newspaper her father believed the judge was
biased against her.
   ``I still love my father,'' she said. ``I'm sorry about what
happened, but I believe he thought he was doing something out of
love, too.''
   Koster, a security guard from 1971 to 1981 at the Chase
Manhattan branch where his daughter worked, spent much of his life
savings on the case, the FBI official said.
   ``The Koster family was totally consumed with this case and it
had become a crusade in their lives,'' Esposito said.

   Israel opened the West
Bank's Arab schools Monday for the first time in nearly four months
and 200,000 youngsters returned to classes. Palestinian leaders
called it a ``glorious victory.''
   The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of Mubarak Awad,
an Arab-American advocate of Palestinian civil disobedience who
appealed a government order deporting him.
   Military officials said schools were opened because violence had
declined, but three Palestinians were killed Sunday in one one of
the worst days in recent weeks, and a new underground leaflet
called a general strike for Wednesday.
   The army has ``examined'' the education system and ``teachers
who were connected with the rioting are not teachers today,'' Brig.
Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank military administration,
said on army radio.
   Riots began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. At least 194 Arabs have been
killed, and an Israeli soldier and Jewish settler also have been
slain.
   Olivier Rafowicz, spokesman for the military government, said
612 West Bank elementary schools and kindergartens were reopened
Monday for 203,000 students and ``everything went really well. Over
90 percent of students and all the teachers showed up for classes.''
   High schools will be reopened next week if conditions remain
peaceful, he said.
   Authorities closed 1,200 schools in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
early in February, affecting about 475,000 Palestinian students.
Schools in Gaza have operated sporadically since, but those in the
West Bank remained closed.
   Awad, 44, has been in jail since May 5. He said he will use
whatever means necessary to return if he is deported _ including
conversion to Judaism, which would allow him to come back under a
law that makes all Jews citizens of Israel.
   He was born in Jerusalem and his lawyers say he cannot be
deported under Israeli law. Israel says Awad, who spent 15 years in
the United States before returning to Jerusaem in 1985, is an
American whose tourist visa has expired.
   Israel took steps to deport Awad after he urged Palestinians to
use civil disobedience against Israeli occupation, but Israel
claims that is not the reason for the order against him.
   In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian woman, Muneira Safta
Daoud, was charged with causing grevious bodily harm for allegedly
hurling a stone at a Jewish settler who then shot an Israeli girl
in the village of Beita, Israel radio said.
   According to the Israeli media, Miss Daoud stoned Romam Aldubi
after he shot and killed her brother and another Arab.
   Aldubi, a soldier on leave who was guarding a group of Israeli
hikers, fired several bullets after being struck and accidentally
killed the Israeli teen-ager, according to an army report. Tirza
Porat was the first Israeli to die in violence connected with the
5-month-long uprising.
   The government filed charges Monday against two Israeli editors
of a pro-Palestinian newspaper, Derech Hanitzotz. It accused them
of belonging to a terrorist group and having contacts with foreign
agents.
   Roni Ben Efrat and Michal Shwartz could be sentenced to 40 years
in prison each if convicted of association with the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Hussein Shurie, head of a private college in El Bireh, noted
that leaflets put out by leaders of the rebellion urged students to
return to school.
   ``They think it is one of the aims of the `intefadeh' (uprising)
_ to be educated,'' he said.
   The leaflet circulating in the West Bank was the 17th issued by
a group called the Unified National Command.
   ``Our glorious victory by going back to school proves our slogan
that we learn in whatever circumstances,'' it said.
   It called for a one-day general strike Wednesday to mark 40 days
since the assassination of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir, also
known as Abu Jihad, at his home in Tunis, Tunisia. Israeli sources
have said Israeli commandos killed Wazir, but the government has
made no official comment.

<HEAD>TVA Investigates Second Nuclear Shutdown Since Sequoyah's Restart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GEORGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigative team is looking into
what caused Sequoyah Nuclear Plant's balky Unit 2 reactor to shut
down Monday for the second time in 3{ days.
   The reactor automatically shut down at 12:28 a.m. Monday because
of an instrument problem in its reactor coolant system, said Joe
Bynum, the Tennessee Valley Authority's assistant manager of
nuclear power.
   Bynum described the incident at the twin-reactor plant outside
Chattanooga as minor and said it represented no danger to plant
employees or the public.
   The shutdown was the second at Sequoyah since May 13, when Unit
2 became TVA's first reactor to go back on line since the federal
utility shut down its nuclear program in August 1985 because of
safety concerns.
   Unit 2 was approaching 75 percent power at the time of Monday's
shutdown _ about the same level it had reached on May 19 when a
water gauge problem caused the reactor to automatically power down.
   ``It was a relatively minor instrumentation problem that we can
correct,'' said Janice Brady, a plant spokeswoman. ``As we've said
repeatedly, because of the complexity of any nuclear plant, it's
not uncommon for a unit to automatically shut down.''
   The reactor had restarted Saturday after repairs and
adjustments, and plant workers were calibrating a transmitter that
provides readings on reactor water flow when Monday's shutdown
occurred.
   ``The plant's investigative team will be evaluating the cause of
the shutdown,'' Bynum said. ``The transmitters will be recalibrated
and Unit 2 will be returned to safe operation when all activities
are completed.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Expel American Found In Restricted Military Zone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An American free-lance journalist was
arrested and expelled from Nicaragua last week, the U.S. State
Department said Monday. A Nicaraguan official said the man entered
a restricted military zone with fake identification documents.
   The source at Nicaragua's Interior Ministry identified the man
as Gary Moore, 38. He said Moore was working for a conservative
group and was arrested on Wednesday, May 18, at Laguna de Perlas, a
military zone on the Caribbean coast. He was deported to
neighboring Costa Rica either late Friday or Saturday.
   He said Moore ``entered military bases illegally. He also
falsified an accreditation from the presidency's International
Press Center.''
   When in custody, Moore said he worked for the National Forum
Foundation, a conservative group based in Washington, D.C. which
cooperates with the U.S.-supported rebel umbrella group called the
Nicaraguan Resistance, the source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Moore was also found to be carrying a letter of recommendation
from Aristides Sanchez, a leader of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the
source said.
   Moore told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday in San
Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, that he was 38 years old, was from
Tupelo, Miss., and had worked for the Atlanta Constitution and the
Miami Herald.
   The Washington Times said Moore reported in a telephone
interview Sunday that he has contributed to the Wall Street Journal
and ABC News and had credentials from the National Forum Foundation.
   The Times quoted Moore as saying he was not mistreated while
under arrest.
   Moore told the AP said he was working on a documentary on
alleged human rights abuses by the leftist Sandinista government
when arrested.
   ``They confiscated all my material,'' he said, adding that he
was worried the Sandinista authorities would take reprisals against
the people he interviewed.
   Moore said the material consisted of videotapes, notes and
photographs.
   ``They (Sandinista security agents) said they would return it
all in about 15 days,'' he added.
   He confirmed that he was working for the National Forum
Foundation.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Moore was 37 years old and was taken into custody May 17 in
east-central Nicaragua, apparently for visiting a restricted zone
without permission.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
warning to the financial planning industry, said Monday it was
suspending a New Mexico investment adviser for failing to tell
clients she was earning commissions on the securities she
recommended.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Nida Rae Ellis, vice
president of Westmark Financial Services, Albuquerque, N.M., agreed
to accept an SEC censure and a 120-day suspension from working as
an investment adviser or securities broker.
   In what SEC officials said was a ground-breaking case, the
commission found that beginning in June 1986, Ms. Ellis, who was
president of the New Mexico chapter of a national organization of
financial planners, violated federal laws by failing to tell
clients she would receive a commission when they bought into
limited real estate partnerships she was selling.
   She also failed to tell customers they did not have to go
through her to purchase the investment, the SEC said, and some of
the clients were not suited for investments of that level of
sophistication and risk.
   Officials said it was one of the first cases brought against an
investment adviser who is also registered as a securities broker.
   ``It is very important that when investment advisers are wearing
these various hats that they have to bear in mind they have a
fiduciary responsibility to their client,'' said Fred L. Chavez,
SEC assistant regional administrator in Denver.
   Kathryn B. McGrath, director of the SEC division of investment
management, said, ``Consumers seem to approach financial planners
as trusted advisers and financial planners seem to market their
services in that light: `You can come in to us and you don't have
to worry about those brokers or insurance agents who are trying to
sell you something.'
   ``However, many of them, if not most of them, are in fact just
like the broker or the insurance agent that's trying to sell
something,'' she said. ``We're saying they just have to make that
clear to the consumer so they can evaluate the advice with a grain
of salt.
   ``The action we brought hopefully will tell other financial
planners: We're dead serious. These are rules you're subject to and
you have to comply or else,'' she said.
   Ms. Ellis did not immediately return telephone messages left
Monday afternoon at Westmark's office in Albuquerque. A woman
answering the telephone at the office said no officers of the firm
were available to discuss the case.
   Hewitt Covington, counsel for the International Association of
Financial Planning in Atlanta, would not comment on the Westmark
order but said the association investigates complaints against any
of its 24,000 members and would reprimand or expel a member when
justified.
   Covington said many investment advisers work only for fees, much
as a lawyer or accountant, and accept no commissions on securities
they sell, while others are paid both.
   ``Life is full of conflicts of interest and it is not
necessarily nasty to sell something you're recommending, provided
you make the proper disclosure,'' he said.
   Investment advising is a fast-growing field. About 12,000 firms
are registered with the SEC as advisers.

   President Daniel Ortega extended a
cease-fire Monday so peace talks with U.S.-supported rebels can
continue, but disagreement persisted on the site for the next round.
   Ortega insisted that three days of talks scheduled to start
Wednesday be held in Managua but a statement issued in Miami by the
rebels, known as Contras, said the meeting should be in Sapoa, a
southern border post.
   Ortega told reporters his leftist Sandinista government decided
to extend the cease-fire by 30 days. The 60-day truce agreed upon
at the first meeting March 23 in Sapoa would have expired May 30.
   At a second meeting April 28-30, the first held in Managua, the
Sandinistas and Contras tried to negotiate a more permanent truce
in the 6{-year-old war, which Ortega says has killed 26,500 people
and caused $3 billion in damage.
   He said Monday the Sandinistas decided to extend the cease-fire
``in the interest of allowing negotiations to continue on a
definite truce,'' adding: ``We hope the counterrevolutionary
directorate contributes to this effort and acts in accordance with
the Nicaraguan people's wishes for peace.''
   Contra leaders said that, during the last negotiations in
Managua, the Sandinistas denied them free movement and the right to
meet with domestic opposition groups.
   In the statement Monday, the five Nicaraguan Resistance
directors said Sapoa and San Juan del Sur were proposed as meeting
sites by Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the president's brother
and head of the government delegation.
   President Ortega said Monday the Contra delegates would be
allowed to meet in Managua with representatives of the Democratic
Coordinate, the principal opposition group; the opposition
newspaper La Prensa, and Roman Catholic bishops.

<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Danish movie ``Pelle the Conqueror''
won the Golden Palm award Monday night as the best film of the 41st
Cannes Film Festival.
   It was the first time the prize was given to a Danish director.
   French star Gerard Depardieu and Italian director Ettore Scola,
president of the 10-member jury, presented the Golden Palm to
director Bille August, who also wrote the screenplay.
   ``Pelle the Conqueror'' tells of 9-year-old Pelle, who moves to
Denmark from Sweden with his father Lasse at the end of the 19th
century and comes of age in a world of hardship and repression.
They work as cattlemen on a farm and are treated as slaves.
   Through the love of his father and the friendship of a farmhand,
Pelle develops a craving for freedom, rebels against his bosses and
leaves the farm.
   Max von Sydow plays Lasse and 13-year-old Pelle Hvenegaard makes
his debut as the boy.
   The prize for best actor went to Forest Whitaker of the United
States for his role as jazz great Charlie Parker in the movie
``Bird,'' directed by Clint Eastwood.
   Parker, whose bebop saxophone style influenced musicians around
the world, is well-known here even 32 years after his death.
   Whitaker, who also appeared in ``Platoon'' and ``The Color of
Money,'' was joined on stage by Eastwood, his director.
   Three performers shared the best actress award: Barbara Hershey,
an American; Linda Mvusi of South Africa, and 13-year-old Jodhi May
of Britain, who accepted the award for all three.
   They appeared in the British film ``A World Apart,'' which also
won the festival's Special Jury Grand Prize, regarded as a sort of
consolation prize given to the Golden Palm runner-up.
   ``A World Apart'' is based on the true story of Shawn Slovo,
whose parents were anti-apartheid activists. The film looks at
apartheid through the eyes of a sheltered 13-year-old girl (Miss
May) whose father flees and whose mother is imprisoned.
   Director Chris Menges accepted the award for his first film.

<HEAD>Lords Kill Attempt to Alter Thatcher Tax Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Lords gave Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher an important victory Monday, killing an attempt by rebels
in her Conservative Party to amend tax legislation.
   The unelected upper chamber of Parliament voted 317-183 against
an amendment that would have mandated a closer link to a person's
ability to pay. It was the largest turnout in the Lords since 1971.
   Although the Lords and House of Commons still may consider other
amendments, the government's victory ensures passage of the major
principles of the tax legislation, which was nearly defeated by a
Commons revolt in April.
   Lord Chelwood, leader of the rebellion in the Lords, said during
debate on his amendment that the Thatcher government proposals
``are a lot less fair'' than the current system.
   ``They have very little support,'' said Chelwood, a former
Conservative member of the Commons. ``They are extremely unpopular
in the country.''
   He condemned suggestions by some peers that the chamber had no
right to challenge legislation passed by the Commons. The Lords
does not have the power to interfere with taxation, but some lords
said it was not clear whether the poll tax was an issue of taxation
or local authority.
   ``We are a revising chamber, seeking to exercise restraint on
the otherwise unfettered power of the Commons,'' Chelwood said.
``If we cannot `tamper' with legislation, we really have nothing to
do.''
   Under the so-called poll tax, which critics say is unfair to the
poor, property taxes are levied on each adult rather than on houses
or apartments. Although the poor will get rebates, they must pay a
tax of at least 5 percent.
   The legislation, a clause in the bill on local government
finances, is central to Mrs. Thatcher's legislative program for
curbing expenditures by local councils, most of which are
controlled by the opposition Labor Party.
   In the Lords on Monday, many peers echoed government assertions
that people would be less likely to elect free-spending councils if
they felt the pinch of the local tax bill.
   A rebel amendment was defeated 320-295 a month ago in the
Commons, where the Conservatives have a majority of 101.

   The Senate on Monday easily rejected three new
Republican challenges to the medium-range missile treaty and Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole said ``it would be an embarrassment'' to
President Reagan if the pact isn't ratified before Reagan goes to
Moscow next weekend.
   The Kansas Republican told his colleagues, ``the ball is in our
court, the Republicans' court'' as the Democratic-controlled
chamber began a second week of work on the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty.
   Later, Secretary of State George Shultz met with Republican
senators and urged approval of the pact before the summit.
   ``Here is a treaty that has been examined in more detail than
any arms control treaty in history, by far,'' Shultz said after the
Capitol Hill session. ``There is a time to inquire and there is
also a time to vote. ... It would be a good thing to have it.''
   The first decision came when the Senate voted 81-13 to kill an
amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. It would have prevented the
treaty from taking effect until Reagan reassures Congress about the
accuracy of the number of triple-warhead Soviet SS-20 missiles
which will be destroyed.
   Later, the chamber killed, on a 68-26 vote, an amendment by Sen.
Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., that would have required a change in the
treaty's text to eliminate what he said was a loophole that would
have permitted construction of some Soviet missiles.
   Then, the Senate rejected, 81-5, an amendment by Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., that would have delayed the INF pact until the
two nations agreed on a more far-reaching pact providing 50 percent
cuts in each side's large arsenals of long-range atomic weapons.
   Humphrey said, ``We ought to wait until we see the whole
picture'' before approving any pact, but critics termed it a
``killer amendment'' designed to derail the treaty.
   Before the votes, Dole told his colleagues again the Senate
should approve the pact before Reagan meets Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in Moscow from May 29 to June 2.
   Helms and other conservatives have blocked action by the full
Senate, delaying the ratification that even critics say is assured.
Ratification requires a two-thirds majority voting in favor.
   ``I'm still convinced it would be an embarrassment to the
president of the United States to sit down with Mr. Gorbachev later
this week without the Senate have taken action to consent to
ratification of the treaty,'' Dole said.
   However, he added, ``We have some serious issues that, in some
cases, may take several hours or days.''
   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, requires
destruction within three years of all atomic missiles with ranges
between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. For the Soviets, that includes
400 deployed SS-20s and another 250 stockpiled SS-20s.
   The United States has accepted the Soviet statement of 650
SS-20s, even though Defense Intelligence Agency analysts say the
Soviets may be hiding more than 250 of the weapons.
   ``We were snookered,'' Helms said. ``The estimates are that the
Soviets have 300 to 600 more than the 650 thy admit to having.''
   ``This is a gut issue,'' Helms said. ``It could mean the
difference between survival and destruction for Europe, or a good
part of it.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., noted that Reagan administration
officials have rejected Helms' claim, although Lugar conceded it is
difficult to prove that no SS-20s are hidden.
   ``It is akin to proving the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist,''
Lugar said.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said that even if SS-20s are
hidden, they could not be deployed without violating the treaty and
their ``viability would degrade quickly'' without testing.
   Helms' amendment ``is not needed, it is unnecessary and it would
hamper our efforts to get the INF treaty in place,'' Cranston said.
   Wallop's proposal affected a part of the treaty which, he said,
was written in such a way as to permit production of Soviet SS-25
missiles that would be interchangeable with stages in the SS-20.
The SS-25 is not banned.
   ``This amendment just is to make certain that we do what we set
out to do,'' Wallop said, explaining that he wanted to make sure
that no SS-25s were produced that would be interchangeable with the
SS-20.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, agreed with Wallop that the treaty's language
``is awkwardly written.''
   But Pell said the amendment wasn't needed because if the Soviets
produce SS-25 stages which are interchangeable with the SS-20, they
would be in violation of the pact.
   Among the issues remaining to be settled is an amendment, backed
by the Democratic majority, which would require Senate approval
before any future administration could change how the United States
interprets the INF pact.
   That amendment is the result of a fight between Reagan and
Democrats over the U.S. interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile pact.
   Reagan asserts that his administration unilaterally can change
how the treaty is interpreted, a view disputed by congressional
Democrats. The amendment banning any INF reinterpretation was added
by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee over the opposition of
Republicans.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Monday the
treaty ``should be nailed in. It shouldn't be subject to
reinterpretation.''
   He said, ``I'm certainly not interested in any erosion of the
Senate's constitutional role in treaty making. ... I don't propose
to give the store away.''

   A man who says he was raised to be a racist
pleaded innocent Monday to a federal charge of threatening to kill
black Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson.
   Londell Williams, 30, was accused in an indictment last week of
threatening Jackson's life. The indictment also accused him and his
wife, Tammy, 27, of possessing an unregistered automatic rifle and
threatening and intimidating a government informant.
   At their arraignment before U.S. District Judge Edward L.
Filippine, the Williamses pleaded innocent to the charges, but said
nothing in their own behalf.
   In response to questions to determine their competency, both
told the judge they do not have mental problems and do not abuse
alcohol or drugs.
   They and their lawyers declined comment following the court
appearance.
   Filippine gave lawyers on both sides 11 days to file
post-arraignment motions. The judge set a trial date of July 18.
   The Williamses were arrested May 13 at their apartment in
Washington, Mo., about 50 miles west of St. Louis. They had lived
there about a year since moving from a farm in the Ozark hills of
southwest Missouri.
   The U.S. attorney said initially that evidence _ including a
secretly recorded conversation between Londell Williams and the
informant _ indicated that a white supremacist organization called
the Covenant, Sword and the Arm of the Lord was conspiring to kill
Jackson June 21 or July 4. Williams said Jackson was targeted
because he was ``getting too close to being president of the United
States.''
   The government's complaint, which preceded Thursday's
indictment, cited a loaded AR-15 rifle that, with help from an
informant, was found by sheriff's deputies in a wooded area of
Franklin County.
   Near the rifle was a bag containing a post card addressed to
Londell Williams and maps, one of which bore his fingerprints, the
complaint said.
   Authorities charged the Williamses with threatening the
informant during a meeting on May 11.
   The indictment made no mention of white supremacists or a
conspiracy. The FBI has said that it has been unable to find any
evidence that the Williamses belonged to CSA or any other white
supremacist organization.
   Since their arrests, the Williamses have denied that they are
members of such groups. Londell Williams also has denied, in media
interviews, having planned to kill Jackson.
   Williams has said, however, that he has ``prejudices ... against
anything that isn't white.''
   ``That's how I've been raised,'' he said.

   In the era of ``glasnost,'' a sentence to years of
hard labor in a Soviet prison camp is not the automatic response to
dissent. Greater debate on some topics is allowed. But there are
still limits.
   For all the talk about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy
of openness and tolerance, political prisoners remain in jails. And
longtime refuseniks, repeatedly denied permission to leave, say
they are worn out.
   ``As long as people are sitting in prison camps and people
aren't allowed to emigrate, fear won't be cleansed from the soul,''
said Lev Timofeyev, a journalist and economist.

   Morale is low in many Red Army units in
Afghanistan as at least 100 Soviet soldiers are known to have
deserted, according to a study released Monday citing widespread
instances of ethnic friction, drug use, suicide and ``fragging,''
the murder of officers by their troops.
   The study, conducted for the Army by the RAND Corp. before the
start of the Soviet withdrawal, found that ``the war in Afghanistan
has shown that ethnic cleavages in the Soviet armed forces continue
to be deep,'' particularly between Moslems and Russians and other
Slavs.
   But the author, Alex Alexiev, cautioned that many of the
problems encountered by the Red Army in Afghanistan stemmed
specifically from that conflict and ``would not be likely to play
much of a role in other war scenarios,'' such as a conflict between
the Warsaw Pact and NATO.

   Against a backdrop of nearly 200 police
officers, Gov. William Donald Schaefer signed a law Monday making
Maryland the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as
Saturday Night Specials.
   ``This is the first time a legislature has stood up and said,
`These guns are wrong,''' the governor said. He said the measure is
a step toward stopping ``the senseless killing on our streets.''
   Looking on was White House press secretary James Brady, who was
wounded by a Saturday Night Special in the 1981 assassination
attempt on President Reagan by John W. Hinckley Jr. Brady's wife,
Sarah, had lobbied for the bill.

   The National Cancer Institute said Monday it
will try to double over the next four years the number of patients
who receive experimental treatments in an effort to speed up the
search for ways to stop the biggest cancer killers.
   Largely because of physicians' reluctance to enroll their
patients in cancer experiments, officials said, it may take 10
years or longer to assess the value of promising new therapies.
   ``We are not getting enrolled anywhere near the number of
patients we need to get answers within a reasonable period of
time,'' Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., director of the cancer
institute, said at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology.

   America is sliding backward in efforts to
achieve equality for minorities and must embark on a 20-year drive
to close the gap between the races on income, education and other
measures of status, a group of civic, academic and political
leaders said Monday.
   The Commission on Minority Participation in Education and
American Life, whose members include former Presidents Ford and
Carter, said: ``In the last 10 years, not only have we lost the
momentum of earlier minority progress, we have suffered actual
reversals in the drive to achieve full equality for minority
citizens.''
   ``America is moving backward _ not forward _ in its efforts to
achieve the full participation of minority citizens in the life and
prosperity of the nation,'' the commission declared in its
10,000-word report, ``One-Third of A Nation.''

determined campaign to force Congress to vote on his plan to expand
Medicare _ and Medicare taxes _ to cover the expenses of home

   Next month's Communist Party conference is shaping
up to be a face-off between supporters of radical change and
advocates of just ``a little polishing up'' of the old Soviet
system, party activists reported Monday.
   Despite efforts by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to draw only backers of
his policy of ``perestroika,'' or wholesale rebuilding of Soviet
society, some who fear reform is being introduced too quickly may
be selected as delegates to the June 28 conference.
   A closed-door meeting of the party Central Committee devoted to
preparations for next month's conference selected Gorbachev to
deliver the key address to the gathering, which will pass judgment
on his reform program, the Tass news agency reported.

   The reformers who now control the
Communist Party embarked Monday on a program of sweeping changes
they hope will rescue the faltering economy.
   Hungary's turn from old leadership to a new generation of highly
trained managers, intellectuals and economic theorists may be the
most dramatic change of course in Eastern Europe since Alexander
Dubcek's liberal ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
   The most important difference is that Moscow now supports
reform, under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``perestroika'' plan, and the
Warsaw Pact invasion that drove Dubcek out is not likely to be
repeated.

   Dozens of small and moderate earthquakes
that began over the weekend forced schools, government offices and
many businesses to close Monday in this capital city of 2 million
people.
   The government ordered the one-day shutdown for Guatemala City
and the surrounding area, except for hospitals and other essential
services, the Defense Ministry and the National Emergency
Commission.
   Some stores opened, along with banks and La Aurora Airport
operated normally. It is near a geological fault on the south side
of the city, the epicenter of the quakes.
   The National Seismological Institute said at least 50 tremors
measuring from 2.1 to 4.0 on the open-ended Richter scale had
shaken the capital since midnight Friday.
   Many people living near the fault zone have been sleeping
outside their homes. A few old walls cracked but no major damage
was reported, according to news reports.
   On Feb. 4, 1976, an earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter scale
devastated Guatemala City and killed more than 22,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
A quake registering 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. One
of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage.
   Communications Minister Mario Lopez described the forced
shutdown Monday as a precaution ``because of the situation caused
by the constant and continuous earthquakes.''
   He said the decision was made ``to avoid any (traffic)
congestion and so that families can be together in their homes.''

   The first non-experimental aircraft that
flies both like a helicopter and an airplane rolled into the
spotlight Monday, hailed as an aviation milestone by legislators
and top military brass.
   The V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and hovers
like a helicopter and flies like an airplane, received a standing
ovation from a crowd of 1,600. The crowd watched as the camouflaged
craft was towed onto the tarmac at Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.'s
Flight Research Center.
   The first flight of the V-22, which has been in development for
30 years, is scheduled for Aug. 15. An advanced experimental model,
the XV-15, has been flying since 1977.
   Fort Worth-based Bell and Boeing Helicopter Co. of Philadelphia
are jointly developing the V-22 for the Navy, Marines and Air
Force. The three services plan to buy 682 of the twin-engine
aircraft at an estimated cost of $16.6 million each.
   ``It's kind of awesome,'' Marine Corps Commandant Alfred M. Gray
Jr. told the crowd.
   ``It works, it's ahead of schedule and will be a sound
investment for taxpayers' money,'' said Navy Secretary William L.
Ball III, comparing the tilt-rotor's production to the jet engine's
development as aviation milestones.
   ``You are proving every day that a great country can still
outthink, out-design and out-produce all comers,'' Ball said.
   The three military services plan to use the V-22 for combat
assault, search and rescue, medical evacuation and special-forces
missions. Other uses, including anti-submarine warfare, also are
being studied. The cabin can carry 24 combat-equipped troops in
addition to a crew of three.
   ``On our abortive rescue attempt made in Iran a few years ago,
think what could have happened if they'd had an Osprey,'' said
House Speaker Jim Wright, referring to the failed 1980 rescue of 44
American hostages from Tehran.
   The Osprey, about the size of a medium transport aircraft, has a
stocky 57.3-foot-long fuselage and twin engines mounted on thick,
stubby wings. Its engines point upward during takeoff and landing,
with 38-foot diameter rotor blades that parallel the ground.
   The engines rotate, or ``tilt,'' forward once the V-22 is
airborne. Rotors lock into place and act like oversized propellers,
pulling the Osprey through the air like a conventional aircraft.
   The tilt-rotor can fly with the speed and range of a turboprop
plane _ more than 360 mph _ but doesn't require an airport or
runway. It also can hover like a helicopter.
   ``I'm convinced that in the next 20 years there will be
thousands of these in use,'' said Bell President L.M. ``Jack''
Horner.
   Bell has talked with American Airlines and several commuter
companies about civilian uses for the craft, a spokesman said.
   ``The New York (and New Jersey) Port Authority is a strong
supporter of this concept,'' said Horner. ``We could build a lot of
V-22s for the cost of one airport.
   The British-designed Harrier jump-jet also takes off and lands
vertically, but using jet-propulsion rather than a rotor system.

   Syria called it ``out of the question''
for Iran to join any military force sent into the south Beirut
slums to end 18 days of fighting between Shiite Moslem factions,
Lebanese officials reported Monday.
   They said Syria's rejection of an Iranian proposal to join such
a force was conveyed by Syria's military intelligence chief in
Beirut, Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, at a six-hour meeting with Iran's
deputy foreign minister, Hossein Sheikholeslam, that ended at dawn
Monday.
   Mortar and howitzer fire pounded the 16 square miles of
tin-roofed shanties and narrow alleyways Monday, killing 13 people
and wounding 78, police said.
   In east Beirut, President Amin Gemayel's Phalange fighters and
men of the main Christian militia Lebanese Forces fought with
machine guns and hand grenades Monday night for control of the
capital's Christian sector.
   Police said five combatants were wounded in the Sin el-Fil
district, including at least one Phalangist and two from the
Lebanese Forces. They said fighting began after Lebanese Forces
gunmen wounded Nabil Kahhaleh, Phalangist commander in the
district, and that it abated at about 11 p.m.
   Representatives of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, and the pro-Syrian Amal militia also attended the overnight
meeting between Syria and Iran.
   Monday's casualties raised the toll to 279 killed and 951
wounded since battles for control of the slums broke out May 6
between Hezbollah and Amal.
   The Lebanese officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the dispute over who would serve in a military force in the
slums again delayed Syria's plans to try to end the fighting.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine
Americans, are believed held by Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers in
the embattled enclave.
   Two Beirut dailies, the independent An-Nahar and leftist
As-Safir, reported that Hammoud and Amal representatives insisted
that the Syrian army take charge of security in south Beirut.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, endorsed the
demand.
   ``There is no other alternative. The Syrian army has to go in to
stop the bloodletting and end the plight of the population,'' Hoss
said in a statement.
   An-Nahar quoted the Iranian deputy foreign minister as saying
Iran would approve a Syrian military intervention in the slums only
if the hostage situation was resolved ``in a way that serves the
objective for which they were kidnapped.''
   Sheikholeslam did not elaborate, but An-Nahar quoted him as
saying the hostages were a ``vital issue for Iran.''
   Iran also demanded guarantees that Hezbollah will be free to
continue political activity in the slums after the Syrian
deployment.
   Syria has kept massed around the slums about 7,500 troops, 100
tanks and 400 armored vehicles since Hezbollah overran Amal
strongholds to seize control of 90 percent of the urban
battleground.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf
war against Iraq, long a rival of Syria in Arab politics.
   But Hezbollah's move to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites
has strained that alliance.
   The Syrians consider neighboring Lebanon to be vital to their
security.
   Amal spokesmen have complained that delaying Syrian deployment
will only prolong suffering of thousands of civilians trapped in
the slums.
   Police have said about 70 percent of the slums' estimated
250,000 residents have fled to safer areas.

   Corporate leaders and three of the nation's
most popular musical groups on Monday announced a drive to
encourage American youth to prepare themselves for a future in the
workforce.
   ``This is a long-term commitment,'' William H. Kolberg,
president of the National Alliance of Business, told a new
conference. ``This is a very competitive world. We need every
single young person to be educated, to be available, to want to
work and to be productive.''
   Noting that youth unemployment was triple adult unemployment,
Kolberg said there were thousands of young people who could benefit
from job training but were not getting the proper information.
   Each year's school dropouts cost the nation $240 billion in lost
income and productivity over their lifetimes, he said, adding that
the figure ``doesn't even begin to take in the costs due to drugs
and alcohol abuse, to crime, to simple human misery and despair.''
   The program, involving Kolberg's group, the National Association
of Broadcasters and the nation's job training system, will use the
popularity of musical groups Aerosmith, Los Lobos and Run-DMC to
promote the message of ``Work Works.''
   ``When these kids won't listen to us, they will listen to them.
We are determined to make a dent in this problem,'' Kolberg said.
   He said that Run-DMC alone ``will play to more than one million
people at their concerts this summer _ and if we can reach a
fraction of them with the message that work works and that jobs and
skills training is available, then we can make a difference.''
   Each of the rock groups will record public service
announcements, appear in press conferences with officials in cities
on their tour and donate job information booths at each of their
concert sites, where members of the audience can apply for jobs and
training, Kolberg said.
   Also at the news conference were the three members of Run-DMC _
Joseph Simmons (Run), Darryl McDaniels (DMC) and Jason Mizell (Jam
Master Jay).
   The group also has been active in the Drug Enforcement
Administration's anti-drug promotion, raising money for famine
relief in Africa and the Special Olympics and talking to teens
about gangs and the need for education.
   ``We don't want to preach. We can only set an example by being
involved with a program like this,'' said McDaniels. ``We've been
telling them to `Say no to drugs' and other things. We want them to
say `yes' to staying in school and being a success at anything they
want to do.''

   A man ``who made greed his god'' was
convicted Monday of kidnapping and murdering a prominent
businessman who was buried alive and suffocated in a botched $1
million ransom scheme.
   Jurors deliberated only about an hour following a week-long
trial before finding Daniel Edwards, 31, of Bourbonnais guilty of
murdering Kankakee businessman Stephen Small.
   Edwards stood quietly and showed no emotion as the verdict was
read in the courtroom of Kankakee County Circuit Judge John Michela.
   A second phase of the trial will determine whether Edwards is
sentenced to death.
   Small, 40, was the great-grandson of former Illinois Gov. Len
Small and was a member of a family with major media holdings. He
was the former vice president of Mid America Media, a group that
owned radio and cable television stations, before the company was
was sold in 1986.
   Edwards' live-in girlfriend, Nancy D. Rish, 26, also was charged
in the scheme and is awaiting trial.
   Earlier Monday, prosecutors said Edwards planned Small's
kidnapping because he craved money.
   Edwards was ``a man who made greed his god,'' said Frank
Nowicki, an assistant Illinois attorney general.
   ``All Danny boy had to do to cash in on that jackpot was put
Stephen Small ... in a box,'' said Michael Ficaro, another
assistant Illinois attorney general, slamming his hand on the top
of the coffin-sized crate in which Small died.
   ``I never saw anybody come out of a grave. You bury people who
are dead in a grave,'' Ficaro said.
   But Edwards' attorney, Sheldon Reagan, argued that Small was
buried with candy bars, lights, and water and hadn't been harmed
before being put in the box. He said a faulty air supply system
caused Small's death.
   ``It's an accident but it's not an intentional murder,'' said
Reagan, who suggested someone else abducted Small. ``I know you
want to convict somebody, but certainly not for murder.''
   Small was lured from his restored Victorian home with a
telephone call after midnight Sept. 2, 1987. His family received
clear instructions for delivering the ransom.
   Two days later, police found Small's body in the box, buried
under 3 feet of sand 13 miles southeast of Kankakee.
   The jury, picked in northern Illinois' Winnebago County because
of publicity the case received locally, heard a tape of Small's
voice relaying the ransom demand to his family, and heard witnesses
who saw Edwards building the box.
   Perhaps the most chilling evidence was the tape-recorded voice
of Small on the telephone, telling his wife, Nancy: ``It's no joke.
I'm inside ... a box. Grave.''
   ``It's under a couple of feet of sand or something, like
underground,'' Small told his wife. ``I want you to get $1 million.
God only knows how you're going to do that. He says there's 48
hours of air for me.''
   Prosecutors called the tapes the voice from the grave.
   Reagan, however, told jurors that no one had identified the
voice on the ransom tapes as Edwards' voice, and said ``the facts
don't tell you'' that Edwards was the kidnapper.
   Throughout the trial, the box was on display in the courtroom.
   ``Take a good long look,'' said Ficaro. ``Danny Edwards' greed
for the big score drove those nails, dug that grave and buried
Stephen Small alive.''

<HEAD>^Wanted French Criminal Succo Dies in Italian Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICENZA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian-born Roberto Succo, one of
France's most wanted criminals as a multiple killer and a robber,
was found dead in his prison cell Monday in an apparent suicide.
   Succo, 26, who was accused in a string of murders and robberies
in France, Switzerland and Italy, was discovered with his head in a
plastic bag, said Vicenza Police Chief Piernicola Silvis.
   A magistrate was investigating the death, Silvis said.
   Last week, an Italian judge declared Succo mentally incapable of
understanding or taking part in his defense. The judge referred to
psychologists who found Succo schizophrenic and a danger to society.
   Succo was arrested Feb. 28 near Treviso, his native town in
northern Italy, on charges of illegal possession of a gun and using
false documents.
   Two days later, he bolted from his guards in the courtyard of
the Treviso jail and climbed on the roof. He stripped to his
underwear and hurled bricks at cars before he fell after dangling
from a roof cable. Succo, slightly injured, was transferred to the
more secure jail in Vicenza.
   Succo escaped in May 1986 while on furlough from a psychiatric
prison in Reggio Emilia, where he was held after killing his mother
and father in 1981.
   He fled to France, where he was accused of killing two
policemen, a doctor and two women.
   Succo was charged in the January 1988 slaying of police
inspector Michel Morandin in Toulon, where he had lived for a year
among prostitutes and sailors and was known as ``Andre.''
   He was also charged with killing a police official, Michel
Castillo, in Chambery in April 1987. Other victims included a
doctor in Aix les Bains and two women near d'Annecy, all killed in
1987.
   After Morandin's slaying, Succo escaped to Switzerland, where he
was accused of armed robbery and hostage-taking.
   Police said that when he was arrested after coming to Italy from
Switzerland, he Treviso. At the time of his arrest, Succo was
traveling in a stolen car. In the car, police found a handgun
allegedly used in the slaying of one of the French policemen.
   Both France and Switzerland approached Italy about possible
extradition, but no decision had been announced.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Defense Wants Justice To OK Prosecution by Independent
Counsel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense in the Iran-Contra case sought a
court order Monday to ensure that the Justice Department has the
final say over whether to proceed with the prosecution of the case.
   Lawyers for fired National Security Council aide Oliver L. North
and three co-defendants sought a ruling that the attorney general
has the sole authority to determine whether use of sensitive
documents to prosecute the case would jeopardize national security.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), the
government can decide that disclosure of secrets in a criminal
trial would so jeopardize national security that the case should be
dropped.
   The defense sought to disqualify independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh from making that determinion under CIPA, which was invoked
because the Iran-Contra conspiracy case involves an unprecedented
volume of highly secret government documents.
   Any determination to proceed with prosecuting the case ``will
profoundly affect this country's national defense and its foreign
relations,'' the defense said in a joint filing with U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   ``A blunder by the IC (independent counsel) may well result in
serious ruptures with our closest allies; in the loss of vital
secrets to our enemies; and in the deaths of innocent persons of
whom the IC does not even have knowledge,'' the defense said.
   ``Congress has entrusted the delicate balancing that CIPA
requires to the attorney general, and did so with utmost clarity,
precisely to avoid such disasters,'' lawyers for North, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord said in the brief.
   The four are accused of conspiring to defraud the government by
diverting profits from the U.S. sale of arms to Iran to the
Nicaraguan rebels when direct American military aid to the Contras
was banned by Congress.
   In a May 13 filing, Walsh said he had authority to decide decide
whether to seek declassification of the large volume of secret
documents that would be needed to try the case.
   Such authority was derived from the independent counsel statute
and the parallel appointment he received from the attorney general
to prosecute the case, Walsh said.
   But the independent counsel conceded that he ``must be
deferential to the executive's determination as to whether national
security concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classified
information.''
   In the final analysis, Walsh reluctantly conceded that the
Justice Department would have the final say. ``It is the inherent
function of the executive branch to maintain the confidentiality of
sensitive national security information to the extent necessary to
permit the government to conduct the foreign affairs and national
defense activities effectively,'' Walsh had said.
   The defense said it wanted the order to disqualify the
independent counsel's office becuse its ``vague promise to pay
`deference' to the executive branch in exercising the attorney
general's responsibilities under CIPA cannot mask its attempt to
seize power over national security in single-minded pursuit of its
own interests.''
   More than 200,000 pages of classified government documents were
collected by Walsh during his investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair. Walsh said some 50,000 are relevant to the case and 5
percent to 10 percent of the total contain highly sensitive
information that could jeopardize U.S. intelligence operations.
   Only the government agencies that classified the documents in
the first place have the power to declassify the material so it can
be used in court as evidence.
   The judge can delete classified text from a document or
substitute a statement of facts to show what the document would
prove if it were introduced as evidence. But Gesell has indicated
an unwillingness to spend much time poring over secret material to
prepare sanitized versions for a jury.
   No date for the trial has been set.

   The opposition National Action Party
began protest actions Monday after complaining that preliminary
results were rigged in a special mayoral election in the northern
steel-producing city of Monclova.
   The party _ known as the PAN _ planned protest meetings this
week in Monclova and other cities throughout the northern border
state of Coahuila state to pressure the state legislature to reject
the figures, said Juan Antonio Garcia Villa, the PAN president in
Monclova.
   A special election commission said over the weekend that Benigno
Franco Colorado, candidate of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won the May 8 election by 294 votes.
More than 23,000 ballots were cast.
   The state legislature has not certified the results.
   The PAN says its candidate, Carlos Paez Falcon, won by 448 votes.
   It says it has copies of all the voting results and can prove
that the figures from seven precincts were altered.
   ``Because of this intent of fraud, the PAN is calling on its
supporters to carry out legitimate protests,'' Garcia said by
telephone Monday.
   Manuel Clouthier, PAN's presidential candidate in July 6 general
elections, broke off campaigning in northern Tamaulipas state to
head Monday for Monclova. Garcia said Clouthier will announce
``civil disobedience tactics'' at a rally there.
   Garcia said PAN supporters already were marching in protest near
the international bridges at Ciudad Acuna and Piedras Negras, just
south of the Texas border.
   The PRI won the Coahuila gubernatorial race and 37 of the 38
mayoralties at stake in regular elections on Oct. 25, 1987.
   But the state legislature, citing voting irregularities and
violence, annulled the Monclova elections and set special elections
for May 8.
   The PRI and the PAN have fought for nine years for control of
Monclova, a city of 300,000 people about 200 miles south of the
Texas border at Eagle Pass.
   Its most recent administration was controlled by a bilateral
commission, appointed after neither party could prove it won the
1984 mayoral race.

   A man who initially fled a hit-and-run
accident but then pulled over to resolve the problem was struck and
killed by another hit-and-run driver, police said.
   The dead man, was identified as Duilio Vignolo, 23, of Sunrise.
   He had been driving along Interstate 95 on Sunday when he
sideswiped a vehicle owned by Duffy Shuler, 23, of Plantation.
Vignolo fled the accident, according to a Florida Highway Patrol
report.
   Later, however, he pulled over by the side of the highway.
Shuler spotted him and pulled alongside.
   Vignolo emerged first from his car and began to walk toward
Shuler. As Shuler opened his car door, a third car slammed into the
door, then plowed into Vignolo, dragging him more than 100 feet.
   The car sped away and troopers have made no arrests in the case.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson unveiled a five-year
budget plan that would raise taxes on the rich, freeze defense
spending and increase support for social programs on Monday. He
dismissed Democratic rival Michael Dukakis' earlier proposals as
``radically conservative.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential front-runner, defended his
spending priorities, saying they do ``represent a fundamental
change.''
   And he indirectly criticized Jackson for trying to map out
specific expenses so far in advance. ``There's no way you can
prepare a budget today for 1989,'' Dukakis said after an appearance
at a child care center in Cranford, N.J.
   The Massachusetts governor spent most of Monday in Boston, while
George Bush was in Washington, leaving the campaign trail to
Jackson.
   Jackson made sure they weren't forgotten, attacking the budget
policies of the Reagan administration and complaining that Dukakis'
proposed changes were too timid.
   ``We cannot be fooled into thinking the Reagan-Bush deficits
make social justice impossible,'' Jackson said at a news
conference. ``The Jackson budget reduces the deficit and funds
needed investments. This is a budget for a strong and secure
America.''
   Jackson also made an appearance at a day care center and the
Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, the object of a Sacramento area
voters' referendum seeking to shut it down permanently, as he
campaigned for his share of the 314 Democratic National Convention
delegates up for grabs in California's June 7 presidential primary.
   Jackson drew some boos from the Rancho Seco plant workers when
he told them the nuclear power industry is ``a dangerous job
option.''
   His five-year federal budget plan would increase taxes on the
wealthy by $244 billion and on corporations by $104 billion, cut
defense spending by $164 billion by imposing a five-year freeze on
projected spending hikes and increase spending on social programs
by $344 billion.
   He said it would also cut the nation's deficit from a projected
$134 billion in 1993 to $49 billion.
   Jackson repeatedly contrasted his budget proposals with those of
Dukakis, which he characterized as inadequate to reverse the
Republican priorities set over the past eight years by President
Reagan.
   ``Reagan has cut investment in health care, housing, legal
services, day care, scholarships by more than $100 billion. Mr.
Dukakis rails against that as being wrong, but offers to offset it
by only $775 million,'' Jackson said.
   ``That is radically conservative, away from the dreams and
aspirations of most Democrats. Unless there is a commitment to
economic justice and change, he will find himself taken adrift to
sea by the Democratic constituents. Instead of leading them, he
will be on a raft without a rudder,'' Jackson said of Dukakis.
   ``Our commitment is not to make bland beautiful. It's new
directions,'' Jackson continued.
   Christopher Edley, Dukakis' issues director, said Jackson was
unfairly criticizing Dukakis' plans for spending $775 million _
$500 million on the Fund to Rebuild America, $250 million on a
teacher excellence program and $25 million on a literacy Corps.
   ``The way to make critical new investments in a time of
triple-digit deficits is not to make unrealistic promises about
massive new spending,'' Edley said in a telephone interview from
Boston. ``We have to think of creative ways to use modest federal
resources to pull in private and state and local funds.''
   Jackson, repeating a campaign theme, said he would raise up to
$58 billion a year for social programs such as housing, education
and health care by freezing the military budget at its current $300
billion level for the next five years.
   ``My plan allows for a significant new social investment,
including doubling of the education budget by 1993, a new national
housing initiative, and an additional $3 billion per year for the
war on drugs. These investments and deficit reduction are made
possible by a combination of fair taxes on the wealthy and
corporations and a freeze on Pentagon spending for five years,''
Jackson said.
   ``I am for a strong defense. I also support a sound approach to
the military budget. Our plan would freeze military spending,''
Jackson said.
   ``Cost overruns ... two additional aircraft carrier task forces,
Star Wars and the Midgetman do not make us stronger. They undermine
our economy and make us weaker. Even after the Jackson cuts, real
military spending will be 25 percent higher in 1993 than in 1980,''
he said.
   Dukakis also opposes the two additional aircraft carrier task
forces and the Midgetman missile system, and would cut back the
Star Wars nuclear defense program to 1983 levels. Dukakis has
called for a ``stable'' overall defense budget, with increases in
conventional forces coming from cuts in strategic systems.
   The biggest tax increase in Jackson's budget plan would restore
the top 38.5 percent income tax rate. ``It's just the top 600,000
taxpayers who earn $200,000 and above, who will return from 28
percent to 38.5 percent. They can afford it,'' Jackson said.
   Other revenue measures would increase the minimum tax rate on
corporations, impose a 0.5 percent securities transfer excise tax
to raise $10 billion annual revenue and discourage major corporate
mergers and takeovers, limit deductions for business meals to 50
percent, and impose a $7-billion-a-year ``polluters tax'' on
corporations.
   Among his proposed ``new investments'' are programs which by
1993 would spend an extra $20 billion annually on education and job
training, $17 billion on housing programs, $12 billion on health
and nutrition programs and $3 billion more annually on AIDS
programs.
   Jackson's budget proposals also include $5 billion more in
transportation funding, $4.5 billion for scientific research in
non-military fields, $1.7 billion annually on environmental
programs, and $1 billion more annually for international economic
assistance.

   Slain U.S. District Judge Richard
Daronco earlier in his career issued a landmark divorce ruling and
presided over two highly publicized murder trials.
   As a state Supreme Court justice in 1982, Daronco ruled that a
woman who worked to pay her husband's way through medical school
should be awarded a financial share of her husband's medical
practice in the couple's divorce.
   In 1978, as a Westchester County Court judge, Daronco presided
over the trial of Richard Herrin, a Yale University student who was
convicted of manslaughter in the hammer slaying of ex-girlfriend
and fellow Yale student Bonnie Garland as she slept in her
Scarsdale home.
   Calling Herrin's act ``needless, heartless, cruel and brutal,''
Daronco sentenced Herrin to up to 25 years in prison.
   Earlier that year, Daronco presided over the trial of two
Connecticut men charged with the brutal killing of two Lewisboro
housewives and sentenced both men to 25-years-to-life prison terms.
   Daronco, 56, was gunned down at his home in suburban Pelham
Saturday by a former New York City policeman after ruling against
the killer's daughter in a sexual harassment and job discrimination
lawsuit, authorities said. The killer, Charles L. Koster, 67, of
Bath, Pa., committed suicide, police said.

   Fire broke out Monday night on a Sealink freight
ferry with 75 people aboard in the English Channel, and one person
was reported missing and another injured, said the coast guard in
Dover.
   The ferry, the 5,088-ton Seafreight Freeway, told the French
coast guard at Cap Gris Nez that the blaze was under control, the
British domestic news agency Press Association said. However, there
was concern among nearby rescue craft since the ferry was
reportedly carrying dangerous cargo, it said.
   No further information was available on the dangerous cargo
report.
   A Dover coast guard spokeswoman said the ferry, sailing from
Dover, southeast England, to Zeebrugge, Belgium, carried 43
passengers and 32 crew.
   It was about 28 miles off Ramsgate on the southeast tip of
England, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.
   Sealink recently restored channel service after a walkout by
seamen supporting the continuing strike against P and O European
Ferries Ltd.
   Staff at hospitals in Canterbury and Margate went on alert.
Police said all power on the ship had been lost and the rescue was
taking place in darkness.
   The blaze was believed to have broken out in the engine room of
the ferry about two hours after it sailed out of Dover at 7:30 p.m.
(2:30 p.m. EDT) bound for Zeebrugge, Press Association said.
   A truck driver and a crew member were originally reported
missing but the driver was later accounted for, it added.
   Helicopter pilot Jonathon Noble said a Wessex helicopter from
Manston was the first on the scene and its crew airlifted a badly
burned seaman straight to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital.
   A Sea King helicopter from Coltishall flew firemen with
breathing apparatus out to the ferry and was quickly joined by a
third helicopter, this time from Lee on Solent.
   Belgian helicopters stood by in Ostend to airlift passengers and
crew from the ship if asked, but there were no plans for such an
operation.
   Ramsgate and Dover lifeboats were launched, the BBC said. The
Pride of Kent, a P and O ferry, was also reported on the way.
   On March 6, 1987, 193 people died when the British channel ferry
Herald of Free Enterprise capsized in the North Sea off Zeebrugge.
Water poured through the bow doors, which had been left open as the
vessel pulled out of Zeebrugge.
   The Seafreight Freeway ferry, built in 1981 and capable of
carrying around 70 trucks, has been on charter to Sealink since
mid-1986, operating between Dover and Zeebrugge and Dover and
Dunkirk.
   ``Information is a bit sketchy at the moment because the ship's
radio is tied up with emergency messages,'' Sealink spokesman Brian
Kelly said.
   ``The urgent thing is to ensure that the drivers and the crew
are not in danger.''

<TEXT>
   A heavily traveled bridge near New York
City is believed to contain the first pair of peregrine falcons
discovered nesting along the Hudson River in three decades, an
animal expert said Monday.
   The falcons' behavior indicates they are tending to nestlings in
a box placed by conservationists in a tower of the Tappan Zee
Bridge along the New York Thruway, said Dennis Mildner, curator of
Museum of the Hudson Highlands in Cornwall-on-Hudson.
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation and Cornell
University have been trying since 1974 to reestablish peregrine
falcons by releasing more than 160 young peregrines raised in
captivity in the hopes they will mate.
   Conservationists know of at least 10 mating pairs in New York
state, including two pairs on other New York City bridges.
   Mildner said people and pesticides have disturbed the
peregrines' traditional nesting areas in cliffs above the Hudson,
but that nesting perches in bridges afford a clifflike environment.

   Architects Oscar Niemeyer of Brazil and Gordon
Bunshaft of the United States have been named 1988 co-winners of
the Pirtzker Architecture Prize, sponsored by the Hyatt Foundation.
   The prize was established by the Pritzker family of Chicago in
1979 to honor a creative endeavor not included in the Nobel prizes.
It includes a $100,000 grant, formal citation certificates and
medallions.
   Niemeyer, 80, and Bunshaft, 79, will share the grant equally,
the foundation said in a statement.
   Niemeyer, a native of Rio de Janiero, is perhaps best known for
his designs for most of the public buildings in Brasilia, the
Brazilian capital. He also designed, in collaboration with the late
French architect Le Courbusier, the United Nations headquarters in
New York City.
   A communist since 1945, Niemeyer was the 1962 recipient of the
Lenin Peace Prize.
   Bunshaft was born in Buffalo, N.Y., and educated at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In his work for the firm of
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Bunshaft became famous for his
skyscrapers of the 1950s, many in New York City.
   Bunshaft's 24-story Lever House there, finished in 1953, is the
most contemporary building to be granted landmark status by the New
York Landmarks Conservancy.
   Other New York buildings designed by Bunshaft include the
60-story Chase Manhattan Bank, the Union Carbide Building and the
original PepsiCo building.
   He also designed the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., the
Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Texas and the Albright-Knox Art
Gallery in his native Buffalo, as well as buildings in Belgium,
Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

   Patience is the key to working with legendary
actress Bette Davis, whose unexpected comings and goings on the set
of the film ``Wicked Stepmother'' have created a stir, says the
movie's producer-director.
   ``She's 80 and you have to be patient with her because you do
get a great performance and it is Bette Davis,'' Larry Cohen said.
   ``Everything's amicable. She's coming back,'' Cohen said in an
interview last week. The actress is due on the set this week.
   Miss Davis left Los Angeles just as filming was beginning on
``Wicked Stepmother.''
   Besides, Cohen said of the stir caused by her departure, ``Any
publicity is good publicity.''
   ``It was basically a health problem. If you're not feeling well
and things are bothering you _ like dental problems _ it's hard to
work. Now that that's been taken care of, she's coming back.''

   A man described as mentally unstable
hijacked a Colombian jet with 135 people aboard Monday and forced
it to fly to Panama and Aruba after letting the passengers off. The
plane later returned to Colombia where the man vanished.
   The captain of the Avianca airlines Boeing 727 said the hijacker
apparently jumped off the plane as it was rolling toward the
terminal Monday night at the international airport in Cartagena on
Colombia's Carribbean coast.
   The plane was hijacked on a domestic flight Monday morning after
it took off from Medellin in northwest Colombia. It returned to
Medellin, where 131 people were allowed off, then was forced to go
to Panama, where it refueled, and to Aruba, an island off the coast
of Venezuela.
   No one was injured.
   The captain, Luis Eduardo Gutierrez, told the Colombian radio
chain Caracol that he informed the hijacker the plane did not have
enough fuel to reach Cuba, the man's intended destination.
   Libardo Arteaga, Avianca's spokesman in Cartagena, told radio
chain RCN that no one in Cartagena _ neither police nor the control
tower _ knew the plane was coming.
   As the plane was taxiing in the darkness toward the runway in
Cartagena, the captain said, the crew noticed a light in the cabin
indicating that the plane's rear stairway had been lowered.
   When the plane pulled up to the terminal at the Rafael Nunez
International Airport, police rushed aboard but could not find the
hijacker, Gutierrez said.
   The hijacker, who had gripped a hand grenade throughout,
apparently fled in the darkness, Gutierrez said. Police searched
slums and a swampy area around the airport.
   Authorities identified the hijacker as Albeiro Jimenez, a
Colombian, Gutierrez said. He had no further information about the
man's identity.
   Edgar Lozano, security chief for the Colombian Civil Aeronautics
Administration, said the plane landed in Cartagena at 6:57 p.m.
(7:57 p.m. EDT).
   The craft took off from Aruba at 6:15 p.m. EDT with almost no
warning. The pilot radioed the control tower from 16,000 feet that
he was heading for Cuba, said Michael Dijkhoff, public relations
manager at Reina Beatrix International Airport.
   It was not clear why the pilot relayed that information.
   Dijkhoff said in a telephone interview that the sudden takeoff
``was a surprise. Radio communication was cut off. All of a sudden,
the engines started and the plane took off.''
   The hijacker was said to be carrying a pistol and two hand
grenades in a suitcase. The pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer
were captive aboard.
   The Boeing 727 landed in Aruba at 3:45 p.m. EDT after being
refueled in Panama.
   On and off for the next 2{ hours, authorities talked with the
hijacker by radio. Dijkhoff said the man repeated demands he made
in Colombia and Panama for $100,000 and safe passage to Cuba.
   The plane was neither refueled nor resupplied in this tiny
autonomous member of the kingdom of the Netherlands, Dijkhoff said.
   The air pirate told authorities in Panama that he wanted to go
to Havana after stopping in Aruba, to pick up the ransom money,
said Capt. Miguel von Seidlitz, security chief at Omar Torrijos
International Airport near Panama City.
   At Medellin, about 200 miles southeast of Bogota, 131 people,
including three flight attendants, were allowed to leave the plane,
said Yezid Castano, the Colombian Civil Aeronautics Administration
chief.
   Earlier, Capt. Edgard Lozano, the administration's security
chief, said 135 people got off at Medellin.
   Eduardo Guerrero, administrator at the Panamanian airport, told
reporters in Panama City that the man was ``desquiciado'' _ Spanish
for mentally unbalanced. Von Seidlitz also said the hijacker
``could be crazy.''
   Castano told a news conference in Bogota the hijacker said he
wanted the money because he is suffering from a fatal disease and
wants to spend his last days happily.
   The hijacker demanded the money in Panama, but because of a
banking crisis there the hijacker was told that payment was
impossible, Castano said.
   Castano said released passengers reported the hijacker was
short, blond, dressed in sports clothes and appeared to be about 30
years old.
   ``Everything happened very fast, but there was no panic,''
passenger Luis Fernando Piedrahita told the Caracol network.
   Another passenger, Javier Robledo, said he sat next to the
hijacker, who gave a note to a flight attendant and she led him to
the cockpit, Robledo told Caracol.
   ``Both the hijacker and the flight attendant were very
nervous,'' Robledo said. ``Nothing happened, and 10 minutes after
going back to the airport the pilot told everyone they should get
off the plane.''

<HEAD>Far Right Walk Out on First South African Joint Debates in
Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White and non-white members of
Parliament took part in joint debates Monday for the first time.
Members of the far-right Conservative Party walked out in protest.
   The party said in a statement the members wanted to ``record
anew our deep-felt rejection of being co-governed by other
population groups.''
   The debates dealt with the budgets of South Africa's four
provinces and were conducted in the provincial capitals by members
of the relevant committees in the white, Asian and mixed-race
chambers of Parliament.
   The government, in revising parliamentary rules to allow the
joint debates, stopped short of permitting joint voting on any
issues.
   ``Until we can debate and vote together, this meeting today is
an historical farce,'' said Marius Barnard of the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party.
   The Asian and mixed-race chambers were created in 1984 under a
new constitution which continued to exclude the black majority from
national affairs.
   The white chamber, dominated by President P.W. Botha's National
Party, is able to get its way on all major legislative issues. The
Conservative Party, with 23 of 178 seats, is the largest white
opposition party.
   In Pretoria, where the Transvaal Province budget was debated,
several legislators objected to stringent security checks conducted
as they entered the meeting hall.
   ``We cannot allow ourselves to be subjected to such demeaning
checks,'' said Yusuf Seedat of the Asian chamber after he and other
lawmakers were ordered to empty their pockets, offer their
briefcases to be searched, and produce their parliamentary identity
cards.
   During the debates, government officials pledged to expand black
hospital facilities, suggested that new laws would be enacted to
control black squatters, and reported that the first ``recreation
resort'' for blacks in the Orange Free State would be ready next
year.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A former professor suing to become the fifth woman
granted tenure in the Harvard Business School's 80-year history
testified Monday that the academic guidelines were manipulated to
deny her tenure because of her sex.
   Barbara Bund Jackson, 44, who resigned in 1984, is asking U.S.
District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock to reinstate her with tenure and
award $847,000 in lost income.
   Manipulation of the tenure process and the use of review
procedures different from those used for men are ``the absolute
core of the discrimination,'' Ms. Jackson testified in the first
day of her non-jury trial.
   Ms. Jackson has also charged that the school destroyed documents
requested by her to support her claim that less-qualified men
received tenure from 1974 to 1984.
   Harvard maintains in court papers that Ms. Jackson's academic
work was substandard and that the tenure records were unwittingly
destroyed by someone outside the business school.
   Ms. Jackson testified she was pressured into submitting new
examples of her scholarship sooner than it was required. She also
asserted that a faculty member threatened not to support her in her
tenure bid because of conflicts over what material a course should
cover.
   ``I believe this was done with the express purpose of
discriminating against me on the basis of sex,'' she testified.
   Ms. Jackson was asked repeatedly to cite specific incidents of
sex bias she alleged against several faculty members. When she was
unable to on one occasion, she said:
   ``To me bias is a spectrum and I don't know where to draw the
line in that spectrum,'' she said.
   In court papers, the school said that Ms. Jackson was given a
``virtually unprecedented'' second chance after she was denied
tenure in 1981 and that the faculty voted by just 36-31 to support
her 1983 bid, a low margin. A tenure committee rejected her.
   Tenure decisions at Harvard are submitted to the faculty to
gauge support for the professor. The actual decision rests with the
university president, who receives a recommendation from the
school's dean.
   ``She was given an extremely thorough and fair review in 1981
and 1983 and the decision was made entirely on her academic
qualifications,'' Allan A. Ryan Jr., an attorney for Harvard, said
in court papers.
   Ms. Jackson, a marketing consultant, began teaching at Harvard
as an assistant professor in 1973. She was promoted to associate
professor in 1977.
   In her first attempt at tenure, she failed to win support of the
faculty, which cited inadequate scholarship. Ms. Jackson was given
a three-year extension on her appointment and submitted new
academic work for review.
   Three of the 90 business school's tenured professors are women.
Four women have received tenure in the business school's history,
the first in 1961. The school said 27 percent of the 819 students
in the class of 1988 were women.
   Legal experts say few gender bias cases make it to trial, and
plaintiffs have won even fewer cases because judges are reluctant
to rule on matters of academic merit.
   Nationally, 72 percent of male faculty members have tenure
compared with 45 percent of females, according to a recent survey
of 1,055 two- and four-year institutions by the American
Association of University Professors.

   The Supreme Court heard an appeal Monday by an
Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience who asked the judges
to revoke a deportation order against him.
   He threatened to convert to Judaism and return to Israel if the
order stands.
   Mubarak Awad, 44, was ordered deported by Israeli officials on
May 6. They said he had played a leading role in the 24-week Arab
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The three-judge panel reserved decision after Monday's appeal
hearing, but did not set a date for its ruling. The decision is
expected to have far-reaching consequences for the legal status of
the 130,000 Arabs living in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
   During the three-hour hearing, lawyers for both sides focused on
Awad's legal status under Israeli immigration law.
   The court must consider whether the Jerusalem-born Awad and
other east Jerusalem Arabs enjoy an irrevocable status as permanent
residents, or if they can lose their rights under certain
conditions, such as leaving the country for more than seven years.
   Nili Arad, an attorney for the Interior Ministry, argued that
Awad should be deported because he forfeited his right to permanent
residency by leaving Israel for 13 years, from 1970 to 1983, and by
accepting U.S. citizenship. Awad lived in Wapakoneta, Ohio, while
maintaining a home in Jerusalem.
   Awad's attorney, Avraham Gal, said Israel had no right to deport
his client because, as a longtime resident of Arab east Jerusalem,
Awad enjoys a special status that cannot be revoked.
   Israel annexed east Jerusalem after the 1967 Middle East war,
but never defined the legal status of the sector's Arab residents,
most of whom rejected offers of Israeli citizenship.
   Ms. Arad argued that since the annexation, the Interior Ministry
in practice has applied the rules of permanent residency to
citizens of east Jerusalem, and that Awad falls into that category.
   If the court rules in favor of the Interior Ministry, ``all east
Jerusalemites are in danger of mass transfer,'' said Jonathan
Kuttab, a West Bank lawyer also representing the Arab-American.
   ``Those who grant residency permits can also take them away,''
he added.
   Awad, who has been jailed since May 5, looked pale when he
entered the packed courtroom wearing a beige suit and a
blue-striped shirt. He kissed his American-born wife, Nancy Nye,
and talked to reporters during recess.
   Awad rejected government allegations that he had helped incite
often violent anti-Israeli protests. He said he stood by his
advocacy of non-violent action such as tax boycotts and strikes.
   He also said Israel's effort to deport him has helped popularize
his ideas. ``My ideas have caught, thanks to the Israelis who put
so much pressure on me,'' Awad said.
   However, Awad seems fairly isolated in the Palestinian
community, and underground leaders have not mentioned his case in
the leaflets they distribute in the occupied lands.
   Asked what he would do if deported, he told reporters he had the
option of converting to Judaism and coming back under Israel's Law
of Return, which grants automatic Israeli citizenship to all Jews.
Awad is Christian.
   Awad's troubles began in August when the Interior Ministry
refused to renew his identity card, issued by Israel in 1968. Since
his return from the United States in 1983, Awad had stayed in
Israel on tourist visas stamped into his U.S. passport, but in
November the Interior Ministry refused to renew that permit.

   The Supreme Court on Monday overruled a
decision by the Tel Aviv City Council barring women from voting for
the city's chief rabbi.
   The court ordered the council to hold new elections for its 10
delegates to the 30-member body which will elect the chief rabbi
and warned it not to discriminate against women.
   The city's Labor Party faction last year elected two women,
Haviva Avigai and Lili Menachem, to the elective body. The council
nullified the choices under pressure from orthodox leaders, who
said religious law forbade women from electing rabbis.
   Rabbi Yisrael Lau, Mayor Shlomo Lahat's choice for the vacant
post, said at the time he would not submit his candidacy if women
were on the elective body.
   Ms. Avigai hailed Monday's decision. ``The Supreme Court has
again shown it is the guardian of human rights and that women have
equal rights,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Lau told Israel Television: ``We have a problem. It has been
customary to choose someone to fill a traditional post in a
traditional way.''
   Tel Aviv has been without an Ashkenazi chief rabbi, one
representing Jews of European descent, since late 1986 because of
squabbling over female representation.
   Monday's decision was the latest in a series which have pitted
the secular law of the land against Israel's religious
establishment.
   The court also went against the rabbis' wishes last week, when
it upheld the appointment of Lea Shakdiel, the first woman
nominated to serve on a religious council in Israel.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Deplore Anti-Semitism in Italy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's Roman Catholic bishops on Monday deplored
recent demonstrations of anti-Semitism that have apparently
occurred in reaction to Israel's policies toward Palestinians.
   The statement by the Italian Bishops' Conference followed
charges by Jewish leaders that the Italian press, including Roman
Catholic publications, have helped incite anti-Semitism through
their reporting on the Middle East conflict.
   The bishops' statement, published in the Vatican daily
L'Osservatore Romano and carried by Vatican Radio, made no direct
reference to the allegations by Jewish officials. But it strongly
urged Catholics to distinguish between the Jewish people and the
policies of the Israeli government or political parties.
   ``The tensions between Palestinians and Israelis continue to
provoke in the Italian milieu, and therefore also among Catholics,
grave preoccupations for the risk of distortions of information and
consequent emotive reactions, which in the extremist fringes, can
explode into violence,'' the statement said.
   ``Anti-Semitism in Italy seems to some a marginal phenomomen and
uncharacteristic of Italian society,'' it added. ``Still, episodes
of intolerance against Jews and Jewish institutions, occurring even
recently ... provoke in our community feelings of profound
preoccupation for the risk of painful civil and religious
lacerations that can derive from them.''
   The statement also stressed the need to ``promote a dialogue
between Jews, Christians and Moslems and to be builders of peace
together.''
   Last week, Rome's chief rabbi, Elio Toaff, and Jacob Sabban,
president of the Jewish community, held a news conference to detail
recent anti-Semitic incidents in Italy. Among other things, they
displayed packs of anonymous and threatening letters and dozens of
photos of swastikas painted on walls.
   The two said the media, including Catholic publications, fueled
anti-Semitic feelings in Italy with reports from the Middle East
that tend to compare Israelis to Nazis because of the Israelis'
policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Vatican earlier expressed ``surprise'' at the Jewish
allegations and noted that Pope John Paul II has often spoken out
against anti-Semitism.
   Riots began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. At least 194 Arabs have been
killed, and an Israeli soldier and Jewish settler also have been
slain.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a U.S.-Soviet treaty
reducing long-range nuclear weapons could be signed by January but
that he will not set aside disputes over the ``Star Wars'' program
to reach such an accord.
   The Soviet leader also said his policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, includes freedom of speech, but he condemned a leading
dissident as a ``parasite'' and accused him of ``sponging on the
democratic process.''
   Gorbachev's comments came in a pre-summit interview with two
American news organizations. The Soviet news agency Tass on Sunday
ran a partial transcript of the interview with The Washington Post
and Newsweek.

   Saying ``what's passed has passed,''
defrocked evangelist Jimmy Swaggart ended his three-month exile
from the pulpit but conceded that not everyone will forgive him for
his sins with a prostitute.
   ``I am sure there will be many ... that will see to it that I
don't forget. I realize it will be the hardest task,'' Swaggart
said Sunday.
   In his first sermon since tearfully confessing on Feb. 21 to
unspecified sins, the television evangelist reclaimed his pulpit
with fire-and-brimstone fervor before 5,000 followers.
   ``Once you look up into his (God's) face, you will never be any
cleaner than you are right now,'' Swaggart said.

   New regulations to reshape the Farmers Home
Administration's loan policies will cost $8.7 billion and push as
many as 64,800 farmers into liquidation or foreclosure, the agency
says.
   The FmHA, an agency of the Agriculture Department, is scheduled
to open the proposed changes to public comment this week. A summary
of the agency's proposal was made available to The Associated Press.
   Cheryl Cook, a lobbyist and lawyer for the National Farmers
Union, said she had not had an opportunity to study the FmHA's
proposal in detail but indicated that the figures cited by the
agency appeared to be in line with estimates.
   ``If they had used the authority that they had gotten in the
1985 farm (law) to restructure this debt, we wouldn't be in a
situation now where it was too late for 64,800 people,'' she said.

   A new state law allowing students to choose
their schools will improve education, proponents say. But some
educators fear the plan could hurt smaller schools and bring
unhealthy competition.
   ``We realize there may be some poor choice-making in the free
market, but the challenge is to educate parents in how to make
sound choices,'' says Nan Skelton, assistant state education
commissioner.
   The measure gives Minnesota the nation's broadest open
enrollment plan, Skelton said. Schools may refuse students only if
the transfer would interfere with desegregation ratios in
Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth, or if the school is too crowded.
   State funding, about $3,000 per youngster, follows the student
to the new district. Previously, parents had to pay tuition to the
new district.

   Six sailors accused of drowning a recruit
in a training course face a public hearing this week as Navy
officials denied charges by the man's family that they were slow to
investigate his death.
   Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died March 2
after instructors allegedly dragged him into a pool against his
will and held his head underwater after he failed a rescue drill.
   Other recruits reportedly were told to turn their backs to the
pool and sing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as loudly as they could
to drown out Mirecki's screams for help.

   Congress has provided for a state-of-the-art
civilian air and sea force to hunt down drug boats and planes even
as lawmakers try to draft a reluctant Pentagon to lead the fight
against narcotics smugglers.
   Customs Service and Coast Guard patrols use some of the nation's
most sophisticated radars, patrol boats and aircraft. Customs has
helicopters with ``bust'' teams that swoop down on drug planes as
soon as they touch down.
   The Customs air wing now has 87 aircraft, 37 of them with the
sophisticated equipment or speed to spot a suspicious aircraft,
track it on radar, pursue it, and move in for the kill with Army
Blackhawk helicopters.
   A P3 turboprop surveillance plane to be delivered to Customs
next month will have high-tech radar with a full 360-degree range.
Customs has four other P3s with sophisticated radar systems.
   Customs also operates four tethered radar balloons, called
aerostats, and has four on order for the nation's Southwest border
from Texas to California _ currently the most porous area in air
coverage against drug smugglers.

<HEAD>Three American Journalists Honored in China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three American writers, ostracized and ignored in
their own country during their lifetimes, have an organization in
China dedicated to remembering their contributions to the communist
revolution.
   The Smedley-Strong-Snow Society of China, a wing of the
prestigious Academy of Social Sciences, was founded in 1984 to
honor the three Midwesterners who were among the first to tell the
world of the cataclysmic events in China in the 1920s and '30s.
   The most famous of the trio is Edgar Snow (1905-72), the first
Westerner to interview Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai in the caves of
their guerrilla stronghold in northwest China, and author of ``Red
Star Over China,'' his classic account of the communist leadership.
   He is joined by Agnes Smedley (1892-1950), a fiery supporter of
revolutionary causes; and Anna Louise Strong (1885-1970),
chronicler of socialist upheaval in both the Soviet Union and China.
   In June, the ``3-S Society'' marks the 50th anniversary of the
publication of ``Red Star Over China'' with a major symposium on
the book at Beijing University.
   The society, made up of more than 100 scholars and writers who
knew the three Americans or studied their works, is also holding an
essay contest on the book, and will invite students from schools in
Beijing, Shanghai and Kansas City, Snow's hometown, to attend the
symposium.
   ``We want young people to read history, to find out how China
traversed this road and reached this stage,'' said former Foreign
Minister Huang Hua, president of the ``3-S Society.''
   Huang, Snow's interpreter when he interviewed Mao Tse-tung, said
young Chinese read too many books of ``love, martial arts and
adventure.'' Works of people such as Snow ``should be popularized
so their contributions to the Chinese cause will not be forgotten.''
   Snow arrived in Shanghai in 1927 for a planned six-week visit
and stayed nearly 14 years. In one of journalism's greatest scoops,
he found his way to the Red army headquarters in northwest China's
Baoan in 1936 and spent five months observing and talking to Mao
and his fellow communists.
   He was the first Western journalist to break the news blockade
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists had imposed on the communists. ``Red
Star,'' published in Britain in 1937 and in Shanghai and the United
States the next year, became the seminal work on the band of
revolutionaries who were to change the face of China.
   His book gave not only the West but also many Chinese their
first detailed look at the communist leaders, and many
intellectuals trekked to communist headquarters after reading it.
   ``It's hard to imagine what our image of China would be today
without Edgar Snow,'' said former New York Times reporter Harrison
Salisbury, a prominent writer on the Soviet Union and China.
   Salisbury said Snow, whom he met in the Soviet Union in World
War II, ``had been my hero as he had been the hero of a whole
generation of newspaper men.''
   Snow left China in 1941 and worked around the world as a roving
correspondent for such publications as the Saturday Evening Post,
the Chicago Tribune and the New York Herald Tribune.
   In 1959, after years of being hounded by anti-communist
McCarthyites, he left the United States for Switzerland. But he was
to make one last contribution to his native land: In 1970, Mao told
Snow that China would welcome a visit by then-President Nixon,
setting the stage for Nixon's historic trip in 1972.
   China showed its respect for Snow by sending a medical team to
Geneva in a futile attempt to save the life of the dying writer in
1972. Some of his ashes are buried in New York and some on a
university campus in Beijing where he once taught.
   Unlike Snow, who was never a Marxist, the two women writers were
outspoken in their support for leftist causes. Smedley, born into
poverty in St. Joseph, Mo., and raised in mining towns, was a
strong advocate of women's rights and anti-colonial struggles in
Germany, India and China.
   She worked with Sun Yat-sen's widow, Soong Ching-ling, and
China's most famous modern writer, Lu Xun. She wrote a biography of
Red army commander Zhu De and, in 1937 in the communist camp at
Yenan, taught Chou En-lai and other communists to square dance.
   In 1949, a U.S. Army report accused her of spying for the
Soviets, and she died in London in 1950 while trying to get back to
China.
   Strong, a native of Friend, Neb., was a pacifist opponent of
World War I and left for the newly founded Soviet Union in 1921.
   A resident of Moscow for almost 30 years, she wrote some 30
books on revolutions around the world. She, too, made her way to
Yenan in 1937, and interviewed Mao in 1946 when he made his famous
statement, ``All reactionaries are paper tigers.''
   She was arrested as a spy and expelled from the Soviet Union in
1949, only to be further attacked on her return to the United
States for her communist leanings. She died in Beijing at age 84
during the extreme leftist Cultural Revolution, isolated in her
last haven by the suspicion that prevailed then against all
foreigners.
   Dong Leshan, translator of a 1980 edition of ``Red Star Over
China'' that sold 1.3 million copies in China, said the works of
the three writers were not always welcomed in China.
   ``After the revolution Snow was still taboo because he told the
real story of the party. Some in the party took a negative view of
this,'' he said.
   It was only after the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, Dong
said, that ``Red Star'' and Snow found acceptance.

<HEAD>West Germans Worried by NATO's Tree-Skimming Warplanes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BORKEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fighter jet swoops about 250 feet
over farmer Bernh Buschmann and his wife Anna. The roar spooks
their horse and scatters the hens across the barnyard.
   NATO warplanes skimming over trees, farms and villages in mock
battles have been a common sight in West Germany for years.
   Airmen from seven nations in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, including West Germany, take part in a total of
70,000 low-level training flights in this country each year, more
than in any other NATO land, according to the West German Defense
Ministry.
   But thousands of West Germans now are saying they've had enough
of it.
   ``I know the defense of our country is important, but these
low-level fliers are annoying,'' said the 56-year-old Buschmann,
whose farm is just outside Borken near the Dutch-West German border.
   ``Those jets are really a nuisance, and the animals don't care
too much for them either,'' said his wife.
   On one recent day, about 50 military jets were in the air over
the Borken area, many of them in low-level maneuvers.
   Opposition to the low-level flights soared after two recent
crashes. On March 30 a French fighter jet crashed near a nuclear
power plant in Bavaria. A day later, a U.S. F-16 plummeted into a
West German town, destroying homes and killing a resident.
   About 60,000 West Germans belong to grass-roots organizations
pressuring the federal government to do something about low-level
military flights, activists say.
   West Germans complain such flights give them nightmares, impair
their hearing, cause high blood pressure and make their children
irritable.
   ``I get these very ugly dreams,'' said Daerbel Stechel, a
45-year-old activist who lives in Wischhafen near Bremen and hears
NATO jet fighters screeching overhead nearly every day.
   ``In one of them, I'm swimming in a very beautiful lake and
suddenly jet fighters are falling all around me into the water.
This is very bad,'' she said.
   Earlier this year, the respected Wickert Institute polled West
Germans and found that 15 percent want NATO to stop its low-level
military training flights.
   Two-thirds of the 1,710 people polled said such flights were
necessary but that the number should be reduced, the institute said.
   ``Most people who oppose these flights are not members of the
Greens (West Germany's environmentalist party), but just citizens
who cannot stand the noise any longer,'' said Udo Rinner, a
45-year-old engineer and activist who lives in Muenster.
   ``For example, I am a conservative and am vehemently against the
low-level flights.''
   The low-level runs, in which the warplanes fly at altitudes as
low as 250 feet, are limited to seven areas less densely populated
than other parts of the country. Five areas are in the north half
and two in the south.
   Forty percent of the low-level flights are by the West German
air force, said Ruediger Jaeschke, a spokesman for the West German
Defense Ministry.
   The remainder are flown by Americans, British, Dutch, French,
Canadians and Norwegians, he said.
   All NATO flights in West Germany are coordinated by a West
German air force's control center in Porz, which is between Cologne
and Bonn.
   The NATO allies refuse to divulge how many warplanes are based
in West Germany, which is temporary home to about 900,000 foreign
soldiers.
   Jaeschke said the low-level flights are important for NATO's
defense of West Germany.
   He added that NATO is considering a ``midday break'' of a couple
hours a day when the jets would have to stay on the ground.
   In addition, he said, the NATO allies are always looking for new
technological means to soften the jets' roar.
   ``Much has been done in the last few years to lower the level of
the noise from the jets,'' Jaeschke said.
   But he strongly rejected activists' views that low-level flights
should be stopped.
   The Warsaw Pact, the Soviet bloc's defense alliance, has a
numerical advantage over NATO in several areas, Jaeschke said. ``If
our pilots train too little, the Warsaw Pact advantage becomes
greater.''
   U.S. Air Force authorities also say low-level training flights
are necessary.
   ``They are required to provide realistic training to NATO air
crews,'' Maj. Gen. Richard Pascoe, commander of the 17th Air Force
at Sembach Air Base near Kaiserslautern, said.
   ``We must train the way we expect to fight.''

<HEAD>Rod Steiger Is Heavy in NBC Western ``Desperado''</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Academy Award-winner Rod Steiger says it was
his character's ``Lolita''-like relationship with a young girl that
attracted him to the latest ``Desperado'' movie.
   Steiger plays Silas Slaten, a mine owner who offers to free
roving cowboy Duell McCall from jail and a trumped-up murder charge
if McCall will lead the search party to find Slaten's abducted
``daughter.''
   McCall, played by Alex McArthur, is the ``Desperado'' in this
third movie in the series. Author Elmore Leonard wrote the first
movie about a young cowboy who's a fugitive from a phony charge.
The latest film, ``Desperado: Avalanche at Devil's Ridge,'' airs
tonight on NBC.
   ``My character has an obsession with this girl,'' said Steiger.
``That's what interested me the most, this relationship with the
girl. It made me think of `Lolita.' Everybody thinks the girl's my
daughter, but she's not.''
   Slaten is the heavy of the film, but Steiger said he doesn't
play him that way.
   ``I just think of him as a character to play,'' he said. ``Let
the audience be the judge. I think the mistake a lot of actors make
when they play a heavy is to go through the boards.
   ``Every human being has something he wants. If the something I
want makes me a criminal, then I become the heavy. I wonder how
many times I've been killed in films. I know it's at least 60
times. In early live television I was killed every week, it seems.''
   Steiger, who won an Oscar as best actor in 1967 for ``In the
Heat of the Night,'' has been in only a few Westerns, although he
professes a love for the genre. He starred in ``A Fistful of
Dynamite,'' ``Jubal'' and ``Cattle Annie and Little Britches.'' He
also starred in the 1955 movie version of the musical ``Oklahoma!''
playing Jud Fry, the bad guy in conflict with cowhand Curly, played
by Gordon MacRae.
   Steiger came out of the Navy after World War II with no thought
of acting. ``I saw all the pretty girls going into the theater
program,'' he said. `I had the GI Bill and could take acting
lessons. I got $85 a month, lived in New York and had a good time.
   ``But I fell in love with acting and became a fanatic. I kept
telling myself not to get a job. You're not an actor yet. So I
spent two years learning my profession. Then `Philco Playhouse'
called and offered me a few lines as a mechanic.''
   For the next several years, he acted both on Broadway and in the
``golden age'' of live television drama. He was ``Marty'' on
television, the drama that as a movie brought an Oscar to Ernest
Borgnine.
   ``I thought I was going to do the movie,'' Steiger said, ``but
they wanted me to sign a seven-year contract. I said no. Two days
later I got the part of Jud in `Oklahoma! I'd tested for the role
of Curly with an unknown actor named Paul Newman. Then I tested in
the afternoon with James Dean for Jud.''
   ``In the Heat of the Night'' has now become a series on NBC.
Carroll O'Connor plays the role Steiger had in the film. Steiger
was not offered the role, but he said,``I don't know if I would
have taken it. I didn't want to be in a rut. I wish they had called
me, however, because my ego demands that.''
   Steiger has had an illustrious career. He was Marlon Brando's
corrupt brother in ``On the Waterfront.'' He played the title role
in ``Al Capone.'' He was Napoleon in ``Waterloo.'' He also starred
in ``Dr. Zhivago,'' ``The Pawnbroker'' and ``Hands Upon the City.''
His recent television credits include Pontius Pilate in ``Jesus of
Nazareth'' and Arctic explorer Robert E. Peary in ``Cook and Peary:
The Race to the Pole.''

<HEAD>Rise in Ivory Prices Brings Surge in Elephant Slaughter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp rise in ivory prices has brought a
surge in the slaughter of elephants by poachers in Kenya's Tsavo
National Park.
   The slaughter, which over the years has seen more than 80
percent of the park's herd perish, will continue until the illegal
ivory trade is halted, said Esmond Bradley-Martin, an American
conservationist who has lived in Kenya for nearly 25 years and is
an expert on elephant ivory and rhino horn trade.
   ``The short-term prognosis for elephants is dim,'' he said.
``People realize ivory is worth a lot outside the country. They
essentially are raping a natural resource.''
   Prices have reached $73 a pound, up from about $20 a pound five
years ago, he said.
   An aerial survey in February of Tsavo and its surrounding
ecosystem found 5,363 elephants, about a third the number at the
beginning of the decade.
   The herd is about one-sixth the estimated 35,000 that remained
in 1974 after a five-year drought killed 9,000, according to the
survey sponsored by the European Economic Commission, the East
African Wildlife Society and the Kenyan government.
   Most of the bleached bones and rotted carcasses spotted in the
15,385-square-mile area were of elephants killed more than a year
ago, according to the survey.
   Tedd Goss, coordinator of anti-poaching efforts for Kenya's
Ministry of Wildlife, credited intensified efforts by reinforced
anti-poaching units in Tsavo with keeping the slaughter from
getting even worse.
   The slaughter of elephants by poachers is not confined to Kenya
and at the current rate of killings, Africa's elephants could
conceivably be wiped out in eight to 10 years.
   But experts say it is not likely the world's biggest land animal
will be hunted into extinction. They explained the elephants will
continue to retreat to protected areas or deep into forests, making
it more difficult for poachers to find them.
   However, the Tsavo slaughter dramatizes an alarming decline in
elephant populations already evident from detailed counts taken of
East Africa's closely studied herds.
   Studies by the Nairobi-based United Nations Environmental
Program (UNEP) indicate a drop in population since 1973 of 85
percent in Kenya and 89 percent in neighborng Uganda. Another
neighbor Tanzania, has lost 53 percent of its elephants in the last
10 years.
   ``Everyone knows that for years poachers have been killing
elephants for ivory,'' Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a Scottish elephant
expert in Nairobi, wrote recently in Swara, the East African
Wildlife Society's bi-monthly magazine.
   ``What nobody appears to be aware of, other than a few wardens
and wildlife scientists, is the extent of the destruction of
elephants in East Africa and how fast the remaining elephants are
disappearing.''
   Douglas-Hamilton, who helped assemble the UNEP data, said
information is scanty for the rest of Africa. But he added that
available information paints a picture that is similar to or worse
than the elephants' situation in East Africa.
   An estimated 750,000 elephants remain in all of Africa, down
from about 1.3 million in the late 1970s, according to
Bradely-Martin. The amount of ivory traded in the world market
through 1985 averaged about 800 tons a year, representing an
offtake of about 75,000 elephants annually, he said.
   He estimated that an additional 100 tons remains in Africa where
it is ``carved up and sold on the tourist market.''
   In the mid-1980s, perhaps 50 percent of all ivory leaving Africa
was illegal, according to Bradley-Martin, who said more current
data were not available.
   Legal ivory is that which has been obtained through sanctioned
culls of elephant herds, or from natural deaths.
   ``There is absolutely no way poaching could continue without
senior collaboration in governments and business,'' Bradley-Martin
said.
   In January, Kenya's Ministry of Wildlife fired seven officials
and disciplined eight field officers suspected of helping poachers
or embezzling funds. It also named a new director.
   Hong Kong also is cracking down on the illegal ivory market
there and has imposed heavy fines and jail terms for people
convicted of importing raw ivory without a license.
   Hong Kong and Japan are the world's largest consumers of ivory,
along with the United States, which is considering legislation that
would stop almost all ivory imports.
   Douglas-Hamilton believes the elephant slaughter will stop only
when the ivory trade is banned altogether.
   ``Don't buy it, don't wear it, don't sell it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   After six months in office, Premier Li Peng
remains something of a mystery _ perhaps not an exciting one.
   Universally described as methodically attuned to solving
problems rather than politicking, the 59-year-old Li is generally
regarded as bland but the kind of leader China needs to solve
problems slowing the decade-old modernization drive.
   Overshadowed by his predecessor, the urbane and nattily dressed
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, and without power to
singlehandedly formulate policy, Li has yet to offer any bold
initiatives.
   He has given few clues to his own vision of China's future or
his goals as premier, other than reducing an 11 percent inflation
rate.
   Although he is one of the five members of the Communist Party
Politburo's Standing Committee, China's most powerful policy-making
body, Li has been exceptionally cautious in public statements.
   He remains dogged by a widely held assumption that he owes his
job to nepotism _ he is the adopted son of the late Premier Chou
En-lai. His rise to the premiership was meteoric. He was appointed
acting premier in November, just eight years after being given his
first government post, minister of power.
   The National People's Congress, China's legislature, confirmed
him as premier in April.
   A few days later, he became the target of satirical attacks in
posters put up by students at Beijing University.
   ``If Li Peng can become premier, who can't?'' said one.
   Li's main credentials for the job were his technical skills and
connections. Trained as an engineer in the Soviet Union, he spent
most of his career running power projects and never ran a city or
provincial government.
   After becoming minister of power in 1979, he rose in rapid
succession to vice premier in 1983, Politburo member in 1985 and
education minister later that year. As education minister, he
escaped responsibilty for the widespread pro-democracy student
demonstrations of 1986-87, saving himself by denouncing liberal
intellectuals.
   Many intellectuals dislike him for that and for his failure to
improve their salaries and living conditions.
   However, unpopularity is the least of Li's problems because
China's premiers are selected by party leaders, not the ballot box.
   He must cope with inflation that has reached its current 11
percent from 6 percent two years ago. He also must unclog chronic
supply bottlenecks and get rid of waste in government offices and
state factories.
   But any dramatic initiatives to do all those things would need
the approval of fellow members of the Politburo Standing Committee,
including Zhao, his predecessor.
   Zhao had a mandate for change when he became premier in 1980 and
many of his policies remain in force.
   That leaves Li with the task of trying to implement policies set
by Zhao, who may not look kindly on any changes in them by an
underling.
   When Li took office, it was widely speculated he favored central
planning over Zhao's market-style reforms.
   But Li's comments have given no sign he opposes those reforms.
   But Zhao's reforms have hit snags that Li now must try gingerly
to resolve.
   One is economic incentives, such as bonuses, for workers who
increase productivity. They were liberally distributed and had come
to be automatic. In addition, the bonuses are said to have eaten
into capital investment and helped fuel inflation.
   An Asian diplomat quoted Chinese sources as saying Li recently
refused to approve automatic bonuses, maintaining the incentives
should be more closely linked to production increases.
   That report remains to be confirmed.
   But Li has made city mayors responsible for decontrolling
state-subsidized food prices.
   And in a profile of Li's first 130 days in office, the official
weekly magazine Liaowang (Outlook) credited him with playing a
major role in working out a plan to streamline and reorganize the
government bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Ice Cream Entrepreneur Claims 751 Flavors, Including `Sex'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN M. ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ice cream entrepreneur Charles
Sandford didn't believe vanilla and chocolate were enough to draw
in customers, so he added such flavors as fire, flying fish _ and
sex.
   ``Sex is the most exotic,'' the 37-year-old Sandford said. Asked
what's in it, he replies: ``Large, ripe, juicy Barbados cherries
that simmer in crystal-clear champagne until they pop.''
   Sandford's recipe for the flying fish flavor includes fish mash
and smooth peanut butter, as well as milk, eggs and butter. The
flying fish is the national symbol of Barbados, a former British
colony.
   ``I just invented a new flavor, to commemorate the island's 21st
anniversary of independence,'' Sandford said. The concoction
includes 21 different kinds of fruit and is called, appropriately
enough, ``The 21.'' It tastes like a very rich punch.
   Sandford grew up in New York City, where he studied to be a
clothes designer. He ran his own small store until his
Barbados-born wife, Judy, suggested eight years ago that an ice
cream shop in her prosperous and hot Caribbean island might be more
fun and profitable.
   Sandford sold his business in New York and went to Milan, where
he served an apprenticeship at Fragole Fabri, one of Italy's
biggest ice cream factories.
   ``I learned the basics, just enough to make vanilla ice cream,''
he said. ``After the first six months, I knew how to make ice
cream, but I had to learn to improve it and then to master it.''
   Today, he said, ``I am the king.''
   Sandford makes 18 flavors fresh each day. He claims he has
created 751 in all, and is seeking an entry in the Guinness Book of
Records.
   ``Every single recipe is different,'' he said. ``I do not take a
vanilla base ... and simpl change the name as I add different
ingredients.''
   Sandford also meets special requests.
   On Wednesdays, he prepares ice cream for diabetics, using
artificial sweeteners instead of sugar.
   For vegetarians, Sandford makes carrot and zucchini ice cream.
Creamy avocado also is popular.
   Not every flavor is a bestseller.
   ``Tomato did not do too well,'' he said. ``Too acidic.''
   Some flavors contain promotional gimmicks. The main ingredient
in ``money'' ice cream is a tightly-rolled Barbados dollar wrapped
in plastic.
   Sandford did not set out to become a one-man Baskin Robbins or
Howard Johnson's when he opened Gelato five years ago in a chic
mall in suburban St. Michael, one mile outside Bridgetown.
   But shipping delays, high costs and import duties convinced him
he could not rely on importing the ``starters,'' or basic flavors,
from the United States.
   ``I first started experimenting with local fruits,'' he said.
Now, his favorite sherbets are made with mangoes, watermelons and
passion fruit.
   Sandford won't say what goes into his ``fire'' ice cream, which
tastes like hot cinnamon candies.
   But he guarantees, ``This will burn your palate.''

<HEAD>New Survival Book has Tips on How to get Though a Hijacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KATZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not only does it offer tips on how to live on
seawater or finding your way out of a jungle, Martyn Forrester's
new survival manual has advice on how to get through a hijacking.
   Martyn Forrester claims his ``Survival Skills Handbook''
includes the first ``how-to'' guide for hijack hostages.
   ``The book is about survival in any situation ... whether your
plane has crashed or whether you're in a situation where you are
trapped, you're a hostage,'' he said in an interview.
   ``The main premise of the book is that you'll survive if you
think you can. No situation shows that better than the hostage
situation.''
   Most of Forrester's suggestions involve coping mentally with
being held hostage.
   Captives should ``keep busy with mental activity and avoid
depression,'' he writes. ``Always remember that the captors can
control your body, but they cannot control your mind.''
   Hostages should try to establish a rapport with their
kidnappers, he advises, but adds that ``logic is not valid in this
sort of situation: relate on an emotional level.''
   Communicating with a nervous, trigger-happy hijacker can be
risky, he says, but ``it's something that's worth trying if you
physically can.''
   The book also suggests precautions for international travelers
worried about hijackers: don't wear military-style clothing or
carry military identification papers.
   ``You'd be surprised at the number of people who get on
airplanes in camouflage military jackets and dog tags around their
necks,'' Forrester said.
   The book also recommends that air passengers carry family
photographs in their passports or wallets.
   ``They will make you appear a family person with dependents, and
a less likely candidate, it is hoped, for execution.''
   Forrester said the book's section on hostages and hijackings
contains ``tried and tested'' ideas, as well as ``theoretical
models of people who are dealing in this field, ... clinical
psychologists who are actually involved in hostage situations.''
   With hijackers becoming more sophisticated, he said, potential
victims need to be better prepared.
   In a hijacking, he said, ``what you can do to physically help
yourself is incredibly limited. But what you can do to keep
yourself sane is entirely up to you. You either help yourself or
you don't.''
   Forrester, 35, says he gained his expertise while undergoing
military training courses in Britain.
   He has never been involved in a hijacking, and admits his
expertise is more on the techniques, but an expert on terrorism who
reviewed Forrester's suggestions agrees that publishing them is a
good idea.
   Bernard Adamczewski of the London-based Institute for the Study
of Terrorism found the advice for hostages sensible ``provided you
can take it in.''
   ``Most of such advice is really common sense,'' he said in an
interview, ``and some people can't be calm in such circumstances.''
   While mental preparation is important, Adamczewski said, the
book's best advice is that international airline passengers should
carry as little identification with them as possible.
   ``The Survival Skills Handbook'' is available in Britain and
other English-speaking countries, and Forrester hopes to publish it
in the United States soon.
   He maintained that with his advice, travelers will at least be
able to find comfort in the fact that they have done something to
protect themselves.
   ``They can actually think: `Right, I'm scared about the journey.
I can take those labels off my suitcase. I can make sure I've got a
nice picture of my wife and kids, or husband, in my wallet. So at
least if I am stuck in that situation, I've done what I can,''' he
said.

<HEAD>Pets and Summer: Special Attention Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dogs and cats have become major parts of
millions of American families, and when summer brings hot weather
and vacation travel, pets need some special attention.
   Summer means added hazards for pets, from heatstroke to
heartworms. But, with help, pets can cope. They can even go along
on most vacation trips, according to pet care experts.
   Probably the biggest hazard faced by pets in the summer is
overheating, particularly if left in an automobile, even for a
brief period.
   ``On a warm day, the temperature in a parked car can reach 160
degrees in a matter of minutes, even with partially opened
windows,'' warns the Humane Society of the United States. ``With
only hot air to breathe, your pet can quickly suffer brain damage
or die from heatstroke.''
   The simple answer is don't leave the pet alone in a parked car.
Leave them home when on a trip to the store or other errand.
   If dogs are left outdoors, make sure they have shade available
and fresh water _ check the yard at all times of the day, to be
sure shade is always available.
   Cats, says the Humane Sociaty, should be kept indoors all year _
it keeps them from overheating, from getting run over by cars and
from other hazards.
   Joggers and beach fans also need to remember that what's fun for
them may be dangerous for a dog.
   Canines will try and keep up with a jogging master, and an
out-of-shape pooch can injure itself by pushing beyond its limits.
And dogs were simply not built for the beach, where there is little
shade and they can overheat, burn the pads of their feet and be
attacked by sand fleas.
   As humidity goes up, dog heat tolerance goes down, and dogs
don't sweat to relieve the heat the way humans do, according to
animal care specialists at the Department of Agriculture.
   Still, traveling with a pet can be fun, especially if you get
them checked in advance by a veterinarian and provide a good travel
carrier.
   Bring along familier food, stop frequently to give them water
and let them exercise, and make sure to have two collars on the dog
_ with identification on both _ in case they slip out of the one
with the leash attached.
   Many hotels and motels accept pets, and airlines will make
special arrangements for them.
   The American Automobile Association and Alpo Petfoods have put
together a handy pamphlet on traveling with pets, called ``Pets on
the Go.'' It discusses health and safety in traveling, what to take
along, and many other considerations.
   Copies are available free at local AAA offices or by sending a
stamped, self-addressed long envelope to Pets on the Go, AAA Public
Affairs, 8111 Gatehouse Road, Falls Church, Va., 22047.
   One added thought about vacations: The Humane Society notes that
some people will adopt a stray animal while on vacation, then leave
it behind when they return home.
   Lonely, scared and hungry, these ``leftovers'' will wander in
search of their owners until killed by a passing car, disease or
starvation, the Humane Society warns. People who can no longer care
for an animal should at least take it to the nearest animal shelter.
   As to summer's more routine problems, here are some thoughts
from the federal Food and Drug Administration:
   _Heartworms are a major danger in summer and can cause death to
a dog. They are transmitted by mosquitoes and are most common in
warm areas, but are spreading. Have dogs checked by a vet and then
begin use of preventive medication.
   _Fleas and ticks can cause major discomfort and may carry
disease. Special soaps, collars, powders and sprays can help, but
be sure to get the brand labeled for your pet _ don't use dog
sprays on a cat, for example. Serious cases may require veterinary
care.
   _Regular grooming is important for dogs, to find ticks and brush
out tangles and mats from the coat. It's not a good idea to shave
long-haired dogs, though, since the coat protects them from sunburn
and for some breeds it insulates them from the heat.

   By almost any definition the annual inflation
rate is under 5 percent and unlikely to move much higher than that
in the near future.
   But, as you probably have suspected, that doesn't mean your
personal rate can't rise faster than that. If you are inclined
toward so-called finer things, your inflation rate could be close
to double-digit.
   But in all probabilility, the higher your personal inflation
rate the more you can do about it, most directly by dropping your
sights to alternative purchases that cost less and maybe serve as
well or better.
   Evidence of this comes in the National Financial Planning Index,
produced by the 24,000-member International Association for
Financial Planning. This year it is 9 percent higher than 1987 for
a very atypical basket of goods.
   The essentials:
   A $75,000 annual income, a one-child family, an upscale home,
financing for a retirement plan, saving for a four-year private
college education, payments for a new car, a one-week vacation, a
$500,000 life insurance policy.
   After setting money aside for paying taxes, the association
informs us, this family is likely to have only 25 percent left for
food, medicine, monthly bills and clothing.
   But is the family pressed? Or is it pressed only because of its
conception of what is important in life?
   The assumptions:
   _A 7 percent, 25-year mortgage on a $258,098 home in an affluent
suburb.
   _Financing, over a 25-year period, of a retirement plan to yield
$169,000 a year.
   _Saving over a 12-year period to finance a four-year, private
college education for the one youngster.
   _Financing a $16,162 car _ Volvo, Saab, Chrysler LeBaron _ over
a four-year period.
   _Saving for a one-week family vacation in the Caribbean to cost
$2,334 (not including food and personal expenses).
   _Annual cost of a $500,000 life insurance policy.
   _State, federal and social security taxes.
   All this, according to those folks dedicated to helping you make
ends meet, will cost $55,896, or 74.6 percent of gross household
income, a 9 percent jump over similar costs in 1987.
   In offering this National Financial Planning Index, the
association includes an unusual caveat: ``This family needs to
readjust spending goals.''
   Why issue such an index, especially in view of the statement by
Larry Carroll, the association's chairman, that ``we are not
telling people they should be spending three-quarters of their
income on all of these items.''
   Rather, he continued, ``We hope people will look at this index,
examine their own financial situation, set some realistic goals and
objectives for themselves and then adjust their present budgets as
necessary.''
   Realism isn't difficult to apply to the association hypothesis.
   Why insist on an upscale home in an affluent suburb? Why assume
it will not rise in value and thus afford the occupants a big gain
toward their retirement fund?
   Why look forward to retirement with a plan that relies partially
on the assumption that savings will earn 7 percent income while
inflation amounts to 5 percent, for a net of 2 percent?
   Why would anyone save $6,648 a year for college tuition at a 7
percent rate while inflation also roared along at 7 percent _
which, in this instance, the index assumes?
   Who needs an annual vacation in the Caribbean?
   Who needs an upscale automobile?

<HEAD>Bridging the Gap: Pepsi, Jeans Show U.S. Influence on Soviet
Society</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Images of Michael Jackson dancing to rock music in
a Pepsi commercial flicker across the Soviet television screen, and
Levi's jeans hug the hips of young Russians in a crowded subway car.
   Amerika, as the Soviets call it, has arrived.
   ``Far behind the Iron Curtain, we were able to develop a
pro-Western mentality, and what, tell me, could be more Western
than America?'' emigre author Vasily Aksyonov wrote about his youth
in the Soviet Union of the 1950s.
   Even the Cyrillic alphabet hasn't prevented what the Russians
call Amerikanizatsia. ``Jeansi,'' ``stop,'' ``break dance,'' ``OK''
and one of the latest signs of the times _ ``stress'' _ are now
part of the Russian lexicon.
   Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev has
encouraged his people to learn more about America. To demonstrate
his sincerity, he has allowed more travel to the United States,
ended the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts and removed
barriers to joint business deals.
   In April, a record 1,200 Soviets, most of them Jews, were
allowed to visit relatives in the United States. An additional
1,000 Soviets traveled there on official business. Before
Gorbachev, only a handful of Soviets visited the United States
monthly.
   The 1985 Geneva summit gave an official stamp of approval to
cultural agreements and ``people-to-people'' exchanges. Under the
agreements, Soviet and American lawyers, doctors, students,
musicians, scientists and teachers have visited each other.
   In some instances, the exchanges reflect a Soviet desire for
American help in tackling social problems such as alcoholism and
drug addiction, problems the government previously denied existed.
   At the grass-roots level, Soviets need little encouragement to
talk about things American.
   When introduced to an American, many Soviets immediately start
with the questions, on everything from war and peace to the
availability of hamburgers.
   A taxi driver's reaction when a passenger introduced himself as
an American was to run down the American authors she loved _ Ernest
Hemingway, Mark Twain, Ray Bradbury. Collections of these authors
in translation occupy prominent places on the bookshelves in some
Soviet apartments. More contemporary American authors are lesser
known because their works still aren't available in the Soviet
Union.
   Levi's jeans are required attire in certain circles. And some of
those who manage to get an American candy bar, soft drink or pack
of cigarettes proudly display the empty packaging in their living
rooms.
   Many Soviets are turning to videotapes for a glimpse of America.
Tapes of movies such as ``Police Academy'' and ``Rambo,'' dubbed in
Russian, are passed among friends in a thriving black market where
blank cassettes cost at least 50 rubles ($80), or one quarter of an
average monthly salary.
   The black market also feeds on young Soviets' thirst for
American rock music. Records of Madonna and Michael Jackson fetch
exorbitant sums. Jackson's music videos have appeared on Soviet
television, and his Pepsi commercials hit the airwaves in mid-May
during broadcast of a five-part series on the United States.
   Officially sponsored concerts by American musicians such as
Billy Joel, Dave Brubeck and the Doobie Brothers have become major
happenings.
   At the same time, some Soviet rock stars are traveling to the
United States. Boris Grebenshchikov, the hippy-like leader of the
Leningrad rock band Aquarium, is scheduled to record an album in
the United States this summer.
   The end of Soviet jamming of Voice of America broadcasts in May
1987 opened a new source of information about life in the United
States.
   Satellite television discussions with American studio audiences
also have given Soviets a chance to learn first-hand about life in
the United States. Soviet television's widely watched evening news
program ``Vremya'' has shown features on child care, automobiles
and sports in America, and in mid-May Soviet television broadcast a
series moderated by former U.S. resident Vladimir Posner.
   But even though Soviet media coverage about the United States
has become more balanced under Gorbachev, reports about crime,
unemployment, racism and the poor are still common.
   In politics, Americans and Soviets still have sharp differences.
But for many of the Soviets who viewed Reagan as a warmonger a few
years ago the rhetoric has eased since he signed an agreement with
Gorbachev last December to eliminate all medium-range nuclear
missiles.
   ``We have no propaganda of hatred toward Americans, no
disrespect of Americans,'' Gorbachev told a group of U.S. teachers
of Russian who met with him at the Kremlin last August. ``One
cannot find them here, either in politics or in teaching.''

   Both parties are about set on their presidential
nominees. With the season of preliminary winnowing nearly over,
it's worth recapturing its gaudier moments and amazing contretemps.
The primary campaigns may not have produced startling breakthroughs
in political ground but, as the following report shows, they rank
high in the long tradition of politics as entertainment.

   Once there were 14 candidates for president.
Now there are three.
   Has the wheat been separated from the chaff? Has it been
survival of the fittest or survival of the hardiest, richest,
cleverest, slickest?
   Best or not, this is what's left after the strangest primary
season in memory, a mad marathon in which history was shaped by
philandering and plagiarism, pratfalls and yawns.
   Now, finally, the pack has dwindled down to a tidy few after 66
primaries and 42 precinct caucuses across the land and in all the
island territories and clusters of expatriates abroad. About 30
million people have voted, at least $170 million has been spent, 42
debates have been debated, umptyfour-hundred speeches have floated
up to the poor ozone in clouds of charge and countercharge on the
order of ``so's your old man.'' The last pockets of insomniac
resistance have fallen.
   It is a campaign that has gone from the Marx Brothers to ``Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner,'' a movie about white liberals who suddenly
learn their daughter is dating a black man. In February, people
were asking what does Jesse Jackson really want, a cabinet job? In
March, they were beginning to wonder whom President Jackson would
put in his cabinet. By June, they were asking what Mr. Jackson
would settle for outside the Oval Office.
   Candidates moved ahead, candidates fell behind, definitions
twisted, rationalizations multiplied. The media decreed that a man
loses if he does not win by enough.
   Even winning big could be suspect. Michael Dukakis won big in
Wisconsin. But Hark! An exit poll then showed that fewer of his
supporters voted for him ``with enthusiasm'' than did the voters
for Jackson and Albert Gore. Meaningful? Ominous?
   There was something for everybody. If you ran second, it was
because the winner outspent you. If you ran third, it was because
he distorted your record. If you ran fourth, you emphasized that
you trounced the man who ran fifth. If you ran fifth, you exulted
in the fact that you did better than last week. If you ran last,
you dug down deep and claimed you were doing better than expected.
Sooner or later they all beat ``expected.''
   Something for everybody. In 1936, Alf Landon was buried by
Franklin Roosevelt in the greatest (until then) landslide in
history. Some years later, Landon and his wife ran into Norman
Thomas, the perennial Socialist candidate. Landon said, ``Dear, I'd
like you to meet the man I licked in 1936.''
   The election of 1988 already owns a unique place in history on
several counts, we are told by Paul F. Boller Jr., author of
``Presidential Campaigns.''
   No black candidate became a major factor in a presidential
election before. No man was a candidate twice in the same campaign.
No previous race had two preachers running. No candidate ever quit
the race before because of infidelity or plagiarism. Though
presidential candidates from Tom Jefferson to Jack Kennedy have
been whispered about before, none lost an election because of
bedroom sport.
   But fate failed Gary Hart even in the tiny detail. For example,
the boat he and the young model shared in the Caribbean.
   Couldn't it have been named something romantic but impersonal
like Windsong or North Star, or something personal but innocent
like Bonus Baby or Dad's Day Off, or something presidential like
Destiny or Yankee Leader, but why, by what mystical movement of the
spheres, did they reach so far down the scale of human aspiration
to call it _ months later, one still cringes _ to call it Monkey
Business?
   In their zeal, reformers have managed to steer the nominating
process out of the smoke-filled rooms and into the gas-filled
frenzy of more primaries and more candidates. The traffic is
particularly heavy when the incumbent is not running and the heir
apparent is less than apparent.
   Hart was clearly the front-running Democrat until he quit. Then
speculation and attention fastened on three non-candidates, Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York and Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and
Sam Nunn of Georgia. The actual candidates had trouble getting
their names in the papers until someone raised the shades on Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware. There, suddenly, was a candidate for
president of the United States giving voice to words, images and
reflections that belonged to the head of the British Labor Party.
   Caught, Biden confessed his ``mistakes'' and withdrew. The urge
to confess, it seemed, was in the air.
   Dukakis' campaign manager confessed he was the one who blew the
whistle on Biden, which he figured was, after all, his job. Dukakis
confessed how sorry he was and his campaign manager resigned in the
spreading mea culpa. Hart confessed to infidelity. Pat Robertson,
campaigning on a call for pre-marital restraint, was caught with
his marriage license showing, and confessed that, yes, it was dated
only 10 weeks before his son's birth certificate.
   Across the political landscape, Judge Douglas Ginsburg tripped
on his way to the Supreme Court when he confessed he had once
smoked marijuana. So did I, said Gore. Me, too, said Bruce Babbitt.
I have sinned, wept Jimmy Swaggart, who wasn't even a candidate.
   It would be difficult to choose among the campaign's most
dramatic moments. For example:
   High noon in the Senate of the United States.
   Eyes cold with anger, the minority leader strode around the well
of the chamber to the presiding officer's desk, where sat the vice
president of the United States.
   ``What kind of candidate would put out a statement attacking
another candidate and his wife without reading it?'' Robert Dole
snapped.
   ``Your people called me a `cornered lap dog,''' said George Bush.
   ``I didn't call you a lap dog,'' said Robert Dole.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Robert Dole.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton might've
settled it at 50 paces. Dole and Bush returned to the campaign.
   High noon on the Evening News.
   Dan Rather wanted to talk about Iran-Contra. George Bush wanted
to talk about education and the deficit. Rather said he wanted to
set the record straight. Bush said Rather had impugned his
integrity. Rather said he didn't want to be argumentative, but.
Bush said it was unfair to judge his whole record by Iran and (as
if bringing up a family scandal) ``how would you like it if I
judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the
set?'' Rather said it was more important to discuss Bush's
qualifications for president than (as if delicately paraphrasing a
profanity) ``what you just referred to.''
   The temperature rose, the pace quickened and soon both were
talking at once and, mercifully, neither could be heard.
   In their traveling debates, the candidates pelted each other,
relentlessly, with marshmallows while audiences coast to coast
wondered if the cavalry would never come. Democrat or Republican,
the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the front-runner
since he had the most votes and some might drop loose. Issues were
as hard to find as passion.
   Almost invariably, nobody picked on Jackson or the reincarnated
Hart because one man's votes were unbudgeable and the other's
non-existent. Jackson, once the voice of protest in the land, took
on the role of establishment harmonizer and gently chided the
others when they lost their heads and became adversarial.
   Jackson, of course, couldn't do anything about Dole. On national
TV one night, Dole accused Bush of ``lying'' about his record, and
across the land political behaviorists tsked and said wasn't that
shocking?
   Through the last century, calling presidential candidates liar
was a relatively polite form of discourse. They were also called
traitor, lecher, murderer, thief, drunkard, atheist, pickpocket,
syphilitic, gorilla.
   In the campaign of 1800, John Adams' Federalists described
Thomas Jefferson as a ``mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of
a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father ...
raised wholly on hoecake made of coarse-ground Southern corn, bacon
and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog.''
   Jefferson's Republicans lashed back by spreading a story that
President Adams was plotting to marry off one of his sons to a
daughter of King George III to begin an American dynasty and revive
royal links with Britain.
   In the politesse of the 1988 primary campaign, candidates
grappled more with their image than with each other. Media
consultants and other unfrocked shrinks along the way agreed that
Dole, for example, had to fight a mean streak; Bush, a wimp streak.
   Other perceived streaks to be resisted were Dukakis,
mechanistic; Alexander Haig, militaristic; Pierre Samuel du Pont
IV, rich; Simon, dull; Robertson, ``funny facts.''
   They tried various disguises. Dole smiled more. Bush thrashed
Rather. Dukakis danced to bouzouki music. Simon flipped pancakes.
Haig cozied a baby pig. Du Pont said call me Pete.
   Hart and Biden brought the Democrats odd headlines. Pat
Robertson took care of the Republicans.
   In his autobiography, Robertson wrote that God had told him a
minister should not run for public office. Then he announced he
might run for president. Then his book was re-issued, with God's
injunction excised. Then he announced that God was now telling him
to run. No other candidate claimed that endorsement.
   In New Hampshire, Robertson let it be known that the Russians
still had nuclear missiles in Cuba. Not true, said the White House,
but its source was a satellite only 2,000 miles up. Did Robertson
have word from higher authority?
   In Atlanta, Robertson said he knew where the American hostages
were held in Lebanon, and in Washington President Reagan wondered
aloud why he hadn't shared that information with the government.
   And then George Bush put on his cowboy boots, Al Gore donned his
down-home smile, Mike Dukakis packed up the old folks, Pat
Robertson dusted off the family album and away they went, to Super
Tuesday, on a frantic steeplechase across 20 states in which the
corn pone of Dixie was mixed with the slick sell of Madison Avenue
and a handshake was replaced by a greeting from outer space.
   No primary day ever before had demanded so much travel. So
candidates flitted around like nervous fleas on a dog having a
nightmare, and the constant motion, the merciless speechifying, the
pounding TV commercials produced a numbing blur. The Washington
Post called it Stupor Tuesday.
   Gone were the leisurely ``coffees'' the candidates had with
voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Now they hopped from airport to
airport, saw no voters, talked fast for local TV and were gone
again. Or they holed up in a hotel room and took questions from TV
stations hundreds of miles away and answered via a satellite 22,300
miles above the equator.
   Back on earth and lacking only a magnolia in his ear, Pat
Robertson strode the red clay hills of South Carolina proclaiming,
``I'm the only candidate who was born at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital. I'm the only one who went to college where Robert E. Lee
was president.''
   And to the condos of south Florida they came, to the homes and
the pools of senior citizens who take their franchise seriously.
Richard Gephardt appeared in their living rooms with a glowing TV
benediction from a local hero, Rep. Claude Pepper, 87. Dukakis
showed up with former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., 75, who
spoke highly of Dukakis' position on Social Security and Medicare.
   Gephardt sent his 80-year-old mother to the condos in person.
Dukakis rallied. He sent his 84-year-old mother and his 79-year-old
father-in-law.
   And the crocuses came and they campaigned in Illinois and
Connecticut and the forsythia came and they campaigned in Wisconsin
and New York and the dogwood came and they campaigned in
Pennsylvania and Ohio and the azaleas came and they campaigned in
New Jersey and California and, each in turn, like the petals of a
flower whose time had come, they fell gently to earth, all but
three.

   To many Sicilians, going after the Mafia is
tantamount to trying to suppress the weather. Italian authorities
have arrested 4,100 suspected Mafiosi since 1982. Hundreds were
convicted in ``maxi-trials'' and sent to prison. But, in Sicily the
Mafia is also known as ``la piovra,'' the octopus, because it
regenerates severed tentacles.

<TEXT>
   The Sicilian Mafia, far from beaten by
mass arrests, is diversifying its drug operations and reverting to
lucrative extortion and kidnapping, Italian officials say.
   Pressure on the Mafia has cut its share of the American heroin
market from one-third down to barely 10 percent, U.S. officials
say, but sales have been channeled instead to Western Europe.
   Mafia wholesalers are pushing cocaine into new European markets.
They exchange heroin directly for Colombian cocaine, eliminating
the cash transfers that make them vulnerable.
   A defector has implicated two recent cabinet ministers, echoing
others' statements that senior political figures protect the Mafia,
but police say they have no proof to move against politicians.
   ``Trials alone are not enough,'' said Giusto Sciacchitano, a
senior prosecutor, interviewed in the concrete bunker where a team
of magistrates piece together evidence for continuing
``maxi-trials.''
   Under new laws, Italian authorities have seized $200 million in
suspect earnings since 1982. In December, 338 Mafiosi were given
2,665 years of sentences after the first maxi-trial.
   In April, a joint U.S.-Italian operation disrupted the Pizza
Connection, which markets Mafia heroin in America. Police arrested
Emanuele Adamita, a fugitive Sicilian drug lord, and 101 others.
   But public fear, official corruption, lack of evidence, foreign
refuges and Italy's legal system were all obstacles, Sciacchitano
said. ``The Mafia is very hard to beat. Very hard.''
   After the maxi-trial verdicts were delivered, hit men on a
motorscooter murdered Giuseppe Insalaco, a former Palermo mayor who
fought corruption, as he sat at the wheel of his car in rush-hour
traffic.
   In Italy, prosecutors cannot plea bargain, nor can police
infiltrate. The law requires that all crimes be punished, even when
committed by undercover officers or state's witnesses as part of an
investigation.
   Italy is ill-equipped to protect informers and their families
from Mafia vengeance. Tommaso Buscetta, the Mafia boss-informer
behind the first maxi-trials, took refuge in the United States.
   Buscetta helped convict Vito Ciancimino, ex-mayor of Palermo,
but Sciacchitano said politicians were difficult to put on trial. A
parliamentary committee linked Ciancimino to the Mafia in 1976.
   ``The Mafia has always been at the edges of power,'' said
Attilio Bolzoni, a journalist who was arrested recently after
reporting on an informer's confession that named two ministers. He
was held six days, then released.
   U.S. authorities say privately that although Italy has scored
important victories, little will change if public officials close
to the Mafia were not rooted out.
   Apart from outright graft, diplomats say, some politicians court
the vital Sicilian vote by going easy on the issue.
   Italian authorities are divided on how far the Mafia reaches
into the state. Giuseppe Grassi, director of the Anti-Crime
Department of Italy's national police force, said:
   ``We have no evidence. Of course, there is some official
corruption. That is normal. But politicians belonging to the Mafia,
I don't think so.''
   Grassi contends that with uncounted billions of dollars in drug
revenue, with sanctuaries provided by Latin American governments,
the Mafia no longer needs political protection.
   Authorities have arrested 4,100 suspected Mafiosi since 1982, he
said. ``But they can replace them overnight in Sicily, with all its
unemployment and poverty,'' he added.
   For many Sicilians, going after the Mafia is tantamount to
trying to suppress the weather.
   ``Hah,'' snorted an entrepreneur named Napoli when asked if the
Mafia had been weakened. He drove his questioner by the leafy
piazza where Joe Petrosino, a New York detective, was murdered in
1902.
   Petrosino, who was investigating the Mafia, was shot with a
sawed-off shotgun known as a lupara. Modern versions, submachine
guns, more recently killed an average of one person a day in
Palermo.
   Italian and U.S. authorities agreed that Mafia families had made
a strategic retreat to regroup, not only reorganizing their drug
operations but also concentrating more on extortion and ransom.
   Such venerable dons as Michele Greco and Luciano Liggio,
convicted in the maxi-trial, live lavishly in prison, with servants
bringing them champagne meals from Palermo's finest restaurants.
   ``These guys can run a drug operation from inside prison just as
well as they can outside,'' a U.S. drug enforcement officer
observed.

   Salvatore Riina and Bernardo Provenzano of the dominant Corleone
family are still loose. Besides, police say, the Mafia is known as
``la piovra,'' the octopus, because it regenerates severed
tentacles.
   By ``the Mafia,'' Italians mean about 30 Sicilian ``families,''
linked in crime not blood, whose worldwide income makes up perhaps
1-2 percent of Italy's gross national product.
   Thousands of men sworn to silence by the code of ``omerta''
supervise couriers, bag men, informers and enforcers. Grassi
estimates as many as 50,000 people might be involved in Mafia
operations.
   Sicilian patriarchs hold tight sway over family branches in the
United States and Latin America, rarely trusting home-grown mobs
that often go under the generic label of Mafia.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officers discovered that heroin
networks were compartmentalized so that couriers knew only their
immediate controller. Families made sure that key people do not
talk.
   ``We found that every time we got up to a certain level, we had
a homicide on our hands,'' one senior agent said.
   The drug traffic brought deep changes to the Mafia, which had
evolved slowly from its roots in feudal Sicily where it once
defended rural landowners.
   The Mafia has specialized in construction but kept a hammerlock
on Sicily's economy. Shopkeepers pay a ``pizzo,'' a premium against
petty criminals or untoward accidents. Public services must contend
with Mafia for labor and services.
   Palermo is the last major European city to dig itself out from
World War II; its old port is pocked with crumbling buildings and
gaping empty spaces.
   Mayor Leoluca Orlando, staunchly anti-Mafia, fears contracts
awarded to local companies will enrich criminals. In the past,
reconstruction was stalled because so much money was stolen.
   In the city of Catania, an American-trained doctor said, ``They
are in everything. They decide who is hired and they take a cut of
what is purchased.''
   One public hospital spent enormous sums for spoiled food from a
Mafia-run catering service after its kitchen was destroyed
mysteriously, he said.
   In the 1970s, after the French Connection was severed in
Marseille, the Sicilian Mafia hired Lebanese chemists and took over
the business. Vast new revenues made the Mafia a major
multinational.
   Sleek, ruthlessly ambitious young men began replacing folkloric
dons in baggy pants. The title ``Honorable Society'' lost meaning
for Sicilians who once condoned it.
   By some estimates, their drug turnover reached $10 billion a
year at its peak. In the late 1970s, Mafia killers began striking
back at the state.
   In 1982, Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, a popular police general
who had fought the Red Brigades, was sent to Palermo to quell the
Mafia. He and his wife were murdered in a spray of bullets.
   Hours earlier, Dalla Chiesa had complained to a diplomat that
Rome had not delivered promised support. At the funeral, his
daughter Rita, a television journalist in Rome, returned flowers to
officials she suspected were implicated.
   ``I don't know if the Mafia is weaker now, but people are no
longer afraid to say its name,'' she said in a recent interview.
   In 1982, the La Torre Law, named after a murdered legislator,
made Mafia membership illegal and allowed property seizures. Since
then, a growing ``anti-Mafia'' is speaking out.
   Many young Sicilians say they are tired of seeing their province
paralyzed by fear and stagnation.
   Rita Costa, widow of a crusading magistrate murdered in 1980,
has since become a regional legislator dedicated to the anti-Mafia.
   ``We can fight them only by mobilizing people, by teaching
children about the dangers they face,'' she said. ``We must say no
to the Mafia.''
   Even within the Mafia, some of the Old Guard draw the line at
killing wives and using women to smuggle drugs. Buscetta said the
breaching of old codes was a reason he turned against the Mafia.
   In the anteroom outside Orlando's office, supplicants wait on
dark wood benches for solutions to their problems. City officials
know that if they do not respond, the Mafia might.
   Judge Giovanni Falcone, the flamboyant head magistrate, lives
behind a 24-hour guard of heavy arms, vault locks and television
cameras, with varying support from Rome.
   He canceled scheduled anti-Mafia courses at a local university
when authorities decided it was just too dangerous. In some ways,
Falcone is more a prisoner than the men he has locked up.
   Luciano Liggio, in a well-appointed cell, took up painting
nature scenes. His first show sold out, and he put the earnings
toward a kidney clinic for the grateful citizens of Corleone.

<DATELINE>CORLEONE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When warm weather covers Sicily's ancient
hills in flowers, bus loads of Americans converge on Corleone
seeking ``The Godfather.'' They have no more success than Italian
police.
   As it turns out, the Corleone family now dominates the Sicilian
Mafia, a loose confederation of maybe 30 groups, but Don Vito
Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in the movie) does not come from
this little agricultural town.
   Most American branches of the Sicilian Mafia emigrated from
Agrigento, an ancient port now choked with new construction from
illegal money sent home.
   Corleone is so poor that its 300-year-old town hall, damaged 20
years ago in an earthquake, is in danger of collapse. There is
plenty of Mafia money, but it is seldom flaunted.
   Among most of the 11,100 inhabitants of Corleone and its
surrounding fields, the word ``Mafia'' produces a nervous chuckle
or a silent stare.
   No, they will tell you, they do not know if patriarchs Salvatore
Riina and Bernardo Provenzano are hiding in the well-charted hills.
   At town hall, however, Vice Mayor Cosmo Di Carlo rejects the
idea that his town is especially touched by the Sicily-wide
phenomenon.
   ``We have a long anti-Mafia tradition,'' he said, producing a
folder that mentioned a crusading mayor murdered in 1918. When his
visitor noted it did not specify who killed him, Di Carlo replied,
``Sir, this is a tourist brochure.''
   Deserved or not, Corleone has gotten used to the nickname some
Italians have given it: Tombstone.
   ``We had a Japanese TV crew here,'' Di Carlo said. ``I explained
carefully how all this Godfather business was Hollywood fantasy.
When I finished, they said, `Yes, we understand, now show us the
Godfather's house.'''

   As prime fish habitats become more and more
vital to the tourist industry and state economies, so has
government's role in stocking streams and lakes. Hard-core fly
fishermen disdain hatchery-raised trout, but defenders say that
without extensive stocking, thousands of anglers would never catch
a fish at all. This is the second of three articles.

   It was a fisherman's fantasy come true:
swimming together in an undulating black wave were 30,000 trout.
   There was, however, a problem for the eager angler. Each of the
creatures darting around in the concrete tank's 46.5-degree water
was less than half an inch long.
   At the Daniel Hatchery, one of 12 run by Wyoming's Game and Fish
Department, three employees raise nearly 2 million fish every year.
The dozen state hatcheries ``planted'' 32 million fish in Wyoming
waters in 1987. Nearly all were trout.
   They are kept in temperature-controlled indoor and outdoor
tanks, depending on their size, and are fed a high protein ``trout
chow'' composed of fish meal, liver and grain. A pathologist
regularly checks them for viral diseases and parasites.
   State biologists continually survey lake and stream fish
populations and place orders for varieties according to need.
   The Daniel Hatchery raises seven kinds of trout as well as
Arctic grayling and Kokanee salmon. The fish range from fry less
than an inch long, through fingerlings, up to catchables 8 inches
and larger. There are even lunkers, 3-pounders that produce
spawning eggs, which are released into streams as 6-year-olds when
their egg quality declines.
   Hatchery fish production is at an all-time high in many states,
although budget cutbacks in the Reagan administration have affected
some government programs.
   ``The demand for fish is increasing every year and we're
producing the maximum here that we can,'' said Daniel manager Dick
Cheeney.
   That's because all over America right now fishermen are
untangling lines, buying licenses and plunging with gusto into
another season of hope.
   A recent Gallup poll ranked fishing as the nation's second most
popular outdoor sport, just behind swimming and ahead of bicycling.
   The U.S. Department of the Interior found in a 1986 survey that
58.5 million citizens call themselves fishermen. In 1962 only 13
million people fished for fun.
   In proclaiming June 6-12 National Fishing Week, President Reagan
said, ``Fishing greatly aids our economy, it is a source of
healthful food, promotes respect for sound conservation and for the
bounty and wonder of our natural resources, and introduces millions
of people to the benefits of outdoor recreation.''
   The Sports Fishing Institute, founded by tackle manufacturers in
1949, estimates Americans spend $28.2 billion a year on the hobby.
About 750,000 jobs either directly or peripherally depend on it.
   Industry experts agree fly fishing is especially popular among
Baby Boomers who have more money and time to commune with nature.
   ``It's an ethical sport that's caught the imagination of younger
people,'' said Bob Herbst, executive director of Trout Unlimited, a
55,000-member organization devoted to enjoying and improving
cold-water fisheries.
   Herbst said the sport seemed to ``attract the hard-driving young
executives because it involves a little intellect, it's more than
just dangling a worm in a body of water.''
   Tom Rosenbauer, editor of the Orvis News, a newsletter published
by America's oldest mail-order company, goes fly-fishing on his
lunch hour.
   ``The people here in the office fish before work and after
work,'' said Rosenbauer, who is based at Orvis' headquarters in
Manchester, Vt.
   ``There are three or four little brook trout streams right in
the middle of town that fish very well at noon on a size 14 Yellow
Humpy.''
   He said that in the past 15 years there had been a steady 10
percent to 15 percent growth in Orvis' fly-fishing equipment
business.
   ``Then last year there was a 50 percent-plus jump in our tackle
sales,'' Rosenbauer said. ``Our fly-fishing schools now fill up
with waiting lists. I think the boom everybody's been predicting
for the past decade is here.''
   In the West, fly fishing is a vital and growing part of state
economies heavily dependent on tourism. Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and
Colorado, which have depressed agricultural and natural resource
sectors, compete against each other for the big bucks brought in by
vacationing anglers.
   The growing dependence of tourism dollars on prime fish habitat
has engendered a debate over the merits of stocking blue ribbon
cold-water streams and lakes with hatchery-raised fish.

<HEAD>DANIEL: hatchery-raised fish.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the United States, thousands of miles of water flow through
the 729 million acres of public lands. Each state's water law
varies, but generally the people have access to all of America's
navigable streams, unlike in England where almost all sports waters
are privately owned.
   ``Fishing regulations are still evolving from colonial times,
when we rejected the English ways but created a vacuum,'' said Paul
Schullery, an associate editor of Country Journal in Harrisburg, Pa.
   ``Over the years the laws have become enormously tangled. The
catch and release philosophy only started about 50 years ago. The
hatchery approach is increasingly under fire, especially by fly
fishermen who put a higher aesthetic value on wild trout.''
   Until the Civil War, America's rivers and streams were chock
full of wild fish.
   ``A guy could take home a hundred trout from one day's fishing,
go back and do it again the next day, and nobody noticed,'' said
Schullery. ``After the war there was an explosion in recreation and
travel with expansion of the railroads. The country grew up, and
growing access to the nation's waters began emptying the streams of
fish.
   ``People realized they had to do something about it and the
natural course was to begin stocking them with hatchery supplies.
In a lot of places there would have been no fish left without
hatchery fish, but now it's a big bureaucracy.''
   Hard-core fly fishermen disdain hatchery-raised trout, claiming
that only wild ones are tough fighters with pretty rainbow-colored
scales and have a firm texture and pink tint to their flesh.
Besides, they say, fish raised on hatchery chow taste mushy.
   Defenders counter that without the government's extensive
stocking efforts, thousands of anglers would never experience the
thrill of landing a fish at all.
   Many New England states, as well as New York and Pennsylvania,
have long supported sports fisheries with public money, a financial
commitment that migrated slowly westward with the population.
   Since 1950, federal money also has been earmarked to improve and
maintain fish habitats, upgrade fishing and boating access and
conduct research.
   In 1984, the Wallop-Breaux Fund, named after Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., and Rep. John B. Breaux, D-La., who introduced the
measure in Congress, quadrupled the amount returning to the states.
   The money comes from taxes on tackle, motors, boat fuel and
import duties on sports fishing equipment and pleasure craft.
   This year Washington will give back through state fish and game
departments more than $155 million in user fees to improve hobby
fishing. The funds are distributed on the basis of land and water
area and the number of fishing licenses issued by each state.
   The 1986 Department of the Interior survey indicated 6.4 million
Americans were fly fishermen. John D. Randolph, editor of Fly
Fisherman magazine, estimates 500,000 of those are hard-core
anglers, with another million described as ``serious.'' The rest
are presumed to play at it.
   Trout Unlimited has 450 U.S. chapters and is affiliated with
groups in Canada, Japan, France, New Zealand and the Soviet Union.
Its stated mission is to ``protect and enhance the cold-water
fishery of North America.''
   In the past four years it has spent $700,000 on 135 projects to
improve fish habitat and water conservation. The
``Embrace-A-Stream'' program, which aims to get local communities
involved in improving their own natural resources, has been hailed
as innovative and effective.
   But lately TU has been casting its organizational net farther
afield.
   Last year it signed two agreements with the Union of Hunting and
Fishing, a 2.7 million-member group which controls 85 percent of
all land and water resources in the Soviet Union. TU said the
agreements call for exchanging research and management programs,
technical assistance and sportsmen.
   TU reports the Soviets and Americans are working out details to
allow U.S. anglers to fish for arctic char in Siberian waters and
visit rivers running into the Caspian Sea, where 40-pound brown
trout lie in wait.
   In 1987, a small Soviet delegation fished Colorado waters. Union
chief Alexander Ulitin said:
   ``We should put Reagan and Gorbachev together in a bass boat and
spread the papers out on the bottom. Then things would be better.''
   For as President Herbert Hoover once said:
   ``Fishing ... brings meekness and inspiration, reduces our
egotism, soothes our troubles and shames our wickedness. It is
discipline in the equality of men _ for all men are equal before
fish.''

   From the flat high desert of western
Wyoming a traveler looks far back over his shoulder to see distant
white clouds high in the northeastern sky.
   But what seems to be clouds are actually peaks that soar 13,000
feet high and straddle the Continental Divide for 120 miles.
   They are the Wind River mountains, and no one knows them better
than Finis (rhymes with highness) Mitchell.
   At 87, he is one of the few living Americans to have a physical
landmark _ 12,482-foot Mitchell Peak _ named after him by the U.S.
Geological Survey. It was the government's way of thanking him for
helping it correct topographical maps. He has a near-perfect memory
of the 2{ million acres of the Wind Rivers public patrimony.
   Mitchell earned the sobriquet ``Lord of the Winds'' by hiking
15,000 miles, climbing 276 peaks (some two dozen times) and
amassing more than 100,000 color slides of what he calls ``my back
yard.''
   He also is responsible for some of the finest fishing in the
world. Along with his wife, Emma, his father and brother, and a
string of pack horses, Mitchell stocked 314 of the 4,000 lakes in
the Wind Rivers a half century ago. From those, the fish migrated
to 700 others in the chain.
   Steep waterfalls and hostile terrain had previously kept them
barren of fish since their creation.
   ``These waters were all virgin and were just full of water lice,
leeches, freshwater shrimp ... so those fish just gorged
themselves,'' Mitchell wrote in his book ``Wind River Trails.''
   ``Some of the brook trout weighed 3 pounds the third year.''
   Today the Wind River Range is one of the finest high-altitude
fisheries anywhere.
   In 1906, when Mitchell's daddy traded 40 acres in Missouri for
160 acres at the foot of the Wind Rivers, the family moved west in
a boxcar with a wagon, two mules, a cow, a dog and a few household
treasures.
   They arrived in Rock Springs on April 26 and headed north only
to find their new land was worthless. Mitchell's father started
hauling freight at a penny a pound to feed his family, and
5-year-old Finis helped out. From then on, his life was a great
adventure centered in the Wind River mountains.
   ``The cutthroat trout were the only fish in the Wind Rivers,''
Mitchell said. ``They weighed about 12 pounds apiece. There were no
fish in the lakes unless somebody put them there. We think
sheepherders may have packed a few fish up there to have something
to eat.''
   As a young man Mitchell explored the mountains every chance he
got, but after marrying in 1925 he settled down in Rock Springs to
work for the Union Pacific Railroad.
   In 1930, the Great Depression cost him his job and the couple
took their chances living off the land after a bank failure wiped
out their savings.
   ``A hide buyer took us and all our stuff up into the
mountains,'' Mitchell recalled. ``I had 15 $20 bills. Two went to
the hide buyer and we were on our own.
   ``We followed a wagon track left over from the sheepmen's and
cattlemen's war of '03. When we got settled we decided to open a
fishing camp. We asked the Forest Service for a permit and they
said fine. We were the only ones doing it.''
   Mrs. Mitchell cooked meals for 50 cents apiece, her husband
borrowed 10 horses from friends and charged $1.50 a day to rent
them to fishermen. Soon folks from Rock Springs were coming up to
Mitchell's Fishing Camp for some badly needed fun in those hard
times.
   ``Only Big Sandy, Black Joe, Dad's, and a couple other lakes had
fish in them when we got started,'' said Mitchell.
   On their own, the Mitchells began stocking more. When
Superintendent Bill Rowley of the nearby Daniel Hatchery heard
about it, he came to see them.
   ``He said to me, `Finis, if you're going to run a fishing camp
you ought to stock other lakes, too. We don't have any money, but
we'll bring you the fish free if you'll pack 'em into the
mountains,''' Mitchell recalled.
   Rowley's hatchery was less than a decade old when he struck his
deal with Mitchell. The state of Wyoming provided a three-room log
cabin for the superintendent, the hired hand and his wife, and
their six children.
   Today the hatchery uses trucks with oxygen tanks and elaborate
cooling systems, as well as helicopters, to haul fish to lakes and
streams. Mitchell's and Rowley's methods of transportion were more
primitive.
   ``In the old days we used 5-gallon milk cans, a dozen at a
time,'' he said. ``The fish were an inch long and there were 1,000
in a can. We covered the tops of the cans with burlap and steadied
them by putting them in wooden apple crates which we tied to pack
horses.''
   Mrs. Mitchell's job was to walk the horses around in circles as
they arrived from the hatchery. That was to keep the water
splashing inside the cans, distributing oxygen to the fish and
keeping them from smothering.
   ``The men would all go inside our camp tent and eat and leave me
outside walking those pack animals,'' she said, recalling those
days with good humor.
   In 1939, the railroad recalled Mitchell. When the couple broke
camp and left the Wind Rivers to return to Rock Springs, they were
$4,000 in debt. But, for free, they'd stocked 2.5 million
cutthroat, rainbow, in many isolated lakes every
trout caught by a happy angler is directly descended from the ones
Finis and Emma Mitchell packed in 50 years ago.
   ``Trout multiplied into the millions, only to reach weights of 4
to 12 pounds and then die without seeing a single hook,'' Mitchell
wrote in his book, a small guide to the mountains which he sells
through mail order from his home.
   Finis Mitchell walks with the help of two sturdy sticks now, but
his aging legs haven't kept him from going to the mountains every
summer. He's been honored by his state with an honorary doctorate
of law, and by his nation when the Environmental Protection Agency
gave him its outstanding achievement award.
   But his biggest thrills still come in the Wind Rivers, walking
with young people.
   ``Children ask me who owns the mountains and I'm happy to tell
them `You own it,''' Mitchell said. ``It's true, too.''
   To remind Americans of their stewardship, he writes in every
copy of his book:
   ``This is your wilderness.
   ``Take only pictures,
   ``Leave only footprints,
   ``Kill nothing but time.''

   Tucked away in a corner of the Ritz
Sporting Goods store, across the room from a lunch counter
surrounded by a covey of good ol' boys drinking six cups of coffee
on one quarter, sits owner Sam Mavrakis.
   When he isn't selling fishing licenses or tackle, or swapping
lies with the coffee drinkers, he's holding court at the little
table littered with beautiful bits of fur and feathers.
   Without looking up from his flying fingers, Mavrakis keeps up a
running commentary about great fish he's known, famous people he's
guided and the merits of one trout stream over another.
   But it's not the colorful stories of visiting with Prince Philip
or fishing with Joe DiMaggio that keep his audience enthralled:
It's his flashing fingers. Mavrakis is one of the West's best
artificial fly tiers. Every fly he sells in his store, located in
the heart of some of America's best fishing country, is hand-tied.
   And like thousands of other fishermen who've channeled their
summertime love of fly fishing into wintertime fly tying, he needs
very specific materials to create fake critters to lure trout
straight out of a river and onto a hook.
   Without realizing it, Mavrakis, like fly tiers from Japan to
Tasmania, Venezuela to Iceland, and all points in between, is
largely dependent on three men.
   They are a Wyoming elk hide tanner, a New Hampshire cotton
spinner and a Pennsylvania chicken farmer. Together they form the
tripod of international fly tying because they provide nearly all
the commercial raw materials needed to practice the art.
   Each stumbled into the lucrative business by accident.
   Steve Kennerk, owner of Rocky Mountain Dubbing in Riverton,
Wyo., was a hide tanner whose clientele dropped off because of his
state's depressed economy. He now provides nearly all the wild
animal hair used by foreign factories to manufacture the bulk of
ready-made artificial flies.
   ``I export to 16 countries and have been named this year's
Wyoming Exporter of the Year,'' said Kennerk, whose tanning
techniques are self-taught and secret.
   ``Last year I had gross sales of $225,000, with 90 percent of my
business now concentrated in providing hair for flies. It's growing
about 40 percent a year.''
   He has a new catalog listing the 26 colors of the animal hair he
tans and dyes, including caribou, Australian possum, deer, elk,
moose and rabbit.
   Caught by surprise at the success of what started in 1981 as a
sideline, Kennerk now has five full-time employees and pays 16
mentally handicapped youngsters to bag and label his products. He
also buys hides from local hunters who pump that money back into
Riverton, and is doubling the size of his building.
   Ray Merrick's Danville Chenille Co. has been in business 55
years. It began by providing chenille _ a cotton yarn twisted
together around a hard core _ for ladies' hats and handbags. But
fashions changed and in the late 1950s, when Merrick's family
bought the New Hampshire firm, its product was popular mainly with
hobbyists. Most chenille was then sold for novelty items, such as
pipe cleaners.
   Recently the boom in fly tying has created a whole new market
for chenille, which forms the body of the fly. Merrick's company is
now the world's major supplier of the product named after the
French word for caterpillar.
   ``We grossed $550,000 last year, with all but $50,000 of that
from our fish and tackle business,'' said Merrick, who employs 11
full-time and five part-time workers.
   ``We have so many orders it's going like crazy around here.
One-third of our sales are to fly factories in Hong Kong and
Singapore, and to people in Japan, Mauritius, New Zealand, England,
Australia _ all over.''
   Buck Metz's chicken hatchery in Bellville, Pa., anchors the
third corner of the raw materials triangle.
   His father, grandfather and uncle started the chicken farm in
the late 1930s.
   ``It was a commercial poultry operation. We raised chickens for
meat and eggs,'' said Metz, who now runs the hatchery with his
brother, John.
   ``We got into providing specialty neck feathers because I needed
them to tie my own flies and they were very hard to come by. Before
us, most of the hackles came hit-and-miss from India and the
Philippines.''
   Metz bought his first specialty chickens in 1972 from breeds
that had been genetically modified to produce unique neck feathers.
``My dad thought I was crazy when I paid $10,000 for 150
chickens,'' he said.
   Last year that division of the family business took in nearly
$1.5 million, while the farm's regular chicken and egg sales
totaled $3 million.
   ``I realized within two years that there was an unknown level of
demand out there for our hackle production,'' said Metz, referring
to the prized neck feathers of his pedigreed poultry.
   ``We've been trying ever since to find out how big the market
is, but it keeps growing faster than we can keep up with it.
   ``We have 35 distributors in Europe, Asia and South America, as
well as here, and we're far and away the largest feather supplier
to fly tiers in the world.''
   Metz now employs 60 full-time and 60 part-time workers to give
his 100,000 pampered chickens the individual care they require.
   ``These are somewhat delicate birds, prone to diseases more than
commercial strains of poultry, and each one has to be individually
caged to protect them from each other,'' he said.
   Kennerk, Merrick and Metz all know about each other and their
importance to fly tiers.
   They have another thing in common: They're avid fly fishermen
who're now so busy working they don't have time to go fishing
anymore.

   In the beginning, they were one, but more and
more Garry Shandling the character is leading a life apart from
Garry Shandling the actor.
   Originally, events from Shandling's real life provided the comic
fodder for ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' which he calls a cross
between a situation comedy and ``Outer Limits.''
   The set was built to look like Shandling's house in the
Hollywood Hills and his real-life experiences _ from girlfriend
trouble to a doting mother _ were exaggerated and given a comic
twist.
   Now, he says, ``We've broken away from real life. We've had some
hypothetical situations I've never been in. I draw on attitudes,
but we greavu things and then imaginepPqe an extension of the
television show. But it will be as offbeat.''

   Actress Angela Lansbury, making a return
engagement as hostess for tonight's ``1988 Tony Awards,'' wants to
get back to Broadway where she collected her share of the prizes in
earlier years.
   ``I think there's an electricity that takes place in the theater
and nowhere else but in the theater,'' says Miss Lansbury, familiar
to TV audiences as Jessica Fletcher on ``Murder, She Wrote.'' ``It
makes you want to get back to it. Applause, applause, you know.
It's meat and potatoes to us.''
   Three musicals received 10 nominations for Tonys, which go to
the best of Broadway from the season just ending. They're Andrew
Lloyd Webber's ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' Stephen Sondheim's
``Into the Woods'' and a revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes.''
   The CBS producers of the awards presentations, which will be
televised from Broadway's Minskoff Theater, invited Miss Lansbury
back for a second year as hostess.
   ``Last year, it intrigued and honored me enough that I felt I
had to host it,'' Miss Lansbury said by telephone from her home in
Southern California.
   ``Through my connection with `Murder, She Wrote,' I knew I was
going to be welcome in the nation's living rooms. Some people saw
me glamorously gowned for the first time.''
   Miss Lansbury became known in Hollywood at 17, became a star on
Broadway at 40 in ``Mame,'' and became a TV star at 59, as Jessica
Fletcher, who writes and solves mysteries.
   She was nominated for an Academy Award for her first movie,
``Gaslight,'' and twice more, for ``The Picture of Dorian Gray''
and ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' where she played Laurence
Harvey's mother. She also played Elvis Presley's mother in ``Blue
Hawaii'' and Elizabeth Taylor's sister in ``National Velvet.''
   On Broadway, she was in only three shows, ``Hotel Paradiso,''
``A Taste of Honey'' and ``Anyone Can Whistle,'' before she started
winning Tonys. She has Tonys for the musicals ``Mame,'' ``Dear
World,'' ``Gypsy'' and ``Sweeney Todd.''
   About her gown for this year's show, Miss Lansbury says,
``That's a prime concern for a woman. We're going to try to outdo
ourselves this year.''
   Last year she appeared first in a gown of dramatically
contrasting panels of black and white and later wore glittering
gold.
   ``I'm lucky enough to be gowned by Bob Mackie, a great Hollywood
designer,'' she says. ``He created one of the most stunning gowns
I've ever seen last year _ the black-and-white creation.
   ``It's such a great dress I cannot let it hang in a bag in a
closet. I'm sure it will go into one of the Hollywood museums _ if
I can keep it away from my granddaughter. She's a big
dresser-upper. She's only 3.
   ``My son _ her father _ is director Anthony Shaw. He directed a
lot of `Murder, She Wrote,' which is very nice. My daughter has a
restaurant with her husband in Italy.''
   Another concern is the strike by the Writers Guild of America.
   ``Last year, a tremendous amount of what I did say was me,'' she
says. ``I told them I didn't want to get up there and spout a lot
of things I wouldn't be comfortable saying. I wanted to talk from
the heart.
   ``This year, I don't know how they'll script. With everything
that has been written about the shows, it would be possible for me
to put together anything that's needed. If necessary, that's what
I'll do.''
   Earlier in May, the 62-year-old actress made an exercise and
lifestyle tape. ``It's how to keep your body moving, light and
graceful and how to keep your energy up,'' she says. ``I throw in
all sorts of homilies about rest and exercise and how to get the
most out of life.''
   This season's ``Murder, She Wrote'' series kept her working long
hours from last July 5 to early May, Miss Lansbury says. ``We shot
25 episodes. Normally we do 22. We had the scripts so we decided
we'd go ahead, so we'd have something to start the new season with.
We hope to start back Aug. 1. We have no way of knowing. We're in
the midst of this dreadful strike. People are rather grim about
it.''
   At the end of next season, Miss Lansbury says, ``My five-year
stint on `Murder, She Wrote' will be over. I cannot stay, on a
week-to-week basis. Perhaps we can work out an arrangement where I
do several a year, which would leave me free to do other things.
That's what I want.
   ``Especially when you get up in my years, if you're still
energetic, which I am, and still love working in the theater,
movies and TV, you want to feel you've got some time to do it. I
really think I'm one of the luckiest people on two feet. I do have
tremendous stamina and energy.''

<HEAD>Soviets Clear Forest to Build New Town for Chernobyl Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SLAVUTICH, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what once was an evergreen forest,
thousands of workers are building a new town with stores,
apartments and houses for 30,000 Chernobyl nuclear plant workers
and their families.
   But those coming and going to work at Chernobyl 30 miles to the
west will have to pass first through a long metal building filled
with rows of gray lockers and sensors with green and red lights.
   In the building by the railroad tracks, the sensors will check
the workers for radioactive contamination. The lockers will hold
their work clothes.
   ``Every person much be checked,'' said Alexander Gasenko, deputy
director of the Kombinat agency that oversees the Chernobyl plant
and the area surrounding it.
   More than 135,000 people were evacuated from the zone around the
nuclear plant after the explosion and fire April 26, 1986, at
Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor. At least 31 people were killed and a
cloud of radioactive material eventually circled the globe.
   Pripyat, once a city of 50,000 within sight of the Chernobyl's
towering stacks, has become a nuclear ghost town.
   Its nine-story apartment buildings stand empty, lamps with
various colored shades remain in the window of a department store
and spindly weeds grow on the light-brown dirt brought in to
replace the contaminated soil that was scraped off and buried.
   The Chernobyl plant's 4,400 workers and their families were
hastily removed by a fleet of more than 1,000 buses and scattered
to new homes in Kiev, Chernigov and cities of southern Byelorussia.
But later this year, if they want to continue to work at Chernobyl,
they will have to move to Slavutich. Each Soviet nuclear power
plant requires its personnel to live together in one city.
   The few hundred people who began moving into Slavutich in March
are checked for radiation every time they travel to and from the
plant.
   One sensor checks them when they enter the long metal building.
They pick up their work clothes from their lockers, walk through an
open area to another sensor where they stand with their hands held
high, change their clothes and then walk out past a third sensor to
the train that will take them to work.
   When construction is finished, shuttle trains will take the
workers to their jobs at the nuclear power station in 34 minutes,
officials said on a recent press tour.
   The officials said the area was slightly contaminated by fallout
from the Chernobyl accident, but it poses no danger now for the new
settlers.
   The few residents on hand for the press tour agreed.
   ``I think everything is all right,'' said teacher Lyudmila
Zabarina, who has two young children. ``I don't think it's
dangerous.''
   Yuri and Alexander, young electricians from nearby Chernigov now
living temporarily in metal barracks in the nearby village of
Lesnoi, said they were convinced the area was safe.
   Mayor Alexander Pankov said Soviet authorities ordered the
construction of the new town in October 1986, and set aside 650
acres of land and 426 million rubles ($680 million) for the
construction.
   Slavutich, in the northern Ukraine where it meets Russia and
Byelorussia, is being built by teams of workers from eight of the
15 Soviet republics.
   Estonian builders have put up small, dark brown wooden houses.
   Houses built by the Latvians are of red brick.
   Moscow and Leningrad builders have put up large apartment
complexes around remaining wooded areas.
   One kindergarten is finished, as is the school that will take an
estimated 1,200 students aged 6 to 17 in the fall.
   Mrs. Zabarina, an English teacher, said the school opened this
spring with about a dozen teachers and 60 students.
   Basic food industries also will be built, and their workers will
also live in Slavutich, officials said.
   But right now, the roads are unpaved, few buildings are finished
and fewer are inhabited.
   Soviet workers are accustomed to such rush projects, which have
been a part of the economy for decades. In the rapid
industrialization beginning in the early 1930s, whole cities were
built in short spans of time for workers at the huge factories.
   Many such cities were poorly built, but the new residents of
Slavutich expect their city to be different.
   Mrs. Zabarina, whose husband works as an organizer for the
Communist youth organization, said their previous town offered none
of the cultural or sporting facilities of her new home.
   ``I'm amazed,'' she said. ``It will be a beautiful city.''

<HEAD>Summit Takes Over Soviet Capital's Busiest Buildings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the gilded splendor of Kremlin reception
halls to a mock-Western hotel frequented by foreign businessmen and
KGB prostitutes, Moscow's busiest landmarks are being pressed into
service for this week's U.S.-Soviet summit.
   President Reagan, Soviet Communist Party General Secretary
Mikhail Gorbachev, hundreds of staff workers and thousands of
journalists will occupy just a few buildings in the city, but their
presence will be dominating.
   The official meetings will take place in the Kremlin, seat of
Soviet power. And although they don't live within the fortress
walls, the Gorbachevs will give a state dinner there for the
Reagans, who will be hosts for a reciprocal affair at their summit
quarters, the U.S. ambassador's residence known as Spaso House.
   The official American entourage and much of the White House
press accompanying Reagan will be housed at the Mezhdunarodnaya
(International) Hotel attached to the Moscow Center for
International Trade. The hotel also will serve as headquarters for
an international press corps now estimated to number at least 5,000.
   Many of the visiting journalists will stay at the mammoth
3,200-room Rossiya Hotel between Red Square and the Kremlin,
although officials have said some outlying hotels also will be used
to handle the flood of reporters, photographers and technicians.
   Here are historical notes and descriptions of the principal
summit venues:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE KREMLIN:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The delta-shaped fortress that today encloses the Soviet
government and Communist Party leadership behind russet, crenelated
walls dates back to the 15th century at the site of a former
``White Stone'' Kremlin.
   Inside the Kremlin walls, bordered by the Moscow River, Red
Square and the Alexander Gardens that run along bustling Prospekt
Marx, are a jumble of czarist palaces, cathedrals, government
buildings and state museums, including the Armory, which houses
Faberge eggs, gold, Peter the Great's high boots and other Kremlin
treasures and memorabilia.
   The leaders will likely meet at some time during the summit in
the rose-and-silver-colored Hall of St. Catherine, a 19th century
remnant of the Russo-Byzantine-style Imperial residence that is now
the Grand Kremlin Palace.
   The most stringent security measures in a capital known for
caution are practiced at the Kremlin, where the three main gates
are manned by dozens of uniformed KGB border guards and access even
to the roads leading up to the gates is restricted.
   During the meetings and festivities connected with the summit,
the broad stretches of asphalt and cobblestone between the historic
buildings will be black with freshly polished ZIL limousines used
to shuttle Soviet dignitaries, as well as the American vehicles
that will be flown in for use by Reagan and his senior staff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SPASO HOUSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The yellow New Empire-style mansion, which takes its name from
the small Spasopeskovskaya Square out front and a nearby Russian
Orthodox cathedral, will house Reagan, his wife, Nancy, and their
personal staff during their five-day stay in Moscow.
   The Reagans will stay in the second-floor guest quarters that
had been known as the Vice Presidential Suite but will be renamed
in honor of its new guests, according to U.S. Embassy press attache
Richard Gilbert.
   Ambassador Jack Matlock and his wife, Rebecca, plan to stay in
their own quarters in the mansion for the presidential visit.
   Spaso House, a two-story dwelling with a columned front portico,
was built in 1914 on the grounds inhabited in the 17th century by
the czar's dog-keepers and falconers. Its wealthy builder, Nikolai
Vtorov, was killed shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and
the mansion was expropriated by the Soviet government.
   It was turned over to the United States in 1933, when William C.
Bullitt arrived as the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union.
   The mansion and its surrounding gardens have been the scene of
raucous celebrations such as the one on Christmas Eve 1934,
recalled in Charles W. Thayer's book ``Bears in the Caviar,'' when
animals borrowed from the Moscow Zoo went beserk in the ballroom.
Premier Nikita Khrushchev attended lawn parties there when he was
still in power.
   In World War II, a bomb shelter was built in the mansion's
basement, and the ambassador and his staff evacuated to the Volga
River city of Kuibyshev in late 1941 when German troops drew close
to the city and air raids broke an occasional window.
   The vaulted ceilings and doric columns that distinguish the
interior are complimented by cream, navy and mauve furnishings. A
collection of ultra-modern art, chosen by the Matlocks, hangs on
the marble walls as part of the ``Art in Embassies'' program.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MEZHDUNARODNAYA HOTEL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The modern, slate-gray towers of the American-designed hotel and
business complex known among foreigners as ``The Mezh'' is an
island of Western life that is for the most part off-limits to
Soviet citizens.
   The Mezh, derived from the Russian word ``mezhdunarodnaya,''
meaning international, is so different from most Soviet business
and residential buildings that filmmakers use the interior to
portray American venues. In the 1985 film ``We Accuse,'' about the
U-2 spy plane s news agency says 5,000 reporters have sought
accreditation for the summit, and the White House and Soviet
Foreign Ministry agreed the second-floor Congress Hall was the only
place in the city that could accommodate a press center. Even so,
it will seat fewer than 1,000 of those expected.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE ROSSIYA HOTEL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Twice ravaged by fire, the 5,500-bed Rossiya will serve as home
and office for the world's broadcast media.
   Television and radio teams have built studio sets on the
west-wing balconies overlooking Red Square and the Kremlim, from
which the nightly news on all four American networks will be
anchored.
   The 12-story hotel, which took 25 years of haggling, design
change and behind-the-scenes debate to complete, opened its first
rooms in late 1966 and was completed in 1971. It has restaurants,
six bars, a film theater and a concert hall.
   Fire struck the north wing Feb. 25, 1977, and at least 30 people
were killed. An exploding television set in one of the rooms was
blamed for a Jan. 8, 1987, blaze that killed one woman.
   The hotel's location near the most popular sights of the Soviet
capital has made it a favorite with tourists for the past 20 years.
The familiar onion domes of St. Basil's Cathedral and a half-dozen
small churches relocated to the site during construction projects
around Moscow stand in stark contrast to the modern steel, glass
and concrete Rossiya. To the north is the State Department Store,
GUM, and across Red Square are Spassky Tower, the Kremlin wall
burial ground and Lenin's red-marble mausoleum.

<HEAD>Moscow Summit Is 15th Meeting Between Leaders of Superpowers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Reagan arrives in Moscow on Sunday
for talks with Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev, it will mark the third visit by a U.S. president to the
Soviet Union and the 15th summit between leaders of the two
superpowers since 1955.
   Here is a rundown of the superpower summits to date:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Geneva, July 18-23, 1955</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Eisenhower met with Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin
and the leaders of England and France to discuss the reunification
of Germany. Eisenhower suggested that the United States and the
Soviets allow mutual air reconnaissance over their military
installations. Nuclear disarmament was discussed generally.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Camp David, Md., Sept. 25-27, 1959</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev met with Eisenhower on a
two-week visit to the United States. They agreed to reopen
negotiations on the status of Berlin and issued a communique
calling disarmament an important issue.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Paris, May 16, 1960</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The meeting collapsed on its opening day after Khrushchev
demanded an apology from Eisenhower for the American U-2 incident.
The jet had been shot down on a spy mission over the Soviet Union.
He also withdrew an invitation for Eisenhower to visit the Soviet
Union the next month.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Vienna, Austria, June 3-4, 1961</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Talks between President Kennedy and Khrushchev produce no
agreement on a nuclear test ban and arms control. The two leaders
issued a joint communique affirming their support for a neutral
Laos and declaring a willingness to maintain contact.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Glassboro, N.J., June 23-25, 1967</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin met in two
sessions but resolved no U.S.-Soviet differences. Among the issues
discussed: the Vietnam War, the Arab-Israeli war and nuclear arms.
Kosygin was in the United States to address the United Nations.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Moscow, May 22-24, 1972</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Nixon became the first U.S. president to visit Moscow.
He and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev signed agreements on
health, environment, and space and scientific cooperation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Washington, June 18-25, 1973</HEAD>

   Brezhnev and Nixon signed a pledge to try to reach a general
agreement to end the nuclear arms race in 1974 and to cooperate in
trying to avoid international confrontations.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Moscow, June 27-July 3, 1974</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At their third summit, Nixon and Brezhnev signed a number of
limited documents on nuclear weapons, among them an agreement not
to conduct underground nuclear weapons tests of more than 150
kilotons. Brezhnev said the arms agreements ``could have been
broader,'' and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said pending
impeachment efforts hampered Nixon's negotiating stance.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Vladivostok, U.S.S.R., Nov. 23-24, 1974</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Ford and Brezhnev reached tentative agreement to limit
the number of strategic offensive nuclear weapons and delivery
vehicles, including multiple warhead missiles.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Helsinki, Finland, July 30-Aug. 2, 1975</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Ford and Brezhnev were among leaders of 35 nations meeting on
European security. Brezhnev and Ford held talks on strategic arms
issues and reported ``encouraging progress.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Vienna, June 15-18, 1979</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Carter and Brezhnev concluded seven years of strategic
arms limitation talks with the signing of the SALT II treaty. They
also generally agreed to hold regular summit meetings.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Geneva, Nov. 19-21, 1985</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reagan and Gorbachev spent far more time in private sessions
than had been planned but failed to reach any breakthrough on major
issues. Several agreements were signed, however, including cultural
and scientific exchanges, aviation cooperation and consular
exchanges. Reagan termed the meeting a ``fresh start'' in relations
between the nations.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Reykjavik, Iceland, Oct. 11-12, 1986</HEAD>

   Reagan and Gorbachev held detailed discussions over arms
control, but failed to reach agreement following a dispute over the
U.S. strategic defense initiative, better known as Star Wars. Both
sides accused the other of being inflexible, and no date was set
for a summit in the United States, which had been a purpose of the
Iceland session.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Washington, Dec. 8-10, 1987</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Here are brief biographical sketches of the top
Soviet officials likely to be at the side of Soviet Communist Party
General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev at his summit meeting this week
with President Reagan.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUARD A. SHEVARDNADZE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 60-year-old foreign minister has been the main Soviet
contact with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on summit
planning. Earlier this month in Geneva, he and Shultz tackled the
final problems holding up U.S. Senate ratification of the treaty
banning medium- and shorter-range nuclear weapons. The two also
tried to resolve the differences over a treaty to cut in half the
superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons.
   Shevardnadze, the only non-Slavic member of the 13-member ruling
Politburo, succeeded Andrei A. Gromyko as foreign minister in July
1985, less than four months after Gorbachev took power.
   The white-haired Shevardnadze has given Soviet diplomacy a more
personable face than Gromyko, frequently smiling and joking with
reporters. He and Shultz have developed what both describe as a
good rapport in their frequent meetings.
   Before becoming foreign minister, Shevardnadze headed the
Communist Party in the Georgian republic, where he gained a
reputation for cracking down on rampant corruption.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALEXANDER N. YAKOVLEV</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A former Columbia University exchange student and ambassador to
Canada, Yakovlev's career has skyrocketed with that of Gorbachev.
Yakovlev, the 64-year-old Communist Party propaganda chief, is
considered the chief architect of the general secretary's
``glasnost,'' or openness policy. He has played a prominent role in
liberalizing Soviet cultural life.
   Yakovlev became head of the Central Committee propaganda
department in 1985, a candidate member of the Politburo in January
1987 and a full member just five months later.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANATOLY F. DOBRYNIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   When Dobrynin returned to Moscow from the United States as a
Central Committee secretary, he transformed the Central Committee
International Department from an organization dealing largely with
non-ruling Communist parties to one that engages in hands-on
diplomacy with non-Communist politicians. This was once the
exclusive domain of the Foreign Ministry.
   Dobrynin, 68, had been ambassador to the United States for an
unprecedented 25 years. During his Washington tenure, the tall,
rotund Dobrynin gained a reputation as a charming but tough
diplomat and a skillful chess player.
   He has accompanied Gorbachev to every summit with Reagan, in
Geneva; Reykjavik, Iceland, and Washington.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SERGEI F. AKHROMEYEV</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A marshal of the Soviet army, the 65-year-old Akhromeyev dropped
by the Pentagon during the Washington summit for a brief tour. He
is the Soviet Union's military chief of staff and a first deputy
defense minister.
   Akhromeyev took part in the Reykjavik arms control negotiations,
where an American participant said, ``He was tough and determined,
but he was trying to get an agreement.''
   A soldier since 1940, Akhromeyev has wide command experience. In
1984, he replaced Nikolai Ogarkov as chief of staff.

<TEXT>
   A key figure in Soviet foreign policy for more than three
decades, Gromyko now holds the largely ceremonial post of
president. As head of state, he will greet Reagan upon arrival in
Moscow. He spends most of his time now on domestic concerns,
chairing meetings of the country's parliament, the Supreme Soviet,
and officiating at Kremlin awards presentations.
   But he remains a Politburo member, and as such keeps his hand in
foreign affairs by meeting with visiting foreign dignitaries.
   Gromyko, 78, was at various times ambassador to the United
States, to the United Nations and to Britain. But he is best known
as foreign minister, a post he held from 1957 to 1985.

   Every evening around 7, the thudding,
rumbling and clashing that have filled the convention center for
11{ hours suddenly cease. For 15 minutes, there's silence.
   Then the organ swells. Spectators cheer. Gold curtains snap
open. And 200 bowlers, their faces flushed with pride and
embarrassment, march up the center aisle, flanked by 20 gleaming
bowling alleys.
   Uh, strike that. We don't use ``alley'' anymore. And hey! Get
your mind out of the gutter. Take it from the American Bowling
Congress: ``Gutter'' is out. ``Channel'' is in.
   Ask Joe Bowler and you get a different opinion.
   ``A gutter's a gutter,'' says Joe, better known as 33-year-old
Rick Haemmerle of Indianapolis. Chosen at random to represent
bowlers everywhere, he was crowned Feb. 13, opening day of the 85th
annual ABC tournament that ended in Jacksonville last week.
   Question: How long does it take 38,000 bowlers from 50 states
and nine foreign countries bowling 18 hours a day, seven days a
week, to bowl 341,430 games, thereby toppling 58 million pins?
   Answer: 103 days, which is about 102 longer than it takes to
realize that bowling is experiencing an identity crisis.
   Gutter or channel? Recreation or sport? Ralph Kramden or Ralph
Lauren?
   Don't be fooled by the plastic bowler-in-a-seashell, the ``beer
frame'' keychains and other doo-dads for sale at the tournament.
Out on the lanes, bowling's taking the high road: No smoking. No
shorts. No collarless shirts. No drinking. NO HOT DOGS. You're here
to bowl, not to eat.
   What's gotten into bowling? Where'd all that high-tech equipment
come from?
   A black rubber ball in a zippered bag was good enough for Ralph
Kramden. Today, it's three, four, five balls. Rubber balls.
Urethane balls. Polyester balls. In purple. Blue. YELLOW, for
heaven's sake. Carried in _ are you ready for this, Norton? _
battery-heated, insulated, temperature-controlled bowling bags.
   Behold the modern bowling pin: Laminated on the outside, holes
on the inside. The slightest tap and it's to the moon, Alice!
   Consider the lane: Spread a little oil on today's
urethane-coated surfaces and it's bang, zoom! To the pocket, Alice!
   ``Nah, I don't practice,'' says Joe Bowler. ``If you're not
hitting your shot, you just buy another ball. I carry five of the
urethanes.''
   Alas, five aren't always enough. In his first official act, Joe
Bowler opened the tournament with a gutterball. What do you want
from a guy forced to bowl in front of 2,234 people while wearing a
robe and a crown?
   Bowling's split personality begins to make sense when you
consider that there's bowling the sport, and then there's bowling
the game.
   Bowling the sport is math, physics and sophisticated terms like
``coefficient of friction'' and ``kinetic energy.''
   Bowling the game is nachos, chili dogs and simple terms like
``Miller'' and ``Bud.''
   Unlike the sport, the game has no image problem. It couldn't
care less, an attitude that irks the sport no end.
   Let the sport compile all those demographics about how
young-bright-affluent its 68 million participants are. Let it lie
awake nights worrying about the impression it makes.
   The game has better things to do, like order another
cheeseburger.
   The American Bowling Congress, gatekeeper of the sport and
recipient of $10 million in dues from 3.4 million league bowlers,
stresses skill, complexity, pride and tradition.
   The National Bowling Council, the industry's advertising arm,
and AMF and Brunswick, its largest manufacturers, stress leisure,
recreation and fun, fun, fun.
   Eddie Wise, a 9-year-old who pushed his bowling ball two-handed
to a near-perfect 299, was immortalized in the early '80s in a
Brunswick ad promoting easy-to-topple pins. In the same era, the
Young American Bowling Alliance put an orangutan on the cover of
its magazine, and the National Bowling Council enthusiastically
promoted a ``Real People'' segment featuring a bowling pig.
   Fun for all ages! Anyone can play! You don't have to be good.
You don't have to be a grown-up. You don't even have to be human!
   Bowling's critics say it's going to the dogs.
   Its kingpins say it's going to the Olympics.
   What's a swell game like bowling doing in a mess like this?
   It didn't get there overnight.
   The ancient Egyptians were bowlers; it's been traced back to
5200 BC.
   Germans bowled in the 6th century; Martin Luther in the 16th. In
those days, the game was called ninepins, ``lawn bowling'' in
England, where Henry VIII banned it as ``a form of vicious
gambling.''
   No respect, even then.
   Lawn bowling and ``skittles,'' a Dutch game, got a warm welcome
in the New World, where tavern owners embraced them as a way to
boost beer sales.
   It didn't take long for gambling charges to resurface. Prim and
proper Connecticut banned ninepins in the late 1830s. That might
have been the end of that, had not some enterprising soul _
evidence points to one Jonathan Coe of Madison, Conn. _
circumvented the law by adding a 10th pin. Bowling was legalized in
1841.
   Like other German immigrants, bowling headed West in the 19th
century. It settled in the Midwest, still bowling's stronghold with
Michigan No. 1.
   Bowling generally thrives wherever blue-collar and shift workers
are found. ``If you work from 7 to 5, you don't have time for
daylight sports like golf or tennis. Bowling is something you can
do at night,'' says Steve Harding, a bowler who owns a pizzeria in
Sherman, Texas.
   Almost from the beginning, would-be bureaucrats descended on
bowling, bent on organizing, standardizing and merchandizing what
was, until the late 1800s, a haphazard affair involving however
many pins of whatever shapes and sizes happened to be on hand.
   That all changed in 1895, when the American Bowling Congress
first met, in New York. Formed to represent bowlers' interests, the
ABC quickly adopted the 300-point scoring system and set uniform
standards for pins, balls and lanes.
   And what did it get for its trouble? It got trouble.
   The bickering started almost immediately: High scores vs. high
standards. Commercial interests vs. bowler interests. Sport vs.
game.
   Bad press dogged bowling from the beginning (Ever read ``Rip van
Winkle?''), only to be replaced many years later by something
infinitely worse: no press at all.
   Legislators picked on bowling. In some states, it was illegal
for minors to walk to or from a bowling alley unless accompanied by
an adult. Those laws were repealed in the 1950s.
   By that time, bowling had reached new heights of respectability.
The glamorous beer teams, touring the country in their all-white,
good-guy outfits, helped boost bowling's image, along with sales of
Stroh's, Falstaff, Budweiser and Pfeiffer. Automatic pin-spotters
brought respectability, just as the National Child Labor Committee
was about to crack down on the low pay and late hours given
erstwhile pinboys. And women developed an affinity for the game,
prompting proprietors to class up the joints.
   As Ralph Kramden went, so went the nation. Between the mid '40s
and the mid '60s, the number of league bowlers quadrupled.
Suddenly, everyone was going bowling _ 4.5 million people
regularly, in ABC-sanctioned leagues.

<HEAD>JACKSONVILLE: ABC-sanctioned leagues.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   From 1955 to 1960, membership in the Women's International
Bowling Congress rose by 150 percent.
   Entrepreneurs were quick to spring into action. A little too
much action, it turned out.
   In 1944, there were 38,203 bowling lanes.
   By 1964, there were 159,079.
   So ended ``The Competitive Era'' of bowling. So began ``The
Commercial Era.'' So says Dr. George Allen of Tempe, Ariz., a
former college professor with four decades of involvement in
bowling and a Ph.D. in finance.
   He's also the author of two scholarly volumes on industry trends
that combine a desire to drag bowling's leaders behind the woodshed
with a penchant for capital letters. ``NO INDUSTRY OR ORGANIZATION
HAS AN INHERENT RIGHT TO EXIST FOREVER,'' he writes.
   Allen considers bowling a sport, and he'd like you to. Actually,
what he'd really like is for you to consider it ``a microcosm of
life itself,'' but what the heck. He's a reasonable guy.
   Besides, this is no time to argue. ``Bowling,'' Allen warns,
``is on the verge of extinction,'' done in by bouncy pins and
urethane balls with built-in hooking power, unscrupulous lane
conditions and greedy commercial interests.
   If it's true that the sport of bowling is dying, Allen thinks
the business of bowling is what's killing it. ``We have eroded the
integrity of the SPORT of bowling to create the RECREATION of
bowling,'' according to the text of a speech to the Bowling
Proprietors Association of America in 1986.
   Meanwhile, recreational bowlers are scoring up a storm.
   The same 213 average that made one Detroiter the highest-ranked
bowler in his league in 1987 puts him between 50th and 60th on this
year's roster.
   Consider the perfect game: 12 strikes, for a score of 300, once
so rare that the ABC gave a 14-carat gold ring to anyone who
managed to pull it off.
   Today, the same ring costs a bowler $350. The free ones are
silver-plated _ a good thing for the ABC, considering the number of
perfect games bowled last year: 8,537, up from 1,375 a decade ago.
   Honor scores in general _ 300, 299 or 298 for a single game or
800 for a three-game series _ totaled 21,022 for 1987, exceeding
the totals for 1977, 1978 and 1979 combined.
   During a single day of competition at a tournament in Hartford,
Conn., in April, there were four perfect games.
   Kathy McBride, who works the counter at Bowl-Era Lanes in
Hammond, Ind., still remembers the excitement of the center's first
300 game. ``It was a big day. Of course, that was five years ago.
So far this year, we've had six.''
   At Bowl-Era, ``180 used to be considered a high average. Now
we're seeing 225 averages. Last year, my own family brought home 16
trophies. Finally, I told them, `Enough!'''
   Bill Taylor of Pasadena, Calif., has had enough, too. Taylor is
a self-appointed guardian of the sport's integrity _ what's left of
it, anyway.
   He'd sooner lock bowling in its room than let it strut its stuff
as scheduled in a one-day exhibition the day before opening
ceremonies at the summer Olympics in Seoul.
   ``Bowling is not going to any parties until it cleans itself
up,'' vows Taylor, a former pro coach who now manufactures his own
line of ``honest'' pins and lane finishes, products he insists
would solve the whole problem. Products he claims the ABC refuses
to approve. The ABC says he's never asked.
   Bowling, says Taylor, ``has become a low-life game. A
24-year-old with a 227 average just bowled his 14th career 300
game. If the great bowlers of the past were here instead of in
their graves, they would shoot him.
   ``A bowling lane today is the equivalent of a concave golf green
with a 36-inch cup,'' contends Taylor, who, using a speed trap of
his own invention, recently clocked a bowling pin at 42 feet per
second. ``In the old days, they traveled 16 feet, 17 feet per
second. Now they're flying all over the deck.''
   Next to bouncy pins, nothing makes Taylor madder than
``blocked'' lanes.
   Oil is applied to bowling lanes to protect them from the
friction of the landing ball as well as to provide a ``skid'' area,
thereby enabling the ball to follow the ``skid-roll-hook'' pattern
required for effective delivery.
   How to apply that protective coating is infinitely more
complicated.
   Taylor believes _ and he has lots of company _ that
less-than-scrupulous bowling centers have ``learned how to place
oil on the lanes to reguide errant shots into the pocket. This lane
blocking, along with today's powerful balls, has made bad bowlers
appear good. We have horrible bowlers now.''
   Not so, says Wally Hall, vice president of the Bowling
Proprietors Association of America and chairman of Fairlanes Corp.,
which owns 4,000 lanes, more than any other chain.
   ``What we have today is an extremely skilled sport. Technical
improvements may well have helped. But I do not agree that today's
bowlers aren't as good.
   ``Some proprietors _ not the majority, but a few _ are using oil
as a marketing strategy,'' Hall concedes. ``But the average bowler
isn't able to exploit those conditions.''
   The oil crisis has been under closer scrutiny than OPEC by the
ever-vigilant ABC, whose previous efforts to resolve it have
succeeded only in further depleting its stock of honor-score rings.
   ``We want to see any rule change result in a condition that is
fair and competitive to all bowlers, and that will leave the pride
of accomplishment in the hands of the bowlers instead of the
maintenance people,'' ABC assistant secretary-treasurer Burt
Kellermann says through clenched teeth.
   At the tournament in Jacksonville, lanes were constantly
monitored to ensure the same conditions for each bowler, as well as
to prevent lanes from becoming blocked.
   This meticulous maintenance may have accounted for both the low
numbers on the scoreboard and the long faces in the parking lot.
   ``A lot of people take bowling too seriously,'' confides Joe
Bowler, whose mother went bowling the night she gave birth to him.
``Mom was tough. I grew up with, `Head down! Don't bend your wrist!
Keep your damn shoulder up!' She used to be a killer. Now she's in
it for fun.''
   For what it's worth, Joe Bowler has never done well at the ABC
tournament, either. ``But no matter how bad you do, you always come
back.''
   Indeed, bowling badly at the championships is an annual
tradition, right up there with the march up the center aisle and
the crowning of Joe Bowler.
   Like today's bowling pins, bowlers are mighty resilient.
   ``Conditions are always rough,'' confirms Joe Ahler of Bay City,
Mich., whose 50th tournament appearance won him a diamond lapel pin
and warm applause when he marched up the aisle in April.
   The organist played ``Over the Rainbow.'' Ahler bowled 177.
   Like 60 percent of this year's bowlers, he's planning to try
again next year, when the tournament moves to Wichita, Kan.
   ``It's an impossible tournament,'' says Jim Wagner of Joliet,
Ill. ``But you keep wondering: When's your lucky year gonna come?''
   One of these days, Alice.
   One of these days.

<TEXT>
   It was only a matter of time before ``The
Dirty Dozen'' arrived as a weekly series.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. recently snatched it up, and a cast and
crew from MGM is busy re-creating this fantasy version of World War
II on location in Yugoslavia.
   It began as a hit movie in 1967 with an all-star cast, and NBC
revived it three times, once with Lee Marvin reprising his movie
role as the tough, good-guy leader, and twice with Telly Savalas,
who played a bad guy in the original movie, as the leader.
   It's a great concept. Take a bunch of convicted murders, offer
them an outside chance of freedom and send them off on a suicide
mission against the Nazis. The bad guys suddenly become the
underdogs and capture audience sympathy.
   Everybody's happy, except the Germans, who reportedly are a
little miffed at once again being the patsies in a war film.
   ``They're the classic underdogs,'' said executive producer John
Furia Jr. in a telephone interview from Zagreb, Yugoslavia.
``They've made mistakes of various kinds and are looking to redeem
themselves by heroic action.''
   Ben Murphy stars in the weekly series, which Fox began running
Saturdays last month. He plays Lt. Danko, the head of the group.
But this time he's also a convicted felon. Danko assaulted a
colonel he says was responsible for getting 80 of his men killed in
combat.
   ``Danko's a no-nonsense career soldier who doesn't want to be
there but doesn't know what else to do,'' said Murphy, also
speaking from Yugoslavia. ``It's sort of the story of my
experience. I've never done a series where life imitated art so
much. It's like going to war for a year. You leave home, go to
another country.
   ``Our accommodations are better than barracks, but the
filmmaking process is very much like being in the Army. You have
periods of hurry up and wait, then periods of intense work. I think
it's the toughest show on television in terms of man-hours,
hardships and the effort that goes into it.''
   Furia said Zagreb is like a big studio backlot because of its
old buildings, various architectural styles, cobbled streets and
variety of countryside just outside the city.
   ``There aren't many places left in Europe that still look like
the 1940s,'' said Furia. ``In addition, Yugoslavia has a lot of
equipment, military and otherwise, from the period. It's very
economical to shoot here. We have an excellent local film crew.
   ``Our shows are a combination of melodrama, action-adventure and
strong characters. We have a good cast and the luxury of being able
to tell many different kinds of stories within the framework of the
series. We've done stories on teen-age partisans, the Cossacks of
Eastern Europe and one that was supposed to be set on an island off
Scotland.''
   The show also stars John Slattery, Jon Tenney, John DiAquino and
John Bradley. That doesn't add up to a dozen, but various guest
actors are brought in for each episode. They're usually casualties
by the end of the show.
   ``Danko keeps a certain distance from his men, because of rank
and age, but there's also a comraderie,'' said Murphy. ``He's a
40-year-old lieutenant. I've been in four war movies, and in one 20
years ago I played a lieutenant. I've never gone beyond that in
rank. In `The Winds of War' I was a Navy lieutenant.''
   Murphy said he spends his off time playing tennis with his
Yugoslavian buddies. ``They have nice courts here,'' he said. ``We
found one the other day on an army base. My buddies talked our way
in. If I can play tennis a few times a week I have few problems
being anywhere.''
   Yugoslavia has become a major film site in recent years. The
sequel to ``The Great Escape'' was also filming there. ``War and
Remembrance'' had been there earlier. The movie ``High Road to
China'' and an NBC miniseries on Mussolini were also filmed there.
   ``They make a lot of World War II movies on their own,'' said
Furia. ``So they're used to our special effects bombs and the
machine guns. We're blowing up so many buildings and trucks I
sometimes think we're laying waste to half of Europe.''
   Furia is an old hand at working abroad. In recent years he's
produced ``Rage of Angels'' in France and Mexico, ``The Sun Also
Rises'' in Spain and France and ``We Are The Children'' in Kenya.
   ``Dirty Dozen: The Series'' began filming in Yugoslavia last
December and will not complete 13 episodes until July. It takes 10
days to make each episode.

<DATELINE>HONEYDEW, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the first weekend of every
month, thousands of art lovers take a walk on the wild side through
some of South Africa's loveliest farmland.
   It's the Crocodile Ramble, stretching 28 miles near Honeydew, a
village in the mink-and-manure belt, so called because of the
area's wealthy, horse-keeping inhabitants.
   Civil servants from government offices in Pretoria, businessmen
from Johannesburg and young families getting their first taste of
serious art walk and drive along dirt trails, through cow pastures
and bush. Artists and craftsmen open their workshops and chat with
all comers about form, color and price.
   Visitors who don't buy can still enjoy coffee, wine and light
lunches. Bands play. Hot-air balloons float overhead. Water
sportsmen head for Hartebeespoort Dam, a nearby lake. Enthusiasts
of early humans prowl among the caves at Sterkfontein, a few miles
away.
   Zulu tribesmen dance for tourists in a kraal of tree-branch
walls set up by a local hotel.
   Artists have lived for decades in the gentle hills around the
Crocodile River, their thatched houses secluded but still close to
showrooms in Johannesburg.
   The idea of the Ramble came a year ago to potter Tim Morris and
his wife, Marlene, who specializes in bonsai.
   ``Art should be accessible to everybody, including people who
are frightened of going into a gallery. Children should be
confronted with art,'' Morris said.
   ``The problem with this society is it's flush and it's plastic.
People are susceptible to easy forms of entertainment _ beer,
rugby, braais (cookouts) and video. It's essential that these
things are counterbalanced.''
   Morris encouraged some 25 friends to open their studios to the
public once a month, creating a vast attraction for both
connoisseurs and tourists.
   Property values soared. Jewelry-maker Debbie Scrimgeour bought
her farm for $90,000 just before the Ramble opened and said it's
now worth $170,000.
   Some artists, uncomfortable dealing with the public, dropped
out. Others welcomed their freedom from the demands of galleries,
which take up to 40 percent of selling prices, and found new
customers by taying home. Morris said he took in $2,500 on a recent
weekend.
   In a country where nearly all human endeavors are affected by
the prolonged conflict over apartheid, the Ramble remains a
non-political patch of Western taste set incongruously in the
African countryside. The artists and craftsmen are white, some born
in Europe. Some incorporate African themes in their work. Others,
such as Morris, draw on Northern Hemisphere traditions.
   The only studio devoted to black African art was hit by
lightning and burned down in February.
   The success of white farmers and artists masks poverty among
black seasonal farm workers, residents say. Scrimgeour said a 1987
survey by a local church listed 25 percent of black children under
6 years old as dangerously malnourished. She said the Ramble has
increased black employment.
   The Ramble includes Owen Wood, who charges up to $3,500 for his
hand-forged knives. Wood's wife, Sue, paints on silk. Muralist
Mickey Korzennik spent decades decorating corporate headquarters
before he lost a contract he had pursued for a year. The
disappointment made him rethink his life and his art.
   ``Now I stay here and do what I want, and let people respond,''
he said. His large wood and steel sculptures sell for up to $8,000.
   Henry Yatt, a furniture designer, and his wife, Fiona, an
interior decorator, opened a gallery of paintings by a friend,
Peter Nel, who died three years ago.
   ``We had about 60 of them and at first we didn't know what to
do,'' Yatt said. ``Now they're being sold and when they're all
gone, I'm not sure what will happen.''
   Sarie Saunders sells unglazed ceramic birds and plant holders
and small bronze animals at a farm that's been in her family for
100 years.
   Peter Worsley produces rustic furniture. ``I employed 52 people
in a two-story factory in Johannesburg,'' he said. ``Then a
customer brought me to the Crocodile River and I saw what I was
missing _ geese charging around the garden, dogs playing. I had
lost out on life.
   ``I sold my house and almost everything I had and bought a farm
here. I became a one-man business again, and have only 10 people
working for me now. Living since then has been total bliss.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Wide Musical Vocabulary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The songs on Thomas Dolby's new album bear
little resemblance to the synth-pop sound of his biggest hit, ``She
Blinded Me With Science,'' and that's just the way he wants it.
   Every song I've ever written has been different from every other
one,'' Dolby says. ``That's one of my rules of thumb. I like to
break ground with every song I write.''
   ``Aliens Ate My Buick'' is Dolby's third album. With music
ranging from reggae to pop to funk, he hopes no one will identify
him with a particular sound.
   ``That can be a terrible trap to fall into,'' he said. ``I am
very fortunate to have a wide musical vocabulary. I can use any
musical idiom to make a point.''
   Dolby, an Englishman who now lives in Los Angeles, calls himself
a satirist and relates to such musicians as Frank Zappa and George
Clinton, whose song ``Hot Sauce'' appears on ``Aliens.'' Dolby
pokes fun at men and women, at Americans and especially at himself.
   ``The songs are like `Tommy Goes to Hollywood,' a journal of an
Englishman who goes to America,'' he said in an interview.
   The first single is called ``Airhead.''
   ``The song is about one specific female from first-hand
experience,'' he said. ``The big crime is that the lady behaves
like an airhead even though she has a brain.''
   Dolby's concern about how women would feel about ``Airhead'' was
eased when a friend showed him some lyrics for a song called
``Bonehead.''
   ``It's about a guy who wears all the right clothes. I read them
and I was in fits of hysterics,'' Dolby said. ``It occurred to me,
`Do I feel insulted as a man by these lyrics?' No. They're not
about men, they're about a stereotype. It's making fun of the
stereotype.
   ``The only complaints I've had have been from men.''
   Dolby has worked with a number of artists, including Joni
Mitchell, Joan Armatrading, Foreigner and Def Leppard. He is
intrigued by the idea of producing a relatively new artist.
   ``I'd really like to take a raw talent like Terence Trent D'Arby
and mold him. He just doesn't have the experience to optimize his
talent,'' Dolby said. ``There are a lot of people who are at the
top of the strata who are good at optimizing the little talent they
have. I'd like to get the opposite side.''
   On the ``Aliens'' LP, actor Ed Asner's voice can be heard
shouting ``murder'' on ``My Brain Is Like a Sieve.'' Robin Leach,
the host of television's ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,''
introduces the album's first song, ``Key to Her Ferrari.''
   ``I was looking for a good attitude to begin the album,'' Dolby
said. ``He (Leach) has a production office in Los Angeles for
`Lifestyles' so I sent him a tape and he really liked the song.''
   ``Aliens'' was produced by Dolby and Bill Bittrell, who worked
on Michael Jackson's latest album, ``Bad.''
   ``They had a good dozen engineers working on that album,'' said
Dolby. ``Everybody said the most creative and sweetest to work with
was Bill Bittrell.''
   Dolby's first album, ``The Golden Age of Wireless,'' was
released in 1982 and included ``She Blinded Me With Science.''
Dolby toured in 1984 after the release of his second album, ``Flat
Earth,'' but had difficulty reproducing the sound from his studio
recordings. He does not anticipate that problem when he tours this
summer.
   ``The songs on this album lend themselves a lot more easily to
being performed live,'' he said. ``They're a lot more
groove-based.''
   Dolby will tour with the band he used on ``Aliens.'' Although
Los Angeles is famous for having big name session players, Dolby
auditioned unknown musicians to play on his new album.
   ``I was looking to find some people with enthusiasm. The LA
lifestyle is not conducive to challenging music,'' he said. ``There
are a lot of musicians who are technically proficient but don't
seem to do it with that much conviction.
   ``I was determined to turn up some fresh talent. I wanted people
who were good players but had some hunger.''
   The success of ``She Blinded Me With Science'' was helped
considerably by the accompanying video, which received heavy
airplay on Music Television. Dolby says he often writes with visual
images in mind.
   ``I'll have a picture in my head from a magazine or a book,
sometimes a scene from a movie,'' Dolby said. ``Sometimes I'm
already thinking ahead to the videos.''

<TEXT>
   As the new kid on the literary block, Michael
Chabon should have plenty of tips for aspiring writers after his
first novel earned him a record-breaking $155,000 advance.
   The 24-year-old Wunderkind doesn't have any words of wisdom,
though. Getting ``The Mysteries of Pittsburgh'' published was just
plain luck, he tells fledgling authors somewhat sheepishly. His
coming-of-age novel was actually his master's thesis.
   An unsuspecting Chabon turned it in last year to a professor at
the University of California at Irvine, who, instead of critiquing
the manuscript, sent it to his agent. The agent was impressed, as
was William Morrow & Co., which offered $155,000 for the hardcover
rights.
   Since its April release, ``The Mysteries of Pittsburgh'' has
jumped onto best-seller lists, with 130,000 hardback copies in
print. Foreign rights have been sold to editors in 13 countries and
bids for the paperback rights are in the six figures. A movie deal
also is in the works.
   The book is about a gangster's mild-mannered son who spends the
summer after college graduation with new, flashy friends, including
a young woman and man who vie for his affections. The protagonist,
like Chabon, attended the University of Pittsburgh, and the drama
unfolds in this city.
   ``To me, it's the first novel. It has all the weaknesses of
first novels. I mean, it's the first time I ever tried to write a
book,'' the slim, soft-spoken Chabon said on a recent visit here.
   The pricetag is irrelevant, he said, ``because it seems so
inflated to me. I just can't correlate it with the worth of the
book. All I ever really wanted was just to get my book published,
or get a book published.''
   Always an avid reader, Chabon decided while growing up in
Maryland he was going to become a writer. He honed his talents at
Pitt, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1984.
   After living in Paris six months, he applied to the two-year
writing program at Irvine. He began working on ``The Mysteries of
Pittsburgh'' in May 1985 in preparation for graduate school that
fall.
   ``I just thought ... there are going to be all these serious
writers there, real writers, and I'll bet they're all working on
novels and I've just been doing short stories,'' he recalled.
   By the time he arrived in Irvine, Chabon had written 100 pages,
80 of which he quickly scrapped. Over the next 1{ years, he spent
every evening working on the book, required for his master of fine
arts degree.
   He took his title from ``The Mysteries of Paris'' by
19th-century French novelist Eugene Sue. ``I substituted the word
Pittsburgh and I went, `Ooooh, neat,''' he said.
   Chabon finished the 297-page novel in February 1987 and, eager
for some feedback, dropped off the manuscript with novelist and
English professor Donald Heiney. Three days later, he was informed
a copy of his thesis was on its way to Heiney's agent in New York.
   ``It didn't look like student work. It had the look of
professional work,'' Heiney said.
   A month later, nine publishing houses took part in an auction
for the rights.
   Chabon is unimpressed and, in fact, feels downright
uncomfortable with all the praise.
   ``I like what I'm writing when I'm writing it and for about two
weeks thereafter. It has a very short half-life in my esteem,'' he
said, laughing. ``After that, I'm even assailed by intense doubts.
No amount of praise from other people can convince me of the worth
of what I've done.
   ``There's entire stretches of the novel that I can't read
without wincing. I say, `Ooooh, why did I say that? It's so
clumsy.'''
   Chabon has since sold several short stories to The New Yorker
and other magazines. He's working on a second novel as well as the
screenplay for ``The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,'' to be directed by
Alan J. Pakula of ``All the President's Men'' and ``Sophie's
Choice.''
   Despite his good fortune, Chabon has made few changes in the
quiet life he leads in Newport Beach, Calif., with his wife,
Lollie, 32, an English doctoral student and poet. Their splurges
include a new car, a color television and a honeymoon in Italy.
   ``Our strategy has been pretty much the same,'' he said. ``We
just basically pretend that it's not really happening.''
   Naturally, though, ``It's all real. And I'm just still me.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: `Junk Food Junkie' Stars on Radio Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Larry Groce says his
1976 novelty hit tune ``Junk Food Junkie'' was a prelude to some of
the music he has performed on his radio show, ``Mountain Stage.''
   The two-hour program, originating from the Capitol Plaza Theater
in Charleston, W.Va., is carried by about 125 National Public Radio
stations across the country.
   The show, similar to the defunct ``Prairie Home Companion,''
features an eclectic group of performers who sing country,
bluegrass, folk, blues, jazz and classical. Others recite poetry or
tell their favorite stories.
   Groce, as host of the show, has performed a routine in which he
intertwines the names of country music stars and song titles with
the names of classical music greats.
   He has introduced numbers such as George Friedrich Jones'
``Bourbon and Water Music,'' Waylon Wagner's ``Mommas Don't Let
Your Babies Grow Up to Be Valkyries'' and Johann Sebastian Bach
Owens' ``Branding Iron Concertos.''
   To sing some of them, he has assumed the identity of Plastico
Flamingo.
   Although the show focuses more on music than on humor, the
40-year-old Groce says ``Junk Food Junkie'' was similar to the
spoofs he has been doing on the program.
   ``It gave a preview of that,'' he said in an interview from his
rural home near Philippi, W.Va. ``I poked fun at organic food and
junk food eaters.
   ``I'm fairly knowledgeable about country music and sort of
knowledgeable about classical. I like to hit both targets. I've
done this in the past.''
   In ``Junk Food Junkie,'' which Groce wrote, he sang about eating
natural food such as yogurt by day and enjoying ``a genuine junk
food high'' at night. He rattled off a list of his favorite
munchies in a tune that caught the public fancy like few others.
   ``I had always admired satire and humor in songs,'' he recalled.
``I had written others like it _ satires of common, American
things. I felt this was a natural.
   ``I poked fun at myself, and I had no idea so many others fell
in the syndrome I do. The response was more than I thought it would
be. It got a lot of exposure in the press because of the odd nature
of the song.''
   He wrote the tune based on his experiences while working in an
organic restaurant in New York. ``After work, the cooks would go
out and get a hamburger,'' he said.
   The peculiarity of the song tended to stereotype him, he said.
   ``I like the song; it's clever and I'm not ashamed of it. But
they assume you're an oddball and can't sing. Actually my career
has been based on singing.''
   Since the hit, he has been the opening act on concert tours,
performed to smaller audiences in coffeehouses and worked in arts
programs.
   ``I did pretty much what anyone does who's not a big star,''
Groce said.
   Included in his work are a half-dozen albums for the Walt Disney
Co., including two volumes of ``Disney's Children's Favorites''
that sold 2 million each.
   ``They haven't made me famous but they are known quite a bit,''
he said.
   He's just completed a special for the Disney Channel on cable
TV, ``Larry Groce in Concert.''
   He's been doing ``Mountain Stage'' since 1984, first on West
Virginia Public Radio and then branching out coast-to-coast in July
1986.
   Groce says ``Mountain Stage'' stresses music more than ``Prairie
Home Companion,'' in which host Garrison Keillor touted his
fictional Minnesota town, Lake Wobegon.
   ``We do very different things,'' he said. ``We tend to feature
music and showcase the performers. They are the star of the show as
much as our regulars. Ours is a little more of a true variety show
where the guests take a bigger role. We give them much more time,
and our show is not so much anchored in me.''
   Guests have included bluegrass acts such as the Doug Dillard
Band from the ``Andy Griffith Show,'' comedy by Dr. Demento, poetry
by Allen Ginsberg, blues by Roy Bookbinder, country music by Kathy
Mattea, classical music by the Montani String Quartet and jazz by
the Bob Thompson Trio.
   ``This show takes chances and it's on the frontier of music in
certain ways,'' Groce said. ``We specialize in singers and writers
to a great degree. We don't tell them how to act, how to look or
what to sing. They appreciate that. There's no pretense. We just do
it.
   ``Our role is to get people who are trend setters, even though
they may not be well-known.''
   He still gets the inevitable question: What is your favorite
junk food these days?
   ``I stick with my old favorites like Dr. Pepper and Chee-tos. I
also am kind of addicted to peanut butter crackers. Actually,
anything with sugar in it,'' he said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Willow''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much has been written about how crucial ``Willow'' is to the
fortunes of its producers: MGM, attempting a comeback as a viable
film company; and George Lucas, still recovering from the bomb of
``Howard the Duck.''
   The box-office results aren't in yet, but both MGM and Lucasfilm
can be proud of their achievement. ``Willow'' is movie storytelling
in the grand tradition.
   No, it isn't a landmark film such as Lucas' ``Star Wars,'' the
kind of achievement that happens once a decade; much of ``Willow''
may seem familiar to audiences exposed to special effects movies of
recent years or to animated classics from Disney.
   But ``Willow'' stands on its own merits as high adventure
executed with superior imagination.
   The reluctant hero, Willow (Warwick Davis), is a young farmer
who dwells with his wife and two children in a village of little
people ``in a place that never existed, a time that never was.''
Willow finds a baby floating in a river, a very special baby who
will threaten the throne of the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh).
She orders her warriors to find and kill the baby.
   The village's High Aldwin (Billy Barty) assigns Willow to take
the baby to the good castle of Tir Asleen, and the perilous trek
begins. Willow encounters endless dangers, but he finds allies in
the over-the-hill warrior Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), a pair of
brownies (Kevin Pollak and Rick Overton), a good sorceress
(Patricia Hayes) and eventually the bad queen's daughter (Joanne
Walley).
   George Lucas provided the story of ``Willow,'' and Bob Dolman's
script reflects Lucas' penchant for highly developed fantasies. The
richness of detail contributes to credibility, as does Ron Howard's
straightforward direction. As an actor himself, Howard manages to
protect his performers from being overwhelmed by the special
effects.
   The resulting performances lend strength to ``Willow.'' Davis is
a natural, his compelling innocence providing the basic core of the
film. Kilmer has the whimsy and daredevil spirit of Errol Flynn,
and Walley could be his Olivia de Havilland, but with even more
spunk.
   Marsh is equally as fearsome as the queen in ``Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs,'' and veteran Barty is a commanding presence as
the leader of the little people.
   Only in the latter portions does the film falter. The storming
of the castle, complete with self-generating monsters, and the
climactic battle between the sorceresses could be trimmed.
   Nigel Wool produced ``Willow,'' with Lucas as executive
producer. The rating is PG, with much to scare small children.
Running time: 125 minutes.

   Looking for a different way to celebrate a
birthday or anniversary? Try ``VideoScrapbooks'' _ a line of
cassettes featuring the cultural highs and lows of bygone years.
   Using still photos, TV, film and newsreel footage, Halcyon Days
of New York has created videos for nostalgia junkies.
   The 1958 cassette shows Elvis in uniform and television ads for
that bold sound innovation, hi-fidelity stereo _ ``with you in the
middle.'' There are also gasps at space shots, fun with hula hoops,
Ed Sullivan and that legend in her own time, Barbie.
   The 1938 video has jitterbug marathons, Joe Louis, Fibber McGee
and Molly on radio and the Orson Welles joke of all time, ``The War
of the Worlds.''
   The VHS cassettes retail for $19.95 and feature the years 1958,
1948, 1938 and the 1920s.
   Meanwhile, for students and others in need of a little
``style,'' Paperback Visual Publishing has produced a video
adaptation of the Strunk and White English handbook, ``Elements of
Style.''
   The cassette, narrated by CBS newsman Charles Osgood, features a
color-coded screen to serve as index and to facilitate rewinding
and forwarding to specific chapters.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Overboard'' and ``The Couch Trip.''

   ``Overboard'' (CBS-Fox, VHS@Beta, $89.98, Rated PG)
   
   Take one insufferably rich, perpetually bored blonde, throw her
into the ocean, add a case of temporary amnesia and stir it up with
a hunky handyman bent on revenge, and you've got ``Overboard,'' a
charming comedy that looks better on tape than it sounds on paper.
   Goldie Hawn is Joanna Stayton, a ``Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous'' poster girl who changes bathing suits every 15 seconds and
gets her jollies by making other people miserable. Enter Dean
Proffitt, played by Hawn's real-life honey, Kurt Russell, a widowed
carpenter who comes aboard the Stayton yacht to remodel a closet.
   Joanna stiffs him and tosses his tools overboard. Later that
night, she falls overboard herself and emerges from the drink with
no idea of who she is. Seeing a chance to make her pay for her
nastiness, Dean convinces her she is his wife, Annie, mother of his
four no-neck monsters and keeper of the disaster area they call
home.
   The shock of real life almost kills her, and the transformation
from rich witch to human being is fun to watch, though predictable.
   Hawn, always at home with funny stuff, makes Joanna-Annie
alternately despicable and lovable, and Russell actually shows some
comedic flair in the hands of director Garry ``Happy Days''
Marshall.
   Clean enough for the kids, intelligent enough for the adults,
``Overboard'' is one of those warm, fuzzy little comedies
guaranteed to make the whole family feel good.

   ``The Couch Trip'' (Orion Home Video, VHS@Beta, $89.98, Rated R)
   
   ``The Couch Trip'' sets an enormous challenge for itself by
trying to be fresh and funny while using one of the most hackneyed
plot lines in the book: Psychiatrists are crazier than their
clients; mental patients are more madcap than mad, and often
possess, exclusively, truths of a very high ethical order; and said
patients appear crazy but it's really the rest of the world that's
lost its marbles.
   Dan Aykroyd stars as John Burns, a small-time criminal
institutionalized in a Chicago mental hospital where his specialty
is cheering up the other patients, making it with the receptionist
and driving the head shrink nuts.
   Meanwhile in Los Angeles, big-time radio shrink George Maitlin
(Charles Grodin) is having a breakdown _ that's what movie shrinks
do best _ because he's had an affair, or his wife has had one with
his best friend, or something like that. He wants to leave it all
behind for a sabbatical but he needs a replacement for his radio
program.
   Through some complicated machinations, Aykroyd schemes his way
out of the hospital, impersonates the head prison psychologist and
wins the spot as Maitlin's radio replacement, providing the film's
few hilarious moments.
   Along the way, Aykroyd's ruse is discovered by, who else?
another loonie, played by Walter Matthau. They have their little
quarrels but mostly seem to enjoy conversing in the higher-truth
patois of the Hollywood insane.
   Aykroyd's most ardent devotees may see something to like in
``The Couch Trip,'' but only if they don't mind the constant stream
of genital humor and four-letter words.

   Side 1 of the Pointer Sisters' latest album is awful _ dance
music as mindless and soulless as anything that surfaced in the
disco craze of the 1970s.
   The sisters redeem themselves a bit on the second side of
``Serious Slammin'.'' Still, it's hard to believe this is the same
group that turned out one of the decade's best pop records,
``Breakout,'' just five years ago.
   One problem with ``Serious Slammin''' is that June, Anita, Ruth
and producer Richard Perry haven't changed their formula a bit
since ``Breakout,'' and the sisters sound tired of it. They're
still singing uptempo dance tunes over synthesizers and drum
machines and, for a change of pace, mixing in steamy ballads over
synthesizers and drum machines.
   Another reason for the droopy energy level could be the
material, all provided by outside writers. The tunes are tuneless,
the lyrics lame. The nadir is ``Shut Up and Dance,'' which begins,
``All I want to do with you is dance; I don't need no verbal
expose.'' There must have been something else the Pointer Sisters
could have recorded instead.
   When the songs are decent, so is ``Serious Slammin'.''
   ``My Life,'' which opens Side 2, is the first cut that creates
any kind of rhythmic momentum. The mid-tempo ``I Will Be There,''
which closes the record, deserves a place alongside such past hits
by the group as ``Slowhand'' and ``Fire.'' Alas, most of ``Serious
Slammin''' is pointless, sisters.

   ``That Special Part of Me'' (MCA) _ Onaje Allan Gumbs
   
   Onaje Allan Gumbs is unknown despite the company he keeps. The
veteran producer, composer and pianist has worked with such jazz
artists as Woody Shaw, Nat Adderley, Stanley Jordan and Billy
Cobham, but ``That Special Part of Me'' is his first album in more
than a decade.
   Much of the record is terrific. Jazz is the common thread,
although there are also elements of pop and rhythm & blues. Gumbs
writes melodies that give his instrumentals instant appeal, and yet
the improvisations _ particularly by Gumbs on piano _ are intricate
and reward listeners who play the record through more than once.
   There are few frills but plenty of variety in the arrangements.
``Shadowlight'' features a trio and gives Gumbs a chance to
stretch; the Keith Jarrett-like ``The Dancer'' is Gumbs playing one
grand piano part overdubbed on another.
   The R & B influence comes into play on the title cut and ``Quiet
Passion,'' which find a groove and stay there.
   The pop element, however, is incorporated with less success.
Gumbs makes Muzak with his cover of ``Didn't I Blow Your Mind (This
Time),'' while ``All My Love (For You),'' the only tune featuring
vocals, unfortunately sounds like a duet between Dionne Warwick and
Donnie Osmond.
   Aside from the two awry crossover ventures, ``That Special Part
of Me'' represents a welcome and successful try by Gumbs for a
higher profile.

<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In October 1986, the Paramount publicity
department needed a hard sell to persuade journalists to interview
an Australian pitchman-turned-actor named Paul Hogan. No problem
now.
   What made the difference was ```Crocodile' Dundee,'' a surprise
blockbuster that grossed $175 million in the United States and
Canada and did comparable business wherever it played. Now Hogan's
back with ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' which he swears will be the
end of the outback adventurer.
   ``I've completed the circle,'' he said. ``The new one is a good
movie; it stands up all by itself. It's the end of `Crocodile'
Dundee.
   ``Yes, I'm sure I'll be asked the same questions in three years
and five years. Like, `What if 10 million people write you and say
they want to see more?' That's getting a bit unfair.
   ``The challenge now is to come up with another character that
surpasses `Crocodile' Dundee. That doesn't mean I'll start playing
`The Hunchback of Czechoslovakia.' I won't stretch credibility too
far.''
   His remarks will be filed for future reference. Remember when
Sean Connery said no more James Bond? Remember ``Never Say Never
Again''?
   If the success of ```Crocodile' Dundee'' has changed Paul Hogan,
it's not visible. He remains the same wry, laid-back observer of
the passing scene.
   Can he really be just plain Paul Hogan any more?
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``In my home I can. I'm there as often as
possible. When I work, I work seven days a week, however long it
takes. When I finish the job, I disappear off the planet. Then I
become bored with myself very quickly, and I go back.''
   About the only places where he can now travel freely, he
admitted, are the Soviet Union and China: ``Six months from now it
may be different. But I don't really want to go to Russia anyway.''
   Hogan recently talked about the origins of ```Crocodile' II.''
   ``I decided about the time I finished No. 1,'' he said. ``In the
back of my head I thought I'd like to see this go further. I'd like
to see this character get in real trouble. The first one was mostly
a small-brackets adventure, a comedy and a love story with a little
adventure.
   ``I thought I'd like to do a high adventure _ if I could make it
better than the first one.''
   In the new film, Dundee's girlfriend (Linda Kozlowski) becomes
the target of South American drug dealers. After escaping death
attempts in New York, the pair flee to the Australian outback. The
villains pursue them, and Dundee faces seemingly insuperable odds.
   The script was written by Hogan and his oldest son, Brett. Hogan
said they made a good combination: ``We were like a team writing
songs _ one writing the lyrics and the other the music. He writes
very much in story lines, and I write in scenes.''
   The Paul Hogan story is the kind that makes the film business
ever so fascinating. Who could figure that an Australian TV
comedian would become an international star with one movie? Hogan
didn't even start out to be an entertainer. He was making $75 a
week as a workman on Sydney's Harbour Bridge in 1972 when a buddy
dared him to appear on the Down Under version of ``The Gong Show.''
   The object of ``New Faces'' was to humiliate the contestants.
Hogan ``turned the tables and ripped them to pieces. People all
over the country loved seeing me get revenge. I was an overnight
sensation.''
   Soon he became partners with John Cornell (who directed ``Dundee
II'') in ``The Paul Hogan Show,'' which drew high ratings and was
syndicated in the United States and 30 other countries.
   Hogan became a familiar face here with his commercials for
Australian beer and tourism. So many visitors came to Australia
that facilities were overtaxed. Hogan is no longer pitching his
native land: ``We don't want tourists sleeping in tents,'' he said.
   A visit to New York in 1984 planted the seed for ```Crocodile'
Dundee.'' Fishing with friends in the Northern Territory, Hogan
mused about what would happen if his fellow fishermen were
transported to Manhattan _ ``they would really think they're on
another planet.''
   Hogan and Cornell raised the $5.6 million to finance the movie.
It became Australia's biggest grosser, and Paramount bought the
U.S. rights and 20th Century Fox the rest of the world.
   Before the American opening, Hogan suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage while weightlifting. He quickly recovered and has had no
recurrence. ``It was just one of those things that come along to
remind you that you're not Superman,'' he said.
   Paul and Noelene Hogan, who married in 1958, divorced in 1981
and remarried a year later, have five children and have become
grandparents. He was asked if he receives more respect at home
since ```Crocodile' Dundee.''
   ``I'm still the head of the house, by sufferance,'' he replied.
``I don't get any special privilege. I still can't turn off the
television set and sit in front of everybody and tell them about my
day. `Aw, shut up, Dad,' they say. `It's boring, get out of the
way.'''

<HEAD>National Sharing of `Cadillac Kidneys' Gets Mixed Reviews</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The first time Louise Adams entered a Houston hospital for a
kidney transplant, the donated organ ended up being sent halfway
across the country.
   A week later, it happened again. The kidney, her ticket to a
dialysis-free life, was shipped a thousand miles away at the last
minute.
   ``I'm sure the person who got it is very deserving, but it's
still very disappointing,'' said the 57-year-old Houston woman.
``You find yourself feeling guilty about your feelings because I
thought, `Well, I wouldn't feel quite so badly if it had stayed in
Houston. But to ship it out...'''
   She knew she was competing not only with local patients but also
with those waiting and praying, just like her, around the country.
   One of those waiting and praying was Denise Warren, 27, of
Jordan, Minn., who got the second kidney thanks to new national
guidelines designed to make transplantation more efficient and
equitable.
   ``I'm just happy it happened,'' Ms. Warren said. ``I was
prepared to be on dialysis for a while. I didn't think I'd get one
for a long time.''
   Because of an unsuccessful kidney transplant March 16, 1986, two
years to the day before her latest operation, Denise Warren's
immune system had built up an unusually large number of antibodies.
Her best hope was a perfectly matched kidney, a rare and therefore
prized possession.
   When such an organ became available in Houston in mid-March, the
Gulf Coast Independent Organ Procurement Organization was forced to
relinquish it under the new rules. After a computerized search by
the United Network for Organ Sharing, Ms. Warren was found to be
the best candidate.
   And Louise Adams was sent home, once more, to wait. Her wait
ended May 20, when she received a new kidney at Hermann Hospital in
Houston.
   That's the way it goes under the 8-month-old program, which
requires America's 201 kidney transplant centers and 120 organ
procurement agencies to share all ``six-antigen'' kidneys.
   Antigens, simply, are features of alien organisms or tissue that
can provoke an attack by the immune system. If antigens of a
transplanted organ match those of the recipient's body, the immune
system usually does not attack. The six-antigen organs, only 2.6
percent of all donated kidneys, had been snapped up where they were
procured until the new rules were implemented.
   ``The nurses and doctors say it's a fair system,'' said Ms.
Adams. ``Of course, I can only believe what they tell me.''
   The kidney-sharing policy was adopted last summer by the
31-member board of directors of UNOS and implemented Oct. 1.
   The Virginia-based computer center operates the Organ
Procurement Transplantation Network, to which all transplant
centers must belong to receive Medicare reimbursements. The network
was recommended by the National Task Force on Organ
Transplantation, formed under the 1984 National Transplant Act.
   UNOS also instituted a standardized scoring system for
distributing other increasingly scarce organs, like hearts, livers
and lungs. Patients are awarded points based on medical urgency,
length of time on the waiting list and proximity to the donor,
among other things.
   ``It's a great improvement over what existed before, which was a
mish-mash of politics and old-boy networks,'' said Arthur Caplan,
director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of
Minnesota.
   More than 13,550 people are awaiting organ transplants in the
United States, 12,200 of whom need new kidneys, according to Arthur
Harrell of the American Council on Transplantation. Virtually all
of the kidney transplant candidates are on dialysis, the
exhausting, week-after-week mechanical elimination of impurities
from the blood.
   To increase the number of nationally shared kidneys and help
more hard-to-match, sensitized patients like Ms. Warren, the
network in March expanded the guidelines to cover certain kidneys
with fewer than six identified or detected antigens. Failure to
comply with any of the guidelines could result in suspension or
expulsion from the network, and loss of Medicare funding.
   Gene Pierce, executive director of UNOS, expects the change to
double the number of perfectly matched kidneys UNOS offers. There
were 115 organ donors reported to UNOS from Oct. 1, 1987, to April
30 who matched a potential kidney recipient for all six antigens.
Not all were transplanted, for various reasons.
   Whether it's sharing kidneys or assigning points, the transplant
surgeon still has the final say, according to Dr. John McDonald,
president of UNOS and of the American Society of Transplant
Surgeons. ``The physician has the option of using his best medical
judgment. Now he has to defend that.''
   The guidelines have not ``changed what they (centers) have been
doing in terms of getting the right organ to the right patient,
because they were doing that anyway,'' he said. ``But it has
reduced that process to a written policy which they are able to
follow and defend and argue about.''
   Reaction has been mixed, and McDonald said, ``One cannot have a
national organization of this type with everybody being perfectly
happy about it. There is no organized group out there that is in
opposition. No rebellion is going on. No centers have refused to
participate and abide by these guidelines.''
   Mandatory kidney sharing has produced the most grumbling.
   Some experts maintain that the long-term success of kidney
transplants depends on careful matching of the donor and recipient.
Others argue that does not justify flying kidneys all over the
country since the more they are moved and the longer they go
unused, the less viable they become.
   Donated kidneys can be preserved outside the body for up to 48
hours, four times longer than livers and nearly 10 times longer
than hearts.
   ``Obviously, some people are a little upset when they have to
send them out. They could have used them locally just as well,''
Pierce said. ``We keep trying to remind them that when you give,
you get back. If everyone is cooperating, and they must, then there
will be a fair distribution.''
   Brian Broznick, executive director of the Pittsburgh Transplant
Foundation, winces every time he sends a ``Cadillac kidney'' out of
town. ``I do this job because I want to see people transplanted.
Period. But I'm a Pittsburgher. I'm very proud of the program here.
I want to see this program work. I don't want to see my kidneys go
to waste or share them with everybody.''
   Mary Jane LaCombe, transplant coordinator for the Hennepin
County Medical Center in Minneapolis, is ahead of the game. As of
early May, she had given up one prized kidney but got back three,
one of which went to Ms. Warren.
   Broznick had shipped out two perfect kidneys, but got only one
back.
   In Houston, four went out but none came in. ``We provided four
people with kidneys and a chance they might not have otherwise
had,'' said Rebecca Davis, executive director of Gulf Coast. ``On
the other hand, it just so happens that twice the same patient (Ms.
Adams) was asked to come in for the potential transplant and twice
told, `I'm sorry, we have to ship these kidneys out.'
   ``It's a very difficult, very touchy issue. But if you look in
the global viewpoint, we're probably doing what is correct.''

<TEXT>
   The National Organ Transplant Act was passed by Congress in 1984
in response to the growing need for a national transplant system
and medical and ethical guidelines. It called for formation of a
National Task Force on Organ Transplantation and mandated
establishment of a national Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network to be administered by a private group with oversight of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It provided grants to
organ procurement groups to help increase their effectiveness and
promote organ donation. It also called for establishment of a
registry of recipients.

<BYLINE>National Task Force on Organ Transplantation</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Task Force on Organ Transplantation is a 25-member
panel that made 70 recommendations to Congress and to the secretary
of Health and Human Services in 1986. The panel of doctors and
experts, which no longer exists, recommended:
   _That hearts and livers go to Americans whenever possible and
that foreigners make up no more than 10 percent of the total kidney
recipients at any transplant center.
   _A ban on the exportation of donor organs, except when no
appropriate recipients can be found in the United States.
   _That all states pass laws under which hospitals would be
required to approach families about the possibility of organ
donation.
   _That a federal entity be established for organ transplantation.
That entity is the Division of Organ Transplantation, part of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

   UNOS is a non-profit organization based in Richmond, Va., that
was given a federal contract in 1986 to set up the national Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network, which links by computer
all U.S. transplant centers, organ procurement agencies and
tissue-typing laboratories. Membership is mandatory in order for
these institutions to receive federal Medicare reimbursements.
   UNOS' 31-member board in 1987 approved mandatory guidelines for

<HEAD>Forecasters Are Getting Better _ But Not Very Quickly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beach days still turn to deluge with no regard for
forecasters' promises, but the tricky art of predicting the weather
is actually getting better.
   How much better? So accurate, according to one official, that
people are starting to believe them.
   ``It's my impression that there is much more reliance on weather
forecasts today,'' says H. Robert Glahn. ``People will use them,
whereas 20 years ago, they probably wouldn't.''
   There are many statistical ways of interpreting forecasters'
track records, says Glahn, chief of the National Weather Service's
Technologies Development Laboratory in Silver Spring, Md. But in
general, studies show that ``a 48-hour forecast now is almost as
accurate as a 24-hour forecast was 20 years ago.''
   According to the weather service's way of keeping time, a
24-hour forecast is this morning's prediction of what it will do
this afternoon. A 48-hour forecast is today's prediction of what
will happen tomorrow.
   Another example of the improvement, says Glahn, is forecasters'
growing avoidance of big errors. Last winter, there was a 6 percent
chance the weather service would be off 10 degrees or more on
tomorrow's temperature. Twenty years ago, there was a 13 percent
chance.
   Other ways of looking at forecasters' prowess produce numbers
that aren't quite so impressive.
   Frederick Sanders, a meteorologist who retired four years ago
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, notes that it isn'~enough
to be right most of the time. Anybody can do that.
   In Boston, for example, it rains one day in three, so a daily
forecast of ``no rain'' will be right 67 percent of the time. In
Yuma, Ariz., it rains just seven days a year, making the same
forecast right 98 percent of the time.
   So Sanders and others who keep track of such things compare the
forecast to the average weather, what's known as the climatological
norm.
   In Boston, forecasters give the correct next-day forecast about
82 percent of the time _ halfway between 67 percent, which requires
no skill, and 100 percent. So the forecasters are said to have a 50
percent skill level.
   From 1966 until he retired, Sanders and his students predicted
the Boston weather every day. Their accuracy was a little better
than the weather service. And over time, he found that their skill
improved about 5 percent a decade.
   A similar analysis by Allan H. Murphy at Oregon State University
found that the weather service is improving 5-10 percent a decade.
   Forecasters attribute most of the improvement to computers,
which let them create three-dimensional pictures of the atmosphere.
Using complex formulas, they fast-forward the weather to create an
image of the winds, pressures, temperatures and moisture in
tomorrow's skies.
   ``I think the improvement in the future will be a little greater
than it has been,'' says Tzvi Gal-Chen of the University of
Oklahoma. ``I'm not willing to bet my house on it, but maybe my
car. I have a very old car.''
   Sanders foresees no breakthroughs in forecasting precision. But
he quickly adds that his prediction probably doesn't mean much.
   ``Big breakthroughs are always unexpected,'' he says. ``That's
one of the interesting things about fishing and science.''

<HEAD>Experts Predict Increase in Lyme Disease Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Allen Steere is making his spring rounds,
spreading the word that tourists wearing shorts and sandals are
easy prey for ticks carrying the disease he identified.
   Steere speaks about Lyme disease not only as the doctor who
first classified the infection 13 years ago but also as a parent
whose son caught it despite his father's expertise and caution.
   ``As this disease spreads into areas where it has not been
before, it becomes even a more difficult problem to deal with,''
said Steere, director of the Lyme disease clinic at the New England
Medical Center.
   He was working at Yale University when he discovered the disease
and named it for Lyme, Conn., where he identified it in a group of
children. Cases have been confirmed in 33 states, Europe, Asia,
Australia and New Zealand.
   To detail the rapid spread of the disease, Steere tells of his
son, who caught Lyme disease in 1983 despite daily tick checks.
They lived then in North Branford, Conn., 30 miles from Lyme.
   ``When I first arrived in Connecticut, it was only in the
southeast corner of the state,'' he said in a telephone interview
from Martha's Vineyard, where he was briefing local health
officials. ``Just during the time I was there we saw the tick
spread into our community and it hasn't stopped.''
   The disease is transmitted by the bite of a pinhead-sized deer
tick, but the real culprit is Borrelia burgdorferi, a spiral-shaped
bacteria. Populations of infected ticks have been found along the
Northeast coast from Maine to Maryland, and in Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Oregon and California.
   Early signs of Lyme disease include flu-like symptoms and a
circular rash that expands from the bite. Patients given
antibiotics early generally are cured without lasting effects. If
untreated, 60 percent of patients develop arthritis-like symptoms.
Other possible complications include hepatitis, respiratory
distress and damage to the heart and central nervous system.
   Fifteen-hundred cases are reported in the United States each
year, but Steere and Dr. Andrew Spielman of the Harvard School of
Public Health said many go unreported because victims believe they
have other ailments.
   Some scientists predict an increase in the number of cases this
year because of a growing deer population and an accompanying rise
in the number of deer ticks.
   The majority of tick bites occur from mid-May through July, and
most victims report having been in or near a woods with a deer
population. Although the ticks that carry the ailment live on deer
in their adult stages, Lyme disease is transmitted by bites from
immature ticks, which feed primarily on mice.
   The immature ticks bite humans at ``mouse-belly height,''
placing people with exposed feet and legs at highest risk, Spielman
said. ``That means a good thing to do when in an area of high risk
is to wear light-colored trousers and tuck the cuffs into your
stockings. You need to check your pants frequently and carefully,
because the ticks are very small, about the size of a poppy seed.''
   Those bitten are unlikely to contract the disease if the tick is
removed with tweezers within 24 hours of the bite.
   A Boston company Spielman is associated with, EcoHealth, is
marketing ``Damminix,'' small tubes filled with cotton treated with
a chemical that kills the ticks. Mice carry the cotton to their
nests, where the immature ticks live. The chemical is available in
a clothing spray but doesn't have federal approval and is licensed
in only a few states, Spielman said.

   The first time Louise Adams entered a Houston hospital for a
kidney transplant, the donated organ ended up being sent halfway
across the country. A week later, it happened again.
   Ms. Adams, 57, knew that under new national guidelines designed
to make transplantation more efficient and equitable she was
competing not only with local patients but also with many of the
more than 12,200 people awaiting kidney transplants in the United
States.
   When a perfectly matched kidney _ only 2.6 percent of all
donated kidneys _ became available in Houston in mid-March the Gulf
Coast Independent Organ Procurement Organization had to relinquish
it under the new rules. A computer search by the United Network for
Organ Sharing found that instead of Ms. Adams, the best candidate
was Denise Warren, 27, of Jordan, Minn.
   The kidney-sharing policy was adopted last summer by UNOS and
implemented Oct. 1. UNOS operates the Organ Procurement

belong to get Medicare reimbursements. The network was recommended

   Since Steere, director of the Lyme disease clinic at New England
Medical Center, classified it 13 years ago after an outbreak in
Lyme, Conn., cases have been confirmed in 33 states, Europe, Asia,
Australia and New Zealand.
   Lyme disease is transmitted by a tiny deer tick, but the real
culprit is a bacteria. Infected ticks have been found in wooded
areas from Maine to Maryland and in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oregon
and California.
   Tick bites mainly occur from mid-May through July, but those
bitten are unlikely to contract the disease if the tick is removed
with tweezers within 24 hours of the bite. Early signs include a
circular rash and flu-like symptoms. Patients given antibiotics
early generally are cured without lasting effects.
   If untreated, 60 percent of patients develop arthritis-like
symptoms. Complications can include hepatitis, breathing trouble
and damage to the heart and nervous system.
   The ticks bite humans at ``mouse-belly height,'' putting people
with exposed feet and legs at highest risk, said Dr. Andrew
Spielman of the Harvard School of Public Health. In high-risk
areas, people should wear light-colored pants, making the tick
easier to see, and tuck the cuffs into socks.
   Fifteen-hundred U.S. cases are reported each year, but Steere
and Spielman said many go unreported because victims believe they
have other ailments. Scientists predict more Lyme disease cases
this year because of an increase in the deer population and a
corresponding rise in the number of deer ticks.

   Satellite information and computer models have
improved weather forecasts so much that people are even starting to
believe them.
   There are many ways to interpret track records, says H. Robert
Glahn, chief of the National Weather Service Technologies
Development Laboratory in Silver Spring, Md. But in general,
studies show that ``a 48-hour forecast now is almost as accurate as
a 24-hour forecast was 20 years ago.''
   A 24-hour forecast is this morning's prediction of what it will
do this afternoon. A 48-hour forecast is today's prediction of
tomorrow's weather.
   Another improvement, says Glahn, is avoiding big errors. Last
winter, there was a 6 percent chance the weather service would be
off 10 degrees or more on tomorrow's temperature. Twenty years ago,
there was a 13 percent chance.

<HEAD>Drug Appears Effective Against Excess Platelets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug appears to reduce the number of blood
platelets in people who have potentially hazardous high levels of
the clot-forming cells.
   Too many platelets, a relatively rare condition known is
thrombocytosis, can lead to unwanted blood clots that cause heart
attacks and strokes. Like too few platelets, too many can also
cause excessive bleeding. Thrombocytosis may also result from other
diseases, such as leukemia.
   The drug, anagrelide, returned platelet levels to normal in 20
patients without harming other kinds of blood cells.
   A report on the research, directed by Dr. Murray N. Silverstein
of the Mayo Clinic, was published in a recent New England Journal
of Medicine. In their report, the doctors concluded the new drug
``appears promising.''
   In an accompanying editorial, however, Dr. John W. Adamson of
the University of Washington in Seattle warned that more study was
needed: ``Does anagrelide really represent an advance? The answer
is unclear.''

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trio of astronomers is studying dwarf
galaxies darker than the night sky in hopes of explaining why
researchers have been able to see less than 10 percent of the
universe through telescopes.
   Astronomers believe the mass is there because of its
gravitational influence and the motion of star systems, and explain
it with theories that include subatomic particles called neutrinos,
and brown dwarfs larger than planets but too small to shine like
stars.
   Christopher Impey of the University of Arizona favors a
dim-galaxy theory.
   Dwarf galaxies are dim because their stars are much farther
apart than stars in the Milky Way, Impey says. In the newly charted
Virgo galaxies, stars are 50 to 100 times farther apart than in our
own, yet they contain a billion stars or more. While their total
light output is substantial, the starlight is distributed so
diffusely that no part of the galaxy is brighter than the sky.
   Impey, David Malin of the Anglo-Australian Observatory at Siding
Spring, Australia, and Greg Bothun at the University of Michigan
have found only the brightest faint dwarfs, but even so they've
found at least 100 times as many faint-dwarf galaxies as brighter
ones in Virgo, Impey said.
   In the research, Malin searches with the 48-inch, wide-view
United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring, Impey uses the
larger optical telescopes of Arizona's Steward Observatory to study
the properties of the galaxy, and finally Bothun looks with a radio
telescope. Their findings will be published in July in the
Astrophysical Journal.

<HEAD>Scientists Track Power Plant Emissions Into Ocean Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are sweeping the sea floor from
Chesapeake Bay to Cape Hatteras to find out whether millions of
pounds of potentially harmful metal particles from coastal power
plants are getting into the food we eat.
   ``The question is, where do they go?'' says Leonard Pietrafesa,
a North Carolina State University oceanographer. ``Are they lying
dormant somewhere, or are they being eaten by critters higher and
higher up in the food chain?''
   In a four-year, $4 million federal study begun in February,
Pietrafesa and scientists at Yale, Columbia, the University of
South Florida, Old Dominion and Brookhaven National Laboratory are
collecting sediment, plants, fish and other samples.
   They hope to learn if heavy metals from 20 nuclear and 40
fossil-fuel power plants in New York, New Jersey and Delaware cling
to microscopic sea life on the shelf extending 60 miles from shore,
where most East Coast seafood is caught, says Pierre Biscaye, a
Columbia University marine geochemist.
   The plants annually release 20 million pounds of metals such as
mercury, lead, copper and cadmium that can harm humans in large
doses, says Pietrafesa. If the study proves that power-plant
byproducts remain on the shelf floor, the government may propose
stiffer regulations, says Helen McCammon, director of the DOE's
Ecological Research Division. ``If the nation is dumping in the
ocean, we want to know what's happening to them ...
   ``Are energy problems going to come back to haunt us?''

<HEAD>Mars Makes Closest Approach to Earth in a Generation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sky-watchers disappointed by the comets Halley and
Kohoutek, don't give up: This is the year of ``a great Martian
adventure.''
   Mars in September makes its closest approach to Earth in a
generation _ just over 36 million miles, and at its nearest on
Sept. 21 the red planet will rival Jupiter as the brightest object
in the sky after the moon and Venus.
   ``It won't be this close again until 2003,'' says Jack
Horkheimer, the ``Star Hustler'' of the Public Broadcasting System
and executive director of Miami's Space Transit Planetarium. ``And
there are a lot of kids out there who have never seen it this
bright.''
   Unlike Halley and Kohoutek, Mars's brightness is more
predictable and it will be visible from almost everywhere in the
world. ``I see 1988 as a great Martian adventure,'' says
Horkheimer. ``I'm like a kid in a candy store.''
   Earth passes Mars every two years, but only every 15 to 17 years
do they come this close. The year began with Earth and Mars 200
million miles apart.
   The unblinking reddish-orange light is expected to spark UFO
sightings, Horkheimer says, and as if to show the heavens have a
sense of humor, the peak of the show is weeks shy of the 50th
anniversary of Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast that
panicked the nation with fictional invaders from Mars.

<TEXT>
   A freeze-drying process that creates undamaged
tissue specimens for microscopic analysis is under study as a way
for eye banks to store human corneas indefinitely for transplant.
   LifeCell Corp. researchers have used the process developed at
the University of Texas Health Science Center to store baboon and
rabbit corneas a month before reattaching them, said Jake Requard
of Tissue Banks International, a non-profit network of 11 eye and
tissue banks.
   TBI has awarded a $15,000 grant to Dr. John D. Gottsch, a cornea
specialist at The Wilmer Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital who
will assess the process' value in humans. Corneas now are viable up
to about seven days.
   In the LifeCell process, a sample is cooled so rapidly _ using a
liquid nitrogen-chilled copper bar at minus 196 dugrees Centrigrade
_ that it bypasses the phase when ice crystals form, said Paul
Frison, LifeCell Inc. president. It then is transferred to a
molecular distillation dryer, which evaporates most of the water
and returns the sample to room temperature, saving laboratories the
cost of refrigerated storage.
   Current chemical processes alter the proteins, enzymes and
genetic components of tissue, freezing produces ice crystals that
harm cell structures, and use of dimethyl sulfoxide to reduce ice
damage alters cells, Frison said.
   LifeCell, of The Woodlands, Texas, is a profit-making enterprise
set up in 1986 to market technology developed at the Houston health
center. Investors include Allstate Insurance Co. Venture Capital
Division, First Boston Corp. of New York, and Tenneco Ventures of
Houston.

   The dollar dipped in thin, trendless European
trading early today, with exchange dealers predicting a quiet
session because of the closure of many European markets for a
religious holiday. Gold firmed in London.
   ``The dollar only seems to move once a month now,'' said one
trader in Milan, referring to the midmonthly release of the U.S.
trade figures.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar edged down 0.02 yen to a closing 124.80. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 124.78 yen.
   ``With no specific market-moving incentives at hand, the dollar
remains in a narrow range,'' said an exchange dealer at a major
commercial bank in Tokyo.
   He said market participants were trying to keep the U.S.
currency at a low 124-yen level.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday,
were: 1.7020 West German marks, down from 1.7030; 1.4180 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4195; 5.7520 French francs, down from 5.7560;

<HEAD>American Stores To Acquire Lucky For $2.5 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In winning an agreement to acquire Lucky Stores
Inc., American Stores Co. is gaining a supermarket company given
high marks for its management and marketing ability.
   Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, has agreed
to be acquired by American, the third-largest, in a buyout valued
at about $2.5 billion cash, or $65 a share.
   The merger would create the nation's biggest grocery store chain.
   The agreement announced Friday terminated Lucky's April 28 deal
to go private in a leveraged buyout led by the New York firm
Gibbons, Green van Amerongen Ltd. for $2.35 billion in cash and
stock.
   It also gives American Stores, based in Salt Lake City, a chance
to take advantage of the management expertise and longstanding
identity as a low-price leader that analysts say have been among
Lucky's most valuable assets.
   ``American Stores has always considered Lucky to be the leading
supermarket chain in California and is enthusiastic about the
combination of our Alpha Beta (grocery store) operations with those
of Lucky,'' American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs said in announcing
the buyout.
   Analysts widely had speculated that if American Stores succeeded
in acquiring Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky, it would merge the company
with its weaker Alpha Beta chain in California.
   Lucky Stores has 480 stores and had $6.4 billion in 1987 sales.
American Stores has 1,600 stores and $14.1 billion in sales.
   Lucky also was seen as a desirable takeover target because of a
restructuring prompted by an unsuccessful takeover attempt last
year by New York investor Asher B. Edelman.
   The company sold off its non-grocery divisions, plus stores in
Arizona and Florida under the restructuring, and paid $2.8 million
of Edelman's legal costs in return for his dropping the hostile bid.
   While the $65 a share price being paid for Lucky was considered
high by some analysts, American Stores might justify the cost
through the efficiencies of combined operations, industry experts
said.
   To break off its buyout agreement with Gibbons, Green, Lucky
Stores agreed to pay the firm a $20 million fee plus expenses.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lucky
closed unchanged at $64.37{ Friday while American Stores fell $1 to
$53.25.
   The offer from American Stores is subject to a majority of
Lucky's 38.6 million shares being tendered. American Stores said it
had written commitments from commercial banks for all financing
required.
   The American Stores offer expires at midnight EDT June 1.
   Lucky shares not purchased by American Stores in the tender
offer will be converted into the right to receive $65 in cash in a
subsequent merger between Lucky and a subsidiary of American.
   American Stores had raised its bid for Lucky to $65 a share last
Tuesday.
   Gibbons, Green's latest offer was for a leveraged buyout that
would pay $61 a share in cash for about 92 percent of Lucky's
outstanding shares. Gibbons, Green would also have issued preferred
shares valued at $7 a share for the remaining shares.
   American Stores' second bid followed the disclosure of
confidential information by Lucky to American, under the
stipulation that American would either sweeten its offer or end its
hostile bid.
   American Stores initiated the bidding with a $45-a-share tender
offer that Lucky rejected as inadeauate in March, as it did a later
offer of a negotiated acquisition at $50 a share.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it will extend for three
more months a freeze on wages and the prices of federally regulated
goods and services as part of its battle against inflation.
   President Miguel de la Madrid decided to hold wages, prices and
the peso-dollar exchange rate steady until the end of August, the
government news agency Notimex reported Sunday.
   ``We will not be able to sing victory in the fight against
inflation until (the rate) gets to comparable levels with the
trading partners of our country and ... stays (at that rate) for
several months,'' the news agency quoted de la Madrid as saying.
   De la Madrid unveiled the program, called the Economic
Solidarity Pact, in December in an effort to bring under control
the nation's skyrocketing inflation rate. Consumer prices soared a
record 159.2 percent in all of last year.
   When the program was announced, government officials said its
goal was to reduce the monthly inflation rate to 2 percent to 3
percent by year's end.
   But the government reported earlier this month that consumer
prices rose 3.1 percent in April, well under the record 15.5
percent posted in January.
   Budget Secretary Pedro Aspe said last week that May's inflation
pace may run about 2 percent.
   The economic program, as initially drafted, called for the
monthly indexing of wages and prices. But administration officials
quickly turned the plan into a quasi-shock program featuring the
wage and price freezes.
   Prices on government-controlled goods and services, such as
tortillas, subway fares and gasoline, have been frozen since March.
   The exchange rate for the peso currency also has held steady
since then, trading at about 2,260 pesos to the U.S. dollar.
   By extending the wage-price freeze through the summer, the
government appears to have guaranteed that inflation will be low
for the crucial July 6 presidential elections.

   An auto dealership fired two black salesmen for
racial reasons and must reimburse them for back pay and rehire them
if they want their jobs back, a federal judge ruled.
   Perillo Pontiac in Chicago violated the Civil Rights Act when it
fired Walter Gilyard and Marion L. Jones in 1986, Judge Prentice
Marshall said.
   Marshall ordered full back pay for the men, who are black, and
ordered Perillo to rehire them if they want their jobs back.
   Gilyard, 48, and Jones, 60, said they were among four blacks on
a 10-member sales staff when new management took over the
dealership in 1986. Within 60 days no blacks were employed at the
company, the two men claimed.
   In ruling on Friday, Marshall said Dennis Kreeger, new-car sales
manager at Perillo, ``manifested the agonies of the damned'' as he
tried to defend the firings when he testified.
   ``We should have had a videotape of Mr. Kreeger,'' the judge
said. ``He trembled, licked his lips ... telling a phony story for
Perillo Pontiac.''
   Kreeger and Anthony Scala, Perillo's general manager, argued
that they fired Gilyard because of absences and insubordination and
fired Jones because he was rude to customers and used ethnic slurs.
   Marshall said the allegations of rudeness were ``absolute
falsehoods,'' noting that the customer who allegedly overheard the
slur ``has amazingly never been found.''

<HEAD>Japanese Envoy To US Urges Free Market System For Japan</HEAD>

   Japan's top envoy to Washington on Monday urged the
Japanese government to open up its market to foreign traders, and
said reassuringly that U.S. leaders were not seeking to destroy the
protected beef and citrus fruit markets.
   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga, in Tokyo for briefings,
said a breakthrough was inevitable in stalled U.S.-Japan talks over
liberalizing Japanese beef and citrus fruit markets.
   Discussions on U.S. access to Japan's beef and citrus markets
``are under way at present and I think that an agreement will be
reached soon,'' Matsunaga told reporters at the Japan National
Press Center.
   The ambassador, a key negotiator in negotiations to replace the
beef and orange agreement that expired in March, said the time was
at hand for Japan, which has benefited from the U.S. free trade
system, to open its markets.
   After talks to settle the beef and orange dispute broke down in
April, Washington on May 4 brought the issue before the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based forum for
international trade disputes.
   Washington has flatly rejected a Japanese concession plan that
would counterbalance a market-opening timetable with new surcharges
on U.S. beef imports, aimed at bringing up prices up to domestic
beef levels.
   Matsunaga discounted criticism in Japan that an open farm market
would destroy the domestic producers.
   ``I feel that the U.S. government is not ignoring'' the plight
of domestic growers, said Matsunaga, who took up his Washington
post three years ago.
   Japanese farmers cultivate uneconomical plots averaging only 2.5
acres in size. Combined with high prices for feed and fertilizers,
domestically produced fruit and beef are among the highest priced
in the world.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Unravel Between Eastman Kodak, Fuqua Industries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to unravel a
merger between units of Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuqua Industries Inc.
that created the nation's largest wholesale photofinishing
operation.
   The court, without comment, rejected a competitor's arguments
that the deal violates antitrust laws.
   The competitor, Phototron Corp. of San Bernardino, Calif.,
sought to block the merger pending the outcome of its antitrust
lawsuit seeking $300 million in damages.
   A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, temporarily blocked the
merger but the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March
overturned the injunction and allowed the merger to occur while
Phototron pursues its suit.
   The appeals court said Phototron failed to demonstrate ``a
substantial likelihood of having suffered an antitrust injury.''
   Relying on a 1986 Supreme Court ruling, the appeals court said,
``To obtain a preliminary injunction, competitors must now supply
evidence of predatory behavior demonstrating a substantial
likelihood that the plaintiff will be injured.''
   Phototron said the appeals court misinterpreted the Supreme
Court ruling and made it impossible to block damaging mergers that
create monopolies.
   Kodak has been given ``a stranglehold on competing
photofinishers,'' Phototron said.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1986, in a meat-packing industry
case, that a company seeking to block a merger ``must show a threat
of antitrust injury and ... a showing of loss or damage due merely
to increased competition does not constitute such injury.''
   Kodak and the Atlanta-based Fuqua Industries merged to create
Qualex Inc., combining the Fuqua subsidiary Colorcraft Corp. with
Kodak-owned laboratories. The new corporation has 94 processing
labs nationwide, with sales estimated at around $300 million a year.
   Phototron, with labs in the South and West, said it already was
being squeezed by Kodak's so-called ``Colorwatch'' marketing
program. Phototron charged that Colorwatch allows Kodak to control
supply and demand by requiring participating retail stores to send
film for processing only to wholesale photofinishers that use Kodak
photographic paper and chemicals exclusively.
   As a result, Phototron said its annual sales have dropped from
$40 million to $22 million because it has lost the accounts of
major retailers.
   Phototron said the Kodak-Fuqua merger will help drive
competitors out of business by predatory pricing and other
monopolistic practices.
   Businesses engage in predatory pricing by undercutting the
prices of competitors in hopes of forcing them to lose money. Then,
when the competitors fold, the merged company raises prices.
   But the 5th Circuit court said Phototron failed to demonstrate
that Kodak is engaging in such predatory pricing.
   The case is Phototron vs. Kodak, 87-1634.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States increased by nine this week to total 892, Baker
Hughes Inc. reports.
   The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity, totaled 762 a year ago.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, announced Monday, reflects the number
of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the
number of rigs producing oil.
   A week ago, the count had dropped by 14.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, California, New Mexico and
Colorado each lost one rig. Louisiana's count dropped by two, while
Oklahoma lost 11 rigs.
   Texas gained two rigs, Ohio's count was up by three, Kansas
posted an increase of four and Michigan got seven more rigs.
Wyoming and Pennsylvania each gained one.

   A federal grand jury has indicted four officials
of one of the nation's largest chemical companies on charges of
negligence in a Tacoma chemical leak.
   The charges against officials of Philadelphia-based Pennwalt
Corp. stem from a Jan. 2, 1985, incident in which a tank collapse
released 75,000 gallons of chemical containing sodium dichromate
into drains that flowed into the Hylebos Waterway.
   Charged Thursday with one count of criminal negligence each
were: Robert S. Custer, former corporate vice president in charge
of chemicals; Franklin M. Shanahan, vice president in charge of the
inorganic chemical division; Edward R. Golinski, chief of the
inorganic chemical division; and Orvil G. High, manager of the
Tacoma plant. All, except High, were based in Pennsylvania.
   High also was charged with four other counts, including filing a
false report with state officials.
   Pennwalt, named in six counts, was charged with federal water
act violations.
   The three Pennsylvania executives were accused of failing to
exercise their duties when they approved what the goverment
contends were inadequate expenditures and measures to deal with the
problems.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Plummet At Opening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened sharply
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to
unexpectedly heavy weekend rain in major crop-growing areas.
   Soybeans plummeted more than 20 cents a bushel within moments of
the opening bell.
   Over the weekend, more than three inches of rain fall in the
extreme western edge of the Corn Belt, which is also prime soybean
land. Rain was falling in Illinois and Indiana today and was
expected to linger in the central Midwest.
   Grain and soybean prices had skyrocketed in the last two months
as dry conditions dominated the spring weather.
   ``This is obviously just a continuation of a very emotional
market and, I think, a forebearer of things to come,'' said Ted
Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
``I think there is uncertainty not only about the weather but about
final acreage as well, and the market will have to sort itself
out.''
   In early trading, wheat was 6\ cents to 13 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.38 a bushel; corn was 4} cents
to 7{ cents lower with July at $2.16{ a bushel; oats were 4\ cents

cents to 27} cents lower with July at $7.58 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .47 cent lower with June at 72.90
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .55 cent higher with
May at 81.05 cents a pound; hogs were .23 cent to .45 cent lower
with June at 53.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .17 cent

   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

<HEAD>Japanese 5-Year Plan To Confirm Shift Away From Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita received a draft
five-year economic plan Monday that pinpoints boosting domestic
demand as the solution to most of Japan's foreign and domestic
economic problems.
   The plan will be debated in Takeshita's Cabinet in coming weeks
and its broad outlines are expected to be confirmed as the
directions of Japan's economy through 1992.
   It calls for a wide range of measures to open and deregulate
Japan's markets to foreign competition, improved quality of life
for the 122 million Japanese and greater Japanese aid to poor
countries.
   In effect it confirms the shift of the Japanese economy in the
last few years away from exports and toward heightened domestic
demand. Under heavy pressure from trading partners such as the
United States and Western Europe, Japan has swung toward domestic
consumption as as a way to keep the economy growing and also
respond to foreign complaints about the country's huge trade
surplus.
   Takeshita asked the Economic Council, a task force reporting to
the prime minister, to form a five-year plan last November after he
succeeded Yasuhiro Nakasone. For six months, 123 prominent Japanese
held more than 70 meetings to draft the plan, which has the
provisional name Economic Management Within The Global Context.
   It says Japan's main problems are how to reduce its trade
surplus, which goverment figures showed at $76 billion last year,
down from $89.7 billion in 1986; how to improve the quality of life
in Japan; and how to promote balanced economic and social
development within Japan.
   The three problems ``can all be resolved by promoting and
consolidating the shift to a domestic-demand-led economy,'' it said.
   The plan does not set a target for reduced trade surpluses, but
says they should reach ``internationally harmonious levels during
the period of the plan.''
   The yen has doubled in value against the U.S. dollar in the past
three years, making Japanese goods more costly and difficult to
sell abroad and increasing sales of foreign goods in Japan.
   The trend should be promoted, the plan said, by measures to make
Japan ``a land of business opportunity for the world at large.'' It
stressed such areas as tariffs, import restrictions, standards and
certification requirements as needing liberalization.
   The plan said ensuring better housing is the ``biggest issue
facing Japan'' on the domestic front. Working people in the Tokyo
area should be able ``to secure quality housing at commutable
distances and reasonably priced in terms of income.''
   The strength of the yen has propelled Japan to great national
wealth, but the Japanese complain that their small houses and
commutes of over an hour on jammed subways lead to a poor quality
of life, and that consumer prices are high by international
standards.
   The plan predicts that inflation will be kept to 1.5 percent
annually and says the heavily managed pricing structures should be
changed to narrow the gap between Japanese and international prices.
   Taking up one of Takeshita's favorite themes, the plan calls for
measures ``to escape the over-dependence on the Tokyo area and to
revitalize non-Tokyo economies.''
   Metropolitan Tokyo, with 12 million people, is the hub of
government and business activity. The plan says some government
offices should relocate outside Tokyo and there should be major
investment in rapid-transit systems to encourage dispersal of the
population, business and industry into other centers.
   Overall, the plan predicts 3.75 percent economic growth annually
during the five-year period. Of that, domestic demand would provide
4.25 percent growth and foreign demand would drop by 0.5 percent
annually, it predicts.
   Japan's post-World War II economic surge was largely based on
exports, and the chairman of the Economic Council, Gaishi Hiraiwa,
said he expected vigorous debate on the plan's emphasis on domestic
demand.
   Attaining the goals will mean ``pain and burden to the people at
large,'' Hiraiwa, chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co., told
reporters at a briefing. ``Therefore, I believe that the
understanding and cooperation of the Japanese people are needed
more than ever.''
   The plan also calls for tax reforms. The government is moving
steadily toward reducing income taxes and introducing taxes on
consumption, like sales taxes or European-style, value-added taxes.
Takeshita has said he will introduce new tax legislation this
summer.

   Chinese first came to Canada as cooks and
launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago. Today they're flying in
from Hong Kong with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and
real estate.
   For the large majority, Canada is a hedge against Hong Kong's
reversion to Chinese Communist sovereignty in 1997.
   While Hong Kong entrepreneurs find easy entry under Canada's
``investor immigrant'' program, hospitals in Toronto and Vancouver
in British Columbia report an increase in the number of Hong Kong
women who come to have babies because the infants automatically
become Canadian citizens.
   Other Chinese come as students and professionals.
   But the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome.
   ``They have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars ($4
million) for a house because in Hong Kong it would be 20 million
($16 million),'' said Premier David Peterson of Ontario.
   One recent buyer was Stanley Ho, whose casino and ferry empire
in Hong Kong and Macao makes him one of Asia's richest men. He paid
5.5 million Canadian dollars ($4.4 million) for a 25-room mansion
on Bridle Path, Toronto's millionaire's row.
   Across the country in Vancouver, Li Ka-shing, whose companies
represent 20 percent of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, won the
bidding in April for the right to develop the choice 210-acre site
of Expo '86.
   Through his 25-year-old son, Victor, a Canadian citizen, Li
plans to spend $1.6 billion to turn the choice downtown strip into
``Pacific Place,'' a high-rise complex that will consist of a
24-hour global financial center, a 400-room hotel, manmade islands
with 10,000 housing units and a 630-berth marina.
   Li and his son also control 52 percent of Husky Oil Ltd.,
Canada's 12th largest oil company, and his Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp. bought the ailing Bank of British Columbia this past
November.
   Officials estimate the current flow of Chinese investment at
$1.6 billion a year, half of it in real estate. Hong Kong Chinese
own one-third of the shopping malls in the Toronto suburb of
Scarborough, one of three metropolitan Chinatowns.
   Edward Hou, a Canadian-Chinese community leader, said his real
estate company deals with 100 Hong Kong investors a month.
   After the first Chinese came for the gold rush and later to work
on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Canada
discouraged further immigration by imposing a tax of $50 a head on
new arrivals. Those who stayed were denied citizenship until 1947.
   Today, 600,000 Canadians are of Chinese descent, including more
than 200,000 in Toronto and 175,000 in Vancouver.
   At any one time, 18,000 Hong Kong students are enrolled at
Canadian universities.
   Hong Kong has become the leading source of immigrants to Canada,
with 22,100 visas issued last year.
   ``I came in 1967,'' said David Lam, a 65-year-old Vancouver real
estate magnate who has donated more than $5 million to British
Columbia universities and the Sun Yat-sen Classical Chinese Garden
in Vancouver, a replica of the ancient gardens of Suzhou.
   Lam pulled off the biggest real estate deal in Vancouver's
history in 1972 and has since built a fortune as a conduit for
other Hong Kong investors.
   ``Now we're seeing more than just flight capital,'' Lam said in
an interview. ``There's a second strata of people, young
professionals who see the writing on the wall for Hong Kong and are
afraid.''
   The Chinese Communists have agreed to allow Hong Kong to
maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after the reversion of
sovereignty, but many Hong Kong Chinese are hedging against that.
   ``Canada is seen as desirable because of its political stability
and large Chinese population.'' said Andrea Eng, a Vancouver
realtor.
   Canada's ``investor immigrant'' program offers a visa in
exchange for investment of 150,000 Canadian dollars ($121,500) to
500,000 dollars ($405,000) in approved businesses.
   Government figures show Hong Kong investment under the program
totaled 776 million Canadian dollars ($628 million) last year and
created 4,500 jobs.
   Premier Peterson of Ontario said he welcomes the well-heeled
arrivals.
   ``Canada has been built by foreign capital _ over 50 percent of
our manufacturing industry is foreign-owned,'' he said.

<HEAD>Survey: Housing Starts at Lowest Point in 5{ Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Builders started 16 percent fewer new housing
units in the first quarter than they in the same period of 1987,
pushing the total to its lowest point in 5{ years, a business
information group reported Monday.
   A nationwide survey by the F.W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co. found that 318,967 units were started in
the first three months of the year, down from 381,292 units in the
1987 period.
   The last time a quarterly total was lower was in 1982, when
298,307 units were started in the third quarter, the company said.
   George A. Christie, chief economist for F.W. Dodge, said the
housing industry faced two problems in the first three months of
1988.
   ``While the rental housing market was digesting the excess of
the mid-'80s tax shelter boom, last year's steady rise of mortgage
rates took its toll of one-family building,'' he said.
   Only three of the nation's largest 25 homebuilding areas posted
gains in the period, according to the survey.
   Washington, D.C., topped the list with 13,310 units started, a 7
percent rise from a year earlier. Norfolk-Virgina Beach-Newport
News, Va., ranked 21st with 3,371 starts, for an 8 percent rise,
while Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, N.C.-S.C., was No. 25 with
2,817 units and a 7 percent increase.
   Los Angeles-Long Beach, Calif., ranked second in the nation with
11,715 units started, a 16 percent drop from the 1987 first quarter.
   Here is how the other top housing areas did:
   _Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif., 11,390 units, down 6 percent.
   _Atlanta, 10,350 units, down 17 percent.
   _Phoenix, Ariz., 6,974 units, down 4 percent.
   _Philadelphia, 5,620 units, down 21 percent.
   _Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla., 5,350 units, down 28
percent.
   _Orlando, Fla., 5,119 units, down 8 percent.
   _Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood-Pompano Beach, Fla., 4,930 units,
down 10 percent.
   _Chicago, 4,842 units, down 27 percent.
   _Seattle, 4,634 units, down 9 percent.
   _Miami-Hialeah, Fla., 4,391 units, down 30 percent.
   _Detroit, 4,372 units, down 34 percent.
   _Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif., 4,012 units, down 19 percent.
   _San Diego, 3,978 units, down 51 percent.
   _Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., 3,748 units, down 30 percent.
   _Boston-Lawrence-Salem-Lowell-Brockton, Mass., 3,687 units, down
22 percent.
   _West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Delray Beach, Fla., 3,681 units,
down 41 percent.
   _Sacramento, Calif., 3,622 units, down 3 percent.
   _Las Vegas, Nev., 3,579 units, down 19 percent.
   _Baltimore, 3,246 units, down 2 percent.
   _Oakland, Calif., 2,874 units, down 55 percent.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois successfully fended off an effort by two
other states to lure away the corporate headquarters of Allied Van
Lines Inc., the nation's largest moving company, Gov. James R.
Thompson said Monday.
   Allied will consolidate its five current offices, including the
main one in suburban Broadview, at a new facility in suburban
Naperville, Thompson told a news conference.
   Allied, which has 830 agents nationwide, will get a $3 million
loan under the Build Illinois Large Business Development Program to
help with relocation costs, the governor said.
   ``Illinois has beaten the Sunbelt,'' Thompson said. ``Texas and
Nebraska were competitors for this consolidation.''
   The decision will keep 850 jobs in the state, and Allied's
parent company, the National Freight Consortium of Britain has
pledged to create an additional 150 jobs in Illinois over the next
two years, the governor said.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
near their lows Monday after falling prey to the slipping Wall
Street market.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell 8.9 points, or 0.50 percent, at 1,761.3, slightly above the
day's low of 1,761.1
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average opened 4.80
points better at 1957.39, but soon changed course and headed lower.
   Throughout most of Monday's trading, dealings were uninspired
and quiet as many players were absent for a religious holiday in
Europe. But Wall Street's influence began to be felt by
mid-afternoon, dragging London shares lower in its wake.
   ``I don't know exactly what it will take to get this market
moving again,'' said Andy Wood, an equities trader at Morgan
Grenfell Securities Ltd., adding that until large institutions
muster the courage to re-enter the market, enthusiasm would likely
remain thin.

<HEAD>Final Chapter In Allegis Shuffle Comes This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegis Corp. stockholders, rejecting the
diversification plans of former Chairman Richard J. Ferris, are
scheduled to meet Thursday to officially change the company's name
back to United Airlines.
   The planned move is welcomed by current Chairman Stephen Wolf.
   ``Now we're back to the core business,'' he said recently. ``We
intend to stay in the core business and build the financial
wherewithal to start growing it.''
   Shedding the Allegis name follows the process of selling off the
company's Westin and Hilton International hotel chains and its
Hertz rental car unit, which were acquired under Ferris.
   Ferris envisioned Allegis as a complete travel service umbrella,
but that philosophy was rejected by stockholders and led to his
ouster in June 1987.
   Hertz Chairman Frank A. Olson took over as interim chairman
until an experienced airline executive could be recruited to take
over the streamlined company.
   In the past four years, Wolf, 46, has specialized in changing
courses for carriers.
   Under Wolf's management, Republic Airlines emerged from
near-bankruptcy to become a healthy merger partner for Northwest
Airlines, and a once-ailing cargo line, Flying Tigers, began
posting record profits.

<HEAD>Microsoft Giving Money-Back Guarantee on Excel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp. on Monday announced a
money-back guarantee for its Excel spreadsheet, saying it was
making the offer in its battle against Lotus Development Corp.'s
best-selling 1-2-3 software package.
   Microsoft's Excel has won acclaim, but many customers are
reluctant to switch to it because they are familiar with Lotus
1-2-3. Both products sell for $495.
   Microsoft said buyers of Excel can receive a full refund through
Jan. 1, 1990.
   ``This guarantee is designed to give customers ample time to
evaluate upcoming versions of Lotus 1-2-3,'' Microsoft said in a
news release.
   Lotus has announced plans for new versions of its popular
spreadsheet software, but in March said the first wouldn't be out
until the fourth quarter.
   Lotus said in a news release Monday that it will ship its 4
millionth spreadsheet product this week. That is nine months after
the company, founded in 1982, shipped its 3 millionth product.
   Excel was introduced six months ago. Pete Higgins, group product
manager for spreadsheets, said sales were increasing at a rate of
30 percent to 40 percent a month.
   Analysts estimate that Lotus 1-2-3 is selling at about 100,000
copies a month, while Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman,
Sachs & Co. in New York, said Excel is selling at about 10,000 a
month.
   Microsoft said it plans a six-week, $700,000 promotional
campaign on its money-back guarantee.

   Stock prices lost ground in slow trading today,
bogged down by worries about inflation and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.77 to
1,939.82 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 7 to 2 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 341 up, 1,150 down
and 438 unchanged.
   Interest rates, which have been climbing for several weeks, were
mixed to slightly higher in the credit markets today, and analysts
said fears remained widespread that they were headed higher still.
   The economy has shown accumulating strength of late, accompanied
by some stirrings of inflation. That has fueled expectations that
the Federal Reserve will sooner or later feel compelled to tighten
credit.
   Texaco fell 1} to 45~ on reports that the company and financier
Carl Icahn were close to agreeing on a plan under which Icahn would
drop a threatened proxy fight for several seats on Texaco's board.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor dropped | to
46]; American Express \ to 23{; International Business Machines |
to 108~, and American Telephone & Telegraph \ to 26{.
   Coated Sales tumbled 2~ to 3~ in the over-the-counter market.
The company said it was investigating two transactions questioned
by Peat Marwick Main & Co., which resigned as its independent
auditing firm.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.31 to 141.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.00 at 289.84.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 84 million shares with an hour

<HEAD>Entrepreneurs Differ From Small Business Owners, Study Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Entreprenueurs are characterized as intuitive thinkers focused
on the future, while small business owners prefer the here and now
and are intent on seeing to details, a study released Monday by
Inc. magazine said.
   A questionnaire poll of 151 founders and co-founders of Inc. 500
companies found these entrepreneurs to be introverted, thinking and
perceiving, according to Charles Ginn, director of the Cincinnati
Small Business Development Center.
   The study showed the profile of the entrepreneur closely mirrors
the classic profile of a professor.
   These findings were compared to a 1982 study of small business
owners conducted by the University of Georgia, which found these
business people commonly making immediate decisions.
   The small business owner is similar to an accountant in
personality profile.
   While both groups were considered successful, the Inc. 500
companies experienced more rapid growth, the study showed.
   Results of the study were released at the 1988 Inc. 500
conference in Cleveland.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Plunge After Wet Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade following a weekend of
unexpectedly wet weather in the Midwest.
   Soybean futures took the hardest hit, with most contracts off at
least 20 cents a bushel at the closing bell. Prices had skyrocketed
in the previous two weeks due to extremely dry weather during the
planting season.
   Some spots in the western Corn Belt received more than three
inches of rain over the weekend.
   ``We got some rains and that pretty much did it,'' said Joel
Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research Department Inc. ``The
technical indicators were grossly overbought and we had a lot of
liquidation right from the start.''
   Karlin said many traders decided to take profits ahead of the
afternoon release of the National Weather Service's six-to-10-day
forecast. But the market's sentiment remained ``extremely
positive,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 7 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.43 a bushel; corn was 5} cents
to 7{ cents lower with July at $2.15{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents
to 3{ cents lower with July at $1.70\ a bushel; soybeans were 18}
cents to 20} cents lower with July at $7.58 a bushel.

<HEAD>Japanese Company Tops List Of Chip Equipment Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Nikon Inc. knocked Perkin-Elmer Corp.
from its traditional top spot to become the world's No.1 seller of
equipment for semiconductor manufacturing last year, according to a
survey released Monday.
   It was the first time a Japanese company headed the list,
according to VLSI Research Inc., a San Jose, Calif.-based
consulting firm that compiles the annual list.
   Nikon moved up from seventh place on the strength of a 62
percent gain in its sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment,
while Perkin-Elmer's sales in the category fell 20 percent, the
consulting firm said.
   Perkin-Elmer, based in Norwalk, Conn., had held the top spot in
the world listings since 1980. One reason for its decline was the
discontinuation of two lines of business that accounted for 5
percent of its sales of semiconductor equipment, VLSI Research said.
   VLSI Research released the full results to The Associated Press
on Monday after Nikon issued a statement Monday saying it had been
listed first.
   The U.S. government has given a high priority to preserving the
health of American companies that make equipment for producing
computer chips, considering them crucial to national security.
   The industry in general, U.S. and Japanese alike, fared somewhat
better in 1987 than in 1986, partly because of streamlining and
improved market conditions, VLSI Research said.
   Nikon's 62 percent rise in sales was partly the result of an 11
percent rise in the value of the Japanese yen. Also, VLSI Research
said its estimate of the company's 1986 revenue in the category,
$149 million, was about 12 percent low.
   Japanese companies' revenue was converted to dollars at a rate
of 150.7 yen to the dollar in 1987 and 168.4 yen to the dollar in
1986.
   Here are the names of the top 10 companies in 1987, followed by
their 1986 rankings and their 1987 revenue from semiconductor
manufacturing equipment:
   _1. Nikon Inc., Japan, up from 7th, $242 million.
   _2. Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, Conn., down from 1st, $213
million.
   _3. General Signal Corp., Stamford, Conn., unchanged, $208
million.
   _4. Advantest, Japan, down from 2nd, $205 million.
   _5. Applied Materials Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., up from 6th,
$174 million.
   _6. Tokyo Electron Ltd., Japan, down from 4th, $173 million.
   _7. Canon Inc., Japan, down from 5th, $151 million.
   _8. Teradyne Inc., Boston, up from 11th, $130 million.
   _9. Varian Associates, Palo Alto, Calif., up from 10th, $125
million.
   _10. LTX Corp., Westwood, Mass., previous year ranking
unavailable, $121 million.

   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has
maintained a link with its Italian partner, Ing. C. Olivetti and
Co. SpA, through the election of a top AT&T executive to Olivetti's
board, the company said Monday.
   There were reports of conflict between the companies earlier
this year after they could not agree on terms for AT&T to boost its
stake in Olivetti, which stands at 22.3 percent.
   Robert M. Kavner, president of AT&T's Data Systems Group, was
elected to Olivetti's board last week, AT&T announced Monday.
   Kavner, who had been AT&T's chief financial officer, was named
last month to head the Data Systems Group on the departure of
Vittorio Cassoni, a respected computer executive who returned to
Olivetti to become managing director.
   Olivetti designs and builds AT&T's personal computers and sells
a variety of AT&T products internationally, mainly in Europe.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has decided against
offering legislation this year to remove antitrust restrictions on
the Bell telephone companies, officials said Monday.
   Although the administration remains convinced the prohibitions
against Bell companies entering certain competitive phone
businesses should be removed, the timing of such a proposal will
not allow it this year, the officials said.
   ``It's late into the final year of this Congress and they have a
full plate,'' said James Spurlock, a spokesman for the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce
Department agency.
   White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker sent a two-paragraph
memo to members of the Cabinet-level Economic Policy Council saying
that President Reagan decided to stop efforts to persuade Congress
to support legislation that would either relax or remove the
restrictions, according to CommunicationsWeek, a trade publication,
which quoted unidentified sources in this week's issue.
   The memo also said the administration had not changed its
opinion that the restrictions should be lifted, the publication
reported.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper declined to comment on the
memo, but said, ``There has been a policy decision that we are not
going to introduce legislation on that topic this year.''
   The Commerce Department has been behind the push within the
administration to allow the Bell companies to offer electronic
information services and manufacture telecommunications equipment.
   Restrictions prohibiting the companies from entering those
businesses and from offering long-distance service were imposed by
the antitrust decree that broke up American Telephone & Telegraph
Co. in January 1984.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who supervises the consent
decree that broke up AT&T, last year ruled the Bell companies could
transmit information services, but he refused to allow them to
generate the information itself. He said the companies continue to
control access to local phone networks, which would give them an
unfair advantage over competitors.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices edged lower in light trading
Monday, as the market worried about speculation of growing supplies
amid weaker-than-expected demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for July delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at
$17.35 per 42-gallon barrel, down 35 cents from Friday.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled at 51.44 cents per gallon, down 0.92 cent, while
wholesale heating oil closed at 46.91 cents per gallon, down 0.80
cent.
   ``This was a dull day,'' said Jayne Ball, an analyst at the Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. securities firm.
   Prices fell because ``OPEC's production is still up there, while
there's some speculation that demand is not as good as a lot of
people thought,'' she said.
   Ms. Ball cited a Wall Street Journal article Monday that quoted
a European consulting firm as putting the 13-nation cartel's
production at 200,000 barrels a day above projected demand for its
crude in the second half of this year.
   Traders have been nervously awaiting the upcoming ministerial
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, due
to begin on June 8.
   The cartel officials are expected to try again to find a way to
limit their output to support prices.
   Meanwhile various reports have suggested that inventories have
been growing as OPEC's production has increased, analysts said.

   Consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks at regional exchanges and in the over-the counter
market, totaled 121.18 million shares.
   Interest rates, which have been climbing for several weeks, were
mostly steady in the credit markets Monday.
   But analysts said fears remained widespread that rates were
headed higher still.
   The economy has shown accumulating strength of late, accompanied
by some stirrings of inflation. That has fueled expectations on
Wall Street that the Federal Reserve will sooner or later feel
compelled to tighten credit.
   More signs of vigorous business activity are expected this week.
On Tuesday the government is scheduled to report on orders for
durable goods in April.
   And on Thursday, when a revised report is issued for the growth
of the gross national product in the first quarter of the year,
many analysts expect the figure to show a substantial increase from
the 2.3 percent annual rate estimated earlier.

<HEAD>Company Agrees to be Acquired by Maxxam Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   KaiserTech Ltd., the world's
fifth-largest aluminum producer, said Monday it had agreed to be
acquired by Maxxam Group Inc. in a deal estimated at $725 million.
   Under the terms of the deal, which would make KaiserTech a
subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based real estate developer and
lumber giant, shareholders would receive $19.375 in cash for each
share of common stock.
   KaiserTech's board of directors approved the deal at a special
meeting Sunday, the company said.
   The company's stock closed at $17.87{ a share on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 25 cents from Friday's closing.
   KaiserTech, the holding company for Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical
Corp., has lost money in recent years, but should make a profit in
1988, one analyst said.
   ``Right now, things in the (aluminum) industry are very
positive. You've got good pricing and got the industry running at
100 percent capacity,'' said Sean St. Clair, an analyst with Duff &
Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The export market has perked up for U.S. producers, given the
currency swings, and then the U.S. share of domestic market has
increased as imports have gone down,'' St. Clair said.
   Maxxam's cash bid, which Salomon Brothers Inc. told KaiserTech
was fair, was recommended to the board by a special committee
appointed earlier this month to consider proposals to acquire the
Oakland-based company, said spokesman Robert W. Irelan.
   KaiserTech received one other bid that proposed a leveraged
buyout from a private investment group, said Irelan, who declined
to identify the other party or discuss their bid.
   Stockholders will vote on the proposed merger at a special
meeting to be called soon, the company said.
   Earlier this year, Maxxam bought 32 percent of KaiserTech's
stock from its chairman, Alan Clore, for about $200 million.
   Last month, KaiserTech sued Clore and Maxxam over a dispute over
rights to nominate directors. But the two companies have agreed to
ask that the litigation be put on hold, Irelan said.
   Maxxam Group Inc., which develops real estate, also owns Pacific
Lumber Co., the world's largest producer of redwood lumber. It has
received widespread criticism for speeding up the cutting of
old-growth redwoods in Northern California.
   KaiserTech, which operates plants in nine states and seven
foreign countries, reported losses in five of the past six years,
primarily because the recession of the early 1980s depressed
aluminum prices, St. Clair said.
   But the industry began to recover in 1986 when prices, which had
dropped to 48 cents per pound, rose to $1.06 per pound, he said.
   KaiserTech reported a net loss of $362 million or $8.11 per
share last year, compared with a loss of $39.8 million in 1986.
Revenues were about $2 billion both years.
   Much of that loss stemmed from the company's restructuring last
year, Irelan said.
   But in the first quarter of 1988, KaiserTech reported net income
of $36.3 million, or 73 cents per share, on revenues of $528.3
million. For the same period of 1987, KaiserTech reported a loss of
$31.1 million, or 69 cents per share, on revenues of $494.2 million.
   Maxxam, however, runs the risk that it could be buying
KaiserTech at a time of peak earnings and the company could be less
profitable because of an economic slowdown predicted next year,
St.Clair said.
   ``I's possible KaiserTech's earnings will turn down, but I don't
expect an actual loss,'' he said.

   The price of gold continued to rise Monday as
the dollar drooped slightly against several major currencies in
thin trading.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $460.30
a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $456.25 an ounce late Friday.
   Gold has risen more than $15 an ounce since early May, partly
because the strength of the U.S. economy has raised fears that the
economy will become overheated and inflation will rise.
   Gold was given an additional boost Monday by a big jump in the
price of platinum, said James Koppel, managing director of Deak
International Trading (U.S.) Ltd.
   Platinum jumped $17.30 a troy ounce to $581.90 an ounce Monday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was in reaction to
renewed rumors that right-wing elements in South Africa would
succeed in cutting off sales of strategic metals to the United
States, Koppel said.
   Gold has been led upward by buyers from the Far East, where
unprecedently strong local currencies make gold look like a
bargain, said Ian MacDonald, a vice president of Credit Suisse in
New York.
   Moreover, MacDonald said, ``The stock markets have looked so
dull and uninteresting, money is clearly coming into metals.''
   In the London market, gold hit its most recent low, $444 a troy
ounce, on May 9. Its lowest point of the year was $425 an ounce on
Feb. 29.
   Foreign currency trading was thin in Europe because many
European markets were closed for a religious holiday. In the United
States, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. did about 40 percent of its
normal amount of business, said James Hohorst, the bank's managing
director for foreign exchange.
   ``It's incredibly quiet,'' Hohorst said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8675 from late Friday's
$1.8615. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.8687 from $1.8640
late Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar edged down 0.02 yen to close at 124.80 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at 124.75 yen. At the end of the trading day
in New York, the dollar fell to 124.52 yen from 124.81 yen late
Friday.
   Other dollar rates in late New York trading, compared with rates
late Friday, included: 1.7018 West German marks, down from 1.7026;
1.4166 Swiss francs, down from 1.4181; 1.2425 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2428; 5.7560 French francs, up from 5.7520; and
1,263.50 Italian lire, up from 1,262.90.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday: 1.7030
West German marks, unchanged; 1.4198 Swiss francs, up from 1.4195;
5.7570 French francs, up from 5.7560; 1.9075 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.9070; 1,263.75 Italian lire, up from 1,263.50, and 1.2427
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2420.
   In Hong Kong, gold bullion rose $3.22 a troy ounce to close at a
bid $460.91 an ounce.
   The price of gold rose in quiet London trading to a bid price of
$459.60 a troy ounce from late Friday's $455.20. The Zurich bullion
market was closed for the holiday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was bid at $462.20 a troy ounce, up from $458.10 an ounce
late Friday.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $6.70 a troy ounce, up
from Friday's $6.64. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $6.738 a troy ounce from $6.690 an ounce
late Friday.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Plummet Following Wet Weekend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices plunged Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade following a weekend of unexpectedly wet weather in
the Midwest.
   On other markets, rain-related selling sent cotton futures
sharply lower; precious metals posted strong gains; energy futures
retreated; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures
were lower.
   Soybean futures took the hardest hit among the grains, with most
contracts off more than 20 cents a bushel at the closing bell.
Prices had skyrocketed in the previous two weeks due to extremely
dry weather during the planting season.
   Some spots in the western Corn Belt received more than three
inches of rain of rain over the weekend.
   ``This is obviously just a continuation of a very emotional
market and, I think, a forebearer of things to come,'' said Ted
Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
``I think there is uncertainty not only about the weather but about
final acreage as well, and the market will have to sort itself
out.''
   Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research Department
Inc., said many traders decided to take profits ahead of the
afternoon release of the National Weather Service's six-to-10-day
forecast. But the market's sentiment remained ``extremely
positive,'' he said.
   The closely watched six-to-10-day outlook called for most of the
United States east of the Mississippi to receive below-normal
rainfall during the first half of next week.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department reported soybean
planting was 62 percent complete as of Sunday. Corn planting was 95
percent finished and cotton planting was 71 percent done.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 7 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.42} a bushel; corn was 5 cents to 7\ cents
lower with July at $2.15{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3\ cents
lower with July at $1.70} a bushel; soybeans were 19 cents to 21{
cents lower with July at $7.57{ a bushel.
   Weekend rains also dampened the enthusiasm for cotton futures on
the New York Cotton Exchange, where the December contract fell 2
cents a pound, the limit allowed for daily trading.
   Like soybean prices, cotton prices have soared in recent weeks
as dry weather dominated the planting season.
   But ``the upward move was largely exaggerated,'' said Ernest
Simon, cotton specialist in New York with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Cotton settled .83 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 65.55
cents a pound.
   Surging platinum led the precious metals market, which showed
surprising strength in the face of tumbling grain and oil prices.
   Platinum was buoyed by overseas buying, particularly from the
Middle East and Japan, analysts said.
   In South Africa, a leader of the opposition political party
urged a boycott on exports of certain ``strategic materials,''
including platinum, to the United States if Congress approves
tougher economic sanctions against South Africa. That action also
supported platinum prices, analysts said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $17.30 to
$17.90 higher with July at $585.90 a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $4.10 to
$5.10 higher with June at $462.80 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5
cents to 4.9 cents higher with May at $6.738 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures slipped on the New York Mercantile Exchange. West
Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 35 cents lower
with July at $17.35 a barrel; heating oil was .51 cent to .88 cent
lower with June at 46.91 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .24
cent to .92 cent lower with June at 51.44 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in a quiet session
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices fell on fears of a drop in wholesale beef prices
and ideas that cash cattle prices were nearing a seasonal peak,
said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc.
   Hog futures also were pressured by fears of lower cash prices.
Frozen pork bellies finished mixed, with technical factors
supporting the near-term contracts, Stanley said.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .72 cent lower with June at
72.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower
with May at 80.90 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .37 cent
lower with June at 53.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.25 cent lower to .77 cent higher with May at 54.02 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.10 points lower at 250.60.

<TEXT>
   Officials from six Great Lakes states signed an
agreement Monday to showcase the region's strengths and promote
economic development through a program of joint lobbying and
marketing.
   The Council of Great Lakes Governors revealed the 13-point plan,
based on recommendations made by a commission appointed by the
council a year ago.
   The governors could not put a price tag on the plan, but said
some of the programs would involve existing state programs. Any
costs will be shared by the states, or the council will seek
outside funding, they said.
   The plan includes a marketing campaign highlighting the region's
business climate and recreational attractions under the theme
``Great Lakes@Great Future.''
   ``The (agreement) represents a blueprint for our future,'' said
Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste. ``Following it, we expect to fashion and
sustain economic progress across our region.''
   Celeste signed the agreement, along with Michigan Gov. James J.
Blanchard, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, and Minnesota Lt. Gov.
Marlene Johnson. Illinois Gov. James Thompson and Indiana Gov.
Robert Orr did not attend Monday's announcement but had endorsed
the agreement, the council said.
   The governors agreed to participate in a joint trade mission
next year, and Celeste suggested Canada as a possible destination.
A trade office also is being planned.
   The agreement also includes:
   _An inventory of educational opportunities in the region.
   _A campaign promoting research capabilities.
   _The establishment of a Great Lakes Development Bank to provide
supplemental financing for small- and medium-sized companies.
   _Creation of a Buy Great Lakes computer network of goods and
services.
   _Development of telecommunication projects for agricultural use.
   _Appointment of a liason to work with state offices in
Washington.
   Celeste, responding to a question, said the agreement did not
specifically include a provision preventing the states from trying
to lure businesses from each other, but said he didn't think that
was a problem.
   ``I think very few of us these days invest any time or energy in
really going into our neighbor states to try to lure business
away,'' he said. ``From time to time there are companies who
propose a move within the region, and we're obliged as governors to
talk to those companies in the interest of our own citizens.''
   Celeste said the Great Lakes states' toughest competition isn't
coming from among themselves or other areas of the country but from
foreign countries.
   According to the council, the six Great Lakes states include the
headquarters of about one-third of the Fortune 500 companies. About
one-fifth of the nation's manufacturing is within the region,
including 70 percent of the steel producaiton, 55 percent of
machine tool business and over half of the automobile production.
   The Great Lakes region also has a $12 billion annual tourist
industry, the council said.

   Poor management practices accompanied losses
that drove the Federal Land Bank in Jackson, Miss., into insolvency
last week, a farm credit official said Monday.
   ``As of last Friday the bank's liabilities exceeded its earning
assets by aproximately $500 million,'' Eric P. Thor, president of
the Farm Credit Assistance Board, told the Senate Agriculture
subcommittee on agricultural credit.
   ``This means that the board of directors and management of the
bank have lost over $300 million in the past three years,'' he
added.
   Thor said sour loans, high debt costs and heavy operating costs
had plagued the bank.
   He said the Jackson bank sought $410 million to $610 million in
assistance this year but was unable to come up with a workable plan
to get out from under.
   ``It seems you have indicated a lot of what you might call poor
management practices down there,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.
   ``I would say that's a fair assessment,'' said Thor, whose board
was established by Congress last year to bail out the ailing Farm
Credit System.
   Lawmakers expressed dismay that the Jackson bank had been
allowed to go downhill until it was beyond rescue. They prodded
officials to avoid any recurrence at other land banks.
   ``We want to avoid another Jackson in Omaha,'' Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., said.
   Meanwhile, the Jackson bank reopened its doors Monday to provide
information to borrowers. A key federal regulator expressed hope
for quick action to restore loan service under supervision of a
receiver.
   ``We are trying very hard to work out an agreement to restore
service with the cooperation of some of the other system
institutions,'' Frank W. Naylor Jr. told a news conference.
   Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration, stressed
that the receiver, REW Enterprises Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., was not
authorized to make loans to customers of the bank, which serves 90
local lending associations in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.
   Thus it would be necessary to reach an agreement with other Farm
Credit System banks to make loans through the receiver-operated,
billion-dollar lending cooperative, whose doors were closed Friday
afternoon after months of losses averaging $4.5 million.
   Such loans would be on an interim basis while the receiver winds
down the activities of the bank, Naylor said.
   The Jackson institution is one of 12 Federal Land Banks within
the massive Farm Credit System, a $50 billion, nationwide network
of borrower-owned banks and local lending associations. The system,
largely unknown to city folk outside the financial industry, is a
longtime bulwark of U.S. agriculture.
   Doldrums in the farm economy in the early 1980s combined with
unfavorable credit agreements plus high overhead within the system
brought some of the banks into hard financial straits in recent
years. That prompted Congress to pass a major bailout bill last
year.
   The Jackson bank received $30 million in aid under the bailout
bill but the assistance board that makes such decisions turned off
the tap last week and instead asked the Farm Credit Administration,
the system's federal regulator, to place the institution in
receivership.
   ``Our responsibility will be to wind down the activities of this
institution,'' Naylor said, adding that it should take less than a
year.
   Naylor was asked if the administrartion's action meant there
soon would be a rash of foreclosures.
   ``Quite the contrary,'' he said. He said those whose loans are
not performing would get the full benefit of ``borrowers rights''
provisions under last year's bailout legislation.
   The receiver's task also would involve placing the bank's
business with other lending institutions, Naylor said. He said it
was expected that some other system lender would move into the
three-state area to take over the Jackson business but that it was
too early to say which one.
   ``We would expect fairly quick action,'' he said.
   He said it would be legal for the receiver to sell assets to
private lending institutions. But he said the Farm Credit
Administration ``certainly will be reviewing all significant
actions in the district.''
   Nayor said there is ``evidence of a turnaround for many'' of the
Farm Credit System institutions during the last year. ``There are
still several land banks facing serious problems, but they're
working their way through them,'' he added.
   The Jackson bank's porfolio of more than 21,000 loans totaled
$1.68 billion at year's end, but 40 percent of that amount was tied
up in loans classified either as nonaccrual or high-risk.
Liabilities, meanwhile, reached $1.909 billion on March 31.

<HEAD>Western Union Reports $625 Million Quarter Loss, Mostly Special
Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp. on Monday
reported a $625.2 million first-quarter loss, most of which
resulted from costs connected with the telecommunication company's
reorganization.
   The loss, blamed on the costs of a major restructuring, compared
with a loss of $18.8 million in the same period a year ago.
   Special charges of $603 million in the first quarter resulted
from write-downs connected with the planned unloading of the
company's microwave and voice-switching facilities, officials said.
   The write-downs reflect the company's exit from the business of
providing communications facilities to focus on specialized
business and consumer services.
   The charges also resulted from severance and pension costs
stemming from its previously announced plan to lay off 1,800
employees, or 25 percent of the work force, by the end of the year,
and from costs related to the curtailing of a management pension
plan.
   Revenues were $235 million, compared to $205 million for the
previous first quarter. Figures in 1987 do not include revenues
from ITT Corp.'s international telex unit. ITT World Communications
Inc. was acquired in December 1987 as part of Western Union's
down-to-the-wire restructuring.
   Savings from the layoffs were not reflected in the 1988 figures.
   President Robert J. Amman said the facilities sales would ``help
reduce the burden of fixed costs associated with the operation of a
nationwide telecommunications plant.''
   The company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange dropped to
$3, down 12.5 cents, on the news.
   One analyst said he looked on the write-downs as expected and
not unwelcome, and usually a good sign in the telecommunications
business.
   ``It's better to take them right off, get the bad egg out and
move ahead'' rather than let old wounds fester, said Stuart Ganes
of Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. in New York.

   Firestone Inc.'s U.S. plants were up to
almost full operation Monday after a tentative contract agreement
ended a weeklong strike by 4,700 members of the United Rubber
Workers union.
   The president of the United Rubber Workers, Milan Stone, said
the results of the bargaining showed the effectiveness of using the
Goodyear contract as a pattern for the Firestone contract.
   ``While some companies and some analysts have said our system
(of pattern bargaining) has outlived its usefulness, we feel that
it is the most fair and reasonable way to accomplish our goals,''
Stone said in a written statement.
   The URW, meanwhile, was awaiting the results of a vote by a
local in Gadsden, Ala., on a settlement reached last week with
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. Union officials, though, announced
Sunday that enough locals had voted in favor of the contract to
ensure its approval.
   Nine of 11 Goodyear locals, representing 10,575 URW members,
approved the contract.
   Firestone employees returned to work at plants in six states
late Sunday, the same day company and union negotiators approved a
tentative contract. Firestone spokesman James Strandberg said
production was approaching normal levels on Monday.
   URW spokesman Curt Brown said the Firestone pact followed a
pattern set by the settlement reached with Goodyear shortly before
a strike deadline May 17.
   Brown said the union's contract with Goodyear was effectively
ratified when the 1,700-member Local 2 in Akron ``overwhelmingly
approved'' the contract Sunday. No figures were released.
   Ratification votes on the Firestone proposal are expected to be
held this week at company offices and plants in Akron; Noblesville,
Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Russellville, Ark.; and
Oklahoma City, Brown said.
   The Firestone and Goodyear contracts both offer workers an
immediate 25-cent wage increase that is to be deducted from future
cost-of-living increases in increments of 10 cents, 10 cents and 5
cents.
   The 6,500 URW members who work for Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.
ratified a three-year agreement by May 16 that guarantees against
plant closings but includes a limitation on cost-of-living raises
during the first year, the union said.
   ``The URW demonstrated its concern for keeping Uniroyal Goodrich
viable, and we trust this will pay off in future improvements for
these members,'' Stone said.

<HEAD>Court Says Fixed Annuities Fall Under Securities Law</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling
that put millions of so-called fixed annuities under the
jurisdiction of federal securities laws.
   Under the lower court ruling, fixed annuities paying fluctuating
interest rates could be regulated the same as stocks and bonds.
   Insurance industry officials had opposed the rule, claiming it
imposed a heavy regulatory burden that would raise company costs
and translate into higher prices for consumers.
   In other business-related actions Monday, the high court:
   _Agreed to study the power of states to regulate natural gas
production, including ``use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to
stimulate production.
   _Refused to unravel a merger between units of Eastman Kodak Co.
and Fuqua Industries Inc. that created the nation's largest
wholesale photofinishing operation.
   _Gave states some power to enforce safety codes at federal
nuclear production facilities for hazards unrelated to radiation.
   The insurance industry had been watching the annuities case
closely, since it involved policies held by millions of customers
and representing billions of dollars.
   Among these, fixed annuities traditionally have been regarded as
insurance contracts because investors never risk their principal.
Annuity holders are assured of receiving the money contributed plus
a certain amount of interest in payments made at regular intervals.
   Holders of fixed annuities are assured of a minimum rate of
return on contributions. And most annuity plans provide for
``excess interest'' paid at the discretion of the annuity company.
   In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that so-called variable
annuities, those that do not assure any minimum interest payments
on contributions, may be treated as securities regulated by federal
law.
   But a ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last April
15 marked the first time a fixed annuity was also treated as a
security.
   Beverly Otto sued the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co.
(VALIC) in 1982, contending that the fixed annuity is a
``security,'' and that VALIC had violated anti-fraud provisions of
federal securities law.
   A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that the fixed
annuity is not a security.
   But the 7th Circuit court reversed that ruling, reinstating the
suit. The appeals court said VALIC's fixed annuity did not qualify
for such treatment because its excess-interest rate on existing
deposits could be changed at any time at VALIC's discretion.
   By refusing to hear the case, the high court let that ruling
stand.
   ``We were hoping the Supreme Court would take the case,'' said
John Adney, an attorney representing the Washington-based industry
group, National Association of Life Companies, on Monday.
   He noted that under the appeals court ruling, fixed annuities
contracts must be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, ``and be subject to their regulation _ not just
regulation by state insurance departments.''
   ``That means considerable expense and complications for the
insurance companies _ and for the situation of the policy
holders,'' he added.
   While big companies can afford those added expenses, he said,
the NALC feared that the increased costs could mean that ``smaller
companies might not be able to shoulder the increased risk, or to
compete in the market.''
   In the natural gas case, the high court said it would review a
ruling upholding the power of Kansas officials to control
production from what is believed to be the largest natural gas
reservoir in the world.
   The Kansas Supreme Court in 1987 upheld rules adopted by the
Kansas Corporation Commission covering gas from the Hugoton Field,
most of which is carried outside the state through pipelines.
   Since 1944, the Kansas Corporation Commission permitted owners
of underproducing wells to ``save up'' their authorized production
ceilings _ creating what are called ``underages'' _ and overproduce
in future months to make up for shortfalls.
   To create a production incentive, the Kansas commission changed
the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within
specified periods of years or they would be canceled.
   The rule was challenged by Northwest Central Pipeline Corp., one
of the major buyers of the Hugoton gas for transport outside the
state. It asked the Supreme Court to strike down the 1983
regulations on grounds that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production.
   In the Kodak-Fuqua case, the court rejected a competitor's
arguments that the deal violates antitrust laws.
   The competitor, Phototron Corp. of San Bernardino, Calif.,
sought to block the merger pending the outcome of its antitrust
lawsuit seeking $300 million in damages.
   A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, temporarily blocked the
merger but the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March
overturned the injunction and allowed the merger to occur while
Phototron pursues its suit.
   Kodak and the Atlanta-based Fuqua Industries merged to create
Qualex Inc., combining the Fuqua subsidiary Colorcraft Corp. with
Kodak-owned laboratories. In a ruling on injuries, the court, said
a worker injured falling from a scaffold at a federally supervised
nuclear plant in Ohio, is entitled to seek a ``bonus'' compensation
award under a state law.
   The court ruled against Goodyear Atomic Corp., which operates
the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant near Piketon, Ohio.

<HEAD>Judge Rules For AB Electrolux In Murray Ohio Takeover</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: ADDS new grafs 2-3 to UPDATE with Electrolux raising bid to
$197 million; picks up 2nd graf pvs bg'ng, U.S. District ...; ADDS

   A federal judge Monday cleared the way
for Sweden's AB Electrolux to pursue its $182 million hostile bid
for Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co., a maker of lawn mowers and
bicycles.
   Electrolux announced immediately that it would increase its bid
to $197 million _ upping the tender offer from $48 to $52 per share
of Murray Ohio common stock. Electrolux said the tender offer would
be subject to shareholder approval ``only if AB Electrolux is not
satisfied that the Ohio Control Share Act is inapplicable to the
offer.''
   The Ohio Control Share Act is an anti-takeover law, and the
Electrolux statement said it would seek a ruling from federal
courts in Ohio that the act is inapplicable.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman dissolved a temporary
injunction against Electrolux's $48-a-share offer by discounting
Murray Ohio's allegations that a New York law firm which once
represented the Tennessee company passed confidential information
to Electrolux.
   The firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, had advised Murray Ohio on how to
defend itself against takeovers before it represented Electrolux in
its tender offer.
   Hans G. Backman, executive vice president of the Stockholm-based
appliance maker, had testified last week that Electrolux received
no confidential information directly or indirectly from Sullivan &
Cromwell.
   He said his company based its action on Murray Ohio's annual
stockholders' report as well as other public documents.
   ``All the information appeared in an (magazine) article that was
readily available to any professional investigator,'' Wiseman
agreed, in his ruling.
   Electrolux also said Monday it has no plans to move Murray Ohio
operations from the present plant at Lawrenceburg, Tenn.

<HEAD>Clothing Maker Gets Three Years In Tax Evasion Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Jersey clothing manufacturer was
sentenced to three years in prison in the nation's largest payroll
tax evasion case, authorities said Monday.
   Jerome A. Finkelstein, 63, could have received 35 years in
prison for his guilty plea to charges he failed to pay income and
Social Security taxes on $1 million in wages paid to illegal
aliens, mostly Polish, said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   Finkelstein owned a factory destroyed in a Labor Day 1985 fire
in Passaic, N.J., that destroyed 27 buildings housing 100 families
and 60 companies and that caused an estimated $400 million in
damage. Authorities said about 80 to 100 people worked at
Finkelstein's factory.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriquez in Camden also gave
Finkelstein, of Englewood, N.J., five years probation at the
sentencing Friday.
   He was accused of paying the $1 million in wages in 1981 and
1982 out of a separate checking acount. He operated a group of
women's clothing companies under the umbrella name European
Tailoring Group Ltd. of Passaic.
   Alito said it was the largest case of payroll withholding tax
evasion in the United States.
   In court papers, Finkelstein said hiring the aliens helped ``the
policy of the United States government at that time ... to aid and
assist those who were struggling for survival of the Solidarity
Labor Union and otherwise seeking freedom from Communist
oppression,'' according to Alito's office.
   He claimed it was unfair to make illegal aliens pay taxes to the
government when they received nothing in return ``as a matter of
law.''
   Finkelstein's wife Ethel wrote the judge saying that her
husband's company made clothes for top designers including Ralph
Lauren, Oscar De La Renta, Bill Blass and Calvin Klein, according
to Alito.

<HEAD>FTC Seeks Injunction In McCormick Acquisition of Specialty Brands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Monday it
would seek a preliminary injunction to block McCormick & Co. Inc.'s
proposed $56 million acquisition of Specialty Brands Inc. on
grounds the merger may be anti-competitive.
   The FTC authorized its staff to seek the injunction, saying the
``acquisition could substantially reduce competition in the
production and sale of spices.''
   FTC spokeswoman Susan Ticknor said the commission, voting 4-0,
authorized its staff to ask a federal district court to block the
acquisition pending administrative proceedings to determine the
legality of the takeover.
   U.S. District Court Judge John H. Pratt on April 26 had
temporarily enjoined the merger at the FTC's request while the FTC
sought additional documents from McCormick to determine if the
merger would be anti-competitive.
   McCormick, based in Hunt Valley, Md., is the world's largest
spice producer. San Francisco-based Specialty Brands makes Spice
Islands gourmet spices and is owned by UB Foods U.S. Inc., a
holding company for the U.S. interests of United Biscuits
(Holdings) PLC, a major British company.
   Specialty recently sold its salad dressing and olive business to
Campbell Soup Co. McCormick was seeking to buy Specialty's Spice
Islands and Taste of Americana gourmet operations.
   A spokesman for Specialty Brands said the company had no
comment. Spokesmen for McCormick could not be reached for comment
Monday night.
   McCormick said earlier this month it had reached an agreement
with the FTC to allow it to proceed with its bid.
   McCormick said at the time that legal obstacles preventing it
from acquiring Spice Islands had been lifted under an agreement
with the FTC.
