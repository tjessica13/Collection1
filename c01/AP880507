   The government plans to start administering
drug tests to applicants for sensitive federal jobs and will refuse
employment to all who don't have confirmed negative tests,
according to a published report Saturday.
   ``This procedure will have a positive effect on reducing
instances of illegal drug use by employees ... and will provide for
a safer work environment,'' the Office of Personnel Management said
in a statement quoted in The Washington Post.
   Under the OPM plan _ based on plans submitted by dozens of
federal agency to Congress this week _ applicants about to be hired
for 345,528 sensitive positions will have to undergo urinalysis
tests with less than 48 hours notice, the newspaper said. The tests
will cover at least marijuana and cocaine.

<TEXT>
   A regent at the University of Oklahoma has
joined a group of students who are pleading with school officials
to change the name of a building named after a former leader of the
Ku Klux Klan.
   ``The time is right for a change,'' the regent, Sylvia Lewis,
said Friday. ``We shouldn't be perpetuating discrimination at one
of our flagship universities.''
   Faculty and student organizations at the university have asked
the regents to change the name of the chemistry building, which was
dedicated in 1917 as Debarr Hall after Edwin DeBarr, one of the
first four professors at Oklahoma.
   DeBarr established the school of pharmacy in 1894 and later the
first school of petroleum engineering. He was a vice president of
the university from 1909 to 1923.
   DeBarr was an Oklahoma grand dragon of the KKK, and in 1924 he
was a national chaplain of the Klan.
   In 1922, the university's regents censured DeBarr for his
involvement with the Klan and he was dismissed from the university
in 1923.
   ``The name is inappropriate,'' said Roland Lehr, acting chairman
of the chemistry department. In recent weeks, students have staged
a protest in front of the building.
   Oklahoma President Frank Horton declined comment on the issue on
Friday.

<HEAD>President Irritated At Former Aide Donald Regan's Book</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald T. Regan, often at odds with first lady
Nancy Reagan when he was White House chief of staff, now apparently
has alienated President Reagan with his forthcoming book.
   The book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington,''
makes assertions about Mrs. Reagan's interest in astrology that the
president appears to view as a personal attack on his wife.
   During a photo session at the start of a Cabinet meeting Friday,
reporters asked Reagan whether he felt betrayed or angered by the
book.
   ``Well, I will say this, that I would have preferred it if he'd
decided to attack me, and apparently from what we hear he's chosen
to attack my wife, and I don't look kindly upon that at all,'' the
president replied.
   Tom Dawson, a Regan spokesman, said Regan ``has had and will
have no comments regarding his book until it is published.'' He
said the book is expected to be in stores beginning Monday.
   But Strobe Talbott, Washington bureau chief of Time magazine,
which will publish excerpts of the book, said Friday that Regan's
book ``paints an absolutely devastating picture of the Reagan
administration.''
   ``It characterizes the kind of inside scene there to be a little
bit like the court of the Medicis ... with a little bit of Lady
Macbeth and maybe the Keystone Cops.''
   Talbott, in comments on the syndicated discussion show ``Inside
Washington'' scheduled for broadcast today, said the book portrays
an unidentified San Francisco astrologer friend of Mrs. Reagan as
``a kind of absentee presence almost at the Cabinet table or at
least right outside the Oval Office, working first through Mrs.
Reagan.''
   An excerpt from Talbott's appearance on the show was aired
Friday by WUSA-TV in Washington.
   The president in the past has reacted sharply to criticism of
his wife or suggestions that she interferes or has too great a role
in administration decision-making.
   Regan, the president's former top staff aide and treasury
secretary, had an uneasy relationship with Mrs. Reagan, whose
opposition is widely believed to have been behind his ouster as
chief of staff early last year.
   The president in the past has praised Regan's contribution to
his administration, and the former Wall Street executive was one of
the most enthusiastic and loyal defenders of Reagan policies.
   During the aftermath of the Iran-Contra scandal, in which money
from arms sales to Iran was diverted to the Nicaragua Contra
rebels, Regan and the first lady had telephone arguments over how
to handle the matter, reportedly ending with her hanging up on him.
   In his book, Regan is said to reveal that Mrs. Reagan used
astrology to determine the timing of the president's speeches and
travel.
   The president has denied that any of his decisions have been
influenced by astrology, in which the position of the sun, moon and
stars are studied in the belief that they influence human affairs.
   The White House says Mrs. Reagan has followed astrology since
before the Reagans came to the White House. Her interest was
heightened by the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt against her
husband, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier this week.
   Fitzwater said that as far as he knows, Reagan's interest in
astrology is limited to reading his horoscope.
   Reagan said Friday he did not expect Regan to send him a copy of
his book, which is being published by Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich,
``unless I'm prepared to send a check in return.''
   The president previously has made disparaging comments about
so-called ``kiss-and-tell'' books by former aides.
   Last month, for example, he was asked his opinion of a book by
former White House spokesman Larry Speakes, in which Speakes
revealed that on two occasions he made up quotes and attributed
them to the president.
   Reagan said last month he was not aware of Speakes' actions at
the time and added: ``I can tell you right now that I have no
affection for these kiss-and-tell books that are being written and
I find it entirely fiction.''
   Asked Friday what his book-writing advice would be for members
of his Cabinet and current aides, the president gestured around the
table and said, ``I trust all these people.'' The room erupted in
laughter.

   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley misled
the public by asserting a study showed the new 65 mph speed limit
had no discernible effect on the traffic death rate, a former
Carter administration official said.
   ``I think that Burnley is just trying to make a political case
for doing what he wants to do, and that the statistics in fact
contradict his position, and he's trying to maneuver the
statistics,'' said Joan Claybrook, who headed the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration under President Carter.
   Ms. Claybrook now is president of Public Citizen, a policy group
often critical of the Reagan administration.
   ``It is totally absurd but expected from Joan Claybrook,'' said
Transportation Department spokesman Ron DeFore. ``Joan has
consistently been a critic of NHTSA under this administration, and
this study, this interim report, does not support her point of
view.''
   The department, in a report presented to Congress on Friday,
said raw data showed only a 1 percentage point difference in
traffic fatality increases on rural interstate highways having the
higher speed limit and those retaining the 55 mph national speed
limit adopted in 1974.
   ``We're just not finding any distinction,'' Burnley said after a
speech this week to the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   The study, however, analyzed the traffic data in several ways,
and some of the results suggest the higher speed limit results in a
higher fatality rate, said the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, an insurance industry organization.
   Institute President Brian O'Neill said the most reliable finding
in the report used a mathematical model to examine traffic fatality
data since 1975.
   That method concluded that fatalities on rural interstate
highways increased by 20 percent in the first four or five full
months following adoption of the higher speed limit compared with
the fatalities that would otherwise have been expected.
   Most of the states raised their speed limits on rural highways
in April and May of last year.
   ``I think there is no question that these numbers are
confirming, unfortunately, what all the prior evidence suggested
was going to happen, that the higher speed limits would translate
into higher speeds,'' O'Neill said.
   Using other methods, the study found:
   _During the first nine months of 1987, traffic fatalities on
highways with the 65 mph limit rose 18 percent from a year earlier
in 37 states that had adopted the higher speed, compared with a 17
percent increase in 11 states that had not.
   _From Jan. 1, 1987, to the time of the speed limit change,
fatalities had increased 10 percent from the corresponding period a
year earlier. After the speed limit was raised through Sept. 30,
1987, fatalities were 23 percent higher than a year earlier, the
study said.
   _The 23 percent increase in fatalities on rural interstates
after the speed limit was changed compared with a 13 percent
decline in fatalities on urban interstates during the same period
and a 5 percent decline in fatalities on non-interstate roads.
   Individual states also showed a great variety in
traffic-fatality patterns on rural interstates from June 1987
through September 1987, the study said.
   Ten states that increased the speed limit had fewer fatalities
than in the corresponding period a year earlier. They were
Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire,
North Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Georgia, which
did not raise speed limits, also showed a decline.
   Nine states that kept the lower speed limit during the period
had more fatalities. They were Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and
Virginia.
   O'Neill said that data could be misinterpreted as meaning speed
limits contributed to increased deaths in some areas but not in
others. ``The fact is that fatality figures are small enough in
each state for wide fluctuations to be expected,'' he said.
   On all highways, the number of fatalities increased in 1987, but
the number of miles traveled by vehicles on the nation's highways
was substantially higher than in 1986, Burnley said in a speech
this week.

<TEXT>
   Once again into the breach, as judgment
draws near in yet another chapter of the endless saga of bad
writing _ otherwise known as the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest.
   On Sunday, San Jose State University Professor Scott Rice and
his fellow conspirators will announce which of 11,000 entries is
the most miserable, least readable and rottenest lead sentence to
the crummiest novel imaginable.
   Rice, the founder of the annual literary disgrace he calls ``the
Baltimore Orioles of literature,'' says he is pledged to unearthing
the best of the worst of written communication.
   The contest trashes the battered memory of the 18th century's
Edward George Earle Bulwer-Lytton, whose turgid style was
characterized by these immortal opening words: ``It was a dark and
stormy night ...''
   Among the contestants is Richard G. Patching of Calgary,
Alberta, who wrote:
   ``The mist clung to the mountain the same way a 13-year-old-girl
clings to her boyfriend, although the mountain wasn't thinking
about getting lucky.''
   Rice said the contest is a gentle reminder to the world of
letters that it's okay to lighten up, forget the grammar books for
a minute and have some fun, ``approach the language recreationally
as well as practically.''
   Rice figures he has read nearly 80,000 unprintable sentences,
his favorite being one that starts out, ``The bone-chilling scream
split the warm summer night in two ...''
   That was such a perfect example of the mind-numbing prose of
Bulwer-Lytton, Rice said, that the writer, Patricia E. Presutti of
Lewiston, N.Y., won the grand prize for 1986.

<HEAD>Johnny Carson Files Suit Against Former Attorney `Bombastic
Bushkin'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Tonight Show'' host Johnny Carson has filed
suit against his former friend and attorney Henry Bushkin, seeking
$16.6 million for repayment of a loan note used to cover a failed
real estate development.
   The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf
of Carson Tonight Inc., claimed the company purchased the note used
to guarantee a loan made to Willowbrook West Ltd., a real estate
limited partnership.
   Willowbrook's sole asset is a 93-acre parcel of land in Houston,
Texas, purchased in 1981 with plans to build a hotel and sell off
other lots.
   Bushkin represented Carson in several business matters and two
of the entertainer's divorces in a professional relationship dating
back to the early 1970s. Carson often referred to him as
``Bombastic Bushkin'' in monologues that joked about investment
advice from the attorney.
   Telephone calls seeking comment were left with both Bushkin's
office and that of Carson's new attorney, E. Gregory Hookstratten.
   Legal problems stalled the Willowbrook project and were solved
only in time for the bottom to fall out of the Houston real estate
market.The property remains undeveloped.
   Willowbrook's original partners included Carson and Bushkin, two
of Bushkin's law partners, playwright Neil Simon and others. The
lawsuit names Bushkin law partners Jerry K. Staub and John Gaims as
co-defendants.
   The lawsuit claimed Carson Tonight purchased the $18.5 million
note from United Savings Association in Texas in December of 1986.
The 1985 loan was used to ``pay off prior loans and to fund
development of and improvements on the property,'' the lawsuit said.
   In March, Carson Tonight demanded payment from Willowbrook for
the remaining note sum of $16.6 million, the lawsuit contends.
Willowbrook failed to pay the sum, the suit alleged.
   The document also said the property was to be foreclosed.

<HEAD>US May Send Aid to Contras Despite Sandinista Objections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration says it is looking
at ways to help thousands of Nicaraguan rebels facing acute food
shortages during stalled negotiations between the Contras and the
Sandinista government.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Friday the
alternatives include direct deliveries of food to rebel forces or
cash payments to be used for food purchases.
   Any such move would almost certainly touch off a vigorous
Sandinista protest that the terms of the temporary cease-fire
agreed to by the Contras and the government on March 23 was being
violated.
   The Nicaraguan government maintains that U.S. humanitarian aid
can be delivered only after the rebels have been resettled in seven
designated cease-fire zones and if a verification commission
confirms the contents.
   No Contras have been resettled because there has been no
agreement on ground rules governing activities in the cease-fire
zones. Both the administration and the Contras have accused the
Sandinistas of resorting to delaying tactics to deny the rebels
access to food.
   Although Redman provided no specifics, the aid _ whether food or
cash _ apparently would be sent into Nicaragua by rebel forces
based in Contra camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   The aid program is being managed by the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which began deliveries to Honduran-based
Contras two weeks ago.
   AID has denied charges by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
that the deliveries contained weapons and are illegal because there
was no prior inspection by an officially designated verification
commission.
   The $48 million aid package, approved by Congress five weeks
ago, includes $10 million for the commission, which includes
Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and Organization of
American States Secretary General Joao Baena Soares.
   Redman said the administration has reached tentative agreement
on funds for the commission but no plan has been received from the
OAS that meets ``minimum accountability standards.''

   The United States has told the Afghan
guerrillas they must control territory and create an ``effective''
administrative structure if they want to establish an
internationally recognized provisional government.
   In the first public airing of its views on a provisional regime
to rival the Soviet-backed government in Kabul, the State
Department said Friday the Afghan resistance must meet certain
criteria before receiving U.S. recognition as a government.
   The possibility of such a provisional government has been
heightened since a Soviet agreement last month to withdraw its
estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan within nine months. The
agreement envisions the return of millions of Afghan refugees and
the establishment of an independent government.
   A provisional regime presumably would give the Afghan resistance
forces a head start in their drive to replace the weakened Marxist
government in Kabul once the Soviet forces leave the country.
   U.S. officials have predicted the Kabul government headed by
Afghan leader Najibullah will collapse once the Soviets withdraw.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the first
``essential step'' is for the Soviets to pull their forces out,
which will ``create an evironment more conducive to a genuine
process of self-determination and establish a more broadly based
government.''
   Zalmay Khalilzad, an adviser to Undersecretary of State Michael
Armacost, met with resistance leaders recently and reportedly
outlined the criteria under which a provisional government would be
acceptable to the United States.
   ``The resistance is well aware of our views,'' Redman said.
``There are a number of important criteria for any government to
have international acceptability.''
   The test is whether a government ``controls territory, has an
effective government structure, possesses the capacity to exercise
the valid international obligations and enjoys broad support,'' he
said.
   Redman cautioned that it would be ``premature'' to disclose
``when or under exactly what conditions we would be prepared to
establish relations with any government in Afghanistan.'' He would
not, for example, define how much territory a government must
control or how strongly its grip must be.
   The United States is ``not involved in any efforts to form a
provisional government with the resistance or anyone else.''
   The spokesman belittled the significance of reports by Indian
officials that Najibullah expressed an interest during talks in New
Delhi in sharing power with the guerrilla groups.
   ``It's clear that PDPA, Najibullah's party, lacks popular
support among the Afghan people,'' Redman said. ``He's made these
professions of interest in power-sharing before and his
formulations have always lacked credibility and still do. They've
never addressed the issue of genuine power-sharing but rather
amount to PDPA domination of the government.''

   James Watt says his first foray into
politics since returning to his native Wyoming has been quite
different from his troubled tenure as U.S. secretary of the
interior.
   ``It's been a lot of fun,'' Watt said Friday at the Wyoming
Republican Convention, where he is serving as a delegate.
   The former secretary said attitude is one key distinction
between politics in Wyoming and in Washington.
   ``There is a lot better perspective,'' he said. ``Because the
concern here is for people. There is compassion and understanding
for the concerns of one another. In Washington, it is a power
struggle, group against group, interest against interest.''
   Watt, President Reagan's first interior secretary, quit in 1983
after making remarks considered offensive by many blacks, Jews,
women and the handicapped. He also angered environmentalists, who

   Millionaire industrialist Armand
Hammer has apparently ended an effort to collect $760,000 from the
estate of his brother.
   Victor Hammer, a Palm Beach resident and founder of New York's
renowned Hammer Galleries, died in 1985 and his brother was named
co-executor of the $1.5 million estate.
   Hammer, 88, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., later filed
suit against the estate, claiming Victor never repaid loans made to
him between 1983 and 1985.
   Nancy Eilan, Victor Hammer's adopted daughter, sought
unsuccessfully to have Armand Hammer removed as co-executor.
   All issues were resolved April 12, when the parties, including
Victor Hammer's son, Armasha, a resident of the Soviet Union,
agreed to split the estate.
   Armand Hammer's portion is not specified in the agreement, but
it is not expected to equal his $760,000 request, his attorney, D.
Culver Smith, told The Fort Lauderdale News in a story published
Friday.
   Eilan's attorney, James Pressly, would not comment on the

   The 590-foot Cypriot-registered freighter had just unloaded
steel and was about a mile from Lake Michigan when the accident
occurred shortly after 8 p.m., Zelner said. He said he had no
immediate report on damage.
   The freighter, which was headed for Lake Michigan, hit the 50-to
70-foot-long bridge, which was in the open position, said police
Sgt. Ron Magro.
   Howard Schillaci, a sales clerk at a fishing gear store, said he
saw the accident from his shop window.
   ``The ship was coming through, and all of a sudden, the bridge
broke loose and came down on top of the back end of the ship,''
Schillaci said. ``It sounded like a car accident.''
   Magro said the Baltimore and Ohio bridge is about 100 years old
is still used, although he said it believes only by freight trains.
Zelner said the bridge was 19 feet above the water when closed, 135
feet when open.
   ``It's old, and I know it's real rusted,'' Schillaci said.

   A strong earthquake rocked northern Japan on
Saturday morning, the Central Meteorological Agency said. National
police said there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
   The agency said the quake, centered off the coast of the
northernmost island of Hokkaido, occurred at 10:59 a.m. (9;59 p.m.
Friday EDT) and measured a preliminary reading of 6.4 on the
Richter scale.
   CMA officials said the quake registered a four on the Japanese
scale of seven in Kushiro, 560 miles northwest of Tokyo, three in
Aomori, 360 miles away, and one in Tokyo.
   A tremor measuring five on the Japanese scale can crack walls,
overturn gravestones, and damage chimneys. A four will shake houses
and topple vases.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake
at its epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of five on the scale is considered ``very strong''
and a six ``severe,'' capable of widespread damage near the
epicenter.
   Every increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase in
magnitude, thus a reading of 7.5 would be 10 times stronger than
one of 6.5.
   The Japanese scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a
particular location and is not convertible to the Richter scale.

<HEAD>American Firm Halts Tear Gas Sales To Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arab-American lobbying group is praising a
California company's decision to stop selling tear gas to Israel,
saying the move is a symbolic victory for Palestinians.
   ``We hope the decision will send a signal to (Israeli) Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir that he can no longer count on corporate
America's cooperation in denying the Palestinians their most basic
human rights,'' the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee
said in a statement Friday.
   The statement came after an official of TransTechnology Corp.,
of Sherman Oaks, Calif., said the board of directors had agreed to
the company's new policy under which the firm will no longer sell
tear gas to Israel.
   ``We want some breathing room,'' said Burl Alison,
TransTechnology's vice president, describing the company's decision.
   The company, which makes tear gas at its Federal Laboratories in
Saltsburg, Pa., had been under ``tremendous pressure'' from
Arab-American groups and human rights activists to stop the sales,
she said.
   The groups claimed the Israelis have misused the tear gas in
quelling Palestinian demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, causing deaths and injuries.
   Yossi Gal, a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy, disputed
allegations that his government deliberately has misused tear gas,
and pointed out that tear gas is routinely used by police and
military forces around the world.
   He described as wildly exaggerated the allegations that as many
as 40 people in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip had
been killed by improper use of tear gas.
   Mrs. Alison did not rule out the possibility that tear gas sales
would resume, but she said that would happen only if the company
can determine the chemical crowd-control agent is being handled
properly.
   There are no outstanding contracts to ship tear gas to Israel,
but Mrs. Alison said the Israelis wanted to buy more gas from
TransTechnology.
   Israel has bought 120,000 tear gas grenades or projectiles from
U.S. companies under the U.S. government's military sales program
since December.
   State Department officials have defended the sale of tear gas to
Israel on the grounds that it is an effective way of curbing
violent demonstrations. Alternative methods of controlling crowds
could be much more lethal, they say.
   Physicians for Human Rights, a Boston-based group, has expressed
concern that the Israelis may not be following proper handling
directions for tear gas, which overcomes victims by causing severe
irritation to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. The group has
called for more study into the effects of tear gas.
   If used correctly, the effects of tear gas are short-lived. But
the chemical agent can cause death, particularly to infants and the
elderly, if it is fired into enclosed spaces. There have been
reports the Israelis fired tear gas into a mosque and a hospital.

<HEAD>US Skeptical About French Claims On Hostage Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is expressing
skepticism about France's claim that no reward was given to Iran
for its help in the freeing of three French hostages from Lebanon.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that providing
rewards to hostage takers could prolong the ordeal of the remaining
18 hostages in Lebanon. Nine of those hostages are Americans.
   Redman also called on Iran on Friday to use its influence _
newly demonstrated this week _ over kidnappers in Lebanon to help
secure the release of the 18 captives.
   Both the French and Iranian governments acknowledged the Iranian
role in the releases of the three French hostages, Jean-Paul
Kauffmann, Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine.
   ``Once again this demonstrates the substantial influence Iran
holds over terrorist kidnappers,'' Redman said, adding that it is
not yet clear what prompted Iran to take the action it did.
   In any case, he said, ``We again call on Iran to exercise its
proven influence immediately to secure the release of the other
hostages still held in Lebanon.''
   France has denied that any money was paid for the hostages'
freedom, but Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has made vague
references to a bargain with Iran.
   Expressing doubts about the propriety of French actions, Redman
said: ``We've noted the French statements on the subject. We will
closely monitor future developments and we will be especially
sensitive to any actions which could be seen as rewarding the
taking of hostages.''
   Redman reaffirmed the longstanding U.S. view that the taking of
hostages should not be rewarded.
   ``Such behavior serves only to encourage more terrorism and
prolong the ordeal of other hostages, including the nine innocent
Americans.''
   Redman also disputed the contention of Peggy Say, sister of U.S.
hostage Terry Anderson, who said it almost appears that France
placed a higher priority on the lives of the French hostages than
the American government does on the lives of U.S. hostages.
   ``I would reject the notion that our government is less
concerned than any other government,'' Redman said.
   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. He was abducted on March 16, 1985, and has been
held longer than any other hostage in Lebanon.
   Redman said President Reagan ``reflected feelings of the entire
administration when he said that he shared the frustration of the
hostages' families.''
   ``They too are the victims of terrorism,'' he said. ``We are
deeply concerned about the hostages and are doing what we can to
obtain their release.''

   A little more than 3 percent of the 105,000
employees of the Agriculture Department nationwide will be checked
in the government's opening round of random drug testing among
federal workers.
   But Gerald Oakley of the department's Office of Finance and
Management said the 3,354 employees working at ``designated
positions'' in USDA will represent only the absolute minimum to be
tested initially.
   Under rules cleared by the Department of Health and Human
Services, the USDA program includes provisions that will allow
supervisors to request testing of workers under ``reasonable
suspicion'' of using drugs. Also, employees may voluntarily undergo
testing.
   The drugs listed by USDA in its testing program include
marijuana, cocaine, PCP, opiates and amphetamines. Officials
estimated the cost of the testing program at $1.6 million the first
year.
   Oakley and others said in interviews this week following the
unveiling of random drug testing plans by dozens of federal
agencies, that no serious objections have been raised so far by
USDA employee unions.
   ``Generally, the positions (to be tested) are high-level
employees or people with top-secret clearances, or people who have
special exposure _ at the U.S. borders or in security work,'' he
said. ``These people will be tested.''
   Oakley added: ``There might be others who might be tested, too.
We have no way of knowing, but I would think it would not be a very
large number.''
   Would a lone Forest Service employee in a fire tower be a
candidate for drug testing? Or a chicken inspector working in a
plant?
   ``Probably not, but it's possible, depending on whether the
Forest Service (or appropriate agency) selected the position as one
designated for testing,'' Oakley said. ``There was no intent to
pick a particular agency and focus on them.''
   High-level political appointees will not be exempt, not even
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng and his aides, if it is
determined those jobs should be checked out.
   Drug testing in some federal agencies will involve a much larger
percentage of their employees. At the Defense Department, for
example, as many as 20 percent may be tested eventually.
   The initial USDA testing of around 3 percent of its employees is
relatively low because the department has so few highly sensitive
jobs, at least not in the same league with the Pentagon, State or
the White House.
   But Oakley said USDA deals with ``certain economic security
factors'' such as massive crop reports that could have an impact on
the nation's economy if leaked prematurely. Details of new farm
programs are other examples.

   World sugar production in 1988-89 is forecast
at a record 104.1 million metric tons, up slightly from a revised
production of 103.6 million tons in 1987-88, the Agriculture
Department says.
   The department's first forecast for the coming year included
65.9 million tons of cane sugar, up 1 percent from 1987-88, and
38.2 million tons from sugar beets, down 1 percent.
   Tonnage was expressed in raw sugar equivalents. A metric ton is
about 2,205 pounds.
   According to the department's Foreign Agricultural Service,
which released the forecast, production in the European Economic
Community, which accounts for 13 percent of the global output, may
decline 2 percent in 1988-89 to about 13.8 million tons because of
``a return to more normal yields and a 1 percent decline in area to
be harvested.''
   Sugar production in the Soviet Union, the largest producer, was
forecast at 9.7 million tons, down 1 percent from last year's
revised output of 9.8 million tons.
   In Brazil, the third-ranking producer, production may be 8.4
million tons, down 1 percent from last season's revised total of
8.5 million tons, the report said.

<HEAD>EPA Regional Chief Urged Government To Drop North Atlantic Leasing
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has given
a qualified endorsement to a planned sale of offshore oil and gas
leases in the North Atlantic despite a top agency official's belief
that the 1989 sale should be scuttled.
   Michael R. Deland, the EPA's regional administrator for New
England, said in a memo released Friday by a leasing opponent that
the plan is ``environmentally unacceptable'' and that EPA should
urge the Interior Department to cancel or defer it.
   But EPA superiors in Washington overruled Deland and sent the
Interior Department a qualified endorsement of the planned February
sale _ for exploration only _ of 5.5 million acres off the
Northeast coast from Maine to New Jersey.
   Deland wrote in the May 3 memo: ``We find that the proposed
Lease Sale 96 is environmentally unacceptable because it places at
unnecessary risk a proven renewable fishery resource of national
and global biological and commercial value.''
   Deland echoed many of the same arguments stressed by
environmentalists and local New England officials who oppose
drilling on Georges Bank, a major fishing area off the New England
coast.
   He said the risks of a major oil spill or blowout from
exploration and production activities are much greater than
Interior Department officials have stated.
   The regional chief also noted the importance of Georges Bank's
$180 million-a-year fishing industry that accounts for about
one-fifth of the dollar value of all fish caught in the United
States.
   Congress has placed a leasing ban on the most fragile areas of
Georges Bank, but Deland warned that ``many highly sensitive areas
remain available for lease and thus exposed to the risks associated
with (offshore) oil and gas exploration and production.''
   Deland also quoted government estimates which say there is an 86
percent chance that no oil or gas would be found, a figure repeated
by environmentalists and illustrated by the limited industry
interest in the area in past years.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., author of the congressional
moratorium, released the memo Friday. He said he hopes to use
Deland's comments to convince Congress to expand the current
leasing ban to all of Georges Bank, a move he proposed for the
first time last week.
   Richard E. Sanderson, director of EPA's Office of Federal
Activities who sent the agency's final recommendation to Interior
officials this week, said the current lease plan poses ``almost no
environmental risk.'' And he pointed to New England's growing
energy needs.
   ``I just couldn't find a rationale to agree with him (Deland)
based on the mathematical evaluations,'' Sanderson said in a
telephone interview. ``The best technical data said there was
minimal to zero risk for exploration.''
   Sanderson added that the revised sale proposal is limited to
leases for exploration only. More risky full-scale production,
which the agency has concerns about, would require another level of
bureaucratic approval, he said.
   Studds, a leading opponent of Georges Bank drilling, said ``the
most knowledgeable senior official has been overruled by the
ideologues.''

   Workers wearing protective clothing and
carrying oxygen tanks found three bodies in the hot, twisted ruins
of a refinery Friday night, raising the death toll from the
explosion to six. One person was missing.
   ``The area is very much in disarray,'' said plant manager Fred
Foster. ``There are large pieces of equipment off of foundations
and down around the cat cracker. We're inching along. As time goes
on, it's going to slow down.''
   The catalytic cracking unit, used to break crude oil down into
usable products such as gasoline, was at the center of the blast
early Thursday at the Shell Oil Co. refinery. Forty-two people were
injured.
   The three bodies found Friday night were so badly burned they
could not immediately be identified, officials said. Two bodies
were found earlier Friday, and one was recovered shortly after the
blast.
   Foster said the air is still heavy with fumes and small fires
continued to burn, fed by oil and gas residue in the tangle of
pipes and equipment.
   Dean Perniciaro, president of the Oil Workers union local at the
plant, said Friday that he got a look at the blast area and could
barely recognize the site.
   ``There was an impact to virtually every building in the
facility. The area around the cat cracker is really tore up. The
fire continues around the cat cracker itself,'' he said.
   ``Some of the equipment is still recognizable, but an awful lot
of it has just collapsed into charred remains.''
   Shell spokesman Bill Gibson said Friday: ``The plant manager
visited the families (of the missing) last night. Afterward, he
said there wasn't much hope, but we're still hopeful, of course.''
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the
Environmental Protection Agency sent investigators to the plant
Friday to help in the search for the cause of the explosion.
   Chemical engineers said they could find no record of an
explosion by a catalytic cracker. ``There is no historical trend
for this event,'' said Norman Marsolan, professor of chemical
engineering at Louisiana Tech University.
   Houston Huckabay, chairman of Tech's chemical engineering
department, said he checked a list of 100 refinery fires dating
back to 1955 and found none of them involved a catalytic cracker.
   The 25-year-old, 16-story catalytic cracking unit produced
336,000 gallons of gasoline a day.
   Catalytic crackers were developed to support the nation's need
for high octane fuel after World War II.
   After gasoline is distilled from crude oil, the cracker provides
a second chance to get usable products from the remainder. A
chemical is mixed with the petroleum under heat to produce butane,
propane, more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel.
   Shell officials refused to speculate on how long the plant might
be idle, although Shell's adjacent chemical plant was expected to
resume operations quickly. Nor would they estimate the cost of the
damage.
   It could take as little as 18 months or as long as 27 months to
build a new one at a cost as high as $100 million, said Joseph
Vasilj, chief estimator at a Long Beach, Calif., company which
builds catalytic crackers.
   The bodies of Joey Poierrer, 28, of Reserve, and Ernie Carrillo,
44, of Kenner, were found Friday in the control room for the
gasoline-processing unit. The body of 20-year Shell employee Lloyd
Gregoire, 39, of Paulina, was found shortly after the explosion.

   An armored car driver stole $2.5 million
from the vehicle while two guards slept in the bunk section, the
FBI said Friday.
   The driver, Jared Layne Gray, 26, of Murray ``turned up missing
and hasn't been seen since,'' said Box Elder County Sheriff's
Detective Ken Adams.
   The theft, which occurred Thursday at a service station off
Interstate 15 in northern Utah, was reported by the other guards.
The money was being shipped from Boise, Idaho, to the Federal
Reserve Bank in Salt Lake City.
   FBI agent Don Kirby said the guards were asleep when the Wells
Fargo driver pulled off the freeway. After taking the money, he
apparently blocked the 38,000-pound truck's front doors, trapping
the guards inside, the agent said.
   The guards got the attention of the service station attendant,
who opened the door, said Kirby.
   Gray was charged in a federal complaint with embezzling.
   Wells Fargo Armored Service Corp. headquarters in Atlanta
referred calls to its parent company, Baker Industries of
Parsippany, N.J. A secretary said a spokesman had left for the day
and no other company officials could comment.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three fascinating dances and one very pretty
confection, all of them new, make up one of the programs of the New
York City Ballet's three-week American Music Festival.
   On Friday night, ``Space,'' choreographed by Laura Dean to music
by Steve Reich, received the most applause. A large corps de
ballet, dancing wonderfully, fills the stage space at the New York
State Theater. Sometimes their movement across the stage, by spins,
steps, kicks and spins, looks haphazard, while at other times the
dancers move in rows or groups of three.
   The four principals don't have major solos as in most ballets.
More often they dance around a square formed by a spotlight or
dance surrounded by the corps. Miss Dean, artistic director of
Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians since 1976, likes to have
individual dancers spin. In ``Space'' it was as hypnotic as the
music.
   Peter Martin's ``The Waltz Project'' shows a sure choreographic
hand. The music _ 13 waltzes, none traditional, by 13 composers _
is played by pianist Jerry Zimmerman.
   The first, danced by four couples, has broken, repeated phrases,
and many rests. Diana White seemed to swim on David Otto's hip in
Joan Tower's ``Red Garnet Waltz.'' Martins was particularly
inventive entwining Helene Alexopoulos and Jeppe Mydtskov _ though
it was more acrobatics than dancing _ to Philip Glass' ``Modern
Love Waltz.''
   Heather Watts and Jock Soto in leotards _ a sign that the ballet
will be very modern _ danced Richard Tanner's ``Sonatas and
Interludes.'' John Cage composed the music in 1960 for prepared
piano. Tanner, artistic director of the Pennsylvania Ballet since
1984, choreogaphed the ballet duet for the Eglevsky Ballet in 1982.
It's neoclassic at base, angular and interesting.
   The evening began with ``Woodland Sketches,'' choreographed by
Rogert La Fosse, company member since 1986, to nine tunes by Edward
McDowell. The first was his famous ``To a Wild Rose.'' The music is
sweetly old-fashioned and the dance and costumes depict romance at
the idyllic stage.

<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She's a grande dame who came from New
York to witness the last days of the historic Comstock Lode gold
rush that helped build the West.
   The crowned Lady Justice arrived in 1877, barefoot, robed,
scales in hand and serene eyes unobscured by the traditional
blindfold, to oversee a new $117,000 courthouse where miners came
to answer charges of trespassing, claim jumping, thieving and
murder.
   Now, for the first time in 111 years, the 7-foot symbol of
justice has left her second-floor perch overlooking Virginia City,
the historic mining town that attracts thousands of tourists each
year.
   She's getting a face and body lift to restore the golden-bronze
color and luster lost after her Nevada arrival, which coincided
with the last rich and glorious days of the Comstock Lode.
   ``We're not going to put a blindfold on her, though; That's the
best thing about her,'' said sculptor Greg Melton, who is doing the
restoration. ``I think I'm even starting to fall in love with her.
I'll have a hard time giving her back to Virginia City.''
   But Lady Justice wasn't always the object of affection, says Ron
James, a state historian.
   ``Underneath she was made of zinc, which is just about the
ugliest of metals,'' James said recently. ``Then she got to looking
really bad in the 1940s.
   ``They painted her with silver skin and a rust-colored robe.
Soon it was flaking off and she looked like a leper. One of her
scales even fell off. It was a shame because she really is
beautiful.''
   The statue is scheduled to be rededicated on May 15, taking her
place once again above the town that Mark Twain helped make famous
with his blend of fact and fiction as a reporter for the
Territorial Enterprise in the early 1860s.
   Melton, whose bronze statue of Comstock mining and engineering
pioneer Adolph Sutro stands beside the state capitol in Carson
City, will paint the Lady Justice an almost golden bronze color
just as she was originally.
   ``She had a lot of cracks and she'd been beat up because of
weather conditions,'' the 41-year-old sculptor said. ``She's in
pretty bad shape, but not bad enough that I can't fix her.
   ``I give the restoration a 100-year guarantee. If after 100
years it collapses I'll come back and fix it. I guarantee all my
work.''
   The Virginia City Justice is one of only about 20 statues in the
U.S. without a blindfold, according to James, who is deputy state
historic preservation officer.
   ``She was ordered from a catalog for $203 and she could be
picked with or without the blindfold; It was just a matter of
taste,'' James said. ``I guess the people in Virginia City thought
justice might be intrinsically better if she could see both sides.
It seems to make sense.''
   The Lady Justice was brought to Virginia City as part of an
ambitious rebuilding project after three-quarters of the town 25
miles southeast of Reno was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1875.
   ``The city fathers were faced with the question of what to do
with the community after the fire,'' James said. ``They chose to
rebuild it in grand style.
   The state Comstock Historic District Commission, which James
oversees, is paying $2,800 for the restoration. The hollow statue
will be filled with ``letters to the future'' as a sort of time
capsule.
   James said people will be charged $25 to have a single-page
letter placed inside the Lady Justice. The money will go toward the
restoration of another historic project, the 111-year-old Fourth
Ward School in Virginia City.
   ``I hope she'll turn out just like when she was first put up,''
James said. ``She'll look at the sunrise each day and shine like
she used to. She deserves it.''

<HEAD>Life's A Challenge For Suicide Survivor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Polfreyman expected to die in 1980 when
he tucked the muzzle of a rifle under his chin and pulled the
trigger. But the bullet he hoped would obliterate his life instead
gave it new meaning.
   ``Life's now a challenge for me. I find happiness in a
challenge,'' said Polfreyman, who was blinded and disfigured by the
suicide attempt.
   The bullet severed his optic nerve, tore his lips and facial
cartilage, ripped his cheeks away and destroyed his sinuses and
palate. That it did not hit his brain before exiting between his
eyes he attributes to a ``higher power.''
   Today, Polfreyman, 25, is working on a history teaching degree
at Weber State College here, where his lanky figure is a familiar
sight as he strides across campus with Handy, his seeing-eye dog,
and Kris Porter, his girlfriend. Polfreyman hopes to work with
handicapped students after he graduates.
   ``I'm in a world that to me is so much nicer,'' he said. ``I see
people for who they are, not for what they have on. I see their
heart. A person is so much nicer when seen from the heart.''
   The world Polfreyman saw while growing up was not so nice. His
parents separated when he was in 10th grade, and living with his
father didn't work out.
   Handsome, artistic and above-average in intelligence, he was
bored, rambunctious and rebellious. ``If I was told by an authority
figure to do something, I'd do the opposite,'' he said.
   Jean Elmer, Polfreyman's mother, has remarried and lives in
Knightstown, Ind. She remembers that when she complained about her
son's grades, he vowed to make the honor roll. He did, but the
challenge was gone and he lapsed back to C's and D's. And he drank.
   ``I don't remember a lot of high school from being drunk,'' he
said.
   Polfreyman, the eldest of four boys, said his family was unaware
of his inner turmoil.
   Polfreyman lived in Denver for a time and in a foster home back
in Utah. During his senior year in high school he fought often,
hurting three students ``pretty bad,'' and eventually dropped out,
he said.
   ``One morning I woke up and decided I had lost complete control
of my life and there was no way I could go back,'' he said. ``I
didn't have a challenge in life or a goal that was not achievable.
It was too easy.''
   Deciding suicide was his only option, he left home to spend his
last week with friends in Denver. A note left for his mother said
simply, ``Mom, I've got something important to do. I love you.''
   When he ran out of money he drove to a field outside the city.
He wrote another note.
   ``I'm sorry for what I'm about to do,'' he wrote. ``(But) I
didn't die sad. I was quite happy.''
   A former Vietnam War medic just happened to be in the same field
trying out a new Jeep. He administered first aid and used his CB
radio to call for help.
   Polfreyman survived. His first conscious thought was that he was
blind. ``It was a peaceful feeling,'' he said.
   ``After I got out of the hospital I tried to find God to thank
him,'' said Polfreyman, who first became active in the Mormon
Church of his youth and later became a Seventh-day Adventist. ``I
am very much into what I call a higher power.''
   Adjusting to life without sight was difficult, but emotional
adjustments took even longer.
   ``The boy I used to call Johnny died,'' Mrs. Elmer said. ``The
boy who lives now I call JT. They're nothing alike. JT is more
independent and self-motivated. Johnny was more loving. He needed
love and gave more.''
   Polfreyman endured some 20 operations to restore his face,
several of which failed. Bone from his ankle was used to rebuild
his nose, but a four-inch depression in the left side of his
forehead remains, and now is covered by curly brown hair. Infection
forced doctors to remove a plate they had implanted over the spot.
   His cheeks, however, defied doctors' expectations and grew back.
   Mother and son attribute divine intervention to his survival and
the ``little miracles'' that have shaped his recovery.
   ``He has so much to give now that he didn't before,'' said Mrs.
Elmer. ``Only because he didn't know he had it.''

<HEAD>Quotes From the Presidential Campaign Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, on whether Attorney General Edwin Meese is a
campaign liability: ``I know him well, favorably, but I must say I
am troubled by some of the allegations. I think fair play dictates
that the system go forward and make the determination.''
   
   BUSH, speaking at a Republican dinner in Nebraska about
Democrats Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis: ``It's a pleasure to
be here. And I'll be back. And I'm not going to be out-hustled by
the hustler from Chicago or from that traditional liberal Democrat
from Massachusetts.''
   
   MARLIN FITZWATER, White House spokesman, saying it was
courageous for Bush to refrain from making recommendations to
President Reagan during cabinet meetings:``He has for the first
time in history defined the vice presidency in a way that is
meaningful to the president and has made it the confidential
adviser that I think is very important; and I suspect future vice
presidents will want to follow that mold.''
   
   BILL CLINTON, governor of Arkansas, coalescing with five
governors of mostly Western states in endorsing Michael Dukakis for
the Democratic presidential nomination: ``Gov. Dukakis has emerged
as the voters' choice, the clear leader in the Democratic
nomination process. It is time for the party leadership to unite
behind his candidacy.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, on front-runner Dukakis and other obstacles that
he says stand between himself and the Democratic nomination:``The
press, the pundits, the party, the candidate _ it's not just me and
him; it's me and them.''

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE death toll to nine with
discovery of three more bodies in Norco, La. Picks up graf 5, The
accidents...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As the death toll from three industrial disasters rose to nine
Friday, company and union leaders and government officials debated
the safety of the refinery, skyscraper and chemical plant damaged
or destroyed by flames or explosions.
   An explosion with earthquake force Wednesday flattened the
Pacific Engineering Production Co., a maker of ammonium perchlorate
for rocket fuel, and a neighboring marshmallow plant in Henderson,
Nev., killing two people and injuring more than 300 people.
   That night, fire broke out at the 62-story First Interstate Bank
building in downtown Los Angeles and quickly enveloped four floors
of the state's tallest skyscraper. One worker died when he was
trapped in an elevator, and 40 people were injured, authorities
said.
   Early Thursday, explosions set off fires at a Shell Oil Co.
refinery in Norco, La. Six people were found dead, and one was
still missing Friday, according to Shell. Forty-two people were
injured as windows shattered and doors and roofs were torn off
throughout Norco.
   The accidents triggered talk about fire prevention and
firefighting in high-rise towers, handling volatile chemicals and
how to protect neighbors of potentially hazardous operations.
   The United Steelworkers of America entered the debate in Nevada,
releasing a 1982 letter from a union safety and health technician
who called Pacific Engineering plant ``one of the worst I have ever
been into.'' USW Local 4856 represents workers at the plant.
   On Friday, USW President Lynn Williams issued a statement
denouncing the company and the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration for not acting on the union's complaints.
   But the company's chairman, Fred Gibson, maintained it had a
good record, and state officials generally supported him.
   Jim Barnes, state Industrial Relations director, said Pacific
Engineering underwent 11 inspections by the state Occupational
Safety and Health Division over five years. The inspections
resulted in 10 citations, and four fines for incidents he termed
serious.
   ``There have been problems from time to time, mostly minor,'' he
said. ``Our opinion is that overall their record has been a good,
moderate record.''
   The disaster raised worries about a Kerr-McGee Corp. plant a
mile away which is the only other facility in the United States to
manufacture ammonium perchlorate. The plant shut down voluntarily
after the blast until more is known about what caused it.
   ``We will not resume until we're absolutely certain it's safe,''
Kerr-McGee spokesman Paul Reed said Friday. ``But we've been
operating 35 years without any sort of accident. We think our plant
safety record is exemplary.''
   On Friday, Kerr-McGee executives met with city officials amid
calls from frightened residents to shut the facility down
permanently.
   ``We've created a monster of fear,'' said Henderson City
Councilman Michael Harris. ``I don't think anybody other than maybe
some of those that really knew the plants knew the potential hazard
inside.''
   But he said: ``It's too early to say we're going to run
Kerr-McGee out of town. We have to wait and find out what caused
this. It may create a tremendous war out here.''
   In Los Angeles, there was talk of extending the city's
requirement that high-rises built after 1974 have sprinkler systems
to older buildings like the 1973 First Interstate tower, as well.
   As many as two-thirds of the city's 765 skyscrapers lack
sprinklers, according to fire officials, and City Councilman Nate
Holden said he will propose a law requiring the systems in all
high-rises, buildings taller than 75 feet or six or seven stories.
   Managers of most of the 521 high-rises built before 1974 haven't
opted for expensive ``retrofitting'' with sprinklers and other
safety gear, said Assistant Fire Chief David Parsons. First
Interstate was installing a $3.5 million sprinkler system, but it
wasn't quite completed.
   Fire officials Friday called in investigators of the federal
Bureau Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to assist in determining the
cause of the blaze, estimated to have done $450 million damage.
Their help was requested because of the severity and scale of the
blaze, said Assistant Fire Chief Peter Lucarelli, not necessarily
because arson is suspected.
   Bob Campbell, a spokesman for First Interstate Bancorp,
discounted arson speculation prompted by news that 100 workers on
the floor where the fire reportedly broke out might lose their jobs
because their division was just sold.
   In Louisiana, OSHA sent investigators to the damaged Shell
refinery Friday to help determine the cause of the explosion at the
catalytic cracker, which chemical engineers called highly unusual.
   Houston Huckabay, chairman of Tech's chemical engineering
department, said he checked a list of 100 refinery fires dating
back to 1955 and found none of them involved a catalytic cracker,
used to break down crude oil into usable products such as gasoline.
   And there had never been a fatal accident at the sprawling Shell
refinery, which had prided itself on its safety record.
   ``Until the accident yesterday, the plant had gone 5.5 million
work hours without a lost-time accident,'' said Fred Foster, plant
manager.
   A fire in April 1985 caused some injuries and shut the plant
down until it was extinguished, but nobody was evacuated from
Norco, and the plant was back in business quickly, he said.
   Dean Perniciaro, president of Local 4750, Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Union, said Friday that the safety record made
Thursday's explosion hard to believe.
   ``I guess it shows we're just not immune to disasters,'' he said.

   The Associated Press today will transmit an initial list of
delegates to the Democratic National Convention July 18-21 in
Atlanta.
   This list will include information on more than 1,000 of the
4,161 delegates to the convention.
   This partial list, which is compiled by the Democratic National
Committee, contains information only on those delegates whose
selection has been certified by the party and who are not under
challenge.
   The Democratic Party will be providing weekly updates to the
delegate list, noting the addition of delegates, as well as
corrections to previous records and which delegates, if any, should
be deleted from previous lists.
   These lists will be moved as weekly installments. Because of the
overall bulk of material involved, the AP does not plan to move a
cumulative list of the delegates at some later date. Consequently,
we suggest that you make arrangements with your Saturday staff
members to save this material as it is moved.
   For each delegate, the list will give the last name, first name,
sex, race, initial presidential preference, public office title (if
any), city, state, office telephone number (if any), convention
committee assignment (if any), and delegate type (e.g.,
congressional district, automatic, at large)
   The Democratic Party is providing this material electronically
to the AP. The Republican Party has not determined whether its
computers can produce similar electronic lists for wire
transmission.
   The initial run from the Democrats is estimated to take at least
20 takes of about 1,000 words each.
   The lists will be slugged BC-Democratic Delegates-List.
   The material will begin moving late this morning on a deferred
priority.

<HEAD>Pittsburgh Mayor Dies of Rare Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri, the city's chief
executive for more than a decade, died of heart failure at age 56
on the day he was scheduled to meet with doctors to discuss a
possible heart transplant.
   ``He was the kindest of men and always thought the best of
others,'' said City Council President Sophie Masloff, 70, who was
sworn in as mayor Friday about seven hours after Caliguiri's death.
   Mrs. Masloff, a Democrat, becomes the city's first woman mayor.
She will complete Caliguiri's term, which expires in January 1990,
and retain her council seat. She said she would carry out
Caliguiri's policies.
   Meanwhile, friends, associates and even former political foes of
the late mayor praised him Friday.
   Gov. Robert Casey ordered flags on state property flown at
half-staff Friday and called the late mayor ``a vibrant force for
the good of our people, our state and our nation.''
   ``His death is a tragic loss, not only to the family he loved so
deeply, but to the city that has been his life's work,'' said U.S.
Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers, which is
based in Pittsburgh, described Caliguiri as ``a man of vision and
compassion'' who was ``committed to efforts to revitalize the many
communities in this region that have been buffeted by economic
turmoil.''
   One of Caliguiri's frequent adversaries, Councilwoman Michelle
Madoff, said she remained a friend of the mayor despite their
disagreements and added, ``He didn't have a mean bone in his body.''
   The mayor's wife, Jeanne, called for an ambulance just after
midnight Friday when she noticed her husband was pale and she could
not awaken him, said Dr. James O'Toole, Caliguiri's cardiologist.
   Paramedics worked for 1{ hours to resuscitate him, but the mayor
never regained consciousness and was declared dead at Shadyside
Hospital at 1:36 a.m., officials said.
   Caliguiri, a popular Democrat, suffered from amyloidosis, a rare
disorder that deposits protein in the heart, kidneys and other
major organs. The deposits stiffened his heart. Doctors inserted a
pacemaker to stabilize an irregular heart beat in December and were
considering a transplant.
   A meeting had been planned Friday ``to discuss the timing'' of a
possible transplant, said Dr. Joel Weinberg, one of the mayor's
physicians.
   Caliguiri went to work Thursday, and though he was visibly
growing weaker, doctors, friends and colleagues said his death was
unexpected.
   ``We would have expected a slightly more gradual downhill
course,'' O'Toole said.
   Caliguiri was sworn in April 10, 1977. He is credited with
helping shift Pittsburgh from its dependence on the steel industry
to a progressive, technically oriented city of 365,000 people. The
turnaround earned Pittsburgh national recognition.
   Caliguiri became a director of the Pittsburgh Pirates through
his efforts to keep the major league baseball team in the city
after it was offered for sale three years ago. A consortium of
business leaders bought the team in 1985, ensuring it would remain
for at least five years.
   The Pirates saluted Caliguiri in a brief memorial before Friday
night's home game. Church bells also were rung throughout the city
at 7 p.m. in honor of the late mayor.
   In addition to his wife, Caliguiri is survived by two sons.
   Visitors will be received at H. Samson Funeral Home tonight and
Sunday. The mayor's body then will be moved to the City County
Building for a viewing Monday.
   Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated Tuesday morning at
St. Paul's Cathedral. Burial will be private. The site was not
disclosed.

   An explosion ripped through a downtown Kuwait
complex that houses airlines offices early Saturday and appeared to
have caused considerable damage, residents said.
   It could not immediately be determined whether there were any
injuries in the 7:23 a.m. (12:23 a.m. EDT) explosion, which
occurred about an hour before offices open.
   At least one ambulance was heard rushing in the direction of the
blast, which was a block away from offices of Saudi Arabia's
national airlines that were bombed less that two weeks ago.
   That explosion, which the government said was caused by a time
bomb, injured a guard and severely damaged the ground-floor offices.
   Kuwait, the country closest ot the Iran-Iraq war front, has in
recent months been the target of several such bombings _ and a
hijacking.
   The incidents are widely believed to have been masterminded by
Iran, which accuses Kuwait of aiding Iraq in their 7{-year-old war.

<DATELINE>ROARING SPRING, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion at a pulp and paper mill
Friday spewed chemical fumes that prompted the evacuation of all
2,600 residents of this town, authorities said. Forty people were
treated for respiratory problems.
   The blaze erupted about 10 p.m. in the boiler room of the
Appleton Papers Inc. plant in this central Pennsylvania community,
said Bob Kerns, fire coordinator for the Blair County Emergency
Management Service. The fire was brought under control by midnight.
   ``My windows shook like a stick of dynamite went off when the
thing blew up,'' said Mary Ann Bathurst, who lives near the plant.
   No serious injuries were reported. But about 40 people,
including one mill worker, were treated for respiratory problems at
Nason Hospital in Roaring Spring, which was not evacuated because
of its safe distance from the plant, Kerns said.
   Residents were asked to leave their homes as a precautionary
measure because of a chemical odor. Some people were complaining of
a burning sensation in their lungs, watery eyes and shortness of
breath, according to Terry Dellinger, assistant police chief in
Roaring Spring.
   Dellinger said authorities were not certain whether the chemical
was released in the flames or leaked out afterward. The cause of
the fire and the extent of damages at the plant were not
immediately known.
   ``Hopefully, a breeze will come by and blow it all away,''
Dellinger said.
   Kerns identified the chemical as diphenyl oxide, a toxic and
highly flammable substance used to heat the boilers at the plant.
   Evacuated residents were taken to Central High School in nearby
Martinsburg. Some went to the homes of family or friends.
   ``It's very hectic down here right now,'' Principal Sam Ebersole
said from the high school.
   Cots were set up in the high school's cafeteria, gymnasium and
auditorium, according to Ebersole.
   ``The word here is that we'll be here all night,'' he said.

   On the eve of Sunday's presidential runoff,
Socialist leaders claimed politics had a role in the freeing this
week of Frenchmen held captive in Lebanon and New Caledonia. Still,
the releases brought joy.
   Campaigning is prohibited today.
   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand and Conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac staged final rallies Friday in the south.
   Chirac basked in the release in Beirut Wednesday after three
years in captivity of Marcel Fontaine, 45, Marcel Carton, 62, and
Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, and in the freeing Thursday of 23 French
lawmen held by Melanesian separatists in New Caledonia.
   The release from exile Friday of a French spy convicted in the
1985 sinking of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior was another
dose of good news for Chirac supporters.
   It wasn't clear how the hostage releases would affect Chirac's
chances in the runoff, because polls are forbidden in the final
week of the campaign. Most political analysts felt any benefits
would be insufficient to overcome the wide lead held by Mitterrand
in the final opinion surveys last week.
   Mitterrand, seeking a second seven-year term, said he welcomed
the hostage releases and made no insinuations about his opponent.
   But Lionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party,
claimed Friday that Chirac ``and his team is working public opinion
with force in a formidable attempt to manipulate the end of the
campaign.''
   Chirac rejected allegations that his actions were motivated by
the elections. He said it was ``my duty to do everything possible,
even if it could lead to critical comments, to get the last
(French) hostages out of Lebanon.''
   Jacques Toubon, secretary-general of Chirac's Rally for the
Republic party, denounced what he called the ``wet blankets, the
grumblers who split hairs when they should simply be happy.''
   The last polls indicated Mitterrand was favored by 53 percent to
57 percent of voters, compared to Chirac's 43 percent to 47 percent
rating.
   The men advanced to the runoff by being the top two vote-getters
in the first round of voting April 24. In that vote, Mitterrand won
34.1 percent of the vote and Chirac received 19.9 percent.
   Mitterrand named Chirac premier in 1986 after the Conservatives
and an allied party won a slim majority in the National Assembly.
   In Paris' central Place de la Concorde, 40,000 Chirac backers
gathered Friday for a final outpouring of support.
   ``France needs a president who decides,'' Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua told the crowd. ``When it was necessary to decide
for the liberation of hostages in Lebanon, Chirac knew how to
decide. When it was necessary to decide to free the hostages in New
Caledonia, Chirac knew how to decide.''
   On Thursday morning, French security forces stormed a cave in
the French island territory of New Caledonia, freeing 23 hostages.
Two assault team members and 19 Melanesian separatist kidnappers
were killed.
   On Friday, the government announced that Capt. Dominique Prieur,
one of two French agents convicted in New Zealand of the 1985
bombing of an anti-nuclear Greenpeace ship, had been allowed to
leave her island exile for France.
   Chirac said she was freed because she is pregnant.
   Ms. Prieur and the other agent, who has already returned to
France, were convicted of manslaughter in the bombing, which killed
a photographer aboard the Rainbow Warrior.
   Ten-year New Zealand prison terms for the two were suspended
under a U.N.-sponsored agreement provided the two remained in exile
on a French Pacific atoll.
   New Zealand complained that the return to France violated
international law.
   The left-leaning newspaper Le Monde said it was difficult to
believe that Mrs. Prieur's condition required that she be brought
back to France just 48 hours before the election.

<HEAD>D'Amato Says Biaggi Wasn't Reason He Helped Wedtech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato says his intercession with
the Pentagon on behalf of Wedtech Corp. had nothing to do with Rep.
Mario Biaggi, although the congressman had asked him to lobby for
the company.
   D'Amato, called as a prosecution witness at the federal
racketeering trial of Biaggi and six others Friday, conceded that
he or his staff wrote and called Army and Small Business
Administration officials on behalf of Wedtech, a now-bankrupt
defense contractor in the South Bronx.
   D'Amato, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, also said
Biaggi, D-N.Y., had contacted him as many as eight times on
Wedtech's behalf.
   But under questioning by Biaggi's defense lawyer, the New York
Republican said he felt Wedtech was being treated unfairly and, at
the time, thought he was helping a local business in an
economically deprived area.
   ``And you would have done that if you never met Mario Biaggi?''
asked the lawyer, James LaRossa.
   ``That is correct,'' said D'Amato.
   Prosecutors charge that Biaggi, a Bronx Democrat, extorted cash
and stock from Wedtech in return for his influence on Capitol Hill.
The government contends that Biaggi, working through his former law
partner Bernard Ehrlich, enlisted D'Amato and the late Rep. Joseph
Addabbo, a powerful Queens Democrat, to help Wedtech obtain no-bid
defense contracts.
   Asked if he would have helped Wedtech if he knew Biaggi held
stock in the company, D'Amato replied, ``I don't know. I think it
would've given me pause to reflect. I just don't know.''
   D'Amato said he appointed Ehrlich, formerly a general in the New
York National Guard, as his unpaid military consultant and hired
Ehrlich's daughter as a press aide.
   D'Amato also testified that he arranged a White House meeting
through a top aide of then-presidential counselor Edwin Meese among
Army, SBA and Wedtech officials to help Wedtech obtain a
multimillion dollar small engine contract. The Army had been
opposed to giving Wedtech the contract.
   Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J.M. Little if Wedtech
got the Army contract after that meeting, D'Amato replied,
``Essentially, yes.''
   On cross examination by LaRossa, D'Amato said that his office
prided itself on helping constituent companies cut through red
tape. He also said he assisted Wedtech because he believed the
company was not being treated fairly by the Army.
   Later, D'Amato said under questioning by Little that the only
other time Biaggi had sought his assistance on behalf of a military
contractor was for a Brooklyn ship repair company, Coastal Dry Dock
and Repair Corp.
   Biaggi's involvement with Coastal Dry Dock led to his conviction
last year for taking an unlawful gratuity. Biaggi, who was
sentenced to 30 months, is free pending appeal.
   Prosecutors contend Biaggi, Ehrlich and some of the other
defendants helped Wedtech illegally obtain SBA approval to
participate in a program that set aside no-bid government contracts
for minority-controlled businesses.
   There are no allegations of wrongdoing by Addabbo.

<HEAD>British Air Force Helicopter Crashes; Two Killed, Seven Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British air force helicopter
taxiing at an air show hit a loading ramp and burst into flames,
killing two people and seriously injuring at least seven, officials
said.
   Air show visitors ran for cover Friday after the rear rotor of a
U.S.-made Chinook helicopter crashed into the ramp about 15 feet
above the ground.
   ``It was like a bad dream, like a bomb went off,'' said a woman
who identified herself as Caren Niewisch, 27, of Los Angeles.
``Panic broke out. People fell and tried to get away.''
   The crash set off several explosions aboard the helicopter,
officials said.
   One explosion blew off one of the legs of a British soldier
guiding the helicopter to its parking position, the Royal Air Force
said.
   The two who died and three of the injured were aboard the
helicopter, airport officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``numerous others'' on the ground had slighter injuries from flying
debris.
   British military officials were investigating the accident. The
helicopter was based in an air base at Guetersloh, about 65 miles
southwest of Hanover.
   Ms. Niewisch said she had come to the air show with a man who
identified himself as Marcus Fontaine, also of Los Angeles.
   The couple escaped without injuries.
   Fontaine, who said he was a pilot, said he believed the accident
was not caused by pilot error.
   ``It wasn't the pilot's fault,'' he said. ``The man on the
ground underestimated the radius of the rotor blades in the turn.''
   Officials said flames shot up more than 25 feet in the air and
it took fire crews more than 30 minutes to extinguish the blaze.
   The accident occurred shortly after the day's air show
activities had concluded, but crowds were milling around the
exhibitions, officials said.
   More than 420 exhibitors from 16 countries are participating in
the air show, which opened Wednesday.

<HEAD>Beijing Women Want Two Children, In Defiance Of Government Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of five married women in Beijing want
two or more children despite the government policy limiting each
couple to only one child, according to a survey released today.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said a survey of 7,539 married
women in the Beijing area found that two-thirds wanted two children
and 13.8 percent wanted three or more. It said just 19.9 percent
were satisfied with one child.
   The survey was conducted by the Beijing Statistics Bureau
   Of those women who already have a child, 58.5 percent surveyed
said they had agreed to respect the one couple-one child policy,
while 24.4 percent have not decided and 12.1 percent do not want to
comply.
   China adopted its one-child policy at the beginning of the 1980s
in an attempt to limit its population, now at 1.07 billion, to 1.2
billion by the year 2000.
   The policy has been generally successful in urban areas, where
there are housing shortages and most women have jobs.
   But the one-child concept has made little headway in the more
conservative countryside, where couples want boys to take care of
them in their old age and children to help out on the farm.
   Many rural couples, enriched by economic reforms that have
brought back family farming, have little difficulty in paying off
fines imposed for having more than one child.
   Population experts now say relaxed attitudes toward family
planning and the fact that couples from the baby-boom generation of
the 1960s are now starting their own families have pushed
population growth beyond acceptable levels and made the target for
the year 2000 impossible to achieve.

<TEXT>
   An educator withdrew his name from
consideration for president of North Dakota State University on
Friday night after admitting he lifted part of a presentation for
the job from a magazine article.
   Richard Sauer, acting president of the University of Minnesota,
conceded he failed to credit the article in the speech given at
NDSU in Fargo, N.D., on Monday but said he had not been trying to
claim authorship.
   He called William C. Nelson, chairman of the NDSU presidential
search committee, to say he was withdrawing from consideration,
Nelson said.
   ``I think he felt the controversy had gotten to the point that
it would make it difficult for him to be an effective president at
NDSU,'' Nelson said. ``I urged him to stay, to keep his name in for
the running for the presidency. But I was unsuccessful in changing
his mind.''
   The 48-year-old Sauer, vice president of agriculture, forestry
and home economics at University of Minnesota before becoming
interim president in March, did not immediately return a telephone
call Friday night.
   At issue was a speech to several hundred professors, faculty and
students at an open forum for the NDSU presidential candidate.
   NDSU history professor Larry R. Peterson said he recognized part
of the speech as being nearly identical to points made by Cornell
University President Frank Rhodes in a guest column in the May 22,
1985, edition of the Chronicle of Higher Education. He said he had
saved a copy because he was impressed with Rhodes' list of what
graduates should get out of a college education.
   ``At first, I just couldn't believe it,'' Peterson said. ``It's
insulting, I guess. It's like here's someone trying to put
something over on us.''
   He said he forwarded the information to the presidential search
committee.
   But the committee on Thursday recommended Sauer and three other
to the North Dakota Board of Higher Education after accepting
Sauer's explanation that he accidentally omitted the credit in
trying to shorten his speech, Nelson said.
   ``There wasn't any question that he did use a small portion of
that (speech),'' Nelson said. ``But the other factor is the intent.
The majority of the committee felt there was no intent on his
behalf.''
   ``I don't normally make citations in oral presentations of that
nature because they interrupt the flow of the talk. But I wasn't
trying to claim any credit for authorship,'' Sauer said earlier in
explaining the speech.
   ``It was probably very close to verbatim,'' he said.
   University of Minnesota regents chairman David Lebedoff said
Friday night he could not comment because he knew nothing about the
situation. Sauer became acting president after Kenneth Keller
resigned in a controversy over spending.
   Nelson said the North Dakota Board of Higher Education plans to
meet May 22-23 to make its decision. The school's former president,
Laurel Loftsgard, died last year.

<HEAD>Winter Heat: A Tiny Saving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heating costs averaged $648.54 per household
last winter, the government reports.
   The figure is 56 cents below normal for the winter, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its seasonal climate
impact summary.
   The summary, released Friday, estimated Americans spent a total
of $46.6 billion on heating from October through April. That total
was $40 million less than would have been expected if winter
conditions had been the same as the average of the last 20 years.
   Households with oil heat spent about $4 more during the winter
than normal, but that was balanced by savings for those using gas
and electricity for heat, the NOAA climatologists reported.
   Costs varied considerably from place to place, depending on
region.
   Here is a regional rundown of the winter season heating cost for
a typical home, and the difference from what would be been expected
in average winter conditions:
   _Middle Atlantic: $892.86, $6.35 more than normal. Includes New
York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   _New England: $795.12, $4.88 more than normal. Includes Maine,
Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
   _East North Central: $749.63, $2.92 above normal. Includes
Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   _East South Central: $671.05, $10.53 above normal. Includes
Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama.
   _West North Central: $626.42, $7.55 below normal. Includes North
Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and
Missouri.
   _Mountain: $608.57, $17.14 below normal. Includes Montana,
Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico.
   _South Atlantic: $584.07, $12.39 above normal. Includes
Maryland, Delaware, District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.
   _West South Central: $419.18, $8.22 above normal. Includes
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana.
   _Pacific: $400.00, $29.52 below normal. Includes Washington,
Oregon and California.
   The climate impact assessments do not include heating cost
estimates for Alaska or Hawaii.

<HEAD>Martens Asked To Form New Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Baudouin has asked outgoing Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens to form a new center-left coalition
government to help ease the nation's linguistic squabbles and
economic problems.
   Martens, 52, a Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat, met Friday
with the king and later with leaders of the coalition's five
parties in hopes of this weekend forming Belgium's 35th government
since World War II.
   The next government's key task will be to change the
constitution to make this nation of 5.5 million Dutch and 4.5
million French-speakers a federated state with more autonomy for
its diverse regions.
   Other difficulties facing the nation include an 11 percent
jobless rate _ among the highest in the European Economic Community.
   It was expected that Martens would head the five-party alliance,
which is comprised of Christian Democrats and Socialists, each
split into Dutch- and French-speaking camps, and the Flemish
nationalist party Volksunie.
   The five political leaders agreed this week on a government
program after months of negotiations. It was endorsed Thursday by
the congresses of their parties.
   The parties will command 150 of the 212 legislative seats, more
than the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution and
grant more powers of autonomy to Flanders, Belgium's Dutch-speaking
northern half, and French-speaking Wallonia.
   Constitutional reforms would give Flanders and Wallonia direct
elections for their parliaments and make Brussels, which officially
is bilingual, a separate region.
   Martens' center-right coalition _ his sixth government since
1979 _ fell in a linguistic dispute Oct. 19.
   That was followed by inconclusive Dec. 13 elections. Martens'
government has since served in a caretaker capacity.

<HEAD>Fire In Wright's Office Touches Off Debate Over Capitol Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $120,000 fire in the office of House Speaker
Jim Wright has sparked a debate over the safety of congresssional
buildings.
   Elliott Carroll, executive assistant to Capitol Architect George
M. White, said Friday that the congressional buildings are made of
stone and brick and are ``as safe as any place in the world.''
   But Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a former fire chief whose office is
next to Wright's, says there should be stricter fire safety
standards for all federal buildings.
   The issue came up after a small electrical fire Thursday evening
damaged a kitchenette in the office of Wright, D-Texas, in the
Longworth House Office Building.
   The fire broke out about 6 p.m. on the second-floor suite that
houses Wright's district staff in a building across the street from
the Capitol. Carroll said the fire started in a copying machine in
the kitchenette.
   Weldon complained Thursday night and Friday morning that the
fire, which lasted 10 minutes, could have been contained more
quickly had there been fire hoses in hall cabinets and alarms in
the offices.
   Weldon said the fire points to the need for Congress and the
federal government to come under the national fire standards that
govern the buildings of private industry.
   ``We need one set of standards, all over,'' Weldon told
reporters. ``The federal government should accept no federal
standards less than they require of private businesses downtown.''
   He said the Longworth building lacks closed stairways, fire
alarms and smoke detectors in addition to fire hoses.
   Carroll denied that Congress had once again exempted itself from
legislation it has passed for everyone else in the nation, such as
the civil rights, occupational safety and health and minimum wage
laws.
   He said the congressional complex is exempt from District of
Columbia fire regulations, not by a law but because all federal
buildings are exempt from local fire codes.
   However, he said, the Capitol Hill buildings would meet the D.C.
code and they ``meet and exceed'' the national standard.
   Carroll also said the architect's office has begun a $47.5
million modernization program to make the buildings safer against
fire, especially with the installation of voice fire alarms and
smoke detectors.
   ``All these buildings are fireproof,'' said Carroll. ``The
modernization program will make them safer.''
   Weldon remained unconvinced, saying he would move as quickly as
possible to enact legislation to require that fire safety standards
apply to all federal buildings.
   ``It should come quickly,'' he said. ``It's a wonder the
government hasn't been caught with its pants down previously.''

<BYLINE>Bush Refers To Jackson As ``Hustler From Chicago''
^By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush wound up three days of campaigning in
the West by referring to Democrat Jesse Jackson as a ``hustler from
Chicago'' and saying he was ``troubled by some of the allegations''
against Attorney General Edwin Meesee III.
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis, meanwhile, added to his
``super delegate'' totals by picking up the endorsement of six
Democratic governors. Jackson was crisscrossing California in
pursuit of the 314 delegates at stake in the season-ending primary
June 7.
   ``I'm not going to be out-hustled by the hustler from Chicago or
from that traditional liberal Democrat from Massachusetts,'' Bush
told a group of Republicans during a stop in Lincoln, Neb., on
Friday.
   The all-but-certain Republican nominee, making a clear reference
to Jackson, who has a home in Chicago, and the Massachusetts
governor, also promised he'd be back.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart said there was ``nothing
derogatory'' in Bush's comments. The vice president ``was talking
about how hard he (Jackson) has hustled,'' said Hart.
   ``Bush is just trying to sound tough,'' said Jackson as he left
a fund-raiser in San Francisco. ``He's petrified at the thought of
having to face me in a series of debates. So he's already whining.
   ``I do not know the context of his statement, but that type of
name-calling is beneath the dignity of the vice president of this
country.''
   In an effort to head off the controversy that plagued him during
the New York primary, the first in a recent series of 2-1 Dukakis
primary victories, Jackson has set a May 18 meeting with about 100
Jewish leaders in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis gained the endorsements of the six governors while he
took a break from campaigning to handle some statehouse business in
Boston and have a private weekend with his wife, Kitty.
   The endorsement was announced by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who
has been mentioned as a possible running mate for Dukakis.
   Clinton said he and the other five governors _ Cecil Andrus of
Idaho, Steve Cowper of Alaska, Ted Schwinden of Montana, George
Sinner of North Dakota and Michael Sullivan of Wyoming _ had
withheld their endorsements until now to avoid the appearance of a
stop-Jackson movement.
   Dukakis also got signals from from Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, a
former astronaut and himself a 1984 presidential candidate, that he
was available as a running mate if Dukakis wanted him. Glenn said
he was not campaigning for the job but that he would be glad to
``sit down and discuss it.''
   Earlier in the day Bush, trying to counteract comments by aides
depicting Meese as a liability, told reporters in Iowa he hadn't
``authorized anything.''
   ``I know him well, favorably, but I must say I am troubled by
some of the allegations,'' Bush said of Meese. ``I think fair play
dictates that the system go forward and make the determination.''
   Meese, who denies any wrongdoing, has been the subject of
several investigations by an independent counsel for almost a year.
The attorney general has said he doesn't intend to resign, and Bush
has never urged him to do so.
   But recent comments by Bush aides, reported in the Detroit News,
have provided Democrats with campaign ammunition and turned Meese
into a political embarrassment in the eyes of some Republican
strategists.
   ``Meese is a liability,'' Peter Teeley, Bush's communications
director, told the newspaper.
   ``What a guy like Meese does is take away the opportunity to
discuss the issues that you really want to discuss,'' Teeley said.
``I mean, you are consistently asked about Meese's problems, how
you deal with it, how you stand, one thing or another, and that
just totally diverts attention from the message that you are trying
to get across.''
   And senior campaign adviser Robert Teeter said in interviews in
Washington this week: ``All things considered, you would rather not
have that problem going on right now.''

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is barnstorming across
California, hammering home his anti-drug message, beseeching voters
to shun reports that Michael Dukakis has the Democratic
presidential nomination sewn up and making a pitch for party unity.
   In a speech to a $500 per person get-out-the-vote fundraiser,
featuring celebrities and top California Democrats Jackson made an
impassioned plea for party unity but did not mention his recent
complaint about the delegate selection process.
   ``I really want to win in November but the party must win and
the nation must be saved,'' he said.
   Jackson focused his speech to the more than 1,000 dinnergoers on
the need to expand the Democratic party to include the downtrodden
and those ``abandoned by law.''
   ``California has the power to determine the next nominee of our
party,'' he said in Los Angeles where he made a series of
appearances Friday before flying to Northern California.
   He urged his supporters not to be discouraged by reports that
the large delegate lead held by Dukakis means the Massachusetts
governor will get the Democratic nomination.
   ``We can win this campaign. We come to California _ the press,
the pundits and the party, all writing off the Jackson candidacy,''
he told a rally at East Los Angeles College. ``Don't be deceived.
   ``We're coming on the last lap now. It's a long ways, but I kept
the faith.''
   In search of California votes for the biggest remaining hurdle
in the primary season, Jackson on Friday crisscrossed the
metropolitan Los Angeles area from sunny beachfront Santa Monica to
the heavily Hispanic east side of town.
   In one of the more dramatic events of a campaign known for its
flair, Jackson delivered a stern lecture against gang violence and
drugs to high school students in an area known for heavy gang
activity.
   He then got about 300 of the students voluntarily to ``come on
down'' from the bleachers and admit to drug use, and promise to do
better.
   ``I challenge you because I love you, because I care, because
I'm not scared of you,'' he said at Fremont High School in San
Pedro. Some of the 3,000 youths listening to him wore gang colors.
   ``You know and I know it's wrong to bring guns to school,'' he
said. ``You don't need them. ... No civilized, caring person leaves
home looking for somebody to hurt, maim and destroy.''
   He then got the youths to pledge they would quit using drugs.
   Jackson also appealed to Hispanic voters with a pledge to fight
the movement to make English the official language in the United
States.
   ``English-only limits our culture,'' he said. ``Our future is in
expanding our language base, expanding our culture, expanding our
economy.''
   He also called for an extension of this week's deadline for
undocumented foreigners to apply for amnesty, and stressed his
proposal for a hemispheric energy plan and economic cooperation
between the United States and Latin American nations.
   Jackson continued calling for ``fairness'' in the Democratic
presidential delegate selection system _ to make the delegate count
proportionate to the popular vote in each congressional district.
   He told reporters he was not trying to provoke a party fight or
mount a rules challenge as he had in 1984. But he clearly laid down
a gauntlet when he said party leaders should make sure that the
delegate count comes out to correspond with the popular vote, even
though the party rules to not require that.
   Jackson trails Dukakis in the popular vote by 28 percent to 37
percent, but because not all delegates are chosen by popular vote,
Dukakis leads Jackson in delegates by 1,505 to 927, according to
the Associated Press tallies.
   Addressing an issue important to people dependent on
California's large defense contracting industry, Jackson also
proposed non-military development of space as a way to recover
defense industry jobs that would be lost under his proposed
military budget freeze.
   Jackson declined to give specifics when asked by reporters to
elaborate on how many jobs could be created in space development or
how much spending he proposed.

<HEAD>Four Government Troops Shot by Rebels, Soldiers Say</HEAD>

   Sandinista soldiers said rebels shot
and wounded four government troops in what appeared to be the
second violation of a cease-fire in as many days.
   Two government soldiers said Friday that the shootings came late
Thursday after they tried to speak with the rebels.
   On Thursday, the Defense Ministry charged that Honduras-based
Contras used speedboats to attack a Nicaraguan military position
Wednesday. The rebels did not comment on this.
   Offensive military operations between the leftist Sandinista
government and the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras were
suspended on March 21.
   Leaders of the two sides reached a cease-fire agreement two days
later, and a 60-day truce went into effect April 1 during which
they are attempting to negotiate a lasting peace.
   Luis Noel Solano Jarquin, a Sandinista People's Army soldier,
told The Associated Press he was among a group of government troops
who approached 40 Contras in the town of El Colorado, 140 miles
southeast of Managua.
   The Contras told the soldiers that only top rebel and government
leaders could conduct ``conversations between the two sides,''
Solano Jarquin said from a hospital room in Juigalpa, about 65
miles east of the capital.
   ``Suddenly we heard shots and had to disband,'' he said.
   Solano Jarquin was wounded in his left arm. Another Sandinista
soldier, Trinidad Bermudez, received fractured ribs and a broken
forearm.
   They said two other Sandinista soldiers were wounded and being
treated at a hospital in Ciudad Rama, about 140 miles east of
Managua.
   A Defense Ministry official said he had no information on the
incident.
   Solano Jarquin and Bermudez said several armed confrontations
have occurred between Sandinista and rebel forces since the
cease-fire was declared.
   Adan Artola, a commander for the Indian rebel group known as
Yatama, said Friday that government troops recently attacked rebel
positions in Auya-Pinhi, 270 miles northeast of Managua.
   In a telephone interview from Miami, Artola said Yatama fighters
killed seven Sandinista soldiers and wounded 23 in the incident.
   Yatama claims to have more than 4,000 guerrillas whose objective
is autonomy for Nicaragua's Indian populations on the Caribbean
coast. It is not formally linked to the Contras.
   The government says more than 26,000 people have been killed
since November 1981, when the U.S.-backed Contras began fighting
the Sandinista government.

   A column of police vehicles moved to the
Lenin shipyard's main gate, directing powerful beams of light at
strikers manning it.
   Over a loudspeaker, police said, ``Good evening, gentlemen.''
   They revved the engines and came to a screeching halt about 35
feet from the gate. Columns of riot police on both sides of the
vehicles started beating the sides of the vehicles with their
truncheons.
   A few minutes later, police withdrew.
   Again, about three hours later, police directed a powerful
spotlight at the main gate. A phalanx of police in full riot gear
marched toward the gate banging their shields with truncheons.
   The strikers, instructed not to resist if the yard were stormed,
emptied the dining hall and rushed to the gate.
   ``There was no panic, they were very disciplined. They just
stood there silently,'' said a reporter who was on hand. ``But they
were visibly shaken.''
   Most of the strikers are young _ in their teens or early 20s.
   Later Friday, the tension apparently got to a young striker.
   The man suddenly rushed to a window of the big, second-floor
cafeteria where most of the strikers have been gathering, smashed
the glass and tried to jump out, according to Western reporters at
the scene.
   He was caught by his friends, pulled in and taken to the nearby
shipyard infirmary, bleeding from his hands and face. No one could
say what prompted the action.
   Lech Walesa immediately raced to the dining hall and climbed on
a chair.
   ``I have a personal request,'' the Solidarity leader began.
``You know that Solidarity is also taking care of the person next
to you.
   ``Everyone has a thousand problems: because he loves his wife
and he must stay here, another left 500 zlotys ($1.25) to his wife
when he left. Suddenly he realizes she has nothing to live on,''
Walesa told the crowd.
   ``Solidarity must be big here.''
   Reporters said tension eased immediately after Walesa's
impromptu speech.
   The stoppage that began Monday in the yard where the
now-outlawed Solidarity free trade union movement was born in 1980
was the only major strike remaining in a wave of labor unrest that
began nearly two weeks ago.
   Early Thursday, riot police violently crushed a 10-day
occupation strike at the huge Nowa Huta steelworks outside the
southern city of Krakow.
   At about the same time, hundreds of riot police threw a security
cordon around the Gdansk shipyard.
   On Friday, the yard was under virtual siege, with police turning
away food shipments.
   Walesa has clearly emerged as the man in charge of the strike,
although it is being coordinated by a 12-man committee. He gives
advice and pep talks, chats and jokes with strikers and tries to
organize entertainment.
   He sleeps on the floor on a styrofoam mat with the rest of the
strikers, using his tweed jacket as a pillow.
   Walesa helped found of Solidarity, the only officialy recognized
independent labor federation in the Soviet bloc before it was
outlawed after a 1981 military crackdown.
   After Friday's attempted leap and Walesa's speech, the strike
committee quickly organized a song festival. Strikers played
guitars and banjos and sang folk tunes and Solidarity songs.
   A member of the strike committee invited workers to come up and
tell jokes.
   Strikers also undertook some chores, such as cleaning the gate
area.
   The food situation was noticeably worse on Friday. After having
soup, loaves of bread, sausage and spreads for their main meal
Thursday, the strikers had only sauerkraut soup for lunch Friday.
   There were 800 to 1,000 strikers left inside the plant,
according to reporters. Most of the strikers spend their time in
the dining hall, while the rest guard the shipyard's eight gates.
   They have radios and listened closely to Western news broadcasts.

   Eastern Airlines and labor leaders traded
recriminations after the financially troubled carrier sued two of
its unions for $1.5 billion, accusing pilots and machinists of
``Eastern-bashing.''
   The Miami-based airline and its parent company, Texas Air Corp.
of Houston, charged the unions Friday with trying to drive down the
carrier's value so the unions could buy it cheaply.
   ``The smear campaign is one of a number of tactics to facilitate
a takeover,'' Texas Air attorney Parker Folse III said of the suit,
filed in U.S. District Court in Miami.
   But Henry Duffy, national chairman of the Air Line Pilots
Association, called the suit ``a desperate attempt to draw
attention away from Texas Air's and Eastern's growing problems.''
   Eastern's ALPA chairman, John Bavis, said the suit ``is like the
lions suing the Christians for animal abuse.'' He also dismissed it
as a tactic to divert attention from a federal probe of the
finances and safety of Eastern and Continental Airlines, also owned
by Texas Air.
   ``It's clear evidence of a last-ditch effort by a very desperate
man, and that man's (Texas Air Chairman) Frank Lorenzo,'' added
Machinists local President Charles Bryan in Atlanta. He accused
Eastern of attempting to shift public opinion, which he claimed was
leaning toward the employees.
   Bavis and Bryan are named in the suit, as are 11 other officers
of the machinists union and the entire 26-member governing council
of the pilots union. Some 3,500 members of Eastern's work force
belong to the pilots union; 12,000 mechanics and other ground
workers belong to the Machinists.
   The Machinists contract dispute with Eastern _ which seeks wage
cuts of up to 50 percent _ is in federal mediation. The pilots'
contract comes open for amendment July 1.
   ALPA, the Machinists and Eastern's Transport Worker Union tried
to buy Eastern before Texas Air bought it in 1986 for $676 million,
a sale they then tried to block.
   When the unions failed to block Eastern's sale to Texas Air,
they fought in court to overturn it and lost. Since then, there
have been several other suits and countersuits.
   The Eastern suit says the two unions still hope to obtain
Eastern, which lost $900 million in the past 10 years.
   ``They seek this by an all-out effort to injure Eastern's
business _ to make it a financial millstone for Texas Air _ by
means of ... mail fraud, wire fraud, extortion. ... Further, they
have set out to destroy Eastern's good will and reputation,'' the
suit says.
   The suit also claims that ``by promoting deceitful accusations
about the safety of Eastern, defendants have induced the news media
to join in an `Eastern bashing' effort,'' and have led the
Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation
Administration ``to conduct costly investigations of the airline,
all of which have further damaged Eastern's business.''
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a
non-binding resolution Thursday urging the Transportation
Department, parent of the FAA, to widen the probe of Eastern and
Texas Air to include how the public and workers might be affected
by company policies.
   Last month, the FAA announced it was seeking $823,000 in
penalties from Eastern for past safety violations. It then began a
plane-by-plane inspection of the carrier. Last year, Eastern paid a
$9.5 million fine for violations.
   Also Friday, Texas Air spokesmen partly blamed unions for
first-quarter losses of $124.3 million on revenues of $2.1 billion.
Eastern lost $64.5 million on revenues of $1.1 billion, but the
sale of $33.5 million in assets reduced that carrier's net loss to
$31 million.

   David Channell could be forgiven if he
thought someone was giving him a load of bull at 6:30 in the
morning when a caller said one of Channell's steers had fallen into
a basement.
   But when the 17-year-old peered into his neighbor's cellar
Friday, ``I just started laughing. It's something you don't see
very often.''
   There, staring up at him, was 1,100 pounds of beef.
   Channell said the steer, one of three he's raising for a 4-H
project, had smashed through a gate to take an early morning
stroll. But its wanderings ended abruptly when it fell through a
board covering the entrance to the basement of the neighbor's
trailer home.
   While the bull story was making the rounds of the rural area,
the trailer's owner, Channel's father and several others worked for
almost two hours to free the animal, David Channell said.
   The steer was spooked by the cellar steps, so they built a
wooden ramp and covered it with dirt so the animal wouldn't slip,
Channell said.
   Through it all, the steer was unfazed.
   ``He was real calm. I just walked up right to him, and put a
halter on him. He was just staring up at us,'' Channell said.

   ``I was immobilized. I couldn't move and I didn't
think to speak. I just watched.''
   So begins Joann Berte's account of the night of Dec. 10, 1979,
when she claims she was awakened on a friend's porch in Rhode
Island and carried in a paralyzed state aboard an alien spacecraft.
   Berte's story should be repeated in dozens of variations this
weekend at a national conference expected to draw more than 250 UFO
experts and people who claim to have been abducted by
extraterrestrials.
   ``It makes you very angry,'' said Berte, who said she recalled
the abduction under hypnosis years later. ``They don't ask your
permission. They just take you away.''
   Arthur Myers, a coordinator of the conference, said the Waltham
gathering is one of the first public meetings of people who claim
to have been held hostage by aliens.
   ``It reminds me a lot of alcoholism or homosexuals coming out of
the closet,'' said Myers. ``There's a stigma attached to the
abductees. But once someone comes forward with their story, others
are willing to speak.''
   Myers, a member of a Unitarian Universalist church group
interested in the study of the paranormal, decided to sponsor the
conference after attending a private UFO seminar in November in
Connecticut.
   ``At first, people thought it was too sensational a topic,''
said Myers. ``But it is something the public should hear.''
   Author Ray Fowler said about 80 percent of the UFO sightings can
be explained.
   ``But there are those instances that defy any explanation,''
said Fowler, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer scheduled
as a keynote conference speaker. ``It's imperative that we study
these things with an open mind, not gullibly accept them or reject
them out of hand.''
   From 1951 to 1955, Fowler studied UFO reports for the U.S. Air
Force Security Service. He currently heads the Mutual UFO Network,
an international group that documents UFO sightings.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega says the
Reagan administration has has misinformed the U.S. public about
reported talks on conditions for his resignation as Panama's
military chief.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Noriega
said he is willing to talk with U.S. officials about efforts to
resolve the country's political crisis but ruled out negotiating an
end to his rule.
   He also disclosed that President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala had
offered what Noriega called a ``positive'' proposal. He declined to
provide details.
   Noriega said Elliott Abrams, an assistant U.S. secretary of
state, was bent on ``misinforming the people of the United States
about conversations with Panama'' because Abrams' previous advice
to Reagan on the crisis here ``has been a failure.''
   He said policy alternatives advocated by Abrams were only
``damaging the Reagan administration.''
   Reports originating in Washington last week said an agreement
had been reached between Noriega and a U.S. envoy that would have
Noriega resign as chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces but
remain in Panama.
   The general denied any such agreements had been reached.
   He said he has held ``conversations'' with ``southern and
northern leaders'' on the crisis: ``But there are no negotiations.
We do not negotiate the dignity of a country and do not negotiate
the dignity of a man.''
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. He denies he is guilty of the charges.
   The U.S. government imposed economic sanctions in an attempt to
force Noriega into exile after the general engineered the ouster of
President Eric Arturo Delvalle Feb. 26. The previous day, Delvalle
had tried to fire Noriega.
   Noriega said Friday that Panamanians wanted a democracy ``in the
image and likeness of Panama and not of the United States.''
   ``Leave us alone. Let them not interfere with our tamoborito
(Panama's folklore dance) and we will not interfere with their
political rock 'n' roll,'' he said.
   Noriega said the Reagan administration wants ``docile
governments'' in Latin America instead of friendly ones that can be
treated as equals.
   The general agreed to the interview after he inaugurated a water
line to the community of Sajalices, 45 miles southwest of Panama
City.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Adminsitration is urging
parents of small children to return any bottles of Humco brand
syrup of Ipecac that remain in their home because they may contain
a deadly poison.
   As many as 400,000 1-ounce bottles have been mislabeled Ipecac,
a product normally used to induce vomiting in children who are
suspected of having eaten some dangerous product, the agency said
Friday.
   The mislabeled bottles may actually contain oil of eucalyptus
which could prove fatal if given to children, the agency said.
   Eucaluptus oil is used in minute amounts in vaporizers. But if
taken internally it can cause convulsions and coma, officials said.
As little as a teaspoonful could prove fatal, FDA reported.
   The FDA initially announced a recall of the Humco brand Ipecac
April 29, after the label mix-up was discovered. However, since
then it has learned that thousands of bottles of the product have
been distributed to consumers across the country as part of poison
prevention week activities.

   If you have trouble with your telephone or
other electronic equipment or notice a display of lights in the
northern sky this weekend it may not be your imagination.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported
Friday a geomagnetic storm sweeping over the Earth may interfere
with satellite, radio and telephone communications.
   It may also cause an electrical phenomenon induced by current
from the sun, resulting in a display of northern lights known as
the aurora borealis, said Joe Hirman of the Space Environment
Services Center in Boulder, Colo. They should be visible for a few
nights, he said.
   Hirman said the disturbance originated in a huge flare that
erupted from the sun on Wednesday.
   It took about a day for the effects to reach Earth, and those
peaked on Friday, he said.
   However the worst should be over by Sunday he said. But, Sunday
is Mother's Day, one of the busiest days of the year for the
nation's telephone companies and Hirman warned it may not be
possible to communicate with Europe via high frequency radio
channels for a time.

<HEAD>Leukemia Risk Not Great Enough to Ban Growth Hormone Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists from several countries say the
benefits of synthetic growth hormones received by some children
outweigh the possibly slightly higher risk of developing leukemia
those children face.
   The cancer and growth experts who met to review 15 cases of
leukemia worldwide in patients treated with synthetic growth
hormones said an increased risk had not been proven but even if it
had it is not great enough to warrant withholding treatment.
   ``There is no therapy that is risk-free,'' said a statement by
the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, which represents
doctors and scientists working in the field. ``Because GH therapy
is essential for optimal growth and development in GH deficient
children, it would be inappropriate and unwise to withhold such
treatment from needy patients.''
   The incidence of leukemia among patients taking growth hormone
worldwide is estimated at 1 in 21,000 patient-years of treatment,
the society said, while a reasonable estimate of the risk among
nonpatients in the same age range is 1 in 42,000.
   The meetings were prompted by reports of leukemia in five
Japanese children who had received the treatment.
   The society said that if there is a relationship between growth
hormone treatment and leukemia the cause could be the effect of the
hormone on bone marrow cells.

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds dropped for the
first time in eight months in April, falling 6.4 percent to $661
million.
   The Treasury Department said Friday that April sales were $45
million lower than in March, when sales were $706 million, and an
identical amount lower than sales a year ago.
   Still, with the inclusion of interest earnings, the value of
outstanding bonds rose by $1.07 billion to total $105.09 billion in
April, 10 percent higher than a year ago. Sales had increased for
seven consecutive months, from September through March.
   The Treasury Department is hoping a new program, which began

   Jurors hearing the nation's first
death-by-product-tampering case will return Monday to try to break
their stalemate in the trial of a woman charged with poisoning two
people with cyanide-laced headache capsules.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer refused to declare a mistrial
Friday in the case against Stella Nickell despite a note from the
jury foreman saying the panel appeared deadlocked during the fourth
day of deliberations.
   ``After three votes taken over the last three days we have been
unable to reach a unanimous decision. No juror has changed his-her
vote during this time. We await your instructions,'' said the note
from foreman Murray M. Andrews.
   Before the jury returned, Dwyer told attorneys in open court he
wanted to avoid a retrial in the case against Mrs. Nickell, who is
accused of poisoning her husband and another woman.
   ``I don't think we should give up on this jury yet. ... a
retrial is quite lengthy,'' Dwyer said.
   At the request of the seven-woman, five-man panel, Dwyer later
read jurors a supplemental instruction on the legal term
``reasonable doubt.''
   On Thursday, Dwyer refused to let the jury review testimony on
whether the government's star witness, Cindy Hamilton, who is Mrs.
Nickell's daughter, first went to the FBI on her own with
information against her mother or was approached by agents. But the
judge relented Friday and directed the court reporter to read that
testimony to the panel Monday.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn is charged with two counts
of causing death by tampering with a product involved in interstate
commerce and three counts of tampering.
   The death counts carry maximum sentences of life in prison,
while the maximum for tampering is 10 years on each count.
   The case is the first involving death by product tampering to go
to trial. A case concerning seven deaths from tainted Tylenol
capsules in Chicago remains unsolved.
   The federal charges stem from the deaths of Mrs. Nickell's
husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Sue Katherine Snow, 40, also of
Auburn, after they swallowed cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Excedrin
capsules in June 1986.
   During the ensuing scare, three bottles containing tainted pain
relief capsules also were found on store shelves in and near
Auburn, and Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers recalled all its
over-the-counter drug capsules.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida charged in closing
arguments that Mrs. Nickell decided to end her marriage and money
woes by killing her husband and collecting as much as $176,000 in
life-insurance benefits, then tried to cover up the crime by
placing tainted capsules in stores to give the appearance of random
tampering.
   Ms. Snow was an innocent stranger caught in the scheme, Ms.
Maida said.
   Federal public defender Thomas Hillier accused Ms. Hamilton of
lying when she said her mother talked of killing her stepfather
with a drug overdose or by hiring a hit man before the tampering.
Hillier also said there was no proof Mrs. Nickell purchased any
cyanide.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II departed today for Latin America,
describing his ninth tour of the region _ this time Uruguay,
Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay _ as a mission against hate, violence
and lies.
   The 12-day pilgrimage is expected to focus on the pontiff's
campaign against drug trafficking and poverty in countries
struggling with inflation and huge foreign debt.
   Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, was set as John Paul's first
stop after a 13{-hour flight from Rome on a special Alitalia Boeing
747.
   The Vatican on Friday released the text of a radio message by
the pope to Uruguay.
   John Paul said he was traveling as a ``messenger of the Good
News who promotes in the world a struggle, without truce, of love
against hate, unity against rivalry, generosity against
selfishness, peace against violence, truth against lies. In a word:
the victory of good over evil.''
   Vatican officials say the trip, John Paul's 37th foreign
pilgrimage in his nearly 10-year-old papacy, is a sign of the
importance the church gives to an area expected to include half the
world's Roman Catholics by the year 2000.
   In Peru, the government on Friday banned marches, meetings and
other large public gatherings in Lima before and during the
pontiff's May 14-16 visit to the nation. It takes effect Sunday.
   During the pope's only other visit to Peru, in February 1985,
leftist guerrillas caused a widespread power outage, plunging
Lima's airport into blackness as the pope's plane was landing. The
craft touched down safely.
   Uruguay, where the pope stopped briefly en route to Chile in
1987, is considered the most secular country in the region.
President Julio Sanguinetti is an agnostic, teaching of religion is
banned in public schools and divorce has been legal since 1917.
   Sanguinetti took office in 1985 after a 12-year military regime
collapsed.
   From Uruguay, John Paul goes to Bolivia, where he is to spend
five days that will include a stop in Santa Cruz, an eastern city
where cocaine traffickers are said to operate with impunity.
   After Bolivia, the pope travels to Lima to deliver the closing
address of a regional religious conference.
   In Paraguay, the pope is scheduled to meet with Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner, who came to power in an army coup in 1954 and was
recently re-elected to an eighth term. Opposition politicians
claimed the election was rigged.
   John Paul will turn 68 while in Paraguay on May 18. Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope's doctors suggested he
should consider slowing his pace during two stops at 2{-mile high
altitudes of Bolivia but John Paul replied this wasn't possible.

   President Reagan's outspoken daughter took
a few verbal swings at two former presidential aides who have done
some speaking out themselves.
   Maureen Reagan blasted former presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes, who said he created quotes and attributed them to the
president without his knowledge.
   She called Speakes' claims of fabricating presidential quotes
``one of the great creative exercises of all time.''
   ``So far, I haven't been able to find anyone to corroborate
anything in the book. Speakes made up so much of it, it's hard to
distinguish,'' said Ms. Reagan, who was here Thursday to address
about 200 people at a dinner sponsored by the Ventura County
Republican Central Committee.
   Ms. Reagan also criticized former White House chief of staff
Donald Regan, whose new book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to
Washington,'' states that the first couple consults astrologers.
   ``I never saw any astrologers in the house,'' Ms. Reagan said.
White House officials have conceded that first lady Nancy Reagan is
interested in astrology and used it to advise her husband.
   Ms. Reagan said the former chief of staff, who resigned under
pressure in February 1987, ``never understood what his position
was. There were a lot of us who said he had to leave.''
   The president also criticized Regan during a photo session in
Washington on Friday. Reagan said he didn't ``look kindly'' on
reports that Regan had criticized the first lady in the book.
   Tom Dawson, a Regan spokesman, said Regan ``has had and will
have no comments regarding his book until it is published.'' He
said the book is expected to be in stores beginning Monday.

<TEXT>
   An official of a Panamanian opposition party who
was expelled from his homeland said Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
supporters are growing ``more and more desperate'' in their efforts
to stay in power.
   Ivan Romero, secretary general of the Christian Democratic
Party, said he was forced to board a plane Friday to Miami after
being arrested, beaten with a rock and held overnight in prison.
   Romero was detained Thursday when he flew back to Panama after a
weeklong visit to the United States, said Perry Rivkind, local
director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``They apparently interpreted something he said in New York as
unflattering to Gen. Noriega,'' Rivkind said.
   Noriega is under indictment for drug trafficking in Florida, and
the United States has called for his ouster from power.
   Romero told reporters he was taken to a military barracks
immediately upon his arrival in Panama, stripped to his underwear
and interrogated. His interrogator held a sock containing a round
stone which he swung in circles and twice used to hit Romero on his
feet, he said.
   He was asked a barrage of questions, including what orders he
received from the U.S. ambassador, what his party's plans were for
the month of May, and what his activities were with the opposition
umbrella group National Civic Crusade.
   At one point, he said, he hesitated ``and they reached down and
hit me hard on the ankles,'' said Romero.
   ``I thought they were going to tear my foot off,'' said Romero.
He said he refused to answer more questions and they stopped
hitting him, telling him later such methods were normal for getting
answers.
   Romero said he was kept standing for seven hours and was
initially told he was going to Chile.
   But Friday morning his captors drove him to the airport, stopped
a Pan American flight already on the runway, and put him on it
bound for Miami.
   ``They are getting more and more desperate,'' said Romero.
``They cannot accept that the opposition is spontaneous.''
   In Panama City, the Christian Democratic Party's president,
Ricardo Arias Calderon, told reporters that the party planned to
protest to the Federal Attorney General's Office. He said no reason
was given for Romero's detention.

<HEAD>Keepers Treat Condor's Leg Development Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Condor keepers hobbled the legs of a newly
hatched California condor by wrapping them with a tiny gauze
bandage in an effort to straighten out the chick's limbs, the San
Diego Wild Animal Park said.
   The bandage was applied to Molloko on Thursday, six days after
the hatching of the first captive-bred condor, to correct a leg
development problem known as splayed legs, park spokesman Tom
Hanscom said Friday.
   Hanscom said the condition is not serious but it could become a
hindrance to the bird if allowed to become permanent.
   The same problem occurred in an Andean condor chick born at the
park and was successfully corrected by use of a gauze strip. Andean
condors are closely related to California condors.
   ``What we do is hobble the chick's legs. This simply entails
tying the leg above the feet with a strand of gauze'' that prevents
the legs from spreading out to the side, Hanscom said.
   The gauze was expected to remain in place through today.
   Molloko, the first of the endangered species to be conceived in
captivity, is otherwise in excellent health, Hanscom said.
   Keepers are using a hand puppet built to resemble an adult
condor to feed the chick. Molloko consumes some 15 diced baby mice
during each feeding.
   The splayed-leg condition occurs in chicks that are raised on a
hard surface or, as with Molloko, on a towel, Hanscom said. They
are unable to gain traction as they attempt to stand, unlike condor
chicks in the wild that move on sandy surfaces.
   Because the chick's bones are still soft and the joints have yet
to set, the condition would become permanent if not attended to, he
said.
   Keepers could correct the problem by placing the bird on sand
instead of a towel, but that approach would be dangerous.
   ``Many birds raised on sand die of sand impaction,'' Hanscom
said, in which sand ingested by the bird creates a fatal blockage
in the intestine.
   The hatching April 29 of Molloko raised the known California
condor population to 28. All of the rare condors, North America's
largest land birds, are in captivity, with 15 at the Wild Animal
Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.

   A strong earthquake shook northern Japan today,
disrupting local transportation briefly but causing no serious
damage or injuries, officials said.
   Central Meteorological Agency officials said the quake, which
struck at 10:59 a.m. (9:59 p.m. EDT Friday), measured a preliminary
6.4 on the Richter scale and was centered off the coast of
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.
   Earthquakes registering six on the Richter scale are considered
severe and capable of causing widespread damage, but the officials
said little damage occurred because of the depth of the quake's
epicenter. An earthquake registering seven on the scale is
considered a major earthquake.
   A Hokkaido Prefectural Police official said there were no
reports of serious damage or injuries, but trains on two local
lines were halted briefly while tracks were inspected.
   There have been two major earthquakes in Hokkaido in the past 35
years. In 1968, the Tokachi-Oki earthquake killed 52 people.
   The earthquake registered four on the Japanese scale of seven in
Kushiro, 560 miles northwest of Tokyo, three in Aomori, 360 miles
away, and one in Tokyo, the agency said.
   A tremor measuring four on the Japanese scale, which measures
ground motion at particular locations, can shake houses.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures the total magnitude of a
quake at its epicenter. Every increase of one digit represents a
tenfold increase in magnitude, thus a reading of 7.4 would be 10
times stronger than one of 6.4.
   The Japanese and Richter scales are not convertible.

<HEAD>Shultz Likely To Make Third Mideast Peace Trip In June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is
planning a third shuttle trip to the Middle East in June in a fresh
attempt to promote Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   A U.S. official said Friday a final decision is likely next
week. Shultz would make stops in Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria,
seeking approval for a Mideast conference that would sponsor two
stages of negotiations.
   The first would aim for three years of self-rule, but not
statehood, for Palestinian Arabs in the Israeli-occupied
territories. The second would grapple with an overall settlement of
the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   Shultz would fly to the Middle East at the windup of the Moscow
summit meeting June 2 and then attend a meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's foreign ministers in Madrid June
9-10, said the U.S. official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   Two trips by Shultz to the Middle East this year failed to
produce peace talks. But he refuses to give up. ``Who's afraid to
struggle against odds?,'' he said at the end of the last venture in
April. ``What am I saving myself for, anyway?''
   He also suggested that Arabs and Israelis, despite their public
lack of enthusiasm for negotiations, had privately urged him to
keep trying.
   Shultz told a Senate appropriations subcommittee last week that
``under the right circumstances'' King Hussein of Jordan would be
agreeable to the U.S. proposal for a peace conference.
   However, Shultz also testified that Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir had made the conference the ``centerpiece'' of his
objections to Shultz's plan.
   Shultz also was unsuccessful last month in Moscow in trying to
persuade the Soviet Union to accept a limited role in the
negotiations.
   Shamir _ and Shultz _ are opposed to giving the Soviets a chance
to shape the outline of a Mideast settlement. But Hussein is
insisting on Soviet involvement.
   On the other hand, Jordan is reluctant to negotiate with Israel
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost
during the 1967 Mideast war. Shultz has advised Hussein that was
not ``in the cards.'' But he backs the idea of Israel trading some
territory on the West Bank for peace and said the future of
Jerusalem should be decided in negotiations.
   Despite the long odds, Shultz said he did not think his plan was
``fated to failure.''
   Shultz's plan called for a peace conference in mid-April, the
opening of negotiations on the Palestinians on May 1 and a second
stage of talks on an overall settlement beginning Dec. 1.
   The first two deadlines have passed. Still, Shultz has said he
will keep trying to get negotiations started in the 8{ months that
remain to the Reagan administration to give the next president a
head start.

<HEAD>Former Police Chief Goes Free After Grand Jury Rejects Murder
Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The murder case against a former small-town
police chief ended with a grand jury refusing to indict him for the
death of his wife's first husband, who was found buried in the
former officer's yard.
   ``I feel real fine,'' Robert Chambers, 36, said by telephone
from a friend's home Friday night after the grand jury declined to
return a second-degree murder charge. The former Marlow police
chief refused to answer any other questions.
   Assistant Attorney General Gregory Swope said the case is closed
without further evidence. The prosecutor gave no explanation for
the action.
   In March, state police dug up the body of Russell Bean in
Chambers' yard in Marlow, a town of about 600 people in southwest
New Hampshire. Bean was the first husband of Chambers' wife, Sylvia.
   Police began digging after Chambers' relatives told authorities
that Chambers had accidentally killed Bean in a fight. The
relatives said Chambers' father, Clifton, told them shortly before
his death March 9 that he helped Robert bury the body using a
backhoe.
   Police arrested Chambers on April 15 and charged him with
killing Bean in 1978, shortly before Sylvia moved in with Chambers.
The two married a year later after Chambers divorced his first
wife, Deborah Wentworth.
   Melissa Chambers, Robert's sister, told state police in an
affidavit that Bean, then 25, died when he fell and hit his head
during a fight with Chambers.
   After the skeleton was recovered, pathologists determined Bean
had been beaten on the head and chest.
   According to court papers, the relatives said the elder Chambers
had told them not to say anything until after his death.
   Assistant Attorney General Gregory Swope presented the case to
the grand jury Friday afternoon. It returned its decision that
night. Swope declined to say who testified before the panel.
   Swope said new charges against Chambers ``would only be
warranted if there were some developments in the case.''
   Mark Sisti, Chambers' lawyer, would not speculate whether the
case was over, but said, ``I told Chambers to stay in touch with me
_ constantly.''
   After Bean's body was recovered, Chambers took leave and later
resigned as part-time Marlow police chief.
   Chambers also was part-time chief in Gilsum. William Hasbrouck,
chairman of the selectmen, said Friday that Chambers is on leave
from the job.
   The affidavits from Chambers' relatives also alleged that Bean
and Chambers swapped spouses, something Sylvia Chambers recently
denied. Since Bean's body was discovered, she has filed for divorce.

<HEAD>Conviction Of Youth Overturned In Death Of Basketball Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The murder conviction of a teen-ager charged in
the 1984 death of high school basketball star Ben Wilson has been
overturned by a three-judge state appellate court panel.
   In a unanimous ruling Friday, the appeals court said Circuit
Judge James M. Bailey had violated the constitutional rights of
Omar Dixon by refusing to try him separately from another
defendant, William Moore.
   The court ordered a re-trial for Dixon.
   The 17-year-old Wilson, one of the country's leading prep
basketball players, was gunned down near Chicago's Simeon High
School during the school lunch hour on Nov. 20, 1984.
   Dixon, then 16, and Moore, 17, were convicted of murder and
attempted armed robbery in October 1985. Dixon was sentenced to
concurrent terms of 30 years for murder and 10 years for attempted
armed robbery, and Moore was sentenced to 40 years for murder and
10 for attempted armed robbery.
   The defendants did not face the death penalty because of their
age. Bailey said then that he levied a lighter sentence on Dixon
because he had done well in his jailroom classes.
   ``What we have to do now is decide what to do,'' said Terry
Levin, a spokesman for the Cook County state's attorney's office.
``Prosecutors are reviewing the appeals court decision,'' he said
Friday.
   Before the trial, attorneys for Dixon had filed a motion to
separate his trial from Moore's, arguing that a joint trial would
prevent Dixon from challenging incriminating statements made by
Moore.
   By denying that motion, the appeals court said, Bailey denied
Dixon his constitutional right to challenge his accuser.

   Militant Sikh separatists killed nine
people in the continuing spree of violence that has plagued the
troubled northern state of Punjab for six years, the United News of
India reported today.
   The news agency said Sikhs opened fire at a poor farmers' hamlet
late Friday night in Kapurthala District in central Punjab, killing
seven people and wounding four.
   UNI also said two Hindu shopkeepers were killed overnight in
separate attacks in Punjab.
   The latest deaths brought to at least 916 the number of people
killed by militants in Punjab this year. The extremists have killed
both moderate Sikhs and Hindus.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. They make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million population but are a majority in
Punjab.
   Militants have mounted a campaign of violence and terror in an
attempt to create a separate state they call Khalistan in Punjab.
Khalistan in Punjabi means ``land of the pure.''
   The government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in an attempt to
curb the growing violence, has imposed direct federal rule in the
state.

   Babe Ruth wasn't just a legendary home run
hitter for the New York Yankees _ he's a registered federal
trademark, his two daughters have charged in a suit against
MacMillan Publishing.
   The suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court by Dorothy Ruth
Pirone of Durham, Conn., and Julia Ruth Stevens of Conway, N.H.,
seeks to halt sales of a 1988 calendar published by MacMillan that
carries a picture of the late slugger on its cover.
   ``MacMillan's unauthorized, unlicensed and unapproved use of
Babe Ruth's image, likeness and name tends to cause confusion and
deceive the public,'' said attorney Martin A. Levitin, representing
the Ruth family, in court papers.
   ``The 1988 MacMillan Baseball Engagement Calendar'' includes two
photos of the Babe that were used without permission of the family,
the suit charged.
   The suit, which also lists Babe Ruth League Inc. and the Curtis
Management Group Inc. as plaintiffs, said Ruth's daughters filed a
written request with MacMillan asking it to halt distribution of
the calendar. The publisher allegedly ignored the request.
   Ruth's daughters received a federal trademark last year for the
name ``Babe Ruth'' on paper articles, the suit said. Curtis handles
licensing of third parties seeking to use Ruth's name, it said.
   Sharon Dynak, a spokesman for MacMillan, said she had not yet
seen the suit and had no immediate comment on the suit, which
charges MacMillan with trademark infringement and unfair
competition.
   The plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval for a
permanent injunction blocking MacMillan from using additional
photos of Ruth; an award to the plaintiffs of all profits made from
calendar sales; additional monetary damages; and reimbursement for
all lawyers' fees.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu denounced the
United States, Britain and West Germany for voting to block U.N.
resolutions calling for sanctions against South Africa because it
refuses to end apartheid.
   The black Anglican prelate told a U.N. committee Friday that
South Africa ``is able to cock a snoot (thumb its nose) to the
world ... because the South African government knows that when it
comes to the crunch, President Reagan, (British Prime Minister
Margaret) Thatcher and (West German) Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl will
use their veto to protect the South African government from the
consequences of its actions.
   ``We don't suggest that these worthies are racists,'' he said in
obvious sarcasm, ``but it is an academic distinction.''
   The Western countries say they deplore apartheid but think
sanctions hurt the black population and do not help end the system
of racial separation.
   The United States and Britain have veto power as permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council. West Germany does not have a
veto.
   Tutu addressed a meeting of the U.N. Special Committee against
Apartheid on the 25th anniversary of the committee's founding.
   South Africa has defied all United Nations resolutions
condemning apartheid and calling for independence for Namibia, or
South-West Africa. The South African ambassador recently stalked
out of the Security Council and said it could do its ``damndest''
to impose sanctions on his country.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his non-violent
efforts to end apartheid, called the system ``as evil, as immoral
as Nazism ever was.''
   ``Is it too much to ask that in the land of our birth, we walk
tall as human beings made in the image of God? ... To say we want
to be free?''
   Joining him were the Rev. Allan Boesak, also an anti-apartheid
leader in South Africa, and almost 20 speakers, who called for
renewed dedication to the peaceful abolition of apartheid.
   ``Help us,'' the archbishop appealed, ``because we want the
emergence of a new South Africa where black and white people would
live amicably together.
   ``Is it too much to ask to exert pressure to persuade the South
African government to come to the conference table?'' he asked.
   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   He condemned the ban on 17 organizations and individuals opposed
to apartheid and also said the South African news media is severely
restricted and ``collaborates in self-censorship.''

<HEAD>Winter Storm Hits the Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A wintry storm settled into the Rocky Mountains today after
dumping 14 inches of snow on parts of Nevada and unleashing
tornadoes that descended on several Midwestern states.
   A winter storm warning was posted today in the mountains and
foothills of Montana as the storm drifted toward the Rockies, east
of the Continental Divide.
   A snow advisory went into effect in the Big Horn Mountains of
Wyoming this morning and a high wind warning covered eastern
Wyoming. A frost advisory also was posted over the west-central
valleys of Colorado this morning.
   The heavy snowfall in eastern Nevada ended Friday night, leaving
14 inches of snow at Jackpot and Austin Summit.
   In Wyoming, 5 inches of snow fell at Burgess Junction while
Yellowstone National Park received at least 3 inches of snow.
   Meanwhile, tornadoes touched down Friday afternoon and evening
in Wyoming, several areas of South Dakota, North Dakota, and
Montana. No injuries were reported.
   But there were reports of damage from thunderstorm wind gusts in
Wyoming, South Dakota and Texas. In Texas, golf-ball-sized hail
pelted an area south of Hermleigh while Crowell and Rule reported
an onslaught of three-quarter inch hail.
   Today's forecast called for rain over the northern Rockies and
the central California coast; showers and thunderstorms from the
northern Plains across the middle Mississippi and lower Missouri
valleys into Oklahoma and north-central Texas; showers from the
central Pacific coast across the Great Basin; snow over northern
and central Nevada; and gusty winds from the central Rockies across
the central Plains and the Great Lakes.
   Highs were expected in the 70s or 80s across much of the nation
east of the Rockies; in the 50s and 60s west of the Rockies from
the Pacific coast across the northern and central Rockies; in the
60s near the shores of the Great Lakes, across much of New England
and along the northern Atlantic coast; and into the 90s over much
of Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 75 degrees at the
Naval Air Station near Corpus Christi and Laredo, Texas.

<HEAD>Family, Friends, Admirers To Gather At Arlington Cemetery To

   Thousands of family, friends and admirers of
the late Robert F. Kennedy are expected to gather at his gravesite
next month for a memorial service on the 20th anniversary of his
assassination.
   The June 6 sunset Mass at Arlington National Cemetery will be
open to the public, Chuck McDermott, an aide to Rep. Joseph P.
Kennedy II, D-Mass., the late senator's eldest son, said Friday.
   ``Twenty years later, there seems to be a great emotional need
from people all over the country to express their sense of loss as
well as rededication,'' said Melody Miller, a spokeswoman for Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy and a former RFK aide.
   ``I've gotten calls over the past month from Indiana,
Philadelphia, Oregon ... not staff people, simply John Q. Public
who loved Robert Kennedy,'' Miller said. ``People are planning
their vacations around it. I have been very touched by that and so
has the family.
   ``It was one of the reasons that they wanted to have it this
year, so many people called from out of the blue to join the family
in a celebration of his life.''
   A longtime friend of the Kennedy clan will celebrate the Mass,
which will have a theme of ``rebirth and rededication.''
   Former aides and family members are helping Kennedy's widow,
Ethel, organize the event.
   Family members, including Sen. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis and RFK's children, grandchildren, sisters, nieces, nephews
and in-laws, are expected to gather at the gravesite, located near
the grave of his brother, John Kennedy. The public will gather on a
nearby hill. Everyone will be given a candle.
   Rose Kennedy, the late senator's ailing mother, is not expected
to attend.
   There will be a 40-person gospel choir and a 40-voice children's
choir at the ceremony, which starts at 7 p.m. Andy Williams, who
sang at Kennedy's funeral in 1968, also will sing at the service.
   Kennedy was gunned down June 5, 1968, in Los Angeles during his
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

<HEAD>Elderly Women Pursued By State Tax Collectors Over Penny</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't offer 80-year-old Bernita Boggs a
penny for her thoughts about state tax collectors.
   Her life has been complicated by the bureaucratic hassle over a
one-cent error the agency said she made on her 1987 Illinois income
tax return.
   ``I always thought if it was less than a dollar they just let it
go, but maybe Mr. (Gov. James) Thompson is hard-up for money,''
Mrs. Boggs said Friday.
   Ed Miller, the woman's lawyer, said he cannot believe the turn
of events.
   ``I've never seen anything like it in my 20 years in the
practice of law,'' Miller said. ``I've never had a client who got
billed for 1 cent. That is absolutely ludicrous.
   ``I wonder if she had overpaid by 1 cent if they would have sent
her a check for one penny? Probably they would have, which is even
more ludicrous,'' said Miller.
   It all started when Miller caught an error on Boggs' state tax
form shortly after the return was mailed to Springfield.
   The attorney discovered that due to a change in the tax law this
year, the Havana woman was no longer entitled to the tax exemption
formerly granted to people older than 65.
   On Feb. 5, Miller filed an amended tax return for her. He
determined she actually owed $3.82 more than had been previously
paid. The additional payment was sent along with the amended return.
   For a couple of months, Boggs thought all was fine, but it
wasn't so.
   ``Here last week I got a letter from the state and I started to
read it. Of course, I'm 80 years old and don't understand all these
things,'' she explained.
   Miller said he didn't really understand it either, but he
believed it involved a problem with a decimal point. He said that
when he did the computation for the tax return, he carried it out
to the second decimal place.
   ``You don't normally carry it out to the 10th decimal place to
find out there's an additional penny due,'' he said.
   But that's what the state of Illinois did.
   The letter from the state acknowledged receipt of Boggs' $3.82
but stated she really owed $3.83.
   ``Please pay $0.01,'' it stated.
   The errant taxpayer wrote a check for one cent to the Illinois
Department of Revenue.
   Even writing the check posed a problem because Mrs. Boggs had
never written a check for such a sum.
   ``She didn't know how to write it out. How do you write, `1
cent'?'' Miller asked.
   Postage to send the check to Springfield was 25 cents, on top of
the 45-cent stamp the Revenue Department used to send its letter to
Havana.
   ``So all totaled, the postage on both letters was 70 cents for a
tax due of one penny. Now that just doesn't make sense,'' Miller
said.
   Verenda Smith, an agency spokeswoman, said she was unaware of
the case, but suggested a computer may be to blame.
   ``We don't typically bill a person for a penny,'' she said. ``I
don't think a human would have done that.''
   ``God bless computers, eh?'' Ms. Smith added.

   University of Oklahoma head basketball
coach Billy Tubbs has filed a $3 million lawsuit in federal court
against the woman whose car struck and injured him in 1983.
   In the lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Oklahoma
City, Tubbs alleges that Angela M. Harrell failed to exercise
proper care when her car struck Tubbs while he was jogging in south
Norman on Feb. 20, 1983.
   A similar lawsuit was filed in Oklahoma County court in 1984 and
is set for trial. Harrell was dismissed from the first lawsuit, but
her insurance company remains a defendant.
   Tubbs' attorney, Larry Tawwater, said the federal lawsuit was
filed to avoid missing the expiration of the statute of limitations.
   The lawsuits allege that Tubbs suffered injuries to his head,
neck, back, arms, shoulders legs and entire body.

<HEAD>Three More Bodies Found In Refinery Blast; Rocket Fuel Maker Had
Been Cited</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with residents of evacuated town
returning home. Picks up 4th graf pvs, `In Henderson ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers found three more bodies in the rubble of a Louisiana
oil refinery blast, bringing the death toll to six with one worker
still missing. In all, nine people were confirmed dead this week in
three fiery disasters nationwide.
   Late Friday, an explosion at a fourth site, a pulp and paper
mill in Roaring Spring, Pa., spewed chemical fumes that prompted
the evacuation of the town's 2,600 residents, authorities said.
Forty people were treated for respiratory problems, but no serious
injuries were reported.
   The Pennsylvania blaze erupted about 10 p.m. in the boiler room
of Appleton Papers Inc., authorities said. It was brought under
control by midnight and residents began returning to their homes
early today, police said.
   In Henderson, Nev., site of a rocket fuel plant leveled by
explosions, residents were alarmed Friday by news that the plant
had been cited four times in the last five years for serious safety
violations.
   ``We don't have a facility big enough here to hold all the
protesters if they try and rebuild there,'' said city manager Gary
Bloomquist. ``I'd be totally amazed if that was allowed to happen.''
   The thunderous blasts Wednesday, which registered earthquake
force on seismographs, killed two workers and injured several
hundred residents.
   In Los Angeles, where a fire devastated the city's tallest
skyscraper, fire officials, legislators and politicians called for
a law requiring sprinklers in high-rise buildings. The blaze, which
began late Wednesday, killed one person and injured 40.
   In Louisiana, the three bodies found Friday night at the Shell
Oil Co. refinery in Norco were so badly burned they could not be
identified immediately, company officials said.
   Rescuers planned to search again today for the last missing
victim of the explosion and fire, which injured 42 early Thursday.
The search was hampered by several small fires, thick smoke and
huge pieces of mangled equipment.
   Workers with protective clothing and oxygen tanks found the
bodies of two men early Friday in the control room of the
gasoline-refining unit that exploded. The body of another was found
near the flaming catalytic cracker shortly after the blast.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the
Environmental Protection Agency sent investigators to assist in
determining the cause of the blast in the 25-year-old catalytic
cracking unit.
   ``You have to see the devastation to believe it. The area around
the cat cracker is really tore up,'' said Dean Perniciaro,
president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union local.
   Chemical engineers said they could find no record of an
explosion by a catalytic cracker.
   In Henderson, worried residents sought to keep another Henderson
rocket fuel plant shut, demanding assurances there is no danger of
a repeat of Wednesday's explosions.
   ``We've created a monster of fear,'' said Henderson City
Councilman Michael Harris. ``I don't think anybody other than maybe
some of those that really knew the plants knew the potential hazard
inside.''
   Harris said he received numerous calls from residents voicing
opposition to rebuilding the plant, which Pacific Engineering and
Production Co. said it would do within six months.
   State officials released information Friday showing Pacific
Engineering received four citations for serious violations that
resulted in fines since 1983, but Jim Barnes, the state Industrial
Relations director, refused to say what the violations were.
   ``Our opinion is that overall their record has been a good,
moderate record,'' Barnes said.
   Henderson officials met with executives from Kerr-McGee Corp.,
which also manufactures ammonium perchlorate and voluntarily halted
production Thursday, but Kerr-McGee said its plant has operated 35
years without an accident.
   Two Pacific Engineering executives were killed and 326 people
were treated for injuries after the four powerful blasts, which
severely damaged scores of Henderson buildings. City manager Gary
Bloomquist said initial damage estimates exceeded $100 million.
   Six people remained hospitalized, including a 5-day-old baby cut
by flying glass.
   In Los Angeles, the cause of the fire that killed a janitor,
injured 40 other people and destroyed 4{ floors of the 62-story
First Interstate Bank tower remained under investigation.
   The tower, built in 1973, lacked sprinklers, which fire
officials said would have minimized the disaster. The city's fire
code was changed in 1974 to require the safety devices.
   Fire officials said the initial damage estimate of $450 million
was thought to be too high and was being recalculated.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo today put a
moderate in charge of the nation's intelligence agency but chose a
confidant as national police chief in a Cabinet shakeup that
followed a major election setback.
   The moves came as Kim Dae-jung, whose party emerged as the main
opposition party in the April 26 National Assembly elections,
called for political neutrality by the police and the intelligence
agency.
   Roh named a former justice minister, 55-year-old Bae Myung-in,
to head the powerful Agency for National Security Planning,
replacing An Moo-hyuk, a former general.
   As home affairs minister, in charge of the nation's
140,000-member police force, the president selected Lee Chun-gu,
53, a former general with military background. He replaces Lee
Sang-hee, 56.
   The new home minister said he would make ``order and stability''
his highest priority. ``At any cost, I will eliminate violent
leftist forces and activities that hurt the social order.''
   The presidential office said the shakeup reflected Roh's will to
``execute state affairs in harmony.''
   Kim Dae-jung said today that he would work to ``open a new era
of democratic development through sincere dialogue'' if Roh carries
out his promise for democratic reforms.
   Kim made the call in his acceptance speech at a convention of
the Party for Peace and Democracy, which voted him back into the
party presidency. He had resigned the post in March after losing in
the December presidential election.
   About 1,000 supporters wildly applauded Kim's return as formal
leader of his party, and another 1,000 cheering people stood
outside the convention hall in the rain.
   As delegates repeatedly chanted his name, Kim said, ``We will
spare no efforts to cooperate in democratic reforms of the Roh
regime.''
   After Roh's Democratic Justice Party lost its parliamentary
majority in April's elections, the president said he would
``humbly'' accept the outcome and indicated he would work with
three major opposition parties to expand democracy.
   Last week, Roh replaced the head of the party with a moderate
senior politician and filled other senior party posts with
moderates.
   Meanwhile, Kim urged the government to release all political
prisoners and wipe out corruption and all restrictions on civil
rights and political freedom.
   In his speech, he demanded that the National Assembly probe
misdeeds under the government of Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan,
and into corruption allegedly involving Chun's family.
   ``We could forgive criminals but we must know clearly what
really happened in Kwangju,'' Kim said, referring to the
government's suppression of the 1980 civil uprising in Kwangju in
which at least 193 people were killed.
   Kim, 62, and his supporters split from the former main
opposition party, the Reunification Democratic Party, when both Kim
and party leader Kim Young-sam insisted on running for president
last December.
   With the opposition split, Roh won the election with 36.6
percent of the vote. He took office Feb. 25. The result brought
public criticism of the two Kims, and Kim Dae-jung resigned as his
party's head on March 17 in an effort to make it easier for the two
parties to reunite.
   The two parties remained divided, however, and the Party for
Peace and Democracy's strong showing in the April 26 election
propelled Kim Dae-jung back to political life.

<TEXT>
   A man who used a ``Make My Day''
self-defense law to defend himself in the shooting of a neighbor
has been sentenced to life in prison in the 1987 shooting death of
his estranged wife.
   David Guenther made headlines when he successfully used the
then-new self-defense law after he was charged with shooting a
neighbor and wounding two other people during a neighborhood feud
in April 1986. The state law allows residents to use deadly force
in their homes against intruders.
   However, the Colorado Supreme Court overturned that lower-court
ruling, saying the law had been misapplied, and made Guenther stand
trial. A jury acquitted him last October, finding he acted in
self-defense.
   On March 1, 1987, Guenther shot and killed his wife, Pamela, 30,
and wounded her boyfriend, Stanley Stinson, outside a Commerce City
restaurant. Guenther was free on bond at the time.
   Adams County District Judge Harlan Bockman imposed the life
sentence Friday, which offers no chance of parole for 40 years. He
also sentenced Guenther, 35, to a consecutive eight-year term for
the wounding of Stinson during the shooting.
   Guenther's lawyers have planned an appeal.
   Both prosecution and defense lawyers agreed Guenther killed his
wife and shot Stinson. But the prosecution contended Guenther acted
with deliberation, while the defense claimed Guenther fired eights
shots from his pistol in the ``heat of passion'' as he saw his wife
kissing Stinson in the parking lot.

   A Norwegian airliner on a domestic flight
crashed into a coastal mountainside in cloudy night skies and poor
visibility, killing all the 36 Norwegians aboard, police said today.
   The four-engine turbo-prop Dash-7 crashed Friday night about 9
miles southwest of its destination, the Norwegian Sea coastal town
of Broennoeysund, about 440 miles north of Oslo.
   The 50-seat Wideroe Airline plane, on a flight from Namsos,
crashed into the west wall of the 890-foot Torghatten mountain
about 8:30 p.m. (2:30 p.m. EDT), said police chief Olav Soenderland
in nearby Bodoe.
   He said the control tower at Broennoeysund airport lost contact
with the plane about five minutes earlier. The plane was scheduled
to land at 8:35 p.m. ``Rescue personnel and four doctors reaching
the crash site by helicopters reported soon after 11 p.m. that
there was no sign of survivors,'' Soenderland said on national NRK
television.
   ``They reported that there was still fire and small explosions
in the severely damaged main fuselage and in debris spred widely
around in steep and rough terrain,'' Soenderland said.
   The national NTB news agency said the crash site was about 300
feet above sea level.
   Authorities said the cause of the crash was under investigation.
   The three crew members and all the 33 passengers, 12 women and
21 men, were identified today by the police and the airline.
   Among the passengers killed was a family of five from Langevaag
in western Norway that included two boys aged 19 and 17 and a
16-year-old girl.
   The crash was among the worst in Norway since World War II.
Forty people were killed in a domestic Braathen SAFE airline crash
near Oslo on Dec. 23, 1972. Five people survived.

Second-Largest City</HEAD>

   Moslem guerrillas attacked
Afghanistan's second largest city with rockets and grenades,
killing eight Communist Party officials, it was reported today.
   Agency Afghan Press, a private Pakistani newsletter, said the
strike occurred last Saturday in the provincial capital of
Kandahar, 280 miles south of Kabul.
   It said the officials of the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan were meeting at the party office protected by an
armored vehicle outside. AAP said the vehicle was destroyed after
its Afghan crew escaped.
   The statement said five other officials ``were captured when
they were fleeing away.'' It said all five were taken to rebel-held
areas for trial.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
   Guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government are
known to control most of the mountains and desert plains
surrounding Kandahar, whose population of 200,000 reportedly has
dwindled to 20,000 since the war began nearly 10 years ago.
   The guerrillas have captured a series of important posts
recently in eastern Afghanistan as Soviet forces have turned them
over to government troops in preparation for the scheduled May 15
start of the Soviet withdrawal.
   About 115,000 Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in
December 1979 to back the government. The Soviets have agreed to
pull out under an April 14 agreement in Geneva.
   The fall of Kandahar would be a serious blow to the Marxist
government of President Najib. It would reinforce widespread fears
that the Afghan army will be no match for the heavily-armed
guerrillas once the Soviets leave.

<HEAD>West Germany Says Shipment of `Heavy Water' Not Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German company said a
chemical used in nuclear weapons had gone to Switzerland instead of
West Germany, but a prosecutor said the transaction is not illegal.
   ``There does not appear to be a violation of the law,'' said
Jochen Ruhland, a spokesman for the Duesseldorf prosecutor's
office. He said West German law does not consider the nuclear
material, heavy water, to be radioactive.
   The Norwegian government on Wednesday said 15 tons of Norwegian
heavy water were illegally diverted in 1983 to an unknown
destination by the Duesseldorf-based Rohstoff Einfuhr firm.
   The Norwegian Foreign Ministry said Rohstoff Einfuhr stated that
the heavy water was for scientific use in West Germany and that its
transport to another destination violated its licensing codes.
   A official for Rohstoff Einfuhr denied the allegations.
   ``We never left anyone in the dark that the shipment was
intended for Switzerland,'' said a company official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang reported April 21 that the heavy
water was flown on a Liberian-registered West African Airlines
plane via Basel, Switzerland, to Dubai, then probably to a nuclear
reactor in Bombay, India.
   Norway does not allow the export of heavy water to countries
that have not signed the international nuclear non-proliferation
agreement, including India.
   The ministry said it had so far determined only that the heavy
water was sent by air freight to Basel.
   Norwegian officials have asked West German officials to
investigate.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used as a coolant in some
nuclear reactors, but it can also be used to produce plutonium for
use in nuclear arms. India has several nuclear reactors that use
heavy water.

   The death toll in nine days of ethnic

   Police said a mechanical engineer was killed when he was caught

   Mohajirs came to India from Pakistan in 1947, and Pathans are

   Violence between the two groups erupted April 29 after a traffic

then, police and hospital officials say 17 people have died and
more than 50 people have been injured.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias battled with
tanks, rockets and howitzers today for control of the slums of
south Beirut. Police said at least 40 people were killed and 61
wounded.
   Explosions echoed across the capital and smoke billowed from
fires in apartment blocks in several parts of the densely-populated
district. Hospitals issued urgent appeals for blood.
   Most of south Beirut's estimated 250,000 residents spent the
night in basements and bomb shelters as gunmen fought in the narrow
alleyways.
   Police said firefighters could not enter the area to quell
blazes set by the rival groups.
   According to police count, 56 people have been killed and 111
have been wounded in two days of fighting between the pro-Syrian
Amal militia and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   As the Shiites battled, calm prevailed in two nearby Palestinian
refugee camps after heavy clashes Friday between rival guerrilla
factions in which police said 14 fighters were killed and 46
wounded.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Amal
deployed dozens of Soviet-made T-54 tanks early today in a bid to
storm Hezbollah's three main strongholds in south Beirut.
   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite zealots loyal to Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, is believed to be an umbrella for pro-Iranian
factions holding most of 18 foreign hostages, including nine
Americans, in Lebanon.
   Most of the captives are believed to be held in the southern
slums.
   Amal also shelled key intersections in an effort to block
Hezbollah's supply lines, the police spokesman said.
   The fighting broke out before dawn Friday when four Amal
militiamen were killed in a south Beirut ambush. Amal blamed
Hezbollah.
   The Lebanese Red Cross and civil defense said their teams
evacuated dozens of casualties from the battle zones.
   ``Dozens of other casualties remain in the streets in areas
subjected to shelling and automatic weapons fire. We haven't been
able to evacuate them,'' a civil defense spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   Machine-gun fire closed the main highway leading to Beirut
airport on the southwestern edge of the disputed area. But
travelers managed to reach the airport through side streets and
flight schedules were not affected, police said.
   The clashes were the heaviest between the two factions since
Amal cracked down on Hezbollah in Shiite-dominated south Lebanon
last month. Sixty-two people were killed and 150 wounded in that
four-day battle.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old war against
Iraq, but the Syrians have become increasingly alarmed at the
Iran-backed Hezbollah's drive to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the biggest single sect in the country.
   The fundamentalists seek to create an Iranian-style Islamic
republic in Lebanon, considered by neighboring Syria to be its zone
of influence.
   Police said it could not be determined if the feuding
Palestinian factions had agreed on a cease-fire.
   Friday's fighting was the latest in a series of confrontations
in the battered camps between guerrillas loyal to Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and the radical
Fatah-Uprising group.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, sent 7,500 troops into
Moslem west Beirut Feb. 22, 1987 in a bid to end three years of
militia anarchy.
   But the Syrians have not moved into the Shiite stronghold of
south Beirut, apparently to avoid a head-on collision with Iran's
allies.
   Syria also maintains 25,000 troops in eastern and norther
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate linked to the
13-year-old civil war between Lebanon's Christians and Moslems.

<TEXT>
   A large
convoy of oil tankers and merchant vessels, escorted by U.S. and
British warships, sailed through the tense Strait of Hormuz without
hearing so much as a peep from Iran.
   ``It was as though Iran did not exist,'' this guided missile
frigate's captain, Edward Mann, told a Pentagon media pool of
Friday's remarkably quiet voyage into the Gulf of Oman.
   He said that no Iranian gunboats or warships were sighted nor
was there even any routine radio or radar conyact during the
cruise, which reached the open waters off Oman near midnight (6
p.m. EDT).
   ``They either learned a lesson or are planning something new,''
one crewman said on the darkened bridge as the convoy left behind
the strait.
   The Williams and a British destroyer, HMS Gloucester, made their
way through the strait riding shotgun for a herd of tankers and
merchant vessels.
   About 10 ships traveled along with the warships in the largest
convoy through the waterway since fierce U.S.-Iranian naval clashes
April 18.
   Other convoys are waiting for escort service at the mouth of the
strait.
   President Reagan last week gave permission to the navy to aid
ships flying other than American flags if they come under attack.
   But Cmdr. Mann said that when the British convoy moved alongside
Dubai, it was little more than coincidence.
   ``It's a small ocean out here,'' he said earlier on his
sun-baked bridge as British and American helicopters crossed in the
sky ahead of the convoy. The deck temperature on the Williams was
measured at 126 degrees Friday afternoon.
   ``Diplomatically I guess it has been difficult to get all these
countries to agree to coordinate their polices,'' he said. ``But we
keep in touch out here and I certainly would not sit by and watch
if any aircraft attacked the Gloucester''.
   The 3,700-ton guided missile frigate Williams protected two
Kuwaiti-owned but American-flagged oil tankers. It was flanked by
four tankers escorted by the 4,000-ton Glouchester.
   Iraq on Thursday said it hit an Iranian naval target. This has
in the past provoked quick Iranian retaliation on ships in the Gulf
and Tehran has also vowed revenge for its losing battle with the
U.S. Navy on April 18th.
   This was the fourth U.S.-led convoy that passed unchallenged
through the strait within range of Iran's Silkworm missile
batteries since the April 18 clashes.

   Surgeons completed a rare double-lung
transplant operation on U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence of South Carolina
early today, officials at the University of Mississippi Medical
Center said.
   Spence, 60, was in critical but stable condition following the
5-hour surgery, which ended at 3 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman
Barbara Austin.
   Spence, suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease, flew to
Mississippi Friday afternoon from Columbia, S.C., after being
notified of a possible set of donor lungs in Texas.
   ``The transplant team said the surgery proceeded as
anticipated,'' Austin said. ``He'll remain in the hospital probably
four or five weeks to recuperate.''
   Members of the transplant team flew to Texas Friday afternoon
and returned late Friday night with the organs after determining
the lungs were in good enough shape to transplant, hospital
spokeswoman Janice Quinn said.
   Surgeons opened Spence's chest about an hour before the lungs
arrived at about 10:45 p.m., hospital officials said.
   Spence appeared alert and in good spirits as he was wheeled into
the hospital. The legislator's son, David Spence, said the family
was confident about the outcome of the operation.
   ``The surgeons are very optimistic about the condition of the
donor's lungs, with Floyd's physical condition and with his
tolerance to the operation,'' said Randy Mashburn, Spence's
district administrator. ``They are very upbeat.''
   At one point last October, Spence was put under intensive care
at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland in critical condition.
Afterward, the congressman went on the list of potential organ
transplant recipients.
   Double-lung transplants have been performed 30 times worldwide
and only 12 times in North America _ three times at Jackson and
nine times at Toronto General Hospital under the auspices of the
Toronto University School of Medicine.
   Eight of the Toronto patients are still living, but only one of
the three from Jackson remains alive. University Medical Center
officials attributed one of the two deaths to factors unrelated to
either the surgery or respiratory ailments that led to the
operations.
   Dr. Sesshadri Raju, professor of surgery and director of the
transplant program at Jackson, said last month that with a normal
recovery, Spence would be able to resume a normal schedule after
six months with ``surprisingly'' few physical restrictions.
   Confined at times to a wheelchair and occasionally in need of
oxygen, Spence has made few public appearances since his October
hospitalization.
   However, he has filed for re-election. The nine-term Republican
will face Democrat Jim Leventis in the November election.

   Popular former Florida Gov. Reubin
Askew has apparently decided to drop out of the race for a U.S.
Senate seat, saying that he does not like having to ask
contributors for money, according to reports published today.
   Askew, 59, had been the favorite to win both the primary and the
general election, and had collected about $1 million for his
campaign warchest so far.
   Both the Tallahassee Democrat and The Orlando Sentinel quoted
anonymous sources as saying that Askew had decided to drop out
because he did not want to raise more money for his campaign.
   A source who refused to be identified told the Democrat that
Askew telephoned party officials from a central Florida campaign
stop Friday with the news, the newspaper said.
   Democratic Party Chairman Charles Whitehead declined official
comment on Askew's announcement Friday night, the newspapers said.
   Askew has held a commanding lead over his Democratic primary
challenger, U.S. Rep. Dan Mica, in all polls published to date.
Polls also showed Askew with a lead over Republican senate
candidate U.S. Rep. Connie Mack.
   ``I would be shocked if it were true,'' said Mica. ``But I'm
ready to take the nomination.''
   Florida campaigns have become increasingly expensive in the
1980s. Sen. Bob Graham and then-Sen. Paula Hawkins spent $15
million in their 1986 Senate battle.
   With a July qualifying deadline, the favorite's departure might
encourage other candidates to jump into the field.
   A meeting of Askew's campaign staff was scheduled for later
today.
   Askew's departure would be the second jolt to the Democratic
Party in this year's senate race. The first came last December when
incumbent Lawton Chiles announced plans to retire after three terms.
   The State Democratic Executive Committee was scheduled to select
its final 47 delegates to the partly's national convention today in
Tallahassee, where reports of Askew's decision disappointed his
supporters and party regulars.

   A French diplomat who was subjected to mock
executions during three years' captivity in Lebanon was returned to
a hospital today suffering from a nervous condition, his wife said.
   Marcel Fontaine was hospitalized a day after describing in
detail the horrifying conditions he lived under while held hostage.
Two other Frenchmen were freed with Fontaine on Wednesday. One of
them said American hostages suffered the most brutal treatment at
the hands of the kidnappers.
   Elaine Fontaine said her husband began to get very nervous on
Friday night, saw a doctor and was ordered back to Val de Grace
military hospital for a ``period of decompression'' to last at
least 48 hours.
   Fontaine, 45, journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, and diplomat
Marcel Carton, 64, were freed by their pro-Iranian kidnappers on
Wednesday and returned to France on Thursday. After extensive
medical tests at the military hospital Friday night, they were
released.
   Fontaine, interviewed Friday night by the radio station Europe
1, said his worst moment came when his captors staged mock
executions, holding a pistol to his neck while firing another gun
to frighten him.
   He said he was accused by his kidnappers of working as a spy for
the CIA or the Israelis.
   ``The tribunal has convicted you. You will be executed this
evening,'' he recalled being told on one occasion.
   ``They put a hood on me and faced me to the wall,'' Fontaine
said. ``One of them put a pistol to my neck and another fired a gun
behind me.''
   Fontaine said he was blindfolded by day and chained around the
clock for much of his captivity.
   Kauffmann, his wife and two children left for a few days of rest
at an undisclosed location in the French countryside, according to
his employer, the weekly L'Evenement du Jeudi.
   Carton was with his family at the home of daughter, Simone
El-Khoury. She said her father told the family he had given up hope
when he was finally freed.
   ``He didn't believe in it anymore. He was completely depressed,
crying all the time. He was chained, locked up, without sun, always
blindfolded,'' Mrs. El-Khoury told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from her home in Collonge-Bellerive, a Geneva
suburb.
   Kauffmann, a reporter for the weekly Evenement du Jeudi,
recently shared a cell with American educator Frank Herbert Reed,
who was ``mistreated to the point of being left prostrate,''
Kauffmann's sister, Marie-Genevieve Dagin, was quoted as saying by
Agence France-Presse.
   Reed was director of the Lebanese International School when he
was kidnapped on Sept. 9, 1986.
   Mrs. Dagin was quoted by AFP as saying Kauffmann told her the
American hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group
Islamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried to
escape.''
   The dispatch did not make clear if Kauffmann specified which
hostages were mistreated for attempting to get away.
   In his own interview Friday with AFP, Kauffmann said the
remaining Western hostages in Lebanon were ``my main concern. I ask
their families to remain patient and stay confident.''
   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners still missing in Lebanon.
Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held. He was seized March 16, 1985.
   AFP quoted Kauffmann as saying the Moslems holding foreign
hostages often degraded their captives and ``took everything away
from us, even our first names.''
   He said the kidnappers gave each of the three French hostages a
new name _ Habib for Carton, Najib for Fontaine, Labib for
Kauffmann, AFP reported.
   Kauffmann identified Abu Ali as a particularly cruel guard, the
French agency said.
   AFP quoted the journalist as saying he was moved 18 times during
his years of captivity, and once was bound up like a mummy, put in
a sort of coffin under the bed of a truck and warned to stay silent
or he would be killed.
   Kauffmann was also quoted as saying he read the novel ``War and
Peace'' 21 times during his captivity.
   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac on Friday condemned those
who ``try to insinuate'' that France made a deal with Iran for the
Frenchmen's freedom.
   Chirac, who faces incumbent Socialist Francois Mitterrand in a
presidential runoff election Sunday, said, ``I say solemnly, I say
on my honor, that no negotiation, no compromise, no bargaining, no
deal took place with any foreign government, or even less with any
terrorist group.'' .
   AFP, citing unidentified sources it said were close to French
negotiators, said France and Iran agreed to resume formal
diplomatic relations under a 40-day schedule beginning the day the
hostages were freed.
   France confirmed reports that one-third of a $1 billion loan
Iran made to France in 1974 has been paid. Other reports have said
the remainder was being paid in return for freeing Kauffmann,
Carton and Fontaine.

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded two
Palestinian protesters today, an Arab report said, and Islamic
leaders tried to spur the Arab uprising by issuing leaflets calling
for ``more attacks on the enemy.''
   In Jerusalem, Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American ordered deported by
Israel for encouraging the Palestinian uprising, was on a hunger
strike in his jail cell, his wife, Nancy Nye, said.
   She said Awad, 44, began the strike after being arrested
Thursday night but revealed it to his attorney, Jonathan Kuttab,
today.
   Ms. Nye said prison officials took away Awad's mattress and
blanket today ``as punishment for refusing to eat,'' but that her
husband planned to continue the action ``until the (deportation)
order is rescinded.''
   The United States protested the order and urged Israel to
reconsider deporting Awad, an advocate of non-violent protests to
end Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel accused Awad of playing a role in inciting the five-month
rebellion. According to U.N. figures, the uprising has claimed the
lives of 184 Palestinians and two Israelis.
   Violence broke out Friday night in the West Bank town of
Tulkarem, an army spokesman and hospital officials said.
   The army said troops on patrol in the town ran into a barricade
of burning tires and then fired live ammunition at an Arab-owned
automobile that was heading away from the riot.
   An Arab reporter in Tulkarem said a 40-year-old man driving the
car and a 24-year-old passenger suffered bullet wounds from the
incident. He said the driver denied the soldiers gave any order to
stop before firing. A third Arab was injured by broken glass.
   The army said three injured people were taken to Tulkarem
Hospital after the incident and that it was checking the source of
their injuries.
   Soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters who blocked a main
road with boulders in Anabta, a town near Tulkarem, said the Arab
reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hospital officials said a 25-year-old woman was treated after
being hit by four rubber bullets. The army said it was checking the
reports.
   Also today, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse protesters who
threw stones and blocked roads with burning tires in Rafah, Arab
witnesses said. They said teen-agers also burned tires in the city
of Gaza and in Khan Yunis.
   The violence occurred hours after Moslem preachers distributed
leaflets at morning prayers urging Palestinians to step up the
uprising during the last 10 days of the holy month of Ramadan.
   The leaflet was printed Friday by ``Hamas,'' an Arabic acronym
for the Islamic Resistance Movement, one of the undeground groups
leading the uprising.
   Referring to Israel, the page-long flyer said ``the Zionist
entity and collaborators and enemies of the nation try to silence
the voice of the intefadeh (Arabic for uprising).''
   ``We will continue our intefadeh with all our strength and
determination, whatever sacrifices are necessary,'' the leaflet
added. ``More sacrifices, more attacks on the enemy, the enemy of
the nation.''
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, several merchants
opened their shops but later obeyed military orders to shut them,
witnesses said.
   A leaflet issued by a PLO underground had urged the merchants to
open today in defiance of a military order which ordered the
businesses closed through today.
   The army edict was the latest attempt to break Palestinian
obedience to underground leaders.
   By Israeli law, Awad has three days to appeal to the Supreme
Court. Kuttab, Awad's lawyer,said an appeal is likely.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering asked an official in Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office to reconsider the move, according
to a State Department official in Washington.
   Awad, who also has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio, heads the
Jerusalem-based Center for Non-Violent Studies and has also served
as a spokesman for the Palestinian cause.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Shamir, said Awad, ``beneath his
disguise of non-violence ... is one of the most dangerous people
working behind the scenes of these riots.''
   Shamir signed the deportation order, which prompted quick
protests from left-wing Israelis.
   Awad issued a statement, saying he thought he was being
victimized by Israeli extremists but believed coexistence between
Israelis and Palestinians was possible.
   ``I also believe the Palestinians can get their rights through
non-violence and a campaign of civil disobedience. This has been
the message of the uprising,'' the statement said. ``It is a much
better way the our attempting to kill one another.''
   Palestinian leaders of the uprising have adopted many of Awad's
strategies for resistance, including commercial strikes, nonpayment
of taxes, and a boycott of Israeli products.

   Two Israeli-backed militiamen were killed
today in south Lebanon when a roadside bomb exploded and knocked
out their armored personnel carrier, U.N. sources in the area said.
   They said gunners of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia responded by shelling three nearby villages, but a casualty
report was not immediately available.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two
militiamen of the South Lebanon Army were killed on a road near the
southern village of Beit Yahon, 5{ miles north of the Israeli
border.
   The village is within Israel's self-proclaimed ``security
zone,'' a 6- to 10-mile-wide strip that Israel patrols to prevent
guerrillas from launching cross-border attacks into its northern
settlements.

   North Korea has canceled a visit of two animal
experts to Japan because of a political dispute over the crash of a
South Korean jetliner in November, zoo officials said Saturday.
   Kyoto Zoo officials said they received a telegram from North
Korean officials Friday saying the government ``had been forced to
reconsider'' the visit because of sanctions imposed by Japan after
the plane disappeared.
   All 115 people aboard died after the plane blew up Nov. 29 near
Burma. The Japanese government blamed North Korean agents for
sabotaging the jet and announced it would prohibit North Korean
officials from entering Japan and sharply limit diplomatic contacts.
   North Korea has denied any connection with the crash.
   Despite the sanctions, Japan's Justice Ministry had issued visas
for the two zoological experts after it deemed they were local
rather than national government officials. They were to arrive
Tuesday to present a rare Korean wolf to the Kyoto zoo.

<TEXT>
   Israel's sweep into south Lebanon last
week broke longstanding taboos against risking confrontation with
Syria and on attacking pro-Iranian guerrillas holding U.S. hostages.
   The two-day ``Operation Law and Order'' signaled a new Israeli
willingness to get involved in Lebanon despite the national trauma
suffered by a three-year occupation of Lebanon that cost nearly 700
lives and deeply divided the Jewish state.
   As in Israel's 1982 invasion, the incursion triggered a debate
on the defense minister's failure to notify the Cabinet of his
plans to launch a large-scale military action near Syrian army
lines.
   It also risked reprisals against foreign hostages held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon although comment on this issue was
muted in Israel.
   In a two-pronged thrust, a force of about 1,500 Israeli soldiers
and allied South Lebanon Army militiamen pushed beyond the six- to
10-mile border security zone for the first time since February 1986.
   They came up empty-handed in a sweep of Sunni Moslem villages
near the western slopes of Mount Hermon, limiting their action to
distributing leaflets warning residents not to cooperate with
Palestinian guerrillas.
   A second column of Israeli tanks and infantry backed up by
helicopter gunships fought a short but fierce gunbattle with
Hezbollah guerrillas dug into the abandoned village of Maydoun, 12
miles north of Israel's border. Israeli officials said 40
guerrillas and three Israeli soldiers were killed.
   Uri Lubrani, the defense ministry's coordinator for Lebanon
policy, said the army was prodded into action by 12 Palestinian
guerrilla raids that disrupted life in northern Israel and cost the
lives of 11 Israeli soldiers since November.
   He and other Israeli officials suggested that if such raids
failed to keep the border safe, Israel might have to adopt the
``dreadful option'' of invading Lebanon as it did in 1982.
   ``Whatever we are doing along the border, and this operation was
just one facet of a whole mesh of activities, is all designed to
one purpose: to avoid the possibility that we will have to move
into Lebanon in force, with divisions and stay there,'' Lubrani
said in an interview.
   The search-and-destroy mission came within a few miles of Syrian
army lines in Lebanon, raising fears of a confrontation with the
Soviet-backed government in Damascus.
   The liberal daily Haaretz suggested Rabin changed targets in
midcourse and attacked a Hezbollah base near Syrian lines after
failing to find Palestinian guerrillas in villages near Mount
Hermon.
   ``There is reason to ask whether it was necessary to take such a
risk by increasing the penetration range to the point of proximity
to the Syrian military positions in order to prove that the
incursion was not launched in vain,'' said Haaretz.
   Defense ministry officials insisted the Hezbollah base at
Maydoun was targeted from the onset.
   ``We are facing Syrian influenced areas from which terrorist
activity against Israel is being initiated. Therefore the Syrians
must know that something is bound to happen if this continues,''
said Lubrani.
   Rabin was also attacked for failing to notify the 25-member
Israeli Cabinet of his plans to launch a major operation in south
Lebanon that risked confrontation with Syria.
   Abba Eban, chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, rejected Rabin's explanation that the operation was
routine and did not need government approval.
   ``Such an operation, on such a scale and with the possibility of
entangling results because of the closeness to the Syrians, I don't
think it may be called routine,'' he said on Israel TV.
   Among those Israel radio reported to be critical of Rabin's
failure to notify the Cabinet was former Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon, who was himself attacked for failing to keep the government
informed about his 1982 invaision.
   Rabin said actions to protect the northern border did not
require advance Cabinet approval, and his spokesman Eitan Haber
noted Rabin informed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But Shamir was
quoted by the daily Maariv newspaper as saying he was not aware it
would be ``on such a wide scale.''
   The operation also broke a previous reluctance, reportedly based
on a U.S. government request for restraint, not to attack Shiite
Moslem guerrillas in Lebanon for fear of endangering U.S. and other
foreign hostages, including two Israeli soldiers captured by
Hezbollah guerrillas in February 1986.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, armed forces chief of staff, was quoted in
an interview with the daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper as saying
Israel had been avoiding certain areas but said there had been no
American ``veto'' on such attacks.
   ``There never was a general veto. There were certain places
regarding which we didn't know if there were prisoners or not, and
therefore we had to be careful,'' Shomron said.
   Critics also said the pro-Iraninan Hezbollah, or Party of God,
would quickly rebuild destroyed bases, and might attack Israel
proper instead of limiting its actions to south Lebanon.
   ``Why Hezbollah?'' Uzi Mahanaimi asked in a front-page
commentary in the mass circulation Yediot Ahronot daily.
``Hezbollah is not the Israeli army's main enemy in south Lebanon
and hasn't tried to penetrate into northern Israel.''
   Other analysts suggested it was futile to try to wipe out
guerrilla bases because they would only reappear elsewhere. They
argued such military action only threatened to escalate violence
and drag Israel's army back into Lebanon.
   Yossi Olmert, a Middle East expert at Tel Aviv University,
predicted a ``long hot summer'' on the northern border.
   ``There is no doubt that the Hezbollah absorbed a heavy blow,
but it was not a death blow,'' said Olmert. ``This battle may give
them additional motivation. We can expect them to enlarge their
operations.''

   Far from the glare and hoopla of the
presidential campaign, 12 men will set to work Tuesday on a problem
that could spell the difference between success or failure for the
next administration.
   The group is the National Economic Commission, created by
Congress to find solutions to the huge federal budget deficits.
   Many believe the commission, headed two savvy political
insiders, Democrat Robert Strauss and Republican Drew Lewis, offers
the best hope of finally breaking the impasse that has nearly
paralyzed the budget process for most of President Reagan's tenure.
   The president's stand against tax increases and Congress'
refusal to slash social programs has given the country a flood of
red ink. The national debt will be approaching $3 trillion when
Reagan leaves office, three times what it was when he campaigned in
1980 on a pledge to balance the budget by 1984.
   But with unemployment falling to levels not seen since 1974 and
the country into a record sixth year of peacetime prosperity, the
high budget deficits have remained a distant abstraction, little
noted in the presidential debate.
   For one thing, mention of the deficits opens a candidate to
pesky questions about how he intends to solve the problem.
   While experts believe tax increases will be an inevitable part
of any solution, Walter Mondale mentioned the T-word in 1984 and
lost 49 states, a fact not lost on this year's crop of presidential
candidates.
   That is where the national commission comes in. If things go
according to script, the blue ribbon panel, which holds its first
public hearing in Washington on Tuesday, will quietly go about the
business of crafting a workable menu of budget cuts and tax
increases, far out of the limelight of the presidential campaign.
   After Nov. 8, the president-elect will add two representatives
to the commission for the final round of deal-making. The completed
package will form the basis of his grand budget plan, which he will
present to Congress soon after taking office, during the honeymoon
period when his influence is highest.
   Protected by the political cover from the prestigious
commission, Congress will swallow the bad medicine of cutting
popular programs and raising taxes and the deficit dragon will be
slain.
   The script sounds wonderful, but many observers give it only a
50-50 chance of working, partly because solutions to the deficit
problem have proven so elusive in the past.
   ``Every time we make a serious attempt at tackling the deficit
problem we run into roadblocks because there is no solution that
doesn't end up hurting somebody,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist
at Data Resources Inc. ``Either a favorite government program gets
cut or taxes get raised.''
   Another reason for the pessimism is the fact that Vice President
George Bush has taken pot shots at the commission, mainly because
one of its main supporters was Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, his
chief rival for the Republican nomination.
   In a campaign ad in New Hampshire, Bush charged that the
commission was created to provide ``political cover for a tax hike.
If it doesn't recommend a tax increase, I'll eat not only my hat,
I'll eat Bob Dole's hat.''
   The idea for the bipartisan commission to deal with the deficit
problem was advanced by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and sponsored in
Congress by Dole and Sen. Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner,
hasn't attacked the commission, but the panel's supporters still
worry that without the active participation of the next president,
the recommendations are doomed to gather dust alongside the reports
of countless other government task forces.
   The commission, whose members were appointed by Reagan and House
and Senate leaders, must report back to Congress by March 1, but
both Strauss and Lewis, mindful of the importance of getting
recommendations to a new president early, have said they expect to
beat that deadline.
   Commission advocates are betting that Strauss, a Washington
attorney and former U.S. trade representative, and Lewis, former
transportation secretary and now head of Union Pacific Corp., will
have the negotiating skills to bring success.
   Many economic forecasters are already telling clients that they
expect tax increases next year, regardless of who is elected
president.
   The WEFA Group of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said likely targets for more
revenue include increases in the top personal income tax rate,
further scaling back of deductions and a boost in energy taxes,
possibly by combining an oil import fee with higher gasoline taxes.
   WEFA president Lawrence Chimerine said he believed a national
consensus was growing that would support strong measures to shrink
the deficit.
   ``Maybe people don't completely understand the significance of
the deficit, but they are beginning to have an uneasy feeling about
the future,'' Chimerine said. ``The deficit is a long-term problem
which saps the vitality out of the economy on a long-term basis.''
   In addition to Strauss, other Democratic members of the
commission are Moynihan, who was also on the Social Security
commission; Rep. William Gray, chairman of the House Budget
Committee; Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca; AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland and Felix Rohatyn, partner with the New York
investment firm Lazard Freres.
   Along with Lewis, Republican members are Caspar Weinberger,
former defense secretary in the Reagan administration; Donald
Rumsfeld, former defense secretary in the Ford administration; Sen.
Pete Domenici, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee;
Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., a member of the House Ways and Means
Committee, and Dean Kleckner, a Rudd, Iowa, farmer and president of
the American Farm Bureau Federation.

   Members of the strike committee at the
Lenin shipyard held their first meeting with management today, an
opposition source said. A communique said the strikers were cold
and hungry but wouldn't give up the fight.
   Three members of the strike committee, church-appointed mediator
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, and an unspecified number of management
officials were there, said the source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The source spoke at St. Brygida's Church, a stronghold of the
banned Solidarity trade union federation that is near shipyard. He
said no other details were available.
   It was the first such meeting since the strike for higher pay
and legalization of Solidarity began Monday in the worst wave of
labor upheaval in Poland since the 1981 military crackdown.
   Riot police surrounded the yard Thursday, prompting fears that
they would storm the shipyard like they did the Nowa Huta steel
mill in Krakow three days ago.
   Today those fears diminished, according to a strikers'
communique issued from the shipyard.
   
   ``The shipyard is still isolated from the city, but there is no
feeling of siege,'' the communique said. ``And the ZOMOs (riot
police) are in fact invisible except for the third gate and the
railway gate where police vehicles are parked nearby.''
   Veteran dissident Adam Michnik said the government would
probably not raid the Gdansk shipyard, where the Solidarity trade
union federation was started in 1980.
   ``It seems they are going to use a different scenario than in
Nowa Huta,'' he said. ``They probably want to take the shipyard by
hunger.''
   Food has been choked off since Thursday, and the strikers were
able to share only sauerkraut soup Friday. It was not known what
they would eat today.
   The Polish government continued to crack down hard on union
activists, sentencing several to prison terms.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the national spokesman for the Solidarity
trade union federation, was sentenced to six weeks in prison in
connection with interviews he gave to Western media, according to
Warsaw opposition spokesman Ewa Milewicz.
   In Gdansk, Czeslaw Nowak, a Solidarity dockworker activist, was
sentenced to three months. On Friday, Bogdan Lis, regional head of
Solidarity in Gdansk, was given a three-month term for calling an
illegal strike.
   The sentences were the harshest imposed on Solidarity activists
for union activities since a 1986 political amnesty.
   At least seven other activists were reported detained.
   In addition, a draft of a bill, obtained by Western news
agencies in Warsaw, indicated the Polish government might toughen
anti-strike laws as a means of countering labor unrest.
   Polish authorities say the strikes are undermining plans to
reform the economy.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski told a bankers' group
that certain groups were using the nation's economic difficulties
as an excuse to fight socialism. But he acknowledged that some
elements of the economic reform hadn't been effective enough.
   The strikers' communique said three members of the strike
committee met with the bishop of Gdansk, Tadeusz Goclowski, at 8
p.m. Friday and again with a church representative this morning.
   The communique said a priest from Goclowski's curia was allowed
into the shipyard and celebrated Mass for the strikers Friday
evening. A source said one topic of the talks with Goclowski was to
arrange a big shipyard Mass on Sunday.
   The strikers' ``main problem'' was lack of food, cigarettes,
hygiene and ``bad weather,'' the communique said.
   The communique made no mention of a suicide attempt Friday by
one young striker. After the attempt, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
gave a morale-building talk and the strikers took steps to organize
themselves more effectively.
   Strike sources said Walesa told an unidentified deputy manager
that the workers, given the opportunity to run the yards
themselves, could save the shipyard's economic situation.
   The deputy manager echoed government concern that the shipyards
were on the verge of bankruptcy.
   Strikers reportedly laughed down a suggestion by the deputy
manager that they accept a small raise, the sources said. Strikers
also are demanding legalization of the local chapter of the
independent trade union Solidarity, freedom for political prisoners
and reinstatement of fired workers.
   The recent wave of labor unrest began April 25 with a successful
one-day stoppage by transit workers in the northwestern city of
Bydgoszcz. The workers won a 60 percent raise.
   Prices in Poland have risen 42 percent price so far this year as
part of the government's austerity program.
   No disturbances were reported Friday in the southern city of
Krakow, where riot police on Thursday crushed a 10-day strike at
the Nowa Huta steel mill.
   Poland's Roman Catholic bishops denounced the police action.
   Solidarity, the only independent union federation ever
officially recognized in the Soviet bloc, was chartered by the
government in the fall of 1980 during strikes across the country.
   It was suspended in December 1981.

   You'll have trouble finding your P's,
though not your Q's, if you use the latest edition of South Central
Bell's Memphis telephone directory.
   Some copies are missing a few names _ in the M's, N's, O's and
P's _ because a printing error dropped 73 pages.
   The books are accurate through page 338, then skip to page 411.
They run from page 411 to page 482, but the next page is 411 again.
The book continues from there to the end of the alphabet.
   Claire Bursi, a South Central Bell spokeswoman, said officials
think only 200 or so books were misprinted.
   ``When you print about 42 million directories every year, you're
bound to have a few mistakes,'' she said.
   The error was discovered Friday, shortly after distribution
began, and anyone who got a faulty directory can get a new one.
   South Central Bell's directory unit prints books for cities
throughout the Southeast, Ms. Bursi said.

<HEAD>INS Says Amnesty Questions Not So Difficult</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer=
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ How many states are in the Union? Who was the
first president? Must the president be a citizen?
   Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization Service say
these are the types of questions that INS examiners will ask people
granted amnesty who want to seek permanent U.S. residency.
   A person is eligible to seek permanent resident status 18 months
after applying for amnesty. The one-year amnesty program expired at
midnight Wednesday, so some legalized aliens will become eligible
for permanent residency starting in November.
   Immigration commissioner Alan Nelson was put on the spot at a
news conference Thursday when a reporter told him critics of the
INS say that the civics test questions are not as simple as Nelson
suggests.
   ``What right is provided in the 15th Amendment to the
Constitution?'' the reporter asked Nelson.
   ``I don't know about the 15th Amendment,'' responded Nelson.
``I've seen a list of questions, and I haven't seen that one on
there.''
   When the reporter asked Nelson the date of the start of the
American Revolution, Nelson answered, ``I'm not here to go through
testing.''
   The 15th Amendment passed during Reconstruction gave blacks the
right to vote. The Revolutionary War began on April 19, 1775, when
British redcoats clashed with Massachusetts militiamen at Lexington.
   On Friday, INS spokesman Verne Jervis said the questions asked
by the reporter aren't on the current list and that the questions
asked of Nelson ``mischaracterized the whole testing process. It's
misleading to an alien who may fear that he's going to have to
answer a question like this.''
   ABC correspondent Bill Greenwood, who asked Nelson the
questions, said he was reading from one of four versions of the INS
test supplied by the federal agency at the network's request.
Jervis said the questions sent to ABC were assembled for school
children nationally as part of the bicentennial observance of the
writing of the Constitution.
   INS officials, clearly upset by any impression that immigrants
are being asked questions that even U.S. citizens cannot answer,
made the following points:
   _Applicants don't have to answer the questions, but if they
don't, they must enroll in a course teaching history, civics and
English in order to get a permanent residency card.
   _The INS-certified courses _ currently available to more than
250,000 people a year who seek to become naturalized citizens _ are
given through local school districts and non-profit organizations.
   _The test itself is an oral exam, not a written one and ``we
only ask each applicant half a dozen to a dozen'' questions out of
a list of 15 or 20, ``enough to satisfy the examiner that you know
something about this country and can speak some English,'' said
Jervis. ``We're not going to ask you about the 15th Amendment.''
   _Other questions on the current list include the number of
houses in Congress, the name of a member of Congress representing
your state and the name of the highest court in the country. The
harder questions on the current test include naming two of the
first 13 states.
   Testing for those granted amnesty and who are seeking permanent
residency is required under a provision of the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act.

   Leontina Albina doesn't expect much special
attention from her children on Mother's Day. She didn't raise the
53 of them to be like that.
   ``Children grow up and they go away,'' she says. ``That's a
mother's life.''
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, she is the most
prolific woman alive. The book records 55 registered births before
1981, and she says she's had four since then. Six died at birth or
shortly afterward.
   Mrs. Albina says she raises her children to be independent.
   ``I tell them, `Don't worry about taking care of me.' I've still
got my own good hands to work with,'' she said in an interview at
her home. ``I tell them, `Try to end up better than me.'''
   ``Besides, can you imagine if they were all still here? What a
problem that would be!'' she added, her tanned and weathered face
crinkling in a big smile.
   A problem indeed. Mrs. Albina, her husband, Gerardo, and the 18
children who remain at home share a cramped, two-room wooden shack
on the edge of a slum in Colina, a rural community 20 miles north
of Santiago.
   The rickety house has electricity but no running water. The
children bathe in a small, battered enamel washbowl in the dusty
backyard, next to the outhouse.
   Why, in such poverty, would a woman have so many children?
   Mrs. Albina says she and two brothers were abandoned as infants
in neighboring Argentina to the care of a church-run orphanage.
When she was 5 years old, her brothers were adopted. She remained
behind, heartsick, and made a vow: ``I told myself, when I become a
mother I'll always keep my children and never give them away.''
   She kept the pledge.
   At 12 years of age she left the orphanage to marry Gerardo, then
a 30-year-old mule driver, she said. The children came quickly, in
threes and twos.
   ``I was a triplet myself. I think that's why I always had
triplets or twins,'' she said.
   The first 21 children were boys, earning her an award from the
Argentine government but leaving her dissatisfied. ``I cried, you
know? I really wanted a girl.''
   She would have them, during the family's emigration from
Argentina to Chile in 1953. They crossed the Andes mountains on
mule, and she gave birth during the rugged two-week journey in a
snowstorm: two girls and a boy. The boy didn't survive the trip.
   In all she would give birth to 18 girls, including twins now 15
months old.
   Will there be more?
   Mrs. Albina shrugs. ``If God sends them to me, yes. But I'd like
God to also consider me, now that I'm approaching old age.''
   She says she is 59, although Guinness puts her age at 62. Her
husband admits to 73, but Mrs. Albina said ``he's really pushing
80.''
   She said she tried birth control with an intrauterine device,
``but I got pregnant anyway and nearly died ... I think it was a
punishment from God for doing something I shouldn't.''
   Many of the children are scattered around the world: two are in
Japan, two are in the United States, one is in Switzerland, another
is in Sweden and a dozen or more live in Argentina.
   She has trouble keeping track, not only of locations but of
names: there are three Susanas, three Miriams, two Estrellas and
two Soledades.
   Those still at home keep her and her husband struggling to make
ends meet.
   According to Mrs. Albina, the family goes through 2 pounds of
sugar a day and 20 pounds of potatoes every two days. About 2{
gallons of cooking oil and 160 pounds of flour last a month.
   Although the family sometimes can't make ends meet, she says
``the smallest always eat. First the smallest, and then the bigger
ones. We've always done that.''
   The government family allowance and pension benefits bring in
about $120 a month, nowhere near enough. So they use the money to
buy woolen yarn wholesale in Santiago, then comb the countryside in
a horsecart selling it door-to-door. On a good day they can make
about $10.
   Their fame also sometimes brings a little extra. Journalists who
visit often bring along a little gift, and occasionally a big one.
In December a Japanese TV station paid for the couple and six of
their children to visit Tokyo for a week.
   But the publicity sometimes hurts, she said. ``It gives us
illusions,'' Mrs. Albina said. ``In the end, we have to come back
to reality.''

   Less than a month before the summit in Moscow,
Washington has been hit by a deluge of Kremlin advisers, who have
been issuing reports, shaking hands and posing for pictures with
American politicians, academics and journalists.
   The Soviets have been refining their techniques for wooing
Americans since the first meeting between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in November 1985 in Geneva.
   In Geneva, articulate Soviet spokesmen appeared before American
television cameras, explaining Gorbachev's policies and opening up
some previously taboo topics to debate.
   At the Iceland summit in October 1986, the Soviets put on an
even better show. Gennady Gerasimov, the smooth-talking foreign
ministry spokesman, got officials who usually operate behind the
scenes to dutifully field questions.
   For the Washington summit last December, the Soviets trotted out
even more bigwigs, including arms control expert Gen. Nikolai
Chervov, economist Abel Aganbegyan and others thought to have the
ear of Kremlin decision-makers.
   The U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, a government
board, said ``the Washington summit was as much of a worldwide
media event as it was a bilateral encounter.''
   And it said ``to combat'' the proliferation of Soviet officials
made available to the media, the American government should send
its officials and spokesmen to Moscow before the summit begins
there on May 29 ``to explain and advocate U.S. summit objectives.''
   Hundreds of American journalists are expected to travel to
Moscow for the May 29-June 2 summit, and Valentin Falin, head of
the semiofficial Novosti News Agency, said in an interview they
would have ``priority access to Soviet officials during the
summit.''
   Just to make sure the Soviet message gets across, Falin and
other top Soviet spokesmen have visited Washington and other U.S.
cities over the past few weeks.
   Falin arrived April 19 at the head of an impressive delegation
of Soviet media heavies, including Gerasimov, deputy heads of the
state broadcasting and film monopolies, the first deputy minister
of culture, deputy editors of the official TASS news agency and
government newspaper Izvestia and others of only slightly lesser
prominence.
   The parade continued on April 25 with the arrival of Yevgeny
Velikhov, who is president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and is
thought to be a close adviser to Gorbachev on Star Wars, nuclear
and other technical issues.
   During his stay, Velikhov signed an agreement with the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to exchange safety information, met
with Department of Energy officials and attended a series of
seismological tests near the Nevada test site to prove the
feasibility of monitoring low-level nuclear tests.
   Another Kremlin insider, space scientist Roald Sagdeyev, was hot
on Velikhov's heels, delivering an address before the National
Academy of Sciences on the possibility of a joint expedition to the
Martian moon, Phobos.
   Sagdeyev, head of the Soviet Institute for Space Research, then
jetted to the West coast, and was to return early this week for
conferences sponsored by the World Resources Institute and the
Federation of American Scientists.
   The social sciences have been well represented. Georgi Arbatov,
who is a Gorbachev adviser and head of Moscow's USA-Canada
Institute, led a delegation of scholars to a conference in Austin,
Texas, then came to Washington to release a joint report with a
group of Americans about reducing military competition between the
superpowers.
   On Tuesday, Alexei Glukhov of the Soviet foreign ministry
arrives with four other officials to try to work out a summit
agreement on cultural relations.
   The arts have not been overlooked. The Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden is opening an exhibit, ``Russian and Soviet
Paintings 1900-1930,'' featuring canvases by Vasily Kandinsky,
Kasimir Malevich and Marc Chagall that for decades were hidden in
the basements of museums in Moscow and Leningrad.
   The Soviets also sent 11 important works by French
post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin to the National Gallery of Art, as
well as works by Dutch and Flemish masters to the Metropolitan
Museum in New York.
   Additionally, the Corcoran Gallery is showing paintings by three
official Soviet artists, and the American History Museum next opens
an exhibit on Russian Orthodox icons next Friday.
   The New York Philharmonic goes to the Soviet Union at the end of
May, and the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra comes to the United
States in October.
   And what is billed as the first ever joint U.S.-Soviet
orchestra, with 110 Americans and Soviets aged 17-23, will open a
tour of the United States and Soviet Union with an Aug. 5
performance in Washington.

<HEAD>Republican Conservatives, Moderates Battle Over Bush's Agenda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Before George Bush could savor his decisive
triumph in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination,
conservatives and moderates launched intensive drives to set the
vice president's ideological compass in advance of the fall
campaign.
   Conservatives drew up their short list of acceptable running
mates and demanded Bush reassure them he will adhere to their
version of the Ronald Reagan agenda.
   But while the right has been most vocal in pressuring the vice
president, GOP moderates also are bombarding him with arguments as
to why he should shift to the left.
   ``The vice president accedes to the right at the risk of his own
independence and election prospects,'' said Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa,
an early supporter of Bush in the state where the vice president
suffered his most humiliating defeat of the nomination campaign.
   The advice comes from a dazzling range of Republican thinking,
from Richard M. Nixon; Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a leader of
young House conservatives, and a group of Reaganites calling
themselves the Western States Political Caucus to that vanishing
breed of GOP liberals like Leach and Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New
Jersey.
   The tug-o'-war over Bush reflects widespread uncertainty over
his true views.
   Seven years of unswervingly loyal service as Reagan's vice
president earned Bush valuable conservative support in the race for
the GOP presidential nomination. But to many conservatives he
remains suspect, the man who battled Reagan a little too hard and a
little too long for the 1980 nomination, the man who coined the
phrase ``voodoo economics,'' supported the Equal Rights Amendment
and was perceived as pro-choice on abortion.
   Those who are struggling to move Bush to the left or the right
may exaggerate the vice president's problems unifying his
Republican base.
   ``George Bush's problem uniting the party is considerably less
than it was for Ronald Reagan (in 1980),'' said Richard Wirthlin,
Reagan's pollster.
   ``His big challenge is not in uniting a Republican base,'' said
Wirthlin ``but rather in beginning to reach out to the very large
number of Republicans who will split their tickets and people who
don't have any anchor in either party.''
   Said Gingrich, ``It is clear that Bush is a man who was not
intrinsically part of the Goldwater-Reagan movement.''
   At the same time, the congressman, who supported Rep. Jack Kemp
of New York for the GOP presidential nomination, described Bush as
``broadly conservative'' and added that he demonstrated he ``could
campaign on Reagan-Kemp issues better than Kemp could.''
   Gingrich is making his peace with Bush and has his own advice to
offer, including suggestions that the vice president adopt an
agenda the congressman describes as ``humanitarian conservatism''
and portray Democrat Michael Dukakis as party of ``the looney
left.''
   He dismissed GOP moderates by saying ``the so-called mainstream
Republicans are a small trickle.''
   Nixon is quoted as advising Bush that he can't win the
presidency with conservatives alone, ``but you can't win the
election without these people.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater would turn the vice
president's fuzziness on issues into an asset.
   ``He is the umbrella candidate for the Republican Party,'' said
Atwater. ``He is the single best candidate to represent all the
varying groups inside the Republican Party.''
   Atwater contended that polls of Republicans found Bush ``has a
lion's share of support of moderates, he had a lion's share of
support of the conservatives, a lion's share of support of the
evangelicals and a lion's share of support of those who call
themselves very conservative.''
   The vice presidential nomination is the focus of many
conservatives who view it as a test of Bush's commitment to their
agenda.
   Western Republicans want Bush to select one of their own _
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, Sens. James McClure of Idaho,
Orrin Hatch of Utah or John McCain of Arizona, or Gov. George
Deukmejian of California.
   More intriguing are the lists drawn up by conservatives of
running mates who would be unacceptable to them _ people such as
Kean, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III or former Senate GOP
leader Howard H. Baker Jr. Also high on such lists would be
Republican mavericks like Sens. Lowell Weicker Jr. of Connecticut
and Bob Packwood of Oregon.
   Leach, who thinks Howard Baker would be the ideal Bush running
mate, calls such demands ``the height of mischief.''
   ``It's wrong,'' said Kean. ``The choice ought to be by the vice
president.''
   Party moderates don't expect to have the influence to outgun the
conservatives on a matter like the vice presidential choice. But
they harbor hopes of getting some of their views into the platform.
   ``I have modest hopes but not great expectations,'' said Leach.
   He cited education, the environment and arms control as areas
where he would like to see changes from the very conservative
platform adopted at the 1984 Republican convention.
   Weicker plans to hold alternative platform hearings to hear
views on domestic issues, views that will have little chance of
turning up in the official party platform.
   Kean said he disagreed with much of what was in the 1984
platform, but ``to me the platform is not very important, it never
has been. ... To me what's very, very important is not what the
platform says, but what the candidate says.''
   Consultant Roger Stone, whose clients run the ideological range
from Kemp on the right to Kean on the left, said he would expect
``a little fireworks over the platform'' but that Republicans
``aren't that very far apart on issues any more.''
   No longer, he said, does the party have a Goldwater wing and a
Rockefeller wing that waged bitter ideological battles two decades
ago. The triumph of Reagan meant that for the immediate future, at
least, all the power is in the hands of the conservative wing.

<HEAD>Bishops Urge Youths to Avoid Clinics for Sex Guidance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops have told
young people to avoid school-based clinics that offer
contraceptives, and to accept instead that ``the only 100 percent
safe way to avoid pregnancy is to reserve sexual activity for
marriage.''
   In a 1,000-word message addressed to ``the youth of our
country,'' the National Conference of Catholic Bishops asserted
this past week that clinic operators believe that ``the only way to
help you cope with your sexuality is to provide you with
contraceptives.''
   ``They assume that young people will be involved in sexual
activity and cannot achieve self-control that will lead to healthy
physical and spiritual growth. We know that there are better
solutions,'' the bishops said.
   The bishops' message, contained in brochures available for
widespread distribution, said that unlike clinics, ``schools,
parents and churches ... teach you honesty, moral responsibility,
promise-keeping, self-control, commitment and respect for other
persons to help you reserve sexual activity for marriage.''
   The bishops rejected the argument that school-based clinics
which dispense contraceptives help decrease the number of unwanted
pregnancies among teen-agers. They said ``We believe that the wide
availability of contraceptives confirms teen-agers in their harmful
sexual behavior.''

   George Bush says he no longer fumes
when he's ridiculed in the comic strip ``Doonesbury'' or on the
television comedy show ``Saturday Night Live,'' but his mother
still does.
   ``She's 87. She doesn't like it when people say things that are
untrue about her little boy,'' the vice president said.
   Speaking to a group of reporters in Idaho while on a campaign
trip through the West, Bush said he ``used to get very tense'' with
Doonesbury strips, Saturday Night Live skits and other biting humor
done at his expense.
   ``It doesn't bother me any more. You know why? The American
people doesn't believe it. So why should I be uptight?''
   Bush, who says he ``doesn't understand Doonesbury even when it's
about me,'' has no reservations about returning fire against the
comic strip or its creator, G.B. Trudeau.
   ``Doonesbury! My God, he speaks for a bunch of brie-tasting,
chardonnay-sipping elitists,'' Bush said without further
elaboration.
   Bush seemed to forget that he and the comic strip's creator have
something elite in common _ they both graduated from the Ivy
League's Yale University.

   Speaking to an auditorium full of students at the College of
Southern Idaho in Twin Falls, Bush made a verbal stumble that
brought down the house.
   The vice president was expounding on his close relationship with
President Reagan.
   ``For seven and a half years I've worked alongside him and I'm
proud to be his partner. We've had triumphs, we've made mistakes,
we've had sex ...''
   ``Setbacks,'' Bush corrected quickly. ``We've had setbacks.''
   After the laughter subsided, Bush, red-faced, told his audience:
``I feel like the javelin competitor who won the toss and elected
to receive.''

   During a recent visit to a high school in Los Angeles, Bush was
asked by a reporter for his views on evolution, and whether
``creationism,'' a religious theory on the origins of mankind,
should be taught along with it. A big question but Bush, who says
he wants to be known as ``the education president,'' had a short
answer.
   ``I haven't given it any thought at all,'' he said.

   Horoscopes aren't as popular as comic strips and
obituaries and surveys find few people willing to admit they are
guided by the stars, but astrology is firmly rooted in American
culture.
   ``Part of it is amusing and a parlor game, but unfortunately
some people take it seriously,'' says Paul Kurtz, chairman of the
Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the
Paranormal.
   ``If it is the case that the U.S. delayed the INF signing due to
astrological predictions, that is serious,'' Kurtz said.
   What he was talking about, of course, was the disclosure by
former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan that Nancy Reagan
consulted astrologers about her husband's schedule, including the
signing of a nuclear arms limitation treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Her spokeswoman later confirmed that Mrs. Reagan did, indeed,
consult astrologers. But the president said he had never based a
policy decision on a horoscope.
   If true, that's just a darn shame, according to Joelle Mahoney,
president of the 140-member Astrologers Guild of America.
   ``Using an astrologer, to me, is just one more piece of input
for the president to make a decision,'' she said Friday.
   To determined skeptics such as Kurtz, astrology is just another
instance of what H.L. Mencken once called ``the virulence of the
national appetite for bogus revelation.''
   A survey of 2,000 adults, conducted last year by the Public
Opinion Laboratory of Northern Illinois University, found that
two-thirds were regular or occasional readers of horoscopes and 36
percent thought astrology was scientific. However, only 7 percent
said they ever adjusted their plans based on their horoscopes.
   New York Telephone gets a million calls a month _ at 28 cents a
call _ for its dial-a-horoscope lines. However, according to
company spokesman Steve Marcus, three to four times more callers
dial for weather forecasts.
   The Gallup Poll hasn't asked adults about astrology since 1978,
when it found that 29 percent of the respondents said they believed
in it. More people expressed belief in such things as extra-sensory
perception and deja vu, said Colleen McMurray of the Gallup
Organization, but astrology ranked higher than the Loch Ness
monster and Bigfoot, with only 13 percent believing in them.
   Barry Karr, who works with Kurtz's committee, said Gallup polls
of children aged 13-17 found that belief in astrology increased
from 40 percent in 1978 to 52 percent in 1986. In contrast, the
number of those who believed in ESP fell from 67 percent to 46
percent and belief in the Loch Ness monster dropped from 31 percent
to 13 percent.
   In newspaper readership surveys, anywhere from one-fifth to
one-half of those surveyed say they read the daily horoscope, said
Deanne Termini, executive vice president of Belden Associates of
Dallas, a newspaper marketing research firm. It averages out to
about one out of three readers, she said,
   By comparison, obituaries, editorials, comic strips and the
``Dear Abby'' or ``Ann Landers'' columns are followed by about 50
percent of newspaper readers, she said, while 20 percent do the
crossword and only 5 percent bother with the bridge column.
   As far as Mrs. Mahoney of the astrology guild is concerned,
newspaper horoscopes ``are about the worst press that astrology
has.''
   ``The true science of astrology is quite complex, and there are
no two astrological profiles that are the same,'' she said.
   Robert W. Cooper, executive-secretary of the American Federation
of Astrologers in Tempe, Ariz., takes a kindlier view of newspaper
horoscopes, saying they at least serve to interest people in the
art.
   The federation has between 4,000 and 5,000 members, Cooper said,
adding that not all are astrologers. He estimated that the number
of Americans involved in ``serious astrology'' is no more than
50,000 _ astrologers and clients included.
   All in all, Cooper said, the publicity generated by the White
House connection made it a good week for astrologers. And he didn't
seem at all surprised that it came on the same week the federation
was observing the 50th anniversary of its founding _ on May 4,
1938, in Washington, D.C.
   Cooper and Mrs. Mahoney say astrology can't predict anything.
Even with the help of computers, which have cut the time for
casting a horoscope from six hours to 20 seconds, Mrs. Mahoney
said: ``We don't promise anything. We simply view ourselves as
map-readers.''
   ``We can advise you, for instance, that the aspects in effect
make you accident-prone for the coming period,'' said Cooper.
However, he said, astrology can't predict whether an accident will
happen.
   The risk of making predictions was demonstrated last week by
Ostaro, the Hindu Astrologer, who volunteered to peer into
President Reagan's future for The Associated Press.
   In addition to predicting Tuesday that Reagan might have some
foot and knee injuries next year, Ostaro volunteered a prediction
that the Chicago White Sox would beat the New York Yankees that
night. The Yankees won.
   Despite skepticism, astrology has even had its moments in court.
   In 1985, the California Supreme Court overturned an Azusa city
ordinance which banned fortune-telling, astrology, palmistry,
tea-leaf reading and other occult arts.
   The only dissenting justice, Malcolm Lucas, argued that a
municipality has the right ``to protect its citizens from their own
gullibility.''
   But Justice Stanley Mosk wrote for the majority: ``When such
persons communicate their beliefs to others, they are not acting
fraudulently; they are communicating opinions which, however
dubious, are unquestionably protected by the Constitution.''
   Mosk noted that many other people ``purport to predict the
future,'' including economists, investment counselors, political
pollsters, and ``clergymen who describe the concept of a
hereafter.''

   Alligators once were threatened with
extinction in Florida, but now they're all over the place and will
be subject to legal hunting this fall for the first time in 26
years, a state agency has decided.
   The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission agreed Friday
to hunting in 28 selected areas after the Florida Audubon Society
challenged rules that would have permitted a county-by-county or
statewide hunt.
   Audubon officials said the larger hunt would have killed too
many alligators and wasn't what the Legislature intended when it
passed a law that lifted 'gator-hunting restrictions.
   ``We did what they asked,'' said Scott Ball, a spokesman for the
commission. The designations were approved without debate.
   ``The next step is to go to those areas and decide how many
alligators can be taken from each,'' Ball said.
   The commission is scheduled to make that decision in July after
staffers conduct an alligator census in the swamps and lakes.
   The commission plans to permit 15 percent of the adult 'gators
in each area to be harvested.
   Alligator hunting and trapping was banned in the early 1960s
when the reptiles were threatened with extinction and they were
given national endangered species status in 1973. They have since
made a comeback and have been removed from endangered and
threatened species lists.
   Biologists say there is no way to make a firm estimate of the
statewide population, but rough guesses have ranged from 1 million
to 6 million. Biologists say they have evidence the gators are
outgrowing their habitat and some may starve if the population
isn't reduced.

   Businessman Guy Smith met Jesse Jackson across a
negotiating table in 1981 when Smith was a vice president for 7Up
Corp. and Jackson was pressuring corporations to expand
opportunities for blacks.
   They met several times with subordinates and alone, coming up
with a ``covenant'' under which 7Up agreed to spend $61 million to
improve its minority hiring and spending program.
   Today, Smith says, `I am a Republican, but if Jesse is the
(Democratic) nominee, I will vote for him.''
   ``He never one time wanted us to give something to somebody. He
wanted us to give opportunity,'' for blacks, which ultimately was
great for the 7Up business, recalled Smith, now a Phillip Morris
vice president.
   It was a different side of Jesse Jackson that Smith and other
corporate executives saw _ different from the man the public had
come to know as a fiery spokesman for black concerns, who led
street demonstrations, railed against City Hall, blasted the
administration in Washington and spouted militant rhetoric.
   The public Jackson, as head of his civil rights organization
Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity), was honing his
skills as a champion headline grabber, always able to seize on an
issue or tactic that would put PUSH in the news.
   During those years, he began to develop a less flamboyant side,
with the tactics of conciliatory persuasion that he is showcasing
in his campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination.
   For instance, he was given credit for successful mediation of
the devastating 1980 Chicago firefighters' strike _ 22 people died
in fires during the strike _ after marathon sessions with blacks,
who were insisting on affirmative action before they would unite
with white unionists, and with white firefighters and city
officials.
   That side of Jackson has become more dominant in the years since
his 1984 presidential bid.
   Gone are the dashikis, blue jeans and leather vests that were
the uniform of Jackson's youthful protest days.
   Also gone is much of the confrontational rhetoric typified by
his remarks on the day he launched PUSH in 1971: ``Power must not
be blind. It must be used ... to picket, vote and if necessary to
engage in civil disobedience ... We will be as nonviolent as we can
be, and as violent as we must be.''
   In Chicago, it is difficult to find many associates who don't
offer the observation that Jackson has grown and matured since
those days.
   Today, in impeccable business suits and silk ties, Jackson
projects himself as a conciliator and mediator, holding himself
above the fray of campaign attacks and holding out the promise of
understanding to all constituencies.
   Even in the heat of the New York primary, when Mayor Ed Koch
called Jackson a liar, Jackson brushed it off.
   One former critic, Chicago radio commentator Lu Palmer, says he
set aside his misgivings about Jackson after determining his ego
wasn't as big as it used to be.
   ``I was one of Jesse's greatest critics in the 70s. I was not
convinced he was as serious about the movement as he was about
himself,'' Palmer said. ``I had quit attending PUSH because I was
convinced Jesse was not for real. Now I'm one of his biggest
supporters.''
   But some say it's the old Jackson in a new package.
   ``Jesse is for Jesse. Everything else is No. 2,'' said Marshall
Field, former owner of the Sun-Times newspaper. He declined further
comment.
   Many who have been critical in the past seem reluctant to say
anything negative about Jackson today as he glows in the successes
of his presidential campaign.
   Former Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne contends Jackson was always
capable of both protesting and trying to bring people together. ``I
don't see him any different today,'' she said.
   But Jackson backers point out that times have changed since the
South Carolina native arrived in Chicago as a semininary student in
the early 1960s _ and Jackson has changed with them.
   ``Those were the days when he was absolutely confrontational,''
said Bishop H.H. Brookins of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church, a longtime ally. ``That was the only way he got coverage
was to be confrontational ... He's much more thoughtful now than he
once was. I attribute that to maturing at the public level.''
   In the PUSH days, when Jackson was fighting to improve the
economic and political clout of blacks, he achieved many of his
goals through boycotts or the threat of boycotts, public attacks on
adversaries during revival-style PUSH meetings and an ability to
mobilize black followers.
   Recognized today as a master at using the news media, Jackson
made every effort to cultivate reporters, especially those from the
black press, said Nate Clay, a former PUSH spokesman and now editor
of the weekly Chicago Metro News.
   A workaholic who has skimmed several newspapers by 6 a.m.,
Jackson knew how to make headlines, Clay said. He gave his staff
tips on how to give reporters short, snappy quotations.
   ``He did not hesitate to call up editors and make his views
known on editorials and stories,'' and before long Jackson was the
one who was called by reporters for comment on the various civil
rights stories of the day.
   ``If I was critical of him, he'd almost always call and try to
talk it out,'' said Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko. ``Even if
I was 100 percent right, I'd spend the next three days walking
around with my liberal guilt throbbing.''
   Royko said Jackson tried to persuade rather than intimidate him.
But a former Chicago Sun-Times official said that Jackson would
make threatening calls ``unless the Sun-Times did exactly what he
wanted.''
   ``He would say it was anti-black,'' and threaten to make a
public uproar over the matter, said the newspaper official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

   On one occasion, Jackson saw a new black reporter on TV, Clay
recalled.
   ``He started asking around the room, `Who is that?' A week or so
later, this reporter was at Jesse's house. Jesse told him he had an
exclusive for him.''
   That was typical of the way Jackson would ``cultivate anybody
who could do him a favor,'' Clay said. ``Jesse has a knack of going
around picking up people like some people pick up stray dogs.''
   ``He certainly was very fiery,'' in those days, said Chicago
political consultant Don Rose, who now says his previously reported
description of Jackson conniving to grab the mantle of the slain
Dr. Martin Luther King has been overblown.
   Rose said in a recent interview that the day after King's 1968
assassination in Memphis, Jackson asked Rose to set up a couple of
TV interviews for him in Chicago.
   In general conversation, according to Rose, the two subsequently
fell to discussing how Jackson ``had terrific potential to become
the leader of the movement.''
   But Rose said there was no concerted plan, as he had been quoted
saying, to engineer that eventuality.
   In any event, Jackson for two days wore a turtleneck _ even in a
King memorial service of the Chicago City Council _ stained with
what he said was King's blood.
   He told the council: ``I come here with a heavy heart because on
my chest is the stain of blood from Dr. King's head.''
   Jackson's biographer, Barbara Reynolds, said that more than 100
articles in the year after King's assassination reported that
King's blood was on Jackson's shirt and that Jackson had cradled
the dying leader or that he was the last person King had spoken to.
All these details are disputed by some King associates who were
present on the balcony of the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tenn.,
where King was shot.
   Jackson has been vague in more resent interviews on the events
in Memphis. He said in an interview on television's Phil Donahue
show in April that it was not true he had not touched the dying
King. He said he ran up to the balcony after a sheet had been put
over the body. ``I then got up from a very bloody scene,'' he said.
``Blood was everywhere.''
   Mistrust of Jackson lingers from those days. King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, and some other civil rights colleagues refuse
to endorse Jackson.
   In his campaign, Jackson frequently cites his ties to King, but
the Rev. Hosea Williams, an Atlanta city councilman, said Jackson
``could never work as a team person,'' with King or other members
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Williams recalled a staff meeting where Jackson stubbornly
challenged King's ideas.
   ``It got so ridiculous that Dr. King got up and walked out. As
he got to the door, he turned around and he said, `Jesse, if you
want to start your own national orgnization you can do so, but you
don't have to destroy me ...''
   Ultimately, Jackson split with SCLC leaders over finances and
the leadership of the Operation Breadbasket arm of SCLC which he
headed.
   Jackson's longtime friend and pastor, the Rev. Clay Evans,
contended some were jealous of Jackson because of his stature and
support.
   In Chicago, ``he was the movement,'' Evans said. ``Without him
there wouldn't have been any movement.''
   Jackson's fame grew as he took on everything from housing
discrimination and youth problems and signed minority opportunity
pacts with such companies as Anheuser Busch, Burger King, Heublein
and Coca Cola.
   One day he would be launching boycott against Coca Cola, telling
blacks ``Don't choke on Coke.'' The next day he might be pledging
to defeat a proposed police chief or school board member.
   ``Nobody wants to be on PUSH's so-called list,'' said Heublein
spokesman Erik Pierce. ``He wasn't just a ragtag individual. He was
head of a significant organization.''
   PUSH had 32 chapters nationwide and Jackson's weekly sermons
were carried on live radio every Saturday.
   ``I think anybody that was in business knew about Jesse
Jackson,'' said Frank Sellinger, former head of Schlitz Brewery.
   The Schlitz-PUSH pact was signed before Sellinger arrived in the
late 1970s. But he said he heard from Jackson later when Jackson
fought the brewery's efforts to force out an unprofitable black
distributor.
   ``If PUSH decided to get on your case about something, you got a
real fight on your hands,'' said Evans. ``PUSH became the eyes, the
ears and the feet of the black community.''
   Those who dealt with Jackson say he was as canny and in control
behind closed corporate doors as he was firing up his followers.
   ``It wasn't a lot of yelling ... but it was, `You're going to do
this,''' said Pierce of Heublein.
   ``He was very businesslike. I found him to be tough but fair,''
said former Schlitz spokesman Ben Barkin. He said Jackson `'made it
clear his demands were either, or else.''
   Former Heublein spokesman John Cox said he never dreaded going
to the PUSH negotiations. Jackson was ``electric and charismatic,''
and a sharp negotiator.

<HEAD>United Methodist Conference Moves Church Toward Middle Ground</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Liberal and conservative wings of the United
Methodist church, often in conflict over issues such as
homosexuality, seemed to find a middle ground and reached a
surprising reconciliation at their just-concluded governing
conference.
   ``We've seen here a real coming together,'' said the Rev. Dennis
M. Campbell of Duke University Divinity School in North Carolina.
``There has been a great spirit of inclusiveness and openness.''
   Bishop Earl G. Hunt of Lakeland, Fla., outgoing president of the
Council of Bishops, said, ``We moved back to our moorings.''
   The 9.6-million-member United Methodist church, the second
largest in American Protestantism next to the Southern Baptist
Convention, wound up its 11-day conference Friday night.
   The conference's centerpiece achievement was a new doctrinal
summary, adopted overwhelmingly by the nearly 1,000 delegates after
keen differences between liberals and conservatives were amicably
resolved in committee.
   That 10,000-word document covers basic beliefs, emphasizing the
primacy of Scripture but also affirming the value of theological
exploration.
   As the church's compass for the years ahead, it drew accolades
from all sides, conservative, liberal and in-between.
   Terming it ``a miracle,'' the Rev. Donald Messer, a Denver
theologian who had objected to an earlier draft as suppressive,
applauded the modified and approved version as a win for everyone.
   It also was hailed by conservatives. The Rev. James Heidinger of
Wilmore, Ky., head of an evangelical caucus called Good News, said
it provided ``a good distinction between doctrinal norms and
theological process.''
   Both wings also indicated that same sort of satisfaction with
other major decisions by the conference, including its adoption of
a new hymnal and stands on homosexuality.
   While the church traditionally has been socially activist,
conservatives had charged that it had swung too far in that
direction.
   ``Righteousness prevailed,'' said the Rev. Edmond Robb, an
evangelist from Marshall, Texas. ``Liberals listened to the grass
roots. There has been a mellowing on both sides.''
   From the other camp, the Rev. James A. Wall of Chicago,
influential Methodist editor of the ecumenical weekly Christian
Century, said: ``What impressed me was the more conciliatory mood.
As a liberal, I was not bothered to see a clear shift to
accommodate conservatives in the church.''
   He said national church leadership previously had gotten ``out
of step with the constituency'' and called the new position ``more
centrist.''
   The high level of consensus was indicated by overwhelming
concurrence in the key votes, usually more than 80 or 90 percent of
the delegates. Only on subsidiary matters did any wide divisions
show up, and these were rare.
   The lengthiest debate, nearly four hours, came on the issue of
homosexuality. The debate ended with the church reaffirming its ban
on active homosexuals in the ministry and condemning such activity
generally.
   But the vote on that also showed strong support _ 80 percent _
in affirming this stand: ``Although we do not condone the practice
of homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible with
Christian teaching, we affirm that God's grace is available to
all.''
   That phrase was added to point up inclusion of everyone,
whatever their sins, within the church's caring. So were several
confessions of the church's insufficient understandings of sexual
complexities.
   The church ordered a comprehensive scientific-theological
inquiry into homosexuality as well biblical-ethical analysis.
   ``Homosexuality has proved to be particularly troubling to
conscientious Christians of differing opinions,'' the church said,
with ``important questions'' remaining in dispute.
   ``It's a tacit recognition that there is some legitimacy to
various points of view,'' said the Rev. George McClain of New
York's Staten Island, executive of the Methodist Federation for
Social Action.
   A big conference step was adoption of an updated 960-page book
of ritual, psalms and hymns, sticking to masculine imagery in the
lyrics about God, but using sexually inclusive language about
people.
   There also are three new hymns allegorically portraying the
feminine aspects of God, and added Hispanic, black, Korean and
other ethnic songs and spirituals.
   Delegates stiffened their stand on abortion, condemning it as
means of birth control or for selecting a baby's sex.
   Summing up the conference, the Rev. Spurgeon Dunnam of Dallas
said:
   ``Traditional categories of right and left just don't fit this
conference. The pronounced effort has been to come together to
build consensus. I've sensed a lot of moving toward each other.''

<HEAD>Judge Naturalizes Family, Stops Immigration Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>

   A federal judge was moved by a Swiss family's
problems with immigration officials, so he had his clerk draw up
the paperwork and made them citizens on the spot.
   ``You come off the bench thinking this is what they hired you to
do,'' said U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin. ``It's called justice.''
   Pietro and Birgitte Semadeni and their sons, Reto and Fortunat,
have been in the United States since 1975 and in the Cincinnati
area for six years.
   They thought the Immigration and Naturalization Service had
granted their request for permanent residence in 1981, so they
applied for citizenship.
   Nothing happened.
   They hired an attorney, Hope Levitt Frye, who asked Rubin on
Friday to order the INS to act on the citizenship request. She said
INS agents in New York repeatedly lost the family's request for
residency and that unusual paperwork delays occurred after their
residency hearing took place.
   Ms. Frye said that despite the delays, INS officers assured
Semadeni that his permanent residency had been approved and told
him he could switch jobs.
   Semadeni came to the United States with a Swiss company and left
to join Borden Chemical Co. in Cincinnati. He now runs his own
import-export chemical company.
   INS attorney Russell A. Elzot admitted the agency made mistakes,
but argued that the Semadenis were in this country illegally
because the head of the family switched jobs before winning
permanent residence.
   Rubin ordered the INS to include the Semadenis in a June
naturalization ceremony, but Ms. Frye jumped up and urged Rubin,
``Do it today.''
   She explained that the INS could initiate deportation
proceedings before the naturalization ceremony and that the
Semadenis could be ineligible for naturalization if immediate
action were not taken.
   ``This thing got to me emotionally,'' the judge said later. ``I
had to adjourn court for a while.''
   He returned to the bench and ordered the clerk's office to
prepare citizenship certificates. ``They were up here in 10
minutes,'' Rubin said.
   Courtroom deputy Stephen Snyder administered the oath.
   ``I don't think I have ever seen a judge understand what was at
stake so quickly and fix it,'' Ms. Frye said.
   Elzot said the INS reserved the right to appeal Rubin's ruling,
but said the decision was out of his hands.

<TEXT>
   Voters got 24 hours of calm Saturday to decide who
will be their next president after a tumultuous week during which
hostages were freed in Lebanon and New Caledonia and the candidates
ended their campaigns.
   President Francois Mitterrand, 71, a Socialist seeking a second
seven-year term, remained the favorite in Sunday's runoff against
55-year-old conservative Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Still, Chirac was expected to benefit from the release Wednesday
of the last three French hostages in Lebanon and the assault
Thursday on Melanesian separatists in New Caledonia that freed 22
policemen and a prosecutor.
   Under French law, no polls can be published the week before an
election, so it was impossible to determine how much Chirac may
have gained.
   The official campaign ended Friday night with the last political
rallies, the final radio and television appeals to France's 38.3
million registered voters. The law prohibits campaigning on the day
before an election.
   In the first round of the election April 24, Mitterrand won 34.1
percent of the vote in the field of nine candidates. Chirac was
second with 19.9 percent. The last polls, published a week ago,
predicted Mitterrand would win from 53 to 57 percent of the vote.
   Speaking before an estimated 50,000 people at a final rally
Friday night in the southwestern city of Toulouse, the president
said he was waging his ``ultimate political battle,'' noting that
he needed more than just Socialist votes to win a new term.
   ``We are not sufficiently numerous ourselves,'' he said. ``We
need Frenchmen beyond our ranks, to surpass our own borders.''
   Mitterrand flew to the Netherlands on Saturday to address the
closing session of the European International Movement, a private
organization formed in 1948 to promote the idea of Europe-wide
cooperation.
   Chirac, in an interview Saturday in the right-wing newspaper Le
Figaro, asked voters to think carefully.
   ``Who, between Mr. Mitterrand and myself, allowed unemployment
and insecurity to grow?'' he asked. ``Who has started to reduce
them? Who encouraged clandestine immigration? Who, to the contrary,
put an end to laxism?''
   He said that when the French compare the results of five years
of Socialist government, from 1981 to 1986, and two years of
center-right government following the conservative victory in the
1986 legislative elections, they will see who has succeeded.
   Chirac said the incidents in Lebanon and New Caledonia were not
timed to coincide with the election. He also said the return to
France of a secret agent who was convicted in New Zealand of
sinking a Greenpeace ship was not related to the campaign.
   ``The conditions of the release of the hostages in Lebanon
conformed with honor and dignity, without a shadow of a deal with
terrorist groups, without the shadow of reciprocity,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the events became an element in the last hours of
the campaign.
   ``France has recovered one by one its children, held far from
here,'' said Culture Minister Francois Leotard. ``It would not be
appropriate if the real author of this French success, Jacques
Chirac, is unrewarded on Sunday.''
   Despite the fact that the releases were the work of the Chirac
government, Mitterrand said he ``contributed'' to the success.
   ``There is no distinction between the government and me in such
a sensitive matter,'' he said.
   Attention also was focused on what would happen immediately
after the election results are known Sunday night.
   For the past two years, Mitterrand and Chirac have been living
in an uneasy marriage, known as ``cohabitation,'' created when the
right ousted the Socialists from control of the National Assembly.
   Chirac's conservatives still have a majority in the Assembly,
whose term does not end until 1991.
   If Chirac wins, the matter is simple. He will continue his
present policies with a government similar to the one now in place.
   But, Mitterrand has the power to dissolve the Assembly and call
new elections. But he has said that if he wins, he will try to work
with the present Parliament and attempt to form a center-left
coalition with wavering center-right deputies.
   If that does not succeed, he will call new elections.
   Most analysts believe that the man Mitterrand names as his
premier will depend on his margin of victory. Two former Socialist
finance ministers, Pierre Beregovoy and Jacques Delors, are
frequently mentioned, as are Jean-Louis Bianco, his chief of staff,
and popular former Agriculture Minister Michel Rocard.
   If the margin is narrow, he could opt for a centrist outside the
ranks of the Socialist Party.
   The surprising strength of extreme right leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen, who won 14.4 percent of the first-round vote, has increased
speculation that some centrists who backed Chirac would join a
Mitterrand coalition.

   Costantino Nivola, a sculptor whose
work ranged from huge bas-relief murals for public buildings to
female figurines on an intimate scale, has died of a heart attack
at the age of 76.
   Nivola died Thursday at Southampton Hospital.
   The native of Italy moved to New York in 1939 with his wife,
Ruth, and became an early champion of modern architecture, serving
as art director for Progressive Architecture and Interiors magazine.
   Among his commissions are a 110-foot-long mural for the Mutual
Insurance Co. of Hartford (Conn.) building; a war memorial in Falls
Church, Va.; a dramatic sand-sculptured wall for the former
Olivetti Co. showroom on Fifth Avenue, now at Harvard; and numerous
sculptures and wall paintings for playgrounds in and around New
York.
   He leaves unfinished a sculptural commission for a combined
police precinct and firehouse in Manhattan.
   His sculpture is currently on view in ``Three Italo-American
Artists,'' an exhibition touring in Italy.
   Nivola is survived by his wife, a son, daughter, four
grandchildren, five sisters and a brother.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of teen-agers decked out in colorful gym
shoes, glittering shirts and black leather gloves gyrated to the
sound of pulsating American rock 'n' roll Saturday in Beijing's
first breakdance contest.
   The two-day competition at the Chongwen District Culture Center
drew 420 dancers, mostly teen-age boys.
   Disco dancing and breakdancing have been critized by Chinese
officials as decadent, and dance halls in some cities have been
closed down. Only recently have authorities given reluctant
approval to the dancing.
   ``The government originally took a policy of banning rock music
and disco, but that was not correct,'' said Li Chunqing, an
official of the culture center. ``If we properly direct the
enthusiasm for breakdancing, it is very healthy.''
   Breakdancing became popular in China last year after the release
of the American film ``Breakdance.''
   There have been reports in the official media of youngsters
skipping school so they can practice their moves.
   ``I hide my breakdancing from my parents,'' said Xie Maojie, 19,
a computer company employee. Xie, wearing a sailor cap, large round
glasses and a thin tie, said he had entered the contest ``just for
the fun of it.''
   ``My parents told me I could breakdance as long as I don't
become crazy about it,'' said 15-year-old Lu Si, a student of opera
and one of the few girls in the competition.
   Most of the dancers wore baggy pants and sweatshirts. Red gym
shoes with military camouflage pants were a popular combination.
Some sported sunglasses, glittering shirts, leg warmers and black
gloves.
   Colored lights flashed from the floor and ceiling of the hall as
the dancers performed in groups of seven and eight for seven
judges. Chen Ailian, a well-known classical dancer, led the judges'
panel.
   The port city of Tianjin sponsored what might have been China's
first breakdance contest in January, and several cities have opened
breakdance classes to try to channel the dancing craze.
   Earlier reports said the far north city of Harbin had started a
dozen breakdance classes and that Beijing has 10 privately run
classes. The official Xinhua News Agency said 200 signed up for one
class of 40 in Beijing.

   Someone started a scavenger hunt that
sent people racing around two cities for objects like mail boxes
and lawn chairs, but the only winners were police officers who lay
in wait for players at a meeting point.
   When it was over officers had dozens of odd items as evidence
and arrested 11 people on theft and burglary charges.
   ``We don't know who staged this, but we'd like to. We don't know
if it was a con or not,'' officer Frank Hartig said of the strange
events late Thursday.
   He said the stage was set sometime during the day when a flier
was distributed that advertised a ``scavenger hunt,'' listing
numerous items that were to be brought to the edge of town by
midnight. The winner would get a prize.
   Police found out about the hunt and ``happened to see a couple
of them driving down the road with some of the items.''
   ``We found out where the meeting was to take place,'' said
Hartig. ``As they came to drop something off, we'd take them out of
there and wait for some more.''
   When the hunt was over, police had nine adults and two juveniles
under arrest and an evidence box stuffed with mail boxes, tennis
court nets, hubcaps, windshield wipers, house plants, pay phone
receivers, house numbers, signs, garbage cans, basketball hoops,
toilet seat covers, lawn chairs and hoses.
   ``That stuff was stolen,'' Hartig said. ``They were vandalizing
and stealing.
   Hartig said the loot was lifted from Benicia and nearby Vallejo.
   ``It would be nice if we had clues to this,'' said Hartig. ``Any
help would be appreciated.'

   One of a set of quintuplets born three months
prematurely has died of complications caused by the early birth, a
hospital spokeswoman said Saturday.
   Rachel Lauren Simunich died Friday afternoon at Magee-Womens
Hospital, said spokeswoman Mary Hughes.
   The parents, Terry Simunich, 26, and her husband, Max, 28, of
Greenville, announced the births April 29. The babies, the
Simunich's first, were delivered during a five-minute span just
before and after midnight April 27.
   Bradley Andrew came first, followed by Emily Marie, Allison
Nicole, Rachel and Kathryn Elizabeth. The girls ranged from 1 pound
8 ounces to 1 pound 10 ounces.
   The couple asked the hospital to withhold details concerning the
infant's death, Ms. Hughes said.
   The remaining four infants were stabilized in critical condition
and were not suffering from complications, Ms. Hughes said. They
may be ready to go home by the end of July, she said.

<HEAD>Hungarian Leader Says Gorbachev Certain to Succeed in Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is certain
to succeed in revamping Soviet society but it could take ``some
tough years,'' predicts Janos Kadar, who has led communist Hungary
for more than three decades.
   Kadar, in a U.S. television interview being broadcast Sunday,
also said there is no internal need for the 64,000 Soviet soldiers
still in Hungary, only ``international reasons.'' Hopefully in the
coming decade, he said, ``relations in Europe will develop in such
a manner that there will be no need for them.''
   The process of perestroika, or restructuring, launched by
Gorbachev ``will be victorious in spite of all the difficulties''
because it means progress for the Soviet people and because ``the
situation is ripe for it,'' Kadar said.
   But there are differences over the pace of change and ``it will
take years before serious results can be seen ... some tough
years,'' said the 75-year-old Hungarian communist party chief whose
reputation as an Eastern block reformer predates that of Gorbachev.
   Kadar talked in Budapest on April 25 with Washington-based
journalist John McLaughlin. The taped interview was scheduled for
broadcast on McLaughlin's ``One on One'' program.
   Kadar became head of the Hungarian Socialist Workers (Communist)
Party after Soviet forces invaded in 1956 to crush a popular
uprising.
   If American forces had intervened in the 1956 upheaval, a
U.S.-Soviet clash would have been inevitable, Kadar said. The West
did not intervene.
   ``I wish that Soviet and American troops never meet anywhere as
enemies in battle,'' he said. ``But as a Hungarian, I desired least
of all that they come into conflict on Hungarian soil,'' he added.
   Kadar, who in Western eyes a villain of the 1956 Hungarian
tragedy, gained a new image in the next three decades as a
dedicated architect of political and economic liberalization aimed
at improving Hungarian life.
   Today, Hungary is one of the more prosperous of the Soviet bloc
countries, one of the easiest to visit for Westerners, including
refugees of 1956, and its citizens have the easiest time leaving.
   Hungarian reform does not serve as a model for Moscow but
Gorbachev admits the Kremlin can learn from Hungary and Soviet
changes make it ``easier for us now,'' Kadar said.
   He acknowledged that the Hungarian economy, after some dynamic
growth, slowed down and started having serious problems seven or
eight years ago, but said ``the path continues to be that of
reform.''
   On the political side, Kadar said Hungary's rulers recognize
today that ``If we cannot convince people about the necessity of
certain steps ... it is possible to decree, but in reality it
cannot be carried out.''
   A Western multiparty system ``cannot be constructed in
Hungary,'' Kadar said. But in June, at the first general party
conference since 1957, efforts will be made to create ``socialist
pluralism'' reducing party control, improving consultation and
giving more responsibility to non-party bodies, he continued.
   The line, however, will be drawn against anarchy, and groups
``working against the system'' will not be legalized, he said.

   After nursery school on a warm spring day,
Jenifer Joyce's children charged into the house carrying octopus
characters with dangling arms made of pink construction paper.
   The 32-year-old woman can relate to lots of arms. She deals with
10 of them every day _ the arms of her 4-year-old quintuplets.
   Full of after-school energy, Christopher, Kevin, Lauren, Megan
and Ryan race to the kitchen to find a box of cheese crackers while
Mrs. Joyce patiently hangs the windbreakers that were peeled off
and left in the front hall.
   Families with five children are not unusual. But circumstances
are different when the five all have the same growing experiences
at the same time: the first tricycle ride, the first trip to the
store.
   Does Mrs. Joyce really pile all five preschoolers into the
family van and take them to the supermarket or the mall?
   ``I try everything at least once,'' she said. ``I'm a great
believer in that they're not going to learn how to behave unless
you try it.
   ``I can sense their moods. There are certain days when I start
out with all five, and I end up turning around and coming home
before I even get there. I can't take a chance with them,
especially when I'm alone.
   ``They're more tiring now because they have all this energy and
they feed off each other. Normal children will die at 8 o'clock at
night and be ready to go to sleep, but all of a sudden one sparks
up and they're all running around the house wanting to play
Superman.
   ``Most of what I do is no different from other people who have
five kids. I don't consider myself a supermom. I assume most
mothers do the same things.''
   About 40 people turned out to help the Joyce family during the
critical first year. The volunteers _ and a loving husband, Jerry,
and live-in mother-in-law _ actually enabled Mrs. Joyce to complete
her college education last year and get a degree in computer
science.
   But instinct has become her strongest talent.
   ``I can spot a glass fall before they even push it or a flying
pancake even before they throw it,'' she said.
   She's doing something right. Her quintuplets are full of energy
but well-mannered and respectful, and especially obedient to their
mother's wishes. Especially when her voice raises.
   ``If they're really bad, I separate them,'' she said.
   An example came immediately to hand. The three boys got into a
``squirt fight'' in the bathroom, and Mrs. Joyce calmly took
Christopher _ the unlucky target _ upstairs to change into clean
clothes.
   Mrs. Joyce said her husband helps a great deal, doing the
laundry every morning before he goes to work as a high school
teacher.
   The worst stage was when the children were born on Aug. 18,
1983, two months premature and weighing from 1 pound, 12 ounces to
about three pounds. Mrs. Joyce had taken a fertility drug often
associated with multiple births.
   ``Nothing was harder than when they were so tiny that you were
saying your prayers every day,'' she said.
   Now, Mrs. Joyce gets some relief while the quints go to nursery
school, but she tries to keep one or two home every day for some
time alone. On a recent day, Christopher was allowed to play with a
toy that had many small parts _ a toy that gets packed away when
the children are together.
   ``When I have just one home like this, they talk non-stop,''
Mrs. Joyce said. ``That one-on-one is important.''
   Despite the push for individuality, Mrs. Joyce does dress the
quintuplets alike sometimes, ``if only for safety reasons. If it's
a crowded place, you can spot them in a minute _ and they can spot
each other.''
   Mother's Day will be like any other day, she said, tending to
the needs of the quintuplets.
   The quints do draw attention, Mrs. Joyce said, ``but that's not
a problem. Most people love children and it's usually a very
amiable response.
   ``I don't mind sharing the joy _ we were blessed and the
children are healthy and happy.''

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Pick Through Rubble Of Soviet-Afghan Garrison</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BARIKOT, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poster of Vladimir I. Lenin peers
out from behind heaps of dusty rubble onto a main street choked
with thousands of Afghan army uniforms.
   The green-and-white flag of the Moslem resistance, hung atop the
old local headquarters of the Soviet army, flaps in the mountain
wind.
   Below, Moslem insurgents pick through the remains of their
prize: the former Soviet-Afghan garrison of Barikot.
   On April 20, anti-communist guerrillas launched a furious rocket
and grenade attack on this strategic post, about a mile west of the
Pakistan border.
   The town soon fell but not before Soviet and Afghan forces fled
in a series of helicopter airlifts.
   Barikot was the first of at least six outposts in eastern
Afghanistan that have fallen to the guerrillas since the Soviets
began pulling away from the region in preparation for their
withdrawal from Afghanistan, set to begin May 15.
   It also opened an important new supply route in the insurgents'
fight to oust the communist government in Kabul.
   ``The fall of Barikot opens the transportation route to the
provinces of Badakshan, Kunduz, Baghlan, Laghman and Parwan,'' said
Commander Lalgul of the Hezb-I-Islami Yunis Khalis faction.
   Those Afghanistan provinces lie to the east, north and west of
Kabul, and include the main route which the Soviets are expected to
take as they head home to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet army entered Afghaninstan eight years ago to replace
one communist administration with another and fight Afghan
guerrillas who opposed the Soviet-backed government in Kabul.
   On April 14, the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw its estimated
115,000 troops from Afghanistan under a plan it signed in Geneva
with Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States. The guerrillas do
not recognize the agreement and have vowed to keep fighting until
they smash the Kabul government.
   The victory at Barikot did much for their cause.
   About 60 percent of this sun-baked town was destroyed in massive
Soviet-Afghan bombings following the evacuation.
   But plenty remains: huge stashes of arms, artillery, ammunition,
armored and conventional military vehicles, and deadly booby traps.
   Guerrillas say as many as 10 returning Afghan refugees were
killed by land mines as they returned to the garrison town from
Pakistan.
   But as the death toll mounted, guerrillas pushed the refugees
back across the precarious wood-plank suspension bridge that spans
the Kunar River to Pakistan and only guerrillas were allowed near
the town.
   Traveling on narrow footpaths, the insurgents keep their eyes on
the ground, searching for booby traps and mines.
   In the grassy, rock-strewn fields around Barikot, remnants of
helicopters rust in the sun. The guerrillas say they were downed
with U.S.-supplied Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.
   ``Commander Shahafullah is the Stinger commander. He shot down a
(Soviet) MiG-27,'' boasted Zahir Khan, a member of the Khalis
faction.
   Lalgul said an old man left behind in the village told him many
villagers were forced to board waiting helicopters at gunpoint.
   When the army served notice that every man, woman and child
would be flown out of Barikot, Lalgul said the old man told him:
   ``Women kissed the wall and asked, `Why do we want to go?'''
   The commander said Afghan militia and army officers were taken
to Mazar-E-Sharif, about 45 miles south of the Soviet border in
order ``to fortify the north.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Guerrillas and Western diplomats have said they believe the
Soviets and Afghanistan's Marxist leaders will create a security
zone in the north in case Kabul falls. Some have even suggested
that the Soviets want to create a ``communist zone'' in the north.
   Despite fears that the seven main guerrilla factions would begin
fighting each other once they defeat the communists, the flags of
four insurgent groups fly in Barikot.
   While members of Khalis' party show off some heavy artillery,
fighters of Gulbaddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-I-Islami crowd into an
abandoned truck to pose for pictures.
   On the road into town, Khalis commanders stop to greet
guerriilas of Burhanuddin Rabbani's Jamiat-I-Islami.
   On the outskirts, Zahir Khan points out the office of Abdul
Sayyaf's Ittihad-I-Islami.
   He dismissed charges that the guerrillas will turn their weapons
on each other.
   ``We are all brothers ... like one hand,'' he said.

   Anti-government rebels have released two
Italian technicians kidnapped six months ago, Italy's ambassador
said Saturday.
   Sudanese authorities told the embassy in Sudan that Salvatore
Barone and Paolo Bellini will arrive soon in Khartoum, where they
will be handed over to Italian officials, according to Ambassador
Franco Lo Prinzi.
   A little-known group called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Party claimed it was behind the Nov. 16 kidnapping in northwestern
Ethiopia.
   The organization said Barone and Bellini were seized because the
project they were working on would strengthen the Ethiopian
government. The Italians were technicans at the Tana-Beles Project,
which aims to build a dike on the Blue Nile and construct roads.
   In Rome, the newspaper La Repubblica said Sudanese authorities
had negotiated with the rebels to win the Italians' release.

<TEXT>
   Siamese twin girls who were
joined at the head until an operation four days ago are out of
intensive care and recovering well, hospital officials said
Saturday.
   Mpho and Mphonyana Mathibela, aged 17 months, were separated in
a 7{-hour operation Tuesday by a 40-member medical team at
Baragwanath Hospital, in a black township outside Johannesburg.
   Mphonyana, the smaller and weaker of the two, required brief
follow-up surgery Wednesday. Her condition has since improved
steadily, and she was taken from the intensive care ward Friday to
join her sister in the neurosurgical ward, hospital officials said.
   Mpho has been eating solid food and taking milk from a bottle,
they said.
   Doctors said that if all goes well, the girls will need only one
more operation sometime before they reach age 6.
   Baragwanath doctors said they took a different approach to
separating the girls than a medical team used at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
   In September, the Johns Hopkins doctors separated West German
Siamese twins also joined at the head in a 22-hour operation. Since
then, Benjamin and Patrick Binder have required a dozen follow-up
operations.
   Both survived and returned to West Germany last month.
   The Baragwanath team led by Dr. Robert Lipschitz instead
performed two preliminary operations in October on the Mathibela
twins. They partially clamped a shared blood vein in hopes that
smaller vessels would take over in each child.
   The preliminary operations allowed the Baragwanath doctors to
separate the girls in a shorter final operation.
   ``We could have used the same technique they did but decided to
do diametrically the opposite because of the problems they hit,''
Lipschitz said.
   Sophie Mathibela, the mother of the twins, is a 33-year-old
unmarried domestic worker who earns about $60 a month. She was
asked to make a $5 contribution to the costs of the operations,
estimated at $700,000.
   The costs are being covered by the hospital and the University
of the Witwatersrand medical school.

<HEAD>Reagan Urges Swift Senate Ratification of Arms Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Saturday urged the Senate
to swiftly ratify a pending arms control treaty and ``enable us to
get on with the job of eliminating these nuclear missiles.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has tentatively
set Wednesday for the start of Senate debate on the treaty, which,
if ratified, would require the elimination of U.S. and Soviet
ground-launched intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear weapons.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the treaty
at their summit in Washington in December, and Reagan submitted it
to the Senate the following month.
   The president said Saturday he is confident that the treaty will
be ratified. He has said previously that he hopes this will be done
before he goes to Moscow for another meeting with Gorbachev on May
29-June 2.
   The two superpowers are currently negotiating another treaty,
dealing with longer-range intercontinental missiles, but that pact
is not expected to be completed before the Moscow summit.
   Reagan's remarks, in his weekly radio address, made no reference
to Byrd's demand for written assurances that the treaty will cover
futuristic weapons, like those using laser rays.
   An administration official, however, speaking on condition he
not be identified, said the issue has been discussed with the
Soviets and is currently being discussed with Senate leaders. The
official said the administration was confident an accomodation
could be reached.
   Reagan spoke from Camp David, the presidential retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains of Maryland.
   ``It is my hope that, in recognition of the important role they
play in this process, the 100 members of the United States Senate
will now proceed expeditiously in their debate,'' he said. ``Senate
appoval of the treaty will enable us to get on with the job of
eliminating these nuclear missiles.''
   Reviewing the history of the pact, the president said, ``We held
fast to what we wanted, and we got it. And this is what comes from
negoitiating from strength. It's the same successful formula,
dealing from strength, that we're applying to our other
negotiations with the Soviet Union as well.''
   ``I can assure you if we don't get what we want in these other
areas, if we don't get good treaties, there will be no treaties,''
he said.
   ``Now that the treaty is moving to floor debate in the Senate,
let the debate be vigorous and full,'' the president said. ``And
let it proceed without delay. For I'm confident that the final vote
will indeed give advice and consent to this historic treaty.''

<HEAD>Thousands Of Indians Expected For Second Major Cultural Event</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pounding of drums and the tinkle of
bells will replace the usual hustle of downtown Oklahoma City next
month as hundreds of Indian performers and artists and thousands of
spectators congregate for Red Earth '88.
   It's being billed as the world's largest Indian celebration, and
the centerpiece is a three-day, $50,000 dance competition expected
to draw as many as 900 contestants. In addition, there will be
Indian arts and crafts for sale, a parade, and demonstrations of
traditional Indian games.
   Last year's Red Earth gathering, the first, drew tourists from
as far away as Europe and Japan. This year's gathering begins June
2.
   Dancers will compete in various categories bearing such esoteric
names as the Southern straight dance, men's Northern traditional,
the fancy shawl dance, fancy war dance, ladies traditional
buckskin, ladies cloth and the jingle dress dance.
   Jim Anquoe, powwow chairman, cited the jingle dress dance as an
example of how the event has fostered cultural exchange. The dance
style was introduced to Southern Plains Indian women last year by
their northern counterparts.
   Red Earth '87 was the first time that Southern and Northern
Plains Indians shared the same arena with their different styles of
dancing and singing, he said.
   ``Last year's powwow came close to combining the North and the
South,'' Anquoe said. ``The Northern Plains Indians and the
Southern Plains Indians really never got together.''
   This year, dancers are expected from as far away as Florida,
Wisconsin, Washington and Oregon, while drum groups from Canada,
Montana, North and South Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Iowa, Arizona, New
Mexico and Oklahoma will participate, he said.
   In addition to the performances, nearly 80 of the nation's top
Indian artists will display their wares at the fine arts exhibit
and sale. There will be paintings, silver and turquoise jewelry,
sculpture, pottery and Indian cultural items such as kachina dolls,
the hand-carved dolls representing the spirits that guide the Hopi.
   As many as 200 Indian craftsmen and women are expected to be on
hand to sell jewelry, pottery, beadwork, clothing and other
handmade items.
   Red Earth will kick off Thursday evening, June 2, with a buffalo
barbeque and a preview and auction of the fine art. It is scheduled
to run through Sunday, June 5.

   Here are facts and figures on France's runoff
election on Sunday between President Francois Mitterrand and

<TEXT>
   This is the second round of voting, limited to the two
candidates who finished first and second in the first round April
24. The results of that election were: Mitterrand (Socialist) 34.1
percent, Chirac (conservative) 19.9 percent, Raymond Barre
(centrist) 16.6 percent, Jean-Marie Le Pen (extreme-right) 14.4
percent, Andre Lajoinie (Communist), 6.8 percent, Antoine Waechter
(ecologist) 3.8 percent, Pierre Juquin (splinter Communist) 2.1
percent, Arlette Laguiller (Trotskyist) 2.0 percent, Pierre Boussel
(Trotskyist) 0.4 percent.
   Presidential candidates distance themselves from their own
parties in order to attract supporters of other parties.
   Since a center-right coalition won the March 1986 legislative
elections, Chirac and Mitterrand have been governing uncomfortably
together in a power-sharing arrangement called ``cohabitation.'' If
Chirac wins, he will have control of both power centers. If
Mitterrand wins, he will still have to find a way of governing with
a right-leaning assembly _ or else call new legislative elections
in hope of a victory by the left.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE ISSUES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Chirac and Mitterrand have few important differences in foreign
policy. In economic affairs, Chirac would continue privatization of
state-owned firms, which Mitterrand says he would halt. Mitterrand
would re-establish the Socialist wealth tax, abolished under
Chirac, and use the proceeds for a minumum guaranteed income.
   Just when it seemed Chirac had no chance of winning, his
government engineered the liberation of the last three French
hostages in Lebanon, the assault freeing police held hostage in New
Caledonia, and the popular return of a French spy from exile in the
Pacific.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE POLLS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   No polls may be published in the campaign's final week. The last
surveys showed Mitterrand winning 53 percent to 57 percent of the
vote, but they could be out of date.

   A thousand Melanesian separatists
marched Saturday in the capital of this French Pacific territory to
protest the killing of 19 kidnappers during a dramatic rescue of 23
French lawmen.
   About 500 policemen lined the streets in Noumea, but no violence
was reported during the five-hour march and rally.
   About 7,000 French police and military personnel remained on
full alert Saturday, although the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, the main separatist group, said it would not
disrupt voting Sunday in the French presidential runoff.
   The first round of voting April 24 was marked by shooting, the
erection of barricades and threats of violence that kept some
polling stations closed.
   During that election, voters also chose a local territorial
council which the separatists oppose. The council is part of an
administrative plan for the archipelego set up by conservative
Premier Jacques Chirac, who received 74.6 percent of the
territory's first-round vote.
   Extreme right National Front candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen
received 12.3 percent of the vote. Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand, who Chirac faces in Sunday's runoff, garnered 4.9
percent of the vote.
   Two days before ballotting, Melanesian separatists stormed a
police station on the island of Ouvea, northeast of New Caledonia's
main island, killing four gendarmes and abducting 27 others.
   Twelve hostages were later released, but on April 27, eight
lawmen were seized while they attempted to negotiate for the
release of the other hostages, held in a cave on the north coast of
Ouvea.
   On Thursday, police stormed the cave and freed the hostages,
killing 19 of the kidnappers. Two members of the assualt team also
died. Five people were injured.
   In Paris, 57 gendarmes arrived on a commercial flight from New
Caledonia on Saturday and were greeted by Defense Minister Andre
Giraud. Among the gendarmes were 10 who had been injuried in the
latest wave of violence that began April 22.
   The gendarmes preceded Bernard Pons, minister for overseas
territories, who left Noumea for Paris on Saturday, saying his
mission had been completed with the freeing of the hostages.
   ``If I am sad because there were some dead, I also say that
those who attack someone, who attack a bank, who commit a terrorist
act, take some risks and should be ready to assume them,'' Pons
told reporters before leaving.
   Yeiwene Yeiwene, second-ranking leader of the liberation
movement, accused France of choosing blood over mediation.
   ``The nationalist Kanaks never wanted to kill the hostages. They
had all the means, they had all the time to do so had they wished.
But there were no hostages killed,'' Yeiwene said in an interview
on Radio Djiido. ``The massacre was perpetrated deliberately by Mr.
Pons, who knew ... that there was no question of killing the
hostages.''
   Speaking to separatists at the rally, liberation front spokesman
Leopold Joredie, said ``It it because the Kanak people have been
cornered that some of our sons chose the action on Ouvea.''
   Joredie said reports from separatists on Ouvea indicated that
some of the kidnappers were hunted down and killed after the attack
at the cave.
   A French armed forces spokesman denied the allegation.
   French authorities have promised that the 27 people arrested in
connection with the Ouvea kidnapping would remain in the territory
for trial. Since April 22, 49 people have been arrested for acts of
separatist violence in the territory.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 36 percent of the
145,000 inhabitants of the territory. Forty-three percent are
European settlers, with the rest of the population made up of
Asians and Polynesians.
   New Caledonia was colonized by France in 1853.

   A French diplomat freed after three years'
captivity in Lebanon was hospitalized with a nervous condition
Saturday after telling of mock executions and describing the
harrowing experiences of foreign hostages.
   Marcel Fontaine, 45, was released Wednesday by his pro-Iranian
captors in Beirut along with fellow diplomat Marcel Carton, 64, and
journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44.
   Carton and Kauffmann were recuperating with their families.
   Carton's daughter, Simone El-Khoury, said her father was happy
but exhausted and had given up hope of freedom when he was finally
freed.
   ``He didn't believe in it anymore. He was completely depressed,
crying all the time. He was chained, locked up, without sun, always
blindfolded,'' Mrs. El-Khoury told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from her home in Collonge-Bellerive, a Geneva
suburb.
   Carton got the first glimpse of his 3-year-old granddaughter
Joumana, born to Mrs. El-Khoury shortly before he was kidnapped on
March 22, 1985, with Fontaine.
   Kauffmann, a reporter for the weekly magazine L'Evenement du
Jeudi, left for a few days vacation at an undisclosed location in
the French countryside, according to his employer. He was kidnapped
May 22, 1985.
   Fontaine's wife, Elaine, said her husband began to get very
nervous Friday night. He went to see a doctor Saturday who ordered
a ``period of decompression'' in the Val de Grace military hospital.
   Fontaine, Carton and Kauffmann returned to France on Thursday
and spent two days at Val de Grace undergoing extensive medical
tests.
   Fontaine, interviewed Friday night by the French radio station
Europe 1, said his worst moments during captivity came when his
kidnappers staged mock executions, holding a pistol to his neck,
then firing another weapon to frighten him.
   He said they accused him of being a spy for the CIA and Israel.
   ``The tribunal has convicted you,'' he said he was told on one
occasion. ``You will be executed this evening.''
   ``They put a hood on me and faced me to the wall. One of them
put a pistol to my neck and another fired a gun behind me,'' he
said.
   Fontaine said he was blindfolded by day and chained during much
of his time in captivity. Conditions improved in the last six
months when he was kept in an apartment, his bed was made, the
floor vacuumed and he was allowed to watch some television.
   A spokesman for the American Embassy in Paris said U.S.
officials had spoken with Fontaine for three hours about the nine
Americans still being held by Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon,
including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press.
   Anderson, kidnapped March 16, 1985, is the longest-held of the
18 foreign hostages.
   The embassy refused to disclose details of the talks, which were
conducted in the presence of French officials. The spokesman said
the U.S. officials hoped to interview Carton and Kauffmann in the
next few days.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo made public his schedule of
appointments for the past five years, all 10 volumes of 'em, minus
what his aides termed ``personal meetings or events.''
   While New Yorkers still don't know when the governor has
breakfast with his mother or how many times he saw a doctor in 1986
for a pinched nerve, they do know that he got his hair cut at
Albany's ``Scissor Wizard'' at 8:30 a.m. Dec. 22, 1984.
   The schedules were made public after news organizations filed
requests under the state's freedom of information law, which allows
deletions from records to prevent ``an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy.''
   Cuomo made a surprise visit to reporters hunched over the
records Friday, joking that the material had been censored so the
public wouldn't learn about his partygoing.
   ``If it's a long party, it's a big space,'' he said.
   The logs show Cuomo's devotion to detail.
   ``Turn watch ahead six hours,'' reads an entry for Sept. 20,
1987, the day Cuomo flew to Germany on his way to the Soviet Union
_ a visit that set tongues wagging that he was still thinking of
running for president.
   They also show his devotion to the notion that practice makes
perfect. He practices for the things you would expect,
inaugurations and major speeches. But Cuomo, a former minor league
baseball player, also schedules team practices before games against
the reporters who cover him at the state Capitol.

Public Service, wondered if officials were honoring the right man.
   ``I have the uncomfortable feeling that you all have made some
kind of mistake,'' said Kuralt, whose ``On the Road'' spots have
been a CBS staple since 1967.
   In ceremonies Friday on the steps of the Truman Library, Kuralt
observed that other recipients of the annual award given by the
city of Independence have made serious contributions to the
country. Previous winners include the likes of Coretta Scott King
and Henry Kissinger.
   ``I have merely wandered around it in an old bus for 20 years or
so, feeling the seasons change,'' Kuralt said.
   Mayor Barbara Potts told a crowd of about 500 that the selection
of Kuralt was meant ``to focus attention on Harry Truman's
affection for grass-roots America.''
   Kuralt met President Truman at age 14, when the
broadcaster-to-be was a winner of a national writing and speaking
contest. Kuralt said he was struck by ``the broadness of his smile,
the genuineness of how he seemed to want to know a little something
about each one of us.''

   Comedian Robin Williams, whose portrayal of a
frenetic armed forces disc jockey in ``Good Morning, Vietnam''
garnered an Oscar nomination, has been presented with American
Cinematheque's annual achievement award.
   Among those who attended the awards ceremony at the group's
annual Moving Picture Ball on Friday were entertainers Billy
Crystal and Johnny Carson, actor Roger Moore, and 1987's Oscar
recipient for best actress, Marlee Matlin.
   Williams ``is one of the most impressive talents working today
in any medium,'' said director Sydney Pollack, chairman of American
Cinematheque, a non-profit group devoted to promoting movies.
   ``His impact on the entertainment industry in just a few short
years has been staggering,'' Pollack said.
   Williams is the third entertainer to receive the award. Previous
winners were comedian-actor Eddie Murphy and singer-actress Bette
Midler.
   Proceeds from Friday's $250-per-ticket event were to be used to
build a cultural center devoted to motion pictures.

   U.S. District Judge Earl Carroll stood and
applauded with the rest of the audience when Gov. Rose Mofford
showed up in his courtroom to welcome newly naturalized U.S.
citizens, but he wasn't above tweaking her a little later.
   ``We not only respect our governor, we love her,'' Carroll told
the new citizens and other guests Friday.
   Then he reminded them that a bar association was offering a
``No-bill Day'' Saturday in which anyone could get free legal
advice.
   ``Knowing some of the problems she's had, Governor Mofford may
reserve one of her days _ a whole day _ for that purpose,'' he said.
   Mrs. Mofford is under investigation over omissions from
financial disclosure statements she was required to file with the
secretary of state's office, first as secretary of state and lately
as governor. She has said they were honest mistakes involving
financial dealings with her ex-husband.
   Sworn in were 59 new citizens from 29 countries.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address, delivered Saturday from Camp David, Md:
   My fellow Americans, next week the full United States Senate is
expected to begin floor debate on the treaty on intermediate-range
nuclear forces, known as the INF treaty. You'll recall that Soviet
General Secretary (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and I signed this treaty
at our summit meeting in Washington last December. The treaty
represents a landmark accomplishment, an historic accomplishment,
because once implemented, it will bring about the elimination of an
entire class of American and Soviet nuclear missiles.
   Before our nation can commit itself to a treaty, our
Constitution provides that the Senate must give its advice and
consent, and therefore, last January, I formally submitted the INF
treaty to the Senate for its consideration. The duty of the Senate
in giving its advice and consent to treaties is vital to
maintaining our separation of powers, and the role of the Senate in
considering the INF treaty is essential.
   Senior officials of the administration have been working closely
with the Senate. Officials from our State and Defense departments,
our intelligence community, and our arms control agency, have
provided many hours of testimony before three separate Senate
committees, painstakingly responding to the detailed questions
posed to them by the senators on these committees.
   In addition, senators have addressed to the administration
numerous letters about the treaty and more than 1,200 written
questions; we have provided full written responses. So, you'll see
that we've worked very hard to meet any Senate concerns over the
treaty. And as I've assured the Senate, we'll continue to do so.
   Now that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved the
INF treaty, the entire Senate will be called on to discharge its
constitutional responsibility to provide its advice and consent to
the INF treaty. As this debate is about to begin in the historic
Senate chamber, permit me to take a moment to review you through
the treaty's background.
   The INF treaty is the result of years of hard work by American
officials _ officials, who in representing you in our negotiations
with the Soviet Union, held fast to the key security objectives
that had been set out for the United States and our NATO allies. At
one point, the Soviet Union actually walked away from the table and
stayed away from the talks for almost a year and a half.
   When in early 1985 the Soviets finally returned, we repeated our
call for the elimination of this entire class of U.S. and Soviet
missiles _ my zero option proposal, first put forward all the way
back in 1981. And in 1987, it was the Soviet Union that finally,
after two and a half more years of negotiating, came around to the
American position.
   To sum up in the INF negotiations, we held fast to what we
wanted and we got it, and this is what comes when negotiating from
strength. It's the same successful formula, dealing from strength,
that we're applying to our other negotiations with the Soviet Union
as well. And I assure you, if we don't get what we want in these
other areas _ in other words, if we do not get good treaties _
there will be no treaties.
   It's my hope that in recognition of the important role they play
in this process, the 100 members of the United States Senate will
now proceed expeditiously in their debate on the INF treaty. It is
after all a solid treaty, carefully negotiated, a treaty that
stands on its own substantive merits, a treaty that will enhance
the security of our country and that of our European and Asian
allies now threatened by the various Soviet missiles that will be
removed once the treaty is implemented.
   Senate approval of the treaty will enable us to get on with the
job of eliminating these nuclear missiles. It will also allow us to
put into action the elaborate verification regime that we achieved
in the INF treaty. The most stringent in arms control history, it
will enable us to verify effectively that the Soviets are indeed
complying with all of the treaty's provisions.
   I know that you, the American people, strongly support this INF
treaty. And on Capitol Hill, the House of Representatives has
already given the treaty its endorsement by an overwhelming vote of
393 to 7. Now that the treaty is moving to floor debate in the
Senate, let the debate be vigorous and full and let it proceed
without delay. For I'm confident that the final vote will indeed
give advice and consent to this historic treaty, the historic step
toward a safer peace.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   If the 120-year-old West Virginia
Penitentiary is ever put up for sale, the Hare Krishna community
might want to buy it, raze it and then raise elephants, the sect's
newsletter says.
   The Krishnas also could use the prison kitchen to feed the
homeless and take blocks from its sandstone walls for new
buildings, according to the April issue of New Vrindaban Worldwide.
   The state Supreme Court has found conditions at the prison
unconstitutional and appointed a special master to make periodic
reports. One of the special master's suggestions was that the
prison be sold and another one built.
   The prison was the scene of a New Year's Day 1986 riot in which
three convicts were killed. Three other inmates also were killed
later during 1986.
   ``If the Penitentiary did go up for sale, what do the devotees
propose to do with it? Well, it has a modern kitchen. It could be
turned into a center for the homeless to expand our Food for Life
program,'' said the Krishna newsletter, portions of which appeared
in the Moundsville Daily Echo last week.
   ``Maybe we'll tear down the walls to use for building, keep the
kitchen for the homeless and use the land for an elephant reserve.
If you have any ideas, we'd be glad to hear them. How about the
Moundsville Castle of Understanding?''
   The Krishnas are based in nearby New Vrindaban. The newspaper
noted that their presence has caused some distress among other
Marshall County residents, and a sale of the prison might draw
opposition from those who oppose expanded Krishna holdings.

<HEAD>Official Says First Space Shuttle Probably Will Be Manned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first flight of the Soviet Union's space
shuttle, which officials previously have said would be unmanned,
probably will carry two crew members, the official Tass news agency
said Saturday.
   ``The Soviet reusable spaceship will probably be carrying two
persons on its maiden flight, just as the U.S. space shuttle did on
its test mission,'' Tass quoted Vladimir Shatalov, chief of
cosmonaut training, as saying.
   On March 18, Alexander Dunayev, head of the Soviet space agency
Glavkosmos, told a news conference that scientists were working
around the clock to prepare for the first launch of the space
shuttle before June.
   He said at the time that the initial flight would be unmanned,
and implied that the Soviet Union was more concerned about the
safety of its space crews than the United States.
   ``We pursue the fundamental objective: whether man is alive or
dead after the flight. On the basis of that we regard the
fundamental differences between the Soviet direction of development
and the U.S. part of development,'' he said.
   The U.S. space shuttle program was grounded after the explosion
of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986 that killed all
seven crewmembers.
   Western experts say the Soviets also have lost crews on space
missions and in training. The Soviet space effort traditionally has
been shrouded in secrecy, and little information has been released.
   Tass quoted Shatalov as saying the shape of the Soviet space
shuttle is similar to that of the U.S. craft since both must
perform like a supersonic airplane when returning to Earth.
   But Shatalov was quoted as saying that while the United States
has a booster rocket specifically designed to launch its shuttle,
the Soviets are launching theirs with the more powerful Energia
booster, which also can be used to send other payloads into space.
   Tass did not say when the shuttle would be launched.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite moslem militias fought
fierce street battles Saturday for control of south Beirut's slums,
where extremists are believed to hold most of the 18 foreign
hostages.
   Police said 51 people were killed and 70 wounded.
   Using tanks, howitzers and mortars, pro-Syrian Amal militia
squads battled bands from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God, for the second day. They also made grenade-throwing forays
into each other's territory, police said.
   Ambulances evacuated some casualties as the thud of exploding
shells echoed across Beirut. Thick smoke billowed from burning
apartment blocks in several parts of the densely populated district.
   But the intensity of the battle in the labyrinthine slums, a
traditional Hezbollah stronghold, prevented Lebanese Red Cross and
civil defense teams from evacuating many of the wounded, who lay
bleeding on the streets.
   Saturday's victims raised the casualty toll to 67 killed and 120
injured. The violence began before dawn Friday and appeared part of
an Amal drive to crush its main rival.
   Hospitals packed with wounded issued urgent appeals for blood.
   Civilians caught in the cross fire, who have huddled in
basements and bomb shelters since Friday, tried to flee when food
and water began running out.
   Syrian soldiers, deployed in neighboring west Beirut in February
last year to end three years of anarchy, watched from sandbagged
positions as refugees scampered from their undergound hiding places.
   Reporters saw a dozen women, children and old men carrying
mattresses and clothes duck sniper fire to dart across the main
street in the Ghobeiri neighborhood to safety.
   ``We've been in the basement since before dawn Friday,'' said
Azzam Abdallah as he shepherded his twin daughters and wife Ilham,
all clad in nightgowns, into the Syrian position on the western
edge of the battle zone.
   ``We ran out of food. We ran out of milk for the children,''
said Adballah, who works as a taxi driver at Beirut airport.
   Abdallah's 7-year-old daughters, Joumana and Zaynab, were too
scared to say anything. They rushed into a black Mercedes stopped
by a Syrian soldier who ordered the driver to take the family to
``any safe area.''
   A police spokesman said Amal gunners pounded intersections
linking the neighborhoods of Haret Heik, Bir el-Abed and Hay Madi,
Hezbollah's three main strongholds, to try to block Hezbollah's
supply lines.
   The ferocity of the fighting forced the senior Shiite cleric in
Lebanon, Sheik Mmohammed Mahdi Shamseddine, to evacuate his
residence in Haret Hreik, police said.
   The fighting raged despite cease-fire calls from Shamseddine and
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's reputed spiritual
guide.
   ``My sons, I call upon you to stop this war in which there is no
victor,'' Fadlallah said in an appeal broadcast throughout south
Beirut over loudspeaker systems in mosques.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for Shiite
factions holding foreign hostages in Lebanon, and many of those
released in the past three years have said they were held in south
Beirut at one time or another. There was no word as to whether the
latest fighting endangered the captives.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, sent 7,500 troops into
Moslem west Beirut on Feb. 22, 1987, in a bid to end three years of
war.
   But the Syrians have not moved into the Shiite stronghold of
south Beirut, apparently to avoid a head-on collision with Iran's
allies.
   The Amal-Hezbollah clashes were the heaviest between the two
sides since Amal cracked down on Hezbollah forces last month.
Sixty-two people were killed and 150 wounded in that four-day
confrontation in south Lebanon.
   The latest confrontation began Friday when four Amal militiamen
were killed in an ambush in south Beirut. Amal blamed Hezbollah for
the deaths.
   Police said incendiary shells scored direct hits on several
apartments in south Beirut, starting dozens of fires. Firefighters
could not approach because of the violence.
   Police said most of the estimated 250,000 residents of south
Beirut spent the night in basements and bomb shelters as gunmen
fought it out in the narrow alleys.
   Machine gun fire blocked the main highway leading to Beirut
international airport on the southwestern edge of the disputed
region. However, passengers managed to reach the facility through
side streets, and flight schedules were not affected, police said.
   Also in Beirut, U.S. State Department emissary April Glaspie
briefed Lebanon's Moslem leaders on efforts exerted by the Reagan
administration to end the Lebanese crisis.
   ``We as Americans are always hopeful we can do something to
assist all the Lebanese to put an end to their tragedy,'' Glaspie
told reporters after meeting with Sunni Moslem acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss.
   In south Lebanon, two Israeli-backed militiamen were killed
Saturday when a roadside bomb exploded, knocking out their armored
personnel carrier, U.N. sources said.
   They said gunners of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia responded by shelling three nearby villages, but a casualty
report was not available.

   Ecuadorean voters on Sunday choose between
two left-leaning candidates to replace conservative President Leon
Febres Cordero, Washington's closest ally in South America.
   The election pits Rodrigo Borja, a law professor and leader of
the Democratic Left party, against Abdala Bucaram, a fiery,
foul-mouthed campaigner from the tough port city of Guayaquil.
   Borja and Bucaram, leader of the populist Roldosista Party,
qualified for the presidential runoff by coming in first and second
respectively in a field of 10 candidates in Jan. 31 elections.
Borja received 20 percent of the vote to Bucaram's 15 percent.
   Newspapers have criticized the candidates for conducting a
campaign of personal insults rather than debating the issues, and
campaign violence has left three men dead and more than a dozen
wounded in clashes between armed bands of supporters.
   ``For the love of God stop insulting one another,'' Monsignor
Bernardino Echeverria, a Roman Catholic leader, said in an appeal
to Bucaram and Borja.
   Bucaram, the 36-year-old heir to a political dynasty of Lebanese
immigrants who settled in Guayaquil, set the tone for the campaign
by calling his foe a drunkard, drug addict and atheist. He also
used street language to question Borja's virility.
   Borja, a 52-year-old urbane politician from Quito, the highland
capital, responded with insults of his own. He has accused Bucaram
of having a ``whorehouse vocabulary'' and being a ``fascist
ignoramus.''
   Borja's party, which espouses a social democratic ideology, is
the country's largest, and he is favored to win in most public
opinion polls. But political analysts say Bucaram cannot be counted
out, noting that 25 percent of the voters were still undecided in
the final week of the campaign.
   Borja has pledged to reverse Febres Cordero's free-market
economic policies and seek close ties to the non-aligned movement.
   Bucaram, couching his campaign in appeals to the country's
millions of poor, has vowed to raise taxes on the rich and ``punish
the oligarchy.'' He has promised to provide free shoes to all poor
children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum wage
to $55.
   Bucaram is a former mayor of Guayaquil who gained a huge
following among slum dwellers by paving streets and providing
drinking water and other essential services to shantytowns.
   ``A vote for me is the same as throwing excrement in the face of
the oligarchy,'' he said throughout his campaign.
   His opponents have accused him of making demagogic, inflammatory
appeals to the poor, and strong rumors have circulated for months
that he will be ousted in a military coup if elected.
   This Colorado-sized nation of 10 million people returned to
democratic rule in 1979 after a decade of civilian and military
dictatorships.
   Febres Cordero, whose four-year term ends in August, has had a
stormy relationship with the leftist and populist parties that
controlled congress. He had to put down a rebellion by an air force
commander halfway through his presidency.
   The candidate of his Social Christian Party fared poorly in the
January elections, coming in third. The poor showing was viewed as
a sign of the low popularity of the government.
   The economy shrank in 1987 by 3.5 percent, and inflation is
expected to climb to at least 50 percent this year, the highest
level since 1983.
   Febres Cordero's supporters blame the decline on the sharp drop
in the price of oil, Ecuador's main source of income, and economic
damage from a devastating earthquake in March 1987.

<HEAD>Democrats: Trade Bill Veto Would Play Into Hands Of Foreign
Interests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trade bill veto would play into the hands of
foreign governments who conducted massive lobbying against the
measure, a Democratic lawmaker said Saturday in response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said the bill would ``stop trade
cheating by foreign nations'' and urged Reagan to sign the
legislation.
   Reagan has said he plans to veto the bill because of a plant
closing notification provision.
   The bill would overhaul the nation's system for imposing import
curbs to retaliate against international trade violations and aid
American industries threatened by stepped-up foreign competition.
   Supporters say the revised rules would force other nations,
particularly Japan, Korea and Taiwan, to open their markets to U.S.
goods.
   ``Every citizen should urge President Reagan to sign the trade
bill,'' said Riegle, an author of some of the bill's provisions.
   He cited an estimate by the New York Federal Reserve Board that
the United States within three years will owe the rest of the world
$1 trillion, and noted that the trade deficit was building each
year.
   ``We must reverse the trade deficit now. We must stop this
massive debt accumulation, and keep our jobs and our money from
hemorrhaging overseas,'' he said.
   Riegle urged Reagan ``to reject the massive lobbying power of
foreign governments and companies, who have gotten rich on unfair
trade'' and who worked ``day and night to kill this trade bill.''
   ``Many nations will not let U.S. products be sold in their
countries. Yes, they sell to us, but they refuse to buy from us,''
Riegle said.
   He cited the failure last week of negotiations between the
United States and Japan over Japanese restrictions on imports of
beef and oranges.
   ``Just this week they said `no' again to U.S. beef and citrus
products. That's wrong, and it must be changed,'' Riegle said.
   Riegle said the trade crisis ``threatens every job in America.''
He said the plant-closing provision that prompted Reagan's veto
promise is necessary to help workers prepare for ``the shock of a
major job loss.''
   The provision would require all but the smallest employers to
provide 60-day notice of closings and large-scale layoffs. The
administration opposes the provision, saying it would cramp U.S.
economic growth and encourage companies to locate elsewhere by
adding new federal regulation.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., should fully
recover from Saturday's rare double-lung transplant before
November, when voters have to decide whether to give him a 10th
term in office, his doctor said.
   ``I think the Congressman has tremendous spirit. He wants to do
things. I suspect his recovery period should be very short,'' said
the leader of the University of Mississippi Medical Center
transplant team, Dr. Seshadri Raju.
   Raju said the 60-year-old Spence was on a respirator in critical
but stable condition after five hours of surgery concluded about 3
a.m. Saturday.
   Spence suffered from chronic obstructive lung disease, a
hereditary and debilitating illness that doctors say would have
taken his life without the transplant.
   ``If everything goes satisfactorily, I think he will be
recovered much, much earlier than that (November),'' Raju said. The
congressman should be able to take calls from his bed ``within a
week a two I'm sure, maybe sooner.''
   Prior to the surgery, Raju had said Spence would be able to
resume a normal schedule within six months with ``surprisingly
little'' in the way of physical restrictions.
   Spence had awakened from the anesthesia by noon Saturday and was
visited by his fiancee, 37-year-old Deborah Williams of Lexington,
S.C., said the congressman's press secretary, Randy Mashburn.
Spence is a widower.
   The congressman's four sons also were with him, Mashburn said.
   However, Mashburn declined to comment on the possibility the
congressman would be campaigning before his November contest
against Democratic challenger Jim Leventis.
   ``I don't want to answer any political questions right now. We
just want to get this man healthy and back on his feet,'' Mashburn
said.
   Confined at times to a wheelchair and occasionally in need of
oxygen, Spence has made few public appearances since last October,
when he went on a list of potential organ transplant recipients.
   The hospital is a member of an organ donor network that seeks to
match organs with recipients, medical center spokeswoman Barbara
Austin said.
   Spence's new lungs were flown in from a donor in Tyler, Texas,
and Friday night Spence was flown to Jackson.
   ``Floyd had been meeting with his constitutents in his
congressional office (in Columbia, S.C.) all afternoon when his
beeper went off,' Mashburn said. ``We took off.''
   Double-lung transplants have been performed 30 times worldwide
and only 13 times in North America, Austin said.
   The Jackson hospital has now done four of the transplants, but
two of the patients died. Medical Center officials attributed one
of the deaths to factors unrelated to either the surgery or
respiratory ailments.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response
Saturday to President Reagan's weekly radio address.
   This is Senator Don Riegle from Michigan. If you work for a
living, or have children or other family members who work for a
living, then you have a vital stake in the trade bill just passed
by Congress.
   America today faces a trade crisis. That trade crisis threatens
every job in America. There's an urgent need to change our trade
laws in order to save and create American jobs.
   Congress has passed a strong trade bill that will strengthen
America and stop other nations from cheating us in world trade. We
need this law _ and every citizen should urge President Reagan to
sign the trade bill.
   Listen to these figures. Our trade deficit as a nation is
running at the rate of $166 billion a year. The most recent monthly
trade deficit was so bad it knocked the stock market down over 100
points in a single day. We have become the largest debtor nation,
and are adding new international debt at the rate of $1 billion
every two and a half days. That's right _ $1 billion of new foreign
debt every two and a half days. This poses great dangers to our
future.
   The New York Federal Reserve Board says that within three years,
we will owe the rest of the world $1 trillion. A trillion dollars
is a thousand billion. It's incredible.
   We must reverse the trade deficit now. We must stop this massive
debt accumulation _ and keep our jobs and our money from
hemorrhagging overseas.
   Now, here's what the trade bill will do _ first, it will stop
trade cheating by foreign nations. Many nations will not let U.S.
products be sold in their countries. They sell to us _ but refuse
to buy from us. Japan alone is running a $60 billion trade surplus
with the United States _ and draining $5 billion of capital a month
from our economic system.
   Yet Japan will not allow many U.S. products to be sold in Japan.
Just this week they said ``no'' again to U.S. beef and citrus
products. That's wrong, and it must be changed.
   This trade bill requires fair, open, two-way trade. We must
insist on fair trade _ if we're going to preserve America's
economic strength and our leadership in the world.
   The trade bill also provides needed help and retraining for U.S.
workers who lose their jobs because of the trade invasion. Now that
makes good sense. No American worker should be thrown on the scrap
heap. We should help every citizen remain productive and
self-sufficient. It is a responsibility we have to each other.
   Another key provision of the trade bill requires 60 days advance
notice when large plant closings or layoffs are going to take
place. That's only fair. Workers and communities need this advance
warning to prepare for the shock of a major job loss. Maybe a way
can be found to prevent the closing.
   Companies that cannot foresee the closing ahead of time are
exempt from this new law. Advance notice makes good sense.
Management, workers and communities should share this information
for the good of all. We must care about each other _ and really
work as a team, if we're going to increase productivity, lift our
living standard and fight off foreign competition. If management
knows ahead of time that a plant will close, why shouldn't workers
and the community?
   Overall then, the trade bill insists on fair trading rules and
helps our country adjust to the tough new demands of world
competition.
   Mr. President, we urge you to listen to the American people and
to the large bipartisan majority in Congress that wrote this vital
trade bill. Our economic future is at stake.
   We ask you to sign the bill. Let's give America the tools it
needs to sell overseas and stop the massive mortgage of foreign
debt being strapped on every person in America. Let's act while
there's still time.
   We ask you to stand up for our country, to stand up for trade
fairness, to stand up for the job future of every young person in
America. We can win _ if the trade rules are fair.
   We ask you to reject the massive lobbying power of foreign
governments and companies _ who have gotten rich on unfair trade _
and who are working day and night to kill this trade bill with a
presidential veto.
   Mr. President _ sign the trade bill into law and give us all the
chance to build a strong economic future the old-fashioned American
way: top notch individual effort, teamwork and fair rules. American
can win _ if we have a fair chance.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Denounces Poland's Crackdown on Strikers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department's No. 2 officer on
Saturday denounced Poland's crackdown on strikers and said U.S.
backing for that government's economic recovery plan will remain
frozen until the program wins popular support.
   ``We have to condemn the violence, imprisonments, the beatings
that are reported to be taking place,'' Deputy Secretary of State
John C. Whitehead said. ``The situation there is very sad.''
   Whitehead also said that during a trip to Algeria this week he
will urge leaders to see that the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner,
who might still be in Algeria, are ``brought to justice.''
   U.S. officials disclosed earlier last week that U.S. support for
Poland's economic programs would flag unless the Polish government
resumes a dialogue with labor groups, but in an interview with
three reporters, Whitehead defined the U.S. position with greater
detail and clarity.
   Since lifting sanctions in 1986, the United States has been
cautiously encouraging economic recovery in Poland and has pledged
to support Warsaw's plea for assistance from international
financial institutions.
   Whitehead said the Polish program _ which includes wage and
price austerity _ would never be effective without popular support.
He said that must be achieved through consultations with workers,
notably the Solidarity free trade movement that is leading the
current strikes.
   ``We are urging the government to establish a dialogue with the
workers of Poland, including members of Solidarity'' to create an
``enthusiasm'' for the program, he said.
   ``We believe until that happens that the economic program of the
government, which strikes us as being a basically sensible program,
will not be able to become effective,'' he said. As a result, ``the
ability of the United States to support that program will be
ruined.''
   He said the United States had been planning to back Poland's
applications for loans from the World Bank and to work with the
so-called ``Paris Club'' of lender nations to restructure Poland's
massive foreign debt.
   There also is a possibility of direct U.S. assistance, Whitehead
said.
   ``But all of those things are now in jeopardy because of the
lack of a kind of national reconciliation,'' Whitehead said.
   Asked why Poland acted so strenuously against the strikers,
knowing the United States would react strongly, Whitehead said
``the Polish government evidently feels that it can impose an
economic program on the country without any kind of participation
of the people in developing the program.
   ``We have felt all along it is not possible to do it that way
and now the evidence begins to appear that it is not possible,'' he
said.
   Whitehead's visit to Poland last year was the highest-ranking
State Department mission to that country since the martial law
crackdown against Solidarity in 1981, and he has been to other
Eastern European countries as the Reagan administration official
with special responsibility for relations with the Soviet bloc
nations.
   During his visits, he has told leaders that improved performance
on human rights and moves toward freer economic life will lead to
the closer commercial ties they have been seeking with the United
States.
   Whitehead is scheduled on Monday to begin a 12-day trip to
Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and France.
   In Algeria, he said, he would seek more information from the
government on its role in the ending of last month's Kuwaiti Air
Lines hijacking. The plane, captured by gunmen seeking the release
of Shiite Moslems imprisoned on terrorism charges in Kuwait, ended
up in Algiers, where authorities talked the hijackers into freeing
the passengers.
   There have been unconfirmed published reports that the hijackers
are still in Algeria but Whitehead said ``we don't know for sure.''
   He repeated U.S. pleas to Algeria _ and any other country where
the hijackers might be _ to arrest them.
   ``We will set forth our views strongly, that hijackers should
not be allowed to get away with their criminal acts and must be
brought to justice,'' Whitehead said.

<HEAD>Pan Am 737 Makes Precautionary Landing Because of Smoke</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Pan American Boeing 737 airliner
made a precautionary landing at Long Beach Airport on Saturday
because smoke entered the cabin shortly after it took off from Los
Angeles International Airport, officials said.
   Flight 280 to San Diego, with 34 passengers and crew aboard,
landed safely at 7:38 a.m., said Alan Loflin, a Pan Am spokesman in
Dallas.
   There were no injuries and no damage to the plane, Loflin said.
   A small amount of smoke in the cabin was determined to come from
the ventilation system and was likely caused by some detergent that
may have gotten into a fan motor when the plane was cleaned Friday,
Loflin said.
   ``There was a presence of smoke in the cabin. It was definitely
not a smoke-filled cabin,'' Loflin said.
   The plane was scheduled to resume its flight to San Diego, he
said.
   A Federal Aviation Administration duty officer described the
landing as precautionary rather than an emergency. Loflin said
there was no emergency evacuation of the jet.
   Long Beach Airport is about 15 miles southeast of Los Angeles
International.

<HEAD>Men of the Cloth Celebrate Despite Zoning Threat To Savile Row</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tailors of Savile Row, Britain's world-famous
custom tailoring district, took to the street with their needles,
thread and scissors Saturday for a fitting centennial celebration.
   To kick off events marking the Federation of Merchant Tailors'
100th anniversary, a team of 20 cutters, tailors and finishers
assembled a gray striped woolen suit in just nine hours.
   The cornerstone of a gentleman's wardrobe normally would take
eight weeks to complete, require one or two fittings, and cost
$1,400 to $2,250, said federation president Robert Bright.
   ``I'm taking the opportunity of the centenary to remove the
metaphoric frosted windows and curtained windows that were a
feature of tailor shops for far too long,'' said Bright, also
chairman of the 159-year-old Wells of Mayfair firm.
   Savile Row, a short, narrow street in central London, was sealed
off to traffic and tents were erected where passers-by could watch
the 90 separate steps involved in fashioning a three-piece suit.
   The marathon pinning, basting and sewing session began at 9 a.m.
with the cutting of the fabric, and the last button was in place by
6:12 p.m.
   Martyn Lewis, a British Broadcasting Corp. TV anchorman with a
34-inch waist and 41-inch chest, was the guinea pig. He requested
only that the garment be made ``for sitting down in'' so he could
read the news without any inelegant wrinkling of the lapel of his
``bespoke'' suit _ a term derived from customers ``bespeaking''
their individual requirements.
   ``One of the aspects of a bespoke suit is that it is only right
for the person for whom it's made,'' Bright said, adding that Lewis
was getting the suit for free. ``The whole styling and the cutting
needs to embrace his personality and coloring as well as his
figuration.''
   Savile Row has been synonymous with conservative men's fashions
since the mid-1800s, when Henry Poole and Co. opened its back door
onto the street.
   Other tailors followed and the influx of tradesmen so upset
wealthy doctors living in the fashionable residential neighborhood
that they fled to Harley Street.
   Now, Savile Row is threatened by new planning laws, Bright said.
   Until last summer, light industry and offices were separate
planning categories, and permission was required to change from one
to the other. Both now fall into a new general business category.
   The government said it was trying to revitalize inner cities by
loosening planning laws. But Bright said that means tailors'
workshops in Savile Row and adjoining Soho can be redeveloped into
more lucrative office space without official permission.
   He expects rents to quadruple, followed by tax increases. Some
landlords already are asking about $95 a square foot, he said.
   ``It is an enormous threat. There is no way the French would
just pass up their haute couture industry, and yet this government
is quite prepared to write off the top of the British clothing
industry as if it didn't matter.''
   Bright said it's difficult to find words to describe the
pleasures of bespoke tailoring.
   ``It's an experience. It is a feeling of confidence that you
know that you are projecting just the image that you want to
project, the part of your personality that you want to speak ... We
are, in fact, creating a portrait in cloth,'' he said.
   With a ready-made suit ``you have to conform not only to a given
set of measures, but also to what the designer wants you to look
like when he hasn't even seen you,'' Bright said.
   A bespoke suit should last a decade, providing it hangs in the
closet for six days between wearings so the wool can recover its
bounce; hence, the advice that a proper English gentleman owns
seven suits, one for each day of the week.
   Bright said Savile Row does $48 million annual business,
including $32 million overseas.
   Anderson and Sheppard are known as the royal tailors, although
several windows on the row prominently display royal warrants,
proving they do business with Buckingham Palace.
   Poole's received it first royal warrant from Napoleon, and later
outfitted Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie.
   Huntsman and Sons, which keeps saddles in each of its five
fitting rooms, made riding breeches for King Edward VIII, who
abdicated to marry the American, Wallis Simpson.

   A monument of old cars set upright in the
ground to resemble Great Britain's Stonehenge can stay so long as
it's insured and vandals don't turn the area into a junkyard, the
City Council said.
   ``Carhenge'' creator James Reinders, formerly of Alliance, now
of Houston, built the monument last June on land he owns north of
here. It consists of cars set in the ground and other cars welded
across the top.
   The council approved the permit request on a 4-0 vote Thursday
with four stipulations.
   Reinders must obtain $100,000 worth of liability insurance, get
the necessary permits from the Nebraska Department of Roads to
construct an apron off the highway, build a parking lot and provide
a performance bond to ensure Carhenge is kept up.
   City Manager Wolfgang Bauer said state officials agree that if
the vehicles are vandalized, Carhenge would become a junkyard.
   Mayor Rich Robb said some rural people have had nothing positive
to say about Carhenge.

   The idea of plunking down money for the
privilege of quaffing some ritzy, imported bubbly stuff _ water,
that is _ apparently doesn't go over as well in Georgia as it does
in California.
   Owners of a ``water bar'' restaurant decided to close down after
demand for their non-alcoholic, health-related beverages dried up.
   Club Soda opened in this Atlanta suburb in October as an
alternative to Atlanta's innumerable bars and nightclubs. In
addition to a regular menu and alcoholic drinks, it offered as many
as 75 kinds of water and seltzer for up to $6 for a large bottle of
the deluxe stuff.
   But it didn't catch on, said owner Jim Killeen, despite the
success of similar establishments in California.
   ``We felt it was strong enough to warrant investing a
half-million dollars into the concept,'' Killeen said. ``But it
never materialized. People just weren't interested in coming into
that type of establishment for health-related beverages.''

   Top students at West Brunswick High
School can parlay their potential into bonuses including free
lunches, bumper stickers, sunglasses and preferred seating at
athletic events.
   ``It encourages perhaps-borderline students to do better,''
Spanish teacher Nancy Turner said. ``I've heard kids say they are
one point away, and they want to make it.''
   The new rewards program, modeled after a 4-year-old program in
Conway, S.C., has created excitement about achievement, she said.
   At the end of each six-week grading period, the program doles
out gold cards to students who earn all A's. Green cards go to
students who receive all A's and B's.
   Card-holders qualify for certain privileges _ preferred seating
at home athletic events and close-in parking spaces, time off for
independent study _ and various material items.
   ``Last year, we didn't get anything,'' said Brent Tyndall.
``This makes you want to maintain your grades because each six
weeks you get something every day.''
   An alternate opinion was voiced by Martin Bolick.
   ``I don't see myself busting my tail for a T-shirt,'' he said.
   But some who earned C's said the program had inspired them to
work harder.
   ``I miss it every week by one point,'' said Veronica Jenrette.
``I think it is a good idea, though. It gives them recognition.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Facing Internal Problems As Peace Talks Drag On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government faces
increasing economic and social pressures as talks drag on to work
out a lasting peace in its almost 7-year-old war with U.S.-backed
rebels.
   Cease-fire talks under a March 23 agreement with the Contra
rebels remained snagged on security issues with deep mistrust on
both sides. A fragile temporary truce was generally holding, but
the future remained uncertain.
   Seven weeks after historic meetings in the border town of Sapoa
brought an unexpected hope of peace, deep differences still divide
the two sides. Two more rounds of talks in Managua have left them
without even an agreement on where and when to continue
negotiations.
   Meanwhile, internal problems grew for the leftist government
last week with a hunger strike by more than 30 workers demanding
higher wages. The workers ended their 10-day fast in Managua after
the government agreed to begin salary negotiations on Monday, union
leaders said.
   The construction workers and car mechanics held their hunger
strike at the Socialist General Workers Federation headquarters.
While they were holed up inside, Sandinista special forces police
broke up demonstrations outside with rubber truncheons and detained
more than 70 supporters.
   The Sandinistas also barred civilian movement around the union
hall, detained Nicaraguans without charge, and suspended several
radio news shows accused of broadcasting false information about
the strike.
   It was the most blatant show of government repression since a
regional peace plan was signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras. The
plan to end fighting in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala also
called for democratic reforms.
   The government's handling of the hunger strike stood in sharp
contrast to its openly conciliatory statements toward the Contras
and prompted criticism from both rightists and far leftists.
   ``Talk with the workers, not with Contras,'' said a poster from
the Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement.
   Erick Ramirez, president of the Social Christian Party, charged
the government with restricting liberties without using the laws.
   The hunger strikers joined workers, claiming to number 4,500,
who walked off their jobs Feb. 25 to demand more pay and protest
economic measures enacted Feb. 15.
   The steps, designed to end the black market and cut inflation,
included issuing a new currency and setting new wage scales and
price structures. Inflation is officially placed at an annual rate
of 1,800 percent, unofficially at 7,000 percent.
   The Sandinistas say the war with the rebels has caused more than
$3 billion in damage.
   Prices set by the government in February jumped in the open
markets because state-run supermarket shelves were bare as usual.
   Black marketeers also returned. The official rate of the cordoba
is 11 for $1, yet the illegal market puts the exchange at 85 to $1.
   According to the Sandinistas, the price of a pound of rice is 4
cordobas, but it sells for 25. Cooking oil, scarce for years, sells
for 100 cordobas instead of the government-mandated 12.
   The Soviet bloc continues to help with more than $500 million in
economic aid yearly. The total of East bloc military aid is a state
secret.
   The United States cut off all aid to Nicaragua in 1981.
President Reagan recently renewed U.S. trade sanctions in effect
since 1985.
   The U.S. Embassy said: ``The effect of the sanctions has been to
increase Nicaragua's costs of trade, although alternative markets
have been found for everything the country can produce and many
U.S.-made goods are still obtainable at higher prices.''
   To further bolster the crippled economy, the government began
cutbacks that will eliminate 20,000 state jobs, mostly among lower
level staunch Sandinista supporters.
   ``The economic difficulties are of such a magnitude that we
don't have any alternative,'' Interior Minister Tomas Borge said
recently. ``We have to put these people into the production
sector.''
   Thousands of rural peasants who would otherwise be sowing crops
have fled to the capital, where a third of the country's population
of 3 million lives, to escape fighting.
   The battles started in November 1981, less than a 1{ years after
the Sandinistas came to power in a revolutionary war that overthrew
the distatorship of late President Anastasio Somoza.
   ``The general mood is the government doesn't know what to do and
the economic situation doesn't have any way out until there is
peace and a new, acceptable government,'' said Ramiro Gurdian, vice
president of the anti-government Private Enterprise Council.
   The 60-day cease-fire signed in Sapoa and begun April 1 had
largely held until this past week, when two violations were
reported.
   Sandinista army troops said rebels attacked government soldiers
140 miles southeast of Managua on Thursday, wounding four. The
Defense Ministry also said Contras based at a Honduran naval base
in the Gulf of Fonseca used speedboats to raid a government
military position on Wednesday.
   A commander for the Indian rebel group Yatama, in the Caribbean
coast region, said government troops recently attacked rebel
positions 270 miles northeast of Managua.

<HEAD>Flag Paintings Show Opens at National Gallery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare exhibition of American impressionist
painter Childe Hassam's flag pictures explodes into view Sunday at
the National Gallery of Art with all the brilliant optimism of a
Fourth of July fireworks display.
   It is the first time since 1922, before the artist's death, that
his patriotic canvases from World War I have been drawn from widely
scattered public museums and private collections and shown
together. The lenders include IBM, Frank Sinatra and the White
House.
   Hassam, the most important American impressionist at the turn of
the century, was enthralled by the majesty and symbolic power of
the U.S. and Allied flags, banners and bunting that festooned New
York City streets _ mostly along Fifth Avenue _ for wartime parades
and fund-raising rallies.
   His 31 flag pictures, painted from 1916 until the war ended in
1919, are ``pre-eminent examples of how art could serve
patriotism,'' says Ilene Susan Fort, associate curator of American
art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art which organized the
exhibition.
   Hassam's flags frequently are framed by Manhattan churches and
skyscrapers as symbols of the moral force of the Allied cause and
America's emergence as a world power, she said.
   The National Gallery exhibition includes 23 of the flag
paintings, which were sold individually after 1922 after failure of
a plan to purchase a group of them as a war memorial for New York
City.
   Ms. Fort said five of the flag paintings sold in the 1920s,
including three depicting women watching parades from flag-draped
windows, have since vanished and their whereabouts _ if they still
exist _ are unknown. She said she hoped that word of the exhibition
might encourage the owners to step forward.
   When the show closes at the National Gallery on July 18, it will
travel to the Los Angeles museum, Aug. 21 through Oct. 30, the Amon
Carter Museum at Fort Worth, Texas, Jan. 7 through March 12, and
the New York Historical Society, April 20 through June 25.
   The National Gallery show is the second in a three-part series
devoted to American impressionist artists and underwritten by Bell
Atlantic. The first was an exhibition of paintings by William
Merritt Chase last year. The series will end in the fall of 1989
with the works of John Twachtman.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JACK WILLIAMS IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neither
side blinked when U.S. and Iranian ships glided silently past each
other Saturday in their closest encounter since a naval battle
three weeks ago.
   The 3,700-ton guided missile frigate Jack Williams spotted the
Booshehr, a 354-foot Iranian supply boat on early morning patrol,
after the Williams crossed the tense strait of Hormuz twice in less
than 24 hours.
   The two ships sailed within about 2,500 yards of each other on
opposite courses in the rolling blue seas about 20 miles east of
Abu Musa, a heavily fortified island where Iran maintains a gunboat
base and air field.
   The ships passed without any radio or other routine
acknowledgement in an area almost within range of Iran's land-based
Chinese-made Silkworm missiles. The U.S. Navy calls the area ``The
Silkworm Envelope,'' but the crew uses the nickname ``The
Wormhole.''
   ``They are probably on patrol, like us, tracking ship movement,
gathering information,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke.
   The Booshehr's presence attracted curious crewmembers and their
cameras.
   A mine-spotting crewman stood at the bow of the Iranian boat, a
sign of an apparent split between the regular Iranian navy and the
country's Revolutionary Guards, who seem to lay mines with autonomy.
   ``That's nice,'' a lookout on the Williams told reporters when
he saw his counterpart on the drab gray Iranian ship. ``Even they
don't know where the mines are.''
   American officers said the Booshehr is one of only a few
sightings of Iranian warships that have crept out of port since the
April 18 fighting.
   The Williams was at the center of those clashes, which took
place near where the ships passed Saturday. The U.S. Navy said
after the April 18 clashes that it sank an Iranian frigate,
disabled a second, and hit four other ships _ a major loss for
Iran's small navy.
   A calm has settled over the Persian Gulf since then, despite
Iranian threats of retaliation.
   ``It's nice to see their entire navy passing,'' joked a chief
petty officer on the bridge.
   However, Iran still has its fleet of gunboats and other vessels,
as well as the ability to lay mines, and the U.S. Navy has tried to
remain vigilant.
   Before meeting the Iranian boat, the Williams had completed
escorting two tankers through the strait and into the Gulf of Oman.
A British destroyer, HMS Gloucester, rode shotgun for four tankers
in the same convoy.
   ``It was as though Iran did not exist,'' Cmdr. Edward Mann,
captain of the Williams, said of the quiet trip.

   Hundreds of people lined the streets
of this Glasgow suburb Saturday to pay tribute to one of three
British airmen killed in IRA attacks in the Netherlands.
   A cortege bearing the coffin of Senior Aircraftman John Baxter,
21, wound its way to a cemetery beside Cardonald's chapel for the
burial. A 12-man Royal Air Force squad fired a volley of shots, and
a bugler sounded ``Taps'' as the coffin was lowered into a grave.
   At a Mass earlier, the Most Rev. Thomas Winning, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Glasgow, denounced the killing and said
people ``shudder with revulsion at the thought of this terrible
deed.
   ``We deplore and condemn it with the whole of our being. No
cause, no matter how just, can ever claim the right to achieve its
ends by these means,'' he said.
   The bodies of Baxter and two other airmen killed in the May 7
attacks, Senior Aircraftmen John Miller Reid, 21, and Ian Shinner,
20, were flown home Friday.
   Reid, also of Glasgow, was cremated Saturday after a private
service in nearby Lenzie. Shinner was to be buried Monday in his
hometown, Winsford, England.
   Baxter and Reid were killed when a bomb detonated in their car
outside a discotheque in the Dutch village of Nieuw Bergen.
   Shinner died an hour earlier in a hail of bullets as he and two
other airmen sat in a car in Roermond, about 35 miles from Nieuw
Bergen.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the
attacks. The outlawed group is fighting to oust the British from
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Fan Says Late Mayor Took Care of Pittsburgh</HEAD>

   The late Richard S. Caliguiri was known as a
mayor who cared for people more than politics during his 11 years
in office, and fans said Saturday that's the way people will
remember the popular Democrat.
   ``He took care of Pittsburgh just like it was his family,'' said
bartender Donald Jones, 36. ``That's what they need in all
government, somebody like him.''
   ``You could be the lowest person, but he still spoke to you,
he'd see you and wave,'' Jones said as he wiped counters at The
Oyster House, a century-old downtown restaurant and tavern.
   Caliguiri died Friday at the age of 56 of heart failure
triggered by amyloidosis, a rare disorder in which protein deposits
build up in the heart and other major organs. The deposits
stiffened his heart muscle.
   Dave Welty, Caliguiri's press secretary, said the mayor made
friends everywhere.
   ``He's sort of been a mayor for the people and of the people,''
Welty said. ``He did not seclude himself. Dick genuinely liked
people.''
   ``He wasn't just out in a political year when he was out looking
for votes. Dick was out all the time, so the people knew him.''
   Theresa Fuchs, 63, of Pittsburgh, said she saw Caliguiri at many
parades and events.
   ``He was really a human being,'' she said. ``He never looked
down on anybody.''
   Caliguiri was credited with helping shift Pittsburgh away from
its dependence on the steel industry to make it a progressive city
of 365,000 people. The turnaround earned Pittsburgh national
recognition.
   Church bells rang simultaneously across the city Friday evening
and flags flew at half-staff on state property in Pennsylvania.
   The Pittsburgh Pirates announced players will have Caliguiri's
initials sewn on the right sleeve of their uniforms for the rest of
the season. The mayor led a drive in 1985 to keep the baseball team
in Pittsburgh.
   City employees draped black bunting and placed black wreaths
around entrances to the City County Building, which houses the
mayor's office.
   City Council President Sophie Masloff, 70, was sworn in as mayor
Friday morning. She ordered city offices closed Monday, when the
mayor's body will be moved to the City County Building. Schools,
museums and the city's zoo also will be closed.
   Mrs. Masloff is the city's first woman and first Jewish mayor.
Under the city charter, she will serve the remainder of Caliguiri's
term, which expires Dec. 31, 1989.
   As council president in 1977, Caliguiri was tapped to be interim
mayor when incumbent Pete Flaherty joined the Carter adminstration.
He ran for mayor in November 1977, as an independent, and beat a
popular Democrat.
   He was twice re-elected by landslide margins during a rocky
period in which the region lost more than 75,000 jobs, suffered the
departure of Gulf Corp. in 1984 and experienced unemployment rates
as high as 19 percent in 1982.
   A Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated Tuesday morning at
St. Paul's Cathedral.

<HEAD>Sources Spell Out Details Behind Hostage Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French found a way to win the release of their
last three hostages in Lebanon while denying with clear consciences
they paid ransom, according to Iranian and French sources.
   French commentators have shied away from the subject in the
jubilant homecoming of Jean-Paul Kauffmann, Marcel Carton and
Marcel Fontaine, the last of 10 hostages welcomed by Premier
Jacques Chirac in two years.
   Authorities have refused to discuss negotiations and, if history
is a guide, they never will. Chirac, facing presidential elections
Sunday, denies there was a deal.
   But sources with no stake in the negotiations describe the
following accord with Iran, which then pressured the Hezbollah and
its terrorist wing, Islamic Jihad, to free the hostages:
   _ France agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Iran, vital
because of Tehran's growing isolation, falling oil receipts,
setbacks in the war with Iraq and losses to the United States in
the Persian Gulf.
   _ France paid $400 million, the last segment of a billion-dollar
dispute over a nuclear-energy project. Iran still demands $1
billion in interest. ``That is for next time,'' one Iranian source
said, only half in jest.
   _ Two terrorist groups in Lebanon received $10 million from a
mysterious Iranian businessman, likely to win lucrative favors from
both countries.
   _ France will reconsider the case of Anis Naccache, in prison
for trying to assassinate former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar
of Iran, but he is not likely to be freed immediately.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, included
Iranian emigres, Western diplomats and French officials.
   France's sudden release last month of suspected terrorist
Mohammed Mohajer also was involved in the deal, Iranian sources
said, adding that Mohajer is related to Sheik Ibrahim Amin,
Hezbollah's official spokesman.
   After the hostages returned home, an Iranian journalist said a
switchboard operator had begun answering, ``embassy,'' instead of
``interest section,'' at Iran's Paris headquarters.
   Algeria apparently guaranteed the arrangement in the name of
friendship with France and Islamic solidarity. France made no
commitment to cut back its arms sales to Iraq, to sell more to
Iran, or to alter its Middle East policy.
   The release was planned for just after April 25, the first round
of presidential elections, but was delayed when Syria tried to gain
partial credit, Iranian sources said.
   Amir Taheri, former editor of the influential daily Khayyan in
Iran and now a political analyst, agreed with the sources' version.
He said the deal clearly would encourage more terrorism.
   ``We have reached a point where the taking of hostages is an
accepted international practice,'' he said. ``Iran sees it that
way, and so do others. It is a sad fact, but it is true.''
   The negotiations brought muted scorn in Washington, where the
Reagan administration has been shaken by revelations of its own
secret deal with Iran. In Britain, however, outrage was vehement.
   Under a headline reading, ``Shame of the Craven French,'' the
daily Sun wrote:
   ``We have always warned that you can't trust the French. They
care only for themselves. But even by French standards of
chicanery, the deal ... has a nasty odor about it ... Unlike the
French, we do not crawl at the feet of scum.''
   Contempt was heightened by the sudden appearance in Paris of
Dominique Prieur, remanded on trust by New Zealand after she was
convicted of helping blow up the Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior,
in which one person died.
   Chirac ended her confinement on a South Pacific island, two days
before the election, because she was pregnant and her father was
ill. Her husband, an army captain, had been assigned to be with her.
   Adding that to the hostage deal, London's Telegraph observed:
   ``The French government seems determined to plumb the depths of
dishonor ... This is the country that calls us Perfidious Albion:
That's unmitigated Gaul for you.''
   French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua retorted:
   ``We have not ceded to any claim. We have not accorded any funds
of any sort to anyone, not a franc, not a dollar, not a
deutschmark, not a yen.''
   The final arrangements were made by Ayatollah Janati Kermani and
Jean-Charles Marchiani, Pasqua's special envoy who confounded
eavesdroppers by talking to Paris in Corsican patois. French
sources said Marchiani had direct contacts with representatives of
Hezbollah.
   The trickiest part apparently was paying off what is now called
a loan in the Eurodif project, a consortium of France, West
Germany, Spain and Gabon to produce enriched African uranium for
nuclear power plants.
   Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi of Iran joined Eurodif in 1975,
investing $1 billion for 11.75 percent of the shares and access to
uranium from a plant in southern France.
   After its revolution in 1979, Iran renounced the deal and wanted
its money back. France, arguing that the money was in shares, said
the capital had to be sold.
   As a gesture to Iran in 1986, Chirac paid back a third after
French negotiators agreed to convert Iran's particiption into a
loan. He paid another third in November as part of a previous
hostage deal.
   The latest payment clears the original amount. But in a legal
battle that has already reached 50,000 pages of documents, Iran
wants back interest because France has called the money a loan.
   Relations were broken in precipitous events leading up to the
last hostage release.
   Iranian Embassy officials in Paris refused to let French
authorities question Wahid Gordji, an embassy official suspected of
involvement with terrorism. Police surrounded the embassy.
   In turn, Iranian troops sealed off the French Embassy in Tehran.
France said Iran had effectively severed relations.
   Four months later, both sieges were lifted. Gordji was allowed
to slip out of France, unquestioned. The Eurodif money was paid.
And French hostages Roger Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin came home.

   An Arab-American leader of the Palestinian
uprising has launched a hunger strike to protest an order banning
him from Israel, and Arab leaders in a new leaflet Saturday urged
more protests.
   Nine Arabs were injured Saturday by beatings and rubber bullets
in sporadic clashes with Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   The army said it had no reports about beatings but that it was
checking reports about the clashes.
   On Friday, the government ordered 44-year-old Mubarak Awad
deported, alleging he had done much to incite the five-month
uprising in the occupied territories.
   So far, 184 Palestinians and two Israelis have died in the
violence that began Dec. 8, according to U.N. figures.
   Awad protested the order and announced Saturday that he had been
on hunger strike since he was jailed Thursday night and that he
planned to continue the action ``until the (deportation) order is
rescinded,'' said his wife, Nancy Nye.
   Ms. Nye also told The Associated Press that prison officials
took away her husband's mattress and blanket Saturday ``as
punishment for refusing to eat.''
   The Jerusalem-born Awad, who also has a home in Wapakoneta,
Ohio, has urged civil disobedience against Israeli rule as head of
the Jerusalem-based Center for Non-Violent Studies.
   Some of the methods he has advocated such as sit-ins, commercial
strikes and a boycott of Israeli goods, have been adopted by PLO
underground leaders of the uprising.
   The United States urged Israel on Friday to reconsider the
deportation.
   Many West Bank Arabs also have stopped paying some of their
taxes. Israel television reported Saturday that the government
warned Arab leaders it would cut off water and electricity to 10
West Bank villages unless residents paid what they owed.
   Meanwhile, the religious underground movement, ``Hamas,'' an
Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, issued a
page-long leaflet calling for more anti-Israel protests.
   Referring to Israel the leaflet said ``the Zionist entity and
collaborators and enemies of the nation try to silence the voice of
the intefadeh (Arabic for uprising).''
   ``We will continue our blessed intefadeh with all our strength
and determination ... Forward on the road of dignity and victory,
more sacrifices, more attacks on the enemy, the enemy of the
nation.''
   The leaflet was printed Friday and distributed at morning
prayers Saturday. It urged Palestinians to step up anti-Israeli
protests during the last 10 days of the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan, which is marked by daytime fasts and feasts at night.
   The leaflet also urged special prayers and observance in memory
of Palestinians killed in the rebellion.
   Israel has heightened pressure to break the rebellion in the
last week by detaining Arab journalists and ordering shops
throughout the West Bank shut for three days until Sunday.
   The latest Israeli move came Friday when the government ordered
Awad deported.
   Also Saturday, soldiers fired rubber bullets at protesters who
blocked a main road with boulders in Anabta in the West Bank, said
an Arab reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hospital officials said a 25-year-old woman was treated after
being hit by four rubber bullets.
   Eight Arabs, including three women, were also treated at Shifa
Hospital in Gaza City for bruises and lacerations after being
beaten by soldiers during disturbances at the Beach refugee camp
and in Gaza, said hospital director Dr. Ahmed Yassih.
   The army said it had no reports about beatings or any violent
incidents in Gaza.

<HEAD>Report Says Race, Sex Discrimination Pervasive At Waste Control
Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Racial and sexual harassment and
discrimination have been pervasive at the agency which handles most
of the waste treatment in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the state
Human Rights Department says.
   ``The extent of it was large,'' Human Rights Commissioner
Stephen Cooper said Friday when the report about the Metropolitan
Waste Control Commission was released.
   ``There was a very lax effort to do anything about known
problems,'' Cooper added.
   Women and minority workers faced hostile work environments and,
at times, have been subject to different discipline than white male
workers, the report said.
   The waste control commission, which has an annual budget of $108
million, operates waste treatment plants that process 80 percent of
the sewage in the metropolitan area. It has about 980 employees,
and recent figures showed there were more than 140 women and almost
100 minority group members.
   Commission officials said Friday they will work with the Human
Rights Department in making changes recommended in the report. They
are to meet with Cooper May 16 to discuss the recommendations.
   ``We can't control how people think, but we can say what is not
tolerated,'' said Peter Meintsma, commission chairman. ``The
Metropolitan Waste Control Commission does and will continue to
provide a fair and equitable work place.''
   Meintsma said anyone who discriminates or harasses faces
dismissal. He said he did not expect major turnovers while the
recommendations are carried out.
   Human Rights Department recommendations have the authority of
law. If the commission rejects them, the department can sue the
commission.
   Investigators found that racial discrimination sometimes
included remarks or acts condoned by supervisors. Until recently,
the report said, employees have been unclear about what sex
discrimination is.
   The report said the commission's disability-leave policy also is
discriminatory. In addition, the agency does not have an
affirmative action staff to investigate discrimination complaints,
the report said.
   The commission needs to set up training on racial and sexual
harassment, as well as disciplinary measures, the report said.
   Meintsma said the commission already has enacted some of the
recommendations. Sexual harassment training will be finished for
all employees by the end of June, and training on racial
discrimination will follow, he said.
   The commission also is forming a 15-member affirmative action
committee and a staff member is examining the affirmative action
office.
   However, a black former employee said he doubts the commission's
commitment to change.
   ``People cause this problem and problem people cannot be
expected to straighten this out,'' said Makolle Williams, a former
machinist at the commission who has filed suit against the
commission alleging racial discrimination and harassment.

<HEAD>Grocers Use Bags Promoting Health Care For Pregnant Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Illinois shoppers are getting a
new message at the checkout counter: Pregnant women need medical
attention before their babies are born.
   The message, distributed in conjunction with Mother's Day, is
printed on shopping bags and is designed to reduce infant mortality.
   Illinois' infant death rate has been above the national average
for 22 consecutive years.
   Independent grocers throughout the state and some big chains
have agreed to use the bags, said U.S. Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
They began appearing Friday, and soon up to 600 grocers will be
helping to pass the message along, Durbin said.
   The message, under a headline ``A healthy mother means a healthy
baby,'' tells women that a ``baby's life depends on early health
care'' and provides a toll-free number at the Illinois Department
of Public Health.
   The state's public health chief, Dr. Bernard J. Turnock, said
his agency would provide information for pregnant woman who have no
insurance, cannot afford a doctor or have other questions or
problems.
   He said women calling the hotline can be referred to local
agencies and may be eligible for financial help.
   Durbin said he thought of the grocery bag idea after similar
campaigns were used to help search for missing children. He posed
the idea to lobbyists representing grocery stores, and they agreed.
   ``I have young kids myself. It's a good way of communicating,''
Mark Niederkorn, manager of Kennedy's Market in Decatur, said
Saturday.
   Turnock said infant mortality is one of the major problems
facing the state, particularly in central and southern Illinois.
   Illinois ranks among the top 10 states in infant death rates and
is the worst among northern industrial states.
   Last year, more than 2,000 Illinois babies died before reaching
their first birthday. The infant mortality rate equalled 11.5
deaths per 1,000 live births.
   Turnock said poverty in cities and the decreasing numbers of
hospitals and doctors who provide obstetric care in rural areas are
two of the biggest reasons for infant mortality.
   Durbin, a member of the House Select Committee on Children,
represents the 20th Congressional District, which stretches from
central Illinois west to the Mississippi River.
   His goal is to circulate 5 million of the bags each week, but
about 180,000 a week are being circulated for starters, he said.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev went before top
journalists and artists on Saturday and asked them to back his
program of reforms, Tass said.
   Also on Saturday, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda called on
representatives who will attend an important party conference next
month to blunt those conservatives who doubt Gorbachev's reforms.
   Tass said Gorbachev addressed a meeting in the Communist Party
Central Committee of editors of top state-run newspapers and
literary journals, and heads of artistic unions.
   He called on editors and artists to ``all the more energetically
help in the renewal of all sides of our life,'' said the brief Tass
report. It said a full report on the meeting would be published
later.
   Pravda's front-page article contained more criticism of a March
13 article in another organ of the official press that questioned
whether Gorbachev's reforms had gone too far. That article has
caused an ideological controversy in the Soviet press.
   Soviet officials rarely given any definitive word about
ideological disputes in the party hierarchy, but clues often appear
in newspaper articles.
   Unconfirmed reports in Moscow have said the article that started
the dispute _ a letter by Leningrad teacher Nina Andreyeva praising
dictator Josef V. Stalin's role in Soviet history _ had the backing
of Kremlin No. 2 man Yegor K. Ligachev, and led to a showdown
between him and Gorbachev.
   Ligachev, who is responsible for the party's ideology, has
struck a more conservative note than Gorbachev, especially on the
Soviet party chief's call for ``glasnost,'' or greater openness in
discussing social issues.
   Tass said Ligachev attended the meeting in the Central
Committee, as would be expected of the party's chief ideologist.
   At several such meetings in recent months, Gorbachev has sought
to define the limits of what is permissible in the Soviet press
under his more open policies.
   Delegates to the party conference scheduled for late June ``will
not only have to defend the revolutionary way of thinking and
acting, but should the need arise, give a courageous rebuff to
conservative aspirations,'' Pravda said.
   ``A lot will depend on their firm and principled stand. Most
important _ the destiny of perestroika will depend on it,'' Pravda
said. ``Perestroika'' is the term Gorbachev uses for his economic
and social reforms.
   The party conference gives Gorbachev a chance in between
congresses held every five years to change the makeup of the
policy-making Central Committee, thereby strengthening his support
in the top levels of the Communist Party.
   The conference could be a major test of Gorbachev's strength and
determine how forcefully he can pursue reform.
   Two days after Pravda printed its original response attacking
the Andreyeva letter on April 4, Sovietskaya Rossiya was forced to
recant by publishing the Pravda article in full without commentary.
Pravda said in April that Ms. Andreyeva's letter should not have
been printed.
   But the debate in the press has not died out. In the past week,
three papers have defend the right of Gorbachev's opponents to
speak out even if the party judges them to be wrong.
   Pravda said Saturday that Gorbachev's opponents had been
underestimated, but that they betrayed their true values through
Ms. Andreyeva's letter.
   The newspaper also tried to tie opponents of Gorbachev's reforms
to the ethnic disputes in the southern Soviet republics of
Azerbaijan and Armenia, where at least 32 people died in late
February and early March.
   It said that party members were among the officials who either
shirked their responsibilties or were afraid to act to stop rioting
in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. Such people must be ready to
take initiative, and if they cannot, must step aside for leaders
who will, Pravda said.

<HEAD>Another Oscar Goes Up For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Take heart Robin Williams, William Hurt,
Holly Hunter and other Academy Award runners-up losers. There seem
to be plenty of Oscars available _ for a price.
   Hollywood memorabilia dealer Malcolm Willits, who earlier this
year sold the 1951 best picture Oscar for a reported price of more
than $15,000, says he has another one to put on the block.
   The 1951 Oscar was awarded to MGM for ``An American In Paris.''
Willits won't say what this other one was for, however, only that
it was presented for best something or other in 1961.
   ``I just don't want to embarrass anybody,'' Willits said Friday.
``The original recipient was down on his luck.''
   He said he acquired it from a Santa Monica pawnbroker who
accepted it as collateral on a $300 loan.
   Willits' publicist, Chris Harris, said he expects the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to be unhappy about the latest
sale plans. The Academy has told Willits it has the right of first
refusal on old Oscars and that selling them is illegal, he said.
   Messages left with the Academy's answering service Saturday were
not immediately returned. The answering service said nobody from
the Academy would be available to comment until Monday.
   The best picture Oscar reportedly fell into the hands of a
writer after much of MGM's property was discarded when the studio
was bought by Cable News Network founder Ted Turner.
   Willits also handled the $13,000 sale of Marlon Brando's best
actor Oscar for the 1954 movie ``On the Waterfront.'' Brando had
reportedly given that one to a friend to use as a doorstop.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party newspaper on
Saturday dismissed claims from dissidents and U.S. officials that
authorities brutalized a human rights activist who died in prison.
   The daily Rude Pravo made its statement in its first report on
the April 26 death of Pavel Wonka, who was buried Friday.
   Wonka served 21 months on subversion charges before being
arrested again on April 5 and accused of violating ``protective
surveillance'' rules. On April 20, he was sentenced to five months
in jail, and he died six days later in prison at Hradec Kralove.
   Rude Pravo said an autopsy showed that Wonka, 35, died of
pulmonary embolism, a blockage of blood vessels.
   The newspaper added that despite the finding, the death was used
by ``Western anti-Communist centers'' as ``a pretext for an
attack'' on the communist state.
   Rude Pravo criticized what it said was an ``anti-Czechoslovak
statement'' by Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., who is deputy chairman
of the U.S. delegation to the Helsinki human rights conference in
Vienna.
   Hoyer said Wonka had suffered unjust sentencing and brutal
treatment in prison, and U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann made
similar charges.
   Rude Pravo on Saturday carried an interview with two U.S.
doctors who also examined Wonka's body. One of them, Robert
Lawrence of Harvard University, said he saw no evidence of
``significant torture.''
   Czechoslovak dissidents said earlier that Wonka was beaten in
prison. Petr Uhl, a member of the Charter 77 rights movement, said
Friday that Wonka was illegally convicted the second time because
he was ill and confined to a wheelchair.
   Wonka was buried in his hometown, Vrchlabi, in east Bohemia on
Friday. Dissident sources said police prevented at least two
people, prominent playwright Vaclav Havel and his wife, Olga, from
attending.
   The state news agency CTK, which carried excerpts of the Rude
Pravo article, on Saturday attacked Wonka's activities, charging
that he was ``very active against socialism in the last few
years.'' It said he wrote letters that ``offended Czechoslovak
public officials and the social system, made fabrications about
responsible officials and disseminated them without evidence, (and)
grossly attacked the Czechoslovak state and political bodies.''
   The report also said Wonka physically attacked a district court
judge in Jicin.

   Actor Robert Redford arrived in the Soviet Union
on Saturday for a 10-day tour to attend showings of his films and
meet film audiences in three cities, Tass said.
   Redford arrived in Leningrad, where the city's largest movie
theater was showing a selection of his films including ``All the
President's Men,'' ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' ``The
Natural,'' and his new work ``The Milagro Beanfield War.''
   Iosif Kheifitz, head of the Leningrad cinematographers
organization told the official Soviet news agency that Redford's
visit would ``give us an opportunity to develop the contacts we've
shaped'' by watching Redford's films.
   ``We follow with interest the creative work of this great master
who has been acting as a public figure ever more vigorously
lately,'' Kheifitz said.
   Redford will be in Moscow on Tuesday to open a festival of his
films in the Soviet capital. He also is to take part in a
conference on environmental issues. He travels to Tbilisi, the
capital of the Soviet republic of Georgia, on May 13.

<HEAD>Statehouse Construction Work Stumbles on Hancock Foundations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid piles of dirt dug up on the Statehouse lawn
during a renovation project, archaeologists say they may have found
traces of patriot John Hancock's home.
   The foundations of the granite mansion itself may be lost
forever beneath the remains of later buildings. But an
archaeological company hired by the state reports that a
5-foot-high granite garden wall remains intact.
   ``What we do have appears to be the back wall of the terrace
gardens growing up the hill,'' said Michael Roberts, a partner in
the Groton, Mass., firm Time Lines Inc.
   Roberts said he and fellow archaeologists plan to recommend
preserving the excavated site around the wall. The firm is due to
release a study of its findings later this month.
   Officials have halted work around the site while they study
whether a nearby foundation could also be from the Hancock mansion,
which was torn down in 1863. But Roberts said he thinks that the
foundation is part of a later building.
   ``Our analysis seems to indicate that the (Hancock) house
foundation itself was severly destroyed, disturbed and removed when
mansions in the 1860s were put in place on top of that property,''
he said.
   Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of Independence in
1776, lived in the Beacon Hill mansion most of his life. One of
Boston's wealthiest men and later governor of Massachusetts,
Hancock received many a dignitary at the home, including President
George Washington.
   The mansion, which had been built in 1733 for Hancock's uncle,
was torn down 130 years later after the state failed to appropriate
money to buy and preserve it. The site now lies in front of a later
west wing of the Statehouse.
   The state is spending $32 million on a renovation project in and
around the Statehouse, due to be completed this summer. Excavation
related to improvements in drainage on the grounds led to the
discovery of the Hancock wall, the top of which lay 2 feet below
ground.
   When excavators discovered the wall and a nearby foundation,
city archaeologist Stephen Pendery called for a work stoppage,
arguing that the foundation was likely the Hancock house. Like
Roberts, state officials contended that the foundation was the
remains of later townhouses, but they finally agreed to stop work.
   For the short term, Roberts said, ``the wall will be preserved
in place the way it is. It will be covered over, kept intact and
well documented.''
   Exposing the wall will require an excavation of some seven feet,
he said.
   Judging from descriptions of those who saw them, the house and
garden must have been splendid. One 19th century account at the
State Library tells of ``a vast entrance hall (that) divided the
mansion in the center and extended through to the rear where it
gave upon a group of the loveliest gardens in Boston, laid out on
the hillside against which the house nestled.''
   The wealthy merchant Thomas Hancock, the house's original owner
and John's uncle, insisted on the finest fruit trees, flowers and
shrubbery for the garden.
   When British soldiers occupied Boston during the Revolutionary
War, the home and ancillary buildings were a garrison and hospital
for British soldiers. Surprisingly, despite the hatred of the
Redcoats for John Hancock, the house was spared the destruction
wrought on other Boston homes.
   A letter from a Hancock relative tells of a backgammon table
that was missing and how Hancock insisted that the British replace
it.

   Swarms of locusts have been seen in
Saudi Arabia's agriculturally important northern regions but
officials said Saturday they were confident there would be no crop
damage.
   Farther south on the Arabian Peninsula, fears of a locust
invasion were dispelled after agriculture officials took a closer
look and found them to be grasshoppers.
   A. Mjeni, plant protection expert with the Omani government,
said there were no locust sightings in the sultanate so far and he
saw ``a minimal threat'' to the rest of the Arabian Peninsula.
   A path of locusts has been moving recently through parts of
North Africa, consuming large amounts of vegetation.
   Salem Bomofleh, director-general of the Agricultural Research
Center in the Saudi Red Sea port city of Jiddah, said some swarms
sighted in northern regions of the kingdom covered an area of 36
square miles.
   Two swarms were cited in Tabuk, where wheat is grown, but
Bamofleh said those swarms were ``completely controlled before
egg-laying'' by both ground teams and aerial spraying.
   Six swarms in the al-Jouf area, also a wheat-producing region,
have laid eggs that are expected to hatch in mid-May.
   ``Equipped and qualified teams are controlling the locusts
now,'' Bamofleh said by telephone. ``They are also surveying the
area to find out if more swarms have invaded.''
   But he said he did not expect the kingdom to experience any crop
damage from the invasion.
   The sightings have been confined to the country's northern
regions and there have been no reports of locusts in Riyadh, the
capital.
   In Oman, where locusts invaded a 14-mile stretch in the eastern
Sharqiya region two years ago and stripped the area of vegetation,
worried farmers raised the alarm when when they spotted a massive
swarm north of the capital Muscat last month.
   But when the investigating officials tracked it down to the
village of Bahla, the intruders were revealed to be grasshoppers.
   ``It was a case of mistaken identity,'' al-Mjeni said.
``Grasshoppers are attracted to light and, not surprisingly, they
congregated near the governor's office which is well illuminated at
night. People often mistake grasshoppers for locusts.''

   Ultra-nationalist extremists opposed
to a peace accord assassinated an official of President Junius R.
Jayewardene's governing party, police said Saturday.
   R.B. Henry, a local secretary of the United National Party, was
shot by two guerrillas of the outlawed People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese extremist group, on Friday in the northwestern town of
Kurunegala, said police who cannot be identified under briefing
rules.
   The extremists issued no statement to announced their motive,
but they have vowed to kill all backers of a July 29 India-Sri
Lanka peace accord.
   The agreement aims at ending a 4-year-old guerrilla war with
Tamils who want a homeland on part of the island off India's
southern coast.
   The government says the front has killed more than 200 members
and supporters of the United National Party since the accord was
signed.
   The front says the peace accord makes too many concessions to
Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese are 75 percent of the population.
   Tamil militants say their people suffers discrimination at the
hands of Sinhalese, who control the army and government.
   The main Tamil militant group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
has also rejected the peace accord.
   India has more than 50,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka to disarm the
Tigers and enforce the accord.

   The in-flight breakup of a 19-year-old Aloha
Airlines Boeing 737 has heightened concern about the safety of
older jetliners, but the problem has been known for years.
   Nearly a decade ago, the industry and its regulators agreed to
develop new safeguards against potentially catastrophic cracks and
corrosion, with a large portion of the nation's commercial fleet
already approaching old age. A program begun in 1983 covers nearly
1,000 planes now flying.
   But some aviation safety experts remained worried that while the
monitoring program looked good on paper, it might not always be
carried through and that federal regulators weren't able to
backstop all cases.
   According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the
agency has investigated more than 80 incidents and accidents
involving aircraft fatigue, cracks or corrosion since 1975, though
many were isolated to landing gear or engine problems. At least 15
cases involved cracks or corrosion on an aircraft's outer skin or
on control devices.
   On April 28, a 20-foot section of the upper cabin of an Aloha
Boeing 737 ripped away at 24,000 feet, exposing passengers to the
open air and sweeping a flight attendant to her death before the
pilot managed an emergency landing.
   Since then, the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered
renewed inspections of older Boeing 737s, including mandatory
high-frequency electronic testing of those that have more than
50,000 landings. But safety experts note that special visual
inspections of those planes, including the Aloha craft, already
were required at the time of the accident.
   The cause of the Aloha accident is yet to be determined
precisely. But the episode demonstrates a ``need to re-evaluate the
issues surrounding the aging fleet question, especially as it
relates to fatigue and corrosion cracking,'' suggests Joseph Nall,
the NTSB member who headed the initial investigation at Aloha last
week.
   Investigators are certain the accident stemmed from a structural
failure. The unanswered question is why did such a structural
problem on the 19-year-old airplane, which had nearly 90,000
landings, go undetected?
   Where did the system of warnings, inspections and preventative
maintenance go awry?
   ``It's one thing to issue a piece of paper. It's something else
to know with confidence that this stuff is being done the way you
know it can be done,'' says C.O. Miller, a veteran aviation safety
consultant and former government investigator. ``It isn't just a
simple issue of putting out an (FAA directive) or a service
bulletin.''
   Aloha officials have maintained all along that they complied
with all FAA directives in connection with the plane.
   According to the FAA, there are about 1,000 commercial jets _
Boeing 727s, 737s, 747s, McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and DC-8s _ that
are subject to the program designed in 1983 to monitor older
aircraft more closely for structural defects.
   ``The only reason there is the focus on the 737 is because it
had the accident,'' declares Ben Cosgrove, vice president for
engineering at the Boeing Airplane Co.
   The program was established after the airlines made it clear
they plan to keep their jets longer because declining fuel costs
lessened the attraction for investing in new, more fuel-efficient
planes. Whatever new jets are bought are usually flown to expand
service, rather than as replacements.
   As a result, since 1979 the average age of the aircraft fleet
belonging to the major airlines has increased from 10.28 years to
12.53 years, according to Avmark Inc., an Arlington, Va., aircraft
consulting and appraisal firm.
   ``There are probably about 2,300 airplanes now in service that
are fundamentally over 20 years old _ built before 1968,'' says
Boeing's Cosgrove. While these planes are capable of flying years
longer, after the 20-year mark ``you should start expecting to see
some more damage occur ... through fatigue and corrosion,'' he
acknowledges.
   But both Boeing and competitor McDonnell Douglas maintain that
with close inspections and prompt maintenance these jetliners
should have no problem flying well beyond their ``design life.''
   McDonnell Douglas, a few years ago, tested an old DC-9 to an
equivalent of 208,000 landing cycles to see how it would hold up.
As a result of the test ``we're very confident we have a DC-9 life
of at least 104,000 (landing) cycles,'' says J.J. McGrew, the
manufacturer's director of aircraft design.
   Different parts of the plane are affected differently, but the
strength of its fuselage and outer skin is most affected by the
number of takeoff and landings. Each time a plane is pressurized,
the cabin wall expands slightly and then when depressurized, it
retracts. That cycle can take its toll and can lead to a
potentially dangerous failure if critical parts, such as metal
joints, are weakened by corrosion, according to technical experts.
   The Aloha aircraft had nearly 90,000 such cycles in only 33,000
hours of flying, since most flights shuttled among the Hawaiian
islands.
   Ironically, it is such short-haul flights that often are served
by the older jets. Perhaps the most heavily traveled short-haul
system is Eastern Airlines' Washington-New York-Boston shuttle,
where 17 older Boeing 727s are in use.
   Each of the Eastern planes falls under the special FAA
inspection and maintenance program begun for older jets five years
ago, according to Roger Ferguson, Eastern's vice president for
maintenance and engineering, although none approach the number of
landings experienced by the Aloha aircraft.
   While maintenance costs for the older planes are higher _ as
much as 1{ times more for a 20 year-old plane as a 5-year-old craft
_ the older Boeing jets continue to perform economically, Ferguson
said. The planes, including the top of the fuselage, are visually
inspected for cracks every 1,100 landings, said Ferguson.
   John O'Brien, safety and engineering specialist at the Air Line
Pilots Association, says there is an inadequate number of FAA
inspectors, and complains that airlines occasionally ignore
maintenance bulletins from the manufacturers because they are not
mandatory. He says the FAA often is under pressure from the
industry not to issue mandatory directives except as ``a last
resort.''

<TEXT>
   Illinois Democrats divided the last of
their delegates between favorite sons Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson
on Saturday, although a party leader said Simon's delegates might
vote for someone else at the Democratic National Convention.
   Supporters of Jackson, who initially complained about Simon
receiving the delegates, said they were satisfied with the deal
struck Saturday and expected to pick up some those who defect from
the Illinois senator.
   ``If Paul is not there as a choice, I would suspect that many of
the people on the unity slate would vote for Reverand Jackson,''
said Leon Finney Jr., Jackson's Illinois campaign director.
   Simon received 47 delegates and Jackson 13, based on the results
of the state's March 15 primary. The individuals to serve in those
statewide slots were picked Saturday by the state party central
committee.
   Overall, Simon has 148 delegates from Illinois and Jackson has
41, most of whom were elected directly from the primary ballot by
congressional district.
   Simon was eligible for at-large delegates because he suspended
his campaign but did not formally drop out of the race. That tactic
angered supporters of Jackson, who ran second in Illinois and would
have collected all of the state's at-large delegates had Simon
dropped out.
   Some Jackson allies accused Simon of playing an unwitting role
in a stop-Jackson movement, and hinted that Simon might face a
black voter backlash should he seek re-election to the U.S. Senate
in 1990.
   State Democratic Chairman Vince Demuzio said he approached both
camps about a negotiated solution to the delegate disputes in hopes
of avoiding a split in the state party.
   ``It became clear that they were interested as we were in doing
this in a unified manner, and in a manner that was peaceful and
harmonious,'' he said.
   Demuzio said he could not dispute suggestions that Democratic
heavyweights pledged to Simon might feel free to cut their own
deals at the party convention in Atlanta.
   ``They have a moral obligation to vote for the candidate to
which they were pledged, but I think for the most part they will
likely be free agents,'' Demuzio said.
   Simon's operatives also acknowledged that some of their choices
for at-large delegates were dumped from the slate during
negotiations with the Jackson campaign.
   ``We both left a lot of blood on the streets as well as some
good and deserving people,'' said Jerry Sinclair, Simon's Illinois
campaign director.

   A lightning bolt hit a car and knocked

riding inside.
   ``It like scared me to death,'' said Zelda Smith, who was riding

   The Smith's, from Havana, Ill., were driving Friday near the
southwest Kansas town of Garden City when they saw the storm.
   ``We noticed streaks of lightning in front of us, but it was
clearing off and we figured everything was all right,'' said Smith,
70.
   The lighting caused the couple's car to stall. It would not
restart because the bolt traveled down into the car's computer box
and knocked out the car's electrical system, Smith said.
   Smith said he and his 69-year-old wife escaped injury.

   Residents returned to their homes
Saturday after a fiery explosion at a paper mill released toxic
chemical fumes, prompting the evacuation of about 2,600 people,
authorities said.
   Two people who complained of difficulty breathing were
hospitalized.
   The incident began when a seven-story boiler exploded shortly
after 9 p.m. Friday at the Appleton Papers Inc. plant, authorities
said. The fire was brought under control by midnight.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately determined,
officials said.
   ``My windows shook like a stick of dynamite went off when the
thing blew up,'' said Mary Ann Bathurst, who lives near the plant.
   After the fire was contained, the mill resumed operating around
3 a.m. on two alternate boilers, said mill Manager Jerry E. Wallace.
   The explosion occurred in a supply line containing the chemical
diphenyl oxide, a heat transfer fluid used in the drying process of
paper production, Wallace said. The chemical is highly toxic and
flammable.
   The evacuation order was issued around 10:30 p.m. as a
precautionary measure and lifted around 1 a.m.
   Two plant workers and five residents were treated at Nason
Hospital in Roaring Springs for eye irritations, nausea and
respiratory discomfort, said hospital spokeswoman Barbara Leamer.
   One of the seven was admitted and listed in fair condition
Saturday and a second was transferred to Altoona General Hospital
in good condition, Ms. Leamer said. She declined to release their
names.

   The government on Saturday banned half of
the city's taxis and cars from the Athens area in an emergency move
to improve air quality.
   Athens has been covered by a thick brown haze for three days.
   Aided by strong northerly breezes, the measures seemed to be
working.
   ``There has been a significant reduction in atmospheric
pollution because of the measures and improved weather
conditions,'' said Constantine Bourkas, director of the state-run
Program for Pollution Control.
   Bourkas said the wind, coming after two days of calm weather,
blew some of the pollution out of the mountain-ringed Athens basin.
   A brown smog hangs over Athens most of the year. It is formed
when a strip of cold air moves on top of a strip of warm air and
traps it over the city.
   The measures banned half of the city's 730,000 automobiles and
15,000 taxis from a 115-square-mile zone around the city center.
Only vehicles with license plates ending in odd numbers were
allowed in the area.
   They also ordered the city's 120 largest industries to reduce
output by 30 percent.
   The traffic measures lasted only until Saturday afternoon, while
the industrial restriction was ordered to last until 6 a.m. Sunday.
   The city's automobiles, diesel-powered taxis and aging buses are
mainly responsible for the pollution.

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is
preparing to issue its findings this week on the probable cause of
the crash last August of Northwest Flight 255, the second-deadliest
air disaster in U.S. history.
   The airplane, an MD-80, or stretch version of the DC-9, crashed
Aug. 16 just outside Detroit Metropolitan Airport while trying to
take off on a flight to Phoenix, Ariz.
   Just one person aboard the plane, a 4-year-old girl, survived
the crash. Her mother, father, brother and 153 other people were
killed.
   The girl, Cecelia Cichan, attracted gifts and letters from
around the nation while she was hospitalized.
   She is living with an aunt and uncle in Birmingham, Ala., and
relatives have pledged to make every effort to let the girl, now 5,
live as normal a life as possible.
   The NTSB scheduled a hearing Tuesday in Washington to issue its
finding of the probable cause of the crash, second only to the May
25, 1979, crash of a DC-10 at Chicago's O'Hare Airport that killed
275 people.
   The Northwest Airlines plane never got more than 50 feet off the
ground before it clipped a light pole in a parking lot, sliced a
chunk from the roof of a building and crashed onto a four-lane
highway.
   The plane broke apart while it skidded down the road, slamming
into a railroad trestle and two overpasses carrying traffic on
Interstate 94.
   The NTSB final report is expected to focus on the setting of the
airplane's flaps and slats, panels on the leading and trailing
edges of the wings that are extended to give aircraft extra lift
during takeoffs.
   Federal investigators have said the flaps on the doomed airplane
were not extended as they should have been for takeoff from the
airport's shortest runway.
   At an NTSB public hearing last November, several theories
emerged about why the flaps weren't set or why the crew wasn't
warned:
   _The pilot and copilot forgot. An NTSB transcript of a cockpit
voice recording during the half-hour before the crash has no
reference to a checklist procedure to check the setting of the
flaps and slats. But Northwest had an independent analysis done on
a copy of the tape and concluded that it contained ``flaps'' and
``flaps set'' command and response.
   _An alarm system designed to signal when flaps were set
improperly failed. There was testimony questioning the reliability
of a key circuit breaker within the system.
   _A crew member disabled the alarm system when the airplane
landed at Metro Airport after a flight from Saginaw. The cockpit
voice recorder's tape is a 30-minute loop which did not go back far
enough to catch the sound of the circuit breaker being pulled.
   More than a dozen court actions have been filed by survivors of
crash victims, and all have been moved to federal court in Detroit.
   The FBI and the Wayne County Sheriff's Department are still
looking for the mysterious Father John Irish, a man who posed as a
Roman Catholic priest and comforted the victims' families while
referring them to a Florida lawyer.
   A federal warrant has been issued for the man, who was charged
last October with fraud in Wayne County for accumulating about
$1,000 worth of hotel, food and telephone expenses paid for by
Northwest.

   ``The nicest thing my Mom ever did for me was

family a Mother's Day brunch.
   Nutimba Barra was among 600 grade-school students from Orleans
and Jefferson parishes to enter the contest sponsored by the Hyatt
Regency Hotel, which is giving the brunch Sunday.
   ``When I was just four days old, I was presented to my Mom like
a piece of merchandise on display in a store,'' reads the essay,
which Nutimba presented to his mother, Norvalee Barra, in a cover
decorated with a big, bright butterfly he drew.
   ``Had she not fallen in love with me on the spot, I would not be
me. Even my name would be different, I am sure.
   ``I am an adoptive child and I love my adoptive mom for loving
me,'' he concluded.
   Nutimba sees more of his mother than many kids whose mothers
work. Mrs. Barra is a teacher at Valena C. Jones Elementary School,
where Nutimba is a fourth-grader.

   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Saturday
that Soviet troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan under battle
conditions and indicated more may be killed.
   The Soviet news media has provided little coverage of the Soviet
military involvement in Afghanisan, but the Pravda article reported
comments of Red Army soldiers about the withdrawal and their slain
comrades. It apparently was designed to prepare Soviet citizens for
more deaths as the soldiers pull out.
   Under an April 14 agreement between Pakistan and Afghanistan,
the Soviet Union will begin on May 15 to withdraw its estimated
115,000 military personnel in Afghanistan. They entered Afghanistan
in December 1979 to help the Marxist government fight
anti-communist guerrillas.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called the war a
``bleeding wound'' for the Soviet Union, but Soviet casualties have
never been revealed.
   The Pravda article, headlined ``The Last Summer,'' said Soviet
troops were preparing to come home. It was accompanied by a picture
of three smiling soldiers.
   However, the daily newspaper said: ``The withdrawal of Soviet
units for home is a complicated operation. It will be carried out
in war conditions.''
   Pravda said rebels were continuing to fight Soviet and Afghan
government soldiers ``trying to spoil the process of
reconciliation'' and working to ``pile up weapons inside
Afghanistan, to create there stockpiles and bases.''
   It said the rebels were attacking cities, intimidating citizens
and committing sabotage.
   Pravda quoted one soldier, V. Malashkin, as telling about the
death of a friend who was captain of a helicopter shot down by
rebels on April 18. It said the pilot, Capt. Sergei Gusev, had left
a wife, son and daughter in Minsk. He had served in Afghanistan
eight months and had been decorated twice, according to the report.
   The Soviets have pledged to withdraw all their soldiers from
Afghanistan in nine months.

   Since the writers' strike in Hollywood has
held up filming fall episodes of ``Dallas,'' Larry Hagman used the
time off to rub elbows with the horsy set on Kentucky Derby weekend.
   Hagman, who plays the villainous J.R. Ewing on the prime-time
series, wore black beaded Reeboks and a watch engraved ``J.R.'' to
the annual party thrown by Preston and Anita Madden on the grounds
of their Hamburg Place.
   Hagman said the strike enabled him to attend the Derby party
Friday as well as the race itself on Saturday. Production of
``Dallas'' was to have resumed April 15, but has been delayed by
the 2-month-old scriptwriters' strike.
   Also among the 1,500 guests crowding in the large tent were Zsa
Zsa Gabor (``I love the horses the best, below my husband,
dahling'') and Annie Potts of ``Designing Women.''
   Potts, a Kentucky native who served as grand marshal of
Thursday's Pegasus Parade in Louisville, was impressed with the
festivities. ``This feels like a premiere tent, but there's no
kiss-kiss, hoochie-coochie. No one's trying to do business here _
at least not with me.''
   The crowd at the lawn party in Lexington, however, paled next to
the record numbers that showed up at the governor's mansion in
Frankfort. Gov. Wallace Wilkinson mailed out 25,000 invitations for
the traditional Governor's Derby Breakfast Saturday morning.
   Wilkinson and first lady Martha Wilkinson arrived by golf cart
at a giant white tent where state Department of Parks employees
served mountains of eggs, grits and country ham.
   At one point during the short trip from the Executive Mansion,
Wilkinson leapt off the car and grabbed a surprised guest for an
impromptu jitterbug.
   Because Wilkinson was using the breakfast to woo businesses to
the region, the guest list was heavy with the names of business
leaders. Wilkinson also entertained two fellow Democratic governors
_ Ned McWherter of Tennessee and Ray Mabus of Mississippi.
   Although no precise crowd figures were available, longtime
observers said the attendance was clearly the largest in the
breakfast's 52-year history.

<HEAD>U.S. Withdraws Diplomat from Singapore With `Deep Regret'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS two grafs background on U.S.-Singapore relations</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The State Department said on Saturday it was
forced to withdraw a diplomat from the U.S. embassy in Singapore,
but denied that Asian nation's charge the envoy meddled in internal
affairs.
   The first secretary in the U.S. mission in Singapore, E. Mason
Hendrickson, was withdrawn with ``deep regret'' at Singapore's
request even though he did nothing wrong, said Ben Justesen, a
State Department spokesman.
   According to the Singapore Home Affairs Ministry, Hendrickson
urged a group of lawyers to ``contest the elections against the
government and had involved himself in Singapore's domestic
politics.''
   ``It is perfectly legitimate for Hendrickson to keep in touch
with leaders of the constitutional opposition ... in order to
analyze and understand Singapore politics,'' the ministry said.
   But it said the diplomat had met with the lawyers ``in order to
attack the Singapore government, and instigate them to stand for
election against the government.''
   Justesen said Singapore asked the United States to withdraw
Hendrickson, who left the country Saturday in keeping with
established international law that gives a government the right
``without having to explain its decision'' to order a diplomat out.
   ``We do not accept the basis for the Singapore government's
request that Mr. Hendrickson be withdrawn _ that he acted in any
way improperly,'' Justesen said.
   He said the diplomat's activities ``were entirely in keeping
with normal diplomatic practice and his responsibilities'' as a
foreign service officer.
   ``In meeting with members of political opposition, which appears
to be the basis of the Singapore government's protest, Mr.
Hendrickson was doing what American diplomats are expected to do in
any country, namely to be in touch with a broad spectrum of
individuals in order to report accurately developments in the
country.''
   Justesen said the United States rejected Singapore's additional
request that two senior U.S. officials be reprimanded. The
officials were not named.
   The spokesman also said he could not provide biographical
information about Hendrickson.
   In the elections, to be held sometime before the end of next
year, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's People's Action Party is
overwhelmingly favored to retain control.
   The ministry statement said a lawyer, Patrick Seong, was
arrested April 19 and disclosed that Hendrickson had made appeals
to him.
   On Friday, the ministry said Francis Seow Tiang Siew, a
prominent lawyer, had been arrested under the Internal Security Act
for questioning into possible foreign interference in Singapore's
internal affairs.
   Earlier in the week, the ministry said foreigners were behind a
recent joint statement by dissident Singaporeans that they were
ill-treated while in jail and forced to confess to subversion.
   ``Singapore considers the U.S. to be a good friend. It values
the friendly and cordial ties it enjoys with the U.S. It wants to
maintain and build upon that long-term relationship,'' the ministry
said.
   The Reagan administration has had good relations with Singapore,
a prosperous former British colony in Southeast Asia. Though
American officials have occasionally said they disagree with
Singapore's restrictions on dissent and the press, U.S. expressions
of concern have been muted.
   There have been some economic disputes between the two
countries. Singapore has accused the United States of trade
protectionism and has joined in foreign denunciations of the trade
bill President Reagan says he will veto.

   An explosion damaged the downtown office of the
Avis car-rental company Saturday morning and witneses said at least
one person was injured.
   But the government said there were no casualties. It did not say
what caused the blast.
   The Kuwait News Agency quoted an Interior Ministry spokesman as
saying the explosion caused ``some damage'' to a car rental office
and the ceiling of a basement parking lot.
   According to witnesses the explosion occaurred at 7:23 a.m. in a
building complex used by several travel agencies including
U.S.-owned Avis.
   Kuwait, accused by Iran of aiding Iraq in the 7{-year-old
Iran-Iraq war, has been the target of a series of bombings in
recent years. Ivestigators suspect the bombs were placed by
pro-Iranian extremists.
   A bomb exploded April 27 in the Kuwait office of Saudi Arabia's
national airline, a block from the building where there was an
explosion Saturday.
   The airline office was bombed hours after the Saudis broke off
diplomatic relations with Iran.
   The Kuwaiti witnesses, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said an ambulance went to the travel-agency building
and they believed at least one person and possibly two had been
injured in the blast.
   Pro-Iranian extremists hijacked a Kuwait Airways jumbo jet April
5. They killed two Kuwaiti passengers before they were guaranteed
safety in exchange for freeing remaining passengers in Algiers 16
days later.
   The hijackers demanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in
Kuwait for a string of 1983 bombings in which five people were
killed. Kuwait refused to free the prisoners.

   Wearing a neck brace and leaning on a cane, the
younger son of Sen. Edward Kennedy left the hospital Saturday in
good spirits two weeks after surgery to remove a non-cancerous
tumor pressing against his spine.
   Patrick Kennedy, 20, praised the Massachusetts General Hospital
staff and said he will join his father's re-election effort after
some recuperation.
   ``It's been a long ordeal, but I'm thankful to the doctors and
nurses ...,'' said young Kennedy, who underwent neurosurgery on
April 21. ``It's meant a great deal to my family for so many
thoughtful words and prayers while I've been here. It's meant a
great deal to me. I'm looking forward to getting back.''
   Kennedy, a sophomore at Providence College in Rhode Island, was
admitted to the hospital April 18 after complaining of headaches
and pains in his back and legs for several months, said hospital
spokesman Martin Bander.
   Bander said the operation was completely successful and Kennedy
will return to the hospital in several weeks for a routine
examination.
   The senator, who accompanied his son from the hospital,
expressed relief. ``He's been through a great deal on it, but he's
back on his feet,'' said Kennedy.
   Patrick's older brother, Edward Kennedy Jr., 26, lost a leg to
bone cancer in 1973.

   A money-starved project to study
dolphin deaths along the East Coast is receiving a cash infusion
from the Navy and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   The Office of Naval Research has handed over $50,000 for the
dolphin study, and Tom McIntyre of the fisheries service said his
agency soon will chip in another $50,000.
   ``The animals are still dying. The Navy felt it was appropriate
that the investigation continue. They did a review of his proposal
and it was accepted. We are in the process of moving our money,''
McIntyre said Friday.
   The beneficiary is a task force headed by Canadian researcher
Dr. Joseph Geraci, who has anxiously awaited more money since the
study's funding ran out earlier this year.
   Geraci, professor of veterinary medicine in the pathology
department at the University of Guelph near Toronto, is a member of
the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission. The U.S. goverment asked him to
head the research begun last July when hundreds of dead dolphins
began washing ashore in New Jersey and Virginia. The deaths spread
down the coast, reaching Florida in November.
   Fisheries service statistics put the official East Coast dolphin
death toll at 742, but the actual number is probably much higher
because mammals that didn't wash ashore couldn't be counted.
   The cause of the deaths is unknown, although scientists believe
something is sapping the dolphins' immune systems, leaving them to
languish and die from common infections.
   The fisheries service fears that as much as 40 percent of the
East Coast's dolphin population has been wiped out.
   ``It could take decades to recover,'' said Lesley Scheele, a
dolphin project coordinator for the environmental group Greenpeace.

<TEXT>
   Notables of the opera world gathered Saturday
for a memorial to James McCracken, an internationally known tenor
who ``was a nobleman in the real sense of the word.''
   McCracken died last week at age 61, two weeks after suffering a
stroke.
   He was scheduled to sing in ``Il Trovatore'' at the Metropolitan
Opera in April but became ill after the dress rehearsal.
   His last New York appearance was in a concert version of
Respigi's ``La Fiamma'' at Carnegie Hall, and the Collegiate
Chorale, which sang that night, sang Verdi's ``Ave Maria'' at the
memorial service in Alice Tully Hall.
   McCracken's most famous role was ``Otello.'' Edward Purrington,
administrative director of the Washington Opera, where McCracken
sang his first ``Otello'' in 1960, spoke of his last opera
appearances, six Washington performances in ``Fidelio,'' this year.
   ``It surged with that unique energy that always characterized
his work,'' Purrington said. ``He was always a riveting presence
dramatically and vocally.''
   McCracken sang at the Metropolitan Opera 591 times during 34
years. Met executive Charles Riecker said during the hour-long
service:
   ``I never heard James McCracken say anything unkind about anyone
and I never heard anyone say anything unkind about him. He was
uniquely the favorite of the entire company. He was a nobleman in
the real sense of the word.''
   Also at the memorial was mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who sang
Carmen to McCracken's Don Jose in 1972 when ``Carmen'' opened the
Metropolitan Opera season.
   She sang two American songs _ ``Long Time Ago'' and ``(Shall We
Gather) At the River'' _ ``because he was a great American man.''
   Lotfi Mansouri, who has been named general director of the San
Francisco Opera, recounted how he went to the Zurich Opera in 1960
with McCracken and his wife, mezzo-soprano Sandra Warfield.
   Mansouri said the Swiss were amazed by the exuberant Irish tenor
from Gary, Ind., who sang in hospitals at Christmas and was always
ready to perform at benefits. ``He would throw himself into
everything like 200 percent.''
   He said McCracken sang ``Otello'' more than 30 times in his
first season in Zurich. ``And every performance got more exciting
and detailed. He never took it for granted. He never stopped
growing.''
   A long-time friend of McCracken, author Robert Daley, read
telegrams from singers Luciano Pavarotti and Franco Corelli. The
service began and ended with recordings by McCracken, an Irish song
and an aria from ``Otello.''

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf pvs, bgng: ``Bennett, who ...'' to CLARIFY
Bennett comments Saturday.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett, a magnet for controversy
throughout his 3{ years as secretary of education, is getting ready
to take an early fall departure from the Cabinet.
   Bennett told education writers in New Orleans last month that he
probably would resign then. His spokesman, Loye Miller, denied
rumors of a more imminent departure.
   What lies ahead for the brash, combative Bennett, who has
clashed repeatedly with teacher unions, quarreled with the surgeon
general over AIDS education, accused college presidents of being
greedy and upbraided Harvard and Stanford for changes in their
curriculum?
   Bennett, who delivered the commencement address Saturday at the
University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, was asked
following his speech whether he would resign this fall, and said he
hadn't made any definite plans. Asked about future employment,
Bennett quipped, ``USM hasn't offered me a position here.''
   He is expected to hit the lecture circuit and to write a book
capsulizing his critiques of the quality of America's schools and
colleges.
   Bennett, who converted from the Democratic to the Republican
party on May Day in 1986, has already proven a big draw on the GOP
fund-raising circuit, where he has been much in demand as an
after-dinner speaker.
   One speculated post is apparently not in the cards: the
vice-presidency on George Bush's tickets.
   Although Bennett is widely believed to have had his eye on that
spot, Bush has been conspicuously silent about Bennett during all
his talk about being ``the education president.'' Aids to Bennett,
who asked not to be identified, said they have had virtually no
contacts with the Bush camp in recent months, and Bennett is not
expecting to play any formal role in the Bush campaign.
   But Bennett is expected to attend his first Republican
convention in New Orleans this August, where party chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf has asked him to be on hand for the platform
deliberations, spokesman Miller said.
   In the past three years, according to the trade publication
Education Week, Bennett has spoken at 63 Republican functions
across the country.
   He has been a peripatetic Cabinet officer, visiting nearly 100
elementary and secondary schools and 50 campuses, and giving dozens
of speeches to school groups.
   Bennett, 44, was chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities for two years before succeeding T.H. Bell in the
Cabinet. Previously, he ran a humanities think-tank in North
Carolina and taught at several universities. He holds both a Ph.D.
in philosophy from the University of Texas and a law degree from
Harvard.
   He has been a relative ``pauper'' in Reagan's inner circle,
renting, not owning, a home in a pricey suburban Maryland
neighborhood. He and his wife, Elayne, have a young son.
   But his personal fortunes could pick up quickly if, as expected,
he lands a big advance contract for a book and pulls down lecture
fees running into thousands of dollars for each appearance.
   There has been speculation that Bennett may eventually run for
office, possibly from his adopted state of North Carolina. He
resisted an overture from Maryland GOP officials to seek the
nomination to challenge Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.
   Bennett said at the Education Writers Association meeting in New
Orleans April 17, ``I probably will step down in early fall. ...
People tell me that once you get past the convention, everyone
focuses on politics and it's hard to get other things done. If
that's the case, I will leave and see what's available.''
   Bennett said, ``I want to write a book that tells the truth
about education.''
   Bennett's latest report, ``American Education: Making It Work,''
concluded that the schools have improved somewhat over the past
five years, but still have a long way to go.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said he
rejected a U.S. ultimatum to resign and leave Panama but was
considering a Guatemalan proposal to end his country's political
and economic crisis.
   Guatemala said Saturday it has offered its help as mediator.
   Noriega, head of the country's 15,000-member Defense Forces and
de facto national leader, also said Assistant Secretary of State
Elliott Abrams is ``damaging the Reagan administration,
misinforming it and the U.S. public about the Panamanian reality.''
   Noriega was interviewed in Sajalices Friday after he inaugurated
a water line to the small community.
   The general said William G. Walker, deputy assistant secretary
of state for inter-American affairs, ``came in with an ultimatum''
in mid-March to leave in 48 hours. Noriega said he rejected it.
   Walker was in Panama at the time to discuss terms under which
Noriega might step down.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida last February on drug
trafficking charges. He calls the indictments politically motivated.
   Noriega said Friday he had received what he called a
``positive'' proposal for a possible solution to the dispute that
was submitted by Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo.
   He did not elaborate on the proposal, but said had had listened
to it with interest because, ``it comes from the region, it is more
in tune with Panamanian reality.''
   In Guatemala, presidential spokesman Julio Santos said Saturday
that Cerezo ``offered his mediation so that the Panamanian problem
is resolved by the peaceful and diplomatic route.''
   ``The government of Guatemala ratifies its offer to mediate the
Panamanian problem,'' he said. He gave no details of the offer.
   Guatemala's ambassador to Panama, retired Gen. Rodolfo Lobos
Zamora, has been called home twice for consultations about the
3-month-old crisis, Santos said.
   Sources close to Noriega who had access to the meetings with the
U.S. envoys in March said the general was offered an undisclosed
amount of money and immunity from extradition if he and ``25 of his
closest military collaborators'' left the country.
   Asked if he had been offered money, Noriega laughed and declined
comment saying, ``I do not want to make anyone's life difficult.''
   The general has offered to resign before Panamanian elections
scheduled for May 1989 subject to what he called a ``national
dialogue and a Panamanian solution.'' He has denied Washington
reports of a deal with the U.S. State Department under which he
would but remain in Panama.
   ``There are no negotiations,'' he said in the interview. ``We do
not negotiate the dignity of a country and do not negotiate the
dignity of a man.''
   He said he has talked with U.S. officials but not ``negotiated.
   Abrams, he said, has a ``specific plan'' of misinformation
because ``all his previous advice'' to President Reagan ``has been
a failure.
   ``It (the United States) does not want friendly governments, it
wants docile governments,'' he said. ``It does not want to win
friends. It wants to buy them.''
   U.S. economic sanctions, including freezing of Panama's national
bank assets in the United States and the refusal to pay tolls for
Panama Canal use, have caused a shortage of cash in a country that
uses the dollar as its national currency.
   The sanctions were ordered after President Eric Arturo Delvalle
tried to fire Noriega in late February, but Delvalle was voted out
of office the following day by Noriega supporters in Parliament.
The United States still recognizes Delvalle as the country's
president.

<TEXT>
   Two five-alarm fires broke out within a few
minutes of one another and about one block apart Saturday,
destroying five buildings and injuring three firefighters,
officials said.
   Fire Chief William J. McCrossen said arson is suspected because
of the timing. He said most, and possibly all, of the buildings
were vacant and that firefighters' injuries were minor.
   The first fire broke out in the back of a vacant two-story
wood-frame building, which collapsed during the blaze, and spread
to a two-story brick house and a vacant one-story house, McCrossen
said.
   Firefighters rushing to the blaze saw the other fire a block
away. It started in a two-story apartment building and spread to
the building next door.
   In Reserve, about 20 miles upriver from New Orleans, about 40
people were evacuated briefly Friday after a pilot light from a
clothes dryer apparently touched off fumes from gasoline being
pumped into an underground tank.
   Nobody was hurt in the blaze, which did about $60,000 worth of
damage in 30 minutes, sweeping through a maintenance garage and
trailer house, and exploding at least three tanks of acetylene and
oxygen used for welding, St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff's
spokesman Edward ``Tootie'' Nowell said.
   Thick black smoke poured from burning tires, fuel and other oily
equipment for more than an hour after the main fire was
extinguished. An emergency truck from the Marathon Petroleum
refinery in Garyville put those fires out with foam.
   Reserve is about 10 miles upriver from Norco, where an explosion
and fire at the Norco refinery last week killed six people, injured
42 and left one missing.

   Punk rockers hurled bottles and jumped
on cars in a melee that began when 200 youths were ordered out of a
dance club that had been burned earlier in the week, police said
Saturday.
   Eight adults and seven juveniles were arrested in the hourlong
disturbance late Friday at Fenders Ballroom, said Lt. Jim Reed. One
police officer reported a minor injury.
   Police were called at 9:26 p.m. with reports that people were on
the roof of the ballroom and that a crowd had spilled into the
streets. The crowd ignored an order to disperse and police declared
it an unlawful assembly, Reed said.
   Bottles were thrown and groups spread into neighboring streets,
knocking over newspaper racks and jumping atop cars. There was no
estimate of damage.
   About 30 police units were dispatched to quell the disturbance.
   Fenders Ballroom, which had been used as a punk rock dance club
on Friday and Saturday nights, was heavily damaged Monday in a
suspicious fire that also scorched an adjacent residential hotel.
Damage was estimated at $225,000.
   Fenders was formerly known as the International Grand Ballroom
and catered to a different clientele.

<HEAD>Governor Says He Sped, But Now He's Going 35 mph</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maryland's Gov. William Donald Schaefer
admits his chauffeur-driven limousine has gone too fast, but says
he's ``repenting.''
   Schaefer made his confession in a call to WFBR talk show host
Lester Kinsolving on Thursday night. Kinsolving, a foe of the 55
mph speed limit which Schaefer supports, has been urging listeners
to report in if they see the governor's car speeding.
   ``There's no gubernatorial immunity ...,'' Schaefer told
Kinsolving. ``Yeah, we are repenting all right. I'm almost going
crazy here doing 35 mph.''
   Kinsolving's ``Catch the Governor Speeding'' campaign had netted
several reports of Schaefer's car going at speeds up to 75 mph in
the previous couple of weeks.
   Schaefer's confession is not enough for Kinsolving. He wants to
frustrate the governor into withdrawing his opposition to raising
the speed limit to 65 mph, as 40 other states have.
   As for the governor, while he admitted that his car had gone
over the speed limit, he had nothing but nice things to say about
the state troopers who drive him.
   ``I want to just emphasize that the guys that drive me do a
superb job,'' he said. ``I don't tell them what to do. I don't
really watch them. I read the newspaper.''

   Leftist guerrillas attacked a police post near
Lake Titicaca with guns and home-made bombs, killing six officers
and a provincial judge, the Interior Ministry said Saturday.
   Elsewhere in the highlands, guerrillas of the Maoist Shining
Path movement also killed a government development official by
shooting him and then detonating a bomb in his car, Ayacucho police
reported.
   The police post attack occurred Thursday night in the Puno state
town of Crucero, located just north of Lake Titicaca near the
Bolivian border and 510 miles southeast of Lima, the ministry said
in a communique.
   Police battled the attackers for an hour before the rebels
destroyed the post by throwing the bombs, said the communique that
was published in the official gazette El Peruano.
   The report said a judge who was visiting the post also was
killed and the attackers fled on foot.
   It did not say how many policemen were at the post or if there
were any guerrilla casualties.
   The assassination in Ayacucho state occurred Friday about 50
miles south of the state capital of Ayacucho, which is 235 miles
southeast of Lima.
   Police said the slain man was a member of the governing Aprista
Party and a regional director of the Ayacucho State Development
Corporation.
   Shining Path rebels have been battling the government for eight
years.

   Winning Colors led every inch of the way
Saturday to capture the 114th Kentucky Derby by a neck, becoming
only the third filly to win the famed race.
   The barrel-chested roan withstood a desperate stretch run by
Forty Niner after the last turn. Risen Star finished third in the
17-horse field of 3-year-olds.
   Winning Colors' victory was a personal triumph for trainer D.
Wayne Lukas, who had entered 12 previous horses in the 1\-mile race
but had never won it. Jockey Gary Stevens also won his first Derby
in four tries.
   Noting that the filly's victory came the day before Mother's
Day, the 52-year-old Lukas said: ``I would like to salute all of
the women of America _ this one is for you gals.''
   Winning Colors had gone off as the 3-1 favorite along with the
unbeaten Private Terms, who finished eighth. She joins 1915 winner
Regret and 1980's Genuine Risk as the only fillies to win the
Derby. She carried 121 pounds, while her male rivals carried 126.
Her winning time was 2 minutes, 2 1@5 seconds.
   Owned by Eugene V. Klein, the former owner of football's San
Diego Chargers, Winning Colors paid $8.80, $5.20 and $4.60 in
earning $611,200 to boost her bankroll past the $1 million mark on
a career record of six wins and one second in seven starts.

<TEXT>
   An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at the
British Broadcasting Corporation's headquarters has increased to 19
confirmed cases and 45 suspected cases, the BBC said Saturday.
   Forty-one people are hospitalized and nine are seriously ill, a
corporation spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity in
keeping with British practice.
   Doctors dealing with the outbreak said they expected more cases
to develop in the next few days but they believed there was no
further risk of infection in the area around the buildings.
   The Department of Health wrote to Britain's district medical
officers on Friday, urging them to warn doctors to be on the
lookout for pneumonia victims who may have been near BBC
headquarters recently.
   Legionnaires' disease, which produces symptoms similar to
pneumonia, is often caused by bacteria from water-cooled air
conditioning units. The BBC said its air systems in the main
Broadcasting House and nearby Duchess Street building were
disinfected last week.
   The disease was first diagnosed in July 1976 after 221 people
contracted it in Philadelphia, and it takes its name from the
outbreak at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention there.
Thirty-four of the victims died. Doctors in the United States say
Legionnaires' disease has been fatal in about 15 percent of cases.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday
expressed approval of strikes by Polish workers and declared that
only fundamental political changes leading to democracy can resolve
the crisis in his homeland.
   Speaking with reporters aboard the special Boeing 747 Alitalia
plane at the start of a 12-day tour of four South American
countries, John Paul called a lack of democracy ``the central
problem of Poland.''
   The pope expressed moral support for the strikes that began in
communist Poland last month and said neither ``superficial''
reforms nor resorting to force by the government were the answer to
Poland's problems.
   The statements were his strongest since the labor unrest began.
   ``Certainly strikes are a justified method to defend justice in
the socio-economic and socio-political fields,'' and this is part
of the church's social doctrine, the pope said.
   He stressed the need for a dialogue and said ``here we are
touching the heart of the problem _ the problem of the lack of true
democracy. That I think is the crucial problem, the central problem
of Poland.''
   The Roman Catholic Church, which traditionally has played a
major role in predominantly Catholic Poland, supported Solidarity,
the first free labor union in the Soviet bloc when it was created
in 1980. Solidarity was suspended by the government in December
1981 and subsequently outlawed.
   John Paul said he had no reason to doubt Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's declared intentions for reforms but said ``it is not
easy to democratize a system that is by definition dictatorial and
totalitarian.''
   John Paul also took issue with moves in the U.S. Congress that
would single out Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay _ three of the four
countries on his itinerary _ for economic aid sanctions on grounds
they are failing to cooperate with the United States in the war on
drugs.
   ``Well, are there only these countries?'' he asked, raising his
voice. ``Are only these countries responsible and guilty. ... or
are there others that collaborate, that profit from this and are
not punished? If not whole countries, then groups.''
   The three countries need help, ``not a punishment or a
sanction,'' he added.
   A Vatican official traveling with the pope who briefed reporters
on grounds of anonymity said John Paul was referring to the
responsibility of drug consumers in the United States and other
countries as well as international traffickers.
   Drug trafficking and its international implications is expected
to be one of the pope's major themes as he travels to
cocaine-producing centers in Bolivia after ending his 46-hour visit
to Uruguay on Monday.

   Popular former Gov. Reubin Askew gave up
his bid for a U.S. Senate seat on Saturday even though he was
leading the race, saying ``it's just not right'' that candidates
must spend 75 percent of their time raising money.
   Askew said he also was motivated by a desire to spend more time
with his family. He said he would support a fellow Democrat, U.S.
Rep. Buddy MacKay of Ocala, for the Senate.
   ``I found myself increasingly concerned about the extraordinary
cost of running a statewide campaign in Florida today,'' Askew said
in a statement released by his campaign headquarters.
   ``Of course, I knew that before I announced my candidacy in
December. But, frankly, I underestimated the time and effort it
would take _ and how it would limit my ability to have more direct
contact with the voters.''
   The announcement stunned Democrats, who were losing a second
well-known candidate for the seat. Incumbent Sen. Lawton Chiles
announced in December that he would not seek election this fall to
a fourth term.
   ``That is a very devastating thing to have happen, a
front-runner withdraw from the race,'' said State Democratic Party
Chairman Charles Whitehead early Saturday, after published reports
in the Tallahasee Democrat and The Orlando Sentinel broke the story.
   Askew's war chest had reached $1 million, but a 1986 Senate race
in which former Gov. Bob Graham ousted Republican Paula Hawkins
cost both sides a total of $15 million.
   ``As I've said during this campaign, something is seriously
wrong with our system when many candidates for the Senate need to
spend 75 percent of their time raising money,'' Askew said. ``It's
just not right.''
   ``I hope the Senate will start bringing some reason to the
question of raising this much money,'' Askew said later at a news
conference at his Orlando law office.
   He said he originally believed he could get by with a $3.2
million budget, then he thought of limiting contributions but
realized he would still need $4.3 million, ``then it got to be $5.7
million.''
   Askew said the amount of time he would have to spend away from
his family was also ``at the forefront'' of his decision to qut the
race.
   ``The demands of the campaign reminded me forcefully of the
demands on my family,'' said Askew, with his wife, Donna, at his
side. They have two adult children.
   Askew, 59, was governor from 1971 to 1979, then served in the
Carter administration as a trade ambassador. He made a brief run
for the presidency in 1984, dropping out after finishing last in
the New Hampshire Democratic primary.
   He had held a commanding lead in published polls for the
Democratic nomination over his only official Democratic challenger,
U.S. Rep. Dan Mica. The primary is set for September. Polls also
showed Askew with a lead over the likely Republican challenger,
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack.
   ``I came to realize that I'm not prepared to reassume all the
demands of elective office,'' Askew's statement said.
   ``In recent weeks I have found myself treasuring a once-a-week
lunch break with (wife) Donna Lou at an Orlando lakeside restaurant
_ the only respite from the consuming demands of the campaign. And
we both know that those demands don't end on election day,'' Askew
said.
   Askew said he had informed MacKay of his decision early
Saturday. MacKay immediately said he would enter the Senate race,
and Askew said he would support and campaign for him.
   ``Buddy MacKay is running for the U.S. Senate. We will have an
offical announcement Monday,'' said Greg Farmer, MacKay's press
secretary.
   MacKay, 55, ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1980,
losing the primary to another Democrat who then lost the general
election to Hawkins.
   Farmer said Askew's decision was a stunning surprise, especially
following Chiles' withdrawal.
   ``Welcome to the Twilight Zone of politics. If you don't like
Florida's politics, wait five minutes and they'll change,'' said
Farmer.

   Tangled wreckage hampered the search for a worker still missing
Saturday in the wake of an explosion and fire at a Louisiana oil
refinery, while fire officials said California's tallest building
would remain closed indefinitely following a deadly fire.
   An official of a rocket fuel company whose plant exploded on the
edge of a Nevada town said a replacement plant would be built at a
more remote location.
   Six bodies had been recovered at the refinery. Two people died
in the Nevada blast, and the California disaster killed one person.
   Two crews worked through a maze of wrecked equipment Saturday at
the refinery at Norco, La., skirting small fires in the search for
the missing man.
   Shell Oil Co. spokesman Bill Gibson said company engineers and
safety and environmental experts were trying to find out what
caused the explosion.
   ``They've gotten out right out into the area, as close as they
safely could,'' he said Saturday.
   The causes of the three conflagrations, all of which began
during a 14-hour period Wednesday and Thursday, have not been
determined.
   In Los Angeles, fire officials were joined by state legislators
and local politicians in calling for a tough new law requiring
sprinklers in hundreds of older high-rises in the wake of the fire
late Wednesday and early Thursday that destroyed 4{ floors of the
62-story First Interstate Bank tower.
   The building was built in 1973, one year before a law was passed
requiring sprinklers in all new buildings over 75 feet tall.
   The building was ordered closed indefinitely Friday, said
Russell E. Lane, the city's chief building inspector. He said
repair work cannot begin until the steel superstructure is
extensively tested.
   In advance of that testing, ``we had the original architects and
engineers go in and they were very pleased with the shape of the
building,'' said bank vice president Simon Barker-Benfield. He said
a few people had been allowed into the building ``to begin the
process of salvaging files and that kind of thing.''
   Operators of the demolished Pacific Engineering & Production Co.
rocket fuel plant at Henderson, Nev., were fined four times in the
last five years for safety violations, but state officials defended
the plant Friday as having a ``good, moderate record'' overall.
   Company officials have also consulted with the FBI about the
possibility of sabotage, but do not consider it likely, said Keith
Rooker, Pacific Engineering's executive vice president, at a news
conference Saturday.
   Rooker said locations in more remote regions of Nevada, Texas
and Utah were being considered for a replacement for the plant
destroyed Wednesday.
   The plant had been given 10 citations from 11 state inspections
since 1983 but the problems were ``mostly minor,'' said Jim Barnes,
state industrial relations director.
   The company produced ammonium perchlorate, a component of the
solid rocket fuel used in some military missiles and the space
shuttle's booster rockets.
   Kerr-McGee Corp. makes the same chemical in a plant about a mile
closer to most of Henderson's residential area. That plant was shut
down voluntarily Thursday, and some worried residents want to keep
it closed.
   The blast damaged homes and businesses in Henderson and 326
people were treated for injuries.
   The explosion at a Shell Oil Co. refinery at Norco, La.,
shattered hundreds of windows in homes and stores in the area and
shook buildings in New Orleans, 30 miles to the east.
   ``The area is very much in disarray,'' plant manager Fred Foster
said Friday. ``There are large pieces of equipment off of
foundations and down around the cat cracker.''
   The catalytic cracker is used to break crude oil into usable
products.
   ``We still have a few small flames burning and so we have not
gotten into the unit,'' company spokeswoman Wendy Jacobs said
Saturday.
   The body of one Shell employee was found shortly after the blast
and five others were found Friday. One person was missing.
   The cause of the Los Angeles high-rise fire may never be known
because of the extreme heat of the blaze, said Fire Department
Battalion Chief Gary R. Bowie.
   The chief spokesman for First Interstate Bancorp discounted
arson speculation prompted by news that the company's capital
markets group, which employs 100 people on the floor where the fire
apparently broke out, was sold in a deal that closed Wednesday
night.
   ``I firmly belive that at this stage it's random chance,'' said
spokesman John Popovich. ``If the idea is that there is a
disgruntled employee, that would have been six months ago,'' when
the decision to sell was announced.
   A sprinkler system was being installed in the building but was
not yet complete. Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden
introduced a motion Friday to require owners of all high-rises to
install sprinkler systems.
   About 200 members of the California Fire Chiefs Association,
attending an annual convention, urged that sprinklers be required
in all buildings more than 75 feet tall.
   State Sen. Art Torres said Friday he will introduce a bill in
the state Legislature this week to require sprinklers in all
commercial high-rise structures in California.

<TEXT>
   An opposition group calling itself the Democratic
Union held an organizational meeting Saturday to establish a
political party as an alternative to the Communist Party, a leading
dissident said.
   Police, including some ranking officers, gathered outside the
downtown apartment building where the meeting was held, Sergei
Grigoryants said Sunday. He said he knew of no arrests.
   Grigoryants, who has been active among Moscow's dissidents, said
he went by the building but did not participate in the meeting.
   The Soviet Communist Party has ruled as the only official
political party since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and has given
no indication it is willing to accept any organized opposition.
   Attempts in the past to organize opposition parties have led to
arrests, imprisonment or exile.
   Grigoryants said the goal of the Democratic Union is creation of
a democratic, pluralistic society without a central role for the
Communist Party.
   He said as many as 250 people from Moscow, Leningrad,
Novosibirsk and the Ukraine gathered Saturday to discuss the goals
of the group and prepare documents declaring their principles.
There was no confirmation of that figure and few apartments in the
capital could accommodate such a large crowd.
   The talks are expected to continue for two or three days,
according to Grigoryants.
   The group gathered in the Krasnaya Presnaya neighborhood in an
apartment building near the modern office building housing the
government of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15
republics that make up the Soviet Union.
   Also meeting in Moscow this weekend were representatives of some
30 independent publications that have been established in defiance
of the government's monopoly on published information.
   The newspapers and journals, concerned primarily with political
and religious affairs, have limited circulation because the
government controls all printing presses. Some are only typewritten
sheets passed among friends.
   It was the second meeting of independent publishers. A similar
session was held in Leningrad last fall.
   Such open gatherings are an indication of the increased official
tolerance of dissent since Mikhail Gorbachev came to power three
years ago as Communist Party chief.
   Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, encourages greater
discussion of some issues and debate within the party apparatus.
But he and other officials have said glasnost has its limits, and
it is not clear how much opposition the government and party are
willing to tolerate.
   Democratization is one of the key words of Gorbachev's program
for reforming the Soviet system, but he has used it to mean greater
participation in the affairs of the government, party and state-run
enterprises.
   He has promoted democratization as a means of shaking up the
entrenched bureaucracy and installing a more aggressive leadership.
He has not, however, suggested the process should go so far as to
permit a direct challenge to the Communist Party's monopoly on
power.

<TEXT>
   Rocket manufacturer Morton Thiokol is
considering importing a fuel component used in space shuttle
boosters following the destruction of a Nevada fuel plant, a
company spokesman said Saturday.
   Tremendous explosions that flattened Pacific Engineering &
Production Co., killing two people and injuring 300 others, halted
production of the powerful oxidizer ammonium perchlorate, used in
the solid fuel that powers the booster rockets.
   The unexplained blast at Henderson, Nev., on Wednesday also
prompted the closure of a nearby Kerr-McGee Chemical Inc. plant,
the only other domestic source of the oxidizer.
   Buying the oxidizer from European sources is an alternative
being considered by Morton Thiokol and its customers, including the
Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said company spokesman Rocky Raab.
   ``We're considering all our options,'' he said. In the meantime,
the government and Morton Thiokol were assessing their fuel
inventories.
   Pacific Engineering lost nearly 3 million pounds of the oxidizer
that was to be delivered to the Air Force in June for use in the
Titan rocket program, said Keith Rooker, a company spokesman. The
company also provided oxidizer for the MX and Minuteman missiles,
key parts of the nation's nuclear defense.
   ``The loss of the manufacturing capability of the plant, if not
replaced, represents a serious threat to the national defense and a
crippling blow to the nation's space program,'' Rooker said at a
news conference Saturday in Las Vegas, Nev.
   Morton Thiokol representatives were in Nevada to discuss the
situation with Pacific Engineering and Kerr-McGee, but the
companies' spokesmen did not know the outcome of the talks.
   A spokesman for Kerr-McGee Corp. headquarters in Oklahoma City
said the company still had to determine when its operation could
resume and whether it should plan for increased production.
   ``If the government and its sub-contractors say they are going
to need enhanced production, Kerr-McGee will do everything possible
to comply,'' said the spokesman, Paul Reed.
   Manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate in Europe include the
National Society of Powders and Chemical in France and Chemische
Fabrik Uetikon in Switzerland.
   Morton Thiokol mixes the oxidizer with other materials at its
Wasatch Operations in northern Utah, making the solid fuel in
rocket casings, which are shipped to customers.
   The shuttle's motors are assembled with the rocket booster
segments at Kennedy Space Center. NASA officials have said that
since the rocket motors for the space shuttle Discovery arrived
months ago, the explosion will not cause a delay in the anticipated
summer launch of the first post-Challenger mission.
   Meanwhile, Pacific Engineering counsel Keith Rooker said
locations in more remote regions of Nevada, Texas and Utah were
being considered for a replacement for the demolished plant.
   The Kerr-McGee plant, 1{ mile from the Pacific Engineering
factory, was closed Thursday for damage assessment but company
spokesman Paul Reed said damages appeared to be confined to broken
windows, fallen plaster and sidings blown off by the force of the
blasts.

<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs after 13th: Uruguay legalized divorce... with
pope retiring for the night. Pick up 14th graf: Reports from the
Vatican...</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday began a
12-day, four-country mission to South America and told nominally
Roman Catholic Uruguayans to ``pay attention to the Christian
message.''
   ``Set your eyes on Jesus. This country was born Christian,'' the
pope said in this country where church and state are rigorously
divided, even to the point of calling Christmas ``Families Day.''
   Smiling and appearing relaxed after a 13{-hour flight from Rome,
John Paul, his white robes blown by a chilly fall wind, shook hands
with President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, a self-professed agnostic.
   The president, wearing a dark business suit, did not bow or kiss
the pope's ring as Latin American leaders often do. He welcomed the
pontiff in ``a spirit of tolerance, beyond religious beliefs,'' and
emphasized Uruguay's defense of civilian and religious freedom ``in
all its imaginable extensions.''
   Uruguay's 3 million people _ of whom 80 percent say they are
Catholic _ seemed lukewarm at best about the papal visit. The white
and yellow Vatican flags and the huge papal billboards that usually
herald the pontiff's arrival in Latin America were not in evidence.
   The pope did make page 1 of the Saturday edition of the
Montevideo newspaper, La Manana, but the main headline read,
``Measures Approved For Meat Sector,'' a reference to Uruguay's
important beef trade.
   When John Paul visited Uruguay for the first time last year,
there was public enthusiasm. But this time, as taxi driver Arturo
Branco put it, ``Perhaps the novelty is gone.''
   The pontiff received cheers and applause, however, from an
estimated 82,000 young people when he arrived at the Centenary
Soccer Stadium to address the nation's youth.
   The people cheered and shouted ``Viva'' _ long life _ as John
Paul told them to ``meditate on the message of Jesus'' and ``build
a more just and fraternal society.''
   They also applauded when the pope, standing on an outdoor stage,
urged them to be aware of abortion and divorce.
   ``Don't fear children who may come. Don't let civilian authority
put obstacles in the path of fecundity,'' the pontiff said.
Abortion was legal in Uruguay from 1934 to 1938 but now is illegal.
   ``Marital fidelity has not gome out of style,'' the pope said.
   Uruguay legalized divorce in 1907, becoming one of the first
Catholic countries to do so.
   Later Saturday the pope addressed about 500 religious leaders
and students at the Catholic University and told them to ``continue
working together to form a friendlier and more humane world, a
culture more truthful and more beautiful.''
   He then retired to the papal envoy's residence for the night.
   Reports from the Vatican said the pope would try to persuade
Uruguayans to think twice about their independent securalism, on
grounds that this is a country ``that does not reflect on its
destiny.''
   Uruguay, which is the size of Washington state and lies between
South American giants Brazil and Argentina, was a pioneer in
legalizing divorce, ousting Catholic church doctrine from public
schools, and even removing crucifixes from tax-supported hospitals.
   It changed the names of major holidays to take out religious
references and until 1984 resisted establishment of a Catholic
university.
   The church's only significatnt victory came in 1938 when it
successfully pressed for the repeal of a law legalizing abortion.
   President Sanguinetti, a civilian lawyer and journalist, says he
believes in God but not in formal religion.
   In the capital, Montevideo, John Paul planned to say an outdoor
Mass in a 82,000-capacity soccer stadium, meet with the nation's
bishops, and address students and representatives of the local
Protestant and Jewish communities.
   The pope's three-day stay in Uruguay also includes trips to
three interior towns. He plans five days in Bolivia, a major source
of the world's cocaine where government austerity measures to
eliminate 20,000 percent inflation have caused serious labor unrest.
   John Paul then heads for a 1{-day stay in Lima, the capital of
Peru, another major cocaine source and the scene of violence by
anti-government Marxist insurgents.
   The journey _ the pope's 37th foreign mission in his nearly 10
years in the Vatican _ ends with three days in Paraguay, which has
a reputation as an international center of smuggling. The pope
returns to Rome on May 18, his 68th birthday.

<HEAD>Gay Activists March for Better AIDS Funding, End to Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of activists marched for increased AIDS funding in a
downpour in California's capital Saturday, while hundreds more
participated in rallies in Washington, D.C., Albany, N.Y., and
elsewhere.
   In Rosemont, Ill., 10 people were arrested in a protest of what
they said was a 500 percent price increase for a drug to treat AIDS
by a company under federal scrutiny for quality-control measures.
   The demonstrations were part of a nationwide effort by gay
activists to call attention to the AIDS epidemic and discrimination
against homosexuals.
   The Sacramento march was one of the largest ever at the
California capital. State police estimated the crowd at 6,000 to
10,000 marchers, and organizers who had hoped for up to 50,000
people blamed the rain for lowering the turnout.
   Carrying signs that read ``Ignorance is the Real Disease'' and
placards from counties throughout the state, marchers chanted,
cheered and sang their way through the streets of downtown
Sacramento.
   A balloon-carrying delegation from politically conservative
Orange County chanted ``Orange County ain't so straight.'' Other
marchers, some wrapped in plastic trash bags to stay dry, chanted
``Fight AIDS, fight back.''
   Part of a makeshift stage on the capitol steps was set aside for
people with AIDS.
   ``I would've come even if I was very, very sick, because this
means something,'' said Bobby Kennedy, an AIDS patient from San
Francisco who sat bundled in blankets in a wheelchair. ``We're
living proof that what they're doing is not OK.''
   Marchers also rallied at the capitol steps in Albany, handing
out leaflets and displaying a quilt whose patches portrayed the
names of New Yorkers who have died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``We are demanding that Gov. Mario Cuomo and the state
legislature intensify their efforts to develop a comprehensive
range of services for people with AIDS,'' Libby Post of the New
York State Lesbian and Gay Lobby told the crowd of about 400.
   She said a state policy on AIDS should include quality health
care and housing for AIDS victims, an end to discrimination, access
to promising experimental treatment and an AIDS prevention program
for all New Yorkers.
   In the nation's capital, shouting, hand-clapping demonstrators
gathered across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, although
President Reagan was away for the weekend at his Camp David retreat.
   The demonstrators chanted, ``Reagan, Reagan, you can't hide; we
charge you with genocide.''
   Across the street, another group held up signs urging Reagan to
move more vigorously against the regime of Panamanian strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega. Together the two groups had about 200
protesters.
   In Ohio, about 100 people gathered in downtown Cincinnati for a
rally, where activists lauded federal plans to distribute pamphlets
on AIDS to every home in the United States. A march in Cleveland
also drew dozens of participants.
   The 10 Illinois protesters were charged with trespassing at the
corporate headquarters of LyphoMed Inc., maker of pentamidine, a
medication used to fight a form of pneumonia that frequently kills
people with AIDS.
   LyphoMed has been under investigation by the federal Food and
Drug Administration, which in a routine check last year found
underfilled vials of drugs and indications of contamination. The
company said it appointed a new director of quality control and
vowed to correct the problems.
   The protesters contend that LyphoMed has raised the price of
pentamidine 500 percent in the past three years. No one answered
the telephone at LyphoMed headquarters Saturday. Pharmaceutical
companies have said that the rapid expansion of knowledge about
AIDS makes research and development of drugs expensive and
speculative.
   ``A single bottle of this drug, about 300 milligrams, costs
$129,'' said Paul Adams, a spokesman for the protesters, members of
a group called Chicago For AIDS Rights, or C-Far, which numbers its
group at about 100.
   Organizers of the other demonstrations said they were affiliated
with various local gay rights groups and with national coalitions
going by the names ACT-NOW, for AIDS Coalition To Network, Organize
and Win, and Act-Up, for AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power.

<HEAD>Candidate for University President Withdraws Amid Plagiarism
Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Minnesota's interim
president apologized Saturday to the head of the school's Board of
Regents after withdrawing as a candidate for president at another
university amid plagiarism allegations.
   Board of Regents Chairman David Lebedoff said interim President
Richard Sauer called him to apologize for the incident in which
Sauer admitted lifting part of a presentation for the North Dakota
State University job from a magazine article without crediting it.
   Sauer has acknowledged that in a speech he has given several
times in the past six weeks he failed to credit the article.
   ``I got a phone call from Mr. Sauer and he apologized in a very
heartfelt manner for what he described as a `bad mistake' on his
part,'' Lebedoff said.
   Sauer called the lack of attribution ``a dumb thing to do.''
   ``I made a mistake of poor judgment, in retrospect, and I
apologize for that,'' he said. ``I don't think I explicitly said
they were my words, but I used them as an example of points to
consider and I didn't cite (the author's) name.''
   Asked if the incident could possibly lead to a call for Sauer to
step down as interim president, Lebedoff said, ``I don't want to
speculate on that.''
   Regents and lawmakers interviewed by The Associated Press
Saturday said they had heard no calls for Sauer's resignation and
expressed support for him.
   The 48-year-old Sauer was vice president of agriculture,
forestry and home economics at the university before becoming
interim president in March to replace Kenneth Keller. Keller
resigned amid controversy over cost overruns to renovate the
official residence of the university president and over a $200,000
renovation of his office suite.
   Sauer conceded Friday night that he had failed to credit the
article in the speech given at NDSU in Fargo, N.D., on Monday, but
said he had not been trying to claim authorship.
   He called William C. Nelson, chairman of North Dakota State
University's presidential search committee, to say he was
withdrawing from consideration, according to Nelson, who said he
unsuccessfully tried to get Sauer to remain a candidate.
   Sauer's speech was presented to several hundred professors,
faculty and students at a forum for the candidates. History
Professor Larry R. Peterson said he recognized part of the speech
as being nearly identical to points made by Cornell University
President Frank Rhodes in the May 22, 1985, edition of the
Chronicle of Higher Education.
   He said he forwarded the information to the presidential search
committee.
   However, the committee on Thursday recommended Sauer and three
others to the North Dakota Board of Higher Education after
accepting Sauer's explanation that he accidentally omitted the
credit in trying to shorten his speech, Nelson said.

<HEAD>Georgia Jury Ordered to Deliberate Sunday on Coleman Sentencing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors spent a fourth day deliberating
whether Wayne Carl Coleman should be executed for killing six
family members, but adjourned Saturday without reaching a decision.
   A rare Sunday session was ordered by Superior Judge Hugh Lawson,
with some participants in the case predicting deliberations could
continue into next week.
   Earlier Saturday, Lawson issued a partial recharge to the
jurors, telling them they should each listen to the views of the
others. ``The jury room is no place for the championship of causes
on either side of the issue. A juror should not be an advocate.''
   The retrial jury, which found Coleman guilty of six counts of
murder on Monday, began deliberating his sentence Wednesday
afternoon.
   Lawson has given no indication when he might halt the
deliberations. If the jury does not decide unanimously for his
execution, Coleman, whose original death sentence for the 1973
slayings was overturned on appeal, will be sentenced to life in
prison.
   Legal experts are divided on whether Coleman, who has served 15
years from his original conviction, would be immediately eligible
for parole consideration.
   Indications that the sequestered jurors were having difficulty
reaching a verdict surfaced Wednesday evening, when they reported
they were not close to completing their task. On Thursday, a female
juror sent Lawson a note telling him she had made up her mind and
wouldn't change it. That juror nodded repeatedly Friday as Lawson
reviewed the law regarding mitigating circumstances that might
justify a decision to spare his life.
   Coleman, Carl Isaacs and George Elder Dungee were convicted of
murder and sentenced to death in 1974 for the May 14, 1973,
killings of Ned Alday, his brother Aubrey, Ned's sons Jimmy, Jerry
and Chester, and Jerry's wife, Mary. The five men were shot one by
one in Jerry Alday's mobile home in rural Seminole County; Mary
Alday was killed in a nearby field after she was repeatedly raped.
   The convictions were overturned by a federal appeals court in
1985 because of excessive pretrial publicity. Isaacs was convicted
a second time and sentenced to death in January. Dungee is to be
retried later in Columbus.

   Former Gov. Reubin Askew's decision to
pull out of the U.S. Senate race Saturday sent several politicians
scrambling because of the likely impact on Senate, gubernatorial
and congressional races.
   ``It's a whole new ballgame,'' state Democratic Chairman Charles
Whitehead said Saturday after Askew made public a decision he had
revealed to other politicians the night before. ``Everybody was
burning up the phones last night.''
   Following the equally surprising December decision of three-term
Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles not to run for reelection, Askew
again deprived the the party of what it felt was a sure winner.
   ``If there ever was a gimmie, it was there,'' Whitehead said.
``It was his race to lose.''
   The Democratic nominee will likely face U.S. Rep. Connie Mack
III. The Republican from Cape Coral is doing well raising money and
can count on substantial help from the national Republican Party as
it tries to regain a Senate seat from Florida after Republican Sen.
Paula Hawkins lost to then-Gov. Bob Graham in 1986.
   Dan Miller, state president of the AFL-CIO and active among
state Democrats, called Askew's decision ``a real shame.''
   ``But it's still a long season. We have enough time,'' Miller
said.
   Miller suggested that Mack's boost from the Askew withdrawal may
be short-lived.
   ``I think Paula Hawkins and Rep. Bill McCollum (who both had
considered running this year for the Republican nomination) stayed
out because of Reubin Askew. They may change their minds now,''
Miller said.
   U.S. Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay of Ocala was poised to jump
into the Democratic race, which he had stayed out because of
Askew's candidacy. MacKay, who was endorsed by Askew Saturday,
scheduled a news conference for Monday and was expected to pick up
the support of Askew backers. He spent much of Saturday telephoning
Askew supporters.
   Rep. Dan Mica was the only announced Democratic candidate
remaining. He spent Saturday telephoning Florida Democrats from his
Washington office, hoping to take advantage of his headstart in the
Democratic race.
   Mica has a strong southeastern Florida base, but some Democrats
here Saturday speculated that another South Florida congressman,
Larry Smith of Hollywood, or other candidates might consider
joining the race.
   Other speculation as Florida state party officials and activists
met Saturday to name at-large delegates to the national
presidential convention centered on the domino effect.
   MacKay was among leading Democrats lining up for the right to
challenge Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in 1990, so his switch to
the Senate race could prompt others to join state Sen. George
Stuart of Orlando, the only announced candidate for governor.
   The opening of MacKay's seat could make an opportunity for state
House Speaker Jon Mills to go to Washington.
   There also was speculation that the Republicans' improved
chances of winning the Senate seat in November would probably make
national Democrats reluctant to open up another Senate seat by
pushing for Graham as a vice presidential nominee.

<HEAD>Video Version of Seer's Prediction Shakes Some Quake-Wary
Residents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seven-year-old docudrama narrated by the
late Orson Welles has many California residents panicked that an
earthquake could reduce the city to rubble this week.
   The hot-selling 1981 videotape, ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,''
dramatically interprets a vague prediction in verse by the
16th-century seer Nostradamus as proof that a planetary alignment
will cause an earthquake to level Los Angeles sometime in May.
   To make matters worse, astrologers have further narrowed the
prediction to say the quake is most likely to strike sometime this
week, possibly between Sunday and Thursday.
   Callers have clogged earthquake hotlines. Psychologists report
an increase in patients' anxieties. Moving companies have even
transported a few desperate souls completely out of quake-prone
California.
   Although many experts have called the film bunk and said there
is no planetary alignment during May, anxiety seems to be gaining
momentum.
   ``The phones are ringing pretty steadily,'' said Brenda Searcy,
a nurse answering crisis line phones at Charter Hospital in Long
Beach Friday night.
   ``They're really panicking. Some of them are shaky and crying,''
Ms. Searcy said. ``I've had a lot of parents call and say their
children can't sleep at night because of the predictions.''
   Ms. Searcy said she tells the callers ``the way I feel. I don't
believe there is going to be an earthquake.''
   The Griffith Observatory also established a hotline after
workers found themselves fielding dozens of calls a day, said
program supervisor John E. Mosley.
   The most common question: ``When will the planets line up?''
   The answer: ``There are no planetary alignments whatsoever in
the month of May.'' And even if there were, such alignments have
never been found to correspond to an earthquake, Mosley said.
   ``People don't need to worry,'' said Stewart Robb, an Anaheim,
Calif., author who has studied Nostradamus' prophesies for 48 years
and has written five books on the French seer.
   ``It's not Nostradamus. It's an Orson Welles movie.... I would
go so far as to say that even if there were a big quake in May, it
would still not give credit to Nostradamus.''
   Nevertheless, Elaine Young, a Beverly Hills real estate agent,
said her company has gotten calls from those who want to lease
their homes for the month.
   ``We had some inquiries in April from people asking if they
could be moved at the end of the month,'' said office manager Linda
Chavez of Western Mayflower moving company in suburban Montebello.
``They indicated they wanted to move because they feared the coming
quake.''
   The fears have been a boon to some.
   Ron Burke, marketing manager for the Sparkletts drinking water
company, said sales of containers designed to be stored for
earthquakes increased 500 percent during April.
   And Extend-A-Life, a Pasadena disaster supply company reported a
10-fold increase in sales last week of such things as purified
water, survival cookie bars, first-aid kits and thermal blankets.

<TEXT>
   About 6,000 Cuban exiles marched through the Little
Havana section of Miami on Saturday to protest the possibility of
normalized relations between the U.S. government and Fidel Castro's
communist regime.
   Exiles waved the Cuban flag, sang their homeland's national
anthem and spoke out against any formal relations with Castro's
government.
   ``For 30 years, the policy of the United States has been not to
send its people to Cuba because of the human rights position
there,'' said Rafael Penalver, leader of the Task Force of Cuban
Civic Organizations. ``Nothing has changed, and opening up
relations will not change Cuba.''
   Cuban-American leaders, longtime supporters of the Reagan
administration, say they feel betrayed by secret meetings of U.S.
and Cuban officials last year that resulted in a renewed
immigration pact.
   The leaders say such discussions legitimize the Castro regime
and could be a move toward formal ties between the two countries.
   Organizers of the march said more protests will be held unless
the U.S. government changes its position.

<HEAD>Strike Leader Says Management Agrees to Raise Pay</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS graf after 6th graf ``The speech...'' to ADD that
management earlier agreed to increase pay after talks with official
union.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a six-day strike at the
Lenin shipyard said Saturday that management generally agreed to
pay increases, reinstate fired activists and grant an amnesty for
strikers, sources said.
   Strike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski emerged from three
hours of talks Saturday evening smiling broadly and calling the
negotiations ``a big step forward.''
   According to witnesses, he told the strikers that management in
principle accepted the committee's demands to increase pay at least
$38 a month, reinstate fired Solidarity activists and grant amnesty
for the approximately 1,000 strikers occupying the plant.
   Three deputy directors of the shipyard taking part in the talks
refused to discuss demands for legalization of a Solidarity local
at the shipyard and freedom for political prisoners, saying those
issues were outside their competence, Szablewski said.
   A 15-minute audio broadcast by Solidarity, the illegal trade
federation, broke into the communist government's television news
at 9:30 p.m. in Gdansk. Solidarity founder Lech Walesa could be
heard telling strikers: ``You are to decide whether we accept or
fight for Solidarity. It's your decision. In the case of a
pacification (raid), I'll be the last to leave the shipyard.''
   The speech was taped at a rally in the shipyard after the talks
and broadcast a short time later, Solidarity sources said.
   Management already had expressed willingness in talks with the
official union to raise wages by about $38 a month, but it is the
first time management has engaged in talks with the unofficial
strike committee and, according to the sources, made the promise
directly to the strikers.
   The state-run news agency PAP filed a report saying no agreement
was reached but that talks were to continue Sunday.
   It said the shipyard was planning to raise pay by an unspecified
amount June 1 and quoted a prosecutor as saying strikers who give
up peacefully would not be arrested and that management said
strikers would not be fired.
   The PAP account made no mention of agreement to reinstate
Solidarity activists.
   Polish-born Pope John Paul II, on a visit of South America, said
Saturday that his countrymen are justified in striking. He said the
heart of Poland's crisis is ``the lack of true democracy.''
   Representatives of the Roman Catholic Church mediated the talks
at the shipyard's main office building, sources said.
   Walesa did not participate in the talks.
   Piotr Konopka, an aide to Walesa, said the meeting was important
because it meant the authorities had recognized that the strike
committee represented shipyard workers.
   Saturday's meeting was the first of its kind since the shipyard
strike began Monday in two weeks of labor upheaval that has been
the worst in Poland since the 1981 military crackdown.
   Riot police surrounded the yard Thursday, prompting fears that
they would storm the shipyard like they did the Nowa Huta steel
mill in Krakow on Thursday.
   Those fears diminished on Saturday, according to a strikers'
communique issued from the shipyard.
   ``The shipyard is still isolated from the city, but there is no
feeling of siege,'' the communique said.
   Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski of Gdansk, who was instrumental in
arranging the talks, said he was ``convinced that a solution
without use of force is possible.''
   Indeed, Konopka said the chief of security forces for Gdansk,
internal affairs Gen. Jerzy Andrzejewski, had guaranteed the
strikers' safety for the time being.
   In addition, a church source in Warsaw said the church had
received a promise that the strikers remaining in the shipyard, who
have not received food supplies since Thursday, would get food.
There also were attempts under way to allow strikers to see their
families.
   Inside the shipyard, ``The atmosphere is very good ... They feel
they are on a piece of free Polish land,'' Konopka said.
   Adam Michnik, a senior opposition activist, said the talks
proved ``the road of dialogue is possible.''
   Earlier, Michnik had said he believed Polish authorities would
force the strike to end by starving the workers.
   Solidarity contends the trade federation, outlawed following the
December 1981 martial law crackdown, should be legalized and
allowed to join in a dialogue to solve Poland's pressing economic
and social problems.
   Also on Saturday, two Solidarity members were sentenced to jail
for union activities.
   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz was sentenced
to six weeks in prison in connection with interviews he gave to
Western media.
   Onyszkiewicz was sentenced in Warsaw on a charge of
disseminating false information aimed at sparking arrest. In
Gdansk, Czeslaw Nowak, a Solidarity dockworker activist, was
sentenced to three months.
   The sentences followed Friday's sentencing of Bogdan Lis,
regional head of Solidarity for Gdansk, to three months in prison.
They were the harshest imposed on Solidarity members for union
activities since a 1986 political amnesty.
   Official pressure on Solidarity has stepped up since a wave of
at least five strikes hit the country beginning April 25.
   Besides the Lenin shipyard strike, there was a 10-day strike by
steelworkers in southern Poland, one-day bus driver strikes in
Bydgoszcz and Szczecin and a two-day strike by workers at the heavy
machinery plant in Stalowa Wola in southwest Poland.
   A communique issued Saturday by the shipyard strikers before the
talks described their mood as ``calm although not joyful.''
   Strikers' ``main problem'' was lack of food, cigarettes, hygiene
and ``bad weather,'' it said. Skies were overcast and cool Friday,
but improved somewhat Saturday.
   The communique made no mention of a suicide attempt Friday by
one young striker. After the attempt, Walesa gave a morale-building
talk and the strikers took steps to organize themselves more
effectively.
   Prices in Poland have risen 42 percent price so far this year as
part of the government's austerity program.
   In Washington, Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead
denounced the crackdown on strikers and said U.S. backing for
Poland's economic recovery plan will remain frozen until the
program wins popular support.

<TEXT>
   Governors past and present, cowboys and
Indians and thousands of other Texans gathered Saturday to throw a
100th birthday party for the pink granite Capitol building that
state leaders said symbolizes Texas.
   ``Texas today is as solid as these walls, and our future is as
bright as the gilded Lone Star held aloft by the Goddess of
Liberty,'' Gov. Bill Clements said in a speech moved into the House
chamber because of rain.
   Sporadic drizzle and gloomy skies forced cancellation of a
morning balloon race and thinned crowds for the Capitol Centennial
parade. But Clements and his wife, Rita, proclaimed the day a
success.
   ``The spirits weren't dampened by the wetness,'' Clements said
from the Governor's Mansion reviewing stand, from which he watched
the parade.
   Texas food was dished up alongside historical exhibits on the
Capitol grounds. Tepees were erected near a cavalry campsite. The
building itself remained festooned with Centennial Ball decorations
from the dance Friday night.
   Festivities included a blessing of the grounds by the First
American League, representing Indian tribes in Texas and Oklahoma.
Clements, Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby and House Speaker Gib Lewis received
ceremonial war bonnets and smoked a peace pipe with the Indians.
   The pipe had not been used since 1865 when the United States
signed a treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache tribes.
   R.C. Ahtone of Oklahoma, chairman of the Indian group, offered a
prayer in his native tongue and instructed the politicians to round
dance ``to make this thing complete.''
   Afterward, the governor and Mrs. Clements cut a giant
Capitol-shaped cake as children sang ``Happy Birthday.''
   Former Govs. Dolph Briscoe, John Connally, Preston Smith and
Price Daniel joined in the parade and House chamber ceremony.
Houston Daniel, a descendant of Sam Houston, read part of the May
16, 1888, Capitol dedication speech given by Temple Houston, a
state senator and son of Sam Houston, the pre-statehood governor.
   Several thousand people lined the parade route, but the rain
held the crowd to far below the 30,000 that organizers had
predicted would take part in at least part of the day's activities.

   Thousands of workers marched in the capital Saturday
to demand more jobs and financial help for southern Italy, where
unemployment has topped 20 percent.
   An estimated 200,000 people took part in what Italian news
agencies and state-run television called the largest such
demonstration in a decade.
   Protesters chanting ``work, work'' marched amid a sea of red
banners and blue and white stripped union flags. Many others waved
yellow placards demanding jobs.
   Unemployment last year dropped from 8.2 percent to 7.6 percent
in northern Italy and remained about 10 percent in the central part
of the country. But in the South, unemployement rose from 18.4
percent to 20.6 percent.
   Organizers said about 70,000 people demonstrated separately,
demanding higher salaries for teachers and recognition of their
independent negotiating committees.

   More than 1,500 protesters on
Saturday gathered in front of a house owned by a leader of a
right-wing political group, and police said the building was pelted
with rocks and paint-filled bags.
   Officials said the protest took place at a house owned by a
regional leader of the small Free German Workers Party in the
village of Mackenrode, located just east of Goettingen in the
southwest part of the country.
   There were no reports of arrests or injuries. The identity of
the party leader was not released.
   Police said several protesters carried placards that read ``Do
something against the Nazis.''
   Several hundred police had circled the house to prevent
demonstrators from entering the property, officials said.

   Ship traffic on the Calumet River, a vital route
for steel and grain, could be suspended up to four weeks while
crews try to untangle a freighter and a bridge that collapsed on
top of it, authorities said Saturday.
   The drawbridge and the 590-foot vessel collided near the
Illinois International Port District Friday night, but officials
still weren't sure if the bridge was lowered onto the ship or if
the freighter struck the span.
   There were no injuries among the 27-member crew.
   ``The Coast Guard is investigating the whole collision,'' said
Ensign Glena Hermes. ``Once they find out the who and the what,
they will be able to tell the how and the why. Until then the cause
is pure speculation.''
   In the worst case, 20 to 30 ships that travel Lake Michigan and
make deliveries via the Calumet River could be barred while the
steel mess is sorted out, said Coast Guard Lt. Chris Boegel.
   The cleanup could take only two days or as long as a month, he
said.
   ``This is discouraging for them,'' Boegel added, referring to
shippers. ``This bridge is blocking the entrance of the harbor from
Lake Michigan. That's where they drop off their steel.''
   The Illinois International Port District, also known as the Port
of Chicago, is near the Illinois-Indiana border in an gritty
industrial area with both shuttered and thriving steel plants.
   The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad bridge is tangled with the
Pondokratis, a ship registered in Cyprus, as the freighter was
heading through the river channel to Lake Michigan. The ship
traveled a few more yards, pulling the massive span with it.
   The ship had just unloaded steel and was bound for Duluth, Minn.
   ``The ship had 25 yards to go before it cleared the bridge,''
said Howard Schillaci, a sales clerk at Calumet Fisheries Inc., who
saw the accident.

   Strong thunderstorms with hail and a possibility of tornadoes
developed Saturday ahead of a cold front crossing the central part
of the nation, and a new storm spread rain over parched northern
California.
   Thunderstorms developed during the early afternoon over eastern
North Dakota and eastern South Dakota, and eastern Kansas and
northeastern Oklahoma.
   Tornado watches were posted during the late afternoon and early
evening for parts of the eastern Dakotas, western Minnesota,
northwestern Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.
   Hail the size of tennis balls pounded Shoreview, Minn., 9 miles
north of Minneapolis, and thunderstorm winds gusted to 60 mph at
Faribault, Minn.
   Thunderstorms in Oklahoma produced nickel-size hail south of El
Reno, and one-inch hail fell at Hazel, S.D., and Princeton, Kan.
   Behind the front, high wind continued to plague the central high
Plains.
   In Wyoming, wind gusted to 67 mph at Cheyenne and 80 mph at
Vedauwoo. A gust to 110 mph was reported on Table Mesa in northern
Colorado, and in the Nebraska Panhandle a gust to 71 hit Alliance,
the National Weather Service said.
   On Friday, high wind over Colorado shattered office building
windows, caused power outages and ripped the roofs off at least two
homes. Officials speculated that the wind may have been involved in
the crash of an Army helicopter at Fort Carson in which five
soldiers were injured.
   Brisk winds knocking down electric transmission lines caused
sparks that added to fire problems Saturday in northern Wisconsin
forests, where a shortage of rain has created an emergency, U.S.
Forest Service spokesman David Wester said. The fire damaged 50 to
70 acres of Chequamegon National Forest.
   Two feet of new snow fell at Cooke City, Mont., near Yellowstone
National Park, knocking out power to that area for much of the day.
Up to 20 inches of snow was reported in the Big Horn Mountains of
Wyoming. Lower elevations got heavy rain.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow was issued for some of the
mountains of south-central Wyoming.
   In the West, a storm out of the Gulf of Alaska spread rain over
the northern half of California, with snow at some higher
elevations, especially in the northern Sierra Nevada and around
Lake Tahoe.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Rawlins, Wyo., to 91 at McAllen, Texas. The low for the
day was 20 degrees at Flagstaff, Ariz.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the lower Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes region,
the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern Plains. Scattered
showers were forecast from the northern high Plains to the Great
Basin of Nevada and western Utah.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted from northern Arizona and the
Great Basin to the northern high Plains; in the 80s from the Rio
Grande Valley of Texas through the lower and middle Mississippi
Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast, and in the Southwest's
deserts; and in the 60s and 70s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Judge Bans Art Gallery From Selling Posters As Original Prints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has frozen the assets of an
Illinois-based group of art galleries accused of selling $50
posters at prices up to $5,000 and calling them hand-signed,
limited-edition prints by well-known artists.
   U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall has ordered Austin
Galleries not to represent the posters as hand-signed works by
Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Marc Chagall and other painters.
   Marshall issued the order after receiving a complaint from the
Federal Trade Commission. The FTC said Austin Galleries sold the
posters as original lithographs, when in fact the artist was not
involved in the production of the works.
   Donald Austin, president of the galleries, denied the accusation
in a statement, saying his businesses have sold the prints based on
information from suppliers.
   ``We believe that everything we have is authentic until proven
different,'' Stanley J. Adelman, a lawyer for the galleries, said
Saturday. Even art experts differ on how much control an artist
must have of a print before it is considered a limited-edition
issue, he said.
   ``The frames are worth more than the prints,'' said San
Francisco District Attorney Arlo Smith, who is assisting with the
investigation.
   The FTC also asked the court to issue a permanent order against
any misrepresentations in the sale of the artwork and to order the
company to make restitution to customers. The order freezes the
company's assets and allows FTC attorneys to inspect gallery
records.
   Austin Galleries, headquartered in suburban Palatine, has about
eight outlets in Illinois and California, Adelman said.
   The prints were sold at prices ranging from $200 to $5,000.
   ``We rely upon our suppliers to authenticate these works, and
I'm more interested than anyone that what we buy and sell is
authentic,'' said Austin.
   He said that in more than 20 years in the art field neither
Austin Galleries nor he has ``ever been involved in any lawsuit
even remotely suggesting that the works of art sold by us are
anything other than what they are represented to be.''
   It is company policy to give a refund if a customer secures a
written opinion from a ``recognized art expert'' that a print is
not authentic, said Austin.
   Adelman said the business would cooperate fully with the
government.

   The first Hans Christian Andersen
Ballet Performance Awards were presented Saturday during an
international performance at the Danish Royal Theater.
   Top awards went to Sylvie Guillem of the Paris Opera Ballet and
Irek Mukhamedov of the Soviet's Bolshoi Ballet.
   Ms. Guillem won the award for the best female performance in her
role as Odile-Odette in ``Swan Lake.'' Mukhamedov was selected as
best male performer for the role as ``Spartacus''.
   They were selected from dancers nominated by 38 ballet companies
in 22 countries.
   The H.C. Andersen Choreography Award was presented to Jiri
Kylian, artistic director of the Netherlands Dance Theater for his
choreography of ``L'Enfent et les Sortileges.'' Three Awards of
Merit were announced. They went to Frederick Ashton, leader of the
London Royal Ballet, and to Jerome Robbins and Peter Martins,
co-directors of the New York City Ballet.
   Dancers from various ballet troupes performed Saturday night.
   Ms. Guillem and Manuel Legris of the Paris Opera Ballet danced
the ``Grand Pas Classique.'' The Bolshoi's Mukhamedov and Natalia
Bessmertnova performed an excerpt from ``Spartacus.''
   Two dancers from the Beijing Ballet, Li Ying and Pang Jiabin,
presented a section of August Bournonville's ``The Flower Festival
at Genzano.''
   Cheryl Yeager and Julio Bocca of the American Ballet Theater
performed the pas de deux from ``Don Quixote''.
   The awards are named after fairy-tale master Hans Christian
Andersen. He was a friend of Bournonville, the famed 19th century
Danish choreographer.
   Many of Anderson's tales were the inspiration for ballets. For a
few years, he was a member of the ballet corps at the Danish Royal
Opera but was dismissed on grounds that his feet were too big.
   The awards are to be presented annually.

Marijuana</HEAD>

   A $2.5 million luxury yacht was seized Saturday
after a U.S. Coast Guard search turned up bits of marijuana on
board.
   Less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana was found in a
trash can, dresser and in the state room of the 133-foot Ark Royal
boarded in the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba, said Coast
Guard spokesman Luis Diaz.
   The seizure was the most extreme example yet of the Reagan
administration's new ``Zero Tolerance'' policy in applying laws
permitting confiscation of ships and vehicles used to transport
illegal drugs.
   ``It's the largest in terms of size and by far the most
expensive and luxurious vessel we've seized under this policy,''
Diaz said, adding that 12 boats have been seized since April 11.
Tractor-trailers have been seized along the Canadian border under a
similar program.
   The Coast Guard cutter Tampa stopped the yacht Saturday morning
to check paperwork and safety equipment, Diaz said.
   ``Just by accident, one of the officers spotted the marijuana in
the trash can and that prompted a thorough search of every corner
of the vessel,'' he said.
   The seized yacht was being brought to Key West Saturday night
along with the six people on board, who will probably not be
charged, Diaz said.
   ``We have been focusing all our efforts in recent years on just
the big smugglers, but drugs are a two-way street,'' Diaz said.
``This is the time we're making the users pay. It really has to
hurt to see a luxury yacht taken away for what basically amounts to
one joint.''
   Under the tougher Reagan administration policy, a seized boat
must be returned to its owners only if allegations of illegal drugs
on board are proved to be false. Otherwise, the boat is turned over
to U.S. Customs, which can sell it at auction.

exercise. ``Find a life's work worthy of yourself and your
heritage, commit yourself with all the zeal that you can muster and
throw yourself into it.''
   In Stillwater, the state's new higher education chancellor told

   Stewart, star of such films as ``It's A Wonderful Life,'' ``Mr.

   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) Veteran newsman and grammarian Edwin Newman
told graduates of North Carolina State University Saturday that
inflated language and poor grammar are dragging down the United
States.
   Speaking at a football stadium where three days earlier the rock
group Pink Floyd sang, ``We don't need no education,'' Newman said
Americans have become addicted to ``mush, to smog, to dull,
pompous, boneless, gassy language.''
   ``It's a grave handicap since there is a direct connection
between the skill and the efficiency with which a nation uses its
language and its ability to compete in the modern world,'' said
Newman.
   Meanwhile, Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National
Education Association, gave the Reagan administration an ``F-plus''
for its efforts on behalf of education, children and young people.
   ``And the only reason they get the `plus' is because Congress
... time after time, voted against the administration and said,
`the children of America are too important for us to do what you
want us to do,''' she told the 630 graduates of North Carolina
Central University in Durham.
   At the University of North Carolina at Asheville, the former
director of recruiting for the Peace Corps said the ``Me Decade''
may be giving way to the ``We Decade.''
   Robert L. Gale, who recruited for the Peace Corps from 1962 to
1965 and is now president of the Association of Governing Boards of
Universities and Colleges in Washington, D.C., said Americans may
be growing tired of the excesses of ``Me-ism.''
   ``Having learned that a 60-hour work week, a pile of money, and
all the material goods it buys won't necessarily make one feel
happy and fulfilled, young people in great numbers are again
becoming volunteers,'' Gale told the 306 graduates.

<HEAD>US Plans $10 Billion International Aid Plan For Philippines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is moving towards the
announcement of a multibillion-dollar international aid program to
help the beleaguered government of Philippines President Corazon
Aquino, a U.S. official said Saturday.
   The program, which has been likened by congressional proponents
to the 1947 Marshall Plan that rescued West Europe after World War
II, could lead to an international appeal for $10 billion over the
next five years, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   President Reagan also plans to send a high-level special
emissary to the Philippines to dramatize his concern about
conditions in that nation, The Washington Post reported in its
Sunday editions.
   The newspaper said the emissary, perhaps accompanied by senior
members of Congress, would be sent to Manila to deliver a signal of
top-level support and to consult with Aquino and her government on
details of the program.
   An American with international standing also may be picked to
coordinate the program, according to the Post. The newspaper quoted
sources as saying neither the special emissary nor the coordinator
has been chosen.
   The major elements of the program, the Post said, are U.S.
grants beginning in fiscal 1990, loans for development purposes,
debt relief in the form of reductions in scheduled payments and
debt-equity swaps, trade preferences to encourage Philippine
exports and investments from international financial institutions
and private business.
   The Post, citing unidentified sources, said $10 billion in new
aid over a five-year period has been discussed as the working
target within the administration and Congress.
   Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage in March said
Japan, South Korea, Australia and possibly the major European
allies would be asked to help finance the plan. He said Secretary
of State George P. Shultz had met with congressional members to
discuss the plan but that no total sum or concrete initiative
emerged.
   Last November, four lawmakers proposed that the United States
create a Marshall Plan for the Philippines to assist the nation in
overcoming its severe economic problems.
   The proposal to Reagan from Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and

outside the United States.

   Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson,
appealing for the support of California's large Hispanic
population, on Saturday proposed extending the immigrant amnesty
law for a year and moving the eligibility deadline from 1982 to
January 1987.
   The presidential contender also said the employer sanctions in
the new immigration legislation should be repealed as
discriminatory against workers and a burden to employers.
   Meanwhile, Jackson's chief rival for the party nomination,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, took a break from campaigning
to work on gubernatorial business and have a private weekend with
his wife, Kitty.
   Vice President George Bush, who has sewn up the Republican
nomination, also spent the weekend at home in the nation's capital.
   Bush continued to come under fire from Jackson for calling the
preacher-turned-politician a ``hustler from Chicago,'' despite
assurances from the vice president's campaign staff that there was
``nothing derogatory'' in his comments.
   ``I do not know why he would lash out at me,'' Jackson said
prior to marching in the Cinco De Mayo parade as the event's grand
marshal. ``He has a tendency when he panics to reach out and
attack.''
   Asked if this indicated how Bush, as president, would act under
stress, Jackson responded: ``We would be at national risk if he
were in that position. This tendency to be mean-spirited, to curse
at and to name call is a habit, a behavior pattern ... one who has
this office must have a sense of stability and security.''
   Bush told a group of Republicans in Lincoln, Neb., on Friday,
``I'm not going to be out-hustled by the hustler from Chicago or
from that traditional liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.''
   Stephen Hart, a spokesman for Bush, said the vice president
``was talking about how hard he (Jackson) has hustled.''
   In California, where about one-sixth of the voting age
population is Hispanic, Jackson spoke to a breakfast meeting of the
Latino Issues Forum, telling about 150 Hispanic leaders that the
phrase illegal aliens ``should apply to E.T. (the Extra-Terrestial)
but not to human beings.''
   ``People fleeing war or fleeing poverty should not be locked up
for the crime of wanting to be part of us,'' he said.
   Under the new federal immigration legislation, the deadline
passed last week for undocumented workers who have been in the
United States since 1982 to apply for legal resident status.
Employers who hire workers who do not have legal status are subject
to sanctions.
   The Jackson campaign cited Steve Teichner Poll figures from May
2 showing Jackson and front-runner Dukakis neck-and-neck in the
race for Hispanic votes in California, hich holds its primary June
7 with 314 delegates at stake.
   But Dukakis has proven popular among the nation's Hispanics
because of his fluency in Spanish. He has targeted the Latin
population by speaking Spanish in television ads.
   Jackson is strongest among urban Hispanics in the Los Angeles
and San Francisco Bay areas, and weakest among those in Orange
County and the laborers of the San Joaquin agricultural valley of
central California.
   Jackson later Saturday addressed a gay rights rally of about
4,000 people outside the state Capitol in Sacramento and lashed out
at a California ballot measure that calls for a quarantine of AIDS
victims.
   He called it a ``hate-based`` measure backed by supporters of
political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, and said, ``Shame on us for
entertaining such an idea.''
   Jackson flew back to Southern California for a fund-raiser in
San Dimas before heading to Greensboro, N.C., to speak Sunday at
the college graduation of his two sons.
   In Illinois, backers of Jackson and Paul Simon called a truce in
their squabble over the state's at-large delegates to the national
convention as party leaders elected a ``unity slate'' of 47
delegates for the Illinois senator and 13 for Jackson.
   Simon, who received the bulk of the state's at-large delegates
with his victory in Illinois' March 15 primary, suspended his
presidential campaign last month. That tactic angered supporters of
Jackson, who finished second in Illinois and would have collected
all of the state's at-large delegates had Simon dropped out.
   Overall, Simon has 148 of Illinois' 187 Democratic delegates,
while Jackson has 41.
   In Wyoming, Dukakis gained two delegates at the state Democratic
convention for a total of seven delegates, while Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. held on to his six delegates despite the suspension
of his campaign.
   Jackson picked up three delegates and two delegates remain
uncommitted.
   At the state convention in Nevada, Dukakis gained three
delegates for a total of 12, Jackson gained one delegate for a
total of four and Gore lost one delegate, leaving him with six. One
delegate remained uncommitted.
   In Alabama, Democrats held an executive committee meeting to
finalize delegates to the national convention in Atlanta, July
18-21.
   Arriving in San Francisco Friday night, Jackson was feted at a
glittering Fairmont Hotel voter registration dinner attended by
about 1,000 prominent state Democrats, financial supporters and
celebrities, including actor Martin Sheen, and actress Jane Fonda
and her husband, Assemblyman Tom Hayden of Santa Monica.
   Jackson, attacking Reagan administration economic policies,
urged party expansion to ``the common people on whose shoulders our
victories always come.''
   Jackson, on the one hand made a plea for party unity, but also
warned that his constituency among these common people might
abandon the Democrats if their concerns are not addressed. ``When
they withdraw no one can win,'' he said.
   ``I really want to win in November, but the party must win, and
the nation must be saved,'' Jackson said.

   An official of Panama's Christian Democratic Party
arrived Friday, expelled from his homeland after being arrested,
beaten on his feet with a rock and held overnight in prison, an
immigration official said.
   Party Secretary General Ivan Romero was detained Thursday when
he flew to Panama after a weeklong visit to the United States, said
Perry Rivkind, local director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   ``They apparently interpreted something he said in New York as
unflattering to Gen. (Manuel Antonio) Noriega,'' Rivkind said.
   Noriega is under indictment for alleged drug trafficking in
Florida, and the United States has called for his ouster from power.
   Romero told INS officials here he was taken to a military prison
immediately upon his arrival in Panama. ``He said they held him for
seven hours and beat him on his feet with a rock a little,'' said
Rivkind.
   His captors then drove him to the airport and put him on a plane
to Miami.

<HEAD>Judge Rules For Special Chicago Mayoral Election in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Friday that a special election
should be held next year to choose a successor to the late Mayor
Harold Washington, a decision that drew cheers from courtroom
spectators.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Eugene Wachowski had to call for order
to quell the jubilant reaction. But a spokesman for the losing
side, which backs a 1991 election date, vowed to appeal to the
Illinois Supreme Court.
   Alderman Timothy Evans, an opponent of Mayor Eugene Sawyer,
called the ruling a victory for the people of Chicago. Asked
whether he'll be a candidate in the next election, Evans said,
``You'll have to tune in to see.''
   There was no immediate comment from Sawyer, who was not directly
involved in the case. Mayoral spokesman Monroe Anderson was not in
his office.
   The City Council chose Sawyer over Evans at a raucous, all-night
meeting a week after Washington, the city's first black mayor, died
of a heart attack Nov. 25.
   Though both Evans and Sawyer are black, Sawyer was elected
primarily through the backing of the city council's old-guard white
aldermen. Hundreds of Washington and Evans loyalists had thronged
City Hall, protesting that ``back-room deals'' were cutting voters
out of the decision-making process.
   ``It's a marvelous, marvelous victory for all of those citizens
... who came down to La Salle Street and stood in the City Hall
rotunda imploring their aldermen to listen to them,'' said a
smiling Evans as he emerged from Friday's hearing.
   In his ruling, Wachowski said he believed state law clearly
granted the city Board of Elections Commissioners authority to call
a special election in the spring of 1989, as the board did earlier
this week.
   Attorney Russ Stewart, representing a group called United
Citizens of Chicago and Illinois, had argued that Sawyer was
properly elected by the City Council and should be allowed to serve
until 1991, when Washington's second term would have ended. The
group denied any ties to Sawyer.
   But attorneys for a group calling itself The Coalition To Let
The People Decide in 1989 argued successfully that Illinois law
clearly requires a special election if a municipal officer dies or
resigns with more than 28 months remaining in his or her term.
   ``The question before you,'' attorney Tom Johnson told the
judge, ``is whether the voters, the people in the neighborhoods,
will have a chance to participate in deciding who will govern the
city of Chicago for the remainder of (Washington's) 48-month term.''
   Former GOP mayoral candidate Kenneth Hurst, president of the
United Citizens, said he would appeal Wachowski's decision. He
described his group as a non-partisan watchdog organization seeking
fair government.
   Alderman David Orr, who served briefly as interim mayor after
Washington's death, called the ruling ``a defeat for Mayor Sawyer
in that he mistakenly let his followers say they favored 1991.''
   ``He let the public believe he preferred 1991, and I think that
was a mistake, because you never want to tell the public they don't
have the right to choose who their leader will be,'' Orr said.

<HEAD>Man in `Make-My-Day' Law Case Gets Life for Murder of Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who successfully used a
``make-my-day'' defense in the killing of a neighbor was sentenced
Friday to life in prison for the murder of his estranged wife.
   David Guenther, 35, who shot to death his wife, Pamela, and
wounded her boyfriend outside a restaurant last year, cannot be
considered for parole for 40 years, District Judge Harlan Bockman
ruled.
   Guenther also was given a consecutive eight-year term for
wounding Stanley Stinson.
   As he left court and got into a police car, Guenther told
reporters, ``I'll have another trial someday, hopefully in about a
year.'' His lawyers have already planned an appeal.
   Stinson, who attended the sentencing, said he was angry that the
parole restriction was not stiffer, saying it should have been for
at least 80 years.
   In April 1986, Guenther fatally shot one neighbor and wounded
two other people in the climax to a neighborhood feud. A judge
ruled he acted lawfully under the state's new ``make my day'' law,
which allows residents to use deadly force in their homes against
intruders.
   The name comes from a Clint Eastwood movie in which he plays a
police officer who urges a criminal to shoot at him so he'll have a
reason to fire back. Eastwood's character says, ``Go ahead, make my
day.''
   However, the Colorado Supreme Court overturned that ruling and
made Guenther stand trial. A jury acquitted him last October,
finding he acted in self-defense.
   But by then, Guenther was charged with killing his 30-year-old
wife and injuring Stinson.
   The Guenthers' children, Christopher, 13, and Jennifer, 11,
witnessed the March 1, 1987, shootings, and were key prosecution
witnesses.
   Disagreement at the trial was not over whether Guenther fired
the shots. However, the prosecution contended Guenther acted with
deliberation, while the defense claimed Guenther fired eights shots
from his pistol in the ``heat of passion'' as he saw his wife
kissing Stinson.
   Prosecutors said the attack followed a sequence of threats and
violence by Guenther against Mrs. Guenther, who had taken the
children and left him a month before she was killed.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo is ``moving'' from a house
he doesn't live in now to another house, where he also won't live.
And even though he won't live there, he won't miss out on one of
New York City's charms _ it's taxes.
   Such are the wonders of official residences, voting residences
and tax codes. The bottom line: A residence is not a home.
   Cuomo, 55, and his wife Matilda, 56, are selling a house in the
borough of Queens that they've owned for almost 30 years; they're
switching their official residence to his mother's nearby home.
   Of course, home is the Executive Mansion in Albany, 160 miles
away. The Cuomos have lived there for five years, and plan to stay
a few more.
   By selling the Queens house after turning 55, the Cuomos are
taking advantage of tax laws that exempt the first $125,000 in
profit. If they buy a replacement residence within two years
they'll further reduce their liability.
   By maintaining a Queens address, the Cuomos will be able to vote
there _ but they will also have to continue paying New York City
income tax.
   The house was built for the Cuomos by his father in 1959 and
sold to the couple for $28,000. It sold Thursday for $320,000,
according to a Friday release.
   The Cuomos expressed sadness about selling the modest two-story
wood-frame house where they raised their five children.
   ``We built our house as we built our family, one piece at a
time,'' Cuomo said in a statement. ``We take with us the warm
memories of nearly three decades and leave behind our hope that
future owners will find in this house the same magnificent home it
has been for our family.''

   Paramours pressed for privacy can check into
communist Cuba's new ``date house'' in Havana, a low-budget love
nest that guarantees at least six hours of secrecy.
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said Friday the lovers' inn
is the first built in Havana ``in 30 years of revolution.''
   Couples who lack privacy because of Cuba's housing shortage
might be interested in the inn, the news agency said, as would
``pairs of sweethearts, conquering Don Juans and unhappy wives.''
   It said a small cabin is available for a minimum six hours at a
moderate price. The facility has ``all the comforts and services
that the most demanding users might require.
   ``The modern cabins with air conditioning, indirect music and
food and drink services contrast openly with the old buildings
where all days at all hours couples line up waiting for a chance to
share a room that, the majority of times, is far distant from being
a paradise for love,'' Prensa Latina reported.

   Motorists encountering the sign of the
turtle along a two-mile stretch of rural highway will be advised to
adopt the ways of the tortoise and creep along the road.
   The signs, featuring a bold profile of a turtle, advise
motorists to slow down and help preserve a threatened species of
turtle that resembles its common wood cousin.
   Female Blanding's turtles, best recognized by a bright yellow
throat and dark, high-domed shell, cross area roadways from mid-May
to mid-June to nesting sites. Then, in the fall, turtle offspring
go back across the road to be with their parents.
   The turtle-crossing signs, posted Thursday in the Weaver area of
Wabasha County in southeastern Minnesota, are as rare as the
turtles themselves. The only other place in the nation known to
have turtle-crossing signs is May County, N.J., according to Joan
Galli of the state Department of Natural Resources.

<HEAD>Shultz Denounces Proposal For New Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, attacking
two congressional actions, on Friday denounced a new South African
sanctions proposal and called the trade bill ``one of those
1,000-page monstrosities.''
   At a luncheon honoring former members of the foreign service,
Shultz said the two measures were examples of what he called a
disturbing new American trend toward insularity.
   ``There's an instinct coming out in this country of `stop the
world I want to get off,' but we can't get off,'' Shultz said.
   He said an omnibus trade bill passed by Congress that President
Reagan has vowed to veto would protect American markets at a time
when the U.S. trade deficit is narrowing and the United States does
not need to be shielded from foreign goods.
   ``It's ironic because we are the biggest exporters in the
world,'' Shultz said.
   ``It's one of those 1,000-page monstrosities and you hardly dare
say what is in it and what's not in it,'' Shultz said of the bill.
   ``United States competitiveness is asserting itself and all the
moonshine about how we're flat on our backs and not able to do
anything is shown to be just that,'' he said.
   In a slap at Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., a dropout in the race
for the presidential nomination, Shultz said, ``I was interested to
see what happened to the candidate for president in the primaries
who made protection his shining light. He didn't get very far.''
   ``We can't let voices of discouragement and special interests
lead us away from ideas that have worked in the past toward the
ideas that have failed in the past,'' Shultz said.
   The secretary repeated administration assertions that a bill to
increase sanctions to pressure South Africa to end its restrictive
racial policies would be counterproductive because it would cut the
United States' ability to influence that government constructively.
   Shultz said, ``If we see something we don't like we have a
tendency to say let's get out of there.
   ``The instinct of it is to say we don't like apartheid,
therefore let's throw up our hands and leave. That's not the
American instinct of the old days,'' he said.
   Legislation to toughen sanctions against South Africa was
approved Tuesday by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and appears
to have widespread support in the Democratic-controlled House. It
faces strong Republican opposition and could undergo changes in the
GOP-dominated Senate.
   Shultz also railed against foreign aid and operations budget
cuts instituted by Congress over his objections. One of the
programs to be hurt will be U.S. aid to Afghan refugees.
   ``Where we're going to find funds for that is beyond me,''
Shultz said. ``We're broke. The country's going great, but the
government's broke. And our foreign affairs picture is broke.''

<HEAD>Investigation Into Actor's Auto Death Under Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police official said
Friday that an investigation was under way at family request into
the single-car death here of British-born actor George Rose.
   Lt. Manuel Raboso, chief of the Homicide Investigation
Department in the Caribbean resort of Puerto Plata, said in a
telephone interview, ``We are carrying out an investigation and it
will be completed as soon as possible. Right now, I can't say what
happened.''
   Police said Thursday that Rose, 68, winner of two Tony awards on
Broadway for his roles in ``Drood'' and ``My Fair Lady,'' was
killed when his car, going at high speed, swerved into a ditch and
turned over several times in the northern Dominican Republic.
   Raboso said Friday that the investigation in part centered on
two head wounds suffered by Rose, ``both ... on the forehead.''
   He said ``the investigation is being carried out at the reguest
of friends and Juan Rose, the actor's adopted son.'' Raboso added
that his department routinely investigates all deaths, including
traffic deaths.
   Rose owned a beach home just outside the town of Sosua, about 15
miles east of Puerto Plata, near where the car wreck occurred.
   Police officer Jose Nunez said the crash occurred about 10:30
p.m. Wednesday less than a mile east of Puerto Plata, but
authorities were not aware of it until early Thursday.
   Raboso said the accident may have occurred ``early Thursday''
rather than Wednesday night. He said he based his conclusion on the
condition of Rose's body.
   Nunez had said that Rose was apparently alone when the car went
into the ditch. He was reported killed immediately. The body was
taken to Ricardo Limardo Hospital in Puerto Plata, 160 miles
northwest of Santo Domingo.
   Rose, a remarkably versatile actor who was as much at home
playing Shakespeare as he was in a comedy or a musical, had lived
in New York City since 1961.
   He preferred the stage, but also appeared in scores of film and
television productions.

<HEAD>Marines Get Only Six Female Embassy Guard Applicants in Initial
Call</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps, under orders to allow women
to work as embassy security guards, has accepted its first group of
women into a training school after failing to generate much
immediate interest.
   According to a spokesman for the corps, only six female Marines
applied by the deadline to enter the next class at the Marine
Security Guard School at Quantico, Va., which begins on May 17.
   ``Of those six applicants, five have been accepted,'' Lt. Col.
John Shotwell, the spokesman, said Friday.
   Shotwell said the five female Marines would join 150 enlisted
men in the next class.
   He declined to say whether the corps was surprised or
disappointed with the low turnout of female applicants, but noted
there had been little advance notice of the change in policy
regarding security guards.
   ``The announcement was made during the first week of April, and
the deadline for applications was May 1,'' Shotwell said.
   The Marine Corps has maintained a strict men-only policy
regarding embassy security guards ever since it ended an experiment
with female guards in 1979. Fifteen women were assigned to foreign
posts during that brief pilot program, which was discontinued after
attacks on embassies in Pakistan and Iran.
   The commandant of the Marines, Gen. Alfred M. Gray, has made it
plain in recent months he would prefer to maintain the male-only
policy because he wants combat-ready Marines serving in the jobs _
and combat jobs aren't open to women.
   Gray's objections were overridden three months ago, however, by
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who heeded the recommendation
of an advisory panel and ordered the positions opened. That move
was part of a campaign by civilian officials at the Pentagon to
counter criticism that the military services are discriminating
against women in job opportunities and doing too little to stop
sexual harassment.
   There are currently about 1,400 Marines serving in the embassy
security force, guarding 140 posts in 127 countries. The guard
force became the object of unwanted publicity a year ago because of
a spy-and-sex scandal involving Marines in Moscow.
   Gray and the Marine Corps leadership so far have refused to say
how many of the embassy guard positions will be opened to women,
citing the need to study everything from available housing to the
threat of terrorism and cultural considerations.
   ``There was no quota for female applicants (in the first
class),'' Shotwell said. ``Each applicant was judged on his or her
own merits. As to whether we'll see more applications in the
future, I won't speculate.''

   A federal judge, rejecting a legal challenge by
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, ruled Friday that Congress and the
president can order National Guard troops to go on training
missions over a governor's objections.
   The ruling, the second by a U.S. District Court answering recent
challenges to federal authority, apparently will force the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination to send a
Massachusetts contingent of 13 public relations officers to
Honduras and Panama later this month.
   Dukakis, a critic of Reagan administration policy in Central
America, had filed suit trying to block the two-week assignment.
   He said in a statement that he would appeal the decision,
contending, ``The Reagan administration is using National Guard
training in Central America as part of its ill-advised and illegal
strategy to overthrow the Nicaraguan government.''
   However, the governor is not seeking a stay of the ruling
pending appeal.
   ``The real issue here is not the sending of public relations
people to Honduras,'' press secretary James Dorsey said. ``The much
larger issue is the overridinig constitutional issue and sending
troops down there as a destabilizing policy. What you need, to
obtain a stay, is to demonstrate that irreparable harm would occur.
No one is going to be foolish enough to say this would cause
irreparable harm.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton, in the opinion upholding the
federal Department of Defense, said federal authorities have the
power to give orders to National Guard members because the troops
are sworn to federal duty as well as state duty.
   Lawyers for the Justice Department had argued that the ``Army
Clause'' in the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate say over
the nation's entire military apparatus.
   The Massachusetts attorney general's office, representing
Dukakis, had contended the ``Militia Clause'' reserved power to the
governors over training the militia.
   ``Under the Militia Act of 1792,'' Keeton wrote, ``virtually
every able-bodied man between 18 and 45 was enrolled in the militia
and required to arm himself at his own expense. This statute was
the only permanent legislation organizing the militia for over 100
years.''
   But in the 20th century, that status changed, he said, with the
key step being a 1933 law that made the National Guard a permanent
part of the U.S. Army through the device of dual enlistment.
   Citing previous federal court rulings from the Vietnam era,
Keeton said Congress had the power under the Constitution to pass
the 1933 law.

   Key witnesses in a suit accusing Contras and U.S.
officials of running a guns-for-drugs smuggling ring have been
threatened with prosecution to block damaging revelations about
Vice President George Bush, attorneys charged Friday.
   Bush, head of the CIA in 1976, allegedly allowed some of the
suit's defendants, including his covert operations chief, Theodore
Shackley, to set up an underground ``secret team'' to hide their
activities from the incoming Carter administration, said
plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Sheehan.
   ``They were running covert operations for Bush,'' Sheehan told
U.S. District Judge James King. ``Then they set up an off-the-shelf
operation.''
   Sheehan said an effort to intimidate witnesses and cripple the
suit has prevented revelations that could hurt Bush in his
presidential campaign.
   But defense attorney Theodore Klein, who represents three of the
29 defendants, dismissed the Bush-CIA conection as a ploy by
Sheehan, saying Sheehan cannot ``provide a single witness'' to
prove the case.
   ``I don't know where George Bush comes in all of a sudden,''
Klein told the judge. ``I think it bears witness to their political
motivation.''
   The arguments came up during a hearing on the case, which has a
June 29 trial date. The plaintiffs made a number of requests, which
the judge took under advisement and is expected to rule on next
week.
   The $24 million damage and racketeering suit charges that the
defendants _ including indicted Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord
and Albert Hakim _ supplied the Contras with weapons in trade for
cocaine through a secret illegal network. The suit also accuses the
group of planning the May 1984 bombing that injured maverick rebel
leader Eden Pastora in Nicaragua.
   Sheehan works for the liberal Washington-based Christic
Institute, which represents the plaintiffs, journalists Tony
Avirgan and Martha Honey. Avirgan was slightly injured in the 1984
bombing.
   Sheehan's assistant, Lewis Pitts, said that when he tried to
interview mercenary Jack Terrell and others about the smuggling
operation, they told him they had been threatened with indictment
if they gave any statements.
   FBI agents and a Miami grand jury were ``used to silence these
little people, to interfere with the investigation,'' Pitts told
the judge. ``We have concerns about political factors affecting
judicial decisions.''
   Thomas Spencer, attorney for former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub,
attacked the plaintiffs for failing to stick to the point of the
suit, damages to Avirgan and Honey.
   ``They are attempting to use this forum to launch their
political arguments,'' said Spencer.
   Pitts argued that the judge could grant immunity to the
plaintiff's witnesses, usually only a prerogative of prosecutors.
But Klein said such an order violated the constitutional separation
of powers.
   Sheehan sought the right to depose witnesses going back for a
10-year period, including the time Bush was head of the CIA,
instead of the four years as King initially granted. The judge
warned that the trial was unlikely to be delayed.
   King denied discussing the suit with U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell, who is handling the Iran-Contra criminal cases in
Washington. Gesell had said in court he would not allow the civil
suit to interfere with the criminal cases against Oliver North and
the other Iran-Contra defendants.

Rescue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Skyscraper Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman rescued from the 37th floor of a
burning skyscraper said her last thought before passing out from
the thick smoke was, ``Sunday's my birthday and I'm not ever going
to be there to turn 29.''
   Melinda Skaar was trapped for more than three hours Wednesday
before losing consciousness as a fire in the First Interstate Bank
tower spread from the 12th to the 16th floors and spewed smoke
throughout its 62 stories.
   ``This is it, I'm going to die,'' Skaar, a financial analyst,
said she told herself as she and Stephen Oskas, an assistant vice
president at the bank, fled from room to room to escape the heavy
smoke.
   One person died and at least 40 people were injured before the
fire was extinguished early Thursday, four hours after it began.
   Roberto Lopez, a janitor, said he was certain he was going to
die in the 50th-floor closet where he sought refuge from the thick
smoke.
   ``I didn't think I had any chance of surviving,'' he recalled.
   Lopez, who has worked at the high-rise for 11 years, said his
final thoughts before passing out were of his family and his
childhood in Mexico.
   Firefighters carried him to the roof, where he was airlifted to
safety. He was listed in fair condition at County-USC Medical
Center Friday.
   Skar and Oskas, who had stayed to work late, were overcome by
smoke by the time firefighters reached them and carried them to
safety.
   Skaar said she thought of her boyfriend of eight years and her
birthday. ``I thought, `Sunday's my birthday and I'm not ever going
to be there to turn 29,''' she said.
   Ms. Skaar was hospitalized at Good Samaritan Hospital to recover
from smoke inhalation. Oskas, who was listed in stable condition at
Queen of Angels Hospital, declined to be interviewed.
   Ms. Skaar said that after the thick smoke kept her and Oskas
from getting down the stairs, they looked for offices with the
least smoke. They tried to break the building's thick windows by
hurling furniture and file cabinets, only to watch the objects
bounce off.
   Rescuers found them shortly after they collapsed.
   ``All I remember is seeing these bodies a few minutes later,''
she said. ``Strong bodies that weren't like ours, bodies that could
walk and breathe and had equipment with them and would rescue us.''

<HEAD>Boy, 7, Held In Bathroom For As Long As Four Years, Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old boy who had been kept virtually a
prisoner in a bathroom, possibly for several years, was being
treated for malnutrition after he escaped through a window,
authorities said.
   The boy's parents were jailed on charges of injury to a child by
omission after their arrest Thursday night in what police are
terming one of the worst instances of child abuse they had seen.
   Alexander Lizcano Jimenez, 38, and his wife, Charlotte Anne
Bishop, 42, appeared Friday before State District Judge Patricia
Lykos, who increased the previous bond of $2,000 to $10,000 apiece
and appointed attorneys for the couple.
   The boy, Bannoy Jimenez, told authorities he escaped Wednesday
by climbing through the bathroom window of the family apartment,
then wandered to a service station where the attendant fed him a
hamburger and fries and called police, said police juvenile officer
A.G. DeWoody.
   ``What you have here is a boy who has been deprived of a
childhood,'' DeWoody said. ``No television, no toys, no love.''
   DeWoody said the boy resembled a child from a famine-stricken
country. He had shoulder-length hair and his stomach was bloated
from malnutrition, he said. DeWoody estimated he could have been
held in the bathroom for as long as four years.
   Bannoy was being treated for severe malnutrition at Ben Taub
Hospital. The couple's three other children _ a 10-year-old girl
and 9-year-old twins, a boy and a girl _ were placed in the custody
of county child welfare authorities. They showed no signs of
physical abuse.
   Authorities said the boy was fed a cold meal once a day and
shared the bathroom with two dogs. Judy Hay, spokeswoman for Harris
County Child Protective Services, said the boy also was bruised and
complained that his back and ribs hurt.
   ``Caseworkers here were astounded,'' Ms. Hay said. ``He looks
like a very hungry 4-year-old. It's just unbelievable.''
   For all the boy's problems, though, he was able to speak freely,
Ms. Hay said.
   ``He instantly had a great rapport with our caseworkers,'' she
said. ``It's pretty bizarre _ definitely.''
   Ms. Hay said the child's sisters and brother may have been
abused, although not physically. She described them as very upset
and refusing initially to talk with authorities.
   Randy Holzapple, attorney for the father, said after the Friday
court appearance that he hadn't had much chance to talk to his
client.
   ``I know very little about them, even less about the case,'' he
said. ``Why is one child singled out? That's what's really
perplexing everybody. It really breaks your heart.''
   DeWoody said although the boy is 7, he had no concept of time
and believed he was 3. At the hospital, he said, ``They gave him
toys and he didn't want to give them back.'' The boy also tried to
hoard the food he was given, he said.
   ``I don't know how much communication he had with his family,''
the officer said. ``He heard voices through the door and possibly
learned some communication like that.''
   Holzapple said a grand jury would consider the case to decide if
further charges should be filed. Conviction on the
injury-to-a-child charge carries a maximum sentence of life or 99
years in prison.

<TEXT>
   Sen. John Glenn said Friday he would
consider an offer to run for vice president on the 1988 Democratic
ticket but will not seek it and has not encouraged speculation
about it.
   At a news conference, the Ohio Democrat said the vice presidency
``is not an office you campaign for,'' and that recent plugs for
him by Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste and others have been strictly
their own doing.
   ``All of these things have been occurring without one word from
me or my office,'' Glenn said. But he said that if he is asked by
likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, he would be glad to ``to
sit down and discuss it.''
   Glenn's own presidential bid in 1984 faltered early in the
primary season. Four years later, his debt still stands at about $2
million.

<HEAD>JFK Most Feared George Romney As Re-Election Opponent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1963, President Kennedy feared then-Michigan
Gov. George Romney more as a potential re-election opponent than
Richard Nixon, Nelson Rockefeller or Barry Goldwater.
   Kennedy's worries about Romney are revealed in a book about the
late president's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, to be published next
month by Bantam Books.
   The book, ``Robert Kennedy: In His Own Words,'' includes the
transcript of a December 1964 interview with Anthony Lewis of the
New York Times, in which Robert Kennedy said his brother thought
Romney would be ``so difficult to soak.''
   Robert Kennedy also told Lewis in the previously unpublished
interview that John Kennedy thought Goldwater would have been the
easiest opponent to beat. Goldwater won the GOP nomination in 1964
and was defeated soundly by Lyndon Johnson.
   Romney's 1968 presidential hopes burst when he said after a
visit to Vietnam, ``When I came back from Vietnam (in 1965) I had
just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get when you go
over to Vietnam...not only by the generals but also by the
diplomatic corps over there, and they do a very thorough job.''

   A top Iowa Democrat said Friday he has
launched an effort to draft Bob Strauss, a Texas businessman and
former national head of the party, as a running mate for likely
nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``Bob Strauss can't be tagged as a liberal, he can't be tagged
as a conservative _ he's a national Democrat,'' said Ed Campbell, a
former chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party who ran unsuccessfully
for the party's nomination for governor.
   Campbell said he has been encouraged in talks with Democratic
leaders in Washington as well as with low-level Dukakis staffers.
   He said Strauss would offer both regional and philosophical
balance to a Dukakis ticket, as well as experience in philosophical
balance to a Dukakis ticket, as well as experience in foriegn
affairs.
   ``I want to win this time, I think every Democrat wants to
win,'' he said. ``I think a Dukakis-Strauss ticket would be
dynamite.''

<HEAD>Network Executives To Testify At Poll Closing Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives from all three television networks
are scheduled to testify next week at a Senate committee hearing on
legislation that would set a uniform closing time for polls
nationwide.
   The Senate Rules Committee hearing will come less than a month
after the president of NBC News indicated he was uncomfortable with
an agreement with Congress not to project the winner of the
presidential election until all polls close.
   Washington Democratic Rep. Al Swift, House sponsor of the bill,
and other Western lawmakers have argued that network projections
have discouraged people from voting and even affected outcomes of
close local and state elections in the West.
   Under the proposed bill, polls would close simultaneously across
the country at 9 p.m. EST on Election Day. In the Pacific Time
Zone, daylight savings time would be extended by a maximum of two
weeks during presidential election years, allowing polls to close
at 7 p.m.
   The bill, approved by the House late last year, will not cover
the 1988 presidential election.

the fiery disasters in three cities that killed at least six people
this week:

   REFINERY BLAST
   In Norco, La., workers searched the ruins of a Shell Oil Co.
refinery, looking for four men still missing since explosions
Thursday killed three and injured 42. The bodies of two workers
were found earlier Friday.
   Small fires fed by oil and gas residue in the tangle of pipes
and equipment still burned in the blast area.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the
Environmental Protection Agency sent investigators to the plant.

   SKYSCRAPER FIRE
   In Los Angeles, a city councilman said he will propose a law
requiring automatic fire sprinklers in all city high-rises
following Thursday's fire in the 62-story First Interstate Bank
tower that killed one person and injured 40.
   First Interstate officials discounted speculation that word of
pending layoffs in the company division on the floor where the fire
broke out could have prompted arson.
   City fire officials had yet to determine the cause of the blaze
that caused $450 million in damage. Federal investigators from the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were taking part in the
investigation.

   PLANT BLAST
   In Henderson, Nev., city officials met with executives from
Kerr-McGee Corp., which also makes the rocket fuel manufactured at
the now-leveled Pacific Engineering and Production Co. plant.
Kerr-McGee, located a mile from the blast site, shut down Thursday,
saying they will not reopen until they know more about the accident.
   Damage estimates topped $100 million from the explosions
Wednesday that killed two people. Nearly a third of the city's
16,000 homeowners had already filed damage claims by Friday.

<HEAD>FDA Warns of Poison Ipecac Danger</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 3 grafs after 3rd graf pvs to UPDATE with comments

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of bottles of Humco
brand syrup of Ipecac, possibly containing a deadly poison, remain
in American homes, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.
   As many as 400,000 1-ounce bottles labeled Ipecac may actually
contain oil of eucalyptus, which could prove fatal if given to
children, the FDA said.
   Ipecac normally is used to induce vomiting in children who are
suspected of having eaten some dangerous product.
   Larry Copeland, general manager at Humco Laboratory Inc. in
Texarkana, Texas, said Friday evening that the FDA was overstating
the case by indicating that 400,000 bottles are at risk.
   ``We have sold close to 400,000 bottles since February of 1987,
but there was only one lot in which five bottles of eucalyptus oil
were mislabeled as Ipecac syrup,'' Copeland said in a telephone
interview. ``That's all that's been found and that's all that we're
aware of at this time.''
   Copeland, who identified that lot number is 2804, said the
company is recalling all lot numbers of the 1-ounce containers of
Ipecac syrup only ``to make everybody feel safer about it.''
   The FDA initially announced a recall of the Humco brand Ipecac
April 29, after the label mix-up was discovered. However, since
then it has learned that thousands of bottles of the product have
been distributed to consumers across the country as part of poison
prevention week activities.
   Finding and returning those bottles is vital, the FDA says, so
that parents will not forget and accidentally give some of the
eucalyptus oil to a child.
   Eucalyptus oil is used in minute amounts in vaporizers. But if
taken internally it can cause convulsions and coma, officials said.
As little as a teaspoonful could prove fatal, FDA reported.

   The owner of a boat service catering to
disabled and elderly people is battling federal officials who say
motorized craft aren't allowed in a popular wilderness recreation
area.
   ``I'm going to win because I have the law on my side,'' said
Dave Kromer, who owns and operates Dawn to Dusk Pontoon Services.
He says his motorized pontoon boat is the only way that the
handicapped would be able to see the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.
   Kromer, 39, took his 18-foot boat onto Fall Lake on Thursday and
intentionally crossed the line where the million-acre wilderness
area begins, setting up a legal battle over its use.
   The federally protected wilderness area on the Canadian border
is popular with canoeists and other aficionados of outdoor
recreation.
   When Kromer entered the area, U.S. Forest Service officials
tagged him with a citation requiring that he either pay a $100 fine
or go to court, in which case he faces a maximum fine of $500 and
six months in jail if he loses. Kromer said he will go to court
nonetheless.
   ``The seniors and the disabled have the right to visit this
area,'' Kromer said. ``The Forest Service is cutting down on that.
They're saying the disabled can't go in there if they're not
physically able. That's really sad.''
   But a U.S. Forest Service official said he believes few people
want Kromer's boat in the wilderness and that special provisions
shouldn't be made for the handicapped.
   ``We believe the law is very, very clear,'' said Jack Blackwell,
recreational staff officer for the U.S. Forest Service in Duluth.
``The handicapped do not get a special exemption. They are to take
the wilderness as it is.''
   ``Use of pontoon boats within the wilderness area is not an
acceptable form of transportation up there,'' Blackwell said.
   ``We don't feel any animosity toward Mr. Kromer. If he wants to
test us, that's fine and dandy. We believe that the overwhelming
majority of people here don't want to see pontoon boats up here.''
   While federal law allows only canoes and other paddle-only
watercraft on about 90 percent of the water in the wilderness area,
Fall and Basswood are part of a chain of lakes where certain
motorized watercraft are allowed.
   The law does not specifically list pontoon boats, though,
Blackwell said.
   Last summer, Kromer got to make 25 trips to the Basswood Lake
while his request for a permit to use the pontoon boat was pending.
   But the Forest Service eventually rejected the request, saying
the company's motorized pontoon boat is incompatible with the
surrounding wilderness and is bigger than most boats in the area.

   Joann Berte swears she was paralyzed by
three-fingered aliens and taken aboard their spaceship. Marianne
Shenefield, who claims to have twice encountered extraterrestrials,
said people who have seen them have an aura.
   Their stories are likely to be heard in dozens of variations
this weekend at a conference in Waltham expected to draw more than
250 UFO experts and people who claim to have been abducted by
extraterrestrials.
   ``I was immobilized. I couldn't move and I didn't think to
speak. I just watched,'' said Berte of a warm night on Dec. 10,
1979, when she says she was awakened on a friend's porch in Rhode
Island and carried in a paralyzed state aboard an alien spacecraft.
   Berte tells of observing a small, three-fingered alien in an
incubator and being brought to a glass-enclosed platform
overlooking a table where her friend lay with a tube extending from
her navel.
   ``It makes you very angry,'' said Berte. ``They don't ask your
permission. They just take you away.''
   Arthur Myers, a conference coordinator and member of a church
group interested in the paranormal, said the gathering is one of
the first public meetings of people claiming to have had close
encounters of the third kind.
   ``It reminds me a lot of alcholism or homosexuals coming out of
the closet,'' said Myers. ``There's a stigma attached to the
abductees. But once someone comes forward with their story, others
are willing to speak.''
   Marianne Shenefield of Agawam is one of those yearning to let
people know about her two experiences. Thirty-five years ago, she
was an 11-year-old girl building a tree house in Agawam on a July
afternoon.
   ``Then I turned around and there was what I thought was a little
boy in a scuba outfit,'' said Shenefield. ``Then I felt this
floating sensation and the next thing I knew I was in this round
craft.''
   Shenefield said the aliens put her under an X-ray device and she
was observed by several aliens, who tried to communicate with her
by a sound-making unit.
   In 1972, Shenefield said, a female-like alien captured her
outside her home and brought her into a small compartment.
Shenefield said she was released hours later, dazed but unharmed.
   A degenerative eye disorder has reduced her sight to dim shadows
and bold streaks of light. But the ailment enables her to see
auras, she said.
   ``I can immediately detect someone who has been abducted,'' she
said. ``They are surrounded by an indescribable color. Believe me,
I can tell.''
   Author Ray Fowler said about 80 percent of all UFO sightings can
be explained.
   ``But there are those instances that defy any explanation,''
said the former Air Force intelligence officer, a keynote speaker
at the conference Saturday.
   ``It's imperative that we study these things with an open mind,
not gullibly accept them or reject them out of hand. There are too

   The crew of a jumbo jet that landed Monday in
Japan with only one of four engines operating could have used a
backup system for correcting such failures, United Airlines said
Friday.
   Pending completion of an investigation by the airline and the
National Transportation Safety Board, the plane's cockpit crew has
been grounded in what United described as a routine action in such
cases.
   Flight 97, carrying 258 people from Los Angeles to Japan, landed
safety at Tokyo's Narita airport with three engines empty of fuel,
said United spokesman Rob Doughty.
   The fourth engine had 24,700 pounds of fuel, considerably more
than the federal landing requirement of 18,400 pounds on such
flights, he said.
   The Chicago-based carrier said it had completed tests on the
Boeing 747 and discovered that failure of a valve on one fuel tank
would have prevented the crew from using normal procedures to fuel
the engines, but found no mechanical problem with the backup system.
   ``The alternate method was tested, and there was no problem,''
Doughty said. ``There are always two parts of the investigation of
this type. First, the mechanical part, which we've concluded, and
secondly, the human part, which will now be looked into.''
   Air Line Pilots Association spokesman Hank Krakowski said, ``We
usually don't comment until the investigation is complete.''
   NTSB spokesman Allan Pollock also said he would not comment
while the investigation was under way.
   The pilot had reported losing power in the first engine over the
Pacific about 1 hour, 15 minutes from Tokyo, a second engine 30
minutes later and a third engine just before landing.

<TEXT>
   The wife of the black official
slain in the ``Sharpeville Six'' case died last month after her
release from a mental hospital, said a government statement issued
Friday.
   The statement regarding the death of councilor Jacob Dhlamini's
wife, Alice, appeared aimed at countering a wave of criticism of
South Africa that followed the conviction of the Sharpeville Six on
charges of complicity in Dhlamini's slaying. They were sentenced to
hang.
   There has been an international campaign appealing for clemency.
   The statement, attributed to ``concerned residents,'' said Mrs.
Dhlamini became unstable after the 1984 killing and was placed in a
mental hospital in June 1987. She was released several weeks later
and died in April, it said, leaving behind three children ``who
once had a bright future in a happy and talented parental home.''
   The Bureau for Information said the statement was written by
local officials and based on remarks by elderly residents of
Sharpeville, the black township where Dhlamini was killed by a mob
during riots in 1984.
   The executions of the Sharpeville Six _ five men and a woman _
have been stayed while defense lawyers apply to reopen the trial to
consider claims that a state witness was coerced by police.
   The six were not accused of contributing physically to
Dhlamini's death. They were convicted under the doctrine of
``common purpose,'' which holds them responsible because they were
part of the mob.
   The government has argued the Sharpeville Six are being
misrepresented abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law.
Authorities say evidence at the trial showed each contributed to
the killing through such alleged actions as making firebombs to
burn Dhlamini's house and slapping a woman who pleaded for his life.
   Dlhamini's brother, Sello, has been threatened by people
demanding that he sign a statement asking that the Sharpeville Six
not be hanged, the statement said.
   The statement also described Jacob Dhlamini as having an
``absolute sense of justice'' and said he had tried to resolve
grievances over the rent increases that triggered the 1984 riots.

   A Superior Court judge Friday refused a
two-week delay of former Gov. Evan Mecham's May 19 trial on charges
of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Defense attorney Michael Scott had asked Judge Michael D. Ryan
for the delay to give him more time to prepare and to allow an
appeals court to rule on a request for a dismissal of the charges
on grounds of selective prosecution.
   Scott has argued that Gov. Rose Mofford and former School
Superintendent Carolyn Warner, Mecham's Democratic opponent in
1986, had made similar omissions from their financial disclosure
statements and had not been charged.
   Assistant Attorney General Barnett Lotstein said that both women
are under investigation, and he opposed any delay.
   Mecham, 63, was removed by the Senate in an impeachment trial
last month. He was convicted of misusing $80,000 and trying to
thwart an investigation of a death threat.

   In the first public airing of its views on a provisional regime

   The possibility of such a provisional government has been

agreement envisions the return of millions of Afghan refugees and
the establishment of an independent government.

the public by asserting a study showed the new 65 mph speed limit
had no discernible effect on the traffic death rate, a former

   ``I think that Burnley is just trying to make a political case

contradict his position, and he's trying to maneuver the
statistics,'' said Joan Claybrook, who headed the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration under President Carter.
   Ms. Claybrook now is president of Public Citizen, a policy group
often critical of the Reagan administration.
   ``It is totally absurd but expected from Joan Claybrook,'' said
Transportation Department spokesman Ron DeFore. ``Joan has
consistently been a critic of NHTSA under this administration, and
this study, this interim report, does not support her point of
view.''
   The department, in a report presented to Congress on Friday,
said raw data showed only a 1 percentage point difference in
traffic fatality increases on rural interstate highways having the
higher speed limit and those retaining the 55 mph national speed
limit adopted in 1974.

hostages were freed in Lebanon and New Caledonia and the candidates
ended their campaigns.
   President Francois Mitterrand, 71, a Socialist seeking a second
seven-year term, remained the favorite in Sunday's runoff against
55-year-old conservative Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Still, Chirac was expected to benefit from the release Wednesday

conservatives and moderates launched intensive drives to set the
vice president's ideological compass in advance of the fall
campaign.
   Conservatives drew up their short list of acceptable running

   But while the right has been most vocal in pressuring the vice
president, GOP moderates also are bombarding him with arguments as
to why he should shift to the left.
   ``The vice president accedes to the right at the risk of his own

older jetliners, but the problem has been known for years.
   Nearly a decade ago, the industry and its regulators agreed to

already approaching old age. A program begun in 1983 covers nearly

<TEXT>
   For Berlin Philharmonic fans, legendary conductor
Herbert von Karajan may have called in sick once too often.
   The orchestra's ``conductor for life'' said he had an intestinal
flu and couldn't conduct a heavily advertised Berlin concert on
April 24.
   A day later, he flew off to Japan for a 10-day tour with the
orchestra, raising cries of protest, sparking letters to the editor
and infuriating West Berlin officials who help bankroll the famed
musicians.
   Leading the charge against the 80-year-old maestro was city
culture affairs chief Volker Hassemer, who vowed to probe the
incident.
   Gerhard Heldt, orchestra spokesman, declined comment on the
dispute, adding that there would be nothing to say until after the
orchestra returns from Japan.
   As for obtaining comment from Karajan, Heldt said in a telephone
interview, ``You can say it is impossible to reach him now.''
   Starting in the fall of 1986, a severe viral infection kept
Karajan off the Berlin Philharmonic podium for four months, and
also forced him to stay home when the orchestra toured the United
States and Japan.
   Karajan has suffered many medical problems in recent years,
including severe back pains that have forced him to cancel
conducting appearances.
   However, Michael Dieterici, a spokesman for the city's culture
affairs chief, said Karajan also had called off appearances with
the Berlin Philharmonic two or three times in the past under
questionable circumstances.
   He noted, for example, that during a tour of West Germany last
November Karajan announced he couldn't mount the podium in
Duesseldorf because he said he had food poisoning from eating
tainted fish. Karajan later changed his mind and performed, but
called off his appearance in Stuttgart during the same tour.
   Dieterici said officials plan to discuss the matter with Karajan.
   ``We want to point out to him that there is a contract calling
for a certain number of concerts each year,'' Dieterici said in an
interview. ``We want to make sure that he sticks to that contract,
as much as his health allows.''
   Dieterici says the Berlin contract calls for Karajan to conduct
about a dozen concerts a year.
   The West Berlin city administration gives the Berlin
Philharmonic $25 million a year in subsidies for its various
activities. However, Dieterici said he didn't know how much goes
directly to Karajan.
   Both Der Spiegel magazine of Hamburg and Berlin's Tagespiegel
newspaper recently have carried lengthy reports about enormous sums
of money Karajan's agents allegedly demanded last year for a
concert tour to Taiwan. The Taiwanese later withdrew the idea,
reportedly because of the money involved.
   Berlin's leftist-leaning TAZ newspaper said recently: ``Karajan
loves the Japanese. They gladly buy up his CDs (compact discs) and
his music videos.
   ``But the Berliners also love Herbert. They don't always want to
drive to Salzburg for him,'' the newspaper added. Karajan is also
renowned for the annual summer musical festival he leads in
Salzburg, Austria.
   The April 24 concert opened the city's turn at being the
European Culture City of the year.

   ``And we are going forward with research on a new Orient Express
that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles

   The idea has a nice ring to
it: Tokyo in two hours. Zooming over the Earth at 25 times the
speed of sound. Crossing the Pacific in an airplane so
revolutionary the space shuttle and the Concorde become old hat.
   Third millenium, here we come.
   That airplane, or something like it, is taking shape at this and
other NASA centers in bits and pieces: a model is assaulted in a
wind tunnel by 4,800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degrees
below zero; an electron beam illuminates air flow around a
scaled-down plane; a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough
3,000-feet long, sensitive to every nuance of resistance; a
photograph captures shock wave and heat patterns in ghostly hues of
green, orange, yellow, blue and magenta; the most powerful computer
ever built ingests world-class problems and spits out answers; a
standard airplane circles over Chesapeake Bay, piloted not from the
standard cockpit in front, but from a second, all-electronic one,
in its passenger section.
   The ``Little A'' in NASA _ the aeronautics part of National
Aeronautics and Space Administration _ is not as flashy as the
``Big S'' and gets only 7 percent of the agency's budget, but its
accomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways.
   A poultry plant in Marietta, Ga., is quieter because of NASA
aeronautics; water quality in many places is improved because of
aeronautics technology; firemen wear better protective clothing.
   ``We are called the space agency by many, probably including
yourself,'' Jeremiah F. Creedon, the director for flight systems at
the Langley Research Center, tells a visitor, a bit of resignation
in his voice. ``Many of us here think the A is a large one.''
   Langley's work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics, 40
percent space, with a hefty dose of military work in both. With
other NASA research centers _ Ames and Dryden in California and
Lewis in Ohio _ its business is to develop technology and pass it
on, without cost, to aircraft companies. The federal government has
played that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago.
   The agency has never built an airplane, but few planes fly today
without engines, designs, materials and structures conceived at
NASA. ``We are doing research that benefits the country,'' says
Creedon. ``It is available to Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell
Douglas, whoever wants to build transport or high performance
aircraft.'' No single company alone could afford NASA's $2 billion
investment in wind tunnels.
   Here at Langley, they don't talk about the ``Orient Express.''
It's either the NASP, the National Aerospace Plane, or better yet
the X-30, next in a string of experimental planes that began with
Chuck Yeager's X-1, breaker of the sound barrier.
   When President Reagan made his rosy prediction about the Orient
Express, a week after the Challenger space shuttle disaster,
engineers had already taken years to decide the X-30 was possible.
Reagan's one paragraph announcement signaled the start of Phase 2,
perfecting the technology, which will last until the summer of
1990, when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand and
decide whether to build the X-30. Phase 3, in the mid-90s, would
see the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the
21st century begins.
   That's the timetable for the largest experimental aircraft
project ever undertaken by the United States. It will cost $3.3
billion. Clearly NASA and the Air Force, which is sharing the cost,
have something more practical in mind than building one or two
prototype planes, merely to prove it can be done.
   The military and package-delivery firms such as Federal Express
and UPS are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25
times the speed of sound _ fast enough to get into orbit. But the
aerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slower
but far more useful aircraft of the future.

   Comics impresario Stan Lee says the secret of
transferring a character from comic book to television successfully
is to avoid making the show a carbon copy.
   Lee transformed Marvel Comics into a publishing phenomenon 20
years ago and made ``Spider-Man,'' ``The Fantastic Four'' and ``The
Incredible Hulk'' as popular on college campuses as ``Lord of the
Flies,'' ``A Separate Peace'' and ``Catcher in the Rye.''
   As editor, art director and head writer, he wrote at least two
and sometimes five comic books a week for 25 years. He now writes
the ``Spider-Man'' newspaper comic strip.
   ``The Incredible Hulk'' was a popular series on CBS from 1978 to
1982. It won three Emmy awards and inspired a Saturday morning
animated series that ran on NBC from 1982 to 1985.
   It comes back Sunday, May 22, in a special movie for NBC, ``The
Incredible Hulk Returns.'' Lou Ferrigno and Bill Bixby return in
their roles as the Hulk and as David Banner, the Hulk's alter ego.
Joining them are Eric Kramer as Thor and Steve Levitt as Dr. Donald
Blake.
   ``When `Spider-Man' started in the newspapers, you had
`Superman' and `Star Trek' and `Star Wars,''' said Lee. ``Now
`Spider-Man' is in 500 papers and the others are gone. You have to
realize that each medium has its own style. So what I did with
`Spider-Man' was make it more like `Mary Worth.'
   ``The trouble when people try to bring comic book characters to
television or the movies is that they try to do it exactly as the
original. When we brought the `Hulk' to television we changed it.
In the comics he could talk a little. On TV he doesn't talk at all.
In the comics Thor is a doctor who can change into the God of
Thunder. We can put a thought balloon over his head. But in the
movie he's two separate characters. That way they can talk to each
other and move the story along.''
   ``Spider-Man'' failed as a television series. ``It was
terrible,'' said Lee. ``They didn't understand what Spider-Man was
supposed to be. I was a consultant. I learned that being a
consultant means you give your opinion but nobody listens to you.''
   ``The Amazing Spider-Man'' and ``The Incredible Hulk'' were on
the air in a period when television was enamored of comic book-type
superheroes. Other shows included ``The Greatest American Hero,''
``The New Adventures of Wonder Woman,'' ``Buck Rogers in the 25th
Century,'' ``The Six-Million Dollar Man'' and ``The Bionic Woman.''
   Lee moved from New York to Los Angeles 10 years ago, when Marvel
began licensing its comic characters for animated series.
   ``I write at home,'' he said. ``I can't write at the office.
When I started writing all the books, I asked for Wednesdays off to
stay home and write. Then I asked for Tuesdays and Thursdays. It
finally ended up with me going to the office two days a week and
writing at home the rest of the week. Here, I take off Wednesdays
to stay home and write the `Spider-Man' newspaper strip.''
   Asked why the Hulk is popular, Lee said, ``No matter how
powerful we are, or how competent we are, we always wish we were
more so. There are things in life that frustrate us. When Banner
becomes angry he turns into this character of raw strength and
power. He can overcome things that upset him. I think we all have
that fantasy.
   ``When he's the Hulk he's not very bright. We're glad to see
someone that powerful isn't too smart.''
   He laughed. ``It's funny how you get all the theories after the
fact. When I created the series, I was thinking of a Frankenstein's
monster. A good guy who's misunderstood. Then I thought of `Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.' I told artist Jack Kirby, `Let's make a hero
out of a monster.''
   Lee, who joined Marvel Comics when he was 16, said,
``Superheroes aren't a tough sell. People love fantasies. Look at
`King Solomon's Mines' or Robin Hood. The trouble is most people
don't know how to do fantasy. They either make it too silly, and
adults won't accept it, or they make it too dull.
   ``You have to walk a fine line. You have to be realistic and
believable. Then people will accept something fantastic. `The
Incredible Hulk' asks you to believe that a man can turn into
another creature. Everything else is very real.''

<HEAD>Program Trading Debate Intensifies, Some Say Legislation
Inevitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a typical post-crash day on Wall Street,
a slow, nervous market, when suddenly the demand for big-name
stocks jumped and started an apparent rally. Just as abruptly,
prices tumbled and the Dow Jones industrial average ended the
session with a loss.
   At Integrated Resources Asset Management, a firm that manages $5
billion in investment money, executives knew the telephone calls
would be coming in from irate clients demanding to know why the
market had seesawed for no apparent reason. The executives also
knew how they would answer: computerized program trading done by a
few big brokerages.
   ``It's just a horrendous negative for public confidence. The
public has had it with this, bottom line,'' said Harvey Eisen,
president of the firm. ``This stuff is just nonsense. It's like a
casino.''
   Eisen's anger reflects a deepening resentment among many Wall
Street professionals over what they see as the profoundly
destructive effects of program trading, a strategy for selling and
buying massive amounts of stocks instantaneously through the use of
high-speed computer systems.
   It has been widely blamed for injecting volatility into the
stock market, frightening millions of ordinary investors and
contributing to a malaise that has afflicted the securities
business since the crash nearly seven months ago.
   ``My view is that individuals feel it's a big negative for the
market and has driven some people out of the market,'' said John
Markese, vice president and research director for the American
Association of Individual Investors, a Chicago-based group.
   The New York Stock Exchange has attempted to limit the effects
of program trading since the crash by restricting the use of its
computers for the technique when the Dow average swings more than
50 points in one day.
   Nevertheless, program trading still is considered a powerful
influence, partly because it remains profitable in an otherwise
bleak market and because there are ways to sidestep the NYSE
limitations.
   Some brokers say program trading has become an even more potent
force since the crash, because its volatile side-effects are
magnified by an overall decline in trading volume.
   Clearly worried about the long-term implications, NYSE officials
this past week took an additional step to constrict program
trading, by requiring member firms to submit daily logs of all
program trades they have executed.
   The Big Board's move received a mixed reaction. Some critics of
program trading said it might take federal legislation to ban the
technique and restore market confidence.
   ``When you start destroying people's basic wealth because of
some trading scheme or gambling scheme, it obviously causes bitter
resentments,'' said David Johnson, president of Johnson, Lane,
Space, Smith & Co., a regional brokerage in Savannah, Ga. ``If
something isn't done, you'll find a political movement for it. I
think we're going to start seeing that.''
   The most commonly criticized form of program trading is index
arbitrage, a method for selling stocks in New York and buying
stock-index futures contracts in Chicago, or vice versa, to profit
from price disparities.
   Critics contend the strategy is based on mathematics that have
no relation to economic fundamentals. Moreover, they say it
involves little risk because of the relatively low margins, or down
payments, needed to trade index futures.
   Defenders say program trading has been unfairly singled out as a
disruptive force. On the contrary, they contend it helps stabilize
the market by keeping the price of stocks and stock-index futures
from varying too widely.
   ``I think too much blame has been placed on program trading,''
said Daniel Siegel, a business professor who teaches futures and
options at Northwestern University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School
of Management.
   ``I don't see anyone complaining that interest rates are to
blame. Interest rates have been very volatile,'' Siegel said. ``The
New York Stock Exchange frankly is looking for a scapegoat.''
   Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp., a New
York firm that utilizes program trading, said he welcomed the
latest NYSE requirement because it will show that the strategy's
influence is extremely limited. ``This will nail it down,'' he said.
   The most significant program traders, however, are highly
sensitive to the criticism and have declined to talk to the press
about it. Executives at Salomon Brothers Inc. and Kidder Peabody &
Co., considered among the biggest users of the technique, did not
return telephone calls for comment.
   Whatever the prognosis for program trading, some securities
professionals say an outright ban would only hurt their business in
the long run by driving customers to less restrictive markets
overseas.
   ``The strength of our capital markets and derivative securities
attract capital to this country, to the point where many countries
are working on mimicking our capability,'' said Kelly Haughton,
senior vice president of Frank Russell & Co., a Tacoma, Wash.-based
investment consulting firm.

   More likely than an outright ban are stricter regulations on the
use of program trading, imposed either by the securities markets
themselves or the government, traders say.
   Among the possibilities are much higher margin requirements for
trading stock-index futures. Another is a stricter limit on the
sale of a stock when its price is falling, which could prevent the
simultaneous buying and selling of stocks and index futures crucial
to the program trading strategy.
   ``You take the profitability out of it and it won't happen any
more,'' said Johnson.

<HEAD>To Discount or Not To Discount</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Implicit in arguments upholding a manufacturer's
right to deny discount retailers access to its products is the
concept of service, a promise built into the price of most hardware
sold today.
   The notion of service was inherent in a recent Supreme Court
decision upholding a manufacturer's right to pick its retailers. It
is forever promised by manufacturers. Retailers advertise that it
comes with a smile.
   But does it?
   Surveys made ever since the 1960s show service to be the most
elusive of quests, the lack of it a source of continued gripes, and
the promise of it continually ignored or unfulfilled.
   In concept, at least, retailers who charge full price also incur
the expense of servicing the product. Their relationship with the
customer is viewed as a continuing one that might involve repairs
or replacement.
   In contrast, the assumption is made that the discounter is able
to sell at a lower price because it offers little service. The
relationship is considered closed at the time of sale. For service,
the customer goes elsewhere.
   But if the service isn't forthcoming, how can the higher price
of the full-price retailer be justified? If the promised service
isn't delivered, doesn't the agreement to maintain higher prices
simply become price-fixing?
   While the Supreme Court sought to cut through the issue _
declaring that a manufacturer's denial of access to a discounter
isn't automatically illegal unless accompanied by an effort to fix
retail prices _ it probably didn't.
   There need not be a specific price published or even mentioned
for a price-fixing deal to be accomplished. That end can be
produced automatically simply by choosing as outlets the retail
establishments that charge higher prices.
   But the issue isn't a simple one either.
   Manufacturers spend great sums developing and promoting their
products and winning the confidence of consumers. Understandably,
they dislike the idea of any retailer trashing their good name by
irritating customers.
   Moreover, their understanding with retailers assumes their
fortunes are entertwined and dependent on each other. The retailer
wants advertising support from the manufacturer; the latter expects
the retailer to live up to the ads.
   But it doesn't always work that way, or if it does, much of
America isn't convinced of it. Surveys repeatedly show that poor
service or the lack of it is one of the major consumer complaints
of our age.
   Many believe the difference between the discounter's price and
that of the full-price dealer cannot be measured in service. Some
suspect the higher price merely supports the heavier advertising
and promotional costs.
   An even larger issue is presented by the increasing complexity
of products that simply cannot be sold without service. In this
instance, service means not just repairs but, as with computers,
education in the use of the product.
   But that presents another tricky matter: Why should the
individual without need of education, and without any intention of
applying for it, have to pay the full price?
   There are economic consequences, too, one being the possible
inflationary impact. Isn't competitive pricing the very essence of
free enterprise? Isn't needlessly high pricing the route to
competitive failure?
   But the biggest question of all is one that has been asked over
and over since the word ``consumer,'' as opposed to ``customer,''
became popular back in the 1960s:
   In a society that produces more services than manufactured
goods, and which is forever promising to deliver service with a
smile, whatever has happened to the good old-fashioned notion of
making every customer a satisfied one?

<HEAD>Fears of Gold Crash Offset By Market's Trendless Showing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with add containing week's
price trends.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

   An authoritative forecast for growing supplies and slack demand
has many experts turning bearish on gold. But others say the gold
market's jaded reaction to recent economic indicators casts a cloud
over any long-range predictions.
   A new report _ ``Gold Crash: Risk or Reality?'' _ from the
respected Wefa Group and metals-and-mining consultant Resource
Strategies Inc. lays out the case for sharply lower gold prices.
   The researchers said steadily rising mine production and weak
investor demand will force prices down from current levels of
around $450 a troy ounce to $300 or $350 by the early 1990s and as
low as $250 a troy ounce within five years.
   ``Investors and portfolio managers should not have long
positions in gold at this time,'' the study warns.
   Chicago-based GNP Commodities is also forecasting a sharp drop
in gold prices, beginning next year, to as low as $350 a troy ounce.
   Critics of the Wefa report point out that gold prices have
traditionally responded more to economic factors _ especially
inflation fears _ than to supply factors. But even some of those
analysts foresee sharply lower gold prices.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser for New York-based
Josephthal & Co., predicts a rapid decline in gold prices to under
$400 a troy ounce within the next month.
   Cardillo said he disagreed with the Wefa group's reasoning and
based his forecast on gold's high price relative to crude oil.
   He said a troy ounce of gold on New York's Commodity Exchange
traditionally costs about 18 times the price of a barrel of West
Texas Intermediate crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   He said he expected crude oil prices to average $20 a barrel
over the next two years. Using Cardillo's simple rule of thumb,
that would put gold at $360 a troy ounce.
   At the current price near $450, ``gold is somewhat overpriced,''
Cardillo said.
   He said the inflated gold price stemmed from overdone fears of
inflation.
   ``I think we will have an uptick in inflation but certainly not
anything to worry about,'' he said. ``I don't think we're headed
for a runaway inflation.''
   Inflation is the main engine of the gold market because gold
tends to hold its value during inflationary times.
   The Wefa group took the gold market's reluctance to rally on
recent inflationary indicators as a signal that investor enthusiasm
for gold is not as strong as it used to be.
   That may be true _ many analysts have noted a drop in investor
activity in all the financial markets since the stock market's
plunge in October.
   But gold prices also have refused to fall very far on
deflationary signals, making it difficult to mke any prediction
about future price movement, said David Syphen, vice president of
metals and foreign exchange trading for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   Gold has traded within a range of $440 to $460 a troy ounce
since February.
   ``We seem to have a high degree of stability to the market right
now,'' Syphen said. ``It's just maintaining equilibrium for the
time being.''
   Reduced investor participation has left the gold market thin and
listless, and it could remain that way for some time, said Bette
Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``What I see is not a sharp decline nor a sharp move to the
upside, but rather buying at any lows, and some producer selling
when you get to the higher levels,'' she said.

<HEAD>New Jobless Figures Could Cast Shadow Over Treasury Refunding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No sooner did the edgy bond market get a dose of
good news this past week about the government's borrowing plans
than it got cold water splashed in its face by a new report on U.S.
unemployment.
   And analysts say the jobless data for April, which were widely
interpreted as showing underlying strength in the economy, could
cast a wide shadow over the Treasury's quarterly refunding in the
coming week by keeping bond prices depressed. The government plans
to sell $26 billion in new debt at three days of auctions for the
second quarter, and bond investors are looking ahead anxiously to
the sales.
   ``I don't like the prospects for the refunding following the
release of these (unemployment) data,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist and senior vice president of the fixed-income division at
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   The Treasury announced Wednesday its plans for auctioning the
$26 billion in debt, which is down 3.7 percent from the refunding
auction in the first quarter. The reduction in public borrowing
cheered the bond market, since it means less downward pressure on
bond prices.
   Friday's unemployment report, however, was bad news for bond
prices and propelled interest rates higher.
   The Labor Department said the nation's jobless rate fell to 5.4
percent in April, the lowest since June 1974. A separate survey of
business payrolls showed a gain of 175,000 jobs, more than
one-fourth of them on factory assembly lines in industries that
have increased their exports in recent months.
   The economic robustness portrayed by the figures rekindled fears
that inflation could pick up, possibly spurring the Federal Reserve
to tighten interest rates in a bid to rein in growth.
   The price of the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond tumbled
7-16 point Friday, or $4.38 for every $1,000 in face value. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, jumped
to 9.13 percent from 9.09 percent late Thursday.
   The unemployment report ``does nothing to allay the market's
concerns about a buildup in inflationary pressures,'' said William
Sullivan, director of money-market research for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``It all points toward higher yields.''
   The bond market is fearful that investors _ especially the
Japanese _ could shy away from the Treasury auctions if they smell
a trend toward higher interest rates in the air. Japanese investors
are traditionally big buyers of U.S. government securities.
   A poor showing at the auctions of new government securities
would tend to depress prices of existing bonds. That is why some
analysts are viewing the sales as ``acid tests'' of bond supply
that could be difficult to digest.
   The Treasury plans to sell $8.75 billion in new three-year notes
on Tuesday, another $8.75 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and
$8.50 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   The $26 billion to be raised includes $9.5 billion in new cash
and $16.5 billion to pay off maturing debt.

<TEXT>
   The echoes of the stock-market crash have given
way to an uneasy silence on Wall Street.
   It seems, traders and analysts say, as though just about
everybody who wanted to get out of stocks after the collapse of the
1982-87 bull market has already done so.
   At the same time, they add, hardly anyone is ready to buy except
for a quick trade or in some ``gimmick'' transaction involving a
dividend payment or a takeover rumor.
   To the casual observer, it may look as though a sense of calm
and order has been restored to a marketplace that was badly shaken
up not so long ago.
   But it is hardly a welcome development to professionals in the
business who find themselves with time on their hands and, in a
good many cases, wondering and worrying about the future of their
jobs.
   As unhappy as they may be about the situation, many market
participants say they can readily understand it.
   ``It is not surprising investors are reluctant to take a stand
at this current juncture,'' said Joanne Hill, a vice president who
specializes in financial futures at Kidder, Peabody & Co.
   ``Recent economic developments with respect to the deficit,
dollar and interest rate environment have given little cause for
enthusiasm. However, there is also little conviction for further
reducing equity exposures that for many institutions are already at
the end of their typical ranges.
   ``This dilemma produces a stalemate in which the market is left
to draw its order flow from takeover and dividend-capture plays and
from short-term traders.''
   Assuming this condition won't persist indefinitely, the natural
question arises: Is it the calm before another storm, or a
``breather'' during which confidence in stocks can gradually be
restored?
   In times like this, analysts often cite a long-standing
investment maxim: ``Never sell a dull market short.'' But Edward
Nicoski at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. says he is not so sure
that applies right now.
   ``We're not recommending aggressive short selling, a wholesale
bailout of equities or anything of the sort,'' Nicoski said in a
recent commentary.
   ``But we're darn right uncomfortable. The aggressive desire to
own `real' stocks just is not there.''
   It was notably absent in the past week, as the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials slumped 24.87 to 2,007.46.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 2.45 to
145.88; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
edged up .18 to 379.42; and the American Stock Exchange market
value index lost 1.33 to 301.81.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 151.13 million shares a day,
against 141.47 million the week before.
   The general view of the economic outlook on the Street fits
right in with the subdued mood in the markets:
   The Federal Reserve may soon feel compelled to tighten credit to
combat increasing inflationary pressures. But if it is going to
keep inflation in check, it may be forced to slow the economy to
the point where the outlook for corporate profits worsens
significantly.
   Some optimists, however, say that kind of thinking is misguided.
``We think we are in a period of slow growth _ neither a recession
nor an inflation-triggering boom,'' said William LeFevre at Advest

<HEAD>Irving, Bank Of NY Both Optimistic About Proxy Battle Results</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>

   The seven-month cliffhanger for control of
Irving Bank Corp. has reached a climax, with both Irving and its
hostile suitor, Bank of New York Co., hinting at victory.
   But the final results of the shareholder vote completed at
Irving's annual meeting Friday won't be known until later this
month.
   Irving stockowners had to choose between a slate of 16 incumbent
directors that back a restructuring and friendly merger with Banca
Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second-largest bank, and nominees
from rival Bank of New York.
   Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice, wearing a ``V for Victory'' pin
on his lapel, said Friday that he was optimistic about the vote.
``Why shouldn't I say we have this wrapped?'' he told a news
conference.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady also said, ``We are very
optimistic.''
   Although the results are not expected to be released before a
reconvened meeting May 24, both sides said they were confident
based on preliminary proxy counts and conversations with
institutional investors, which hold about two-thirds of Irving's
18.5 million common shares outstanding.
   Irving spokesman David Santos said early counts showed about
half of the 20 million voting shares, which included preferred
stock, were in favor of Irving's board. But he cautioned that it
was possible a number of those shares also were sent in duplicate
to Bank of New York.
   Banking analysts generally have given Bank of New York an edge
in the proxy battle, mostly because it already has secured the
necessary regulatory approvals from the Federal Reserve and New
York State Banking boards. Banca Commerciale, which is controlled
by the government agency Instituto per la Recostruzione
Industriale, has just begun the lengthy regulatory review process.
   Bank of New York, which owns a nearly 5 percent stake in Irving,
is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of
Irving's common shares. The offer is valued at about $63 a share or
$1.08 billion.
   Earlier this week, the company said that it held about 59
percent of Irving's common shares, including its own stake and
shares tendered to it. The bid expired on Friday, but Brady said
the company may decide to extend it on Monday.
   Banca Commerciale is offering $75 a share for 9.5 million Irving
shares, or about 51 percent, valued at $707 million. In addition,
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price
from May 31 until the deal closes.
   The Banca Commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring
plan that includes asset sales such as Irving's 50-story Wall
Street headquarters, cost-cutting measures and a $10-a-share
special cash dividend. Irving said the offer has a blended value of
between $65.20 and $72.55 a share.
   Irving shares fell 37.5 cents to $60, while Bank of New York
rose 12.5 cents to $30.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.
   Some of the approximately 1,200 shareholders that packed the
annual meeting Friday expressed mixed feelings about either offer,
and many said they were angered that Irving had not obtained a
better deal.
   ``There's no question in my mind that the Bank of New York is
trying to steal your bank,'' said Robert Strougo, a New York
attorney representing 1,600 voting shares. ``There's no reason why
this bank couldn't be sold for in excess of $100 a share.''
   Bank of New York offered Irving a cash-and-stock deal valued at
around $1.4 billion when it first made its rare hostile bid seven
months ago, but it lowered its offer twice following the Oct. 19
stock market crash.
   Irving has staunchly resisted Bank of New York's advances. Among
its many defenses was to activate its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
defense, which is intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively
expensive.
   Rice said representatives from his bank and the Bank of New York
met as recently as two weeks ago but had no plans to resume talks.
In the meantime, he said, the company would continue to welcome
offers from other potential suitors.
   ``We are in discussion with anyone who will talk with us,'' he
told reporters. ``We're willing to consider the best proposition
from anybody ... (because) we are dealing with a situation that was
thrust upon us.''

<HEAD>Prices Rise, Crude Up 35 Cents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Oil prices have risen in reaction to an expected
rise in demand and fears of a U.S. supply squeeze caused by a major
refinery fire.
   The rise on Friday was magnified by short-covering, a
price-boosting occurrence caused by traders who repurchase borrowed
oil they had sold earlier on the hunch that prices would fall.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 35 cents per 42-gallon barrel to
close at $17.74.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline rose .91 cent a gallon to 51.52 cents, and
wholesale heating oil rose .85 cent a gallon to 47.42 cents.
   Traders said predictions of a rising demand for petroleum,
caused partly by the impending summer driving season and a growing
domestic economy, was one reason for the rise in prices.
   They also said an explosion at a Shell Oil Co. refinery in
Norco, La., which helped boost prices Thursday, continued to buoy
the market Friday. Although the facility produces a miniscule
fraction of total consumption, some traders said the explosion
could disrupt the flow of supplies from the Gulf Coast.
   As with most one-day price moves, no trend emerged for the oil
market, which has been volatile largely because of failed efforts
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrict
output and stabilize prices.

<HEAD>Unemployment Slips, Consumer Debt Rises, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market lost ground for the week, ending with its third
consecutive daily loss as traders worried that the strength evident
in the April unemployment report could lead to higher interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.77 points on
Friday to close at 2,007.46, bringing its loss for the week to
24.87 points.
   Before trading opened, the government said the unemployment rate
fell to 5.4 percent in April. Later in the day, it reported
consumer installment debt grew by $4.46 billion in March.
   The drop in the unemployment rate, down from 5.6 percent in
March, left it at the lowest level since June 1974.
   The number of Americans at work rose by 606,000 last month while
those listed as unemployed fell by 191,000 to 6.6 million, the
Labor Department said.
   It said the average hourly wage nationwide in April rose a
nickel to $9.22 for an average annual increase of 5.6 percent.
   Some private analysts said the tighter labor market is bound to
push wages up soon and exert inflationary pressures on prices as
well.
   Donald Ratajczak, head of the Georgia State University Economic
Forecasting Project, said ``606,000 new jobs is far above what
anyone expected.''
   ``At other times, we would be happy about that kind of decrease
in unemployment, but at this stage in the cycles, we are nervous.
It may be too strong for the economy,'' Ratajczak said at a meeting
in Atlanta.
   But other economists said the wage gains are still not big
enough to trigger a tightening of credit by the Federal Reserve
Board through higher interest rates in an effort to cool off the
economy.
   ``The fears of an inflationary boom are overstated,'' said
Lawrence Chimerine, president of the Wefa Group of Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., an economic consulting firm.
   In the report on consumer credit, the Federal Reserve Board said
consumer installment debt grew by $4.46 billion in March, a strong
annual rate of growth of 8.6 percent.
   The Fed said consumer debt grew a 10.3 percent annual rate for
the first three months of the year, compared with 7.2 percent for
all of 1987.
   Seprately, a business information group reportyed that
businesses placed slightly more help-wanted advertisements in March
than they did in February.
   The Conference Board said its seasonally adjusted Help Wanted
Advertising Index rose 3 points in March to 159. The index measures
the volume of classified advertising in 51 major newspapers around
the nation.

   Allied Stores Corp. President Robert H. Morosky,
who was expected to become chairman of Federated Department Stores
Inc. after its merger with Campeau Corp., has agreed to resign,
Campeau said in a surprise announcement.
   Campeau said late Friday its chairman, Robert Campeau, would
serve as chairman of both Allied and Federated for the foreseeable
future.
   The statement said Robert Campeau would hold both positions ``in
light of the size and importance to Campeau Corp. of its
acquisition of Federated.''
   However, the suddenness of the announcement raised the question
of a dispute between the two men.
   Morosky was not at home when a reporter called for comment late
Friday.
   It has been widely assumed the Morosky would be named chairman
of Federated and Allied. At a news conference last month, several
days after Robert Campeau won a two-month-long takeover battle for
Federated, he introduced Morosky as the ``president and chief
executive of Federated.''
   Both men talked then about their plans for Federated, and
Morosky has visited Federated's headquarters and divisions.
   The statement from the Toronto-based Campeau said Robert Campeau
and Morosky were discussing the possibility of Morosky's remaining
a consultant on distribution, expansion and overseas office.
   Those areas have been Morosky's strong suit. Before being hired
by Campeau last November, he had spent 15 years at Limited Inc.,
the apparel retailer. As Limited's vice chairman, Morosky, 46,
developed the distribution and inventory system that helped that
company's rapid expansion.
   He left Limited in the summer of 1987, reportedly because of a
dispute with company chairman, Leslie Wexner.
   During Campeau's battle with R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. for Federated,
many Wall Street analysts, looking back at Morosky's tenure at
Limited, said they feared he would transform Federated's diverse
divisions into a group of look-alike stores.
   The Campeau Corp. statement said Robert Campeau expected to name
a new chief executive officer for Federated and Allied within 30
days.
   Control of Federated passed to Campeau earlier this week when
the Canadian developer announced it had accepted more than 87
million shares tendered by the retailer's stockholders.
   The merger between Federated and Campeau is expected to be
completed in about a month.
   Several Federated divisions have been sold to finance the
Campeau acquisition, and others are expected to go on the block.
Campeau is retaining the Bloomingdale's, Lazarus, Burdine's,
Abraham & Straus, Rich's and Goldsmith's department store divisions
and Ralphs supermarkets.
   Allied Stores, which Campeau took over in 1986, now comprises
Stern's, Ann Taylor, Maas Brothers and Jordan Marsh and Bon stores.
Most of Allied's store divisions also have been sold.
