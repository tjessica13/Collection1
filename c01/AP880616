<BYLINE>Opposition Leader Balks At Decree On Islamic Law</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto
assailed President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq for his decree making Islam
the law of the land and accusing him of doing it to stay in power,
newspapers reported Thursday.
   Zia put the so-called Shariah Law into effect Wednesday night in
a televised address to the nation. He said his decree makes Islam
``the supreme law of Pakistan'' but will not affect the rights of
non-Moslems or Pakistan's business contracts with other nations.
   The official Pakistan Times newspaper trumpeted ``Shariat At
Last'' on page one. A report in the English-language Daily Muslim,
however, quoted Ms. Bhutto as telling Pakistani journalists at a
Wednesday reception that her archfoe Zia had ``no right to impose
his will on the people of Pakistan.''
   Other newspapers carried similar accounts.
   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, was quoted as
saying:
   ``It has been the PPP's stand that Islam, like in the past, is
again being used to perpetuate oppressive rule.''
   Gen. Zia, who also is chief of the army, surprised the nation on
May 29 by firing his entire civilian government and dissolving the
National Assembly.
   He claimed that in three years in power, they failed to enact
the Islamic code and to battle deteriorating law and order.
   Zia hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days but
he has yet to set a date.
   Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
bhutto, in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years later
for complicity in a murder plot.
   After ruling eight years with martial law, Zia allowed creation
of a civilian government in 1985. The opposition press dubbed his
firing of that government ``Zia's second coup d'etat.''
   Ms. Bhutto had cautiously welcomed the prospect of new elections
after having boycotted the 1985 voting, but she lashed out at Zia's
latest move as an abuse of power.
   ``We believe it is not the business of a caretaker government or
an individual to impose their views on the nation,'' she was quoted
as saying. ``As in the past, we will resist any such move.''
   She repeated her call for free elections and denied reports that
her advancing pregnancy would keep her from preaching the party's
platform of popular socialism.
   She married Karachi businessman Asif Zardari last December and
at 35, is expecting her first child this December.
   ``We would like constitutional continuity which calls for
elections within 90 days. If you break this continuity, it would
amount to opening a Pandora's box,'' Ms. Bhutto was quoted as
saying.

   Hackers penetrated a non-classified
Defense Department computer network last month, rummaging through
data at a Navy base, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and at least
one other center, the space agency said Thursday.
   The break-in occurred the night of May 16 and lasted into the
early morning hours of May 17, but no damage was done, said Haskell
G. O'Brien, the laboratory's manager of communications and
computing network services.
   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigating
the details of this,'' O'Brien told a news conference.
   It was unknown whether more than one person was involved or if
the break-in was achieved from inside or outside the United States,
O'Brien said. Unauthorized computer access is illegal, he added.
   Thousands of computers are linked to the network at hundreds of
U.S. and foreign universities and research centers, including
military research centers and other National Aeronautics and Space
Administration offices, he said.
   O'Brien described it as a non-classified network for sharing
scientific information. The network, named ARPANET, is operated by
the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   He said he considered the incident serious because programs used
to design microcircuits could have been damaged and because ``if
someone burglarizes my house, I'm offended. If someone accesses my
computer, I'm equally offended.''
   ``The Department of Defense regards as serious any attempt to
gain unauthorized access to its computer systems,'' Pentagon
spokeswoman Susan Hansen said in Washington. ``Let me assure you,
however, that there is no indication that any classified
information has been obtained by such hacker activity.''
   The break-in was the third known violation of computer security
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in two years, O'Brien said. He
cited a previously publicized August 1986 break-in by a West German
hacker, or computer buff, and another last summer, in which the
perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.
   O'Brien said the hacker in last month's incident first gained
access to the Pentagon network through another computer at an
undisclosed location. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password _
the name of a JPL employee _ to enter the lab's computer, he added.
   The hacker then used the JPL computer as a conduit to enter
another ARPANET computer at Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland,
where authorities noticed something was amiss and notified the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, O'Brien said. He added that he didn't know
how many other computers also were penetrated.
   The lab's chief spokesman, George Alexander, initially said
members of the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, broke
into the Digital Equipment Corp. computer at the laboratory, but he
later retracted the statement.
   ``We don't know for a fact that it was Chaos. ... There are
things that make us suspicious, but the bottom line fact is we
don't know,'' Alexander said.
   ``They're not kids,'' Alexander said of the club's members.
``They're adults. They are a worrisome group to American computer
experts. They're not just hackers doing pranks. They are group
whose motives and aims are not entirely clear.''
   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, West
Germany, that he was unaware of the break-in, but would check into
the matter further.
   ``One thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is they (the
hackers) didn't get into any classified data banks nor did they get
into any sensitive information in the lab,'' Alexander said.
   Alexander said that as soon as the break-in was discovered, ``we
pulled JPL out of the network.''
   Several days after the break-in, Digital Equipment and JPL
officials ``rebuilt the system to make sure that if they (hackers)
planted any viruses, we were not going to continue using the
operating system they had been mucking around with,'' he said.
   A computer virus is a program surreptitiously inserted into a
computer to disrupt its normal program.
   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-old
West German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.
military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins were
detected in August 1986.
   Targets included computers at JPL, the Air Force Systems Command
in El Segundo, Calif., and at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in
Berkeley, Calif.
   In September, members of Chaos Computer Club announced that
youths who weren't club members used home computers to break into a
NASA computer information network used by at least nine nations,
and that they obtained secrets about the U.S. space program.
   The club said the hackers gained regular access to at least 20
NASA computers between May and September 1987 through a flaw in the
security system.
   At the time, NASA officials in Washington denied that secret
information had been obtained through its computer network.

   Willie Velasquez, who dedicated his
career to increasing Hispanic political power, died Wednesday after
a bout with cancer, officials said. He was 44.
   Velasquez, 44, president of the non-profit Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project he helped found in 1972, died at
12:55 a.m. at Santa Rosa Hospital, said spokeswoman Terrie Carter.
   SVREP initially focused on voter registration and later, with
other organizations, sued local governments to convert from
at-large voting systems to single-member districts to assure equal
Hispanic representation.
   Velasquez, who was diagnosed with a cancerous left kidney, was
admitted to the hospital Monday. He had received treatment at M.D.
Anderson Hospital in Houston last month and was to begin
chemotherapy within weeks.
   Velasquez' nonpartisan efforts helped to increase Hispanic voter
registration, which has increased from 2.5 million in 1976 to an
expected 5 million for the general election in November.
   Velasquez was a founder of the activist Mexican-American Youth
Organization and later became a coordinator of El Movimiento Social
de la Raza Unida, before it became the Chicano political party.
   While in his last semester of graduate school of economics at
St. Mary's University in 1968, Velasquez was recruited by the
United Farm Workers to organize a strike in the Rio Grande Valley.
   After the strike, he became director of the Mexican-American
Unity Council in San Antonio and in June 1970, field director in
Phoenix of the National Council of La Raza, parent organization of
the Mexican-American Unity Council.
   Velasquez is survived by his wife, Jane; two daughters and a son.

   Five Costa Rican fishermen drifted 3,600 miles
in five months after their boat ran out of fuel, surviving on
rainwater and fish until their rescue 700 miles southeast of
Hawaii, the Coast Guard said Thursday.
   ``We ate anything that came near our boat, such as fish, turtles
and sharks,'' Joel Omar Gonzalez, one of the fishermen, told the
Coast Guard. ``We got water because it rained a few days and we
managed to fill a lot of empty cans we had on board our boat.''
   The Kinei Maru 128, a Japanese tuna boat, spotted the 30-foot
Cadiro 3 adrift 700 miles southeast of Honolulu on Wednesday. The
tuna boat rescued the men and left the Cadiro 3 drifting, said
Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Crawley.
   The Cadiro 3 set out Jan. 19 from Puntarenas, Costa Rica, for an
eight-day fishing trip, he said.
   ``A storm came upon us so we started heading for shore, but the
winds were too strong and they pulled us out to sea,'' Gonzalez
said. ``We ran out of deisel and have been adrift ever since then.''
   Crawley said as the boat drifted across the Pacific Ocean, the
men ate anything they could catch.
   ``We survived by throwing over bait which we had for our fishing
trip,'' Gonzalez said.
   Crawley said the fishermen communicated with the Coast Guard via
the tuna boat's radio. All five were reported in good conditon.
   Crawley identified the other sailors as captain Gerardo Obregon
Orando, George Fernandez Castillo, Pastor Lopez Rojas and Juan
Cernas Bolivar. The Coast Guard did not have the men's ages.
   The Kinei Maru 128, which sails out of Iwate, Japan, was
scheduled to arrive in Honolulu on Friday morning, Crawley said.

<HEAD>Study: AIDS Carriers Show No Mental Problems Until Symptoms

   People infected with the AIDS virus
show no sign of mental problems until they develop physical
symptoms associated with the deadly disease, a U.S. government
study shows.
   ``We're not seeing any difference whatsoever in terms of a
number of psychological measures known to be sensitive to virtually
any form of brain damage,'' said one of the study's authors, Dr.
Ola Selnes, a psychologist at the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions in Baltimore.
   He presented the findings Wednesday at the Fourth International
Conference on AIDS.
   Also at the meeting, Dr. Jonas Salk, the polio vaccine pioneer,
described his first efforts toward an AIDS vaccine.
   In a separate report, Dr. Daniel Zagury, the daring French
scientist who in 1986 injected himself with an experimental AIDS
vaccine of his own devising, said that with booster shots he has
developed antibodies that might be capable of destroying the AIDS
virus.
   And in a study of the distribution of clean needles and syringes
to drug addicts in Amsterdam, researchers said they found that such
a program does not encourage drug abuse and may well reduce the
transmission of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.
   The study by Selnes and Dr. Justin McArthur, also of Hopkins,
was intended to resolve questions raised by earlier studies that
had found distinct mental problems, such as loss of memory and
mental slowness, in people infected with the AIDS virus. Those
changes sometimes seemed to appear before any other signs of AIDS
infection.
   As a result, concern was expressed that people in sensitive
jobs, such as airline pilots, nuclear reactor operators or
operators of heavy industrial equipment, should be removed from
their positions if they become infected with the AIDS virus, even
if they are not outwardly sick.
   ``Based on our results, we do not feel there is any cause for
alarm or concern,'' Selnes said. The study was sponsored by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   The debate involves whether mental problems appear early in the
course of infection, before other diseases strike. There is general
agreement that about 70 percent of those who die of AIDS have
significant mental and neurological problems after other symptoms
develop, according to a report released in March by the World
Health Organization.
   That report concluded that there was no evidence for mental or
neurological problems in otherwise healthy people infected with the
AIDS virus.
   Selnes and McArthur followed 201 people for two years.
Eighty-two were uninfected with the AIDS virus, 88 had been
infected for a long time and 31 had been infected for a relatively
brief period.
   The patients were examined every six months with a variety of
psychological tests, and no differences were seen between the
infected and uninfected subjects, Selnes said.
   Salk said in a report on his vaccine research that he has
completed the first human trials of an unusual vaccine intended to
keep infected people from developing AIDS.
   He said he had given the vaccine to nine men with ARC, or
AIDS-related complex, an AIDS-like disease that can progress to
AIDS.
   The vaccine appears safe, he said. It also appears to raise
levels of immune system cells, and in one of the subjects the virus
seemed to disappear completely.
   That has persuaded Salk to continue trials with 54 AIDS-infected
people who have not yet developed AIDS or ARC.
   In a separate report, Zagury, a University of Paris scientist,
said his administration of an experimental vaccine to himself in
1986 had enhanced his body's production of antibodies against the
AIDS virus.
   The vaccine consisted of a specially modified smallpox virus
containing a portion of the AIDS virus. He gave himself booster
shots of his own blood cells, which he had extracted and infected
with the same type of modified virus before reinjecting them.
   He said his body has produced high levels of AIDS antibodies,
some of which may be capable of neutralizing the AIDS virus.
   Ernest Buning, a psychologist with the Amsterdam Municipal
Health Service, said that four years of providing clean syringes
and needles to drug addicts in the Dutch city has produced a
significant drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb AIDS
spread.
   The needle exchange program gave health workers an opportunity
to tell addicts how to lower their AIDS risk, and that counselling
was a critical component of the exchange program, said Buning.
   ``Our conclusion is that the needle and syringe exchange helps
addicts to use drugs safely,'' he said. Furthermore, he said, the
program did not lead to increased drug use, as critics of such
programs had feared.
   The first U.S. needle exchange program will begin soon in
Portland, Ore., under the sponsorship of the American Foundation
for AIDS Research.

   Amid all the hoopla over Mick Dundee, John
Rambo, Willow Ufgood and other heroes of the new film season, the
infamous Jason might be overlooked.
   Not by Paramount Pictures.
   ```Friday the 13th' is a gold mine that keeps on rolling
along,'' declares Sidney Ganis, president of worldwide marketing
for Paramount. The studio reports that the first six films in the
series have grossed over $172 million, not to mention the big
videocassette sales, cable TV, syndication and a TV series.
   In its first 18 days, ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New
Blood'' sold almost $16 million worth of tickets in the United
States and Canada. Since the film cost $3.5 million _ about 1/18th
the budget of ``Rambo III'' _ it should already be solidly in the
black.
   ``Part VII'' profited by premiering on Friday the 13th of May;
the series always does better business when released on that
fateful day.
   ``Jason has become part of the vernacular,'' Ganis said. ``Why?
I think because he is genuinely frightening, and teen-agers
genuinely love to be frightened. My own daughter loved `Friday the
13th III.' Now she has seen `VII' and then she goes to see (the
more arty) `The Moderns.' A whole generation has grown up on Jason
and keeps going back.''
   Jason began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980, in a
low-budget thriller created by producer-director Sean Cunningham.
Ironically, Cunningham devised the title when he was planning a
children's television show. He figured it might work for the title
of a feature film, and he was right. ``Friday the 13th'' grossed an
amazing $40 million.
   Cunningham, who is now filming another horror film, ``Deep
Six,'' signed over his rights to Paramount, and the series has had
five other directors. The formula remains the same as in the
original, which starred Kevin Bacon, later of ``Footloose'' fame,
Harry Crosby, son of Bing, and Betsy Palmer as Jason's mother.
   The action _ lots of it _ always takes place at Camp Crystal
Lake. Jason returns from the dead, wearing a hockey mask and
wielding an ax to pay back a grudge. Many years ago when he was a
camper he drowned in the lake because his inattentive counselors
were making love in the bushes. Jason's vengeance is wreaked upon
the human race in general, with special emphasis on oversexed
counselors.
   John Carl Buechler, a special effects expert who became a
director (``Troll,'' ``Cellar Dweller''), directed ``Friday the
13th VII'' from a script by Daryl Haney. Buechler (pronounced
Beekler) says he saw possibilities of applying two new twists to
the same saga.
   ``One, I thought it would be good to have a main character in
the story, someone the audience could cry and cheer for, and follow
her through the nightmare world,'' he said. ``She is the teen-ager
(Lar Park Lincoln) whose special powers release Jason from his
grave at the bottom of the lake. Telling the story from one
person's viewpoint had only been done once before (in Part V).
   ``Two, I added a substantial element of the supernatural. Before
Part VII, Jason was a mindless man who jumped out of closets and
killed people. Since he was resurrected by electricity in Part VI,
he was now, practically speaking, a ghost. That made him a
virtually unstoppable humanoid.
   ``So I thought it would be fun to fill the last two reels with
false endings. I wanted the audience to say, `Oh, he's up, now he's
down, he's dead. No, he's up again!' My aim was more fantasy than
reality.''
   Even with the innovations, Buechler was careful not to tamper
too much with the ``Friday the 13th'' formula.
   ``I was hired to satisfy the producers; if I was hired to do a
James Bond picture, I would certainly follow the Bond formula,'' he
said.
   ``Friday the 13th VII'' inevitably found disfavor with the
ratings board of the Motion Picture Association of America, which
immediately branded the film with an X for extreme gore. This would
have made the movie unsalable since a film rated X prevents anyone
under age 17 from being admitted to the theater.
   Like Jason, though, the filmmakers kept coming back again and
again with new cuts.
   ``They gave us an X six times until we finally got an R,''
Buechler said. ``I understand `Robocop' holds the record at eight.''
   Stunt man Kane Hodder is the seventh portrayer of Jason, which
might seem a thankless acting job since he doesn't speak and is
hidden behind a mask. Hodder doesn't agree.
   ``I've always wanted to play that character ever since the first
film,'' says Hodder, who has coordinated stunts for ``House,''
``Ghost Town'' and other thrillers. ``I've always believed that he
should be played by a stunt man.
   ``I think Jason is more of a challenge because he has no
dialogue. I tried to get across the feeling of menace just by using
certain head movements and body movements.''
   If the ``Friday the 13th'' films are stiumlating to teen-agers,
they are an ordeal for reviewers, whose vituperation has no
apparent effect on the audience.
   ``Critics hate the movies,'' Buechler said, ``but surprisingly,
we've had mixed reviews on VII. The common pattern is for the
reviewer to comment that Jason is here to stay, then to review the
previous one in the series and conclude, `If you liked them, you'll
like this one.'''

   What a groovy guy that Jason Voorhees is _ ahead

   He's a real human slice-and-dice machine, but not not too many

_ and he doesn't even have a speaking part.
   Here's a look at Jason's life and death and life and death in
the ``Friday the 13th'' sagas:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th'' (1980):
   Six frisky camp counselors reopen Camp Crystal Lake, which has
been closed for over two decades after a rash of unsolved murders.
A seventh, who hitchhikes to the camp, never quite makes it: She's
turned into a forest pizza. The other college-age dimwits romp
about until they, too, are carved into human kindling. Alice, the
last of the lot, runs into Mrs. Voorhees who lives nearby. She
promises to drive the hysterical girl to safety but instead talks
about her son, Jason, who drowned years ago while his counselors
made love in the woods. She turns on Alice with a hatchet; Alice
finally decapitates the madwoman and makes her way to a canoe which
drifts to the middle of the lake. In a blink, the drowned Jason
reaches up from his watery hell and grabs her. Alice abruptly
awakens in a hospital room to be told by police that Jason's body
was never found. Alice says: ``Then he's still there.''

   _ ``Friday the 13th Part 2'' (1981):
   A new batch of hot-blooded morons begin counselor training at
Lake Region, near Camp Crystal Lake. The camp leader, Paul, talks
about Jason _ an icon by now _ and says he's really alive, living
off wild animals and waiting to avenge his mother's death. One by
one, and two by two the randy counselors-to-be encounter Jason, who
enthusiastically dispatches his victims with a curved machete, a
spear thrust through two bodies, a hammer. Finally, only Paul and
his girlfriend, Ginny, are left. Thinking Paul dead, Ginny tries to
flee. She ends up at Jason's cabin where she finds a shrine to his
dead mother containing her decapitated head. Paul shows up,
struggles with Jason, and Ginny slices up the ``dead'' boy's body
with the machete. Paul and Ginny return to the cabin, and Jason
crashes through the window. Ginny wakes up in an ambulance.
``Where's Paul?'' she asks.

   _ ``Friday the 13th Part 3 _ 3-D'' (1982):
   Yet another group of idiots heads for the lake, amid newscasts
of mass murders. Three bikers show up to taunt them and are
promptly dispatched by our Jason, who picks off the vacationing
college kids with his usual finesse: He shoots an arrow through a
head, cleaves a body, electrocutes one guy, slits a neck, thrusts a
hot fireplace poker through a chest. As usual, one hysterical
female is left, Chris. After a struggle, she imbeds an ax in
Jason's head, runs to the lake and paddles a canoe to the center _
silly girl. When she awakens in the morning, Mrs. Vorhees' body,
dripping with rotted flesh, explodes from the water and pulls Chris
under. Police take a deranged Chris away and we catch one last (?)
glimpse of Jason, the ax still rooted in his skull, his fingers
twitching.

<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th _ The Final Chapter'' (1984):
   Ten people have been slaughtered at Crystal Lake. Jason also
lies dead. The bodies are taken to the morgue where Jason, perky as
ever, rises up, slits the throat of an attendant and guts a nurse.
Back at the lake, Mrs. Jarvis and her two children, Trish and
Tommy, are in their summer home. A group of teen-agers has moved in
next door. The party's soon over, though, as they're harpooned,
crucified, hacksawed and otherwise minced. But Tommy is a horror
freak who has a makeup collection, masks and clippings about Jason.
He saves his sister and himself by putting on a hockey mask,
confusing Jason and grabbing the machete. Tommy whacks his personal
hero again, and again and again.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th _ A New Beginning'' (1985):
   Tommy Jarvis is now 18 and has nightmares about Jason. He lives
at a halfway house after being released from a mental institution.
Then the murders begin with axes, hunting knives and hedge shears
as the weapons du jour. Finally, Tommy comes face to face with
Jason who falls from a hayloft onto the steel spike teeth of a
tractor harrow. Rain washes away makeup from the corpse's face and
reveals the killer as a paramedic pretending to be Jason. Tommy,
who still has nightmares, is back in the hospital. He smiles
knowingly, pulls a hockey mask from his bureau, hides behind the
door and waits.

<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part VI _ Jason Lives'' (1986):
   Crystal Lake has changed its name to Forest Green. Tommy Jarvis
is now an adult and still haunted. He believes that the only way he
ever have a normal life is to make sure Jason is REALLY dead. So he
returns to Crystal Lake to see Jason's grave. He pries open the
coffin during a storm, and a bolt of lightning hits the crowbar
he's used, sending a charge through the decayed corpse. The
rejuvenated Jason works his way back to the lake leaving a trail of
blood and guts. Tommy follows him, lures him to the lake and
somehow traps Jason in chains and rocks so that he sinks to his
original watery grave.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ ``Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood'' (1988):
   Tina Shepard is telekinetic. While at Crystal Lake, her father
dies and she tries to bring him back. Instead, she accidentally
brings back Jason, who sets about doing what he does best.
Ultimately, Jason and Tina face off. Only this time when she does
some fancy brain work, she brings back her dead father, who
struggles with Jason and pulls him back to the depths of the lake,
where they set up housekeeping together until the next time?

   It's not exactly a role actors would kill for,
but kill indeed they do.
   Seven men have portrayed Jason Voorhees, the masked and
multilated corpse who refuses to stay dead in the seven ``Friday
the 13th'' movies.
   The Jasons have ranged from a professional trapeze artist to a
nightclub manager who had no acting experience:
   1. Ari Lehman was 14 when he launched Jason's blood binge in
``Friday the 13th.'' In the movie that made sequels a thriving
business, he's only seen in two scenes: a flashback when Jason
drowns as a child in Crystal Lake, and at the end of the film when
his rotting corpse rises from the lake to grab the lone survivor of
his mother's murder rampage.
   Now in his 20s, Lehman has left acting and plays with a
funk-rock band.
   2. Warrington Gillette, the evil killer in ``Part 2,'' majored
in economics at Villanova University. He studied acting with Lee
Strasberg in New York before going to California where he joined
the Hollywood Stunt Man's Association. He's worked in comedy
workshops, did a movie documentary on Saratoga, N.Y., and has
appeared on the TV soap opera, ``General Hospital.''
   3. Richard Brooker, Jason in the 3D version, is a professional
trapeze artist who has appeared in cirucuses throughout the world.
He also does high wire, juggles and works on the trampoline. He
studied acting at such theater companies as The Stage and Riverside
Studio and has appeared in commercials.
   4. Ted White, a stunt man and actor who played Jason in ``Part
IV,'' had never seen a ``Friday the 13th'' movie. His credits
include ``The Creature From the Black Lagoon.''
   5. Richard Wieand, who plays a paramedic posing as Jason in
``Part V,'' does soap operas and commercials.
   In an interview with People magazine, he talked about his
audition for the part: ``The director told me to stare at an empty
desk and react as if I saw my son laying there hacked to bits.''
   6. C.J. Graham, who managed a nightclub, was the sixth Jason. He
got the part after portraying Jason for a club performance by an
illusionist who was a friend of the company that did special
effects for the ``Friday the 13th'' movies. He suggested Graham,
who had no acting experience, as the next Jason. 7. Kane Hodder, a
stunt coordinator, stunt man and actor, has performed stunts in
over 25 movies and more than 40 TV shows. He might be the last
Jason, but who knows?

<HEAD>Bakker: I'm Staying Until I Get PTL Back</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sitting in his tiny store-front office
just down the street from the sprawling grounds of Heritage USA,
Jim Bakker predicted he would soon regain control of the PTL
Ministry.
   ``God doesn't take you halfway and dump you,'' said Bakker, who
resigned from the television ministry last year in the wake of a
sex scandal and is under investigation by a federal grand jury.
``I've been building this place for 15 years. I'm staying until I
get it back.''
   Even the ever-optimistic Bakker admitted it will be an uphill
climb for him and his wife, Tammy Faye, to get back PTL. They
intend to present a reorganization plan for the Christian retreat
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia, S.C., before June 29.
   ``We are also placing an advertisement in a local newspaper
asking all former employees who are interested in being a part of
the Jim and Tammy ministry to come to the office and fill out a
form,'' he said Wednesday. ``These are not job applications; it's
just a survey to see how many are interested.''
   Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds has already told PTL officials
to sell land, buildings and other assets to raise enough money to
settle claims against the ministry that could reach $130 million.
   Last month, PTL officials worked out a deal with businessman
George Shinn calling for Shinn to buy all or most of PTL's property
at Heritage USA and lease parts of the ministry to a new church.
   Shinn, who owns Charlotte's new National Basketball Association
franchise and a minor league baseball team, has declined to say how
much he will offer for the complex. Estimates have ranged from $75
million to $100 million.
   M.C. ``Red'' Benton, the court-appointed trustee at PTL, has
said there are several other offers and vowed to treat any proposal
from Bakker fairly.
   ``I'm more convinced at this moment that we will be back at
Heritage USA than at any time in nearly a year and a half,'' said
Bakker, adding that he hopes to buy some television time to promote
his plan.
   Bakker returned to South Carolina in early June and opened an
office in a shopping mall next door to the headquarters of the
``Bring Back Bakkers'' club.
   ``I've yet to meet a negative person,'' Bakker said in an
interview Monday in his office decorated with photographs of him
and Tammy. ``We came here psychologically prepared for battle. But
people have been coming up to us in the restaurants and on the
street to give us their support.''
   Since his return, Bakker said, a car dealer gave him a new car
and other offers have been made.
   ``They told me they only have one question, `What can we do to
get Jim and Tammy back?' '' he said. ``Never before have I had such
an outward expression of support from local business people.''
   Not all business owners share that sentiment.
   ``There's still too much of a bad taste in people's mouths,''
said Sharon Haney, who owns a small leather shop across the street
from Heritage USA.
   Several blocks away, Marge Wilson, who operates a craft shop,
said, ``I don't think Jim can make it work. So many people are so
disgusted. I'm the first to forgive, but ...''
   At Heritage USA, the impact of the Bakkers' departure is
apparent. The water slide is closed. Shuttle buses that transport
visitors to the various attractions are nearly empty. Main Street,
a collection of shops and restaurants, looks like a ghost town.
   The park's nearly 1,500 employees of a year ago have been cut by
nearly two-thirds, to just over 500.
   ``The mood around here used to be a three-ring circus. Now it's
like a cemetery,'' said Barbara Crisp, who has been coming to
Heritage USA from Lenoir, N.C., with her husband for six years.
   Still, she doesn't know if she wants the Bakkers back.
   ``Everyone is deserving of a second chance, but they have to
come back truly repentant,'' she said. ``The thing that disturbs me
is when Tammy said, `What did we do wrong?' That boggles my mind.
What about the credit cards and selling Heritage three times over?''
   The Bakkers also have their fervent supporters.
   ``No one can run this place like Jim,'' said Loretta Graves, of
Charlotte, who stopped by during a break from job hunting. ``If God
can forgive him, I can.''
   Bakker declined to give details of his reorganization plan, and
he won't identify any financial backers.
   ``We'll present a conservative plan without any pie-in-the-sky
deals,'' he said. ``It's built on our track record of the past. I
plan to restore it to where I left it and go beyond.
   ``I think we can help people because of what we've been
through,'' Bakker said. ``They want to know, `Does the Bible really
work?' We've been through one of the most devastating times of just
about any public figures in history.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says its campaign to reduce
atmospheric pollution is working, but some among Athen's 3.5
million people are not so sure.
   For years, the capital has been plagued by a brown layer of
noxious smoke, exhaust fumes and factory emissions that Athenians
call the ``nefos,'' Greek for cloud.
   On a warm windless day, the ``nefos'' sends an average of 300
Athenians to hospitals complaining of headaches, chest pains,
nausea and stinging eyes.
   ``I drive around Athens all day and when I get home my nose is
clogged and my hair is oily from the fumes,'' said Michalis
Leontsakos, one of the city's 15,000 taxi drivers. ``And when
summer hits, it's much worse.''
   Last July a 10-day heatwave compounded the smog problem and more
than 1,200 mostly poor and elderly Athenians died of heatstroke or
breathing problems.
   Officials in Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's Socialist
government maintain, however, that a new package of anti-smog
measures is producing results and that last summer's high
temperatures are unlikely to recur.
   ``The recent package has been particularly productive,''
Environment Minister Evangelos Kouloumbis said. ``We have had a 15
to 25 percent reduction in overall pollution levels.''
   The smog forms over the mountain-ringed Athens basin on warm,
still days.
   The sun heats up a layer of cold night air close to the ground
and the air then rises into the lower atmosphere where it acts as a
barrier that traps the warmer pollutants under it.
   The problem is aggravated by the lack of parks and green spaces
in Athens' concrete sprawl. The city has just 23 square feet of
greenery per resident, compared to 107 square feet in Rome, 215 in
Vienna, Austria, and 290 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
   Environmental scientists blame the city's 750,000 cars,
diesel-powered taxis, buses and trucks for 75 percent of the smog.
   ``If you take away half the cars, you'd only have half the
problem,'' said Dimitris Hadzidakis, a chemical engineer with the
state-run pollution control program. ``Traffic would move faster
and you'd have few engines idling.''
   To cut down on traffic the government abolished Greece's
traditional split working day with its three-hour midday break.
Stores now stay open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and the change
eliminated two of the city's four rush hours.
   The new measures also ban half the city's taxis from the
five-square mile city center on alternate days and have closed a
two-square mile central commercial district to traffic.
   But despite the government claims, some people who work in the
city center say they can't see much improvement.
   ``The nefos seems to be the same and fewer people shop in the
afternoon hours because of the heat and smog,'' said Michalis
Vitos, a shoe store clerk. ``The summer looks like its going to be
worse and will definitely cut business.''
   Half the city's private cars have been banned from the center on
alternate days since 1984. Cars with license plates ending in even
numbers drive on even-numbered days and vice versa.
   ``We think that updated cars burning unleaded gas must gradually
replace Athens' current fleet of private automobiles,'' said
Environment Minister Kouloumbis.
   But Greeks complain they can't afford to buy new cars because of
import taxes that triple the basic price. Transportation Ministry
statistics indicate the average private car in Athens is 10 years
old.
   The government's 1985 target of a 27 percent pollution reduction
by 1990 is still on track, but it may take 20 more years to fully
solve the problem, environment officials say.
   ``The trouble is the city's spreading faster that we can reduce
the pollution ... and there are 30,000 more cars on the streets
every year,'' said Hadzidakis, the chemical engineer.
   The government has banned low quality heating fuel and insists
that filters be installed on Athens' 120 main industrial plants by
the end of this year.
   But independent environmental researchers say the measures still
aren't radical enough.
   ``To solve the pollution problem, you'd have to remove all
industry from Athens ... and find some way to make at least 1
million Athenians move at least 30 kilometers (19 miles) out of the
city,'' said Panayiotis Christodoulakis, president of the
Panhellenic Center for Ecological Studies.

   Mother Teresa on Wednesday gave her best
wishes to the U.N. conference on disarmament and gave delegates a
new issue to ponder by saying ``abortion has become the greatest
destroyer of peace.''
   ``I think the world has never needed so much tender love as
today,'' she told reporters after she met Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar for a courtesy call.
   Mother Teresa, 77, works with and is the founder of the
international Missionaries of Charity, a religious order in
Calcutta. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work
to ease the suffering of dying slum dwellers, and is known there as
the ``saint of the gutters.''
   The small, frail-looking woman, wearing a white cotton shawl and
blue-trimmed robe, spoke fiercely against ``the evil of abortion,
of destroying children, of neglecting children.''
   ``We're fighting abortion by adoption, and we have saved
thousands of children from being destroyed, because as you know
abortion has become the greatest destroyer of peace because it
destroys the child, the gift of God. And it destroys the conscience
of the mother, it is actually a double killing.''
   When asked if she discussed with Perez de Cuellar the U.N.
population control programs, she said she had not. Many
anti-abortion activists have criticized the programs, saying them
promote abortion as a possible option.
   ``I think we talked of other things, that we didn't say,'' she
replied.
   Another reporter asked her why the concept of non-violence does
not seem to work in South Africa, where Mohandas K. Gandhi lived
for 21 years and where Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize winner, carries on the tradition of peaceful
civil disobedience today.
   Mother Teresa said ``non-violence begins at home,'' adding,
``Our government in India and the government of South Africa have
given us full permission to go to South Africa. And we have a
mixture of all nationalities, and I am going to take take with me
different nationalities, different colors, and bring there with me
the joy of loving.''
   She said she was in New York to try to open a center to care for
children infected with AIDS.

<TEXT>
   In the end, Vice President George Bush's
appearance at the Agriculture Department for a drought briefing was
outshone by a career federal meteorologist's description of the
trouble spots and how they could worsen.
   Reporters who had been herded into a room to look at the vice
president, then herded out, ended up only with a written statement
in which Bush declared that rain is needed to end the drought
plaguing large portions of the country.
   Bush, accompanied by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and a White
House entourage, met Wednesday for about half an hour in the office
of Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   For a while, the placid atmosphere of the old USDA
administration building was charged by the swarming of security
forces assigned to protect the vice president, who is expected to
be the Republican presidential nominee.
   The main elevators were stopped, and employees were routed far
around the sensitized area where Bush was to enter and walk within
the building. The department's flock of public affairs specialists
scurried and fluttered about.
   It was an exciting time for almost everyone _ except for
reporters looking for news.
   Reporters, photographers and television technicians were herded
into a conference room, or a holding pen, where they were required
to put all tape recorders and cameras on the floor and then move
outside to a hallway.
   Dozens of Secret Service and USDA security people hovered close
while a large German Shepherd was taken into the abandoned holding
area to sniff the equipment for bombs or weapons. None was found.
   After more waiting, the two dozen or so news people were allowed
to walk up one flight to Lyng's outer office. The group was allowed
to enter for a ``photo opportunity'' at which the subjects are
often asked questions over the clicks and whirrs of cameras.
   But Norton Strommen, the USDA's chief meteorologist, was
explaining a set of yellow-and-red charts to his audience,
including Bush and Dole, who were seated on a couch, and Lyng and
others in the official party.
   No questions were shouted by reporters while Strommen talked.
After a few minutes, all news people were sternly ordered out of
Lyng's office. Those who tried to tarry in the area were finally
herded downstairs again and lodged behind a yellow tape that
represented a security boundary.
   Bush and Dole then zipped out USDA's front door without enduring
a single question from reporters about drought or anything else.
   In his wake, Bush left a single-page statement noting that if
relief doesn't come soon, the corn crop could be in jeopardy.
``Without rain there is the potential for this to be a
catastrophe,'' he said, echoing Lyng's congressional testimony of
the day before.
   Bush said farmers in 21 states are receiving some form of
emergency relief, ``but sad to say, nothing will take the place of
rainfall, and we have to be concerned about the plight of the
nation's farmers.''
   Strommen filled in the gaps later, gathering up his charts and
leading reporters back into the conference room where he summarized
his presentation to Bush and Dole.
   Strommen said the West is severely lacking in moisture from
reduced snowpack during the winter, which resulted in
``well-below-normal'' reservoir levels in much of the region,
including Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Nevada.
   Another major problem area is in the northern Great Plains,
notably in Montana and the Dakotas, he said. And dry areas still
persist in the Southeast, which has not yet fully recovered from
the 1986 drought.
   ``The best areas in terms of moisture are the Southwest, up into
the central Great Plains ... in Kansas and Nebraska,'' Strommen
said.
   Just in the last two weeks, the drought has expanded into the
eastern Corn Belt states of the Midwest, and ``this is a major
concern for us,'' he said.
   Without substantial rains soon, Strommen said the Corn Belt
drought has a ``potential for deterioration'' of crops.
   However, he said, ``it simply is too early in the growing season
to try to define what that potential is.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Toronto Summit is Reagan's Final Bow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will be bidding farewell to
summitry next week in Toronto.
   Eight years ago, Reagan went to his first economic summit in
Montebello, Quebec, as an untried figure on the world scene, a
former movie actor reading his remarks from cue cards, on the
defensive about a huge budget deficit, and espousing economic
beliefs that some of his colleagues found dubious if not ridiculous.
   On Sunday, he leaves Washington for his last economic summit.
Once again, it will be in Canada. Reagan will still be reading from
cue cards. He still has the same conservative beliefs. The U.S.
budget deficit has zoomed from $78.9 billion in 1981 to an
estimated $146.7 billion.
   But this time, it's different.
   For one thing, Reagan has been in office longer than any of the
other summit leaders except his staunch ally from Britain, Margaret
Thatcher. She and France's Francois Mitterrand will be the only
leaders there who were on board in 1981.
   For another, the president's aides are confident this time of
the kind of reception Reagan will get from his colleagues as he
makes what will almost surely be his final bow on the global stage.
   ``I think they have learned what the rest of the world learned,
which was not to underestimate Ronald Reagan,'' the president's
chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said.
   ``I'm told that at the first summit, he was regarded as a sort
of quaint, amusing character from the past, when he talked about
markets and private enterprise and entrepreneurship,'' said
Undersecretary of State Allen Wallis. ``Now, at the summits that's
all they do _ everybody talks in that framework.''
   ``I hope and believe that there is going to be a recognition on
the part of all of the countries there that reliance on free
markets and reliance on open societies is the best way to foster
economic growth and sound economic development,'' said Secretary of
the Treasury James A. Baker III.
   ``This is the message, if I may say so, that President Reagan
took to the first economic summit in 1981, a message at the time
that was greeted with a certain skepticism and perhaps even some
derision,'' Baker said. ``And now, it is not so greeted, and
everybody is pretty much in sync and on board with that concept and
I think, hope and believe there will be a further endorsement of
that at this summit.''
   A European official in Washington, speaking on condition he not
be identified, said there is still some skepticism abroad, however,
about such things as Reagan's tax reduction programs and the U.S.
budget and trade deficits.
   ``I am sure President Reagan has, since 1981, marked
cornerstones on a number of things, but I am also sure we could not
afford the kind of policies which President Reagan affords in the
United States,'' the official said.
   As Reagan headed for Montebello eight years ago, one White House
aide, asking that he not be further identified, said, ``There is a
push that we project him as leader of the free world.'' But the
aide also indicated a fear that other participants would snipe at
the president's economic programs and challenge his influence.
   A Canadian Press writer said then that the new American chief
executive would have to rely on ``his good humor and charm'' to
cope with ``the greater international experience and intellect'' of
such leaders as Canada's Pierre Trudeau and West Germany's Helmut
Schmidt.
   Now, as Reagan prepares to go to Toronto, Fitzwater said: ``I
think they will see that the man they see in 1988 is the same man
they saw in 1980. The difference is what he's done, that he's
changed the face of the world. In terms of military strength,
certainly the strength of focus and purpose of NATO has been
strengthened by the president's commitment to it.''
   Fitzwater added: ``East-West relations have changed dramatically
under the president's leadership. The world economy is so much
stronger now than it was in 1980 and 1981. Those three elements of
achievement have given Ronald Reagan a whole new stature.
   ``Because Reagan is leaving office after so many years,
undoubtedly there will be a tribute to him of some kind,''
Fitzwater said. ``I don't know any specifics planned in terms of
organization, but I am sure the discussions and the statements will
in some way recognize the leadership that the president has given
to the economic summits.''

<HEAD>Bush Says He Would Take Income, Assets of Drug Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says he endorses a
House Republican plan to confiscate 25 percent of the adjusted
gross income and net assets of anyone caught possessing illegal
substances.
   Bush took center stage Wednesday at a House Republican news
conference, as he combined his support for the GOP plan with a
blistering partisan attack that was cheered by dozens of his
supporters attending the event.
   ``I'm sick and tired ... in hearing the Democrats do nothing but
tear down and criticize'' the Reagan administration's attempts to
halt drug abuse, Bush said. ``I'm talking about Jesse Jackson and
Michael Dukakis the last two months.''
   The Republican plan also calls for the death penalty for drug
kingpins, and it would require that states suspend the driver's
license of anyone convicted of using drugs, or face loss of federal
highway funding.
   Dukakis, in Framingham, Mass., hit back on the drug issue,
criticizing the Reagan administration for permitting Coast Guard
budget cuts that have idled drug interdiction patrols.
   ``How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs
when we're cutting Coast Guard patrols by 55 percent? It's that
kind of thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the
presidency,'' Dukakis said.
   In addition to the vice president, administration officials
appeared all over the Capitol complex Wednesday to testify on the
drug problem. The top Coast Guard officer discussed the cuts in his
agency's drug patrols. The administration's chief budget official
and the defense secretary testified on the need for drug-free
workplaces.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told lawmakers that
America's defense contractors will soon be ordered to provide a
drug-free workplace environment for their 3.2 million employees.
   The hundreds of defense contractors would be required to develop
extensive education programs about the dangers of drugs; employees
with security clearances could also be required to undergo
mandatory drug testing, Carlucci said.
   An estimated 3 million workers on Pentagon contracts have
security clearances of various types. Carlucci did not say if the
testing would be required of all employees with clearances or just
those with the more sensitive access clearances.
   Carlucci testified before an unusual joint meeting of the House
and Senate Armed Services Committees.
   James C. Miller III, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, also said the Reagan administration supports efforts to
create drug-free workplaces.
   But he expressed reservations before a House Government
Operations subcommittee about legislation designed to bring about
that goal.
   A bill sponsored by committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas,
would require federal contractors and grantees to establish
drug-free workplace policies. Employees would have to observe the
policies, and sanctions could be imposed if drug use still occurred
in the workplace.
   The sanctions, which would be applied under due process
requirements, include future disbarment of contractors who are
frequent violators.
   Miller said the bill, which in part calls for employers and
employees to certify that they are complying with the law, would
require ``extensive new paperwork burdens.''
   Bush, standing with some 50 House Republicans at their news
conference, declared the GOP package ``better than anything the
Democrats are going to dream up.''
   Democrats control both houses of Congress, however, and majority
House and Senate task forces are at work developing their own drug
proposals.
   Answering reporters' questions, Bush also said he supports the
administration's ``zero tolerance'' policy of seizing property when
even a small amount of illegal drugs is found. He said, ``If some
yacht owner is inconvenienced, it's too damn bad.''
   Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., commandant of the Coast Guard, told a
House Merchant Marine subcommittee that his budget shortfall is
$103 million. He said the money problem ``is proving to be a
serious blow to our operations'' against drug smugglers.
   ``There is a great hue and cry from members getting on the
bandwagon for new omnibus drug legislation to win the war against
drugs, and Congress is now considering a package of drug
legislation costing $2 billion,'' said Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla.,
chairman of the panel.
   ``I wonder where some of those same people were earlier this
year when this subcommittee was trying to get Congress to find the
$103 million necessary just to keep the Coast Guard ... afloat.''
   Yost said last week that the amount of drugs seized by the Coast
Guard has been reduced by about one half since the cutbacks.

<HEAD>Prospects Of Female Running Mate For Dukakis Appear Dim</HEAD>

   As Michael Dukakis begins the process of
selecting a Democratic vice presidential nominee, the surest bet in
politics is that his choice will be a man.
   Not even the women who worked so hard four years ago to get
Geraldine Ferraro on the Democratic ticket expect Dukakis to follow
Walter F. Mondale's history-making example.
   ``It certainly isn't the top-of-line discussion it was in
1984,'' said Joanne Howes, a political consultant and director of
the non-partisan Women's Vote Project.
   ``Is that a priority in his campaign this year, or in the
party?'' said Irene Natividad, director of the National Women's
Political Caucus. ``It doesn't seem like it.''
   So when Paul Brountas, the Boston lawyer who is heading the
Dukakis search for a running mate came to Washington to talk vice
presidential politics, the big names on his calling list were all
male, names like John Glenn, Sam Nunn, and Bill Bradley.
   He did pay a call on Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. But now
in her second year as a senator, she is on no one's list of vice
presidential prospects.
   Missing from Brountas' list was Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado,
who came close to running for president and is the most credible
vice presidential prospect among Democratic women.
   Three women often are mentioned as potential running mates for
Republican George Bush _ former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and former U.N. Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick. This is the party that turned its back on the
Equal Rights Amendment and demands that its national candidates
take strong stands against abortion.
   Analysts talk of a ``gender gap'' that favors Democrats, the
fact that a far higher percentage of women than men support
Democratic candidates.
   Yet, this election year, the likely women vice presidential
candidates are Republicans, not Democrats.
   ``I think the major reason is obvious,'' said Celinda Lake, a
senior associated with The Analysis Group, a Democratic polling
organization. ``There are lots of ways in which the Democrats are
turning away from the '84 experience.
   ``And one of the ways, which I think is incorrect, is they think
they would not benefit from nominating a woman as the vice
president.''
   The ``'84 experience,'' of course, was the fact the
Mondale-Ferraro ticket was beaten in 49 of 50 states as President
Reagan received an estimated 55 percent of the women's vote.
   ``I also think,'' said Lake ``there is somewhat of a shortage of
women who are both ready and willing. ... Because the Democrats
have been out of office for eight years, we don't have the women in
the administrative pipeline.''
   That view was echoed by others, including Joanne Symons, a
political consultant who worked on Rep. Richard Gephardt's
presidential campaign.
   ``There are not enough (Democratic) women in the pool,'' she
said, because a Republican president has been filling Cabinet
positions the past seven and a half years.
   Lake also cited an ambition factor.
   She listed Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, along with Schroeder
and Mikulski as Democratic women who have the stature to be vice
presidential candidates and said, ``I don't think they want it.
They want to be No. 1, not No. 2.''
   Howes said, ``The real goal is to be prepared in the 1990s for a
woman to be ready to be president of the United States and to run
for president of the United States and to win.''

<HEAD>Court Rules Homosexual Agent May Sue CIA Over Dismissal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA has suffered its first-ever defeat in
the Supreme Court and as a result must explain in federal court its
1982 firing of a homosexual spy.
   Morton Halperin of the American Civil Liberties Union here
called Wednesday's ruling by the Supreme Court a ``major victory''
in limiting what the CIA can do in the name of national security
and ``a modest step forward'' for gay rights.
   ``At the very least, it gives us the opportunity to contend that
constitutional rights have been violated,'' Halperin said.
   Steven F. Reich, a Washington lawyer who is helping represent
the fired spy, called the ruling ``a terrific victory.''
   ``The CIA is subject to the rule of law and not above the U.S.
Constitution,'' Reich said.
   The court's 6-2 ruling flatly rejected the Reagan
administration's arguments that the 1947 law creating the CIA gave
the spy agency's director virtually absolute authority to fire
employees.
   A homosexual identified in court documents only by the
fictitious name John Doe was fired by then-CIA Director William
Casey in 1982. The agency claimed Doe's homosexuality was a
security threat.
   Doe had joined the CIA as a clerk-typist in 1973 and worked his
way up to a covert job as an electronics technician, in which he
was rated an excellent agent.
   In January 1982, he voluntarily told an agency security officer
that he was gay. Doe was placed on paid leave pending an
investigation, and that May he was told he was being fired ``in the
interests of the United States.''
   Doe told agency officials that his family, neighbors and friends
knew he was a homosexual, and that he had never revealed classified
information to any unauthorized person.
   Doe's suit demands that he be reinstated.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Barred police, by a 6-2 vote in an Arizona case, from
questioning criminal suspects who already have invoked their right
to remain silent or get a lawyer's help _ even if the questions
center on some other crime.
   _Provided a victory for the Reagan administration and free-trade
advocates by ruling unanimously that the government does not have
to place restrictions on imported uranium to help protect U.S.
producers of the nuclear fuel.
   _Ruled, 7-1, in a case from Texas that business promoters
sometimes must share the liability of deals gone sour.
   _Said Kansas courts may apply that state's laws in a natural gas
royalties dispute between Sun Oil Co. and mineral rights owners
from Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, New Mexico and Louisiana.

<HEAD>Pirates Said Using Modern Business Techniques To Sell Illegal
Electronics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pirate underworld that holds seminars in the
Bahamas and advertises openly in publications is thriving on sales
of illegal decoders to backyard satellite dish owners, according to
industry officials.
   Pirates are using modern business techniques, including the
distribution of ``how to'' video tapes, to establish a sales
network for the illegal electronics, J. Lawrence Dunham, a General
Instrument Corp. executive, said in testimony submitted Wednesday
to the House telecommunications subcommittee.
   General Instrument makes the VideoCipher II decoder, whose
electronics have become the de facto industry standard. Each of the
three dozen or so cable programming services that have scrambled
their signals can be decoded by the VideoCipher.
   Industry leaders estimate that as many as half of the nearly 1
million decoders on the market have been illegally modified. With
the illegal decoders, backyard dish owners can avoid subscribing to
scrambled programming services like HBO, Showtime and other popular
cable channels. Instead, they can pick up virtually all channels
free.
   Dunham said General Instrument has responded to the piracy with
changes in the circuitry of the decoder, a public relations
campaign to let dish owners know the penalties for dealing with the
illegal electronics and an amnesty program that allowed dish owners
to trade in modified units at no cost or legal risk.
   ``In spite of these efforts, piracy has continued,'' Dunham said.
   Dunham said decoder pirates have held seminars in the Bahamas to
exchange information, run technology centers to develop new ways to
break the system and have tried to buy General Instrument's
proprietary chips from suppliers.
   Bob Phillips, chief executive officer of the National Rural
Telecommunications Cooperative, said pirates are offering full
services to the dealers and telling them the risk of getting caught
is low.
   And pirates are even making house calls, going ``door to door
where they see the satellite dishes and offer their services. They
will sell entire modified descramblers or modify your own unit at
home,'' he said.
   ``Pirates are so competitive, they have even developed programs
and systems to prevent other pirates from pirating from them,'' he
said.
   Sid Swartz, president of West Inc., a satellite TV retailer
based in Mount Vernon, Wash., said illegal decoders are costing him
business. Dealers can make a $1,000 profit on the sale of an
illegal decoder, and buyers get a sky full of permanent free
programming.
   Legal decoders retail for $395, and users then must buy a
program package, which for a variety of cable channels and a couple
of premium channels costs about $250, he said.
   ``The consumer perceives no real value in complying with the law
when all of his neighbors are apparently violating it with
impunity,'' he said in testimony to the the House Energy and
Commerce Committee panel.
   Witnesses called for swift prosecution and punishment of pirates
and tougher penalties. Currently, a first offense nets up to one
year in prison and a fine of up to $25,000.
   Charles C. Hewitt, president of the Satellite Broadcasting and
Communications Association, said that should be increased to two
years and $50,000 and five years and $100,000 for a second offense,
he said.
   The National Cable Television Association says penalties are
already stiff enough and that what's needed is more vigorous
enforcement coupled with technological innovations and ``a better
understanding by the public that piracy is a serious crime.''

<HEAD>Security Threat Posed By Drug Trafficking At Nuclear Lab, Probers
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug trafficking still poses a security threat
at a top-secret nuclear weapons laboratory in California where a
1986 undercover drug investigation was abruptly terminated under
pressure from the Energy Department, House investigators say.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said ``a drug problem continues to
exist, a security problem continues to exist'' at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory near San Francisco, where highly
sensitive research on President Reagan's Star Wars missile defense
system is conducted.
   According to staff investigators for the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee chaired by Dingell:
   _In April 1987, a Livermore electronics technician with a
high-level security clearance was caught with several hundred
dollars' worth of illicit drugs. The employee, who was working on a
classified computer system, admitted trading drugs for sex with a
female co-worker.
   _In June 1987, a security guard responsible for protecting the
laboratory's super-sensitive plutonium facility was arrested for
drug possession. He was accused of bringing drugs and paraphernalia
into his security bunker while on duty and being armed with an
automatic weapon.
   _Also last summer, another employee with top security clearance
who worked in the nuclear chemistry department resigned after he
was accused of selling thousands of dollars' worth of cocaine to
workers in sensitive areas of the laboratory.
   _Energy Department and Livermore officials are currently
investigating allegations of drug use by ``a professional
laboratory employee with access to extremely sensitive classified
information.''
   Dingell said these disclosures, following the shutdown of the
drug investigation code-named ``Operation Snowstorm'' in September
1986, raise ``serious questions about the integrity of security at
our nation's most sensitive nuclear weapons and research
facilities.''
   Energy Undersecretary Joseph F. Salgado said officials decided
to terminate the investigation ``because it had run for eight
months and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads.''
   Salgado said Operation Snowstorm had served its purpose in
putting Livermore employees on notice that drug use would not be
tolerated. He denied Dingell's charge that the Energy Department
had tried to conceal the aborted investigation from the House panel.
   At the end of a day-long hearing Wednesday, Dingell said he was
ordering an audit by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, to determine the extent of
drug-related thefts of computers and other government property at
Livermore.
   ``If they are stealing government property, why wouldn't they
steal government secrets, which are more valuable?'' Dingell asked.
   Energy Department officials responded that they were conducting
their own investigation of the theft problem and were
``aggressively pursuing'' questions of whether the laboratory's
security clearances had been compromised by drug trafficking.
   The DOE was accused Wednesday of halting the nine-month drug
investigation prematurely, leaving undercover agents unable to
pursue leads on 127 Livermore employees who were suspected drug
dealers or users.
   Patricia D'Orsa-DiJamco, a special agent of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, testified that pressure from DOE and laboratory
officials to hasten the arrest of an alleged drug trafficking
ringleader at Livermore, prevented her agency from identifying the
drug suppliers in Mexico.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a subcommittee member, suggested that
officials who terminated the drug investigation were fearful of
adverse publicity. ``It seems to me that this Operation Snowstorm
should be called `Operation Snow Job','' Wyden said.
   ``It appears that DOE was less interested in cooperating with
the DEA than in heeding the concerns of one of its contractors,''
Dingell said. He was referring to the University of California at
Los Angeles, which has a government contract to operate the
Livermore facility.
   David A. Leary, who managed the undercover investigation,
testified that many of the drug pushers among Livermore's 8,500
employees held top-secret ``Q'' security clearances. He said the
illicit drugs they were selling included cocaine, marijuana,
methamphetamine and barbiturates.
   Dingell quoted John Hunt, current chief of safeguards and
security at Livermore, as telling staff investigators that if
Operation Snowstorm had been allowed to continue, ``we would have
to arrest 20 percent of the lab.''
   Security agent Timothy L. Mitchell testified that the volume of
illicit drug trafficking at Livermore ``has the potential to
endanger national security.''
   Undercover agent Robert Buda told the panel he was ``very
flabbergasted'' that the investigation was halted just three days
before he received a ``Q'' clearance to penetrate the most
sensitive ``green badge'' areas of the laboratory.
   ``We felt like the kid in front of the candy store,'' said John
C. Barber, the University of California police chief who served as
consultant to Operation Snowstorm.
   ``We had the money in our hands and we were ready to go inside
and do business,'' Barber said. ``Unfortunately that door closed
before we could get it,'' Buda said.
   In a Jan. 7, 1987, memorandum obtained by The Associated Press,
Hunt quoted Adm. Sylvester Foley, assistant energy secretary for
defense programs, as offering the previous July to ``put pressure
on DEA to get out of our hair.'' The DEA was seeking a delay in the
Energy Department's plans to halt the drug investigation in late
summer of 1986.

<HEAD>Surgical Implantation of False Teeth Becoming More Common</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dental science has developed new techniques
and new materials for the surgical implantation of false teeth, but
there still is no definitive study on the effectiveness of the
procedure, a panel of experts says.
   A panel of dental experts, meeting at the National Institutes of
Health, released a statement Wednesday in which they said more than
300,000 Americans annually will be receiving surgically implanted
false teeth by 1992 and that the number of dentists performing such
procedures has increased by 10 times since 1983.
   But the panel said scientific and statistically precise studies
are needed to define the effectiveness of permanently implanted
false teeth.
   The panel said the cost for surgically-installed false teeth is
about $300 to $1,000 per implant and that patients can receive from
one to eight implants.
   D. Walter Cohen, president of the Medical College of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and chairman of the NIH conference on
dental implants, said the surgical installation of teeth can no
longer be considered experimental.
   Cohen said the development of new materials and new techniques
have led to wider acceptance of implantation by dentists and that
the demand for permanent false teeth is increasing among Americans.
   He said as people tend to live longer, more and more patients
are finding that they cannot use removable false teeth and are
choosing to have permanently-implanted artificial teeth.
   There are several systems for implanting false teeth in living
tissue, but they all basically involve surgically cutting into the
bone that normally supports teeth and installing a manmade peg or
post to support the false teeth, or to anchor a bridge of false
teeth.
   The NIH panel said that because scientific studies have not been
made on methods of implanting false teeth, ``it is not possible to
make judgments on the comparative merits of different implant
systems.''
   Several studies, however, show that dental implants are
effective for five to 10 years, the panel's report said.
   However, the report said that little information is available to
evaluate such factors as patient satisfaction, appearance, comfort
and the effect of implants on speech and chewing.
   Cohen said the panel also determined that the risks of
surgically implanting false teeth include the ``inadvertent''
penetration of a sinus cavity by a dentist drilling in bone to
create a socket for the implant.
   He said other problems include damage to facial nerves and
infections that could threaten existing, natural teeth.

   Rudolph Nureyev says he chose to
rework ``Cinderella'' into a Hollywood fable because he was jarred
by all other ballet productions he saw of the fairy tale.
   The Soviet-born dancer is the artistic director of the Paris
Opera Ballet, which is mounting his production of ``Cinderella'' at
the Orange County Performing Arts Center.
   Nureyev's version of Cinderella is set in the dream factories of
1930s Hollywood, and is filled with props and allusions to King
Kong, Fred Astaire, Betty Grable and the Keystone Cops.
   ``Somehow each time I saw any other production, I found it
jarring,'' Nureyev said recently. ``I thought it worked out nicely
to have Cinderella dream about becoming an actress. Every other
production looked like ``Sleeping Beauty.'''

   Patty Duke spent a good part of her tenure as
president of the Screen Actors Guild inveighing against movie
management. Now she's joined the club.
   Ms. Duke resigned Wednesday in the middle of her second term as
Guild president to produce a movie based on her autobiography,
``Call Me Anna,'' the guild announced.
   Guild by-laws state no officer or board member may hold a
production interest while in office.
   Ms. Duke's final speech as union president was Sunday at a
midyear Guild membership meeting. She attacked management for
refusing to share with unions ``record profits for a record number
of companies, and record salaries for studio executives.''
   Barry Gordon, Guild first vice president, will be acting
president until the board of directors holds its annual meeting in
December.

   After shedding more than a quarter ton,
Walter Hudson says he's gained confidence and is about to take his
first step outside his home in 17 years.
   Hudson weighed about 1,200 pounds last September, when he got
stuck in a doorway to his bathroom. He has lost about 600 pounds.
The weight is estimated because Hudson does not fit on conventional
scales, said Barbara Rosen, a psychologist who is treating him.
   ``I'm ready for the outside world,'' the 42-year-old Long Island
man said Wednesday, leaning out a back window of his Hempstead
home. ``I hope the world is ready for me.''
   Hudson wasn't as willing in February, when he turned down an
offer from comedian-nutritionist Dick Gregory to attend Gregory's
clinic in the Bahamas. Hudson already had lost several hundred
pounds under Gregory's regimen, but balked at leaving the house.
   Hudson said Wednesday he would step outside in August onto a
patio being built flush to his bedroom by volunteers.
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I feel like I've been paroled from
jail.''

   Mr. Stewart went to Washington to fight for
right and truth _ in this case, to preserve ``the creative vision''
of the directors of classic films by preventing their work from
being ``colorized.''
   Actor Jimmy Stewart, who battled corruption in the 1930's movie
``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,'' spoke with reporters Wednesday on
the eve of a congressional committee's vote on the National Film
Preservation Act of 1988.
   The measure seeks to settle the dispute over the artistic rights
of directors who object to color being added to black and white
films, or to editing or other changes made to their films by
distributors or exhibitors.
   ``I have been in the motion picture business quite a while now,
almost 60 years, and I have great respect for the motion picture,''
the 80-year-old Stewart said. ``I think it's something of
tremendous value and I want to do everything I can to preserve it.''

   The Dutch may have given up New Amsterdam to the
British in 1664, but they still have big financial interests in the
city that became New York. So Mayor Edward Koch is planning a trip
to Holland to bid for more bucks.
   Koch's visit, to begin July 19, is expected to take him to
Amsterdam, the capital, and The Hague, the seat of the Netherlands'
government, City Hall spokesman Cliff Chanin said Wednesday.
   Chanin said Koch will meet with business officials to attract
more trade for New York. ``The Dutch have a substantial financial
presence in New York,'' Chanin said.
   Afterward, Koch plans to journey to Ireland on a pilgrimage for
peace with Cardinal John J. O'Connor, the spokesman said.

   Jamie Rockefeller will have the right
to make a name for himself in two years when he can choose whether
to become John D. Rockefeller V.
   ``It's a very honorable thing that I would like to do,'' said
Jamie, at 18 the oldest child of Sen. John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller
IV, D-W.Va.
   Those in the John D. Rockefeller line are unofficially allowed
to take the full name only after they've turned 21. Jamie will turn
19 in a few weeks and plans to enter Yale University in the fall.
   ``There's a meaning that goes along with it,'' said Jamie,
great-great grandson of the turn-of-the-century industrialist.
``There's a tradition of public service and doing things for
others.''

   Bob Pettit, a National Basketball Association
star in the 1950s and '60s who went on to become a bank chairman,
has landed in federal bankruptcy court.
   Pettit has worked out an agreement with creditors, but it must
be approved by shareholders of his bank, Jefferson Guaranty, said
attorney Douglas Draper, representing him in the Chapter 11
proceedings.
   Draper said many of Pettit's problems involve Jefferson Guaranty
and lawsuits over preferred stock its parent company issued in
1984. The stock soon became virtually worthless and investors sued,
claiming they had been defrauded.
   Pettit, a member of the NBA Hall of Fame for his play with the
then-St. Louis Hawks, was the NBA's all-time leading scorer, with
20,880 points, when he retired in 1965.

   Colossus, billed as the largest captive
lowland gorilla, got his first glimpse of another member of his
species since infancy, a female on loan for breeding.He apparently
liked what he saw.
   But the match between the 6-foot-2, 570-pound Colossus and 4-8,
274-pound Muke, on loan from the St. Louis Zoo, has a long way to
go before it becomes an affair of the soap opera kind.
   Colossus' encounter with Muke on Wednesday was only a glimpse
through a small opening between their bedrooms at The Zoo in this
Pensacola suburb.
   ``Colossus has been peeking in through that little porthole over
there and been knocking the dust out of the concrete walls,'' said
Pat Quinn, director of The Zoo. ``He's very excited about this
whole affair.''
   Both gorillas are about 22 years old, prime breeding age, and
each was captured in the wilds of West Africa as an infant.
   But Colossus had been separated from other gorillas at Benson's
Animal Park in Hudson, N.H., before moving to the Florida Panhandle
in March. Muke (pronounced Moo'-key) has lived with other members
of their species at St. Louis, the Columbus Zoo and the Bronx Zoo.
   University of West Florida scientists had been preparing
Colossus for Muke's arrival by showing him National Geographic
videotapes of gorillas.
   Muke is worldly and sophisticated compared to Colossus, Quinn
said. She also has an ornery streak, picking fights even with some
male gorillas, and is said to have bitten off a keeper's finger at
the New York City zoo, he said.
   Although considered large for a female, Muke may have met her
match in Colossus. She watched him cautiously through the peephole
in the door dividing their quarters, especially when Colossus ran
over and banged on it.
   ``She's concerned, I think, about his size,'' Quinn said. ``He's
the Sylvester Stallone of the gorilla world. Hopefully, he'll be
the Bing Crosby of the gorilla world.''
   And Quinn wasn't referring to Crosby's crooning ability,
although Colossus has been very vocal since Muke's arrival Tuesday
night.
   Muke was driven to Pensacola in a well-vented trailer, stopping
at Burger King restaurants en route for fruit and vegetable snacks,
but no hamburgers since gorillas are vegetarians. The restaurant
chain sponsored the $10,000, 1{-day-long trip.
   Dr. Mabon Pugh, a Pensacola veterinarian who examined Muke when
she was tranquilized before the move, said the animal appears
normal in every respect, but for some reason has been unable to
breed.
   The Gorilla Species Survival Committee of the American
Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which arranged the match, is
hoping Colossus will be the answer to her dreams.
   Because Colossus has no experience with another gorilla, the two
will be kept in separate indoor quarters while time-sharing a
7,000-foot outdoor enclosure until they show signs of
compatibility. Until then, they will be able to see, smell and
touch each other through the peephole. It isn't big enough,
however, to permit them to grab or hold hands.
   ``He's been a peeping gorilla today,'' Quinn quipped.
   Eventually the plan is to open a door enough for Muke to visit
Colossus, but not enough for him to crawl through, leaving her with
an escape route if necessary.
   Quinn figures he'll be able to tell when they are ready to meet
when they start knocking the paint off the walls. A more subtle
indication, he said, would be the sharing of food.

numbers.
   Several other types of Black & Decker trimmers with the same

   Justice Department officials are reviewing
proposed racketeering and fraud charges against former Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, law enforcement officials
have confirmed.
   Prosecutors are seeking approval from their superiors to bring
indictments alleging a racketeering conspiracy to loot the
Philippines government over two decades and fraud in the way money
was concealed behind false ownerships, officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity told The Associated Press.
   The officials confirmed the proposed charges following a report
Wednesday on the matter on NBC News.
   Federal law enforcement officials said last December that the
U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan was studying whether Marcos
unlawfully acquired some New York real estate and fraudulently
tried to transfer it to Saudi Arabian billionaire Adnan Khashoggi.
   Those sources said the prosecutors also were investigating
whether Marcos and his wife, Imelda, illegally acquired millions of
dollars in jewelry brought into the United States when they fled
the Philippines in 1986.
   The Philippines government is attempting to recover through a
civil suit four Manhattan office buildings worth an estimated $326
million. The suit alleges they were acquired with misappropriated
Philippines funds.
   The Marcoses have denied any wrongdoing in connection with the
New York real estate or with property they brought with them when
they left the Philippines for exile in Hawaii.

<HEAD>Talk Show With Drug Trafficker Prompts Government To Close TV And
Radio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government closed a TV station and a
radio station after they ran an interview with a major drug dealer
who said the U.S. State Department and Bolivia traffic narcotics.
   Carlos Palenque, owner of Channel Four and Radio Metropolitana
in the Bolivian capital, said he will begin a hunger strike to
oppose the one-year ban imposed Wednesday.
   Palenque interviewed convicted cocaine trafficker Roberto Suarez
Gomez, his son, and three other guests on a talk show last week.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says Suarez Gomez is one of the
top cocaine traffickers in Bolivia.
   In the show, Suarez Gomez said the U.S. State Department was the
``king of cocaine.''
   ``The vice royalty is the government of Bolivia and the
president is a boss at the service of the U.S. government,'' he
said.
   On Monday, the country's conservative government announced it
would close the stations for a year and said President Victor Paz
Esstensoro and the government were slandered. The government also
ordered the arrest of participants in the show.
   Despite congressional approval of the act, several legislators
expressed concern over the precedent of closing a station through
government edict instead of through the courts.
   The Association of La Paz journalists issued a statement saying
``we strongly condemn the local media for having offered an apology
for criminal behavior in violation of legal codes of conduct for
journalists.''
   Channel Four and Radio Metropolitana have a wide audience among
residents of poor La Paz neighborhoods and in rural areas. Palenque
also publishes a magazine that depicts acts of violence, rape and
murder.
   Three of the five guests on the talk show appeared earlier in a
videotaped meeting with Suarez Gomez at his Santa Cruz home and
nearby ranch. The tape also showed a meeting between Suarez Gomez
and Congressman Alfredo Arce Carpio and retired Gen. Mario Vargas
Salinas.
   The tapes led to a heated political debate in Bolivia, with
accusations that those who met with Suarez Gomez were soliciting
funds for political campaigns.
   Arce Carpio, who took a leave of absence from Congress after the
tapes were shown, says he met with Suarez Gomez to arrange a
newspaper interview and denies any wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   A woman who was raped, stabbed 15 times,
choked and left for dead struggled through desolate countryside
nearly 24 hours before she was rescued, and then helped catch the
suspect, authorities said.
   ``She is one tremendous lady,'' Lewis and Clark County Sheriff
Chuck O'Reilly said Wednesday after the suspect appeared in court.
``This gal has ... courage.''
   The 29-year-old Helena woman disappeared from her home about
1:30 a.m. Saturday. She had been talking on the telephone with a
friend, who heard the woman cry ``Oh no! Oh no!,'' authorities said.
   The friend reported hearing sounds of a scuffle, and when police
arrived at the home, she was missing.
   She turned up a day later on a country road northeast of Helena,
where a motorist picked her up and took her to a hospital,
authorities said.
   Despite her condition, she insisted on giving officers a
detailed description of her assailant, O'Reilly said.
   ``Her description was remarkable,'' he said. ``She was trying so
hard to help us in the midst of all that pain, sedation and
terror.''
   The description played a key role in the arrest. Authorities
said they were able to identify the suspect with help from a fellow
employee who heard the description on the radio.
   Shawn D. Clawson, 24, of Helena, was arrested Tuesday night on a
rural road 10 miles east of Helena, authorities said. He was
charged Wednesday with attempted murder, aggravated kidnapping,
rape and aggravated assault, and was being held in lieu of $250,000
bail.
   Clawson was paroled in March from the Montana State Prison,
where he served part of a 10-year sentence for burglary, sexual
assault and intimidation charges filed in Anaconda, O'Reilly said.
   On Saturday, authorities said, Clawson broke into the woman's
home through a bedroom window. He held her for several hours in an
abandoned bus three blocks away, then took her to a remote area
northeast of Helena, where he raped her, stabbed her 15 times, beat
her about the head with a rock and left her for dead in the hilly,
rugged area, police said.
   She made her way through the arid countryside dotted with trees
and sagebrush for about 24 hours before she reached the road where
she was found, authorities said. O'Reilly said he did not know how
far she traveled.
   The woman underwent surgery at a Helena hospital Sunday and was
in stable condition Wednesday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Greg Painter, who hired Clawson to work at a Helena auto-parts
store in April, said Clawson seemed calm Saturday morning at work,
but that he suddenly left Tuesday.
   An employee who heard a description of the assailant on the
radio told Painter about the resemblance to Clawson, and Painter
said he called the sheriff's office.
   Clawson was arrested minutes later as he was driving to Canyon
Ferry Lake with his 17-year-old girlfriend, authorities said.
   ``You'd never expect it,'' Painter said of Clawson's arrest.
``It really bothers me. I don't know what made him tick upstairs.''
   Authorities said that an hour before the abduction, the woman
had telephoned her husband, who was away in Moscow, Idaho, and told
him of several troubling phone calls she had just received.
   They also said the suspect had stopped at the woman's home last
week to inquire about a ``For Sale'' sign. The woman referred him
to a real estate company, authorities said.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After watching his half-acre of grass wither
and dry this spring, Witham Smith wrote a letter to the ``Old
Farmer's Almanac.''
   Smith, a regular reader of the almanac, asked whether the
196-year-old publication's forecasters, having missed the Midwest's
drought, could at least predict the dry spell's end.
   He received a pretty dry answer from Judson D. Hale Sr., editor
of the almanac.
   ``We didn't predict that it was coming and we can't predict when
it will end,'' Hale wrote Smith, who lives in suburban Terrace Park.
   The almanac claims to be 80 percent accurate, but Hale
acknowledged that it doesn't predict weather for spring and summer
too well.
   This year, it predicted that it would be warmer and wetter than
normal in the Greater Ohio Valley. Heavy rain was predicted for
June 14 to 17.
   The almanac usually gathers statistics for its predictions six
to 18 months in advance. The predictions are based on such
information as changes in sun spots, the size of polar ice caps,
and the location of warm water currents.
   ``Our 1989 edition will be published in November. It is really
hard to nail down the weather for spring and summer that far in
advance because so many things happen,'' Hale said.
   ``They have been a little off before, but never this far,''
Smith said. ``They said we would be about half an inch off, but not
a drought like this.''

<TEXT>
   Senior Labor Party legislator Abba Eban,
a founding father of the Jewish state and its leading spokesman for
years, has been ousted from Israeli politics after a generation in
its vanguard.
   The 73-year-old Eban, a former deputy prime minister and foreign
minister, failed in his bid Wednesday to win a slot on the party
slate for the November elections to the Israeli Parliament.
   Under the Israeli system, each party makes a list of people to
fill the seats it wins in the 120-member Knesset. The number of
seats assigned to a party depends on its total vote.
   After the Labor Party vote, Eban wrote to party leader and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres: ``For a generation I carried (the
party's) flag and stated its case throughout the country and the
world, and many listened to me.
   ``It's clear I cannot keep carrying the flag as I did in the
past because the party leadership took away my right to do so.''
   Eban said he would now dedicate his time to writing books and
participating in a television series on Israel's history.
   The tall, portly Eban is known for his sophisticated oratory,
and Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, once described
him as ``the voice of the Hebrew nation.''
   In his 40-year political career, Eban also served as Israel's
ambassador to the United States and the United Nations.
   Referring to his appeal abroad, Eban once said: ``I could have
been elected prime minister if people abroad could vote in Israeli
elections.''
   In domestic party politics, Eban never played a central role,
partially because his upper-class mannerisms and love of academia
set him apart from many of his colleagues.
   Since 1984, Eban has served as chairman of Parliament's Defense
and Foreign Affairs Committee, a position of influence but with
little direct power.
   Eban was born Feb. 2, 1915, in Capetown, South Africa, and his
family moved to England when he was a child. He attended Queens'
College Cambridge, where he received first class honors in
classics, Hebrew, and Arabic and Persian.
   During World War II, he joined the British army. When the war
ended, he joined the Jewish Agency Political Department, the
forerunner of Israel's Foreign Ministry, and was sent to the United
Nations to help fight for a Jewish state.
   His skill as a speaker was instrumental in persuading the United
Nations to pass the Nov. 29, 1947 Palestine partition resolution
that granted the Jews a homeland. Israel was declared a state a
year later.
   Eban's ouster Wednesday was in part an apparent payback for his
criticism of party leaders for the Jonathan Jay Pollard spy case.
   Pollard, a 33-year-old American Jew, was sentenced to life in
prison in March 1987 for selling classified U.S. military documents
to Israel.
   Eban made waves in the party last year when a Knesset
investigating committee he headed blamed Peres and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, a party member, for not supervising those involved
in the Pollard operation.
   Peres was prime minister when Pollard was working for Israel.

<TEXT>
   The outlawed Communist Party departed from its
previous radical stance and said it will participate in a
presidential election in which the only candidate will be nominated
by the military.
   The Communists were until now the only major opposition group
refusing to participate. They had called for ``all forms of
struggle,'' including violence, to put an end to the military
regime of President Augusto Pinochet.
   The Party's Central Committee said Wednesday that the new
position was prompted by ``a new social-political picture in the
country'' resulting from the opposition's ``social mobilization and
intense political battle.''
   But Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democratic leader, said the
Communists still will remain excluded from a group of 14 moderate
opposition parties united for the vote.
   According to the 1980 military-drafted Constitution, the
election will take place at an unspecified date later this year or
early 1989.
   Citizens will only be able to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on a
candidate to be nominated by the commanders of the three armed
services and the head of the national police.
   Pinochet, 72, who has ruled since a 1973 coup, is considered the
most likely candidate.
   Four Communist leaders said at a news conference that they still
think the government will try to win the plebiscite fraudulently
and called for labor unrest and street demonstrations.
   Jose Sanfuentes, a party leader, said, ``The victory of the `no'
in the plebiscite should mean an immediate end to the dictatorship
and its fascist legislation.'' He said it should lead to a
``transitional democratic government'' to call an early competitive
presidential election.
   The moderate opposition says a ``no'' victory should be followed
by negotiations with the military to ensure a peaceful and orderly
transition to full democracy.
   But the government insists that whatever the vote upcome, the
Constitution will remain unchanged. That means if the
military-picked candidate is rejected, Pinochet would remain in
office for an extra year, until 1990, when an open election would
be called.

   Ito-Yokado Co., a major Japanese supermarket

   ``The decision not to deal in South African products was made in
view of the growing criticism in and outside the company'' of South
Africa's policy of racial segregation, said supermarket spokesman
Yasuo Takaha.
   Sales of canned yellow peaches and canned fruit cocktail

   Takaha said the decision was made during a company meeting in

He said the products have been replaced with similar items from the

<HEAD>Government Attacks Foreign Reports On Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chinese police today accused the foreign media of
``sheer fabrications'' in reporting a student sit-in. It was the
second attack in a week on foreign accounts of student unrest.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Wang Jingrong, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Public Security, as saying foreign
journalists reported students were arrested or beaten by police at
sit-in Friday on academic issues.
   ``Such stories in some foreign media are sheer fabrications,''
Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.
   He confirmed that police broke up the protest outside
Zhongnanhai in Beijing, a walled compound that houses party
headquarters and residences for top leaders. The students were from
Changchun in northeast China's Jilin province.
   But in a telephone interview, Wang refused to give details of
how the protest was broken up.
   No Western reporters saw the brief sit-in. The French news
agency Agence France-Presse quoted a witness as saying police led
away about 60 protesters, and said police later confirmed the
students were taken away.
   But AFP said it did not report any police beatings of the
students, and the target of Wang's criticism was not immediately
clear.
   Last week, Xinhua accused the U.S. government Voice of America
radio of falsely reporting a student was arrested in a separate
sit-in June 8. VOA denied the charge, and said it only reported
that one person was led away by police.
   That sit-in involved about a dozen Beijing University students
who were trying to hold a pro-democracy protest in central
Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of students had rallied on
campus and planned a march to the square, but police cordoned it
off and no march was held.
   The protest Friday involved students who attended an
unaccredited ``special training course'' in Changchun and wanted
government accreditation for their diplomas, the official China
Daily said.
   It quoted Wang as saying police stopped the sit-in because ``the
students violated the rules for maintaining social order by
interfering in the work of the government.''
   The incident prompted a State Education Commission announcement
Tuesday calling for a crackdown on unauthorized schools and
training classes that lack official accreditation.
   A growing number of such classes have been set up privately and
by work units in recent years, generally to teach English and
technical subjects, because of a shortage of places in accredited
schools. But their certificates or degrees are not recognized by
would-be employers.
   Officials have made it clear they will not tolerate a repeat of
the massive student protests of the winter of 1986-87, when
thousands of students in Beijing and other major cities marched
through the streets to demand democracy and freedom.
   Those protests ended with a crackdown on Western-style
liberalism and the ouster by conservatives of Communist Party chief
Hu Yaobang for failing to halt the protests quickly enough.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Leslie Manigat has
rejected the transfers of several high-ranking army officers,
publicly challenging for the first time the powerful military
command that ensured his election.
   The apparent power struggle began when Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy,
head of the three-man junta that ran Haiti until Manigat's election
in January, ordered the transfers or retirements.
   Manigat on Wednesday overruled the orders, claiming they were
unconstitutional since he had not been consulted.
   On Wednesday night, the Army General Staff issued a statement
pledging loyalty to Manigat and delaying the transfer orders.
   ``It has been decided after a meeting with ... the president and
the minister of defense to temporarily put off the above mentioned
steps,'' said the statement, broadcast on the private Radio Haiti
Inter.
   ``The transfer and retirement of certain high-ranking officers
and other officers decided Tuesday morning by the
commander-in-chief'' had been rescinded to ``avoid a major
crisis,'' said the statement from the national palace read on local
radio stations.
   It was unclear whether Manigat had prevailed.
   ``The situation is grave,'' said a Western diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Either the general submits to Manigat's
ultimatum, or there will be a stand-off between the government and
the army. There is fear of a clash.''
   One of the officers Namphy tried to reassign is Col. Jean-Claude
Paul, who heads the widely-feared Dessalines Battalion and was
indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges in March.
   Haiti Inter, quoting an unidentified military source, said
Namphy ordered Paul relieved of his command of the 700-man
battalion and named assistant chief of staff, a largely
administrative position.
   Soldiers under Paul's command have been blamed for widespread
violence against voters that forced the cancellation of last
November's independently adminstrated general elections and left
more than 30 people dead.
   Manigat, the army's candidate in the Jan. 17 junta-run
elections, has always claimed that he could govern independent of
the army, which has controlled Haiti during most of its 184-year
history.
   A government spokeswoman said Wednesday that everyone was
waiting to see what would happen.
   ``This is certainly a moment of crisis,'' said Anaise Chavenet,
spokeswoman for the Ministry of Information.
   Manigat scheduled a news conference for this morning.
   The army's statement, signed by General Secretary of the General
Staff Col. Gary Leon also said the high command reaffirmed its
``unreserved loyalty to the government of the state within the
framework of constitutional and legal provisions.''
   Namphy was head of the three-man junta that ruled Haiti for two
years after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in France
in February 1986.
   Manigat, a former political science professor, was elected in
army-supervised balloting that was boycotted by the opposition that
foreign observers said was fraught with fraud.
   The United States cut off most of its aid to Haiti after the
aborted November balloting.
   Paul was indicted in March by a grand jury in Miami on charges
of conspiring to import 220 pounds of cocaine into the United
States from Latin America in December 1986. He has denied the
charges.
   Last week, Foreign Minister Gerard Latortue said in Washington
D.C, that his government is ready to open an investigation into
Paul's alleged drug connection as soon as it officially receives
the evidence from the United States.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said details of the charges
were delivered to Haitian authorities last week.
   Manigat, a Social Democrat considered right-of-center and
staunchly anti-communist, has done little to alleviate Haiti's most
pressing problems.
   Haiti, which a population of 6 million, is the poorest country
in the Western Hemisphere. It shares the island of Hispaniola with
the Dominican Republic.

<HEAD>Court Told That U.S. Secrets Intended For Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian who lived for a time
in Hungary has been charged with espionage for allegedly gathering
secrets about U.S. submarine-monitoring operations for the Soviet
Union.
   Stephen Joseph Ratkai, 25, a native of Nova Scotia, was charged
with three counts of espionage under Canada's Official Secrets Act
during an appearance in St. John's provincial court on Wednesday.
   Officials have not said whether any information was actually
passed to the Soviets.
   Ratkai was ordered held without bail until June 28. He did not
have to enter a plea.
   The suspect said nothing when reporters shouted out questions as
he left the courthouse.
   Ratkai was accused of gathering classified U.S. military
documents about the U.S. Navy's submarine-tracking base in the
Argentia naval base during 1987 and 1988.
   The documents were intended for a foreign power, ``namely the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,'' the charges said.
   Ratkai was arrested last Saturday in St. John's following a
2{-year investigation by the Canadian Security Intelligence
Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the U.S. Naval
Investigative Service.
   Argentia base, on Newfoundland's foggy south coast, keeps an eye
on Soviet submarines by monitoring a network of underwater
listening devices in the North Atlantic near Greenland, Iceland and
Britain. The base is jointly operated by up to 400 U.S. military
personnel and 70 Canadians.
   The base commander, Capt. Brooks Chesser, said Tuesday that a
member of the base staff cooperated with Canadian security agents
in investigating Ratkai.
   Chesser would not say whether Ratkai approached the base member
to seek classified documents or whether he was given doctored
documents to pass to the Soviets.
   Ratkai's mother came from Nova Scotia. His father was a
Hungarian who emigrated to Canada after the Soviet Union cracked
down on an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956.
   After his mother committed suicide Ratkai lived in Hungary for a
while as a child. Later he returned to Canada.
   In 1983, he moved back to Hungary before again moving back to
Canada.
   Ratkai was the fourth person charged under Canada's Official
Secrets Act since 1950. Only one of the four has been convicted.
   That was in January 1986, when former Royal Canadian Mounted
Police officer James Morrison pleaded guilty to having passed
secrets to the Soviets in 1955. He was sentenced to 18 months in
jail.

   A Navy satellite
designed to help sailors pinpoint their locations at sea was
launched into orbit, officials said today.
   The 383-pound NOVA 2 navigational satellite was boosted into
outer space at shortly before midnight Wednesday, said base

   ``We had a successful launch, and everything looks good so
far,'' Sullivan said.
   The launch of the satellite aboard a 73-foot Scout rocket was
the first space launching from the Air Force base since April 26.

   The Soviet Union is allowing Voice of America,
the U.S. government's radio service, to open its first Moscow
bureau.
   U.S. officials said Wednesday that Soviet authorities have
agreed informally to the request, which was made a year ago and
renewed in informal talks at the recent summit in Moscow.
   ``Soviet authorities have indicated informally that they will
soon respond positively to VOA's request to open a Moscow bureau,''
said Beth Knisley, a spokeswoman for the radio service.
   The bureau would be VOA's first in Moscow and the service hopes
to have it set up and ready for broadcasting in three months, she
said.
   The Soviets, under the glasnost _ or openness _ policies of
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, have recently opened more doors to VOA
and stopped jamming VOA broadcasts to the Soviet Union last year.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is
recalling 24,000 electric mouse traps they say are dangerous to
humans as well as to mice.
   ``Consumers should stop the use of these items immediately,''
the commission said in ordering the recall on Wednesday.
   The agency said it determined the people might get shocked by
exposed electrodes near the bait container, although no incidents
of electric shocks or injuries have occurred.
   The traps were sold throughout the country by catalog companies,
including Pennsylvania-based Hanover House Industries, Inc. for
$9.95. Hanover House will give mousetrap buyers $10 credit toward
purchase of other merchandise when they return the traps and refund
return mailing costs.
   Consumers can call Hanover House at 800-621-5800.

   GEORGE BUSH, speaking Thursday about the drought in the midwest:
``While it is too early to fully assess any damage from the
drought, without rain there is the potential for this to be a
catastrophe ... Sad to say, nothing will take the place of
rainfall, and we have to be concerned about the plight of the
nation's farmers.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, on prospects for floor fights at the Democratic
National Convention over issues important to his campaign:
``Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. ... If you lose you will
at least have left your imprint.''
   
   REP. CHARLES RANGEL, D-N.Y., urging strong consideration for
Jesse Jackson as the Democrats' vice presidential nominee: ``We
come in with a candidate. ... It seems to me that Governor Dukakis
has to come up with a better candidate, or at least be prepared to
share with us why he does not believe that Reverend Jackson is the
best candidate.''
   
   LESLIE DACH, Michael Dukakis' spokesman, on the Democrat's plans
to campaign in the South: ``Mike Dukakis knows he can win states in
the South and he's going to campaign actively there. While George
Bush has a lot of homes, he has no secure political base and he's
going to have to campaign everywhere.''

<TEXT>
   People lacking commitment to Jesus
will be consigned to hell, Southern Baptists declared, while
moderates marched to the Alamo and tore up a resolution they said
meant a denominational dictatorship.
   ``Some believe that hell is not a reality, and its corollary,
that all people will eventually be saved,'' said a resolution
approved Wednesday by the nation's largest Protestant denomination
at its annual convention.
   ``We affirm our belief in the biblical truth that those without
a personal commitment to Jesus Christ will be consigned to a
literal hell, the place of everlasting separation from God.''
   Being saved from it ``comes only by repentence, regeneration
through faith in Jesus Christ,'' the resolution said. ``No one is
saved apart from that transforming experience.''
   The resolution, approved overwhelmingly, represents no change in
doctrine by the 14.7 million-member denomination. But it was
unusual since the subject of hell is rarely discussed in most
mainstream pulpits or by church conventions because so little is
concluded about it.
   It also seemed to reflect the fundamentalist position that
non-Christians must be brought to Christ or be condemned to hell, a
thesis that has not been advanced by mainline churches in modern
times.
   A regional interfaith director for the Southern Baptist missions
board in New Jersey was ousted earlier this year by fundamentalist
pressure because he held that God's covenant with Jews remains
permanent and valid.
   Fundamentalists have held the presidency of the Southern Baptist
Convention for nine years. They maintained their grip with the
election Tuesday of another fundamentalist, the Rev. Jerry Vines of
Jacksonville, Fla., who narrowly defeated the moderate candidate,
the Rev. Richard Jackson of Phoenix, Ariz., for the one-year term.
   Through presidential appointive powers, fundamentalists have
brought the vast network of denominational operations under their
control.
   The resolution was one of several approved as the annual meeting
of 32,600 ``messengers,'' as the delegates are known, neared its
close today.
   With the fundamentalist wing predominating, the convention also
limited the historic Protestant concept of the equality of laity
and clergy.
   That view, expressed in the phrase ``priesthood of the
believer,'' was a key concept of the 16th century Reformation,
which rejected the clerical domination in the Roman Catholic Church.
   The convention said the concept ``in no way contradicts'' the
``authority of the pastor which is seen in the command to the local
church in Hebrews 13:17, `Obey your leaders, and submit to them.' ''
   After the resolution was approved by a two-thirds vote sharply
divided between moderates and fundamentalists, about 200 moderates
staged a protest march to the Alamo, the cradle of Texas liberty.
   There they ripped up copies of the resolution and denounced it
as heresy and a betrayal of Protestant heritage.
   ``This cuts at the soul of what Baptist congregations are all
about,'' said the Rev. Randall Lolley, driven from the presidency
of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary by
fundamenalist-imposed controls on choosing faculty.
   The resolution states that ``misunderstanding and abuse'' of the
egalitarian doctrine has led to a mistaken attitude that a
``Christian may believe what he so chooses and still be considered
a loyal Southern Baptist.''
   It also has been used in ``undermining of pastoral authority,''
but does not contravene the ``responsibility and authority of the
pastor,'' the resolution said.
   Moderates shouted from the floor during the tumultuous debate
that the resolution was akin to a ``papal system'' of clerical
control and violated Jesus' teaching that ministers were to be
servants, not masters.
   ``What it's talking about is denominational dictatorship,'' said
the Rev. Buckner Fanning of San Antonio. ``It says the only way to
lead is by blind obedience.''

   A prominent journalist has proposed radically
altering Soviet politics so the people elect their chief executive
by secret ballot and power is transferred from the Communist Party
to the government.
   Fyodor Burlatsky calls for the changes in this week's edition of
the literary newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   He says the Soviet Union's parliament, the Supreme Soviet,
should be given broad powers, including the right to allocate the
budget and impeach the president. The body now merely ratifies the
Communist leadership's decisions.
   The main thesis of Burlatsky, a former Kremlin adviser and
prominent Soviet political thinker, is that the government should
be strengthened to the detriment of the party, which now holds a
monopoly on political power.
   ``Russia had some elements of democracy before, but never had
liberal traditions ... the freedom of an individual from
interference by the state,'' Burlatsky wrote. ``Russia never had
any notion about basic human rights.''
   The far-reaching article in the weekly newspaper of the Writers'
Union is one of the most radical critiques of the system yet to
appear under the auspices of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
liberalization.
   Burlatsky expands on points included in proposals to be
discussed at an extraordinariy Communist Party conference that
begins June 28.
   He says the country's leader should be elected ``by direct and
secret ballot by all the people'' rather than in a meeting of the
Politburo of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   Burlatsky suggests a candidate should first attain the post of
party general secretary, now the highest Soviet office, then run
for president.
   He does not say if more than one candidate should be allowed to
run for each office. The writer also calls for the creation of the
post of vice president.
   Supporters of the Gorbachev reforms say their efforts are
hampered by conservative officials in the party and government who
stand to lose power and privilege.
   Conservatives blocked Burlatsky and other outspoken reformers
from being included among the 5,000 delegates to the party
conference. The conference can debate and set party policy, but is
not expected to make leadership changes.
   Burlatsky is vice presdident of the Soviet Political Science
Association and a regular contributor to Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   He first gained prominence as an adviser to Nikita Khrushchev,
who was ousted as Soviet leader in 1964 by a group which included
Leonid I. Brezhnev, who lead the Soviet Union until his death in
1982.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at a new
record high Thursday, while the dollar lost ground in trading
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the day's session at
28,147.32 points, up 53.80 points or 0.19 percent, surpassing its
previous record reached Wednesday, when the index gained 31.72
points.
   After opening the day lower at 126.22 yen, the dollar edeged
down further and closed at 125.98 yen, down 0.34 yen.
   ``The market is carrying on Wednesday's strength, which was
fueled by an overnight advance on Wall Street,'' said an official
of a major securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On Wednesday, Tokyo's main economic barometer posted a record
28,093.52-point close, surpassing the previous closing high of
28,072.02 of last Thursday.
   The securities firm official said the market's buying mood
remained strong, and said activity in non-ferrous metals issues was
the key force behind the Nikkei rise early Wednesday.
   The dollar opened at 126.22 yen, down from Wednesday's close of
126.32 yen, and was trading at the 126.14-yen level by midmorning.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said the
dollar ``has stayed at a high level'' following the release of
figures Tuesday showing the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for
April was much lower than expected.
   Financial markets have reacted strongly in recent months to U.S.
trade figures which are seen as providing signals for the likely
direction of stocks and the dollar.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Kill American, Peruvian Agronomists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas shot and killed a U.S.
agricultural adviser and his Peruvian colleague, then wrote in red
ink in the American's notebook, ``This is the way the lackeys of
Yankee imperialism die.''
   Constantine Orson Gregory, 25, of Los Angeles, and Gustavo
Rojas, 35, of Lima, were killed Monday on an isolated road in the
central Andes Mountains, said police Col. Cirilo Pacheco.
   Pacheco said Wednesday that three Shining Path guerrillas halted
the agronomists' pickup truck, checked their papers and then shot
each man twice in the back of the head.
   The attackers dynamited the agronomists' truck and escaped, and
30 suspects have been arrested in sweeps of the region, he said.
   The two men and Gregory's American wife, who is expecting a
baby, were living in Aramachay, a hamlet without electricity or
piped water 15 miles north of Huancayo, a major city 125 miles east
of Lima, said officials of the National Agrarian Research Institute.
   Gregory's wife, Dolores, was not in the truck.
   Last Thursday, pro-Cuban guerrillas lobbed three mortar rounds
at the residence of U.S. Ambassador Alexander Watson in Lima,
causing minor damage and no injuries.
   In another attack Tuesday, a column of Shining Path rebels
swarmed into Huallay village in the highland state of Ayacucho,
killing 14 peasants who belonged to a civil defense patrol
organized by the army, police said.
   The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday that Gregory and Rojas were
teaching peasant farmers methods to improve production of sheep and
small farm animals.
   The Shining Path, an eight-year-old Maoist insurgency,
frequently assassinates development workers in Peru's impoverished
highlands in an effort to sow economic chaos.
   Gregory had been working on the project only a few months and
was preparing to return to the United States in August to pursue a
doctoral degree, said a U.S. development official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The embassy said the men worked for the institute on a project
funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development near
Huancayo.
   They were traveling from Aramachay to buy supplies in the town
of Sincos five miles away when the attack occurred, said institute
spokesman Javier Recuenco.
   In the only other U.S. death linked to the guerrilla war, a
Texas woman was among seven passengers killed and 28 wounded when
guerrillas bombed a tourist train heading for the Inca ruins of
Machu Picchu in June 1986.
   AID has about 20 Americans in Peru and employs dozens of other
U.S. and Peruvian citizens under contract agreements, the Lima AID
office said. The agency spends more than $50 million yearly on
agriculture, health and food relief programs, officials said.
   The Shining Path guerrillas launched their insurgency in
Ayacucho state. Although the Andes remain their stronghold, the
violence has spread through much of the country.
   The government says more than 10,000 people have been slain in
the rebels' drive to impose a Marxist state.

   The Tokyo stock market's key indicator set another
record high closing today for the second consecutive trading day,
while the U.S. dollar weakened in trading against the Japanese yen.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues added 53.80 points, or 0.19 percent, to close the day's
session at 28,147.32. It surpassed the previous record reached a
day earlier, when the index rose 31.72 points.
   ``Share prices drifted lower on profit-taking selling in the
afternoon, mainly in export-related issues,'' said an official with
a major Tokyo securities firm.
   The Nikkei index had closed the morning session higher at
28,214.52, up 121.00 points.
   The market was led by large-capital steels and metal issues, the
brokerage official added.
   Trading was moderate, with volume in the first section reaching
an estimated 1.4 billion shares, down from 2.5 billion shares
Wednesday.
   Advancing issues included machineries, chemicals and papers.
Constructions, housings, drugs and financials were lower.
   The dollar ranged between 125.98 yen and 126.25 yen before
closing at 125.98 yen, the day's low, down 0.34 yen from
Wednesday's finish.
   The dollar maintained strength in the morning, but weakened
during afternoon trading because high Japanese gross national
product figures for January to March 1987 were expected to be
released later today, said a foreign exchange dealer, speaking
anonymously.
   ``Participants anticipating higher GNP went on buying yen and
selling dollars,'' he said.

   Despite declining membership and financial
shortfalls, the nation's largest Presbyterian denomination is
healthy and ready to become a major force, says the man in charge
of the church's $98 million mission budget.
   S. David Stoner, executive director of the General Assembly
Council of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), said finances have
been worrisome for some time in the 3-million-member church.
   The denomination Wednesday concluded its nine-day annual meeting
after approving a $108.7 million budget that includes a $5.1
million deficit. Stoner said the church's 11,600 congregations
would be challenged to make up the shortfall.
   Budget concerns surfaced frequently during the 200th annual
meeting. Stoner said much of the problem stems from continuing
efforts to merge two Presbyterian groups.
   The United Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) joined with the smaller,
mainly Southern, Presbyterian Church (U.S.) five years ago, ending
a 121-year-old split stemming from the Civil War.
   ``This was the first real assembly of the new denomination,'' he
said, and decisions in St. Louis provide ``a stage for true vigor.
We are going to be able to build together.''
   Stoner said the assembly's actions would help set priorities for
the General Assembly Council as it goes about allocating the money
among competing interests.
   The revisions and final adoption Tuesday of ``Christian
Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' a major policy statement that has
been blamed for some divisiveness in the church, will help heal
those splits, Stoner and others said.
   The Rev. Harry Hassell, an associate pastor at the
denomination's largest church, Highland Park in Dallas, and an
original opponent of the Christian Obedience paper, said he was
elated by the final product, which was reworded to make it clear
civil disobedience or tax resistance by those opposed to government
policies were unusual courses for Christians.
   ``For the first time in a long while, we have a perspective in
the broad middle,'' Hassell said.
   The paper says nuclear war is immoral and the theory of nuclear
deterrence ``as an adequate, permanent means to national security
... is not morally defensible.''
   It says civil disobedience is justifiable ``in certain
circumstances,'' and the church should at least emotionally support
its members who make that decision.
   In other actions during the assembly, the denomination:
   _Voted for a new study of the denomination's pro-choice stance
on abortion. Anti-abortion groups narrowly persuaded the assembly
to review the 3-year-old policy.
   _Condemned Israel's ``repressive'' handling of Palestinian
uprisings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, calling for the nation
to end its occupation of the territories and for the United States
and Israel to participate in a United Nations-sponsored
international peace conference.
   _Adopted a wide-ranging statement on religious liberty, saying
government increasingly is intruding on church affairs.
   _Declared that ``every person should have affordable, quality
health services,'' and supported the adoption of a national health
standard of adequate health care by 1990.
   _Re-elected the Rev. James E. Andrews as stated clerk, the
church's top constitutional officer.
   _Approved the consolidation of the church pension board's
headquarters in Philadelphia.

<HEAD>Democratic Committee To Meet June 24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Platform Drafting Committee
will meet again in Denver on June 24, on the eve of a two-day
meeting of the full platform committee.
   The 16-member drafting committee, chaired by Rep. William Gray
III of Pennsylvania, spent three days at Mackinac Island, Mich.,
last weekend hammering out working papers on key issues.
   Gray promised the participants Sunday they would get a chance to
vote on a draft platform sometime before the full 186-member panel
takes up the document June 25-26 and the new meeting was announced
on Wednesday.
   Supporters of Michael Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic
nominee, and presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson were divided over
whether the platform should call for a freeze on Pentagon spending
and a tax increase on the wealthy.
   Jackson has enough delegates to force floor fights on any issues
he chooses at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. The
convention will take up the platform on July 19, its second night.

<HEAD>Democrats Plans to Serve Bologna at Bush's Houston Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Texas Democrats are planning to serve
bologna to fellow party members in the hotel suite that Vice
President George Bush lists as his legal residence.
   Democratic National Committee member Billie Carr and party
activist Ty Fain have rented the Houstonian Hotel suite that Bush
cites as his legal address.
   ``It's baloney for him to claim his residence is Texas,'' Carr
said.
   To illustrate their opinion, the two plan to serve bologna at
the suite to fellow Democrats Friday for the beginning of the Texas
Democratic Convention.
   Bush, who has wrapped up the GOP presidential nomination, lived
in Texas for years but hasn't owned a local residence since
becoming vice president in 1981. He was born in Massachusetts, grew
up in Connecticut, has a vacation home in Maine and votes in
Houston.

   Simon Says Bush Has ``Credibility Problem'' on Education
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon says Vice President George
Bush's education proposals are ``cotton candy'' for schools that
need ``meat and potatoes.''
   Simon, an Illinois who lost his bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination, said Wednesday that Bush's ideas ``lack
vision about what has to be done to bring a first-rate education to
every American child.''
   Bush on Tuesday unveiled $600 million in new or expanded
education programs, including a $500 million National Merit Schools
plan that would furnish $100,000 awards to schools that make
strides in educating the disadvantaged.
   But Simon said Bush's statement that he wants to be the
``education president'' sounds like ``an election-year conversion.''
   ``After eight years of not lifting one finger while the White
House'' was seeking deep cuts in education, Simon said, ``Mr. Bush
has a great credibility problem with the claim that he intends to
be `the education president.'''

   Bert Lance, an adviser to presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson, says party unity will determine whether
the Democrats recapture the White House in November.
   The former budget director under President Carter told an
Atlanta audience Wednesday that the unity depends on Jackson acting
responsibly at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta July
18-21.
   ``Let's face it,'' Lance said. ``Jesse Jackson's future is with
the Democrats. It's not with the Republicans and it's not as a
half-warm participant. It's in full participation.
   ``There's no reason to think it's not going to be that way,''
Lance said. ``He's going to campaign for the ticket. He's going to
be responsible, he's going to be substantive.''

   Bob Landecker wasn't going to let
chicken pox keep him from the first day of his new job _ not after
what he went through to get it.
   Landecker was hired Monday by radio station KKSU after he spent
the day sitting on Main Street with a sign reading, ``Hi Hutch. I
am Bob Landecker. I need a job.''
   Cliff Shank, who needed a program director and afternoon
announcer for KKSU, was intrigued.
   ``I stopped by to talk with him,'' Shank said. ``Anyone who has
got the gumption to do that might be someone worth looking at.''
   Landecker went on the air Tuesday despite having chicken pox.
   ``I started breaking out right before my first show,'' said
Landecker, who worked in a secluded room.
   Landecker said he once worked for a public relations company in
Ponca City, Okla. But he said he got the idea to advertise for a
job from a radio announcer in Tulsa who rented a billboard and
received several offers.

   Only hours after he clanged and chimed his
way to his ninth victory in the 25th annual Cable Car Bell Ringing
Competition, Carl Payne already was thinking about next year's
contest.
   ``I have to be constantly thinking of something that's catchy, a
little different,'' the 47-year-old cable car gripman said
Wednesday.
   Payne, who has been at the controls _ and the bell _ of a cable
car for the past two decades, says he is serious about his
bell-ringing art, in which he combines popular songs, everyday
sounds and his own fanciful rhythms.
   On Wednesday, Payne's inventiveness and skill led to victory
against five other gripmen and conductors on the city's cable car
system. The six finalists were chosen from about 30 contestants in
last week's preliminary ``ringoff.''
   While Payne thinks highly of his colleagues, he had special
praise for the winner of the amateur category _ 15-year-old David
Fillippone of Moraga.
   David clanged out a medley of ``Camptown Races'' and ``Good King
Wenceslaus.''
   ``The boy has a lot of talent, a lot of potential for ringing
the bell, Payne said.

   Florida Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul
for the first time experienced the thrill of victory at her own
kind of game.
   Although barred by law from playing the Florida lottery, she is
free to play in other states. She returned Tuesday from a visit to
Illinois with a winning ticket worth $174 from that state's lottery.
   ``It's funny how excited I got; $174 and I won the lottery!''
Mrs. Paul said Wednesday after a meeting of the Florida Lottery
Commission where she revealed her good fortune.
   ``I know this sounds silly,'' she said. ``I've been in this
industry about three years, and it's the first time I've really
experienced the excitement the lottery's about.''
   Mrs. Paul, the director of the Illinois lottery before taking
the Florida job last year, spent $2 on Illinois Cash 5 tickets in
Springfield while visiting her husband, Terry Paul, who still
resides there.
   Mrs. Paul said she matched four of the five winning numbers
drawn Monday night by using her birthday, her husband's birthday
and her ``lucky number,'' 14.
   ``My husband yelled at me for not getting the fifth number
right,'' she said with a smile. ``I said, `It's your fault. It's
your birthday I missed on.'''

<HEAD>Minister Quits Post To Make Kansas City `Courtesy Capital'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minister became so frustrated at
drivers not using turn signals that he resigned his post to launch
a campaign to have Kansas City declared the nation's courtesy
capital.
   ``We're not asking anybody to become Mother Teresa, we're just
asking people to be nice,'' said Fred Davis, the president of the
non-profit Courtesy International Inc.
   In December, Davis quit as minister of Westside Baptist Church
in Harrisonville, 20 miles south of Kansas City, and set out to
fight uncourteous behavior full time.
   William Quitmeier, an attorney who donated office space for
Courtesy International, said that at first he thought the idea was
corny. Now he's the corporation's vice president.
   ``I think Kansas City needs something to hang its hat on,'' he
said. ``We don't have mountains, we don't have lakes.''
   The company is privately funded, but the City Council will
nominate people to fill eight positions still open on Courtesy
International's 12-member executive committee. City Councilman
Chuck Weber said the council might pass a resolution calling for a
``courtesy day.''
   In September, etiquette expert Marjabelle Young Stewart ranked
Kansas City ninth in her annual list of the nation's 10
best-mannered cities.
   Davis is shooting for No. 1.
   His group has printed bumper stickers showing the group's logo _
a person holding a door open for someone else. Next, Courtesy
International plans billboards and radio and television spots using
humor to promote courtesy.

<HEAD>Seven Killed In Palestinian Faction Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas loyal to PLO chief Yasser
Arafat fought Syrian-backed mutineers with mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades in two refugee camps, killing seven
people and wounding 16, police said today.
   The overnight battle brought the toll to 26 killed and 117
wounded since fighting for control of Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh broke out last week.
   The fighting pitted guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's mainstream Fatah faction and adversaries of the
Fatah-Uprising, a group that rebelled against Arafat's leadership
in May 1983.
   The clashes raged all night and faded into sporadic exchanges of
sniper fire this morning, police said.
   A security committee comprising guerrilla officers from seven
other PLO factions not been involved in the fighting was trying to
arrange for observers to enforce a truce in the two shantytowns.
   A police spokesman said two Libyan observers would be stationed
at each of the two camps along with fighters from the seven neutral
factions.
   The disengagement force also will supervise the implementation
of a cease-fire reached in Damascus, Syria, on Monday.
   The Fatah rebels are led by Col. Saeed Mousa. They have been
based in Damascus since the mutiny began.
   Arafat's loyalists dislodged Mousa's fighters from the two camps
in previous rounds of fighting. But Mousa's guerrillas regrouped
and this week mounted new assaults seeking to regain their old
positions.
   Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon. They are stationed in
east and north Lebanon, Moslem west Beirut and Beirut suburbs next
to the camps.
   A Palestinian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Libyan observers will be drawn from a 300-strong contingent
based in east Lebanon since 1982, when it came to Lebanon to help
fight the Israeli invasion.
   The independent Beirut daily newspaper An-Nahar reported Tuesday
that Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has ordered the withdrawal
of his contingent from Lebanon.

   Bands of English, Dutch and
West German rowdies brawled after a European Soccer Championship
match, but the city was quiet today after thousands of riot police
massed in its center.
   Authorities said massive security efforts had thwarted serious
violent clashes. In all, 371 people were arrested during two days
that ended Wednesday. Of them, 18 were English fans, police said.
   Most of those arrested were released after spending several
hours in jail.
   Sporadic fistfights erupted in various parts of the city on
Wednesday after the Netherlands' 3-1 victory over England's
national team. Soccer fans mobbed the streets and Duesseldorf's
main train station.
   But by midnight, the station and surrounding streets were nearly
clear of fans. Most had boarded outbound trains. Streets in the
city's Old Section were also quiet, police said.
   More than 2,300 police were deployed in Duesseldorf to prevent a
recurrence of the rampant vandalism and running battles that
erupted among rowdies in the city Tuesday night.
   ``It wasn't as bad as we had feared,'' said police spokesman
Wolfgang Rodax, adding that most of the violence was initiated by
West German fans.
   ``The English were not the problem,'' Rodax said.
   West German television late Wednesday showed a pistol
confiscated from one of the rowdies, but did not identify its owner.
   On Wednesday night, West German, Dutch and English soccer fans
got into a street brawl near the train station. Riot police rushed
to the scene, broke up the fight and arrested about 20 people,
observers said.
   West German and English rowdies also had minor scuffles inside
the train station itself as English fans waited for trains to take
them out of the city.
   Many of the English were headed to Frankfurt, where England and
the Soviet Union are to meet for a match on Saturday.
   About 22,000 Dutch and about 8,500 English fans jammed into
Duesseldorf for the game on Wednesday.
   Their arrival followed a night of vandalism and fighting pitting
West German fans against English soccer buffs. Police said in that
round of violence 130 people were arrested, 90 of them English and
40 West Germans.
   English club teams were barred from European Cup tournaments
after a rampage by English fans that left 39 people dead at a
European Cup final in Brussels, Belgium three years ago.
   Bert Millichip, chairman of the British Football Association,
said the latest trouble could destroy the last faint hope English
clubs have of being readmitted to European competition, and that he
feared it might also force the international team into exile.
   British Sports Minister Colin Moynihan, who was on a
fact-finding mission in Duesseldorf for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher to look into the clashes, also strongly denounced the
violence.
   Moynihan, also speaking to the Press Association, said of the
British troublemakers: ``They are worse than animals, because I
know of no animals which would behave in this manner.''

   The man with the shabby clothes and the faraway
look ambled down West 46th Street. Behind him strode six Guardian
Angels, making sure he kept on ambling, through Restaurant Row and
out of the neighborhood off Broadway.
   ``He's not going to sell (drugs) with us around,'' Travis
``Ace'' Stephens, head of the Angels' operation, said Wednesday
night as he watched the parade.
   The Angels were recruited last week by a group of 15
restaurateurs who claimed increased drug dealing on the street had
cut their business by as much as 20 percent.
   The resulting publicity, however, also may be hurting business,
said Frank Medlin, manager of Carolina, one of the participating
restaurants, though he thinks the Angels ``are doing a wonderful
job.''
   ``We have alerted everyone that West 46th Street is combat
alley,'' he said. ``We may have a safer block _ with no one on it.''
   Despite debates over whether the patrols are good or bad,
whether the Angels are violating people's rights _ and despite
attacks on two Angels on Saturday that resulted in the
hospitalization of a 16-year-old Angel _ the Angels will continue
``slammin' and jammin','' leader Curtis Sliwa said.
   That means holding suspected drug dealers up against a wall,
under citizen's arrest, until police arrive. Those carrying just a
little crack may get off with crushed vials and a shove.
   ``It's not a block watch or a crime watch, it's physical
intervention,'' Sliwa said. ``It's action.''
   The Angels on Wednesday expanded their patrols into the Broadway
theater district and neighboring Hell's Kitchen, a neighborhood
plagued by a drug problem, he said.
   The Angels began their watch June 7 in return for a headquarters
in the closed Cafe de France and meals from restaurants on the
block between Eighth and Ninth avenues.
   Sliwa recalled that he laughed when first approached about
patrolling Restaurant Row, a pleasant block of brownstones lined
with more than 20 restaurants near the theater district. Still, he
agreed to stop by.
   ``We're walking down the street,'' Sliwa said, ``and dudes were
cracking it up all over the place.''
   To get there from the theaters and hotels around Times Square,
patrons must cross Eighth Avenue, a noisy, tawdry thoroughfare
lined with porno palaces.
   Bringing in the Angels while complaining about a lack of police
protection naturally led to tension between the civilian patrol and
the Police Department.
   Two Angels were arrested Sunday and charged with menacing and
harassing a man on the sidewalk. ``Even the police have no right to
tell someone to get off the block,'' said Assistant Chief Thomas
Walsh.
   Police officials told Sliwa on Sunday night that the Angels must
refrain from harassing people they suspect of drug dealing. They
could make a citizen's arrest only if they witnessed a crime.
   Wednesday afternoon, Angels grabbed a man they said had been
selling crack, called police and held him until officers arrived
and arrested him on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled
substance. It was the first such arrest since Sunday.
   ``They do good, but they can be a hazard,'' said Joseph Dirdis,
45, as he sat on the steps outside his 46th Street apartment
building. ``They move as a group, and they react very fast _ they
have to take it easy. They make me a little uncomfortable.''
   But Wednesday night, many passers-by greeted the Angels with
encouragement: ``Keep up the good work'' and ``We're proud of you
guys.''
   ``These guys aren't hurting people who are minding their own
business,'' said Ralph Bilby, who lives on West 47th Street and
stopped by the Angels' headquarters to offer support. ``It doesn't
feel dangerous anymore.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, asked about the expanding patrols, said,
``There's nothing wrong with that. We can encourage responsible
citizen involvement.''
   The Angels use ``methods used by the cop on the beat years
ago,'' Sliwa said, before complaints by civil libertarians limited
their options.
   ``We say, just because you've put manacles on your own cops,
don't take away our rights as citizens to make arrests,'' he said.
``Because of the cops' inability to intervene, we have picked up
the slack.''
   Sliwa added, ``We haven't changed our tactics _ it's just that
we're in the eye of the storm now.''

   Long Island Lighting Co.'s board of
directors unanimously approved an agreement with the state under
which the completed but unused Shoreham nuclear power plant would
be torn down.
   It would be the first time in the nation that a completed
nuclear plant was abandoned.
   Under the proposal approved Wednesday, the utility would
continue as a privately owned company and be provided with annual
rate hikes of about 5 percent over 10 years.
   The agreement is subject to the approval of various state
agencies and the Legislature. It calls for the utility to sell the
$5.3 billion plant to the state for $1. The plant would then be
torn down.
   The plant, 50 miles from Manhattan on Long Island, was completed
in 1984. The utility failed to obtain an operating license because
the state and local governments refused to participate in emergency
planning, arguing it was impossible to evacuate the surrounding
area in an accident.

<HEAD>Dry Weather Continues Over Drought-Plagued U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms dampened sections of the
drought-plagued Midwest today, but dry weather prevailed elsewhere
after severe storms spawned damaging tornadoes in Colorado.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from east-central New Mexico
to southern Kansas, northern Oklahoma, southern Illinois and
southwestern Indiana.
   Skies were clear over the East, the Gulf Coast, the
north-central United States and the Southwest. Rainfall totals for
the six-hour period ending at 2 a.m. EDT were generally less than a
quarter of an inch.
   A major dry spell has been damaging crops and tightening water
supplies in the Midwest and Southeast.
   On Wednesday, thunderstorms brought much-needed rain to the
central High Plains, but also generated twisters and large hail.
   Five tornadoes were sighted in Colorado, four of them in the
Denver area. The twisters tossed vehicles and storage sheds through
the air, tore off several roofs and injured seven people, none
seriously.
   Hail up to baseball size was reported in Messex, Colo.; Albin
and Glenrock, Wyo.; and Merino, Colo., where windows and trees were
damaged.
   In southeastern Colorado, thunderstorms produced heavy rain,
washing out a county road bridge east of Caddoa. Showers and
thunderstorms also fell in sections of Kansas, Missouri and
Illinois.
   In Chicago, just a trace of precipitation has been measured for
the first half of June, the longest dry spell in 118 years of
record-keeping.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 109 degrees in Phoenix, Bullhead
City and Coolidge, Ariz.; and Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Great Plains, Arkansas and southern Missouri
to the mid- and northern Atlantic Coast; isolated showers and
thunderstorms in the Rocky Mountains; and sunny, dry weather in the
rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were expected to climb into the 60s and 70s over
the Great Lakes area, western Washington state and along much of
the California Coast; the 90s from Montana to western New Mexico;
the 90s to near 115 degrees in the desert Southwest; and the 80s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 92 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Striking Scriptwriters File Unfair Labor Practice Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Striking scriptwriters have filed unfair
labor practice charges against 13 production companies but have
scheduled another meeting with producers in an effort to end their
4-month-old walkout.
   The charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board
on Wednesday, said Writers Guild of America spokeswoman Cheryl
Rhoden.
   They accuse the companies of bargaining in bad faith by refusing
to provide information on writers as requested by the guild last
month, Ms. Rhoden said.
   The union had requested the names, addresses, dates of
employment and rates of pay for persons providing guild-covered
writing services since March 7, Ms. Rhoden said in a statement.
   The companies include Walt Disney Pictures and Television for
its ``I Man'' production; Capital Cities@ABC Inc. for ``General
Hospital,'' Fox Square Productions, for ``The Late Show,'' and
Paramount Pictures for the shows, ``McGyver,'' ``Star Trek, the
Next Generation,'' ``Webster'' and ``The Naked Gun.''
   The statement was issued late Wednesday, and the companies could
not be reached for immediate comment.
   Representatives of the guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers, meanwhile, were scheduled to meet again
this afternoon in a bargaining session that management said could
``conclude negotiations.''
   Although the guild agreed to the meeting, Ms. Rhoden said ``the
producers are trying to stampede us into a settlement.''
   Sources have said only one issue _ foreign residual payments _
remains.
   Top negotiators for the guild and the producers' alliance have
been meeting informally since the parties' last formal session
ended Saturday.
   On Wednesday, the producers called ``for a meeting of the
bargaining committees to conclude negotiations.''
   ``Spelled out, that means we are going to give them a formal
proposal, based on the intensive meetings we had last week,'' said
Herb Steinberg, an alliance spokesman.
   The latest effort to end the strike comes on the eve of the
television production season. Also looming is this week's scheduled
start of talks between producers and the International Association
of Theatrical Stage Employees and Teamsters unions. The stage craft
workers' and drivers' contracts expire July 31.
   A guild source who spoke on condition of anonymity said ``major
issues remain unresolved, and we don't anticipate (today's)
discussions to result in an imminent end to the strike.''
   Sources have said the guild has accepted a producer's formula
based on sales success for syndicated one-hour television shows.
The previous formula had a fixed revenue. Producers have claimed
the market for such sales has softened.
   But because the guild has accepted a management proposal in
one-hour shows, sources said, union negotiators want a substantial
increase for foreign residuals, an area that has been booming for
several years for studios and distributors but has not been
negotiated for 18 years.
   The guild has cited reports from Forbes magazine that estimated
a $4.9 billion trade surplus for the nationwide entertainment
industry in 1986, with an estimated surplus of $5.5 billion for
1987, second only to the aerospace industry.

<HEAD>Students Demanding Punishment For Chun Riot And Try To Firebomb

   Radicals demanding punishment for
former President Chun Doo-hwan fought riot police with firebombs
and rocks today. Police said they arrested six students trying to
firebomb Chun's home.
   Police said about 20 students hurling firebombs dashed toward
Chun's home in western Seoul on Wednesday night. Police guards
using tear gas guns stopped the students about 150 yards away from
Chun's home and arrested six.
   The students hurled six firebombs at police and a nearby police
post, shouting ``Investigate corruption under the former
government'' and other anti-government slogans, police said. No
damage or injuries were reported.
   Police seized 48 firebombs and leaflets accusing Chun of abuses
of power and corruption during his seven-year tenure. The students
demanded a full probe and punishment of the former president and
his wife.
   Fierce fighting broke out today at the University of Foreign
Study in eastern Seoul when about 1,000 radicals from five nearby
schools tried to march off campus. Police stopped them with volleys
of tear gas.
   ``Punish criminals'' and ``Yankee go home,'' the students
shouted as they hurled firebombs and rocks. At least three students
suffered minor injuries.
   The radical students demanded the punishment of Chun, President
Roh Tae-woo and the United States. It accused them of masterminding
the South Korean army's bloody suppression of a 1980 civil uprising
in the southern city of Kwangju. Nearly 200 people were killed in
the nine-day uprising for democracy.
   Students also shouted slogans supporting North Korea's demand to
co-host the Summer Olympics, opening Sept. 17 in Seoul, and
demanded the withdrawal of some 42,000 U.S. troops stationed here
under a mutual defense pact. They contend the United States
enforces partition of the Korean peninsula to rule the South as a
colony.
   Minor clashes were reported in the southern city of Taejon today
when students fought police at a campus. The students were
denouncing the blocking of a student march to the North Korea
border.
   Major street clashes broke out last Friday when riot police
blocked thousands of radical students from marching to the North
Korean border for talks with North Korean students on reunifying
the peninsula, divided since the end of World War II.
   Chun and his family have been accused of corruption since he
stepped down in February. His younger brother, Chun Kyong-hwan, is
awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement, influence peddling and
extortion.
   South Korea's opposition political parties have urged the
government to punish Chun's family for alleged corruption,
contending Chun's family members had sent huge amounts of embezzled
funds abroad.
   The main opposition Party for Peace and Democracy says more than
100 of Chun's relatives embezzled national property when they
occupied key posts in government agencies and state-run firms.
   It also accuses Chun of being responsible for numerous cases of
torture and brutality against dissidents when he took power with
military backing in 1980.
   President Roh Tae-woo's Democratic Justice Party has opposed a
direct investigation of the former president, who has been one of
Roh's close friends since their graduation from the Military
Academy in 1955.
   Chun agreed to direct presidential elections and other
democratic reforms after massive protests last summer. Roh was
elected when the opposition could not agree on a single candidate.

<HEAD>China Objects to Dalai Lama News Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese official today criticized the European
Parliament for allowing Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama,
to hold a news conference at the parliament building in Strasbourg,
France.
   The parliament had invited the Dalai Lama to make a formal
address, but withdrew the invitation after China showed displeasure
by canceling its invitation to the parliament to send a delegation
to China.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing refused to comment on the
Dalai Lama's offer at his news conference Wednesday to accept
Chinese troops in Tibet and Chinese control over the region's
external affairs in exchange for greater autonomy in internal
matters.
   Li told a weekly news briefing that he could not answer
questions about Tibet because Tibet is not a foreign country.
   An official who answered the telephone at the Nationality
Affairs Commission, which has responsibility for Tibet and other
minority areas, said he could not immediately comment.
   Li said, ``We are opposed to the provision of a forum to the
Dalai Lama for his activities aimed at undermining the unification
of the motherland by any foreign organizations or individuals.''
   The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that complete independence for
Tibet ``is very difficult to achieve.''
   He suggested a ``middle way,'' in which China would make Tibet a
self-governing, democratic political entity while continuing to run
Tibet's foreign affairs.
   He also agreed to a ``restricted number of (Chinese) military
installations'' in the remote Himalayan region.
   The proposal was the most conciliatory yet by the Dalai Lama
since he fled Tibet in 1959 during a failed uprising by his
followers against Chinese rule.
   The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists.
Before the Chinese Red Army entered the remote Himalayan region in
1950, he also was head of its theocratic civil government.
   China claims to have had sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th
century, but periods of actual control have been sporadic.
   The Dalai Lama has lived since 1959 in India and has repeatedly
accused the Chinese government of systematically violating human
rights in Tibet and oppressing the people by stationing hundreds of
thousands of soldiers there.
   Pro-independence sentiment remains strong among many Tibetans,
especially young Buddhist monks. Monks led anti-Chinese protests in
October and March in which thousands of Tibetatns stoned police and
attacked official buildings and cars.
   At least 38 people were killed in the two protests, and hundreds
were arrested.

<HEAD>Mercenary Witness Should Be Jailed, Magistrate Says</HEAD>

   A federal magistrate says a former mercenary should
be jailed for refusing to cooperate in a $24 million lawsuit
against an alleged guns-for-drugs smuggling conspiracy to aid the
Contras.
   Sam Hall refused to answer questions or turn over documents
Wednesday in the civil case filed against U.S. government
officials, Contra leaders and Medellin Cartel drug traffickers by
two journalists and the liberal Christic Institute.
   ``It has to do with principle,'' Hall told U.S. Magistrate
William Turnoff. ``My past would have been in vain.''
   But the magistrate said Hall's position had no legal basis and
ordered him held in civil contempt until he answered the questions
during depositions. Turnoff said he would make his recommendation
to the presiding judge in the case, Chief U.S. District Judge James
L. King, who is on vacation until next week.
   The suit was filed by Martha Honey and her husband, Tony
Avirgan. Avirgan was injured in a 1984 bombing in Nicaragua that he
blames on the alleged conspirators.
   The damage and racketeering suit charges that members of a
right-wing terror network tracing back to 1959 illegally
participated in assassination plots, gun running and drug
trafficking.
   Hall, who will remain free at least until King returns to the
bench, said he has been told he can be jailed indefinitely for
refusing to hand over the documents, and for up to six months for
not answering questions.
   ``I'm prepared to go to jail as long as the case takes,'' he
said.
   Hall is not considered a major witness in the case, but the
plaintiffs want to know who paid and directed Hall while he aided
the Contras inside Nicaragua. In 1986, Hall was caught by the
Sandinista government, which called him mentally unstable and later
kicked him out of the country.
   Hall has acknowledged receiving funds from anticommunist
militant and former Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, his boss in
Nicaragua and one of 29 defendants in the suit. The case is set for
trial June 27.
   However, he repeatedly refused to disclose where other funds
came from or who trained and directed him in the use of explosives.
   Asked whom he was protecting, Hall replied ``Singlaub and
above,'' indicating U.S. government officials. But he added his
information, while politically embarrassing, did not involve
illegal acts.
   Hall, who lives in Redington Shores, also said he has
connections with Iran-Contra figure Robert Owen, an assistant to
Oliver North and a defendant in the suit. He said Owen promised him
a presidential pardon for his activities in Nicaragua.
   Singlaub's attorney, Thomas Spencer, also attended the hearing,
and bitterly attacked the Washington-based Christic Institute and
the suit.
   ``This is a completely baseless lawsuit ... that has consumed
hundreds of thousands of dollars, indeed millions of dollars of the
defendants' money,'' he told Turnoff.
   Along with Singlaub and Owen, defendants in the suit include
Theodore Shackley, former deputy director of operations for the
CIA; Contra director Adolfo Calero; Medellin Cartel leaders Pablo
Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa Vasquez; Iran-Contra figures
Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, and others.
   The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the
Iran-Contra affair became public.

<HEAD>Soviet Jews Express Concern Over Lack Of Immigration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 700 Jews who emigrated from the Soviet
Union gathered for an emotional reunion that was tinged by a
concern that many of their compatriots are choosing not to come to
Israel.
   The reunion in Tel Aviv marked the 18th anniversary of an
unsuccessful attempt by a Lenigrad Zionist group to hijack a Soviet
plane to Israel. The attempt was foiled by authorities before the
passengers even boarded the plane.
   In Jerusalem, Soviet film director Eldar Ryazanov, visiting
Israel on a trip that would have been unfathomable several years
ago, told about 1,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants that ``freedom to
travel, to move, is as natural as the freedom to breathe.''
   Ryazanov, who is in Israel screening his latest film for Soviet
Jewish immigrants, praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ``the most
humane leader'' his country has had in decades.
   He also said ties between Israel and the Soviet Union, severed
by the Kremlin in 1967, should be renewed. His remarks won applause
from the Jerusalem Theater audience.
   At the Tel Aviv meeting Wednesday night, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said that fervor to emigrate among Soviet Jews in the 1970s
left him feeling something close to nostalgia.
   ``No one asked where these people wanted to fly to ... everyone
knew they wanted to come to Israel,'' Shamir said.
   More than 90 percent of the Jews who left the Soviet Union last
month did not come to Israel.
   Hillel Butman, 55, who was jailed for nine years for his role in
the hijacking, put much of the blame for the high dropout rate on
the immigrants themselves.
   ``There is still a lot of Soviet propoganda and lies about
Israel, but the worst is letters from relatives here who write only
about the bad, not the good,'' Butman said.
   The immigrants' prime complaint about Israel can be explained in
one word: jobs. Many of the Russian Jews are highly-educated
professionals with specialized training, who have difficulty
finding appropriate openings here.
   ``It's just impossible to find work,'' said Moshe Liberman, an
engineer with a doctorate who immigrated seven months ago after
waiting 12 years for an exit visa. ``I could find a job in the
United States, or Canada _ certainly in South Africa. But we wanted
to be here.''
   His wife, Chana, a piano teacher who was fired for her Zionist
activities in 1981, added, ``When we were refuseniks, I used to
tell everyone they must come to Israel, that this is our state and
they must be here. But now I don't know what I would say.''
   Recent political developments, especially the six-month
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, have
discouraged Soviet Jews from coming to Israel, said Ze'ev Green,
who settled in the northern port town of Haifa in 1979.
   ``Soviet propoganda is very effective, and it is very easy these
days to take an article from an Israeli newspaper, condense it and
make it say that even the Israelis admit they kill all Arabs and
have apartheid,'' Green said.

   An Army probe that allegedly forced a Wedtech
Corp. rival out of business included accusations echoing those
contained in memos sent to Attorney General Edwin Meese III by a
friend and Wedtech consultant, it was reported today.
   Allegations in memos sent to Meese by Wedtech consultant Robert
Wallach bear a striking similarity to language contained in a
highly critical Army report on the company later issued by the
Army, the Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions.
   However, no link between Meese and the investigation of
Houston-based Garcia Ordnance Corp. has been documented, the
newspaper said.
   Wallach was indicted on charges that he accepted hundreds of
thousands of dollars from Wedtech in an improper attempt to
influence Meese on behalf of the defunct New York defense
contractor. Wallach is scheduled to be tried with two associates
later this year.
   Garcia Ordnance is not mentioned in Wallach's indictment.
   Wedtech received a no-bid, $32-million Army engine contract in
1982 with strong backing from then-Meese aide James E. Jenkins,
according to testimony in federal court earlier this year and at
Senate hearings last fall.
   Although many of the allegations made against Garcia were never
proven, the newspaper reported, its executives were barred from
doing business with the government.
   Because the government was the company's only customer, Garcia
Ordnance was forced out of business when it was barred from
government work, company officers said.
   Attorneys for Meese, a presidential counselor during the time he
received the memos, and Wallach denied any involvement in
triggering the Garcia probe.
   The office of independent counsel James C. McKay, who is
investigating Meese, is aware of the Garcia case but refused to
comment on it, according to the Times.
   Army officials refused to disclose what sparked the probe by its
Criminal Investigation Division that came despite earlier favorable
reports about the company from military procurement officers.
   A dozen Garcia officers were indicted for alleged fraud after
the probe, but 11 were acquitted last year by a presiding judge who
said the case never should have been brought to criminal court.
   Garcia Ordnance President Ronald J.Bolden was convicted of
submitting five false documents to the Army but was cleared of
charges he conspired to defraud the government by substituting iron
for steel in an engine crankshaft.
   Acquitted Garcia executive Bill Parker said Army procurement
officers turned hostile in one month between 1983 and 1984.
   ``The model contractor in December was a bum in January,''
Parker said. ``Why? Because we were jumping up as a competitor to
Wedtech.''
   Garcia became a serious Wedtech competitor in December 1983,
when it was certified as a minority-operated firm eligible for
special government contracts. Wedtech also had the certification.
   Bolden blamed Wedtech and Meese for inspiring the case against
Garcia, saying Army officials told him Meese was aligned with
Wedtech and wanted an end to Garcia's competition.
   The 1981-82 memos from Wallach to Meese that were obtained by
the newspaper reportedly denounced Garcia as an inexperienced
company with insufficient resources to handle large government
contracts.
   And in the Army Criminal Investigation Division report dated
June 1, 1983, the same arguments were made, the newspaper said.
   However, Garcia was highly praised by Army engine specialists at
Ft. Belvoir, Va., in a 1982 report that said the firm was competent
and professional despite being in business only two years.

   The state attorney general has begun an
investigation of a possible hoax by advisers surrounding Tawana
Brawley, citing a former family aide who called the teen-ager's
story of racial assault ``a pack of lies.''
   Attorney General Robert Abrams announced Wednesday that he had
subpoenaed Perry McKinnon, a former aide to the Rev. Al Sharpton
who says Sharpton and Ms. Brawley's other advisers are interested
only in advancing their political goals.
   ``The Tawana Brawley story may be that there is no Tawana
Brawley story,'' McKinnon told reporters.
   Miss Brawley, who is black, has said she was kidnapped and raped
by six white men in November. She was found behind her apartment
complex in Wappingers Falls, an upstate New York town, partly in a
plastic bag, her hair shorn, racial epithets scrawled on her body
and animal excrement smeared on her.
   She and her mother have refused to cooperate in an investigation
into her claims, saying they believe the probe won't be fair.
   At a news conference, Abrams said McKinnon's charges, if true,
amounted to ``a damning indictment'' of the motivation and the
credibility of Sharpton and the two Brawley family lawyers, Alton
Maddox and C. Vernon Mason.
   The three advisers, in an appearance Wednesday on the nationally
broadcast television talk show ``Donahue,'' denounced McKinnon and
denied that he had played any role in the Brawley case.
   As the largely black audience booed and hissed loudly at the
mention of McKinnon's name, Maddox labeled him ``a baldfaced liar
and a desperate man.''
   McKinnon, a 39-year-old private investigator who served as an
aide to Sharpton from January until May, told the Daily News and
WCBS-TV that he left the Brawley team because the teen-ager's story
``is all nothing but a pack of lies.''
   ``This whole situation is not about Tawana Brawley. It's about
Mason and Maddox and Sharpton taking over the town, so to speak,''
McKinnon told WCBS. He told the News that Sharpton said, ```If we
can win this Tawana thing, we'll be the biggest niggers in New
York.'''
   The real story, he told WCBS, ``is the political agenda of
Sharpton, Mason and Maddox.''
   McKinnon was described by the state attorney general as ``a
high-level intimate of the Brawley advisers'' who was seen in
``close conversation'' with Brawley family members and Sharpton,
Maddox and Mason at demonstrations in Poughkeepsie.
   The charges ``deserve immediate and careful attention,'' said
Abrams, who was appointed special prosecutor in the case by Gov.
Mario Cuomo. He said McKinnon was subpoenaed Wednesday to testify
before the Dutchess County grand jury looking into the case.
   ``If Mr. McKinnon is right, then attorneys Mason and Maddox and
Rev. Sharpton have been consciously perpetrating a hoax, not only
on the black community but on all the people of the state of New
York,'' Abrams said.
   The News and New York Post reported that McKinnon would testify
today.
   Sharpton, however, dismissed McKinnon as ``a guy that drove me
around. If he says the story is a pack of lies, why don't you ask
him what the story is? He doesn't know.''
   ``I have not confided in him in the least,'' said Maddox,
alluding to McKinnon's claim that the Brawley advisers admitted
privately that they had no evidence of what happened to their
client.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, also appeared on ``Donahue'' and
continued to give her unequivocal support to her advisers.
   The program was broadcast live from the Bethany Baptist Church
in Brooklyn, where Mrs. Brawley has taken ``religious sanctuary''
to avoid arrest for refusing a subpoena directing her to testify
before the grand jury investigating her daughter's case.
   Tawana Brawley's attorneys asked for a new special prosecutor in
the case and accused Abrams of conducting a racially biased
investigation.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Popularity of U.S. And Japan Falling Among South
Koreans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The popularity of the United States among South
Koreans is falling drastically, and an increasing number of South
Koreans have negative feelings toward Japan, an international
survey said today.
   The poll was conducted by South Korea's Dong-A Ilbo daily,
Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper and Louis Harris and Associates,
Inc., of the United States.
   It said only 38 percent of the South Koreans polled said they
like the United States, compared with 70 percent four years ago.
   It said 51 percent of the 1,996 respondents in South Korea said
they dislike Japan, up from 39 percent four years ago.
   The number of South Koreans feeling friendly toward Japan fell
from 23 percent in a previous 1984 poll to 14 percent, the survey
said.
   The poll, carried out last month, was the second of its kind and
also queried Americans and Japanese on their perception of South
Korea.
   American opinion on ties with South Korea was split, with 43
percent of the 1,258 respondents saying they believe relations are
going well, while 40 percent answered in the negative.
   Seoul has come under fire from the United States to increase
access to its market to reduce a $10 billion trade imbalance it
registered last year.
   When asked what they most closely associated with their Asian
neighbor, a majority of the 2,292 Japanese respondents cited the
upcoming Olympic Games.
   But 30 percent of the South Koreans said they associate Japan
with its colonization of the Korean peninusula from 1910 to 1945.
   About 48 percent of the South Koreans also said relations with
Tokyo were negative, up 11 percentage points, and only 24 percent
said relations with Japan were positive.

<HEAD>Two Teamsters To Be Tried For Murder In Dupont Plaza Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Teamsters will go on trial Aug.
8 in connection with the deaths of 97 people in the December 1986
Dupont Plaza Hotel fire, a judge ruled.
   District Court Judge Hector Brull Cestero on Wednesday also
found probable cause to try former union local vice president
Manuel de Jesus Santiago Rios for perjury in a ruling made after a
two-week preliminary hearing.
   The three members of Teamsters Local 901 were arrested in
February in connection with the fire. Three other union members
already have confessed to setting the blaze and are serving long
prison sentences.
   According to the ruling, former union delegate Luis Muniz
Marquez and former hotel maintenance worker Luis Elias Vega Rios
will be tried for murder, arson and causing damage. Muniz Marquez
will also be tried for perjury.
   The star prosecution witness was Hector Escudero Aponte, a
former hotel maintenance worker who confessed to setting the fire
with a can of cooking fuel the afternoon of New Year's Eve.
   Escudero testified that union officials encouraged him to to
start fires as a means of pressuring hotel management to agree to
union contract demands.
   Prosecutors presented about a dozen witnesses at the hearing.
   The fire broke out when the beachfront hotel was packed with
about 1,000 tourists and visitors.
   Of the 97 people killed, 86 died in the casino. In addition, 140
people were injured.

<HEAD>Blood Vials Tainted With AIDS Antibody Found on Beach</HEAD>

   Two vials of blood found on the New Jersey
shore earlier this month contained the AIDS antibody, the Health
Department said, but it stressed that the samples posed virtually
no risk to swimmers.
   ``There hasn't been any evidence of AIDS contamination with such
samples,'' Thomas Burke, acting health commissioner, said Wednesday.
   The samples, which have been turned over to the attorney
general's office for further investigation, were discovered June 3
or 4, Burke said at a news conference.
   One vial was found on Ortley Beach and the other on the north
side of Island Beach State Park, both in Ocean County. Burke said
officials didn't know how long they had been there.
   Beach patrols discovered five glass tubes, each about 5 inches
long and less than an inch in diameter, containing coagulated
blood, said Burke. Only two were found to have evidence of the AIDS
antibody, he said.
   Presence of the AIDS antibody means the blood came from
individuals who carry the AIDS virus and will probably develop the
fatal disease, said Burke.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's ability
to defend itself against disease.
   ``We do not have a threat of AIDS or AIDS contamination from
these samples,'' said Burke.
   The vials were found at about the same time as some syringes.
Health officials could not determine where the items came from,
except that they probably originated from a clinic or hospital.
   Burke is temporarily replacing Commissioner Dr. Molly J. Coye,
who is in Stockholm, Sweden, for an international AIDS conference.

<HEAD>Dog Dies As Owner Forced Out Of Public Housing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodboy, an elderly Afghan hound, collapsed and
died in 90-plus degree heat as his 91-year-old owner was forced out
of her public housing home because of rules against pets.
   After a quarter-century in an apartment at Columbia Point, Alice
Stacy, her pet and her belongings were being moved to a new Boston
Housing Authority project in the Mattapan section in the humid heat
Wednesday.
   ``Goodboy never made it inside the house,'' she said. ``I was
sitting inside and I asked where Goodboy was. I went outside, and
he was laid out and he was breathing awfully hard.''
   The long-haired dog was moved to shade and given water, but he
failed to respond. Goodboy was taken to an animal clinic but could
not be revived.
   The dog probably died of a combination of age, heat and the
stress of moving, said Martha C. Armstrong of the Massachusetts
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   Stacy said the dog had been restless the night before the move.
``He was up and down and I didn't sleep, either,'' she added.
   Stacy, who had said she would never give up Goodboy, lost a
six-month fight after the housing authority and CMJ Management Co.
said she had to give away her pet or leave the project. CMJ is
renovating the housing buildings.
   Ironically, Goodboy's death will allow Stacy to return to a unit
at Columbia Point, where she has friends.
   ``I'm going back,'' she said. ``The problem child is returning.''
   Commissioner Diane Payne of the Department of Elderly Affairs
said Stacy would be moved back today to one of the renovated units.
Payne had accompanied the woman and her dog on the one-day move.
   Goodboy's memory may live on. Armstrong has been lobbying the
Massachusetts Legislature for a law to allow pets for residents of
state-financed public housing for seniors. She said she plans to
attach Goodboy's name to the bill.

<HEAD>Bus Depot in Brooklyn to be Named After Jackie Gleason</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Kramden would have been proud.
   The late Jackie Gleason, who played Kramden on ``The
Honeymooners'' and made him probably the best-known bus driver in
history, will be honored with his very own bus depot in Brooklyn.
   The Fifth Avenue depot on 36th Street is to be renamed the
``Jackie Gleason Depot'' on June 30.
   Gleason's widow, Marilyn, plans to attend the ceremony,
according to the Daily News. June Taylor, head of the June Taylor
Dancers who opened the old ``Jackie Gleason Show,'' will accompany
Mrs. Gleason, who is her sister.
   Members of ``The Honeymooners'' cast _ Audrey Meadows, Art
Carney and Joyce Randolph _ have all been invited to attend.
   A new logo is being designed for the depot and will be worn as a
uniform arm patch. The logo will be chosen from among three
finalists submitted by drivers and other employees. The three
resemble the scene shown at the beginning of each episode of ``The
Honeymooners.''
   Sonny Hall, president of the Transport Workers Union Local 100,
says renaming the depot is a great idea.
   ``I think Jackie did a lot for the image of the driver,'' he
said.
   Gleason, an honorary member of the TWU, died last year at the
age of 71.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Press Offensive Against Tamil Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian peacekeeping troops cordoned
off a Tamil town in eastern Sri Lanka today and began rounding up
suspected rebels, area residents and diplomatic sources said.
   In India, meanwhile, a newspaper reported that the main Tamil
rebel group in Sri Lanka has agreed in principle to surrender most
of its arms in exchange for the rehabilitation of its fighters.
   Residents of Batticola, 135 miles east of Colombo, said by
telephone that Indian troops had surrounded the adjacent town of
Kallady at about dawn today and had rounded up hundreds of Tamils
for questioning.
   A spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in
Colombo said only that ``Indian troops are continuing their search
for Tamil Tiger arms and fighters.'' She spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The state-run Daily News today quoted Indian sources as saying
Indian troops captured 21 Tamil rebels Wednesday, including four
guerrilla leaders.
   It said the rebels were arrested during ``white flag protests''
in the northern and eastern provinces, where Tamils predominate.
   Hundreds of Tamil homes were decked with white flags Wednesday
to underscore a demand that India begin negotiations with the
rebels.
   In July, President Junius Jayewardene of Sri Lanka signed an
Indian-sponsored peace accord aimed at ending the Tamils' guerrilla
war.
   But the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest of the
rebel groups, rejected the pact and continued fighting for a
separate homeland.
   The English-language Indian Express today quoted unidentified
Tamil leaders in the southern Indian city of Madras as saying an
agreement was in the works between the Tigers and the Indian
government.
   The Express said the two sides still were negotiating the period
of time over which the rebels would surrender their arms and their
role in restoring peace after five years of guerrilla warfare.
   The story did not specify exactly what is meant by
rehabilitation but the word is generally used to mean helping the
combatants shift from soldiering to more socially useful
occupations.
   The paper said the agreement could be announced as early as
Friday, when Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visits Madras.
   An Indian official in New Delhi, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that the report was
speculative, but that Indian officials had been talking with the
Tamil rebels.
   India became involved in the Sri Lankan war because it is the
dominant power in the region and because of the sympathies of its
own 60 million Tamils to the separatist rebels' cause.
   India has sent at least 50,000 troops to Sri Lanka to police the
cease-fire called for in the July agreement, and this force has
inflicted a series of defeats on the rebels in recent weeks.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. They claim discrimination by the
Sinhalese Buddhists, who form 75 percent of the population and
control the government and military.

<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army vowed
today to wage ``unceasing war'' against Britain after a guerrilla
bomb blew up at a festive foot race packed with people, killing six
soldiers and wounding 10 civilians.
   The IRA's Belfast Brigade claimed responsibility for Wednesday
night's bombing _ the guerrilla group's deadliest attack in seven
months _ in a statement today to news media in Belfast.
   IRA guerrillas slipped into the predominantly Protestant town of
Lisburn, headquarters of the British Army in Northern Ireland, and
wired a bomb containing seven pounds of explosives to an unmarked
army van, the statement said.
   The blue van exploded as six soldiers rode away in it after
taking part in half-marathon of 13 miles that had attracted 4,250
competitors to Lisburn, seven miles southwest of Belfast.
   All six soldiers were killed, bringing this year's death toll
from the province's sectarian violence to 38, eight this week alone.
   Mayor Billy Bleakes said the town was in ``shock and disbelief
that any human being could do this to other human beings.''
   None of the civilians, including an 80-year-old man and a
2-year-old boy, suffered serious injuries, police said.
   Valerie Fleming, 28, who lives nearby, said the town ``was
packed with people ... They were running about screaming. There
were children and families. They were terrified.''
   The death toll was the highest since an IRA bombing at a war
memorial ceremony in Enniskillen on Nov. 8. The IRA said that bomb
was meant to kill soldiers but accidentally massacred 11 Protestant
civilians.
   The explosion occurred as the van moved through the town center,
which was thronged with runners and spectators leaving the charity
run.
   Nigel Sands, 19, who was two cars behind the van, said he saw
smoke, then heard a loud explosion ``and I saw two bodies lying in
the middle of the road. One of them had no legs, and one of them
was burning. It as badly mutilated. It seems they were blown from
the van. There was panic and people were running everywhere.''
   Although police said they received no warning before the blast,
the IRA said: ``Every care was exercised by our volunteers to
ensure the minimum risk to the local population.
   The statement said the British presence in Northern Ireland
oppressed the Irish people, adding:
   ``Until that presence is removed and the Irish people as a unit
can exercise our right to national self-determination, the Irish
Republican Army will continue to wage unceasing war against the
British Crown Forces and the British colonial presence.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's representative in the
province, Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, toured the bomb
scene today and told reporters later the attack revealed the
``vileness of terrorism which we have to face.''
   King said, however, that the security forces had not taken
adequate security precautions to prevent the bombing.
   British soldiers and police are the main targets of the IRA in
its nearly 20-year war to oust the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.
   Police on today cordoned the area where the bomb went off.
Townspeople gathered in clusters by ribbon barrier, gazing in
silence at the van's gutted hulk.
   Belfast's Irish News, the province's main Catholic newspaper,
said the IRA had opened ``another blood-stained chapter in their
perverted history ... The result of their savagery will only be to
harden hearts and block progress towards an eventual solution.''
   It was the army's worst blow since a 1982 bombing in a pub near
Londonderry killed 11 soldiers and six civilians. An IRA offshoot,
the Irish National Liberation Army, claimed responsibility for that
attack.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hint that a missing couple from Wheaton College
are still alive has come from an unlikely source _ a vacation book
on Hawaii checked out of a suburban Chicago library and found in
Minnesota.
   The book was returned to the Wheaton Public Library from a St.
Paul, Minn., post office where it was found. It had been checked
out with Scott Swanson's library card, police said Wednesday.
   Swanson, 23, and Carolyn MacLean, 21, have not been seen since
April 2. Their luxury car was found in a downtown Chicago alley
with most of their belongings undisturbed and the keys still in the
ignition.
   Police initially suspected the couple had met with foul play.
But some of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance _
they were married secretly about a week earlier _ led to
speculation they may have eloped.
   Commander Ettore DiVito, who is heading the investigation, said
the book, ``Hidden Hawaii: The Adventurer's Guide'' was checked out
of the Wheaton library on March 29 and was found Saturday in St.
Paul.
   Although DiVito decline to chacterize the find as a
``breakthrough'' in the investigation, when he was asked whether
police believed the couple may have been in St. Paul and headed for
Hawaii, he replied: `It's a possibility. We're checking out both
possibilities.
   ``We're sending flyers to St. Paul, to the missing persons
division of their police department and we're making contact with
the appropriate authorities in Hawaii,'' DiVito said.
   Acquaintances have told police the two were saving money for a
trip before their disappearance, that Ms. MacLean had recently
purchased $600 worth of clothes and some excerpts found in her
diary were about trips to exotic locales.
   The couple was to have arrived at the Swanson family home in
Elgin the night of April 2 after visiting Ms. MacLean's grandmother
in Flint, Mich.

<HEAD>Officials Spot First Red Wolf Pups Born in the Wild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANTEO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two pairs of red wolves that were released
into the wilderness have produced pups _ a milestone in wildlife
officials' efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural
habitat, authorities say.
   The sightings of two wolf pups mark the first time that a
species previously extinct in the wild has successfully produced
offspring after being returned to its natural environment, said
Michael Phillips, a biologist at the Alligator River National
Wildlife Refuge near Manteo.
   The animals have been declared extinct in the wild since 1980.
   ``One pup has been seen six or seven times with its mother,''
Phillips said. ``Then we spotted another of the females with a pup
this past Saturday. This is great. It shows just how well the
animals have adapted.''
   Phillips said the first pup appeared to be about six weeks old;
the second about five weeks. Both appeared to be healthy.
   Alhough litters usually average five or six pups, there have
been no sightings to indicate that more than one survived from
either of the two litters, Phillips said.
   But Warren Parker, the coordinator for the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's red wolf project, was more hopeful. ``We can't
confirm it but we think there might be more pups that survived in
the second litter,'' Parker told the News and Observer of Raleigh.
   ``There are many hazards out there for a young pup to
confront,'' Parker said. ``Rattlesnakes, diseases, parasite
problems _ all sorts of things. It's a pretty hostile environment.''
   Parker said the second female had recently moved her litter
after her mate was hit by a car and killed May 29. ``Generally the
males provide the food for the first few weeks,'' he said. ``With
his death she's had to handle it all, so she just found a better
location.''
   After the pups are 7 months old, they'll get radio transmitters,
similar to the ones worn by the adult wolves to keep track of them.
   A vast population of red wolves once roamed the Southeast but
teetered near extinction in the late 1970s. In 1978, the last pure
red wolves were taken from the wild to a Tacoma, Wash., zoo, where
breeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducing
the animals into the wild.
   Since September 1987, four pairs of wolves have been released in
the Alligator Refuge in coastal North Carolina. In addition to the
death of the male wolf, two females have apparently died of natural
causes.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jimmy Swaggart's got a copyright on his
confession and his organization is not taking it lightly that the
Cincinnati Opera is promoting a production by using the minister's
public admission of sin.
   The radio commercial began airing today, opera officials said.
It promotes the opera company's June 30 and July 2 performances of
Carlisle Floyd's 1956 opera ``Susannah,'' in which an isolated
young woman is seduced by a hypocritical, backwoods Tennessee
preacher.
   In the commercial, the voice of Swaggart is heard to say: ``I do
not plan in any way to whitewash my sin. I have no one but myself
to blame.''
   Swaggart, a Louisiana-based television preacher, made the
statement during a February speech to his congregation. He never
specified the sin, but he was reported to have met several times
with a prostitute at a New Orleans motel to watch her perform
sexual acts. He has not denied those reports.
   ``We're looking into this to see if there's a violation of our
copyrights,'' said William Treeby, a New Orleans attorney who is a
board member of the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.
   ``We are not going to comment further, just examine it from a
legal standpoint. They don't have the right to use material that
we've copyrighted.''
   He said the ministries have copyrighted the Swaggart confession.
   A 10-second television spot produced for the opera company
re-enacts a scene from the opera in which Susannah, with her back
to the camera, bathes nude in a creek, while an announcer says,
``Susannah takes it off, and the elders can't bear it.''
   Patricia Beggs, Cincinnati Opera marketing director, said the
hint of sexual scandal was a natural in marketing the opera.
   ``This is so topical it's unbelievable, with Jimmy Swaggart,
Jessica Hahn, Jim and Tammy Bakker,'' Ms. Beggs said. ``It was sort
of a connection everybody was drawing.''
   The company hopes the advertisements will amuse and not offend,
she said.
   ``We certainly didn't do it with any malicious intent. We just
want to bring opera into range of focus of people's experiences,''
Ms. Beggs said.
   The radio advertisement, which was produced by Lawler Ballard
Advertising, used the clip from Swaggart's Feb. 21 public
confession, then followed it with the voice of announcer Gary
Stephenson saying: ``Lustful evangelists have gotten a lot of
publicity lately. But if you want to see the most lustful
evangelist of all, come watch the Rev. Olin Blitch try to convert
the beautiful but innocent Susannah to a life of sin and
degradation in Carlisle Floyd's all-American opera `Susannah' ...
probably the only great opera ever written that takes place in
Tennessee.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with voting postponed at one

<TEXT>
   One person was killed and several others
were injured today during a parliamentary election that will test
the power of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's main challenger.
   Election officials later postponed voting at one polling station
after allegations that loyalists of Gandhi's Congress Party tried
to rig ballots.
   The contest for a seat in the lower house of Parliament pitted
former Defense Minister V.P. Singh, a Gandhi ally-turned-foe,
against singer and film writer Sunil Shastri, of the governing
Congress Party.
   The battle between Singh, 56, and Shastri, 38, has been watched
closely as a measure of how Singh would do in a national contest
against Gandhi.
   The polling booth in the Satpura area of Allahabad did not open
today because of irregularities, election officials said. Balloting
was rescheduled for Friday. Officials gave no details.
   But Chander Amrit, a member of Singh's Jan Morcha political
group, said 15 armed men had raided the Satpura polling booth and
marked 800 ballots, most of them for the Congress Party candidate.
   One of Singh's supporters was shot and injured in a clash in the
village of Naini, 10 miles south of Allahabad, election authorities
said. He was identified as Narendra Pal Singh, a member of the
state assembly. He is not related to the candidate.
   In neighboring Haryana state, one person was killed and several
injured in clashes among factions at three villages, the Press
Trust of India reported. No details were available.
   Singh, running as an independent with the backing of most of
India's major opposition parties, was among the first to cast his
vote in Allahabad, 360 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   ``I voted for myself,'' he said. ``Who else is there?''
   Shastri was not eligible to vote because he is registered in his
home city of Gorakhpur, 120 miles northeast of Allahabad.
   More than 6.5 million voters in eight states were eligible to
vote in off-year elections for seven Parliament and 11 state
assembly seats.
   Lines formed outside the voting centers long before they opened
at 7:30 a.m. Polls were to close at 4:30 p.m., and final results
were expected late Friday or Saturday.
   Singh broke with the prime minister last year over the
government's hesitation to investigate alleged kickbacks in defense
contracts.
   Opposition parties and the press have alleged that government
officials and Gandhi cronies received kickbacks to facilitate the
purchase of Bofors artillery guns from Sweden and West German
submarines. Gandhi and his party have denied the charges.
   The Allahabad Parliament seat became vacant when film star
Agitabh Bachchan, a close friend of Gandhi, was forced to resign
because of allegations his brother may have been a conduit for
kickbacks. The Bachchan brothers have denied any wrongdoing.
   Shastri is the son of popular late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur
Shastri.
   Singh and Shastri are just two of the 68 candidates for the
Parliament seat, but only one other candidate, Kanshi Ram, is
considered a serious contender.
   Ram has championed the causes of the lower castes.

<TEXT>
   The top priority of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors will be to convince the presidential candidates that cities
need help, especially in the fight against drugs, the
organization's new president said.
   Mayor Arthur Holland of Trenton, N.J., was installed Wednesday
as the 45th president of the organization during the closing
session of its annual meeting.
   Holland, who succeeds Mayor Richard L. Berkley of Kansas City in
the two-year post, said Republican George Bush may have erred in
being the only presidential nominee to snub an invitation to
address the gathering.
   Michael Dukakis spoke to the mayors on Sunday and Jesse Jackson
appeared on Tuesday.
   Bush said a scheduling conflict prevented him from coming to
Salt Lake City, but he sent a detailed letter addressing the needs
of cities, Holland said.
   ``If I were Bush, I would want to be here, and not having been
here, I would want to talk to as many mayors as possible,'' said
Holland, a Democrat.
   Of the problems facing cities, the most serious is the use of
illicit drugs and the crime it spawns, Holland said during a news
conference.
   ``Number one is drugs. The problem of crack is overwhelming
us,'' Holland said.
   ``Almost all of our crime is drug-related,'' in Trenton, he
said. ``We simply don't have the resources to fight this.''
   Holland said the conference sent a telegram to Congress on
Wednesday asking for an amendment that would allow federal
anti-crime funds to be sent directly to cities for use in the war
on drugs.
   ``We haven't acted as though we are at war, and we must if we
are to conquer that which is conquering us,'' he said.
   After drugs, cities need federal help for mass transit, housing
and job training, said Holland.
   Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston, S.C., whose city will host next
year's annual meeting, said aid to cities has dropped sharply in
recent years. Riley said Urban Development Action Grants have been
reduced from a high of about $750 million in 1980 to $216 million
last year.
   However, the mayors didn't blame the Reagan administration.
   ``I fault the Congress,'' said Holland.
   Mayors attending the conference hailed Holland as a creative
urban leader and articulate spokesman for the nation's cities.
   Holland was elected mayor of Trenton in 1959 after serving on
the city commission. He was defeated in 1966, but reclaimed the
office in 1970 and has held it since then.

   Sunken treasure from two 17th century Spanish
galleons fetched $2.89 million at a two-day auction, with silver
bars selling for about twice their value as precious metal.
   The Nuestra Senora de Atocha and its sister ship, the Santa
Margarita, went down off the Florida Keys in a 1622 hurricane,
taking to the bottom booty collected from Spain's New World
colonies. Treasure hunter Mel Fisher and his team of divers located
and salvaged the wrecks of the two ships.
   Besides silver coins and bullion bars weighing up to 90 pounds,
Wednesday's auction at Christie's also featured a silver-gilt
rosewater dish that failed to sell during the main session Tuesday
night.
   The Spanish Ministry of Culture claimed the dish, which portrays
a Spaniard carrying a spear and blowing a hunting horn, for $49,500.
   Wednesday's session drew about 100 numismatic buffs and other
curiosity seekers, compared to 450 people Tuesday night.
   A 78-pound, 10-ounce silver bar from the Atocha, which yielded
the richest treasure haul ever found, sold for $14,300. An
extremely rare Philip IV coin from the mint of Santa Fe de Bogota
went within its presale estimate at $2,800. The last and smallest
silver bar _ a 1 pound, 4 ounce specimen estimated at $400 to $600
_ shot up to $3,300.
   Other silver bars hovered mostly in the $8,000 to $10,000 range.
   ``They're something you'd want for a souvenir _ but who would
want a lot of them?'' said Anthony M. Phillips, head of the silver
department at Christie's.
   Phillips said the bars would ``melt for about half'' of their
auction price.
   The showy, big-ticket items went Tuesday night, when the crowd
of onlookers included Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt and
actress Margot Kidder. Neither made a purchase.
   The Portuguese Navy Museum purchased two brass, mariner's
astrolabes used by the pilots of the ill-fated vessels. They went
for $132,000 and $83,000 Tuesday night.
   Phillips also said that a ``very rich, American private
(collector)'' had submitted the $319,000 bid Tuesday for a
62-inch-long Renaissance gold chain recovered from the Margarita.

   President Reagan says it would be
``ridiculous'' to assume that the Nicaraguan Sandinistas will
negotiate democratic reforms without military pressure from the
Contra rebels.
   Reagan on Wednesday reopened the possibility he will ask
Congress to approve new aid for the resistance fighters in the wake
of the collapse of peace talks with the Sandinistas.
   Both Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz hinted
strongly that they'll move for more aid, while Contra leaders met
with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to press their case.
   The administration has suffered a long series of setbacks in
Congress on the Contra aid issue. Officials this week have been
holding strategy meetings with the rebel leaders, and Reagan
discussed the issue Wednesday with several pro-Contra congressmen.
   In an interview with journalists from countries participating in
the seven-nation economic summit opening Sunday in Toronto, Reagan
was asked if military pressure was needed to get the collapsed
Nicaraguan peace talks back on track.
   ``I think it is so apparent that that is what is necessary, it
would be ridiculous for us _ for anyone _ to oppose it,'' he
replied.
   ``We went along with the peace plan that was agreed to among all
the Central American states, and to give it a chance. It is
apparent that the Sandinistas are not going to democratize.''
   He went a step further in the interview, excerpts of which were
released by the White House.
   If the United States wants the Sandinistas and Contras to
continue seeking a peace plan to go with the cease-fire agreed to
last March, Reagan said, ``we've got to restore the threat to the
Sandinistas _ that they must see that the people of Nicaragua do
have a force there that can be used to bring about an equitable
settlement.''
   Shultz, taking part in a pre-summit briefing at the White House,
said the peacemaking process ``needs an extra shove.''
   Administration officials had said previously they were wary of
advancing a military aid package since similar plans had been dealt
severe setbacks in recent months.
   But Shultz, when asked if the climate on Capitol Hill had
changed, replied, ``That is the general perception, that the
reality of the situation is beginning to sink in, and we can see it
in newspaper editorials, we can see it in the attitudes expressed
by members of the Congress.''
   ``Whether it has sunk in to the point where the results of a
vote would be changed, is yet to be seen,'' he said.
   The House on Feb. 3 defeated a proposal by Reagan for additional
military aid. U.S. assistance is now limited to a $48 million
humanitarian aid providing non-lethal supplies to the rebels.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan reassured the
pro-Contra legislators earlier Wednesday that he would not abandon
his attempt to aid the insurgents. But he conceded that ``we don't
have options at this point, in terms of any specific package.''
   Fitzwater said the administration was consulting with members of
Congress and that veteran diplomat Max Kampelman had been sent on a
special mission to discuss the situation with leaders of El
Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., said he and others sought the
meeting with Reagan out of a concern that the White House had given
up on the Contra issue after multiple setbacks earlier this year in
the House.
   ``It was necessary, I think, for some of us to point out that
with the Moscow summit and now the Toronto summit and a lot of
other things occupying the White House, that we thought it was
important that he keep the attention focused on Central America as
well,'' Edwards said.
   In the House on Wednesday, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and 145
cosponsors introduced a resolution calling on the president to
provide Congress with information on how the administration is
spending the humanitarian aid package approved in April.
   Panetta said he was concerned about cash payments being made
directly to the rebels without verification that the money was
being used for the non-lethal purposes Congress required when it
approved the assistance.
   Joao Baeana Soares, secretary general of the Organization of
American States, told an OAS meeting that ``the opportunity is
there'' to try to find a peaceful solution between the Sandinistas
and Contras.
   The Brazilian diplomat is an official observer at the peace
talks.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli soldier was shot
and slightly wounded in Nablus today, and troops rounded up
Palestinian suspects and clamped a curfew on the occupied West
Bank's largest city, the army said.
   It was the first instance of a soldier being shot since Sgt.
Moshe Katz, 28, was killed in the West Bank town of Bethlehem on
March 20.
   An Arab witness said the suspects were made to stand on one foot
while being questioned.
   Also today, dozens of Jewish settlers, some donning prayer
shawls, blocked a major West Bank highway for two hours to demand
harsh army action against Palestinian firebombers.
   And, President Chaim Herzog sharply criticized foreign news
media, blaming subconscious anti-Semitic motives for the
publication of ``half-truths and occasionally even worse than
blatant lies'' about Israel.
   The reserve soldier was traveling in his own car when he was hit
by a bullet, an army spokesman said. He added that it was not
immmediately known if the soldier was in uniform.
   The wounded soldier was taken by helicopter to a Tel Aviv
hospital and ``the circumstances of the injury are being
investigated,'' the spokesman said, refusing to elaborate.
   Troops began an immediate search for Arab suspects and the
weapon inside Nablus, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, according to
security sources. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Following the shooting, all drivers except Jewish settlers who
live nearby were stopped from entering or leaving Nablus. A United
Nations vehicle as well as one belonging to the Red Cross were
turned back.
   Some four hours after the shooting, about 60 cars were lined up
outside Nablus and an equal number were queued inside the city
waiting to pass a roadblock manned by three jeeploads of troops. A
helicopter hovered overhead.
   Arab witnesses said troops rounded up dozens of Palestinians and
fired shots in the air.
   ``It seems the army is very angry because this is the first time
I've seen them this strict. They are shooting in the air like
crazy,'' said Nablus businessman Said Kenaan.
   Abu Islam Deedi, an Arab reporter who lives in Nablus, said the
army set up about 10 roadblocks in the city center, rounded up
about 50 suspects and made them stand on one leg against a wall.
   Deedi, who said he could see the roundup from a window in his
home, said soldiers blocked all entrances to the city and stopped
and searched cars. He said several busloads of troops patrolled the
streets.
   Several Palestinians in Nablus said by telephone that they
became aware of trouble only when they heard Israeli troops telling
them over loudspeakers to stay indoors.
   ``A curfew is being imposed until further notice,'' the troops
said in Arabic. The blared order could be heard over the telephone
line.
   Since anti-occupation unrest began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, 208 Arabs have been killed. Two Israelis also have died.
   Palestinians have stepped up firebomb attacks, and PLO-linked
leaders of the Arab uprising have ordered them to stock up on food,
first aid and gasoline to prolong their resistance to Israel's
21-year occupation.
   About 60 settlers from the occupied West Bank's settlement of
Efrat used their cars to block the major Jerusalem-Hebron highway,
the route to jobs in Israel for thousands of Arab workers, Israel
radio reported.
   The army responded to the increase in firebomb attacks with
orders this week to shoot firebombers.
   Herzog, the former army intelligence chief, said world leaders
made decisions about Israel based on television newscasts which he
said contained ``a considerable degree of bias.''
   The 30-minute speech during a conference on Israel and the media
at Hebrew University in Jerusalem was Herzog's most critical
attack, but not his first, on the media. It underscored rising
Israeli criticism of foreign journalists triggered by wide coverage
of the violence.

<TEXT>
   Aides to the chief justice of the
Supreme Court said today he would resign, and 279 judges called for
a judicial system that would protect basic rights and be
independent of the executive branch.
   The aides said Chief Justice Kim Yong-chul would formally offer
his resignation Friday to President Roh Tae-woo.
   Opposition parties had called for a new chief justice to reform
the ``tarnished'' judiciary.
   On Wednesday, 85 junior judges called for sweeping judicial
reforms and an overhaul of the nation's highest court. It was the
first time in modern Korean history that judges staged a collective
action to support reforms.
   ``The judiciary is facing a crisis because it has done little to
reform itself despite high popular expectations for democracy,''
the judges said in a statement.
   Today, 194 more judges across the country issued statements
supporting the statement, and the number is expected to swell.
South Korea has a total of 940 judges.
   In a conference today, senior government and governing party
officials decided to accept Kim's resignation. But they expressed
regret over the judges' action, which they said would have a
serious political and social effect.
   The judges said the judiciary has failed to guarantee the Korean
people their basic rights, forcing them to promote such rights
``through their own sacrifice and effort.''
   The judges' action came as the government debated the makeup of
the Supreme Court to be formed according to a new constitution
written after widespread public protests last year.
   Kim, who took office in 1986, said earlier he had no desire to
cling to the post.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French woman said today that published
photographs of a deaf boy found wandering near Juarez, Mexico, have
convinced her the child is her grandson, Philippe.
   But social workers in El Paso, Texas, who are handling the case
say they are skeptical of the woman's claim because the boy appears
to be younger than the woman's grandson would be.
   Camille Muller contacted the U.S. Embassy in Paris on Tuesday
after recognizing the boy from pictures in a French television news
report. She said her daughter in Paris also was struck by the
resemblance.
   ``I pray it is he,'' she said. ``For me, it would be marvelous.''
   The freckled, brown-haired boy, known to authorities as Sabat,
was found in November. He suffers from severely impaired hearing
and was unable to identify himself or say where he was from.
   He communicates mostly by drawing pictures and gesturing and his
pictures seem to indicate he survived the crash of a four-seat,
single-engine plane that killed his parents, sister and brother.
   Mexican authorities noticed that Sabat preferred American food
and cartoon characters. They contacted Texas authorities for help,
and the FBI was called in.
   Sabat, so named because he was found on a Saturday _ sabado in
Spanish _ has been staying at a children's home in Juarez, across
the Rio Grande from El Paso.
   Terry Kincaid, FBI spokesman in El Paso, said he has received
several calls from people saying the boy resembles a missing
relative. But he took the French lead more seriously than most.
   Mrs. Muller saw copies of two drawings and seven photographs of
the child published today in the French magazine VSD.
   ``There is a great resemblance between the photos and
Philippe,'' said Mrs. Muller, in a telephone interview from her
home in the village of Le Bourg a Thibouville in Normandy. ``I have
more and more confidence that he is my grandson.''
   In addition, she said, ``the drawings are all signed with a `P,'
both those in the magazine and others described by VSD reporters
who saw them.''
   One of the drawings reproduced in the magazine shows a
stick-figure woman standing beside a small girl, a smaller boy and
the plane. Mrs. Muller said Philippe had a sister and a baby
brother born March 1986.
   Mrs. Muller's son moved to the United States after marrying an
American woman of Mexican descent, who had family in both Mexico
City and California. Her daughter-in-law taught biology at a school
in El Paso, although Mrs. Muller did not know where.
   She has not heard from her son since January 1987.
   Kincaid said he tried to ontact Mrs. Muller's son in El Paso,
but the man apparently had moved without leaving a forwarding
address.
   Mrs. Muller said her daughter-in-law's mother in Mexico City had
been very ill and possibly had died. She speculated that the family
could have been on their way to Mexico City at the time of the
plane crash.
   ``If it is Philippe, then evidently he is the only one left,''
she said. ``So while I hope it is really my grandson, I also hope
it is not him because that would mean that his parents and the
other two children are dead.''
   Juanita McCray, a social worker with the Texas Department of
Human Services, said, ``I'm excited but skeptical. The only problem
I have is the age.''
   Mrs. Mueller told embassy authorities that her grandson is about
12 years old. U.S. and Mexican authorities believe Sabat is about 7
or 8.
   Ms. McCray said officials planned to ask a doctor to X-ray the
boy's arms and legs as a way of getting a more precise estimate of
his age.

<HEAD>Operating Rates at Factories Rose to 82.9 Percent in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operating rates at American factories, mines
and utilities rose in May to 82.9 percent, the highest level in
more than eight years, the government said today.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the 0.2 percentage point rise
from the April level put operating rates at their highest levels
since March 1980, when the rate was 83.7 percent.
   It was the sixth increase in eight months. Operating rates rose
by 0.3 percentage points in April, after dropping 0.1 percent in
February and remaining unchanged in March.
   The May advance was led by gains in the production of autos and
parts, primary metals such as steel, and in fabricated metal
products. It was the third consecutive steep monthly rise at motor
vehicle and parts plants, where operating rates were 83.9 percent,
compared with 76.8 percent in February.
   Analysts had expected the modest rise in overall operating rates
after the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday that production levels
had increased 0.4 percent in May.
   Rising operating rates, if unchecked, are considered by analysts
to represent a threat of inflation. The concern is that prices will
rise if manufacturers have difficulty meeting demand.
   The May level of 82.9 percent was 3 percentage points higher
than the 79.9 percent rate a year ago, but analysts generally do
not consider the overall operating rate to be inflationary until it
reaches 85 percent.
   Rising capacity levels have been attributed to the surge in
exports caused by the devaluation of the dollar. But, so far
consumer demand in the United States appears to have been
restrained enough to allow manufacturers in most industries to
comfortably meet both domestic and foreign demand.
   In a speech in New York earlier this week, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said despite strained capacity in steel and
certain chemicals, statistics on industrial delivery times do not
indicate that inflationary bottlenecks are developing.
   Delivery times for production materials have moved up only
moderately since late 1985 and have stabilized, at least
temporarily, during the past five months, he said.
   The operating rate for manufacturing plants jumped to 83.1
percent in May, up from 82.9 percent a month earlier. Production of
durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more
years, rose by 0.6 percentage points to 81.6 percent, while the
rate for non-durable goods declined by 0.4 percentage points to
85.3 percent.
   The mining industry, which includes oil and gas drilling,
operated at 81.3 percent of capacity, down from 81.8 percent in
April. U.S. utilities operated at an 80.9 percent rate in May, up
from 80.4 percent.

<HEAD>Interior Delaying New England, Florida Offshore Leases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department will delay offering
oil and gas leases in federal waters off New England and Florida to
try to meet objections of the states involved, the department
announced today.
   It was the second time in two weeks that the department
announced postponements to try to settle controversies over its
drilling plans. Last week, a controversial sale off northern
California was delayed from February to at least October.
   Today's actions preceded scheduled deliberations by the House
Appropriations Committee on putting drilling prohibitions into the
department's appropriations bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1. A subcommittee approved the bans last week.
   Spokesman Bob Walker said Secretary Donald Hodel had written the
committee explaining the delays in an attempt to keep it from
enacting drilling bans in an appropriations bill, as it has done
several times before.
   The New England offering had been scheduled for February and now
will be delayed at least six months, Walker said.
   This delay will enable the department to put together a
negotiating committee with governors of the coastal New England
states. ``We think we have made some progress'' in forming such a
group to try to reach a compromise, Walker said.
   In an attempt to protect the shallow Georges Bank fishing
grounds, the subcommittee provision would forbid drilling in waters
less than 400 meters deep (1,312 feet). Walker said this would
``leave only the marginal areas'' available for leasing and ``might
leave us without a sale,'' as happened once before when no one bid
on areas left out of a previous prohibition.
   The Florida postponement involved 14 million acres in the
eastern Gulf of Mexico north of the Florida Keys up to about Naples.
   The area will be dropped from a scheduled offering of tracts in
the eastern gulf scheduled for November and will be offered
separately. The department announced no schedule for that second
offering. The governor's office in Tallahassee said under today's
agreement it could not occur before next May.
   In the meantime, two 14-member federal-state committees will
study oil spills and cleanup in the gulf.
   The subcommittee measure would forbid drilling in a slightly
larger area, about 16 million acres.
   It was the second deletion of substantial acreage off Florida in
an attempt to satisfy the state. Hodel ruled the areas around the
keys off limits in March.
   The subcommittee proposal also called for delaying the northern
California offering until October, in effect putting Hodel's delay
into law.

   Members of a convoy organized to bring
humanitarian aid to Nicaragua have vowed to take their fight to
Washington after U.S. Customs officials at the border blocked their
mission.
   ``What we are going to do is take them (the vehicles) to
Washington, D.C., and park them across the street from the White
House and hope to use them as a national rallying point for the
majority of Americans who oppose the war against Nicaragua,'' said
Gerry Condon, a national coordinator for the convoy.
   ``We'll probably be there for months,'' he said Wednesday.
   His sentiments were echoed by Hal Muskat, a convoy member from
San Francisco.
   ``We're pretty strong in our desire to take it to Washington,''
Muskat said this morning from the Alma de Mujer campground west of
Austin, where most of the group spent the night. He said convoy
leaders would meet today to plan the trip to Washington.
   Customs agents impounded four vehicles Wednesday after the
38-vehicle Veterans' Peace Convoy attempted to cross into Mexico
without export authorization.
   The 106 convoy members had planned to take 30 tons of food,
medical supplies and clothing to Nicaragua. But Treasury Department
officials served notice that leaving the 38 vehicles there would
violate a 3-year-old trade embargo.
   James Purser, chief customs inspector in Laredo, said he was
under orders from Washington not to allow the group's trucks, buses
and other vehicles out of the country.
   Charles Conroy, customs spokesman in Houston, said the detained
trucks will either be seized or returned to their owners pending
the outcome of an investigation.
   Sen. Phil Gramm supported the custom officials' action, saying
that the humanitarian aid could be used against U.S. interests in
the region.
   ``Unfortunately, the situation has made it obvious that while
much of the cargo they are carrying may constitute humanitarian
assistance, the trucks are destined for the Sandinista government,
where they could be pressed into service against those who are
fighting for their freedom in Central America,'' the Texas
Republican said.
   Convoy members and supporters from Mexico formed a human chain
to block traffic on the principal export bridge spanning the Rio
Grande, but a Mexican federal official quickly broke up the
blockade.
   Asked why the group did not try to take their humanitarian aid
across the border quietly, Condon said: ``This is a very public
thing. People around the country have been organizing for months. I
don't think we could have snuck across the border.''
   Raul Valdez, a convoy coordinator from Austin, said if the group
had not been stopped at the border, ``we never would have gotten
the attention that we have gotten in the media, for one thing, and
it has helped to bring people to realize that there is an
embargo,'' which he said many people oppose.
   The convoy left from four different regions of the United States
on May 21 and arrived in Laredo June 7. The vehicles have been
camped in Laredo since then.

   Turner Network Television and ``Gone With The
Wind'' will make their cable television debut together this fall.
   Ted Turner said his newest cable network will debut on cable
systems Oct. 3 with the film classic about the Old South.
   More than half of the network's 24-hour programming will be
drawn from the 3,301 MGM, RKO and pre-1950s Warner Bros. films
owned by Turner Entertainment Co., Turner announced Wednesday.
   The network will also offer original programming, which it
eventually will broadcast 200 to 250 nights a year, according to
Alex Swan, spokesman for Turner Broadcasting System.
   Jim Henson, who created ``The Muppet Show'' and ``Fraggle
Rock,'' will develop new programming for TNT, Turner said.
``Fraggle Rock'' currently is available only to subscribers of the
Home Box Office premium cable channel.
   TNT is already signed for cable systems serving more than 7
million subscribers around the United States, Swan said. That
compares to 44 million households for the 10-year-old WTBS
SuperStation, 46 million households for 8-year-old Cable News
Network and 31.5 million households for 6-year-old CNN Headline
News, all Turner broadcasting operations.

<HEAD>South Florida Federal Judges Strike Down U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by federal judges in southern Florida to
discard federal sentencing guidelines as unconstitutional has been
hailed by defense lawyers as bringing humanity back to the
courtroom.
   ``The guidelines were barbaric,'' said West Palm Beach lawyer
Richard Lubin, an area director of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``They turned the judges into
automatons.''
   Defense attorneys had argued the guidelines did not give judges
enough discretion in sentencing.
   Wednesday's 85-page opinion resulted from a rare ``en banc''
hearing of the Southern District of Florida's 16 federal judges,
held April 21.
   ``It's a very thorough and well-reasoned decision,'' said Benson
Weintraub, a Miami lawyer who spearheaded the arguments against the
guidelines.
   U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger, whose courtroom is in Fort
Lauderdale, said he didn't think the change would result in widely
different sentences.
   ``We'll just sentence on the old policy, that's all,'' Roettger
said. ``We have been sentencing as we have been for decades. All
we're doing is continuing that.''
   The guidelines were established by the seven-member U.S.
Sentencing Commission, set up by the 1984 Comprehensive Crime
Control Act, and applied to any offense comitted after Nov. 1, 1987.
   Written by U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus, the 12-4 opinion
finds the guidelines unconstitutional primarily because of the
composition of the sentencing commission.
   Because the commission includes three federal judges, the
separation of powers outlined in the U.S. Constitution is violated,
the judges said. Fixing punishments belongs to the legislative
branch of government and cannot be established by judges, the
opinion said.
   ``This collaborative rule-making effort between the judicial and
the executive branches of government cast too long a shadow over
the independence and impartiality of the entire federal
judiciary,'' Marcus wrote.
   ``We conclude that the act is unconstitutional, and until we
receive contrary guidance from a higher authority, the guidelines
will not be applied in this district.''
   Under the decision, those who are awaiting sentencing for
convictions or guilty pleas will be dealt with under the old
guidelines.
   Richard Gregorie, the chief criminal prosecutor in South
Florida's U.S. Attorney's Office, said the Justice Department will
ask that the guidelines remain in force while the decision is
appealed.
   Similar hearings have been held around the country with
conflicting opinions on the generally stricter sentencing
guidelines included in the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act.
   On Monday the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to step into the
dispute, and a decision by the high court is expected by early next
year, said John Steer, general counsel to the sentencing commission
in Washington.
   The guidelines allow sentencing judges to take into account the
nature of the crime, the grade of the offense, the amount of harm
caused, the community's view of the crime and the sentence's
deterrent value.

   Mari Maseng, the press secretary to Sen. Bob
Dole's unsuccessful campaign for the presidency, will replace Tom
Griscom as White House director of communications and planning, it
was announced today.
   Griscom will leave the White House on June 30, returning to
private life after 16 months of service.
   His job was to oversee the speechwriting staff, draw up
long-range agendas for the president and plan special events, such
as the superpower summits last December in Washington and earlier
this month in Moscow.
   Ms. Maseng served in the Reagan White House previously on two
occasions. She was a member of the speechwriting staff from 1981
until 1983, when she became assistant secretary of transportation
for public affairs.
   Ms. Maseng returned to the White House in 1986 as director of
the Office of Public Liaison, maintaining contact with
constituencies such as women, minorities, anti-abortion groups and
others.
   She left the White House to serve on Dole's staff as his press
secretary until his withdrawal from the race earlier this year.

   A heat wave baking much of the Northeast and Midwest persisted
into its fourth day today, aggravating a severe drought and causing
at least two deaths in Boston.
   Five tornadoes, meanwhile, spun through Colorado, hurling
vehicles through the air and injuring seven people.
   Temperatures reached the 80s in many areas of the East and
Midwest by late morning. At Louisville, Ky., the mercury rose from
83 degrees at 11 a.m. to 85 some 40 minutes later. Outside
Baltimore, it was 85 degrees at 11 a.m. with 67 percent relative
humidity. Boston was even hotter, recording 88 degrees.
   ``Have you seen the movie `Good Morning Vietnam?' Robin Williams
has a line in there that sums it up: `Hot, damn hot, hot and
wet,''' said Frank Ackerman, spokesman for the Cape Cod National
Seashore in Wellfleet, Mass.
   An estimated 196,000 people jammed beaches Wednesday in the New
York City area as the temperature hit 96 degrees, tying a
97-year-old record. It reached 98 in Boston, exceeding by 2 degrees
the record set in 1956.
   The bodies of an elderly woman and her daughter were found today
in their Boston apartment. A preliminary investigation indicated
the women died because of the heat, said police spokeswoman Jill
Reilly.
   In Massachusetts and Rhode Island the miserable weather became
an official heat wave, meaning at least three straight days of
temperatures at 90 or higher, the National Weather Service said.
   Kent County Memorial Hospital in Warwick, R.I., reported an
increase of people coming in with chest pains.
   ``We've had a lot of chest pains, which I'm sure are
precipitated by the heat,'' nursing supervisor Gertrude Bollengier
said today. She said no cases of heat exhaustion had shown up yet.
Rhode Island Hospital in Providence and Newport Hospital officials
reported no increase in heat-related illnesses.
   The unrelenting heat prompted Rhode Island Public Transit
Authority bus drivers to threaten a walkout over broken air
conditioners, as highs in Providence on Wednesday reached 97
degrees, one degree below the 1945 record.
   ``It's more than uncomfortable,'' said Edward Rodgers, president
of the drivers' union. ``It's a safety issue. What if a driver
passed out? ... It could be a catastrophe.''
   In Colorado, thunderstorms spawned five tornadoes in an area 55
miles long from north to south, tossing vehicles and storage sheds
through the air and tearing off several roofs. Seven people were
injured, none seriously.
   One twister hit near Denver's Stapleton International Airport,
where the air traffic control tower was evacuated for about 25
minutes, Stapleton spokesman Richard Bouleware said.
   Much of the property damage involved uprooted trees, lost
shingles and broken windows, rather than destruction of homes,
officials said.
   To the east, the severe heat is being caused by a high-pressure
system off the mid-Atlantic Coast pumping in hot air from the south
central part of the country, National Weather Service meteorologist
Mike Wyllie said.
   ``Over hundreds and hundreds of miles, the ground is very, very
dry,'' said Peter Lamb of the Illinois State Water Survey. ``So
what the sun is doing is heating the ground and the ground is
heating the air.''
   The heat, coming in the wake of a dry winter and spring in the
nation's midsection, aggravated widespread drought conditions that
have threatened farm yields, sending prices rocketing on commodity
exchanges.
   Efforts to cool off put extraordinary pressure on municipal
water and utility systems, and some communities began ordering
conservation. The heat, however, has not hurt the air conditioning
business.
   ``Sales have been going berserk,'' said Jack Van Horne, owner of
Arundel Cooling and Heating Co. Inc. in Linthicum, Md., near
Baltimore. ``When a heat wave moves in and units break down, people
want service and all hell breaks.''

   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on climate-environment:
   A distinguished group of international scientists worried about
the ``greenhouse effect'' that is changing the Earth's climate has
bounced the ball, appropriately enough, into the court of the
world's politicians. ...
   As gases from fossil fuel burning trap energy from the sun near
the Earth's surface, the globe gradually heats up. Over the next 50
years, the melting polar ice caps will raise the sea levels from 8
to 60 inches, the scientists predict.
   In the next century, the experts believe, people will endure
devastating floods and severe storms. Deserts will get even hotter.
Agriculture will suffer in some areas but be made possible in
others where now little can be grown, causing population shifts.
... Canada and Siberia will disappear, as will some species of life.
   With proper planning, mankind ought not be among them.
   The scientists suggest minimizing the damage by rapid
development of alternative energy sources and use of nuclear
energy, ending deforestation, and planning where to build dikes or
take other measures to protect coastal cities.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, on House ethics:
   House Speaker Jim Wright's problems on the ethics front have
taken a serious turn: By using a staff employee to help him write a
book, he may have violated the law as well as House rules.
   According to The Washington Post, Wright assigned a member of
his congressional staff in 1984 to work on the book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man,'' which so far has brought the speaker about
$55,000 in royalties.
   The employee, who is no longer on Wright's staff, was quoted as
saying that he spent about 200 hours on the book during office
hours.
   The book had a peculiar smell even before this revelation. It
was published by a friend who reportedly was paid more than
$250,000 by Wright's campaign committee for re-election services
performed during 1985-86. Wright received a 55 percent royalty on
book sales ... four to five times the normal payment to authors. ...
   The latest disclosure indicates that more than a House committee
inquiry is needed. The Justice Department ought to empanel a grand
jury to investigate whether Wright has broken the law by using a
staff member to work on the book.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on riots in South Korea:
   Anti-Americanism as displayed in the newest student riots in
South Korea is not to be ignored _ but we shouldn't make too much
of it either.
   By all indications most South Koreans remain good friends of the
United States, appreciative of the 1950-53 fighting to repel the
North Korean invasion, appreciative of our co-defense of the Truce
Line since that time, and appreciative of our help in bringing
about a democratic change in president this year.
   We feel the current demonstrations may be another manifestation
of the new democracy the Republic of Korea is enjoying, and not a
sign the roof is falling in.

   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on drugs:
   What makes illegal drugs a $120 billion industry in the United
States? The profit motive, of course.
   Thus, the government in its battle to close down the nefarious
industry, is about to embark on a program that may undermine that
motive by making it too costly for the consumer to be caught with
drugs in his or her possession.
   A group in the Congress has promised that after the Independence
Day recess legislation will be introduced to confiscate the
property of both drug users and drug dealers. Presumably this
legislation will extend to local law enforcement agencies the power
to confiscate any property involved in drug dealings of any kind.
   It all adds up to waging the equivalent of war to stop forces
that are undermining the very foundations of the nation; and if
confiscation is the only effective way to win the war, then that is
what must be done.

   The Hutchinson (Kan.) News on math scores:
   A federal inquiry into the extent of ignorance about math among
young students shouldn't surprise anyone in Kansas. ... Older
students are ignorant of math, despite years of concern. ...
   The schools have failed to help the unprepared older students.
Remedial training courses clearly have not been provided.
   In a few years the statistics about math ignorance among
students ought to look better.
   One reason for this statistical improvement will be the fact
that today's ignorant older students won't be there anymore. The
older ones of today then will be trying to function outside the
classrooms.
   But they'll still be ignorant, because school systems failed to
fix the problem and then lied to the student about his graduation
qualities.

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on drinking and driving:
   One of the best reasons to periodically pause to take stock of
accomplishments in the crusade against drunken driving is that
things may be going better than they seem.
   For all the tragedy continuing as a result of alcohol-related
crashes, and the 20,000 deaths annually, there's been progress.
   Just to start, the death toll is no longer rising substantially
every year. Public awareness has been stirred by victim advocate
groups. ...
   Many states have passed tougher laws the past decade. They're
raised the legal age for consumption of alcohol.
   Possibly as a result of these persistent methods of chipping
away at casual public attitudes, arrests are way up.

   The Los Angeles Herald Examiner on Jesse Jackson:
   Also-rans in the presidential primary marathon often are as
quickly forgotten as Super Bowl losers. Jesse Jackon, as in so many
other ways, is different.
   Michael Dukakis' victories, including his triumph in California,
made it certain that Jackson won't get the Democratic prsidential
nomination in 1988. But a loser? Not a chance.
   No, when the political history of this era is written, Jackson
will have a lead role, even if he accomplishes nothing more than he
did on the campaign trail in 1988. ...
   No one has brought more people into the process _ people who had
long since given up believing that their voices would be heard _
than Jackson. ...
   With charisma and hard work, Jackson has paved the way for a
black president, not this year, but in the near future. ...
   Although he's had little luck attracting many Democratic leaders
who will be attending the Atlanta convention as super-delegates,
Jackson is liable to be more successful in helping mold the 1988
Democratic platform.
   But after all which has come before, that will be a minor
triumph.
   Platforms are filed and forgotten. Jackson's already left a more
lasting mark _ on the history books.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on the death penalty:
   It has a nice sound to it: Drug dealers who kill people must die
themselves.
   Who among us can condone the actions of drug dealers, especially
those who've been convicted of killing someone. After all, the
drugs they deal often kill users even if the peddlers don't
actually do the killing.
   But voting to impose the death penalty on drug-murders offers
more sound _ and fury _ than enlightened law enforcement. Thus
we're unimpressed with the U.S. Senate vote (June 10) and hope more
rational minds in the House will block the action. ...
   Under the bill, the death penalty could be invoked if someone is
convicted of violating federal drug laws and separately convicted
of killing a police officer or private citizen.
   Arguments on the merits of a death penalty aside, we're
persuaded by Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., who said if senators are
serious about fighting drugs they should vote to spend more money
on educating potential users and arresting those who deal in drugs.

   Eager to conducts its own investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair, Congress last year granted immunity from prosecution to
several witnesses in exchange for their testimony.
   Now the chickens are coming home to roost in the courtroom of
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell.
   He has ordered separate trials for former White House aide
Oliver North and three other defendants _ a serious blow to the
strategy of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. ...
   Because of the legal complications incurred by the grants of
immunity and questions over use of classified information in a
public trial, the judge has hinted that the charges might have to
be dismissed.
   That wouldn't be a bad idea.

   Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader on House ethics:
   Democratic members of Congress frequently criticize the dealings
of Attorney General Edwin Meese and other members of President
Reagan's Republican administration.
   Now, members of the Democratic majority in the House find
themselves in the embarrassing position of having to defend their

   Wright has denied any wrongdoing. At best, however, some of his
actions appear highly questionable.
   A thorough investigation of those activities is not only
appropriate but a matter of congressional duty.
   Congress has demanded repeatedly that members of President
Reagan's team avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Congress

   The Lafayette (Ind.) Journal and Courier on the drought:
   Nothing is as humbling as coming face to face with the fact that
despite all of our technology, we remain at the mercy of the
natural elements.
   All forms of natural disasters remind us of this: hurricanes,
earthquakes, tornadoes and flood.
   As we look around the Midwest, we see unfolding yet another of
nature's leveling influences. What started as a troublesome dry
spell in May has met or surpassed the pessimism of those who early
on predicted the worst drought since the Dust Bowl days. ...
   As we wait and pray for rain, let's not focus only on the bad
that the drought produces but the good as well.
   There is the breaking down of barriers between segments of the
community. There is the inward reflection on an individual basis
that promotes personal growth.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on acid rain cleanup:
   The details of an acid rain plan worked out by the governors of
New York and Ohio are less imnportant than the fact that an
agreement has been worked out at all.
   For Ohio to agree to any significant cleanup proposal at all is
a significant breakthrough, since coal-fired plants and other
industries there emit more sulfur dioxide than any other state in
the nation. ...
   Under the New York-Ohio plan, the federal government would put
up $900 million a year in cleanup funds (most of it to come from an
oil import fee) and $900 million would come from the polluters. ...
   Maine's Sen. George J. Mitchell, who has been leading the fight
for comprehensive acid rain legislation for years, calls the New
York-Ohio agreement ``encouraging.''
   Mitchell predicts it will pave the way for enactment of an acid
rain bill this year. If so, that's progress indeed.

   The Asbury Park (N.J.) Press on Reagan's slur of native
Americans:
   During a give-and-take session ... at Moscow University, one
student challenged (President Reagan) to address American Indian
grievances.
   (Reagan) proceeded to tick off all the wonderful things European
immigrants and their descendants have done for the Indian:
Reservations covering millions of acres, a Bureau of Indian
Affairs, education, a chance for some to get very rich pumping oil.
   The president's history lesson left out the broken treaties, the
forced expulsions, the outright theft of property, the loss of a
whole continent and the lingering legacy of disease, poverty and
joblessness.
   Nor could Reagan's myth of America as a shining city on a hill
acknowledge the Trail of Tears, in which 70,000 Indians died as
they were thrown off their lands and pushed across the Mississippi
River.
   The Soviet occupation of the nations of Eastern Europe, the
Baltic and Eurasia has had ghastly consequences. But there has been
little benign about the European occupation of land that belongs to
native Americans.
   Reagan's decision to dwell on the former while suppressing the
latter discredits his message.

   A district judge today rejected a request
by Union Carbide Corp. that he remove himself from the Bhopal gas
disaster case because he showed bias against the company.
   ``Such a procedure is unheard of in trial courts in this
country, where the normal course is to approach the high court for
transfer of the suit,'' Judge M.W. Deo said.
   Union Carbide's lawyers on May 6 asked Deo to remove himself
from hearing India's $3 billion suit against the U.S.-based
multinational company. They said that Deo's order on Dec. 17 for
Union Carbide to pay ``interim relief'' to the gas victims showed
bias because he had not ruled on the merits of the case.
   Nearly 3,000 people were killed and at least 20,000 people were
seriously injured when toxic methyl-isocyanate leaked from a
pesticide-producing subsidiary of Union Carbide in Bhopal on Dec.
3, 1984.
   The Indian government is suing for damages in the gas leak, the
world's worst industrial accident.
   India has accused Union Carbide of negligence. Union Carbide
contends the accident was caused by sabotage.
   Deo set June 29 as the next date for a hearing on the damage
suit.
   Deo's December order was upheld in April by the Madhya Pradesh
High Court, which set the amount of payment at $192 million.
   Today, UnionCarbide attorney Fali Nariman argued that the order
for relief payments was made ``without any finding of liability and
without there being any material at all to indicate how the figure
... was arrived at.''
   He added that there was nothing in the order to allow refund of
the relief payments should the government lose the suit or final
adjudication set a lower liability figure.
   Bhopal is the capital of the central Indian state of Madhya
Pradesh.

   Norway has opened a $15.5 million tourist

top of Europe.
   On the rare days when the fog lifts, the center in the
1,000-foot-tall cliff on Mageroey island offers a panoramic view of

window.
   The center also offers an audio-visual presentation on northern
Norway, a 250-seat restaurant and the world's northernmost bar. On
the clifftop is a domed telecommunications center.
   North Cape attracts about 100,000 tourists during the summer.
   After nearby Knivskjellodden, North Cape is Europe's
northernmost point.
   The cape was named in 1553 by Richard Chancellor, a British
navigator who two years later was lost in a shipwreck off the coast

   A court on Thursday sentenced a Greek
chemist to four months in jail for throwing a tomato at Turkish
Premier Turgut Ozal's car.
   The incident occurred Wednesday on the last day of Ozal's
official visit to Greece, the first by a Turkish premier in 36
years.
   ``I did it because I felt a kind of sacred anger at the
provocation of Ozal's presence in Greece. I've never done such a
thing before,'' Theodoros Binichakis, 42, told the three-member
court before he was sentenced.
   The tomato splattered across the windshield of Ozal's limousine
as it took him back to his hotel after a call on President Christos
Sartzetakis.
   Binichakis was arrested by police on a charge of ``unprovoked
insult.''
   Ozal and Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou said Ozal's visit was
designed to improve relations between the traditionally hostile
NATO allies.

   A man who foiled a bank holdup says he
hoped he'd impress the two police officers who took him under their
wing when as a teen-age gang member he witnessed a fatal shooting.
   ``I was hoping those guys would be proud of me,'' said Jim
Sperow, 25, who on Wednesday was called a hero by police.
   Sperow chased a suspected Wells Fargo Bank robber down the
street, tackled him in an alley and bashed his head with the man's
.44-caliber Magnum revolver. ``Those two cops straigtened me out
and got me on the right track,'' Sperow said after Tuesday's
incident. ``I was just glad I could do something to try to pay them
back.''
   Homicide inspector John Fotinos, one of the two officers, said
he was heartened to learn what Sperow had done, 11 years after
Fotinos and his partner tried to help him out.
   ``You tend to lose track of these kids, so it's great to learn
now that maybe we did a little bit of good,'' he said.
   Sperow's tackle of one suspect and description of another
resulted in the arrest of the two men and the recovery of $52,527,
police said.
   Michael Jameson, the arresting officer, was one of several
policemen who praised Sperow for his bravery.
   Sperow, who works at a print shop, was at the bank, waiting in
line, ``when when a guy jumped over the counter yelling: `It's a
holdup! It's a holdup!''' he said. ``I said to myself, `Wow! Here
we go.'''
   He, the other customers and the tellers watched as one suspect,
identified by police as Robert Michael Linsey, 41, of San Martin,
scooped money from cash drawers into a bag.
   The other suspect, later identified by police as Joe Dewayne
Duke, 41, stood by the door brandishing a revolver.
   Sperow took off after the men when they fled. He tackled Duke
and brought him to the ground, he said.
   ``I figured it was better to go for the guy with the gun. If I
went for the guy with the money I might have gotten shot,'' he said.
   A crowd gathered but nobody offered to help. Sperow managed to
get the gun away from the suspect, then hit him in the head with
the revolver.
   Police pulled up shortly afterward. About four hours later,
police arrested Linsey.
   Later, Sperow, who has a wife and 1{-year-old daughter, recalled
his days as a member of the Hunters Point gang. ``I was a punk,
someone who was on the wrong track,'' he said.
   At 14, he witnessed a drugstore robbery in which a guard was
shot dead.
   The two homicide investigators, Fotinos and Carl Klotz, got
Sperow into the John O'Connell School of Technology, where he has
earned his degree.

   Call it conservation chic: The latest trend
in California cusine is the waterless meal.
   There's more than civic spirit at work, however. In Los Angeles,
an ordinance that took effect at the end of April requires
restaurants to serve water on request only. But even outside city
limits, many restaurateurs are voluntarily turning off the tap.
   ``You think about it because of the fires,'' said Donna Averna,
manager of Splash, a bistro in the seaside celebrity community of
Malibu, where drought also brings the threat of devastating brush
fires.
   Posh celebrity hangout Spago in West Hollywood is voluntarily
dry, as are the Brown Derby in Pasadena and Chasen's in West
Hollywood, an old favorite of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
   The conservation effort gets a boost this week, as the region's
biggest water supplier mails out 200,000 cards to more than 2,000
restaurants to post on tables, outlining the water-on-demand policy.
   The cards bear a picture of a water glass, one-quarter full, and
the caption, ``What, no water?'' On the back is an explanation that
for each serving of water, it takes three to four times that amount
to wash the glass.
   That's a small but important bit of conservation, with rain and
snow runoff in the Sierra Nevada, source of much of the state's
water, at one-half or less of normal levels, said Metropolitan
Water District spokesman Tim Skrove.
   The MWD, wholesale supplier to water districts serving 14
million people throughout Southern California, paid the $13,000 for
printing and mailing the restaurant cards, Skrove said.
   The California Restaurant Association supplied the mailing list
and is urging members to comply, said Stan Kyker, executive vice
president.
   The benefits of pulling water glasses off the tables, Kyker
tells members, are twofold. Not only do they save water and set an
example, they also save money by washing fewer dishes.
   ``It's your obligation to do your role,'' Kyker tells
restaurateurs, ``and besides that, it'll save you money.''
   The initial response has been good.
   Diners don't usually complain once they find they can get water
by asking, said Ms. Averna and Harry McCague, general manager at
the Brown Derby.
   But conservation chic isn't for everyone.
   Stylish Le Dome in West Hollywood wouldn't dream of asking its
patrons to sacrifice.
   Manager Michelle Ritz puts it simply but firmly: ``We always
serve water, sir.''

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
visit Poland sometime between July 10-20, the two governments
announced Thursday.
   Gorbachev was invited by Wojciech Jaruzelski, leader of the
Polish United Workers (communist) Party, according to statements by
the Polish state-run PAP news agency and the Soviet news agency
Tass.
   Polish officials have said Gorbachev will visit several cities
and attend a meeting of Warsaw Pact leaders in Warsaw.
   There was no mention of a Warsaw Pact meeting in Thursday's
official announcements. Besides the Soviet Union and Poland, the
pact includes East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria.
   Gorbachev has visited Poland twice before, for a Warsaw Pact
summit in 1985 and for Poland's Communist Party Congress in 1986.

<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-Wedtech president testified that company
officials met with George Bush in an effort to cut out competitors
for government contracts, but a Bush spokesman said the vice
president doesn't remember meeting them.
   Anthony Guariglia, the former president of the now-defunct
defense contractor, also testified in Rep. Mario Biaggi's
racketeering trial that Wedtech officials gave $200,000 to
President Reagan's 1984 campaign.
   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times reported today that allegations
against a Wedtech competitor contained in memos to Attorney General
Edwin Meese III by a friend, Wedtech consultant Robert Wallach,
bear a striking similarity to language contained in a highly
critical report on the company later issued by the Army.
   However, no link between Meese and the investigation of
Houston-based Garcia Ordnance Corp. has been documented, the
newspaper said.
   Wallach was indicted on charges that he accepted hundreds of
thousands of dollars from Wedtech in an improper attempt to
influence Meese on behalf of the defunct New York defense
contractor. Wallach is scheduled to be tried with two associates
later this year.
   Garcia Ordnance is not mentioned in Wallach's indictment.
   In his testimony in federal court, Guariglia said that
competitors from Texas and Puerto Rico disappeared after the
company officials were introduced to Bush.
   ``Was the purpose of being introduced to Vice President Bush to
get him to eliminate Wedtech's competition in Texas and Puerto
Rico?'' defense attorney Alan R. Kaufman asked during cross
examination.
   ``Yes,'' said Guariglia.
   ``Was that done? Was that competition eliminated?'' Kaufman
asked.
   ``Yes,'' responded Guariglia, ending the exchange without
specifically connecting Bush to the diminished competition.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart said, ``The vice president doesn't
recall meeting (Guariglia) on any occasion. And if he spoke to him,
no action was taken up to follow up on their conversation.''
   Guariglia made his statements during cross-examination late
Tuesday by Kaufman, who continued his questioning of the company
official on Wednesday.
   On trial are Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six co-defendants accused of
converting Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise for the payment
of bribes to obtain millions of dollars in no-bid contracts.
   According to Guariglia, another Wedtech official, Mario Moreno,
told him that New York state Republican Chairman George Clark
offered to help the company acquire a lucrative government bridge
pontoon contract in return for a $200,000 campaign contribution.
   ``Was the money paid?'' asked Kaufman, representing defendant
Ronald Betso.
   ``The monies were collected from various vendors, members of the
team, myself. All the officers of Wedtech made contributions to
Ronald Reagan totaling $200,000,'' Guariglia said.
   ``Was it money well spent?'' continued Kaufman.
   ``I do not know,'' replied Guariglia, the fourth and last
official of the South Bronx firm scheduled to testify. Moreno
testified earlier in the trial for the prosecution.
   Guariglia, in his fifth day of cross-examination, then testified
that Clark introduced him and several other Wedtech people to Bush.
   Clark, in a telephone call from Newport, R.I., said Wednesday
he'd never even met Guariglia: ``I wouldn't now him if he walked
past me now.'' As for the witness' charges, Clark said, ``I
absolutely, categorically deny doing anything on their behalf or
having any conversation about $200,000.''
   Defense lawyers are trying to demonstrate Wedtech's government
contracts were the result of its many Washington connections and
not its ties with the defendants.
   Toward that end, an assortment of names connected with the
Reagan administration, including Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
former adviser Lyn Nofziger and ex-National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, have surfaced during the 14-week trial.
   The defendants are Biaggi, his son Richard, and the others _
Wedtech founder John Mariotta, ex-Bronx Borough President Stanley
Simon, attorney Bernard Ehrlich, Small Business Administration
Regional Administrator Peter Neglia and Neglia friend Betso.
   Guariglia and three other Wedtech officials have pleaded guilty
to corruption charges and agreed to testify at the Biaggi trial in
exchange for leniency. Guariglia, 37, testified he could still
receive a 10-year prison term despite his testimony.

<HEAD>Bush Veep List Includes Dole _ Both of Them</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One in a series of occasional stories about vice presidential
prospects</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a city where power is spelled with a
capital ``P'' the Doles _ Bob and Elizabeth _ are the
quintessential Power Couple, a status confirmed by the likelihood
that both are on George Bush's list of vice presidential prospects.
   A Bush-Dole ticket sounds good to a lot of people. The question
is, which Dole?
   The husband is the Senate Republican leader who finished second
to Bush in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.
   The wife is a former transportation secretary and Federal Trade
commissioner who won favorable reviews as a campaigner for her
husband when he was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 1976 and
during his two later bids for the presidential nomination
   Dole the senator is strongest where Bush is weakest _ in the
Farm Belt, where he thrashed Bush in Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota,
and Minnesota. Polls also show Dole running better among
independents and Democrats than does Bush.
   Dole the former transportation secretary also helps Bush in an
area where he needs it _ among women. Recent polls show a gender
gap for Bush that looks more like a chasm, with the vice
president's rating among women running almost 20 points below his
standing among men.
   ``I think it would clearly help Bush among women,'' said
Patricia Ireland, a vice president of the National Organization for
Women, when asked the impact of having Elizabeth Dole on the ticket.
   When Bob Dole was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 1976, the
Secret Service code names for the couple were Ramrod for the
candidate and Rainbow for his wife.
   Those names seem particularly well-chosen in the light of events
during and since that campaign.
   The Kansas senator has earned a reputation as a tough, acerbic
campaigner, whose most memorable moment in the 1988 contest was the
night of his New Hampshire primary loss when he was asked if he had
anything to say to Bush.
   ``Tell him to stop lying about my record,'' snarled the senator.
   A native of Salisbury, N.C., Elizabeth Hanford Dole is a
Harvard-educated lawyer who came to Washington in the 1960s as a
staff assistant in the old Department of Health, Education and
Welfare. She worked in the White House office of Consumer Affairs
under President Lyndon B. Johnson and was named to the Federal
Trade Commission by President Richard M. Nixon.
   She worked as a special assistant for public liaison in the
Reagan White House and, in February 1983, she was named secretary
of transportation.
   She resigned in September 1987 to do ``everything I can'' to
help her husband get elected president.
   ``I'm from Russell, Kansas, and proud of it,'' Bob Dole told
campaign audiences. It was an especially effective appeal to
Midwestern Republicans, as were the terrible wounds he suffered in
World War II which left him without the use of his right arm.
   He was elected to House in 1960 and to the Senate in 1968. In
addition to serving in the Senate, he was chairman of the
Republican National Committee from 1971 through 1973, and the early
days of the Watergate scandal. Dole was succeeded in the party post
by Bush.
   When President Gerald Ford picked the wisecracking Dole as his
running mate in 1976, the choice surprised many people. His
slashing campaign style surprised even more. He later said he was
sent ``into the briar patch while he (Ford) stayed in the Rose
Garden.''
   The low point came during a vice presidential debate with Walter
F. Mondale, when Dole referred to American lives lost in ``Democrat
wars.''
   The Kansas senator bid for the top spot on the ticket in 1980
and vowed to run a positive campaign. He did, but he got few votes
and was an early casualty.
   His fortunes took a positive turn in 1980 when the Republicans
captured control of the Senate in the Reagan landslide. Dole soon
was getting rave reviews as chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee and in 1985 he succeeded Howard H. Baker as Senate GOP
leader.
   He still had his eye on the White House and after a big victory
in Iowa in February 1988 appeared on his way to the nomination. But
Bush turned it around in New Hampshire, helped by television
commercials that portrayed Dole as waffling on arms control and as
a supporter of tax increases.
   Beaten everywhere by Bush on Super Tuesday, Dole never recovered
and dropped out of the GOP race on March 29.
   Elizabeth Dole often was credited with moving her husband away
from the slashing style he displayed in the 1976 campaign, but the
``old'' Bob Dole often reappeared this year.
   During the Illinois primary campaign, Dole said Bush had ``sort
of had a charmed life in politics. He's gotten quite a ways without
ever doing much.''
   That kind of talk might make it likely that the Dole on a
Bush-Dole ticket would be named Elizabeth.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright said today he would
welcome the hiring of an outside investigator by the House ethics
committee if that would speed up the panel's probe of his financial
dealings.
   Wright, D-Texas, reacting to President Reagan's call for an
independent counsel in the case, said, ``I have frequently said it
is all right with me for the committee to do whatever it will.''
   ``If the committee feels its work can be expedited by hiring of
an outside counsel, then by all means,'' he told reporters. He
declined to comment directly on Reagan's remarks, including the
president's incorrect assertion that Democrats controlled the
ethics committee, saying, ``I'm going to be kinder to the president
than he was to me.''
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the next ranking
Democrat after Wright, said Reagan apparently was ``confused'' and
had aligned the White House with ``politically motivated''
Republicans.
   Foley said that continued Republican pressure against Wright is
``a politically motivated attack on the speaker, designed to ...
theoretically balance the problems the administration has had with
ethics, and even criminal problems.''
   Foley, speaking on CBS-TV's ``This Morning,'' said the criticism
of Wright is ``linked to such things as sort of crass fundraising
efforts for the Republican Party.''
   Reagan, becoming the latest GOP officeholder to join the verbal
fray over allegations Wright has violated House ethics rules, said
Wednesday that ``everyone would feel that it was more proper'' if
an investigation were done by someone outside Congress.
   The bipartisan House ethics committee voted last week to
investigate allegations the speaker misused his office for personal
gain.
   Reagan, speaking to reporters, said, ``I have to wonder if it
should not be an independent counsel from the standpoint of the
relationship of the speaker to the majority of the committee. And I
think everyone would feel that it was more proper if it was done by
an investigator outside _ an appointed investigator.''
   Said Foley, ``there's a confusion over the president's
terminology and his comments about the committee.''
   ``The president said he thought it was especially important
because of the majority. This is an even committee _ six Democrats,
six Republicans,'' said Foley. ``None of the Democrats (were)
appointed originally by this speaker. They're people of high
integrity; that's why they're put on the committee.''
   The committee is looking into allegations that Wright, D-Texas,
has violated House ethics rules by misusing his office for personal
gain and improperly intervening with federal regulators.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who first raised the allegations,
Vice President George Bush and several other GOP officeholders have
suggested that it would be better to have the investigation
conducted by an independent counsel.
   Reagan made the remarks during an interview with seven reporters
from the seven countries that will participate in the economic
summit June 19-21 in Toronto.
   Wright is accused of six possible violations of House rules but
has denied any wrongdoing.
   The accusations include improper lobbying on behalf of oil
companies with which Wright may have had financial relationships,
circumstances surrounding publication of a book for which he
received a higher-than-usual royalty and which was produced with
the help of a congressionally paid staffer, contacts with federal
officials on behalf of Texas savings and loans and the use of a
condominium in Fort Worth for which he paid no monthly rent.

   After more than four decades of dusty travels
entertaining fans around the minor leagues, the ``Clown Prince of
Baseball,'' Max Patkin, is getting a chance to show his antics on
the big screen.
   Patkin, 68, plays himself in his motion picture debut in ``Bull
Durham,'' a baseball comedy opening in theaters this week.
   ``More people will know who I am, and that feels pretty good,''
said Patkin, who lives in the Philadelphia suburb of King of
Prussia.
   Patkin's acting career began in the 1940s, when an injury ended
the young pitcher's dream of playing in the big leagues. He still
made it _ but as a baseball clown, contorting his face and
prominent nose while mimicking baseball people with exaggerated
gestures.
   Writer-director Ron Shelton caught Patkin's act in the early
1960s while Shelton was a second baseman in the minors.
   ``He was just a kid,'' Patkin recalled. ``We palled around a
little bit back then, and years later, he wrote me into the film.''

   Timothy Busfield, who stars in
ABC-TV's ``thirtysomething,'' says he never wanted to be a
television actor while he was growing up.
   ``I saw `Goldfinger' when I was about 7 and I thought, `That's
it. I want to be James Bond.' But I never got a chin, so I knew
that was out,'' said Busfield during a visit Wednesday to East
Tennessee State University, where he majored in acting.
   A baseball career also interested him, but Busfield said he was
too small.
   Busfield said he wound up in television after he found he
enjoyed television more than theater after bit roles on the tube
that included the son of ``Trapper John, M.D.''
   Busfield, 31, who plays Elliott on ``thirtysomething,'' recently
set up a scholarship fund at East Tennessee State that offers
aspiring young actors $500 each.

of soft drink inspired him to write the tune ``All Shook Up,''
which Elvis Presley recorded more than 30 years ago.
   Blackwell said music publisher Goldy Goldmark used to tell him,
`` `You can write about anything. Write about this!' And he shook a
bottle of soda.''
   Blackwell went home and wrote ``All Shook Up.''
   ``I just wanted to show him I could do it,'' he said.
   His other hit compositions include ``Handy Man,'' ``Great Balls
of Fire,'' ``Fever'' and ``Return to Sender.''
   Blackwell, who has lived in New York City much of his life, has
just opened a publishing company, a small recording studio and a
record company in Nashville.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis today picked up
the endorsement of former rival Albert Gore Jr., who predicted that
the likely presidential nominee will capture the backing of the
South's conservative electorate.
   ``On occasion, Mike and I had differences but out friendship
always grew and our debates helped strengthen the Democratic Party
and increase the Democrats' chance of victory in the fall,'' the
Tennessee senator said in a statement he was to deliver later today.
   Gore, one of four recent opponents to endorse Dukakis, said the
Massachusetts governor ``is going to carry our party to victory in
November. He is going to win in the East, in the North, in the
West, and he is going to win right here in the South.''
   ``Our part of the country spoke for change on Super Tuesday and
Mike Dukakis stands for change,'' said Gore, who planned to call on
his 289 delegates to back the Massachusetts governor at the
Democratic National Convention in July.
   Dukakis was using the Gore endorsement to kick off a trip
through seven Southern states, many of them once considered secure
for Bush.
   ``Dukakis can win Florida,'' said Charles Whitehead, the state's
Democratic Party chairman. ``I think Florida is the hardest state
for any Democrat to win of any Southern state.''
   But, said Whitehead, Dukakis is ``not being perceived as a
liberal. He's a progressive, a middle-of-the-roader.''
   At the same time, the Democratic chairman said, Bush is
perceived ``as a follower, not as a leader.''
   In the final round of primaries last week, Dukakis surpassed the
2,081 delegates he needed for a majority, but Jesse Jackson has
vowed to remain in the race for the nomination until the votes are
counted at the convention.
   Gore dropped out of the race after the New York primary in which
he finished a disappointing third in a field of three. The
Tennessee senator had pursued a Southern strategy for the
nomination, downplaying the traditional early tests in Iowa and New
Hampshire and hoping to benefit from a flood of Dixie votes on
March 8.
   Gore did well on March 8, but then failed to attract much
support in such Northern states as Illinois, Wisconsin and New York.
   For Dukakis, as with all Democratic presidential candidates, the
South is a critical part of the coalition needed to attain the 270
electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
   In the last five presidential elections, the only Democratic
winner was Jimmy Carter of Georgia who carried 10 of 11 Southern
states.
   Bush took command of the race for the Republican presidential
nomination by winning 16 primaries on March 8, most of them in the
South.
   Strategists for the vice president, a New Englander who now
claims Texas as his home, consider the region his base, a claim
disputed by Dukakis.
   ``Mike Dukakis knows he can win states in the South and he's
going to campaign actively there,'' said Leslie Dach, a Dukakis
campaign spokesman. ``While George Bush has a lot of homes, he has
no secure political base and he's going to have to campaign
everywhere.''
   Dukakis' three-day foray into the region was to include stops in
Tennessee, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas
and Alabama.
   He won the Florida and Texas primaries on March 8. Gore carried
Tennessee, while Jackson was the winner in Alabama and South
Carolina.
   Most Southern Democrats were openly urging Dukakis to choose
someone like Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
or Sen. Robert Graham of Florida from the region as his running
mate.
   ``The decision on the vice presidency will be fundamental,''
said Wayne Bailey, a professor of political science at Stetson
University in Deland, Fla., and a Democratic Party activist.
   The seven states where Dukakis was campaigning have a total of
95 electoral votes, the biggest prizes being Texas with 29 and
Florida with 21.
   The Massachusetts governor is given little chance of beating
Bush in the most conservative of the Southern states.
   ``I honestly don't expect him to take Alabama,'' said Natalie
Davis, a pollster based in Birmingham. ``Bush is going to have to
lose it.''
   One theme Dukakis was sounding that is welcomed by Southern
voters was a tough stand against crime and drugs.
   During appearances in his home state on Wednesday, Dukakis
touted the declining Massachusetts crime rate and lambasted the
Reagan administration for obstructing the war on drugs by cutting
Coast Guard funds.
   ``How can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs
when we're cutting Coast Guard patrols by 55 percent?'' he told
reporters outside the state police academy. ``It's that kind of
thing _ one of the reasons I'm running for the presidency.''

   Vice President George Bush said today drugs
are ``the ultimate fatal attraction'' and he renewed his call on
companies to institute anti-drug programs in order to receive
federal contracts.
   ``The point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just
a profit and loss issue, it's a matter of protecting the health and
safety of workers. It's no less important than OSHA regulations on
the conditions of machinery,'' the certain Republican presidential
nominee told the U.S. Jaycees annual meeting.
   ``The federal government should not dictate what kind of
drug-free program a company should have, but it should require any
federal contractor to have one in place,'' he said.
   As in the past, Bush left open the question of whether these
programs must include some form of mandatory drug testing.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Bush
suggested that many Americans still don't know ``who I am'' despite
7{ years as vice president. He said he would rely heavily on
advertising and surrogate speakers to help get his message out.
   Bush also said he may select a woman as a running mate.
   And he blamed some of his high negatives in recent public
opinion polls on Democrats ``shooting at you every day'' during the
just-ended primary season.
   ``I think we have time to be sure that a positive image is out
on who I am and what I feel and where I'll take the country. And
I'll readily concede that some of that's not clear yet,'' he said.
   ``I think the answer on the polls, if there are negatives there,
is to turn them into positives,'' Bush said.
   On the subject of a running mate, Bush said that the
vote-drawing ability of an individual to help him in the polls
``would be a factor _ man or woman'' in the selection. However, he
says his primary consideration remains a capability to take over in
the event something happened to the president.
   ``Look, the gender question was crossed when Geraldine Ferraro
went on the (1984 Democratic) ticket,'' he said. ``And that was a
good thing, a very good thing.''
   Among those women mentioned prominently in speculation about the
spot are former Transporation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and
Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr.
   ``Literally, I haven't started thinking about names'' of
potential running mates, although ``it's thoroughly understandable
there's increased speculation,'' Bush said.
   The vice president declined to say whether he thought recent
polls, showing him trailing Democrat Michael Dukakis, were partly a
reflection of President Reagan's lagging popularity. ``I don't want
to lay off any problems I may have on somebody else,'' he said.
   Bush said he hoped to narrow the gap _ especially the ``gender
gap'' indicating he has far less support among women than among men.
   ``People are interested in the family. I've got a good one,''
Bush said. ``I don't think we get credit for how we manage family
values yet, and what really motivates me. And caring, and
compassion and all that stuff.''
   He said that Dukakis ``will come out of that Democratic
convention with a traditional liberal Democratic platform. We'll
come out with a sound, forward-looking Republican platform. That
will put the differences in focus.''
   In a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday, Bush also:
   _Indicated he would pursue the Reagan administration's fight for
continued military aid for anti-government Contra forces in
Nicaragua if elected, but with more of an effort to reach an
accommodation with Congress. ``I'd want to do it practically to
see, let's be sure what we do will pass,'' he said.
   The adminstration has repeatedly run into broad opposition in
Congress for its efforts to provide military assistance to the
Contras. ``I'd love to find a way to take a package to the Hill and
get it passed,'' Bush said.
   _Said, if elected, he would ``redouble whatever efforts we
have'' to press for the release of jailed South African black
leader Nelson Mandela and to get the Pretoria governent to
negotiate with opposition factions.
   However, he said he opposes the depiction by Democratic platform
writers of that white minority-ruled country as a ``terrorist
state'' and said he opposes Dukakis' call for tougher economic
sanctions. The ones now in place, he said, ``aren't working and are
hurting the people we're trying to help.''
   _Conceded that his efforts to paint Dukakis as an elitist
``Harvard liberal'' could backfire, saying: ``I wouldn't want to do
too much of that.'' However, he said he plans to mix campaign
rhetoric against Dukakis with facts and said: ``I've got to get
people's attention.''
   Bush was to address a national convention of the Junior Chambers
of Commerce today in Richmond.
   On Wednesday, he went to the Capitol to endorse a House
Republican plan to severely punish narcotics users _ including a
proposal for the death penalty for major drug dealers, which he had
previously supported _ and used the opportunity to accuse Democrats
of making a ``shrill political issue'' of anti-drug programs.
   He also joined former rival Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole at
the Agriculture Department for a briefing from Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng on this year's drought throughout much of
the nation.

   the Democrats' chance of victory in the fall.
   ``Mike Dukakis is going to carry our party to victory in
November. He is going to win in the East, in the North, in the
West, and he is going to win right here in the South.''
   Bush, in a speech to the United States Jaycees in Richmond, Va.,
called illegal drugs ``the ultimate fatal attraction'' and
reiterated his call for requiring companies with government
contracts to have drug-free programs.
   ``The point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just
a profit and loss issue; it's a matter of protecting the health and
safety of workers,'' he said.
   Jackson, testifying before a Senate committee, said
strengthening the Coast Guard and Customs border patrol should be
the first steps in stopping drugs coming into the United States.
   There have been calls for greater use of military forces, but
Jackson said, ``We must be careful, however, to avoid involving the
military in any police actions against citizens or arrests.''
   Meanwhile, Atlanta pollster Claibourne Darden Jr. said at a news
conference that his new survey found Bush supported by 45.1 percent
of prospective Southern voters compared to 42.3 percent for Dukakis
_ a difference falling within the 3.6 percent margin of potential
sampling error.
   Darden said the survey, conducted among 750 people in nine
states June 8-13, also showed Dukakis could help himself in the
South by choosing Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia or former Sen. John
Glenn of Ohio as a running mate, but that selecting Jackson ``would
be disastrous in the South.''
   Bush said in an interview with The Associated Press he was
sticking close to Washington due both to a shortage of campaign
travel funds and the lull that comes with the end of the primary
season. Bush has spent most of the money allowed under federal
limits for the preconvention phase of the campaign.
   ``You can get more attention for something you say in Washington
... so you have a different ability to get your message out and
still live within your budget,'' the vice president said.
   The South is critical to Dukakis if he is to rack up the 270
electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Dukakis was making
stops in Tennessee, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Texas and Alabama.
   The Massachusetts governor won the Florida and Texas primaries
on March 8. Gore carried Tennessee, while Jackson was the winner in
Alabama and South Carolina.
   Jackson's appearance today before the Senate Labor Committee on
drug education and abuse, an issue he has highlighted in this
year's campaign, was to be followed by a meeting with Sen. Ernest
Hollings of Jackson's home state of South Carolina.
   Jackson won the South Carolina caucuses, and Hollings said last
week he would vote for Jackson at the convention on the basis of
that. That's a view Jackson wants other ``super delegates'' to
take, too.
   Jackson has said he will seek the support of the unpledged
public and party officeholders who will attend the Democratic
National Convention as super delegates.
   With attention increasingly focusing on the convention, Jackson
said he is ready for a floor fight if he doesn't get his way on
taxing the wealthy and freezing military spending.
   Jackson also said he met Wednesday with Dukakis campaign
chairman Paul Brountas, who has been interviewing potential running
mates to join the Massachusetts governor on the Democratic
presidential ticket.
   But Jackson said at a news conference he has not yet decided
whether he would want the post, only that he has earned ``serious
consideration.''
   Bush on Wednesday went to the Capitol to endorse a House
Republican plan to severely punish narcotics users _ including a
proposal for the death penalty for major drug dealers, which he had
previously supported. He used the opportunity to accuse Democrats
of making a ``shrill political issue'' of anti-drug programs.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham said he had a
``clear conscience'' as he awaited a jury's verdict on criminal
charges that he concealed a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The jury deliberated for 3 hours and 45 minutes after receiving
the case Wednesday, then resumed work today.
   ``I'll feel better when it's here (the verdict),'' Mecham, 64,
told reporters as the jury was dismissed for the night. But he
added he expected to sleep well because ``I have a clear
conscience.''
   The former governor again insisted that he and his co-defendant,
his brother Willard, were innocent of any crime.
   But prosecutor Barnett Lotstein told the jury in Wednesday's
final portion of the closing arguments that the Mechams' ``cloak of
innocence has been stripped away thread by thread by thread;
Willard Mecham and Evan Mecham stand naked before you now ...
because the evidence is overwhelming of their guilt.''
   Mecham, a Republican, took office in January 1987 and was
removed April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of two
unrelated impeachment charges. He also was impeached in connection
with the loan, but the Senate decided not to hear that charge for
fear of prejudicing his criminal trial.
   The Mechams face felony charges of concealing the $350,000 loan
on financial disclosure reports required by the state. The loan
from developer Barry Wolfson did not appear on Mecham's personal or
campaign finance statements.
   Mecham's lawyer, Michael Scott, told reporters ``there was
absolutely no evidence of intent'' to conceal the loan.
   The defense said the loan was properly reported as part of a
$465,000 lump sum that was listed as a campaign contribution from
Evan Mecham, and that the failure to itemize the loan was an
innocent mistake by his brother, Willard Mecham, who was his
campaign treasurer.
   Lotstein disputed a defense claim that the loan was common
knowledge because one former top Mecham aide said she knew about it.
   ``To claim that the loan was not a secret from the public
because some insiders knew about it would be like claiming that the
secret plan for the Normandy invasion in World War II was public
knowledge because the general that planned it knew about it,'' the
prosecutor said.
   Lotstein contended that Mecham lied when he told reporters Oct.
30 that he did not owe any loan to Wolfson, but that his campaign
did, and that he did not intend to repay it. Wolfson testified that
Mecham called him shortly afterward, assured Wolfson he would be
repaid, and said his attorney had told him to make the public
statement.
   The defense said Mecham had no motive to hide the loan because
the report on which it appeared was not filed until a month after
the Nov. 4, 1986, election.
   But Lotstein said a disclosure of the loan early in Mecham's new
administration would have destroyed his image of being anti-special
interest.
   Mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents and faced from almost nine
to 22 years in prison if convicted of all charges.
   Willard Mecham faced three similar counts and up to 9{ years in
prison if convicted of all charges.

   diet high in vitamin-deficient white rice, a researcher suggested
Thursday.
   Ronald Munger, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of
Minnesota's division of epidemiology, said his studies show that
stress is not the leading cause of Sudden Unexpected Death
Syndrome, as some experts have said.
   Munger, 34, presented his findings Thursday to a conference of
the Society for Epidemiologic Research in Vancouver, Br humans and monkeys
both
received the virus from a common ancestor. Monkeys and humans are
descendants of primates who lived 20 million to 30 million years
ago.
   The report on African green monkeys by Hayami's team was
published in Nature, a British scientific journal, earlier this
month. Carel Mulder, a University of Massachusetts biologist, in a
separate commentary in Nature, said the findings mean ``the human
viruses cannot have originated from African monkeys in recent
times, as had been predicted by many people.''
   Hayami says many diseases that afflict humans came from animals,
so it was not unreasonable to theorize that AIDS did as well.
   His complete genetic sequencing of the green monkey virus
determined that the simian and human viruses were different. The
sequencing involved checking by hand 9,000 base pairs of nucleic
acids _ the building blocks of genes.
   His laboratory has not completed sequencing of the mandrill
virus yet, but hybridization, another test, shows it is different
from human viruses and the African green monkey virus, Hayami said.
   ``SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) mandrill is really we
think an authentic mandrill virus, not from another species,''
Hayami said.
   The most intriguing aspect of the two simian viruses is that
neither produces illness in the animals that host them. Examining
why the simian virus does not produce illness could lead ``to a
strategy for producing a vaccine'' to prevent AIDS in humans,
Hayami said.
   Because the African green monkey virus has been fully
genetically analyzed, it can be compared with the human virus.
Hayami's laboratory has found that the human virus has an ``R''
gene, which is missing in the simian virus.
   He said his laboratory staff has already begun ``constructing a
recombinant clone of the African green monkey cirus with an `R'
gene. We are going to test it to try to induce AIDS.''
   Hayami said, ``At this moment, nobody knows the function of this
gene. If we prove the `R' gene is responsible for pathogenicity
that is very important. We can have the weapon to attack the human
virus. But that is only my dream.''
   Meanwhile, work is continuing on the full genetic sequencing of
the mandrill virus.
   The virus was found in two mandrills living in the primate
center's forested enclosure. Both were born in the wild and
captured and brought to the Franceville center, a $30 million
facility built with Gabon's oil earnings to study infertility. In
recent years in it has focused on AIDS research.
   In April, other scientists at the center claimed to have found
two chimpanzees with an AIDS virus. If confirmed, it will be the
first time chimpanzees have been found with the disease.
   As chimpanzees are a closer relative of humans than monkeys,
this could be another important step for AIDs research.

   Wilting crops and worried farmers are giving
this summer a place in the history books, along with most of 1980s,
as a dry era in America.
   Drought has plagued one part of the nation or another in every
summer this decade except 1982, and the cumulative effect may well
pose the most serious danger.
   For even if the weather breaks and rain reaches farmers, areas
like the Tennessee Valley and Pacific Northwest have dry subsoils
that won't recharge instantly.
   Indeed, the Tennessee Valley has missed what amounts to a year's
rainfall in the last four, and the Southeast in general is short a
year's rain in this decade, according to government weather records.
   Even so, things aren't yet as bad as the dreary Dust Bowl years
of the 1930s.
   That was a time when five or six dry years threatened to
depopulate some areas where the soil blew away with the winds.
   Now the Tennessee Valley could move into that class, after four
dry years that included a 100-year record for drought in 1986,
warns A. James Wagner of the federal Climate Analysis Center.
   That region ``is down about 40 inches of rain over four years,''
Wagner said. ``They have had only 75 percent of normal rain in the
last four years.''
   Montana and North Dakota also have suffered for several years,
he added, and this summer other areas are being affected too.
   This year's drought ``doesn't really fit exactly into a pattern
like we've seen before. The dust bowl was worse in the Plains,
while the driest areas are east of the Plains this year,'' Wagner
said.
   But this sere summer comes late in a dry decade.
   In 1980, dryness records were set in states from Texas to
Virginia. In 1984, Montana and the Dakotas received less than half
their normal precipitation. In 1986 and 1987, the Southeast was hit
hard.
   And hot weather has accompanied the parching.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported
that 1986 and 1987 were the warmest years, on average, in more than
three decades and among the warmest on record.
   That has raised alarm among environmentalists worrying about the
greenhouse effect _ the trapping of heat from the sun by carbon
dioxide and other gases. Experts fear this ultimately will raise
the world's temperature.
   Much of the Southeast is 12 percent below normal in rainfall in
this decade _ the equivalent of a year without rain. Some parts of
Georgia are 70 inches or more below normal.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said this week that a wet
July could save the situation but without that, the drought ``could
well be a catastrophe.''
   Wheat fields in Montana and the Dakotas already have been
damaged, Lyng said, and additional weeks of scorching temperatures
and no rain could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt and across
the South.
   The immediate cause of the drought, Wagner said, is an
abnormally strong ridge of high pressure, ``which tends to suppress
the mechanisms in the atmosphere which cause precipitation, and
tends to steer the storm systems elsewhere.''
   In general, weather patterns change more slowly in summer than
at other times of year, meteorologists note. So, once a high
pressure area is moved into an area by the upper-air weather
patterns, it may be difficult to dislodge.
   The Midwest drought has been caused by a strong high pressure
area in the northern United States and southern Canada over the
last two months, so storms go west or north of the high, or move
south to the Gulf Coast, Wagner said.
   That same pattern has directed the storms away from the
Southeast and Tennessee Valley, he said.
   Texas and the southern plains were dry this spring, but the
forecast calls for relief for both during the next 30 days, Wagner
said. In the western part of the Rio Grande area, at least, and in
the southern plains and Rockies, it looks wet for the summer as a
whole, he said.
   In the Southeast, he said, ``We are not predicting particularly
dry weather for the next 30 days, but we did have an indication the
area could have a dry summer. So the next couple weeks may have a
few showers, but it could dry out later.''
   That same pattern, he said, is ``causing us to predict a
relative chance of above normal rainfall for the Great Lakes for
the summer.''
   ``A ridge of high pressure is predicted to move somewhat farther
south as summer goes on, and the Southeast will dry out and the
Upper Midwest or Great Lakes could end up with normal or above
normal rain by summer's end.
   ``But that may not be in time to help the crops,'' he said.
   In the Northwest, there was severe drought last fall and it's
been wet in the last month, Wagner noted. But, he added, ``that's
deceptive because they get most the rain in fall and winter, so
they are down several inches too. ... The subsoil is dry although
the top may be moist.''
   In California, for the most part, the indication is for a near
normal summer, although it looks dry during the next 30 days in the
areas around Los Angeles, Bakersfield and Fresno, Wagner said.

   A pygmy killer whale beached itself
and died at the Isle of Palms of wounds it apparently suffered from
sharks, authorities say.
   The 7-foot-long whale, a type rarely seen, was spotted
Wednesday. It beached itself twice but was helped back into the
water by swimmers, then pulled back ashore because police feared it
would attract sharks to the crowded beach, said police Cpl. Les
Griffin.
   The whale died before a veterinarian arrived, officials said.
   The dead whale was examined by Al Sanders, curator of natural
science at the Charleston Museum, and Andrew Mount, a research
analyst with the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium.
   It was the only second stranding of a pygmy killer whale on
record in the state, with the first two years ago, Sanders said.
   The wounds on the whale's back were probably caused by sharks,
he said.

<TEXT>
   This has been a dry decade _ except for 1982 _
in much of America. Here's the rundown:
   1980:
   Hot and dry summer weather developed in a pattern similar to the
unpleasant summers of 1952-54. Rainfall was between 25 percent and
50 percent of normal across much of the nation. The heat wave was
blamed for as many as 1,200 deaths and crop and livestock damage
estimated at $20 billion.
   Record dryness in various months were reported in parts of
Texas, Kansas, Wyoming, Arkansas and Virginia as the hot, dry
weather extended from the Missouri Valley throughout the
Southeastern states.
   1981:
   Much of the nation remained in the grip of the drought which
began in 1980. Light winter snowfall meant that groundwater was not
recharged and municipal water supplies in the Northeast slipped to
dangerously low levels.
   Rains starting in May brought relief to some farm areas,
although abnormally dry weather remained the rule in the northern
Great Plains, Southeast and Middle Atlantic states.
   1982:
   Things were better this year with no extensive areas of drought
in the nation as cool Canadian air helped produce active rain
fronts during most of the summer.
   1983:
   Searing heat struck in July and August, producing severe drought
east of the Rockies.
   The drought was similar to that of 1980 but centered slightly
farther north, in the western corn belt states. Corn and soybean
crops were severely damaged and the dryness extended to the
Mid-Atlantic region. Rain was less than one-quarter of normal in
parts of Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and
Illinois.
   1984:
   Wheat crops were damaged to the tune of more than $1 billion in
Montana and North Dakota when rainfall totaled only one-third of
normal in the first half of the year. Many brush fires were
reported. Persistent dryness also damaged crops and gassslands in
central Texas.
   1985:
   Dry conditions led to serious brush and forest fires in
California and in the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains states.
   1986:
   The Southeast sweltered under dry conditions that had begun the
previous autumn. Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and
Tennessee were affected by a drought that has been described as the
worst in more than a century, less than one-quarter the normal rain
falling in some areas.
   Some relief came in August when rains helped soybean crops, but
it was too late for hay and corn. Regional damage estimates topped
$1 billion.
   1987:
   Forest fires scorched more than two million acres when a dry
winter was followed by a sweltering summer in parts of Idaho,
Washington, Oregon and California. Water shortages occurred in
Spokane and some other communities.
   Hot, dry conditions in July and August also contributed to
drought conditions in the Southeast, reducing crop yields sharply.
Heavy rains came along in September, but excessively dry conditions
returned to the Southeast in October and November, particularly
affecting West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.

<HEAD>Drought Brings India Back To World Food Markets</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a decade after India succeeded
in growing enough food to feed itself, drought has forced the
world's second most populous nation back to the international food
markets.
   The purchases have been small _ a million metric tons of wheat
from the United States and 500,000 metric tons of rice from
Thailand _ and are solely to replenish buffer stocks. But they
underscore the limits of India's ``green revolution'' of the early
1970s and how reliant on the weather it remains.
   India's ability to feed itself also is linked to curbing a
population that has reached 800 million and is growing at a rate of
2.2 percent a year.
   The food problems began last summer when the monsoon failed and
a drought moved north into prime farming regions, leading to a
winter rice harvest about 10 million tons less than that of the
previous year.
   When the rains did come, another wheat crop was in the fields.
That harvest was slightly larger than that of the year before,
``but they needed a fantastic crop to make up for the kharif
(winter rice) failure,'' said a Western diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The government has used its food reserves to make up for the
shortfall. Reserves have shrunk from 25 million metric tons in July
1987 to about 9.43 million tons, news and other reports said. A
metric ton weighs 2,205 pounds and is equivalent to about 1.1 short
tons.
   ``India handled the drought well,'' said the diplomat, an
agricultural specialist. ``We've had no reports of deaths.''
   The government's problem is getting enough of the wheat now
being harvested.
   Farmers, private traders and flour millers have been working to
keep the wheat crop off the market to take advantage of the
shrinking national reserves and drive up prices. The United News of
India recently quoted Sukh Ram, minister of state for food and
supply, as warning middlemen about hoarding.
   Hope is focused on the life-bestowing monsoon due to hit New
Delhi in late June. Western officials expect India to buy more
wheat and rice this year, and the strength of the monsoon will
determine how much must be purchased.
   Problems remain even if the weather cooperates and India's grain
production continues its modest increase.
   The green revolution extended only to wheat and rice, and
production lags in other areas, according to Agriculture Secretary
C. Asrinivasa Sastry.
   India bought 100,000 metric tons of corn from Argentina this
year and was given 100,000 tons by the United States. Corn imports
could total 500,000 tons by the end of the year, the Western
diplomat said.
   India also remains the world's largest importer of edible oils _
120,000 tons this year _ and also imports soybeans, lentils, butter
oil, non-fat dry milk and small amounts of sugar and cotton.
   Western officials have criticized India's agriculture extension
service, saying it is not getting necessary information to the
farmers.
   But Sastry said it takes time to disseminate information.
   About 85 percent of India's wheat-growing land is now irrigated,
but the diplomat believes more must be done.
   Sastry said his ministry is working to increase irrigation,
improve dry land farming and increase production in states where
water is no problem.
   India's initial green revolution allowed it to grow as much food
as the people could buy, but 200 million people _ 25 percent of the
population _ don't have the money to buy enough food and are
malnourished.
   Sastry said increases in rice and wheat production have leveled
off in recent years but said he was not worried about population
growth outstripping the country's ability to feed itself.
   ``But if you want to make a significant step up in production
... There will have to be another green revolution,'' he said.

   Democrat Jesse Jackson today urged the
government to use caution in involving the military in its war on
drugs and said that option should be used primarily as a backup.
   Jackson testified before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources about prevention and treatment of drug abuse, and in the
session senators lavished him with praise for his outspoken
leadership on the subject.
   In answer to a question from Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, about
current sentiment in some quarters for legalization of drugs,
Jackson replied, ``That would be a mistake. It would be surrender
to the No. 1 threat to our national security. We would not think of
legalization of smog because there's a lot of it. It's dangerous.''
   Jackson, commenting on the current effort to use the military in
drug interdiction, said, ``We must be careful, however, to avoid
involving the military in any police actions against citizens or
arrests.''
   He said strengthening the Coast Guard and Customs border patrol
should be the first priority in interdiction.
   ``We should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any
other aspect of foreign policy. But the military can play a greater
and useful role in backing up these efforts and providing
intelligence assistance,'' he said.
   Before the hearing, Jackson jokingly pinned a large ``Jackson
88'' badge on Hatch's lapel. Hatch, one of the conservative
movement's guiding lights, wore the button through the hearing, but
joked that ``I thought you were worried sick about the effect it
would have on you'' to have such a conservative wearing the badge.
   Jackson later met with Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the only
senator who has said he will give Jackson his delegate vote at the
convention.
   Hollings said he supports Jackson because he won South Carolina
and he said more Democrats should follow his example ``for the good
of the party.'' Hollings also said Jackson had changed since 1984,
when both of them ran for president.
   ``I would think Jesse frightened the bejesus out of them four
years ago. I remember him standing up and saying his time has come!
`I want it all,''' Hollings said.
   ``This time he's run a winning campaign. He hasn't frightened
anyone. He's charmed them in all of those different debates and in
his own right has leveled off.''
   On Wednesday, Jackson said he met with Dukakis campaign chairman
Paul Brountas, who has been interviewing potential running mates to
join the Massachusetts governor on the Democratic presidential
ticket.
   But Jackson told a news conference he has not yet decided
whether he would want the post, only that he has earned ``serious
consideration.''
   He made the comments after a meeting with the Congressional
Black Caucus, whose members urged him to seek the post and said
they will try to meet with Dukakis and lobby him to choose Jackson.
   Jackson would not discuss his meeting with Brountas but said it
was ``a very meaningful preliminary discussion.''
   In a Wednesday evening interview on Cable News Network, Jackson
elaborated: ``We simply discussed today the process, discussed the
guidelines, we talked about the requirements. After all, we need to
know what the rules are, what the standards will be.''
   He said he is talking to Dukakis not only about the vice
presidency, but about his budget concerns and his proposal to pay
for social spending by freezing military spending and hiking taxes
on the rich and corporations.
   He said earlier in the day that his budget priorities are his
``most critical'' concern now that Dukakis and he agree on South
Africa policy.
   ``The most critical becomes this budget, a commitment to invest
in people, a commitment to reinvest in America,'' Jackson said
following a meeting with leaders of civil rights groups.
   He said he is prepared to go to the convention floor if Dukakis
balks.
   ``Of course, that's the proper mechanism and it's the thing to
do,'' he told CNN when asked if he might wage a floor fight.
   Asked what would happen if he loses the fight, Jackson took a
philosophical approach: ``Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
... If you lose you will at least have left your imprint.''
   On the vice presidency issue, Dukakis has said previously that
Jackson will be considered, but not that he will get any special
consideration by being runner up.
   Jackson made clear he would like the offer to be made to him
although he has declined to say that in so many words publicly,
instead stating that it is Dukakis' option.

<HEAD>Birth Control Pills Linked To Increased AIDS Risk In Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prostitutes in Africa who use birth
control pills are two to three times as likely as other prostitutes
to become infected with AIDS, researchers said Thursday.
   They said it is not known why birth control pills should
increase a woman's risk of getting AIDS, but the pills can prouce a
condition that might serve as an entry point for the virus into the
bloodstream.
   The risk of getting AIDS through heterosexual contact also
increases in people with such diseases as herpes, syphilis and
chancroid, all of which produce genital ulcers or lesions, said Dr.
King Holmes of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Wash.
   Control of these and other genital ulcer diseases ``should be
the highest priority for controlling heterosexual AIDS
transmission,'' Holmes said at the Fourth International Conference
on AIDS.
   In separate reports, researchers said they found no evidence of
mental problems in people who are infected with AIDS but have not
developed other signs of the disease.
   Earlier studies had suggested mental faculties might decline
soon after infection with the AIDS virus, and the suggestion was
made that infected people who were otherwise healthy should be
removed from sensitive jobs. The new research suggests no basis for
such action, researchers said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal disease for which
no cure has been found, is caused by a virus that damages the
body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and
cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Holmes, a specialist in sexually transmitted diseases, cited
figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control showing the
number of reported AIDS cases acquired through heterosexual contact
had increased from about 1 percent of the total cases in 1983 to
almost 4 percent now.
   Among men, the percentage has increased seven to nine times,
from one-tenth of one percent to between seven-tenths and
nine-tenths of one percent, he said.
   In women, the percentage of heterosexually acquired cases is
much higher. About 20 percent to 30 percent of AIDS cases in women
in the United States were probably acquired through heterosexual
contact, he said.
   The problem is especially severe among minorities in the inner
cities, the areas where prostitution and intravenous drug abuse are
concentrated, Holmes said. ``Programs for prevention of
heterosexual transmission of HIV via sex with prostitutes are
urgently needed in all countries,'' he said.
   Holmes recommended starting the programs in early adolescence
because, ``If you wait until 18 to give the lecture on AIDS, it's
too late.''
   The association of genital ulcer disease and birth control pills
with AIDS comes from studies by Francis Plummer and others in
Nairobi, Kenya, Holmes told the conference.
   He said the pills can produce a condition called cervical ectopy
in which part of the cervical lining is exposed to the vagina, and
the explosed lining might be an entry point for the AIDS virus into
the bloodstream.
   Genital ulcer disease presumably increases the AIDS risk by
allowing the virus to enter the body through the ulcers, he said.
   In the United States, the leading causes of genital ulcer
disease are herpes, syphilis and chancroid in that order, but in
Africa the bacterial infection chancroid is first.
   Holmes also noted that the sexually transmitted disease called
chlamydia also may increase the risk of contracting AIDS. As a
consequence, he said, controlling sexually transmitted disease is
crucial in the fight against AIDS.
   ``AIDS prevention without sexually transmitted-disease control
in a meaningful way is a blueprint for disaster,'' he said.
   The study of the effects of AIDS infection on the brain involved
observation and examination of 201 people for two years, slightly
more than half of whom were infected with the AIDS virus. They were
examined every six months.
   ``We're not seeing any difference whatsoever in terms of a
number of psychological measures known to be sensitive to virtually
any form of brain damage,'' said one of the authors, Dr. Ola
Selnes, a psychologist at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in
Baltimore.
   The study by Selnes and Dr. Justin McArthur, also of Johns
Hopkins, found no basis for the concern that had been expressed
about people in sensitive jobs, Selnes said.
   ``Based on our results, we do not feel there is any cause for
alarm or concern,'' Selnes said. The study was sponsored by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   Researchers generally agree that mental problems do appear late
in the progression of AIDS. Autopsies have shown about 70 percent
of those who die of AIDS have significant mental and neurological
problems after other symptoms develop, said a report released in
March by the World Health Organization.

   Hundreds of Dutch students hurled

protest against a government plan to cut their education grants,
police said.
   Three people were arrested and one window in Parliament was
smashed before riot police dispersed more than 1,000 demonstrators,
said police spokesman Guus Auerbach. He denied a news report that
police had charged the protesers.
   It was the latest in a series of demonstrations against plans by

   The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles today
blocked the execution of Freddie Davis six hours before he was to
die in the electric chair for raping and stabbing to death a woman
in 1977.
   The five-member board suspended the execution for up to 90 days
to decide whether Davis' life should be spared.
   Although the board could lift the suspension at any time, board
chairman Wayne Snow said he expected it would take at least that
long to make a decision.
   Davis, 30, would have been the second murderer put to death in
the nation in two days and the 101st since resumption of capital
punishment in 1977.
   The board, which conducted a hearing Wednesday, is the only
non-judicial state entity with the authority to commute a death
sentence.
   Davis' execution order expires at noon Tuesday. If the
suspension remains in effect beyond then, the state will have to
seek a new execution order.
   Snow said the decision was prompted by questions over Davis'
role in the killing, a new trial granted an alleged accomplice and
the accomplice's recantation of incriminating testimony.
   Earlier today, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied
without comment a request for a stay, and attorneys appealed to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   The execution was scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Georgia Diagnostic
and Classification Center near Jackson.
   Davis was sentenced to death for the 1977 rape and stabbing of
Frances Rice Coe, whose neighbor Eddie Spraggins also was convicted
and sentenced to death in the case. Davis was 19 at the time of the
slaying.
   Spraggins, who was the prime witness against Davis, won a new
trial after his lawyers argued that the judge failed to properly
inform the jury that his I.Q. was 65.
   Spraggins has recanted his 1977 testimony against Davis. In an
affidavit filed with the Georgia Supreme Court he said: ``When I
testified at Freddie Davis' trial that Freddie Davis was in the
room with Mrs. Coe when Mrs. Coe was killed, this was false and
untrue.''
   On Tuesday, Edward R. Byrne Jr., 28, was executed in Louisiana
for killing a service station cashier he had romanced as part of a
plot to rob her in 1984.

<HEAD>Senators Hit Administration Plan To Sell Advanced Weapons to
Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several senators Thursday attacked a proposed
$1.9 billion U.S. weapons sale to Kuwait that includes advanced
fighter planes and an array of bombs and air-to-ground missiles.
   It is ``inconceivable'' that the administration would
contemplate such a large sale to a country which is so small and
has been on less than friendly terms with the United States until
recently, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., told Secretary of State
George P. Shultz at a Senate hearing.
   DeConcini also said he feared that the sale would make some of
the most advanced weapons in the U.S. arsenal accessible to the
Soviet Union.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said he was concerned that the
F-A-18 fighter-bomber, the most sophisticated plane of its type in
the U.S. arsenal, could be outfitted with larger fuel tanks that
could render it capable of attacking Israel.
   Concern also was expressed by Sens. Bob Kasten, R-Wis., and
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., at the hearing of the Approprations
subcommittee on foreign operations.
   Shultz defended the proposed sale, saying it represented ``a
political breakthrough'' for the Kuwaitis to tie themselves to
American technology and to take responsibility for their own
defense. He said Kuwait is vulnerable to attack from Iran, and that
the weapons would not have the range to reach Israel.
   And he said the sale agreement would have adequate controls to
prevent access to the weapons by the Soviets.
   ``In our judgment, this is a positive development,'' Shultz
said. ``The mission is if there is an attack by ground or sea from
Iran, they can do something to counter that.''
   He said some of the alternative aircraft that had been
considered by Kuwait to replace its aging fleet would have had a
longer range sufficient to reach Israel.
   The administration has notified Congress informally that it
intends to make the sale, including 40 F-A-18 fighters, 40 harpoon
missiles, 120 heat-seeking Sidewinder and 200 radar-guided Sparrow
air-to-air missiles, 300 air-to-ground Mavericks, 200 cluster bombs
and 400 laser-guided bombs.
   Following a 20-day informal notification period, the
administration will submit a formal notification to Congress of the
sale and lawmakers will have 30 days to pass a joint resolution
disapproving the transaction.
   If the sale goes through, it would be the first time F-A-18s are
sold to a country outside a formal U.S. alliance. So far only
Australia, Canada and Spain _ all formal U.S. allies _ have been
permitted to buy the plane.
   The administration was forced to drop Mavericks from a weapons
sale to Saudi Arabia last October, and DeConcini asked Shultz if
the same might be done in the Kuwaiti sale.
   Shultz responded that the Maverick is ``especially effective''
and was included in the sale to make the aircraft functional. He
said the Kuwaiti sale was not comparable to the Saudi sale because
the Saudis already had Mavericks, and were seeking additional ones.
Kuwait currently has none, he said.

   Klaus Juenschke, a former left-wing
terrorist sentenced to life in prison for robbing a bank and
killing a police officer, was pardoned Thursday after serving 16
years in prison.
   Juenschke, 40, a former member of the Red Army Faction, has
renounced terrorism in several interviews with the West German news
media.
   He was pardoned by Rheinland Pfalz governor Bernhard Vogel.
   Vogel said he pardoned Juenschke because he had changed in
views, behaved well in prison and had already spent many years
behind bars.
   Juenschke was convicted of robbing a bank in Kaiserslautern and
killing a police officer who tried to stop the Dec. 22, 1971 crime.
   The Red Army Faction, which grew from the radical students'
movement of the 1960s, claimed responsibility for killings and
attacks on U.S. military installations. The group has been inactive
in recent years, but smaller offshoots continue to operate in West
Germany.

   President Reagan told a group of honored high
school seniors Thursday that they and their Soviet counterparts
must ``bring peoples of other cultures together'' in a comman bond
of humanity.
   Reagan, addressing the winners of the Presidential Scholars
Medallion, advised the students to ``stand forthrightly for the
values of our whole way of life and what it is based upon.''
   The president, who noted that he had spoken to students from
Moscow University during the recent U.S.-Soviet summit, said it was
vital that Americans learn ``the importance of the values implicit
in civilization and the need to teach and transmit from generation
to generation a moral education.'''
   ``Loyalty, faithfulness, commitment, courage, patriotism, the
ability to distinguish between right and wrong _ I hope that these
values are as much a part of your life as any calculus course or
social science study,'' Reagan told the students.
   The president said he found few differences between the young

in the Rose Garden, and that ``it's just our governments that are
based on different principles.''
   ``And that's the job before you and those students in Moscow for
the remainder of this century and into the next one,'' Reagan said.
``To bring peoples of other cultures together in that common bond
of humanity.''
   He added that American students must also learn ``to speak for
freedom; to argue for democracy; and always to bear in mind those
fundamental, moral distinctions between systems of government that
believe in the dignity of the individual and others systems that
simply see the individual as a cog in the great machine of the
state.''
   The presidential scholars program was established in 1964. This
year, some 139 students were chosen _ 121 on the basis of academic
achievements, leadership qualities and community involvement. The
other 18 were recognized for superior accomplishments in the arts
as well as academic performance, the White House said.

   The son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro was sentenced today to four months in
jail for selling $25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police
officer two years ago.
   John Zaccaro Jr., 24, and his parents stood stoically as Judge
Francis McCaffrey handed down the sentence in Vermont District
Court in Rutland.
   ``I can't in good conscience sentence you without any time to
serve,'' McCaffrey said. The sentence also includes 300 hours of
community service and a $1,500 fine.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' Ferraro said, noting that other defendants in Vermont
drug cases have received lighter penalties.
   ``We'll continue on our way with an appeal. We love our son,''
she said.
   A tearful Ferraro had asked McCaffrey not to treat her son
differently than any other person convicted of selling a quarter of
a gram of cocaine.
   Ferraro, who ran on the Democratic ticket in 1984, said her
son's arrest and conviction has taken a heavy toll on her family
and her son.
   ``He doesn't go to church with us,'' she said in Vermont
District Court. ``He doesn't want to be seen with us. It's not
because he's ashamed of us. It's because he's ashamed of what he's
done.''
   Zaccaro told McCaffrey in a quivering voice that he has sworn
off drugs.
   ``I'd like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that I
will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality,'' he told
McCaffrey.
   McCaffrey suggested that the jail time be served through the
Chittenden Community Correctional Center in Burlington so that
Zaccaro could participate in a special corrections program that
allows him to be kept under house arrest.
   However, Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said later
that Zaccaro would have to be accepted into the program.
   Zaccaro is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the sentence.
   Zaccaro faced up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   His attorney, Charles Tetzlaff, had asked McCaffrey to accept a
probation officer's recommendation of a suspended sentence,
probation and community service of unspecified length.
   Quinn recommended a jail term, citing the deterrent effect on
drug cases in society. He did not specify the length, but said
afterward he was pleased with the sentence.
   He denied that he had treated the case differently.
   ``This was a case in which we caught someone red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' Quinn said. ``I felt that it was important for
the court to say it doesn't matter who you are. If you commit a
drug offense in the state of Vermont, you'll be treated with great
severity.''
   Also at the sentencing hearing, the founder of Covenant House, a
New York City shelter for runaways, said he believes that Zaccaro
has learned from his mistakes and should not be imprisoned.
   Zaccaro has worked as a volunteer for the shelter in a program
that brings runaways, child prostitutes and other children from the
streets to the center.
   ``You can't try and reach these kids ... without coming into a
far better and deeper understanding of your own value system,''
said the Rev. Bruce Ritter. ``Probably the most important things we
learn are from our mistakes. John has learned them.''
   Quinn said earlier that he wants the sentence to be noticed to
deter other drug sellers and users.
   ``If you want to get a message out to people, you certainly want
to send that in a high-profile case,'' the prosecutor said. ``We
need to educate people about the horrors of drugs and if that
doesn't work, at least scare them away because of the possibility
of legal sanction.''
   At the hearing, Quinn asked Ritter what message the sentence
should send regarding drug use.
   ``I doubt that incarceration of John would be much of a
deterrent to anyone,'' Ritter replied. ``Incarceration for John
right now would be more in line of society seeking retribution
rather than deterrence.''
   Also testifying this morning was former Middlebury police Sgt.
David Wemette, who said that while investigating the case he found
highly sophisticated scales on Zaccaro's desk.
   ``He needs no more punishment,'' Ferraro said of her son in a
letter written to McCaffrey. ``He has been publicly `flogged' on
national and international TV.''
   ``He will never touch drugs again and maybe someday I'll even
say it was a blessing in disguise,'' Ferraro wrote. ``Right now, it
still hurts too much to do so.''
   Zaccaro has grown into ``a mature, much quieter, much more
self-conscious adult'' since his arrest, Ferraro wrote.
   The letter is among 30 that McCaffrey has received before
sentencing Zaccaro. The contents of the letters are a part of the
court record. Ferraro's 1984 running mate, Walter Mondale, also put
in a good word for Zaccaro, said court clerk Ann Dingler.
   ``I saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good
friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and
strong way around our nation,'' said Mondale.
   Zaccaro was convicted by a jury in April in Vermont District
Court in Rutland. He was arrested in February 1986 after selling
$25 worth of cocaine to undercover agent Laura Manning while he was
attending Middlebury College.
   Manning testified that she went to Zaccaro's off-campus home and
inquired about buying cocaine. She said Zaccaro produced a tray of
cocaine packets from underneath the living room sofa. Zaccaro was
arrested that night outside the restaurant where he worked.
   Tetzlaff claimed Zaccaro had been entrapped, saying police had
used Manning as bait to snare him during a college party weekend.
The prosecution denied the charge.
   Quinn had filed a motion asking that he be allowed to introduce
at the hearing photographs of evidence seized from Zaccaro's car.
Police said the evidence included $1,600 in cash, 8 grams of
cocaine and records of drug transactions.
   The evidence was excluded two years ago when McCaffrey ruled
police had insufficient evidence when they obtained the warrant to
search Zaccaro's car.
   On Wednesday, a judge denied Quinn's motion, setting the stage
for today's sentencing.
   Zaccaro wrote about his work at Covenant House in the March
issue of Women's Day magazine, describing at length the experiences
of children on the streets and his decision to volunteer.
   ``When I told my parents, they were pleased. When I told my
lawyers, they were not. They knew it meant my dealing with drug
users. It would not be good for my image. I laughed,'' he wrote.
``There were kids who needed help. ... I've been lucky. These kids
never had a fair chance.''

   The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that an
Israeli couple must return the Brazilian girl they adopted to her
biological parents, who claim the child was kidnapped from their
home in Brazil.
   The court said the 2-year-old girl must be sent back to Brazil
by July 15, and it appointed a psychologist to help the child made
the transition.
   ``I'm very happy with the decision,'' the biological mother,
Rosilda Gonzalez, told Israel radio. She said she felt sorry for
the adoptive parents, but ``their suffering isn't half of what I
went through during this time.''
   Mrs. Gonzalez claims her daughter, Bruna, was kidnapped from her
home in Curitiba, Brazil in November 1986, then sold to the Israeli
couple.
   The couple adopted the child in good faith, their attorney,
Gershon Schneider, said. He said the couple was given adoption
papers with the signature of Mrs. Gonzalez. The signature turned
out to be forged.

   Elder statesman Abba Eban said Thursday the
Labor Party made a mistake when it pushed him off its slate for the
November elections to make room for political newcomers deemed more
attractive to voters.
   Eban, 73, fell victim a new selection system in which for the
first time the rank-and-file, not party bosses, chose the slate for
the elections to Israel's parliament, the Knesset.
   Half the candidates elected Wednesday were political newcomers,
and Labor's general secretary, Uzi Baram, called the outcome a
``revolution'' and ``feast for Israel's democracy.''
   ``It's clearly a disappointment,'' Eban told Israel army radio.
``During the years I have accumulated valuable knowledge and
experience. I told party members I'm ready to offer this, but if
you don't want it, I won't.''
   During his 40-year political career, Eban served as deputy prime
minister, foreign minister and Israel's ambassador to the United
States and the United Nations.
   Samuel Lewis, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said Eban's
ouster was a ``real tragedy, not for him, but for the country.''
   ``I've never known anyone else who I thought had made a greater
contribution to his country,'' Lewis told Israel radio from
Washington.
   Political analyst Yitzhak Galnoor said Eban might have retained
his position had the party bosses formed the slate, but the new
selection process showed he ``doesn't have a following in Israel.''
   ``Eban is not connected to any influential groups. He's just a
bright guy with a terrific sense of humor. Unfortunately, these
things are not very admired in Israeli politics,'' said Galnoor, a
political scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
   Party members did not choose Eban in the Labor Party's ranked
list of candidates for Israel's 120-member Knesset. The number of
parliament seats assigned to a party depends on its total vote in
the elections.
   Based on previous election results, Labor candidates in the top
40 to 45 slots are expected to be re-elected.
   Eleven slots, including the top seven reserved for party
leaders, were filled by appointment, not popular vote. Twenty-one
of the remaining 34 slots considered ``safe'' were given to
newcomers.
   Four of the newcomers were Sephardic Jews from North African
nations, a group that has traditionally voted for Labor's political
rival, the right-wing Likud bloc.
   Galnoor said the selection might improve Labor's chances in the
election, but also said such gains could be offset if Labor doesn't
deliver a clear message on how it will solve the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   Polls have indicated that the Labor Party might lose the
election to Likud because many voters have moved to the right in
response to the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Likud leaders say Israel will never withdraw from the occupied
territories. Labor advocates the return of some land in exchange
for peace, but opposes formation of a Palestinian state or the
dismantling of Jewish settlements.

   Hundreds of thousands of
blacks stayed away from work today to commemorate the 1976 Soweto
riots. An explosion killed one man, firebombs wounded three others
and a commuter railway was bombed.
   Police reported the deaths of 11 suspected African National
Congress guerrillas in the past week, including the man killed
today by explosives he was carrying near Cape Town. The man was not
identified.
   Another suspected guerrilla died in an accidental blast Tuesday,
and nine were killed by police in two shootouts near the Swaziland
border in the past week, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said police were
tipped off that Mozambique-based guerrillas would try to enter
South Africa via Swaziland to stage ``massive acts of terrorism.''
In each case, it said, police stopped vehicles at roadblocks and
riddled them with bullets after someone inside opened fire.
   Many factories shut down, and the largest daily newspaper for
blacks, The Sowetan, did not publish. Workers at three diamond
mines went on strike to demand that June 16 be designated a paid
holiday.
   The unrest came on the 12th anniversary of a police attack on
marching schoolchildren in the black township of Soweto. Ten
people, including two children, died that June 16. The
confrontation prompted a nationwide rampage in which hundreds were
killed.
   Commemorative church services were held in many black townships.
Security forces reportedly fired tear gas and bird shot because of
stone-throwing that occurred as blacks left a church service in
Lamontville, outside Durban.
   At Langa, a black township outside Cape Town, a commuter rail
line was bombed at midday. Police headquarters said two officers on
patrol flagged down a train approaching the wrecked section of
track, averting a possible derailment.
   Trains coming from Soweto to Johannesburg reportedly were
stoned. Firebombs were thrown at three buses and two delivery vans
in other townships, causing serious injuries to three blacks.
   The main power line between the black township of KwaMashu to
Durban was sabotaged during the night, stopping rail traffic for
several hours. Later, a train on the route was derailed and
commuters had to be transferred to buses.
   The nation's largest ports were operating normally, but in the
eastern Cape province half the workers were absent at East London
and there was a total boycott at Port Elizabeth docks.
   Mining company officials said only 24,500 of 540,000 black
employees at major mines were absent. The De Beers mining company
said black workers disrupted operations at three mines with a
strike to demand that June 16 be designated a paid holiday.
   It is illegal under national emergency regulations to call for
or participate in boycotts or illegal strikes, but many blacks have
become accustomed to observing June 16 as a holiday.
   In South Africa, there are no public holidays commemorating
events of specific significance to the 26 million black majority.
   Many stores and shops in downtown Johannesburg were closed, and
only a handful of buses and taxi-vans were operating in the city.
Trains arriving from Soweto and other nearby black townships were
nearly empty.
   The streets of Soweto were almost deserted. About 100 people
were scattered along the main road trying to hitch rides.
   Most of the township's 2.5 million residents appeared to have
slept late. The normally teeming main bus station was vacant.
   About 15 people gathered this morning in Avalon Cemetery at the
grave of Hector Pieterson, a 13-year-old boy shot by police during
the student march in Soweto in 1976.
   Pieterson's sister, Margot, 17, and his nephew, Hector Tabane,
6, put flowers on the grave, which bears a marker saying: ``Deeply
mourned by his parents, sisters, and a nation that remembers.''
   Popi Buthelezi, 29, a young girl who was hurt in the 1976
shootings, came to the graveside service in a wheelchair.
   The Soweto students had been protesting the use of Afrikaans,
the language of descendants of Dutch settlers, in their schools.
The shooting touched off a nationwide rampage in which, by official
count, 575 blacks were killed.
   The following month, the government announced that blacks could
choose the language of instruction in their schools.
   The anniversary has almost always been marked by violence,
particularly confrontations between black crowds and police trying
to halt observances.
   Last year, 11 people died despite a call by anti-apartheid
groups for a quiet observances.
   Slogans were painted on the walls of the Central Methodist
Church in Johannesburg, saying, ``Castro, Free Us,'' ``South Africa
Bleeds,'' and ``Cuba Will Liberate Africa.''
   The slogans were painted in yellow, green and black, the colors
of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, the only senator who
has endorsed Jesse Jackson, said Thursday the Democratic
presidential candidate has run a winning campaign in 1988 that
hasn't frightened voters as it did four years ago.
   Hollings, who joined fellow South Carolinian Jackson at a
Capitol Hill news conference, said the Jackson candidacy of 1988 is
markedly different from his 1984 campaign.
   ``I would think Jesse frightened the bejesus out of them four
years ago. I remember him standing up and saying his time has come!
`I want it all,''' said Hollings, who made an unsuccessful bid for
the presidency in 1984.
   ``This time he's run a winning campaign. He hasn't frightened
anyone. He's charmed them in all of those different debates and in
his own right has leveled off,'' he said.
   People are ``looking at Jesse Jackson not as a black but really
for his own philosophy with respect to hunger and nutrition and
jobs and drugs and everything else,'' Hollings said.
   ``That's why I think he's won support black and white and from
Vermont down to Texas and the state of Washington over to South
Carolina. It's a substantially different campaign'' than four years
ago.
   Hollings, who announced last week that he will vote for Jackson
at the Democratic National Convention, said that although Michael
Dukakis is ``the obvious winner'' of the party's presidential race,
Jackson has earned his support.
   Hollings also urged other ``super delegates'' whose states and
districts were won by Jackson to join him in voting for the
candidate. Super delegates are the unpledged public and party
officeholders who will attend the convention in Atlanta, July 18-21.
   ``The obvious winner is Governor Dukakis. For the good of the
party, we also ought to be supporting Reverand Jackson. That's why
coming from my home state, he won my home state, he certainly has
earned my vote'' at the convention, Hollings said.
   Other Democratic senators met with Jackson but no endorsement
was forthcoming.
   Jackson, ignoring rival Michael Dukakis' mathematical lock on
the Democratic nomination, has said he will seek out the support of
the super delegates. And he has repeatedly pointed to Hollings as
an example for other super delegates.
   The senator, in announcing his decision last week, said he
wanted to honor a native South Carolinian and join the delegates
supporting Jackson.
   Jackson has said he is not willing to concede the nomination to
Dukakis. ``My priority at this point is to seek the nomination,''
Jackson insisted.
   Dukakis holds a commanding 2-to-1 lead over Jackson in the
latest Associated Press delegate count, and leads by a wide margin
in the number of super delegates _ 348 to 54.
   Jackson's super delegates include 20 members of the House and
just one member of the Senate _ Hollings. Only three of his super
delegates are white.
   Dukakis's 348 super delegates include 62 non-whites.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Rebel Archbishop Not to Consecrate Bishops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has urged Archbishop
Marcel Lefebvre to abandon a consecration of bishops that would
split the church and probably get the rebel traditionalist
excommunicated, the Vatican said Thursday.
   Creating bishops without papal permission is against canon. It
seems a certain path to expulsion from the Roman Catholic Church
for the French archbishop, who has rebelled for two decades against
what he calls ``self-destructive'' changes in the church.
   Without being specific, the pope reminded Lefebvre by letter of
``the inevitable theological and canonical consequences that are
known to you.''
   Leaders of the church in France, Switzerland and West Germany
issued a joint statement Thursday urging Lefebvre to ``to change
his decision and we pray that he does not commit the unrepairable.''
   The last schism in the church occurred in 1870 over the dogma of
papal infallibity.
   Lefebvre, 82-year-old founder of the traditionalist St. Pius X
Fraternity based in Switzerland, said Wednesday he would consecrate
four followers as bishops June 30. The fraternity was named after
Piux X, who was pope in 1903-14 and who condemned religious
modernism.
   The Vatican said in a statement Thursday that, in a May 5
protocol worked out by Lefebvre and the Vatican, the pontiff gave
the archbishop permission to consecrate one bishop Aug. 15.
   Pope Paul VI barred Lefebvre in 1976 from saying Mass and giving
the sacraments, but the archbishop has ordained more than 200
priests who continue to use the 16th century Tridentine Mass, a
Latin rite for which special permission is required. His movement
claims millions of followers worldwide.
   According to the statement Thursday, the Vatican issued a
``pressing appeal to members of (Lefebvre's) Fraternity and their
followers ... to rethink their position and remain united'' with
the pope, ``assuring them that all measures will be taken to
guarantee their identity in full communion with the Catholic
Church.''
   Noting Lefebvre's announcement ``with profound pain,'' the
Vatican issued a chronology Thursday of its efforts in the past
seven months to resolve the dispute. It also published the texts of
the protocol and letters between the the archbishop and John Paul.
   Under the protocol, Lefebvre would have promised tobe faithful
to the church and pope and to accept the teachings of the Second
Vatican Council of 1962-65. The council simplified and modernized
the liturgy, instituting such reforms as celebration of the Mass in
the local language.
   The protocol required Lefebvre's recognition of the ``validity
of the Mass and the sacraments ... according to the rites ...
promulgated by Paul VI and by John Paul II,'' but would allow the
archbishop to use liturgy antedating the council.
   Lefebvre wrote to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the day after the
protocol insisting that consecration of the bishop take place June
30, the Vatican said.
   When his request was refused, it said, Lefebvre wrote to the
cardinal and John Paul renewing both his demand for June 30 and a
previous proposal that four bishops be consecrated.
   At one point in the exchange of correspondence with the pope,
Lefebvre said: ``The false ecumenism which lies at the origin of
all the innovations, in liturgy, in new relations between the
church and the world, in the conception of the church itself, leads
the church to its ruin and Catholics to apostasy.''
   John Paul responded: ``From a paternal heart, but with all the
gravity required by the present circumstances, I exhort you,
Venerable Brother, to renounce your plan, which, if realized, could
only appear as a schismatic act whose inevitable theological and
canonical consequences are known to you.''

<HEAD>Minister Vows To Continue Bethel After Release On Bail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Baptist minister who runs a
children's home the state ordered shut down vowed to keep it open
as he was released on bond on charges of assaulting a police
officer.
   The Rev. Herman Fountain, posting $40,000 bail on three felony
counts, walked out late Wednesday and said, ``I plan to continue
like I always have.''
   Bethel Home for Children, operated by Fountain's independent
Baptist group, was ordered closed down June 10 when a judge ruled
its residents were subjected to ``physical abuse, medical neglect
and detention amounting to imprisonment.''
   State welfare officials have taken custody of a total of 77
children, ages 10 to 17, from the home. About 50 have been released
to their parents and the status of the others is pending.
   Meanwhile, Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain said he had
hidden his 13-year-old daughter because of kidnapping threats
following the closure of Bethel.
   Brittain said he decided to hide his daughter after callers
talked of kidnapping and putting her in a home such as Bethel.
   Fountain, 38, was arrested Monday when officers went to the
campus church to search for children who had run off when the home
was shut down. He was accused of scuffling with some of the
officers who were serving subpoenas on staff members.
   Before state welfare workers arrived at the home June 10 to take
custody of the children, most had fled. Law officers later found
about 60 children hiding at private residences and roaming the
streets of Lucedale. About 60 state troopers and local law officers
raided Fountain's church Monday to search for others. Eleven
children were taken into custody at that time.
   Fountain has refused to give the state a list of the children
that were at the home. He also has said he has taken in an
additional child since the court order.
   The state has required that parents or guardians to regain
custody must sign a statment promising not to send the children
back to Bethel.

   A 32-year-old man was in stable condition
Thursday after he was impaled on a wrought-iron fence and had to be
rushed to the hospital on a flat-bed truck with the fence spike
sticking through his leg, authorities said.
   Mark Smith, whose last known address was a shelter in Hartford,
was found hanging from the fence he was climbing with a spearlike
iron spike stuck through his leg below his knee.
   A security guard called police early Wednesday to report a man
yelling from behind Christ Church Cathedral, police said.
   The spike was about 2 inches thick at the top and the tip was
pointed, making its extraction extremely difficult, police said.
Rescuers cut a section of about 3 feet square using blowtorches.
   Doctors at Hartford Hospital relaxed Smith's muscles and pull
the fence spear from his leg, police said.
   ``They made an ambulance out of a wrecker,'' said Harvey L.
Kagan, president of Professional Ambulance Service. ``They couldn't
get the man in the ambulance with the fence.''

   Five big trucks and four other vehicles
piled up in a series of accidents on smoke-shrouded Interstate 10
on Thursday, killing one driver and injuring 18 people, authorities
said.
   The Highway Patrol said the wreckage blocked the freeway for
eight hours.
   The accidents began around 1:45 a.m. after dense smoke from a
woods fire reduced visibility on the highway north of Pascagoula.
Jackson County forester Andy Redwood said the fire, which charred
about 150 acres of woods about 100 yards north of the interstate,
had been brought under control Wednesday night.
   Besides five 18-wheel tractor-trailer rigs, the wreck involved
two cars, a pickup and a van, said Highway Patrol Capt. Richard
Smith.
   Eight people were admitted at Singing River Hospital at
Pascagoula in stable condition. Seven people were treated and
released. At Ocean Springs Hospital, two people were in
satisfactory condition and a third was treated and released.
   The dead person's identity was not immediately released.

   A leading Soviet film director visiting Israel
praised books banned in his country, said the Kremlin should renew
ties with the Jewish state and showed Soviet immigrants his latest
movie.
   Eldar Ryazanov, secretary of the Soviet Cinematographers Union,
also told about 1,000 Soviet Jews at Wednesday night's screening
that some political emigrants should be pardoned and allowed to
visit the land of their birth.
   Ryazanov hailed Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ``the most humane
leader'' in the Soviet Union in decades. He cited reforms that
allowed him and his wife to visit Israel.
   Ryazonov is the highest-ranking Soviet artist to come to Israel
since such visits became possible about a year ago. Travel from the
Soviet Union to Israel was barred after the Kremlin severed ties in
1967, and Soviet artists who did visit the West usually traveled
without their families.
   ``But it's very tragic to spend a lifetime before starting to
enjoy freedom,'' said Ryazanov.
   The 60-year-old filmmaker, who is known for satirical comedies,
greeted former compatriots in halting Hebrew and won applause as he
said ties between Israel and the Soviet Union should be restored.
   Ryazanov then switched to native Russian to praise Gorbachev's
reforms, but almost in the same breath said he just resigned from a
job at the Soviet Television in protest over state censorship.
   Answering written questions, he praised books by exiled Nobel
Prize winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who now lives in the United
States, and called ``The Gulag Archipelago'' ``a work of vast
social importance.'' Solzhenitsyn's books are banned in the Soviet
Union.
   But Ryazanov omitted the writer's name when he said some
political emigrants _ such as theater director Yuri Lyubimov, who
took Israeli citizenship, and writers Vasily Aksyonov of the United
States and Naum Korzavin of France _ should get back their Soviet
citizenship.
   ``They should be able to choose where to live while being able
to travel freely to their homeland,'' Ryazanov said. ``Freedom to
travel ... is as natural as freedom to breathe.''
   He noted that the airplane that brought him to Israel was packed
with Soviet Jews visiting emigrant relatives in Israel. ``They
could not see their relatives for years. There were embraces,
tears, and one couldn't watch it calmly.''
   In recent months, hundreds of Soviet Jews have been allowed to
visit relatives in Israel, and some immigrants are permitted to
travel to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union also allowed 4,695 Jews to emigrate this year.
Israel officially estimates as many as 380,000 want to leave, but
an Israeli delegation leader who recently visited the Soviet Union
put the figure at 25,000.
   Ryazanov said that he tried ``to use freedom as much as
possible'' in his 1987 romantic comedy ``Forgotten Melody For A
Flute,'' which was screened for the Israeli audience.
   The movie is about a Soviet bureaucrat who is married to a woman
he doesn't love but whose influential father promises to help his
career. The hero must decide whether to remain married or run off
with a poor nurse he loves.
   ``At last Soviet lovers have sex,'' said one immigrant viewer,
referring to a scene in which the adulterous couple is shown naked
in bed. Others praised the film for making fun of Soviet censorship
and influence peddling.

<TEXT>
   The head of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration warned Thursday that the United States is losing its
position as leader of the world's industrial nations because it is
spending less now on technical research and development.
   James Fletcher, in a speech prepared for the National Conference
on Strategic Management of Research and Development, said the
nation is ``just now beginning to recognize a long-term drought in
the national technical capability.''
   For instance, he said, the American machine tool industry ``has
been swamped'' by Japan, West Germany and Italy and the U.S. market
share of civil aircraft has dropped to 65 percent ``and promises to
continue its decline.''
   ``We have focused on marketing old products in newer packages at
the expense of investments in innovation and evolutionary
improvements,'' the NASA administrator said.
   Fletcher said the federal investment in aeronautics and space
research and development has declined, causing NASA to be less bold
in its technological innovation and exploration of the unknown.
   ``This is the wrong direction for leadership,'' he said. ``This
is living off the advances of the past _ in NASA's case, of the
Apollo era.''
   Fletcher said that if the U.S. trends continue in technology,
``NASA and the nation will become net consumers, not producers, of
science and the technology it makes possible. If that occurs, the
climb back to any position of parity in world affairs will be
arduous indeed, and certainly not certain of success.''

   The Kremlin on Thursday stepped up its campaign
for information on 300 Red Army soldiers missing in Afghanistan,
and the Soviet Red Cross appealed for the return of prisoners held
by Afghan guerrillas.
   Dmitri Venediktov, chairman of the Soviet Red Cross and Red
Crescent societies, appealed for help from the governments of
Pakistan, Iran and the United States as well as from Afghanistan's
guerrillas, who according to one estimate are holding up to 250
Soviets prisoner.
   On Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
summoned the Pakistani ambassador in Moscow to ask for help finding
missing soldiers and freeing POWs. The official Soviet news agency
Tass quoted Venediktov as saying he had made similar requests to
the Pakistani Red Cross Society.
   ``The reply to the first request has said the Pakistan Red Cross
Society does not know if there are Soviet POWs (prisoners of war)
in that country. A response to the second request has yet to
come,'' Venediktov told Tass.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told
reporters Monday that previous appeals to Pakistan had led to the
release of some Soviet prisoners, but he did say when or how many.
   Gerasimov also said Pakistan continued to channel U.S.-supplied
arms to the guerrillas, which he said violated the Geneva accords
on an Afghan settlement.
   In New York on Wednesday, expatriate Soviet artist Mihail
Chemiakin and American writers, scholars and religious figures
announced the formation of the International Committee for the
Rescue of Russian Prisoners of War in Afghanistan.
   The only Soviet citizen on the committee, Iona Andronov, New
York correspondent for the weekly Literary Gazette, said that 250
of the missing Soviets were being held by the guerrillas.
   A statement from the committee, distributed by Tass, said that
``even some Americans unfriendly to the Soviet Union, after
visiting the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan, have told of the killing of
Soviet POWs, how prior to their execution the young men's eyes were
torn out, their noses, ears and genitals cut off.''
   ``Sometimes, the doomed prisoners are skinned alive,'' the
statement asserted. ``American eyewitnesses also inform us that
those POWs who have survived so far are chained hand and foot and
held underground in constant darkness.''
   The Soviets have said they had 100,300 soldiers in Afghanistan
before they began pulling them out May 15. Under the terms of the
U.N.-sponsored agreement on Afghanistan signed in Geneva in April,
half of the Soviet troops are supposed to be home by Aug. 15 and
the remainder by Feb. 15.
   Tass reported Thursday that seven people were killed and 13 were
wounded by rockets fired by Afghan guerrillas into a residential
neighborhood of Kabul.
   The agency, in a dispatch from Kabul, gave few details of the
attack, which occurred Wednesday night, except to say that the dead
included women and children and that several houses were destroyed.

<TEXT>
   Mari Maseng, who left the White House last
year to be press secretary to Sen. Bob Dole's presidential
campaign, will return to work for President Reagan as chief of
communications and planning, succeeding Thomas C. Griscom, it was
announced Thursday.
   Griscom submitted his resignation, effective June 30. He did not
disclose what he planned to do next, though he had said for months
that he planned to leave the White House after the Moscow summit.
   Griscom joined the White House in February 1987 when former Sen.
Howard Baker, his long-time associate, took over as chief of staff.
As director of communications and planning, Griscom was in charge
of the speechwriting staff, planning Reagan's agenda and arranging
special events, such as the superpower summit meetings in
Washington and Moscow.
   In his resignation letter, he said he would remember the summits
as the high point of his tenure.
   Ms. Maseng, 34, worked at the White House on two occasions
during the Reagan administration. She was a member of Reagan's
speechwriting team from January 1981 until November 1983, and
director of the office of public liaison, responsibile for contact
with constituent groups, from May 1986 until July 1987.
   In addition, she served as assistant secretary for public
affairs at the Transportation Department in between her White House
jobs.
   When she left the White House in 1987, she became press
secretary to Dole's presidential campaign, a post she held until
his withdrawal as a candidate earlier this year. Since then, she
has worked as a management and public affairs consultant.
   Dole, R-Kan., the Senate's Republican leader, said in a
statement: ``I congratulate Mari, and wish her all the best in her
new assignment. She is everything you would want in a staffer:
tireless, committed and loyal. The president will be well served.''

   Mortars and rockets whizzed through two
refugee camps in Beirut on Thursday, leaving 12 people dead and 29
injured as rival Palestinian groups fought for control of the areas.
   In southeast Lebanon, Israeli soldiers killed two Lebanese
guerrillas in an ambush on the western slopes of Mount Hermon,
police said.
   Police said the new casualties in Beirut brought the toll to 31
people killed and 130 wounded since the latest clashes over the
Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camps broke out last week.
   The thuds of exploding shells resounded as ambulances evacuated
casualties from the two shantytowns on the southern outskirts of
the Lebanese capital.
   The Fatah guerrilla group of Yasser Arafat's mainstream
Palestine Liberation Organization accused the breakaway faction
called Fatah-Uprising of indiscriminate shelling. The group
rebelled against Arafat's leadership with Syrian backing in May
1983.
   A spokesman for Arafat's group, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the rival group was shelling both refugee camps
from the outside. He said his group repulsed several attacks.
   A police spokesman said Fatah-Uprising rebels shelled the camps
from Syrian-controlled territory in west Beirut and the seaside
suburb of Ouzai.
   The police spokesman confirmed Fatah-Uprising tried but failed
to enter the camps. The fighting raged despite efforts by a
committee of representatives from seven neutral Palestinian groups
to supervise a cease-fire.
   In southeast Lebanon, Israeli gunners and helicopter gunships
attacked the terrain north of Israel's self-proclaimed security
zone while pursuing a guerrilla group, another police spokesman
said.
   He said the hunt by Israel and their militia allies, the South
Lebanon Army, ended when two guerrillas from the Lebanese Communist
Party were killed in an ambush north of the security zone.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified according to police
regulations, said an Israeli patrol set up the ambush overnight
north of the zone and confronted the communist group as it left to
carry out an attack in the zone.

   More than 1,000 coal miners hooted and
cheered as union leaders and miners denounced proposed federal
safety rule changes at a public hearing Thursday.
   The hearing was punctuated by catcalls, shouts and standing
ovations from the miners, who union officials said were on a
contract-sanctioned day off from 87 mines in Illinois and Indiana.
   The United Mine Workers is staging rallies at public hearings on
the proposed changes being conducted around the country by the Mine
Safety and Health Administration. Thursday's hearing was the fourth
of six planned.
   ``Excuse me,'' said moderator Patricia Silvey, trying to quiet
the crowd. ``This will be an orderly proceeding.''
   Jerry Jones, president of UMW District 12 in Illinois, also
appealed for order, then accused the Reagan administration of
putting the interests of mine owners before safety.
   ``Their position is that they want to get government out of
industry,'' Jones said. ``Now surely a coal operator, for example,
should know how to operate his mine. But deregulation has not been
effective.''
   Some miners carried signs reading, ``We give our sweat but not
our blood,'' and ``Laws to live by, not die by.''
   The proposals on underground mine ventilation include
elimination of required 20-minute checks for methane gas, an
increase in the allowable limits of methane and a lifting of the
requirement that miners be evacuated whenever ventilation fans
break down.
   Representatives from the federal agency maintained that the
proposed changes partly reflect improvements in mine monitoring
systems.
   ``We included several new provisions in the proposals that we
think would be definite (safety) improvements,'' said Ms. Silvey,
director of the agency's Office of Standards, Regulations and
Variances.
   She said the changes include a provision for electronic systems
that continuously monitor mine air for methane and oxygen
deficiencies.
   Miner Robert M. Danner, from nearby Newburgh, said methane fire
is one of the miners' greatest fears. He recalled an accident at
the Madisonville, Ky., mine where he worked 15 years ago.
   ``We had an ignition and a roll of fire came across the man from
a pocket of gas,'' Danner said. ``It didn't kill him, but it
charred him black. It's a horrible site if you've ever seen a man
who's just been burned to a crisp.''
   The union contends the rule changes were designed primarily to
save mining companies money.
   However, testimony from companies at previous hearings indicates
that use of the electronic air monitoring system does not guarantee
higher profits, said Richard Zuetenhorst, a deputy director in the
federal mining regulations office.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis endorsed the
idea of a special counsel to investigate House Speaker Jim Wright
on Thursday and said Wright was willing to go along in contrast
``to the kind of stonewalling we've had from the administration.''
   Asked about Wright as he opened a Southern campaign swing,
Dukakis said he understood the Texas Democrat had ``welcomed the
independent counsel.''
   Wright said Thursday in Washington that he would welcome the
hiring of an outside investigator by the House ethics committee if
that would speed up the panel's probe of his financial dealings.
   Dukakis was in Nashville to receive the endorsement of Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, one of his former rivals for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   During the primary campaign, Gore had compared Dukakis to the
Democratic presidential candidates who had lost four of the past
five national elections.
   But Gore, who dropped out of the race after losing badly in the
New York primary, said, ``I think that Mike Dukakis' image in the
South and all over the country is very different than many people
thought it was going to be when this campaign began.''
   Gore differed strongly with Dukakis on defense and foreign
policy issues during the campaign. But he said Thursday, ``I was
pleased to see not only Mike Dukakis but all of us learning from
each other.''
   Dukakis, when asked if he hoped to get a similar endorsement
from Jesse Jackson before the Democratic convention next month,
said, ``I would hope Jesse Jackson will be a part of this campaign
and as early as possible.''
   Jackson has vowed to continue his campaign until the convention
roll call that decides the nomination.
   Dukakis already has far more than the delegates he needs for a
majority on that roll call.
   Asked if he was concerned at the prospect of Wright presiding
over the convention at the same time he was under investigation,
Dukakis said, ``I thought there was a presumption of innocence in
this country, certainly one I believe in.''
   At the same time, he said he has called for Attorney General
Edwin Meese III to resign. ``I certainly have,'' said the
Massachusetts governor. ``That's after repeated evidence of
insensitivity, a lack of awareness of what we mean when we talk
about high standards.''
   ``If you're attorney general of this country and you've stumbled
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided
as weak leadership as he has, you ought to leave office,'' Dukakis
said.
   He said that Wright's attitude toward the idea of an independent
counsel ``contrasts rather sharply with the kind of stonewalling
we've had from the administration on case after case after case.''
   He said Wright's approach was ``the way that we ought to respond
to these kind of things.''
   Gore said he was confident Dukakis would carry five or six
states in the South against Republican George Bush.

   Radical mobs shouting about government
corruption attacked riot squads Thursday, and police said they
arrested six students who tried to throw firebombs at the home of
former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Fighting began at the University of Foreign Studies in eastern
Seoul when police fired volleys of tear gas to keep 1,000 radicals
from five nearby schools from marching off the campus.
   Students hurled firebombs and rocks for two hours, screaming
``Punish criminals!'' ``Yankee go home!'' and other demands for
withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under
a mutual defense pact.
   Anti-Americanism has become a strong element in recent protests
by the radical students, who contend the United States enforces
partition of the Korean peninsula and treats the South as a colony.
   Twenty students throwing firebombs dashed toward Chun's home
Wednesday night, but tear gas stopped them 150 yards short of the
target and six were arrested, police reported.
   They said the students flung six firebombs at riot officers and
a nearby police post afterward, shouting: ``Investigate corruption
under the former government!'' No damage or injuries were reported.
   Police seized 48 firebombs and leaflets accusing Chun of
corruption and abuse of power during his seven years in office,
which ended in February. They demanded a full investigation and
punishment.
   Accusations of corruption and embezzlement of funds have been
made against Chun and members of his family since he left office.
The political opposition also claims Chun, a former general put in
power by the army, was responsible for numerous cases of torture
and brutality.
   Radical students accuse Chun; President Roh Tae-woo, a fellow
general who succeeded him; and the United States of responsibility
for military repression of a 1980 civil uprising in the southern
city of Kwangju. Nearly 200 people were killed, according to
government figures.
   Minor clashes were reported Thursday in Taejon, another southern
city, between police and students denouncing the blockade of a
march to the border with communist North Korea.
   Much larger battles occurred Jun 10 when police stopped
thousands of radicals from marching to the border for meetings with
North Korean students on reunifying the peninsula, which was
divided in 1945.
   In another development, Chief Justice Kim Yong-chun of the
Supreme Court said Thursday he would resign in response to calls by
junior magistrates for judicial reform.
   On Wednesday, 85 judges issued a statement saying the judiciary
is seen as subservient to the government and has not benefited from
recent democratic changes. It was the first such collective action
by judges in the nation's history.
   Another 194 judges joined in a supporting statement Thursday and
support for the demand is expected to continue growing among the
940 magistrates in South Korea.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush are running neck-and-neck in the South but the tide could turn
quickly against Dukakis if he selects Jesse Jackson as his running
mate, a poll released Thursday showed.
   Democratic pollster Claibourne Darden Jr. said the survey of 750
voters in nine Southern states found that the Massachusetts
governor and the vice president are in a statistical tie among
traditionally conservative Southern voters. Dukakis was the choice
of 45.1 percent, Bush 42.3 percent and 12.7 percent were undecided.
   The telephone poll was conducted June 8-13 among voters in what
Darden described as the ``hard-core Southern states'' of Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee. The margin of error was 3.6
percent.
   ``It's a horse race, but Dukakis is on shaky ground,'' Darden
said.
   Of the people surveyed who said they would vote for Dukakis,
``four of 10 are for Dukakis not because of Dukakis but because
they dislike Bush. ... An `anti' vote early in a campaign is based
on personality, and can leave you very quickly,'' he said.
   Bush, among other things, must ``learn to speak English,'' by
bringing his vocabulary down to earth, Darden said.
   With the two likely nominees running neck-and-neck, the vice
presidential choice becomes critical, Darden said. For Dukakis to
choose Jackson ``would be disastrous in the South,'' the pollster
said.
   Only 25.8 percent said the selection of Jackson for the No. 2
spot would make them more inclined to vote for Dukakis, while 53.1
percent said they would be less inclined to vote Democratic. Some
21.2 percent were undecided.
   ``I think everyone has to be surprised at how well Dukakis is
doing in the South,'' Darden said, but he added that because it is
based largely on an anti-Bush sentiment, ``George Bush, himself, is
doing more to break the Republican `lock' on the South than Michael
Dukakis is doing.''

   The Navy and the State Department are
investigating allegations that Marine security guards stationed in
Havana improperly fraternized with Cuban women, officials said
Thursday.
   The investigation focuses on four Marines and their off-duty
social activities and does not involve any allegations of
espionage, the officials said.
   Two years ago, a similiar fraternization scandal erupted
involving Marine guards at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. One Marine
was convicted of espionage.
   ``Right now, there is no indication of the four of them being
involved in anything except fraternization,'' Lt. Col. John
Shotwell, a Marine Corps spokesman, said of the latest case. ``And
the investigation is still continuing.''
   The Pentagon, in a brief statement, said the four guards ``have
been returned to their parent unit, the Marine Security Guard
Battalion, located at Quantico, Va.,'' pending completion of the
investigation.
   ``Four Marine security guards assigned to the U.S. diplomatic
post in Cuba, the U.S. Interest Section, co-located with the Swiss
embassy, are suspected of fraternization with local civilians in
violation of State Department policy,'' the statement added.
   ``The Naval Security and Investigative Command, in coordination
with the State Department, is conducting a routine investigation of
the matter. Because the matter is under investigation, and no
individuals have been charged with any wrong-doing, it would be
premature to release any details at this time.''
   The State Department and Marine Corps forbid fraternization
between security guards and local women at posts in the Soviet
Union, the Warsaw Pact countries and several other nations,
including communist Cuba.
   According to Pentagon sources, the alleged fraternization among
guards in Cuba included sexual intercourse during several contacts
that occurred late last year and early this year.
   The sources, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not
identified, said the allegations came to light in February when two
Cuban women sought asylum at the Canadian embassy, claiming they
feared arrest for consorting with foreigners. The women had with
them the names of some Marine guards, the officials said.
   Assuming no evidence of espionage is developed, the sources said
the four Marines would probably face only administrative
disciplinary action and not courts-martial.
   According to the Marine Corps, the guard force in Cuba for the
interests section includes one detachment commander and seven
watchstanders.

<HEAD>House Gives Approval to $44.1 Billion Farm Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a $44.1 billion money bill
for farm programs and food aid Thursday with fewer complaints this
year from urban lawmakers that payment programs have gotten out of
hand.
   ``Everyone's pointing to agriculture like we're the ones who are
causing the deficit, like we're all causing all this international
debt,'' Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza said.
   He said agriculture represented only a small part of the
estimated $176 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year that
starts Oct. 1.
   ``They stumble over that much at the Pentagon,'' the Texas
Democrat said.
   Farm payment programs, which include price supports, income
supports and conservation payments, peaked at $26 billion in 1986.
Those programs now are down to an estimated $17 billion in fiscal
1988.
   The drop in overall farm payments has muted somewhat the chorus
of complaints that met 1985 legislation designed to alleviate
painful problems in the farm economy.
   But while farm payments have gone down as the farm economy has
recovered, a number of critics of ``excesses'' in the farm programs
say there still is much to complain about.
   The House voted 343-54 to approve the money bill amid calls from
farm-bloc lawmakers for aid to growers and livestock producers
squeezed financially by a drought across broad areas of the country.
   The bill earmarked no drought aid, however, and most lawmakers
said they were inclined to go along with administration suggestions
that it would be best to wait until the full extent of the problem
becomes clear.
   The Agriculture Department has been saying an inch or so of rain
once a week for the rest of the growing season would rescue Midwest
corn and soybeans, although wheat in Montana and the Dakotas is in
far worse condition.
   The bill calls for outlays of $44.1 billion for the fiscal 1989
for programs ranging from farm payments to food stamps. That is
$2.5 billion less than requested by President Reagan and $12
billion below last year's amount.
   It also is $3 billion below an agricultural appropriations bill
currently being drawn up in the Senate.
   It contains $16.3 billion for food and nutrition programs, $12.4
billion for rural development and $6.8 billion to replace losses of
the government-owned Commodity Credit Corp., which operates federal
payment programs for farmers.
   Farm program spending has dropped sharply over the last year as
exports expanded and the farm economy shook off the doldrums of the
early 1980s.
   Thus a $14.3 billion decrease in funds to cover losses of the
Commodity Credit Corp. represents the bill's major savings.
Critics, however, said it is optimistic to expect a sale of
government-held stocks will yield $3 billion to help cover
additional losses and hold down costs.
   ``It appears to me there are lots of mirrors on the ceiling and
lots of smoke coming from the cloakroom,'' Rep. Robert S. Walker,
R-Pa., said.
   Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said it most likely would be
necessary to come back for a supplemental appropriation later.
   The House debated for two hours a plan by Rep. Joseph J.
DioGuardi, R-N.Y., to bar further Farmers Home Administration loans
to farmers already in default. But farm forces defeated, 310-88, a
parliamentary maneuver designed to bring up his proposal for a vote.
   ``Everybody knows that you don't lend money to people who never
paid you back on you're previous loans,'' DioGuardi said.
``Everybody but the United States of America.''
   Farm state lawmakers were quick to take up DioGuardi's challenge.
   ``This gentleman who comes here from New York and suggests that
the farmers are trying to pull the wool over the Farmers Home
Administration just hasn't been there to share the problems,'' said
Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.
   The Targeted Export Assistance program, established in 1985 as a
subsidy for overseas advertising and promotion of food exports
exports, came under renewed criticism from Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y.
   ``Even if the program were extremely well run, maybe we ought
not to be funding it,'' he said. He pointed to millions of dollars
paid out to private companies for advertising campaigns abroad.
   Schumer cited a report from the General Accounting Office that
found program mismanagement.

   The Peace Corps is sending volunteers to
Pakistan for the first time in 21 years and will begin a new
program in the Comoros Islands off Africa, agency director Loret
Miller Ruppe said Thursday.
   A Peace Corps assessment team will also go to China this summer,
to plan for the first set of volunteers for that country, Mrs.
Ruppe told a luncheon audience at the National Press Club.
   The three new programs will bring to nearly 70 the number of
countries welcoming the Peace Corps, and Mrs. Ruppe said the
grass-roots agency hopes to grow even bigger.
   ``Those cynics who wonder if the Peace Corps is still around
should know that the Congress and the president have not only
endorsed, but mandated, a five-year growth plan for the Peace Corps
to double in size to 10,000 volunteers by 1992,'' she said.
   The agency, whose last program in Pakistan ended in 1967, is
sending eight volunteers to Islamabad and Lahore this fall to train
high school teachers. The emphasis will be on training English
teachers, but education courses for biology, chemistry and physics
instructors also will be given.
   Nine volunteers will be assigned to the Comoros Islands, an
Islamic nation 250 miles off the coast of Mozambique. They will
arrive in July for language and cultural training and begin working
in September, Mrs. Ruppe said.
   The China program is scheduled to begin sometime next year.
   Since Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian's announcement in
March that China would welcome the Peace Corps, the agency has
received 300 public queries from Americans declaring their
eagerness to participate in the Chinese program, said agency
spokesman James C. Flanigan.
   ``That's a fairly good number of people expressing an interest
in going to a particular country,'' Flanigan said. The Peace Corps
never guarantees a volunteer's choice of country, but Flanigan said
the agency was bouyed by the interest shown in China.
   At the time of Wu's announcement, officials said an
English-teaching program would be the most likely plan and that the
initial complement would be about 50 volunteers. The assessment
team will discuss the location of the first group.
   ``It's very much their call,'' Mrs. Ruppe said of the Chinese.
   The Peace Corps was created during the Kennedy administration to
spread skills to the grass roots of developing countries and
broaden the horizons of young Americans. Despite conservative
hostility to the agency at the outset of the Reagan administration,
it has grown in the past seven years.
   The Peace Corps gets 200,000 queries a year from potential
volunteers, of whom 17,000 fill out applications and 2,600 are
accepted. Currently, the agency is particularly interested in
people with skills as teacher trainers and agriculture experts,
Mrs. Ruppe said.
   In its expansion plans, the agency will try to increase the size
of some of its contingents and try to get more nations to accept
volunteers. During its heyday, the agency's biggest program was in
India, where up to 1,600 volunteers served. The biggest one is now
in Honduras, where there are 300 Peace Corps people.
   South America would be a fertile ground for new programs, Mrs.
Ruppe said. On that continent, only Paraguay and Ecuador accept
volunteers, she said.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Up in April as Sales Slow</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose moderately as sales
slackened in April, the government said Thursday in a report
signaling slower economic growth for the second quarter.
   The Commerce Department said inventories climbed 0.5 percent to
a seasonally adjusted $723.7 billion in April. The gain came as
total business sales fell 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$478.8 billion.
   The rise in goods stockpiled on shelves and backlots followed a
0.3 percent climb in March and a 0.4 percent increase in February.
The slight drop in business sales came after a 1.9 percent jump in
March, the largest in more than a year, and a 1.1 percent gain in
February.
   Economists generally take rising inventories as a sign that
buying demand is slowing and as an indication that manufacturers
may have to cut back production.
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the Wefa Group, an economic
forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said April inventory
growth was ``slightly disturbing'' and would be ``a real source of
concern'' if it continued.
   But he said he expected smaller growth in the months ahead and
did not foresee a return to the high rate of inventory expansion
from October to January, when monthly increases ranged from 0.7
percent to 1.2 percent.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
goverment securities dealer in New York, said slower growth in the
economy as a whole, as measured by the gross national product, may
be a ``blessing in disguise.''
   ``The inventory numbers certainly signal the likelihood we'll
grow at a slower pace. Maybe GNP will hit 2.5 percent in the second
quarter, compared with 3.9 percent in the first quarter,'' Jones
said.
   ``But that may be desireable because it could well make it
possible to maintain more sustained growth without a sharp
acceleration of inflationary pressure,'' he said.
   Inventories in April were 7.9 percent higher than a year ago,
while sales were 7.6 percent greater.
   The rise in April inventories included a 0.9 percent increase at
the wholesale level, a 0.4 percent rise in goods held by
manufacturers and a 0.3 percent growth at the retail level.
   The 0.2 percent decline in business sales was paced by 0.4
percent drops in both wholesale and retail sales. Sales by
manufacturers were unchanged.
   In an advance report on Wednesday, the government said retail
sales edged up only 0.1 percent in May.
   The combination of falling sales and moderately rising
inventories pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio up from 1.50 in
March to 1.51 in April. That means it would take 1.51 months to
exhaust inventories at the April sales pace, a ratio not considered
abnormally high.

   The Pentagon, recovering from an accident in
January, has successfully resumed its testing of a chemical laser
that one day could become a key part of any Star Wars anti-missile
defense system, officials said Thursday.
   The latest test of the so-called Alpha laser was conducted
Wednesday night behind closed doors at a contractor's laboratory in
San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
   It marked the final check-out of all the laser components and
support equipment and was considered a complete success, said
Richard Garcia, a spokesman for the Air Force Weapons Laboratory at
Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.
   The test replicated all the heat and pressure effects that will
exist when a laser beam is produced in the new system, but by
design no ``lasing'' was attempted on Wednesday, said Garcia.
   The next and final stage of the testing program _ producing a
high-powered laser beam through a chemical reaction _ will probably
begin this fall, the spokesman added.
   The test conducted Wednesday evening had been scheduled several
months ago but was put off indefinitely while engineers repaired
damage caused during a brief, accidental fire on Jan. 7.
   The fire at the TRW Inc. laboratory resulted from an operating
mistake by a worker. Little direct damage was done, but the fire
left contaminated the main vacuum chamber needed to simulate firing
the laser in outer space, and thus halted all testing.
   ``The Air Force Weapons Laboratory completed a milestone test of
its Alpha laser on Wednesday,'' Garcia said in a statement.
   ``The laser successfully completed a hot flow test with heat
released from the cavity. This test verified that all supporting
assemblies were operating properly and that Alpha was ready to
begin receiving the optical components necessary for full lasing
tests.''
   The experiment ``was as close as we can get to lasing without
actually doing it,'' the spokesman added.
   The Alpha laser, described by the Pentagon as ``the most mature
of the (Star Wars) directed-energy technologies,'' has been under
study for almost a decade.
   The device is constructed primarily of aluminum, making it
relatively light and compact, and draws its energy from the
combustion of the gases hydrogen and fluorine. It is thought to
generate roughly 2 million watts of power.
   Last October, the Pentagon awarded a contract to Martin Marietta
Corp., asking it to assess the possibility of conducting
experiments in space with Alpha. In the meantime, however, TRW _
which built the device _ began preparing for the first ground tests
in the laboratory.

   Eight inmates, three of them convicted
murderers, escaped Thursday from the only maximum-security
penitentiary in Kentucky, and authorities say they likely split up
after they fled.
   At least nine other inmates also tried but failed to flee the
Kentucky State Penitentiary after several small fires were started
in another section of the building to divert guards, said prison
spokesman Bobby Waller.
   The escapees apparently sawed their sliding cell doors from
their tracks and then cut through a prison window early Thursday
morning, officials said.
   One prisoner was found hanging from the window, he said, and
eight other single-man cells had cut marks on them, indicating
those prisoners also tried to get out, said Waller.
   Barry Banister, another spokesman, said the search was
concentrated in the area around the penitentiary, which is five
miles east of Eddyville.
   Authorities said dogs had tracked the scent of at least one
escapee to a spot about a half-mile away where a pickup was stolen.
   ``We have reason to believe that based on various reports, they
may have split up,'' Waller said.
   The prison, near Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake, is surrounded
on three sides by water and on the fourth by woods, Waller said.
``It's very easy for an individual to elude us,'' he said.
   Waller said officials believed the escape was the state's
largest.
   The fires broke out in the administrative control unit, which
houses ``the worst of the worst,'' said Waller. The escapees were
in another area, he said.
   State police dispatched two light airplanes to help in the
search, along with troopers, the dog team, local authorities and 60
prison officers.
   Meanwhile in North Carolina, a $5,000 reward was offered
Thursday by authorities for information leading to the arrest of
any of the four prisoners who escaped Sunday night from the
Cumberland County Jail in Fayetteville.
   ``The search for the missing four men is still at an intense
level,'' said Sheriff Morris Bedsole. ``We are not going to let up
until they are back in the jail.''

   Taking a rare active role in an ongoing
federal investigation, President Reagan told top law enforcement
officials Thursday to move ``as rapidly as possible'' to get the
facts in a burgeoning Pentagon fraud investigation.
   Reagan, who told Congress two years ago that he did not want
lawmakers ``scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet'' in the
defense budget, was described by spokesman Marlim Fitzwater as
``very concerned'' about allegations of bribe-paying and kickbacks.
   ``I think we're all aware of the wide scope of this
investigation,'' Fitzwater said, ``and it certainly poses an
internal security problem and an abuse problem of dimensions that
have to be dealt with forthrightly.''
   ``I'm just not at liberty to expand on any of the details,'' he
said when asked to elaborate.
   Federal investigators armed with evidence from two years' worth
of wiretaps and this week's coast-to-coast raids are preparing to
approach witnesses who now may be forced to cooperate in the probe.
   The investigation has turned up ``rampant bribery in the
government'' and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of
cars and payments of bills for government employees, Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican member of the Armed
Services Committee, said Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said Reagan believes this is a matter ``that deserves
his attention, and that everyone involved should know of his
feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with any kinds
of crimes that have been committed here.''
   Government sources familiar with the probe said searches of
offices of 15 defense contractors on Tuesday stemmed from wiretaps
on the offices of two top Pentagon officials. The bugs have been in
place for much of the two-year investigation.
   Reagan in 1985 created a commission to study ways to streamline
Pentagon operations. The panel, headed by industrialist and former
Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard, recommended a stronger hand
for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a new civilian
office to oversee Defense Department purchasing.
   The commission also recommended that there be less
``micromanagement'' of the Pentagon by Congress _ and Reagan said
he agreed with that.
   ``Instead of scrutinizing every paper clip, bolt and bullet,
Congress should give more thought to our overall defense needs and
strategy,'' he said.
   On Thursday, Reagan met with Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
FBI Director William Sessions and top Justice Department
prosecutors. He had met Wednesday with Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci.
   Reagan seldom has involved himself directly in investigations of
alleged wrongdoing, although he was interviewed by a commission
that probed the Iran-Contra affair.
   Fitzwater said the president had not been told about the
Pentagon investigation at its outset, but was not disturbed by that.
   ``The FBI starts hundreds of investigations that are carried out
over a long period of time. The White House is not aware of most,
if not all of, those investigations,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said ``there always comes a time when any
investigation, when it's presented to the Justice Department for
criminal action or whether it's presented to a grand jury for
possible indictment, it becomes known to the civilian authority,
whether it's the president or the head of the agency or the bureau
or whatever.
   ``I'm sure that in this case, it was simply their judgment that
this was the right time to make it known to the Defense Department
and the White House,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the president was ``satisfied that the bureau has
acted with the Naval Investigative Service quickly and effectively
and pursued this investigation.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Propose Tightening OSHA Regulations In Wake Of Apartment
Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers who say the Occupational Safety and
Health Adminstration has taken little action to prevent
construction accidents such as last year's collapse of a
Connecticut apartment complex that killed 28 workers on Thursday
proposed tightening federal laws regulating construction.
   The legislation would stiffen OSHA fines, tighten accident
reporting requirements, mandate a professional engineer to oversee
construction projects, make negligent employers liable to stiff
prison terms and give the agency authority to shut down a work site
to investigate an accident.
   Connecticut lawmakers drafted the measure following House and
Senate hearings examining the April 23, 1987, collapse of
L'Ambiance Plaza, a half-built apartment complex in Bridgeport,
Conn. L'Ambiance Plaza was the worst construction accident in New
England history.
   ``It has been more than a year since L'Ambiance collapsed,''
said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., the chief House spnosor.
``Tragically, we have seen little movement to change any of the
factors that contributed to the accident.''
   Shays said he hoped the bill would ``arm OSHA with the proper
tools to help fulfill its mandate to protect worker health and
safety.''
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., the chief sponsor in the
Senate, said the country ``must not tolerate any more Willow
Islands or L'Ambiance Plazas or any of the thousands of other
accidents that claim lives and futures and could be avoided if
industry and government act swiftly and responsibly.''
   L'Ambiance Plaza was the nation's worst construction accident
since a cooling tower under construction in Willow Island, W. Va.,
collapsed in 1978, killing 51.
   The Shays-Weicker bill:
   _ Requires an onsite engineer or architect to oversee
construction projects.
   _ Increases maximum OSHA construction fines from $10,000 per
violation to $25,000.
   _ Increases maximum criminal penalties for first-time ``willful
violations'' from six months in prison and $10,000 in fines to 10
years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Repeat offenders would be
subject to 20 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   _ Gives OSHA officials the authority to close down a work site
to investigate an accident.
   _ Mandates employers to report accidents and for OSHA officials
to inspect within 24 hours when there are at least three workers
hospitalized, one ``life-threatening'' injury or fatality or a
collapse, partial collapse or near collapse of a building.
   Under current OSHA regulations, contractors are required to
report an accident only if a worker is killed or at least five are
seriously injured, and there is no mandate for OSHA inspections.

   Presidential candidates should thoroughly
evaluate their running mates and not make hasty decisions for the
occupant of the office a heartbeak away from the White House,
political experts said Thursday.
   ``The speed with which vice presidential candidates are selected
can still create serious problems,'' according to a report prepared
by a task force that included former top aides to Presidents
Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter.
   The report, commissioned by the 20th Century Fund, a non-profit
research organization, said the position of vice president, long
the butt of jokes, is critical because it is so close to the Oval
Office.
   To ensure the best person gets the nod, presidential candidates
could use a mix of tools: questionnaires, interviews, polls and
informal inquiries. In the end, however, politics plays a big role
in the selection.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Vice President George
Bush, respectively the expected 1988 Democratic and Republican
presidential nominees, have not revealed their choice of running
mate, but the issue is attracting widespread attention.
   James Cannon, a former aide to Ford, recalled that Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan., was a compromise vice presidential candidate in 1976.
   Although Ford maintains Dole was an asset, others viewed Dole as
``not a good candidate.'' Ford lost the election to Jimmy Carter.
   ``All too often you end up making the decision at 2 a.m.,''
Cannon said.
   Hugh Heclo, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax,
Va., criticized the selection process.
   He said vice presidential candidates William Miller in 1964;
Thomas Eagleton in 1972; Spiro Agnew in 1968 and Geraldine Ferraro
in 1984 were not ``shining successes of finding what the Founding
Fathers used to call the continental character.''
   Agnew, the only one of those candidates elected, was forced out
of office in a corruption scandal.
   On balance, the experts said the vice presidency is a healthy if
imperfect institution in which the incumbent can play a role
advising the president on a range of issues and representing the
United States abroad.
   But Helco and two other panel members, Arthur M. Schlesinger
Jr., Kennedy's former aide, and Henry F. Reuss, former chairman of
the Joint Economic Committee, suggested the vice presidency does
more harm than good and should be abolished.
   ``All you are trying to do is create some stand-by equipment,''
said Heclo, who argued that a special election could be held to
choose a successor to a disabled president.
   Reuss criticized the ``imperial nature'' of the vice presidency,
which comes with a mansion, a seal and its own aircraft, Air Force
Two. The vice president also has a large staff.
   ``The modern vice presidency that has developed with little
forethought over the past 30 years is proving a more disruptive
than constructive feature of our political system,'' the dissenters
said.

   An assailant shot and wounded
an Israeli soldier here Thursday, and troops rounded up dozens of
Arabs for questioning. One witness said suspects were forced to
stand on one foot under the hot sun.
   The army clamped a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city. It was the second shooting of an Israeli soldier since the
Arab uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip began Dec. 8.
   In a crackdown on the recent wave of firebomb attacks on Israeli
targets, troops demolished seven houses of Arab suspects and sealed
five other homes in the West Bank. Soldiers have been ordered to
shoot at firebomb throwers with the intent to injure and to
demolish the homes of suspects.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, dozens of Jewish settlers, some
wearing prayer shawls, blocked a major highway for two hours to
demand harsh army action against Palestinian firebombers.
   The army said the reserve soldier was traveling in his own car
when he was hit by a bullet. A spokesman declined to say if the
soldier was in uniform.
   The wounded soldier was taken by helicopter to a Tel Aviv
hospital and the shooting was being investigated, the spokesman
said. He said the soldier was slightly injured, but refused to
elaborate or identify him.
   The other Israeli soldier shot during the uprising, Sgt. Moshe
Katz, 28, died of a head wound received in the West Bank town of
Bethlehem on March 20.
   Troops conducted a search for suspects and the weapon, sealing
off Nablus and prohibiting all drivers except Jewish settlers who
live nearby from entering or leaving the city. Nablus is 40 miles
north of Jerusalem.
   Four hours after the shooting, about 60 cars were lined up
outside Nablus and an equal number were lined up inside the city
waiting to pass a roadblock manned by three jeeploads of troops.
   A United Nations vehicle, a car belonging to the Red Cross and
an Arab ambulance were turned back.
   Arab witnesses said troops rounded up dozens of Palestinians,
confiscated their identity cards and fired shots in the air.
   ``It seems the army is very angry because this is the first time
I've seen them this strict. They are shooting in the air like
crazy,'' said Nablus businessman Said Kenaan.
   Abu Islam Deedi, an Arab reporter who lives in Nablus, said
troops detained about 50 suspects and lined them up against walls.
   During questioning under the hot summer sun, the Arabs were made
to stand on one leg with their arms outstretched, said Deedi, who
said he watched the roundup from a window in his home.
   Deedi said troops also wired off streets where the shooting
occurred and erected about 10 roadblocks in the city center where
they stopped and searched Palestinian cars. He said several
busloads of troops patrolled the streets.
   According to army figures, 346 soldiers have been injured since
the uprising began, most of them by stones. The United Nations puts
the Palestinian death toll at 208. Two Israelis also have been
killed.
   Underground leaders of the uprising ordered Palestinians to
observe Thursday as a day for stockpiling food, first aid supplies
and gasoline to prolong their resistance to Israel's 21-year
occupation.
   Arabs from a bus stalled at the roadblock descended and began
throwing rocks at the settlers, who responded by hurling them back,
Israel radio and a Jewish settler said. The army fired in the air
to disperse the stone-throwers, then dismantled the roadblock.
   About 60 Jewish settlers from the West Bank settlement of Efrat,
meanwhile, used their cars to block the major Jerusalem-Hebron
highway used by thousands of Arab workers to get to their jobs in
Israel.
   The settlers said in a statement the action was to protest an
increase in Palestinian firebomb attacks. The army responded to the
stepped up attacks by orders this week to shoot firebombers.
   Also Thursday, a 17-year-old Palestinian prostitute was charged
in a Jerusalem district court with the shooting death of a Jewish
seminary student earlier this month. The charge sheet alleges
nationalistic motives.
   A military court sentenced four Palestinians convicted of
throwing firebombs. Three were sentenced to 10 years in prison for
hurling a homemade gasoline bomb at a civilian car Jan. 31 in
Jerusalem. The fourth was given eight years for throwing a firebomb
at a military jeep in Jerusalem on Feb. 26.

   The son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro was sentenced Thursday to four months
in jail for selling $25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police
officer.
   John Zaccaro Jr., 24, also was ordered to pay a $1,500 fine and
perform 300 hours of community service.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' Ferraro said, noting that other defendants in Vermont
drug cases have received lighter penalties. She said the conviction
would be appealled.
   During his sentencing hearing, Zaccaro told Vermont District
Judge Francis McCaffrey in a shaky voice that he has sworn off
drugs.
   ``I'd like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that I
will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality,'' he said.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Charles Tetzlaff, asked McCaffrey to accept
a probation officer's recommendation of a suspended sentence,
probation and community service.
   But McCaffrey told Zaccaro, ``I can't in good conscience
sentence you without any time to serve.'' Zaccaro faced a maximum
of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said he was pleased
with the sentence. He denied treating the case differently.
   ``This was a case in which we caught someone red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' Quinn said. ``I felt that it was important for
the court to say it doesn't matter who you are. If you commit a
drug offense in the state of Vermont, you'll be treated with great
severity.''
   McCaffrey suggested the jail time be served through the
Chittenden Community Correctional Center in Burlington so that
Zaccaro could participate in a special corrections program that
allows him to be kept under house arrest.
   Quinn said Zaccaro would have to be accepted into the program.
   During the sentencing, Zaccaro stood stoically beside his
father, John Zaccaro, and his mother, who was Walter Mondale's
running mate on the Democratic ticket in 1984.
   Zaccaro was arrested in February 1986 and convicted by a
District Court jury last April. He was arrested after selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to undercover agent Laura Manning while
he was attending Middlebury College, about 30 miles north of
Rutland.
   Manning testified that she went to Zaccaro's off-campus home,
where Zaccaro produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath
the living room sofa. Zaccaro was arrested that night outside the
restaurant where he worked.
   Tetzlaff argued that police used Manning as bait to snare him
during a college party weekend. The prosecution denied the charge.
   At the sentencing hearing, a tearful Ferraro had asked McCaffrey
not to treat her son differently than any other person convicted of
selling $25 worth of cocaine. She also said Zaccaro's arrest and
conviction have taken a heavy toll on her family and son.
   ``He doesn't go to church with us,'' she said. ``He doesn't want
to be seen with us. It's not because he's ashamed of us. It's
because he's ashamed of what he's done.''
   Also testifying at the sentencing hearing was the Rev. Bruce
Ritter, the founder of a New York City shelter for runaways called
Covenant House where Zaccaro works as a volunteer.
   Ritter said Zaccaro has learned his lesson.
   ``You can't try and reach these kids ... without coming into a
far better and deeper understanding of your own value system,'' he
said. ``Probably the most important things we learn are from our
mistakes. John has learned them.''
   McCaffrey also received 30 letters written on behalf of Zaccaro,
including one from his mother and one from Mondale.
   ``I saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good
friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and
strong way around our nation,'' Mondale wrote.

   A coalition of consumer groups on Thursday
gave a producer of frozen yogurt, the manufacturer of Audi
automobiles and eight other advertisers backhanded awards for
presenting the most misleading commercials.
   The fourth annual Harlan Page Hubbard Memorial Awards, named for
a 19th century advertising pioneer who promoted patent medicines as
cures for virtually all ills, were announced at a ceremony that
drew none of the winners.
   One prize went to Dannon frozen yogurt on a stick, for an ad
showing a 6-year-old girl in a swimming suit. Critics charged that
the image imposed a sexual message on little girls.
   ``We never imagined that consumers would take that message
away,'' said Dannon spokeswoman Barbara Beck, who said the ad is no
longer running. It has been replaced by commercials stressing that
the product is of interest to the whole family, she said.
   Ms. Beck said the frozen yogurt ads ran for only a few weeks
before being withdrawn. They were re-evaluated after consumers
wrote in, she said.
   The Dannon commercials were chosen for a Hubbard by the National
Women's Health Network, which said the ads encouraged the idea that
females are mainly concerned with being attractive and sexually
available.
   The awards consist of a statuette with a lemon on top, with the
consumer group that nominated the ad actually collecting the trophy.
   Joe Bennett of Audi of America, however, said he's have been
glad to send someone to get the award, if he had been informed in
advance.
   ``When you get an award like this, you just have to laugh,''
said Bennett. ``... It tells us our advertising is right on target
and we will continue to pursue it with great vigor.''
   Audi was selected for the Hubbard because of ads touting the
safety of its cars.
   These were misleading, according to the Center for Auto Safety,
because they were run at a time Audi was being investigated for
problems with the sudden acceleration of its vehicles.
   An Ohio court jury recently ruled that Audi was not at fault in
at least one case of sudden acceleration.
   Continental Airlines was cited for ads boasting that it supplies
maintenance services to other airlines. The Aviation Consumer
Action Project said this was misleading because other carriers do
maintenance for Continental as well.
   Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks respoded that ``the ad doesn't
make any claims that are not well founded.''
   The Coalition on Smoking or Health cited the tobacco industry
for ads that it said mislead consumers by suggesting that low-tar
and low-nicotine cigarettes may reduce health risks.
   Walker Merryman of the Tobacco Institute replied that the
consumer advocates overlooked the surgeon general's warnings
printed on every cigarette ad.
   ``Those warnings make several billion impressions annually, and
along with other anti-smoking information programs have certainly
given consumers adequate information. I can't think of a single
issue that people are more well informaed about than smoking and
health,'' said Merryman.
   The Beef Industry Council was mentioned for its ``real food for
real people'' ads promoting the consumption of red meat, which some
nutritionists contend can raise cholesterol levels.
   ``The leading health organizations have issued dietary
guidelines that include red meat as one of the essential
ingredients,'' responded spokesman Craig Mitchell. He charged that
the Center for Science in the Public Interest had distorted those
findings in order to get more publicity.
   Contour Chair of Philadelphia was picked for a Hubbard by the
American Association of Retired Persons. It contended that ads for
the special recliner chairs do not detail health claims and it is
hard for consumers to learn prices.
   The prices are not printed because they vary, since the chairs
are custom made, said company sales representative Robert Olin. And
as for health claims, he said, ``All the statements that we made
are verifiable.''
   Ed Aduss of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, said his
organization would have no response to its selection, although he
did observe that it has been included in the list for several years.
   The council runs ads promoting nuclear energy and stressing that
it is a viable alternative to dependence on oil and other sources.
   Hasbro Co. was cited for ads showing children playing with the
G.I. Joe Cobra Momba toy helicopter. The toy is fragile, hard to
handle and disappointing to children, the Consumer Affairs
Committee of Americans for Democratic Action contended.
   ``We respectfully disagree with their opinion,'' said Hasbro
spokesman Wayne Charness.
   Other advertising chosen for the awards included:
   _Western Union, for its ads showing people with car trouble or
other problems saved by having someone send them money. In reality,
the National Consumers League asserted, the money won't come to
you; you have to go to a Western Union office or pay a delivery
charge. Even then, the payment is usually a check, not cash, it
added.
   Western Union spokesman Warren Bechtel retorted that ``we've
never suggested in ads that someone is going to deliver money to
your house or office of something.'' The service is provided
through 11,000 outlets nationally and almost always paid in cash,
he said.
   _Cutty Sark scotch whisky, for a television ad which the Center
for Science in the Public Interest said should not have been run
because of a policy by the television networks and the spirits
industry not to advertise on TV. The Spanish-language ad ran on a
local TV station, the group said.
   ``We just dismiss this action as being typical of that group,
who have a history of trying to discredit the wine and spirits
industry,'' responded Barbara Jo Howard of Buckingham Wile Co. in
New York, which markets Cutty Sark in the United States.

   Call them big, call them hefty _ hey, call 'em
huge _ but don't say the Fat Boys, those high-calorie rappers,
drink Miller Lite beer.
   The three beefy bandmates charged in a federal lawsuit this week
that the Miller Brewing Co. intimated just that in one of its Lite
commercials _ the one where an immense Joe ``Rapping Fats'' Piscopo
raps that the ``less-filling'' brew ``tastes great.''
   The suit says Piscopo's obese appearance and rapping have left a
bad taste in the Fat Boys' mouths _ one that the comic, the beer
company and its ad agency should pay $5 million to remove.
   ``In their efforts to promote the sale of alcohol, Miller
intentionally selected and exploited the likenesses and performing
musical styles of the Fat Boys,'' the suit filed Monday charged.
   The portly plaintiffs are Mark Morales (better known as ``Prince
Markie Dee''), Damon Wimbley (aka ``Kool Rock Ski'') and Darren
Robinson (``The Human Beat Box''), along with the group's record
company and music publisher. They're asking for $5 million in
damages and withdrawal of the commercial.
   They allege the ad, which features Piscopo rolling around on a
huge bogus belly while rapping with three heavyweight partners,
takes advantage of their platinum-selling record success and
infringes on the Fat Boys trademark.
   That's right. The Fat Boys received Registration No. 1,351,054
from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for their name on July
23, 1985.
   ``The weight of the members _ their actual physical size _
combined with other elements of music, costume and performance
style constitutes an identifiable and unique characteristic of the
group,'' the lawsuit said.
   It also alleges the commercial's music, particularly the vocal
percussion of one rotund performer behind Piscopo, ``contains a
melody copied from (and) derived from'' the Fat Boys' music.
   A spokesman for the comedian, Glen Schwartz, had no immediate
comment on the suit. The ad agency, Backer & Spielvogel Inc. of
Manhattan, declined comment; a Miller spokesman was not in the
company's Wisconsin headquarters to react to the suit.

   A drought parching much of the country dropped water levels in
the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, making the waterways unnavigable
Thursday and meaning ``major-league'' losses for the inland
shipping industry.
   A seven-mile stretch of the Ohio River near Mound City, Ill.,
remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow
channel. Dozens of towboats and barges were stranded.
   Meanwhile, nearly 700 barges in the Mississippi River were tied
up north and south of the Greenville, Miss., bridge because the
river had dropped to the lowest levels since authorities began
keeping records in 1872.
   ``Everybody is concerned,'' said Chris Brinkop of the Ohio River
Ice Committee. The group comprises industry, U.S. Coast Guard and
Army Corps of Engineers officials who monitor river conditions.
   ``We've experienced tough river conditions and closures before,
but nothing this bad,'' said Brinkop. He said the industry is
losing ``major-league dollars'' because of the traffic stoppage.
   Towboat crews stranded on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers spent
their time painting, watching television, doing light maintenance
and even fishing while each towboat owner loses about $10,000 daily.
   Chuck Shumann of the Army Corps of Engineers in Louisville, Ky.,
said a 300-foot stretch of the Ohio River north of Cairo had water
levels of about eight feet _ the lowest mark there since January
1969.
   For safe passage, he said barges need at least 8.11 feet of
water.
   The Coast Guard in Paducah, Ky., closed the river. It was to
reopen Thursday night, but underground cables and debris forced a
delay until Friday afternoon.
   In the past two weeks, more than a dozen barges have gone
aground near the Mound City area, said Guard spokesman Jack Buri.
The dredge Elco was summoned to dig a 2,100-foot channel 11 feet
deep by 250 feet wide, he said.
   Low water in the Mississippi has created bottlenecks in places
like Vaucluse Landing, Ark., about three miles north of the
Greenville, Miss., bridge.
   An Army Corps of Engineers patrol boat has been escorting barges
with light loads one-by-one, and prospects for ending the
bottleneck north of Greenville brightened Thursday.
   Spokesman Michael Logue in Vicksburg, Miss., said the Corps
marked a previously unknown secondary channel at Greenville. He
said it appeared smaller towboats would be able to use it.
   ``Since we found the secondary channel, it looks like the small
tows will be able to go ahead and pass,'' Logue said. ``The larger
tows will have to wait.''
   Authorities said it would take at least a day and possibly two
to dredge a channel 16-feet to 20-feet deep that could handle
larger barges.
   On board the stranded towboats, crews made the best of it.
   ``There's plenty of work, there's always something to do,'' said
Steve Southern of Paducah, Ky., a first mate on the John M.
Donnelly on the Mississippi. ``Some people are even trying to
fish.''
   Idle barges also worried shippers like James Crafton, executive
vice president of Home Oil Co. of Henderson, Ky. He depends on
barges to deliver his petroleum products.
   ``Our last shipment was delayed about a day,'' he said. ``The
river conditions concern me. Like everyone else, I'm hoping for
some rainfall.''

   President Reagan urged Congress on Thursday to
approve full funding of science, space and technology programs
despite efforts to balance the federal budget.
   In a letter to key lawmakers, Reagan said the bipartisan budget
agreement reached by the administration and Congress in November
was designed to ``put the federal government firmly on the path
toward elimination of the budget deficit.''
   ``Achievement of that critically important objective requires
those in office to make difficult choices among competing
priorities,'' he said.
   ``We have considered the full range of federal programs and
their competing demands on scarce taxpayers' dollars and have
concluded that full funding of science, space and technology
programs must remain a top priority.''
   ``I urge the Congress to provide full funding and support for
these programs,''the president said.
   Reagan's letter was addressed to Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
and Jake Garn, R-Utah, and Reps. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., and
Bill Green, R-N.Y., the chairmen and ranking minority members,
respectively, of the Senate and and House appropriations
subcommittees that will review science and technology expenditures.

   You can't get a ticket for running a red
light in Carroll County. There are none.
   The county's last traffic signal was turned off this month when
Avenue Elementary School closed.
   There are fewer than 19,000 residents over 600 square miles in
the county in the northwest Illinois. The Missisippi River town of
Savanna, with 4,500 residents, had the last traffic light.
   ``It was green all the time unless somebody pushed the button on
it,'' Comptroller Corrine Myers said.
   The signal was installed near the school to control traffic when
children and school employees crossed the street, Superintendent
Max Pierson said.
   The county will be free of red lights through at least 1989, but
a traffic signal will be erected in Savanna when a bridge
construction project is finished.

   Donald Cooley says it was in the stars
that he should be honored as the 50 millionth person to ride the
city's public transportation system.
   His horoscope predicted he had a chance to win a contest.
   ``Do you realize what the odds are _ 50 million to one?'' Cooley
said Wednesday. ``I should be so lucky when I play the lottery.''
   On Tuesday morning, after a dispatcher alerted drivers that the
50 millionth rider was about to board a bus, drivers handed out a
registration form to the next passenger to get on or off their bus.
   Cooley's form was drawn from the 36 returned.
   Before the drawing Wednesday, Cooley said his wife, Virginia,
telephoned him at work and read the horoscope for Virgo: ``Lunar
position accents popularity, ability to persuade, valid chance to
win contest.''
   ``I got the biggest bang out of that,'' Cooley said. ``I said,
`Well, Mrs. Reagan and I, we read them.' I don't really take it too
seriously.''
   Cooley, 61, will receive a two-night vacation for four in Pigeon
Forge, Tenn., a resort area near Great Smoky Mountains National
Park, a free bus pass for a year and other prizes.

   The former chief of the Democratic Party in the
borough of Brooklyn, convicted last year of giving an illegal
gratuity to U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, was indicted Thursday on tax
fraud, conspiracy and other charges.
   Meade Esposito, 81; Harry Dickran, president of Beaumont Offset
Corp. of Farmingdale; and Phyllis Zito, Esposito's daughter and
secretary-treasurer of the company were charged in the indictment.
   Esposito was described as a silent partner in the company.
   According to the indictment, the defendants paid more than
$200,000 in bribes and kickbacks to insure that Beaumont received
profitable printing contracts.
   The defendants laundered more than $250,000 in cash through a
phony invoice scam to attain cash for the bribes and personal use,
U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said at a news conference.
   The charges cover seven years from 1971 through February.
   They are an offshoot of the investigation that led to Esposito's
conviction last September for giving an illegal gratuity to Biaggi
and interstate travel charges.
   ``While I am sympathetic to his age and frailties, there is no
way to leave him out of these charges while he is still in this
life,'' Maloney said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Hattem said Esposito attended
meetings where money laundering was discussed, mediated disputes
and ``divided up the booty.''
   In the previous case, Esposito, a powerful party boss from 1969
until his retirement in 1984, was found guilty of paying for two
vacations taken by Biaggi, a 10-term Democratic congressman from
the Bronx, and Biaggi's girlfriend.
   In return, Biaggi used his influence to lobby city and federal
officials on behalf of financially ailing Coastal Dry Dock and
Repair Inc., the second-largest client of Esposito's insurance
company, Serres Visone & Rice.
   Wiretaps played in open court showed the trips were actually
paid by Beaumont.
   Biaggi, 69, was convicted of illegally accepting gratuities but
was cleared of more serious bribery and conspiracy charges.
   Judge Jack B. Weinstein sentenced Esposito to a suspended
two-year prison term and fined him $500,000, citing Esposito's
frail health.
   He and Biaggi, who is currently on trial in federal court in
Manhattan in the Wedtech Corp. racketeering and bribery case, are
appealing the convictions.
   In the Beaumont case, each defendant is charged with six counts
of violating interstate travel laws to commit bribery, five counts
of making false statements on Beaumont's tax returns and one count
of conspiracy to make false statements on tax returns.
   Dickran and Mrs. Zito were additionally charged with three
counts of making false statements on their personal income tax
returns.
   If convicted, the defendants face up to five years in prison on
the interstate travel and conspiracy charges and three years on the
tax charges.

   The U.S. government employed convicted Nazi
war criminal Robert Jan Verbelen as an intelligence agent for 10
years after World War II to help fight communism in Austria, the
Justice Department acknowledged Thursday.
   A report released by Attorney General Edwin Meese III said
Verbelen worked with the U.S. Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps, or
CIC, and that officials accepted two different versions he gave of
his background.
   The 92-page report said Verbelen, now 77 and living in Austria,
``manipulated the CIC into protecting him from being brought to
justice for his crimes.''
   Verbelen was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death in his
native Belgium in 1947 for being primarily responsible for killing
101 people in an operation in which Belgians identified with the
resistance were ``arbitrarily selected to be arrested, beaten,
tortured, imprisoned, deported or murdered.''
   An Austrian jury in 1965 found him guilty of two wartime murders
but acquitted him on the basis that he was following order. The
decision was overturned by the Austrian Supreme Court, but the case
has not been retried. Verbelen also was accused of torturing U.S.
airmen.
   Neal Sher, director of the Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, which conducted a two-year study at the
request of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said
Verbelen accomplished his deception because of the CIC's ``practice
of utilizing Nazi criminals and their collaborators in its postwar,
Cold War European intelligence operations.''
   Verbelen served with the CIC from 1946 until December 1956 and
later worked for the Austrian State Police. He became an Austrian
citizen in 1959.
   Sher said at a news conference that the report has been given to
the Belgian and Austrian governments.
   The report said the Army intelligence group discovered
Verbelen's true identity when the CIA asked information about him.
Sher declined to say how long the CIA had known who he was or to
give any other information about the agency's involvement with
Verbelen.
   Sher said there were obvious dangers in using Nazi war criminals
because they might be blackmailed. In Verbelen's case, the CIA
didn't even know who they had hired, he said.
   Sher said the investigation was not related to any modern
intelligence-gathering efforts and was not meant to be judgmental.
But he said some conclusions ``cry out.''
   The report said the CIC followed a policy that ``the end
justifies the means.''
   The report described 13 other past U.S. agents and informants
with Nazi connections but did not name them. Sher said the Army, in
cooperating with the investigation, had demanded that they not be
identified.
   He said Justice Department investigators interviewed Verbelen
himself in the summer of 1985 and found him unrepentent. ``He
thinks he has nothing to be ashamed of,'' Sher said.
   Edward Dennis, head of the Justice Department's criminal
division, said the investigation was done as thoroughly as
possible, ''regardless of who that will embarrass or make
uncomfortable.''
   The report said no U.S. government agency made any effort to
apprise Belgian authorities of Verbelen's whereabouts when his true
identity was uncovered.
   It said that even when the U.S. agency dismissed Verbelen, after
it discovered his Nazi war record in 1956, it did so ``without
prejudice'' and classified him as ``suitable for intelligence
re-employment.''
   The report said the CIC apparently relied entirely on the
information Verbelen gave about himself, including the name he
gave, Peter Mayer. In 1950, he informed the agency his name was
really Herbert Schwab, describing himself as a devoted Nazi Party
member since the mid-1930s and a member of a Nazi security unit
that was declared a criminal organization after the war, the report
said.
   ``Despite this change in identity and life history, the (CIC)
made no attempt to verify the information Verbelen supplied about
himself, and it continued to employ him,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Jackson Asks Senators to Be Fair, Gets Backing From One</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Democrat Jesse Jackson made a pitch to a
roomful of senators Thursday to ``be fair'' in delegate selection,
but afterward his total remained at one senator supporting him for
president.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, from Jackson's home state of South
Carolina, said that as a ``super delegate'' he will vote for
Jackson at the Democratic convention this summer because Jackson
won his state. Jackson deserves his vote, he said, even thouigh
Michael Dukakis is ``the obvious winner'' of the presidential
contest.
   Hollings, who made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in
1984, said Jackson's campaign this year is far different from four
years ago.
   ``This time he's run a winning campaign. He hasn't frightened
anyone. He's charmed them in all of those different debates and in
his own right has leveled off, and really, you're looking at Jesse
Jackson not as a black but really for his own philosophy with
respect to hunger and nutrition and jobs and drugs and everything
else,'' Hollings said.
   Although Dukakis is certain to get the nomination, said
Hollings, ``for the good of the party, we also ought to be
supporting Rev. Jackson.''
   None of the others among 33 Democrats who met at Jackson's
request in the Capitol jumped to join Hollings in backing Jackson,
although they listened with interest to the candidate's appeal for
support, said Jackson press secretary Delmarie Cobb.
   Jackson made a case, according to those present, that he should
get the convention votes of ``super delegates'' in whose states and
districts he won the popular vote. Super delegates are Democrats
who will have votes at the convention by virtue of their elected or
party leadership positions.
   Later Jackson told reporters that the Democratic leadership,
``while accepting my investment in the party to make it strong, has
not been as reciprocal as it ought to be.''
   ``The people have spoken and now leadership should catch up with
the people,'' he said.
   ``If in fact I have injected nothing in the party, I should
expect no return. If I invest I should reasonably expect return,''
he told reporters. ``So I appreciate the accolades that I am the
voter registration champion for the party, that I have led the
drive to return the Senate back to the Democrats, that I have won
states that no one said I could win.''
   However, he added, ``If I have done all of that, I simply say
let's be fair.''
   He was praised earlier Thursday by members of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, before whom he testified on drug
abuse prevention and treatment.
   Jackson, who has made the drug issue a centerpiece of his
presidential campaign, told the committee that U.S. military forces
should not be used as the primary interdiction force, but rather
should be used for backing up other agencies and providing
intelligence.
   ``We must be careful, however, to avoid involving the military
in any police actions agianst citizens or arrests,'' he said. ``We
should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any other
aspect of foreign policy.''
   Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and the other
senators thanked Jackson for his years as an outspoken leader
against drugs and for his work with young people.
   Later Kennedy joined Jackson at a rally outside the Capitol
denouncing South Africa as a terrorist state. Jackson urged support
for anti-apartheid legislation.

   Texas farmers burned the thorns off cactus to provide emergency
cattle feed in a drought called the worst in a half-century, while
growers in the Midwest bemoaned Thursday's scattered showers as
little more than tantalizing.
   ``It's going to help a few farmers, but for most farmers it's
too little too late,'' said Dan Bowman, a meteorologist for
WeatherData in Wichita, after some Kansas communities got more than
2 inches of rain and Joplin, Mo., got 1{ inches Thursday morning.
   Drought has plagued the nation's midsection, where it's as dry
as it's been since the Dust Bowl, and the Southeast, forcing
farmers to sell off cattle they can't afford to feed and to plow
under shriveled crops. The June shortfall of rainfollows a dry
winter and a parched spring.
   Thursday's showers, said Herb Kinnear of the Indiana Farm
Bureau, were ``just enough to settle the dust. But it's keeping the
sun from shining and baking things. That's one consolation.''
   Another consolation was an additional $10 million in emergency
state loans for up to 45,000 Hoosier farmers.
   Elsewhere, barges along the Mississippi were stranded at
low-water bottlenecks, fires were on the rise in Missouri and
Georgia, and ginseng growers in Wisconsin were discovering that
even they were suffering, although the exotic root thrives on arid
soil.
   In Washington, President Reagan appointed an interagency
committee to deal with the widespread drought.
   Texas ranchers in the Lower Rio Grande Valley are using propane
burners to remove thorns from prickly pear cactus to allow cattle
to graze on the water-retaining plants, said Kraig Gallimore of the
Texas Department of Agriculture's farmer assistance program.
   However, the drought has struck so deep in some areas that
ranchers have stopped the practice because even cactus is
shriveling, he said.
   In North Dakota, which the U.S. Agriculture Department said was
hit hardest, an agricultural economist predicted losses from three
major crops could total $2.7 billion this year.
   The estimate accounts for losses in federal deficiency payments
and turnover of the money in the economy, but not ``for the losses
we'll likely have on crops other than wheat, barley and oats,''
said Arlen Leholm, an economist with North Dakota State University.
   Bill Lytle, a South Dakota climatologist, said the state
normally gets 3-4 inches of rain in June and this year has only
received 0.3 inches so far for the month.
   ``It's worse than '76. I think it goes back to '34,'' said
Lytle, who blamed the drought on a large high-pressure ridge that
is diverting low-pressure storm systems north into Canada. Because
the system covers most of the nation's midsection, it's likely to
persist for some time, he said.
   Firmin Rettinghauf, 72, whose three sons farm his land near
Gilbertville in northeast Iowa, walked through his parched fields
and proclaimed: ``There ain't gonna be no crops. It's the worst
I've seen since '36.''
   In southwest Iowa, cattle farmers continued selling off herds as
pastures baked in the sun and feed prices skyrocketed.
   ``The man in the cow business is having to sell his factory, is
what it amounts to,'' said Gary Schwab, whose Lamoni Livestock
Sales barn is reporting cattle sales 50 percent higher than a year
ago. ``I'd rather take a beating than talk to a man about selling
his herd.''
   Two convenience store owners in Walford, Iowa, decided that if
farmers were going to take a loss, they would, too.
   The owners said their sign advertising ``Ice cream cones, 25
cents, until it rains'' will stay up until the area gets a
drenching. Cones normally sell for 40 cents.
   Dropping water levels in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers made
the waterways unnavigable Thursday, hurting the inland shipping
industry.
   A seven-mile stretch of the Ohio River near Mound City, Ill.,
remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow
channel. Dozens of towboats and barges were stranded.
   Meanwhile, nearly 700 barges in the Mississippi River were tied
up north and south of the Greenville, Miss., bridge because the
river had dropped to the lowest levels since authorities began
keeping records in 1872.
   Georgia and Missouri reported an increase in forest fires due to
abnormally dry conditions.
   Hundreds of fires have broken out in the parched Ozark hills in
recent months, and Missouri officials say it is the worst fire year
since the 1940s for the Mark Twain National Forest.
   The forest has seen 260 fires blacken 13,600 acres so far this
year, said Bob Willis, of the U.S. Forest Service office in Rolla.
In an average year, 5,000 to 6,000 acres are burned, he said.
   More than 3,200 acres of Georgia forest land have been damaged
so far in June, exceeding a five-year average for the entire month,
said Bob Burns, a member of the fire control staff at Forestry
Commission Headquarters in Macon.
   Wisconsin ginseng growers, normally plagued by excess moisture,
said even they were thinking about irrigation.
   ``It's good news to be dry but it's no good to be a desert,''
said Lyn Heise, 51, who grows about 10 acres of the medicinal root
near Wausau. ``We like it much drier than the regular farmers who
grow corn or soybeans, but even for us it's going too long.''

   Southern Baptists charged modern
society with an ``erosion of moral sanity'' Thursday and condemned
homosexuality as ``an abomination in the eyes of God.''
   ``This deviant behavior has wrought havoc in the lives of
millions,'' said assembled ``messengers'' of the 14.7
million-member denomination.
   On the last day of the convention, it adopted one of the most
unqualified denunciations of homosexuality in recent major church
annals.
   ``The Bible is very clear in its teaching that homosexuality is
a manifestation of a depraved nature,'' the convention said, adding:
   ``Homosexuality is a perversion of divine standards and a
violation of nature and of natural affections.''
   The resolution said, ``Homosexuals are justified and even
glorified in our secular media.''
   With fundamentalists prevailing over moderates in this
factionally divided gathering of 35,600 people, the meeting also
whipped through a score of other resolutions. Among them, the
convention:
   _ Voiced ``outrage over the firing of a competent, highly
professional Christian,'' Dennis Shere, as publisher of the Dayton
(Ohio) Daily News By Cox Newspapers for refusing to carry gay and
lesbian advertising.
   _ Rejected an amendment that would have pledged the
denomination's institutions not to fire or replace anyone for
disagreeing with its policies, such as those recently demanding
biblical literalism.
   _ Condemned provision of birth control information and devices
at public school clinics, saying it undermined parental authority,
fomented promiscuity and abdicated moral responsibility of schools.
   _ Declared family and biblical values ``under constant attack
from materialism, secular humanism, substance abuse and rebellion
against authority.''
   _ Questioned aspects of the Civil Rights Restoration Act, saying
it should be modified to protect religious liberty, assuring
exemption of institutions indirectly controlled by religion, as
well as those directly religious.
   Brad Corrigan, a Dallas layman, urged the resolution criticizing
the Cox newspaper publisher's firing, and for consistency also
pushed for adoption of a policy allowing dissent by the
denomination's employees.
   Instead, he said, he had been ``outvoted, outhustled and
outfoxed'' by fundamentalists and likened to a ``polecat'' with
other moderates at a convention which declared laymen couldn't
disagree with elected leaders.
   ``I for one do not believe it,'' he said.
   In the resolution on homosexuality, gay people were termed the
primary cause for the spread of AIDS, saying it not only has
affected them ``but also innocent victims.''
   Homosexuals, ``like all sinners, can receive forgiveness and
victory through personal faith in Jesus Christ,'' the resolution
said, adding:
   ``(While) God loves the homosexual and offers salvation,
homosexuality is not a normal life style and is an abomination in
the eyes of God.''

   The Pentagon notified Congress on Thursday it
had approved a sale of F-16 jet fighters to Bahrain and artillery
radar units to Pakistan.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said it planned to sell four new F-16 fighters and associated spare
parts to Bahrain for about $90 million.
   Bahrain had previously purchased 12 of the fighters ``and
therefore will have no difficulty absorbing these same model
aircraft into its armed forces,'' the Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon said the U.S. Air Force would oversee the
transaction with Bahrain and the General Dynamics Corp. would serve
as the prime contractor.
   As for Pakistan, the Pentagon said it planned to sell that
country five Firefinder radar sets, which are used to fix the
locations of enemy artillery and mortars. That deal is worth an
estimated $31 million.
   The U.S. Army will oversee the transaction and the Hughes
Aircraft Corp. of Fullerton, Calif., will serve as the prime
contractor.

   A Colombian woman whose 7-year-old daughter
brought a lump of cocaine to school in her backpack this week was
arrested on a federal warrant Thursday when she came to court to
regain custody of her children.
   Maria Cristina Torres was arrested by a U.S. marshal when she
appeared in Commissioner Jack Gold's court, where she sought the
return of the girl and her 5-year-old son.
   The daughter and eight classmates at Canoga Park Lutheran School
tasted the lump of cocaine on Monday but none suffered any lasting
ill effects.
   The no-bail warrant was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge
A. Andrew Hauk after Ms. Torres was found to be on probation in
another case in which she tried to carry thousands of dollars out
of the country without reporting it.
   Ms. Torres, 39, was arrested Monday for investigation of child
endangerment and released on $100,000 bail. She was freed before
her probationary status was discovered.
   Ms. Torres was arrested March 18, 1985, when she tried to take
$146,257 in cash aboard a Canada-bound flight. She told inspectors
she was carrying $3,000. Cash over $5,000 must be reported.
   She pleaded guilty to failing to report currency and giving a
false statement to a government agency. On June 17, 1985, she was
placed on five years' probation.

<HEAD>Estonian Party Leader Is Replaced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief in strongly
nationalistic Estonia was relieved of his job Thursday and replaced
by the current Soviet ambassador to Nicaragua, Vajno I. Vaelaes,
the Tass news agency said.
   It was not clear from the brief Tass dispatch whether Karl G.
Vayno's departure came because of a fall from political favor.
   Vayno's leaving marked the third change in republic-level party
leaders in less than a month. On May 21, the party chiefs in
Armenia and Azerbaijan were replaced as the simmering territorial
dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region continued.
   Vayno, 65, had been party boss in the Soviet republic on the
Baltic Sea since July 1978. Tass said his departure was approved at
a meeting Thursday of the Estonian party's Central Committee.
   Under Vayno's guidance, Estonia became a testing ground for many
of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reform policies.
   However, Vayno's leadership came under strong criticism at an
April meeting of Estonian writers, filmmakers and other cultural
workers, who complained of ecological problems, corruption and the
functionings of Estonia's government.
   Estonian nationalism has been strong since the formerly
independent Baltic land was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet
Union in 1940. This nationalism continued during Vayno's tenure in
the Switzerland-sized jurisdiction.
   Tass said Vanjo was relieved ``in connection with a transfer
under the jurisdiction'' of the Moscow-based Central Committee, the
party's policy-making body. The Committee could assign him to a job
in Moscow or elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
   His replacement, Vaelaes, 57, served earlier as a secretary of
the Estonian party.
   In a separate biographical note, Tass indicated the choice of
Vaelaes was not unanimous, saying he received ``the majority of the
votes'' from Estonia's Central Committee. Such decisions are
usually unanimous.
   Vaelaes began his political career in Tartu, Estonia, where he
was elected head of the city's Komsomol _ young Communist league _
after graduating from Tartu University, Tass said.
   He went on to lead the party organization in Tallinn, Estonia's
capital, for 10 years, and then was elected a party secretary for
the republic-wide party apparatus.
   He joined the diplomatic corps in 1980, and served as Soviet
ambassador to Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago and Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Laws Preserving AIDS Confidentiality Limited, Professor Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laws protecting confidentiality for AIDS patients
are less effective than those aimed at preventing discrimination in
areas such as jobs and housing, a law professor writes in a leading
medical publication.
   When it comes to AIDS infection, legal protection of medical
confidence is often an illusion, said Professor Bernard M. Dickens
of the University of Toronto in Ontario.
   ``While some laws appear to require and provide secrecy of
medical data, others compel disclosures,'' he wrote in Friday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   He cited examples in non-AIDS cases in which courts have ruled
that public policies favoring confidentiality must yield when it is
necessary to prevent danger to others.
   ``The protection privilege ends where the public peril begins,''
he said, quoting a California Supreme Court decision concerning the
appropriateness of warning a person believed to be in danger of
attack from a mental health patient.
   In general, high legal principles exist to justify the breaking
of some medical confidences, regardless of laws to preserve those
confidences, Dickens wrote.
   An example, he said, would be a spouse's right to know if her
mate is infected with the AIDS virus, because the information
pertains to a risk to her life, he wrote.
   If potential victims can't be identified, disclosing the names
of people with AIDS-related conditions to health authorities might
be legally justifiable even if it isn't specifically required by
law, according to the article.
   Currently, all 50 states require that diagnoses of AIDS be
reported to health authorities, he said. Some states require the
names of people diagnosed with the disease be reported. A number of
states mandate reporting of every laboratory test that indicates
infection is present, Dickens said.
   AIDS, a fatal and incurable viral illness, is believed to be
passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles
and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.
   The disease has struck more than 64,000 people in this country
since 1979 and killed more than 36,000 of them, according to the
national Centers for Disease Control.
   Laboratory tests for AIDS infection do not indicate whether a
person has the disease, but only if the virus that causes it has
entered his system. It can be years between infection and the
appearance of symptoms.
   Dickens said that rather than beefing up laws protecting
confidentiality, it makes more sense to reinforce laws prohibiting
discrimination against people with AIDS, with related conditions or
people suspected of being infected.
   He praised a proposal in Congress aimed mainly at curbing
discrimination in areas such as housing, employment, education,
insurance and access to medical care.
   The measure, an amendment to the federal Public Health Service
Act, does not omit guidelines to protect confidentiality, but
couples them with anti-discrimination provisions, he wrote.
   Leonard Graff, legal director for National Gay Rights Advocates
in San Francisco, agreed.
   ``Our position has been is that it is important to have
confidentiality and anti-discrimination laws working in tandem to
protect individuals,'' he said by telephone Thursday. ``And we know
that this works.''

   First-degree murder trials are on hold
until the Florida Supreme Court can decide if the Duval County
grand jury is legal.
   Defense attorneys claim the jury has too many members, making it
easier for prosecutors to win an indictment.
   The high court granted a stay in a murder trial scheduled to
begin next week, causing the postponement of all trials in which
the defendants were indicted.
   Chief Assistant State Attorney John Delaney said Wednesday the
ruling means none of the 17 first-degree murder cases in Duval
County will be able to go to trial.
   But Delaney said the current grand jury will keep indicting
people for first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life in
prison or death in the electric chair.
   The high court ruling came Tuesday in the case of John D.
Freeman, a Jacksonville man already convicted and sentenced to
death in one slaying, and to go on trial Monday on a second
first-degree murder charge.
   His attorneys, Assistant Public Defenders Jim Miller and Patrick
McGuinness, argued the case should be postponed until the grand
jury issue is resolved.
   They claim Florida laws require a maximum of 18 grand jurors be
impaneled at one time. Duval County's grand jury has 23 members.
They claim because it only takes 12 members to vote for an
indictment, it is easier to get 12 of 23 jurors than 12 of 18.
   Prosecutors, however, claim the Legislature gives larger
counties the right to impanel up to 23 jurors and their position
was upheld by Chief Circuit Judge John Santora Jr.
   The public defenders appealed to the state Supreme Court.
   Delaney said it could be three months before the justices rule.
   If the high court rules that Duval County was incorrect, Delaney
said a new grand jury can be impaneled and the defendants
re-indicted.
   The only possibility of serious problems, he said, would be if
the high court voided past convictions. The county has been using
23 grand jurors since 1970.

<HEAD>New Pay Plan Would Bar Legislators From Keeping Honoraria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior House Democrat on Thursday proposed a
new congressional salary system that would prohibit lawmakers from
keeping honoraria earned from making speeches and writing articles.
   Under the legislation, members would select their own salaries
in a range from the current level of $89,500 up to as much as
$135,000, the amount recommended by a presidential pay commission.
   The proposal by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, came two days after the House
voted to reject a 4 percent cost-of-living increase for next year.
   ``In being shy about declaring our worth in an honest way, all
we do is demean our office and reinforce the public misimpression
about public service,'' Rostenkowski said in a statement.
   He said that while he defends the current system, which lets
House members accept up to $2,000 per speech up to an annual limit
of 30 percent of their congressional salaries, ``we are well
advised to guard against even the appearance of a conflict of
interest.''
   Rostenkowski is consistently one of the top honoraria-earners in
Congress.
   His proposal would permit lawmakers to choose a salary up to the
last amount recommended by the presidential commission.
   ``Those members with more responsibility or longer tenure would
be free to make a statement of their worth to their constituents
openly and honestly by signing in at the high end of the scale,''
he said.
   The current limit of $3,000 in business-related living expense
tax deductions also would be lifted under Rostenkowski's proposal,
allowing members of Congress to deduct as much as they could
justify to the Internal Revenue Service.

<HEAD>Little Leaguers Quitting After Parents Play Basebrawl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Little Leaguers who just wanted
to play ball are quitting after watching their parents brawl and
their coaches threaten to sue each other.
   A smoldering dispute flared into a 20-minute brawl last week
after a championship game, and police were called to break it up.
   ``It's just a bunch of mad parents acting like fools,'' said
Ginger Metcalf, who has three sons on one of the teams.
   Lucille King called the situation unbelievable and said her
12-year-old son Marty has decided to quit the league.
   ``It got to a point where he couldn't even play anymore because
the parents were fighting,'' Mrs. King said. ``They were fighting
with the coaches, the board members were fighting, every game we
had they'd always come up with a different rule.''
   No matter which side the parents take in the controversy, they
agree the infighting is hurting the kids and tarnishing the
league's reputation.
   Fighting erupted Thursday when the A's beat the Mets by a run to
claim the championship.
   A's Coach Reed McMillan said Mets' Coach Steve Isaacs attacked
his son after the game, grabbing him by the neck and shaking him.
   McMillan said he got so angry he tackled Isaacs, and other
parents jumped in.
   Isaacs indicated he was only trying to head off a fight between
the kids. He said his son, Jason, and McMillan's son, Dwane, were
arguing, so he grabbed Dwane by the shirt. Then McMillan pounced on
him from behind, he said.
   Both coaches retained lawyers and are considering suits.
   McMillan and some other parents claim the league is not being
run by Little League rules and was dominated by President Karl
Cummings who made his own rules and changed them frequently.
   But Isaacs says the problem is McMillan.
   Cummings and parents supporting Isaacs maintain the problems
began when McMillan started coaching this year.
   ``Things were more touchy. Things were more on edge,'' said
Cummings. He called McMillan ``a very competitive type person. I
believed we lost the joy toward the children, and I believe a lot
of parents picked up on that.''

<HEAD>Pacific Islands Representatives Seek Federal Aid to Combat Drug
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of U.S. territories told a
congressional panel Thursday that they have increasing drug
problems, and need the additional federal aid included in pending
legislation.
   The bill, introduced by Rep. Don de Lugo, D-Virgin Islands,
would provide training, equipment and money for American Samoa,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and Palau.
   De Lugo, who presided at the hearing as chairman of the House
Interior subcommittee on insular and international affairs, said he
expected the legislation to become part of a planned comprehensive
drug bill this year.
   The legislation would provide $11.5 million in assistance in the
first year, and $5.5 million annually in subsequent years.
   Gov. Alexander A. Farrelly of the Virgin Islands said his
territory has become a major transit point for drugs moving from
South America to the U.S. mainland.
   But the governor and Iver Stridiron, president of the Virgin
Islands legislature, said significant amounts of the drugs remain
in the territory and are causing a large increase in violent crimes.
   ``It really has our community under siege,'' Stridiron said. But
he added that with additional resources, the island territory could
become a model of combatting the drug problem in U.S. territories.
   Farrelly said his major problem is resources, commenting that
the assignment of a single Drug Enforcement Administration agent in
the islands indicates either ``non-recognition of a serious
problem'' or lack of interest in solving it.
   Gov. Joseph F. Ada of Guam said his territory is experiencing a
resurgence of heroin abuse after cleaning up the problem following
the Vietnam War.
   ``In 1985, there was not one single case of heroin possession in
the territory of Guam,'' he testified. ``In 1986, 12 heroin arrests
were made by our police department.
   ``In 1987, there were 108 cases of heroin possession, with 56
still pending laboratory analysis and confirmation. By any
definition, this is an alarming rise,'' Ada said.
   The governor said 91 percent pure heroin from Southeast Asia has
been entering Guam through Palau. But after law enforcement
officers discovered the route, the drugs began coming to Guam via
the Northern Marianas, he said.
   Asked by de Lugo if he could put a cost on Guam's drug problem,
Ada said the law enforcement price tag could be $2 million to $3
million, but added the real cost could only be measured in trauma
and shattered lives _ not dollars.
   Responding to a question by Rep. Fofo I.F. Sunia, D-American
Samoa, Ada said he would fire anyone in his administration abusing
drugs with ``no questions asked.''
   A written statement submitted by American Samoa Gov. A.P. Lutali
said the ``most pervasive and growing illegal substance abuse
problem'' in his territory is marijuana, followed by cocaine.
   Referring to the marijuana problem, Lutali's statement said,
``What 10 years ago was a situation involving a relatively small
number of individuals importing the drug through the U.S. mail has
now become a cultivation enterprises market by extended families
producing in excess of seven tons per year.''

<HEAD>Shultz Says U.S. Won't Pay Philippines Rent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Thursday the United States would not get dragged into ``bidding
wars'' for the right to locate American military bases in the
Philippines or anywhere else in the world.
   Asked by Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, whether the United States
should get into ``bidding wars'' for such bases, Shultz told the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations that ``the
concept of rent for bases we have to reject. When we have a base,
it must because it is in the interests of both'' countries.
   Specifically, in the negotiations for extending the leases on
the Clark air base and Subic naval base, ``there are those in the
Philippines who think it is a great asset and they would rent it
out at a staggering sum of money,'' Shultz said.
   ``We've told them we reject that and will go elsewhere. We will
stick to our position, and if we have to find other places for our
ships and planes, we'll do it,'' he added.
   Negotiations are under way between the two countries to renew
the five-year base leases that expire in 1991. Some Filipino
officials have suggested the United States pay more than $1 billion
a year over the current $180 million attached to annual aid for the
two bases.
   Regarding a law under consideration by the Philippine congress
that would ban U.S. nuclear weapons, Shultz said ``nuclear
deterrence is an esential ingredient in keeping the peace.''
   If a host country says U.S. ships are not welcome because they
may be carrying nuclear weapons, ``then we have to part company,''
he said.
   ``Nuclear weapons make some people nervous,'' Shultz said. ``But
they'd be even more nervous if the other side had them and we
didn't.''
   The law has passed the Philippine Senate but is expected to face
opposition in the Philippine House.
   On another issue, Inouye said his committee had received letters
from the Philippines charging that human rights violations there
had increased and that vigilante groups are getting official
government support.
   Shultz replied that he was aware of the proliferaiton of
vigilantes and said the development ``has pluses but also minuses.''
   ``President (Corazon) Aquino has increasingly recognized that
the communist insurgency has to be dealt with with great severity
and firmness. ... So the tendency is to reach out and find
additional strength'' outside the military, he said.
   But Shultz cautioned that ``this is a development everyone must
be weary of.''

   Three Atlanta hotels, concerned that they have
not received names or deposits for rooms reserved for people
attending the Democratic National Convention next month, are
raising the possibility they'll sell the rooms to other customers.
   While none has sold all its reserved rooms for the July 18-21
convention, ``some are contemplating selling their rooms and
function space,'' said Robert King, president of the Georgia
Hospitality & Travel Association. ``They are concerned that they
are not getting the names and they are not getting the money. They
are getting worried.''
   ``I get the feeling they are not organized,'' King said of the
Democratic National Convention Committee and Atlanta '88, the local
organizing committee. ``I was hoping as we got closer to the time
of the convention that things would fall into place.''
   Democraticofficials said they have not provided complete guest
lists to the hotels because some delegates have not been chosen and
some news organizations have not provided the names of their
convention staffs.
   Nearly 19,000 rooms in 107 area hotels have been committed for
the convention.

<TEXT>
   Congress should block Reagan administration
plans to sell a sophisticated ship defense system to Japan because
the sale would jeopardize both U.S. security and the future of the
American shipbuilding industry, the author of the proposed ban said
Thursday.
   The administration ``is unable to guarantee that the Aegis
system would be protected from compromise through espionage once it
has left the direct control of the U.S. Navy,'' Rep. Charles E.
Bennett, D-Fla., told the House Foreign Affairs arms control and
Asia-Pacific subcommittees.
   Congress was formally notified June 6 the administration had
approved the sale of one Aegis system costing $526 million during
the current fiscal year, with promise of a second system next year
and more purchases in the 1990s.
   Aegis is the U.S. Navy's latest integrated shipboard air defense
system, designed to track, select and fire on multiple incoming
targets.
   Senior Defense and State department officials staunchly defended
the proposed sale at the hearing, arguing that blocking it would
damage U.S. credibility and cooperation with Japan on vital defense
strategy in the Western Pacific.
   ``I can think of no single action on our part which would do
more to call into question the basic aims or our security policy in
the Pacific region than to say that we have decided not to proceed
weith the Aegis sale to Japan,'' said Assistant Secretary of State
Gaston Sigur.
   Sigur termed the sale ``critical in enabling Japan to fully
assume'' the role of defending its home region in the joint
U.S.-Japanese plan for security in the Western Pacific. ``To deny
this sale would undercut our policy of encouraging enhanced
Japanese military spending,'' he said.
   Bennett said Aegis-equipped U.S. warships remaining under
American command should perform the missions planned by the
Japanese.
   Assistant Defense Secretary Richard Armitage said Japan has
repeatedly rejected, as recently as last week, demands of some
members of Congress that its future Aegis-equipped destroyers be
American-made.
   Had the administration insisted on this, he said, ``we would
have succeeded only in killing Aegis as a Japanese option ... it
would not be politically feasible in Japan for approval of
procurement of an Aegis ship if the hull were built in the United
States.''
   But Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., said she has inside information
that ``Japan wants the Aegis system so badly that she will take it
any way she can get it _ even to the point of buying the whole
package from the U.S.''
   Ms. Bentley, a former chairwoman of the U.S. Maritime
Commission, charged that the Japanese and other foreign
shipbuilders want to destroy the American shipbuilding industry,
now suffering from dwindling orders.
   Accusing the State Department of ignoring ``the rough-and-tumble
world of profit and loss,'' Ms. Bentley said proposals such as the
Aegis sale could lead to a situation where ``within 10 years we
will have to buy our warships from them (Japan) because we will not
have the capability of building them ourselves any more ....''
   She and Bennett also suggested that through a process of
``reverse engineering,'' Japanese purchasers could learn the Aegis
technology once the system was transferred.
   Sigur and Armitage said the Japanese government, as opposed to
private companies, had an impeccable record of safeguarding
sensitive U.S. technology.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee
said Thursday it will ask the Internal Revenue Service and the
Federal Election Commission to investigate a Chicago-based group
for allegedly illegal campaign contributions.
   Nearly all the contributions from Citizen Action went to Senate
or House candidates. But at the top of the committee's list was the
Dukakis for President Committee.
   Steve Akey, spokesman for Michael Dukakis said, however, that
the campaign's financial records showed no contribution from
Citizen Action.
   The allegations were denied by a top official of Citizen Action,
who claimed the allegations are ``filled with outright falsehoods
and clever distortions.''
   The GOP committee alleged at a news conference that Citizen
Action and its affiliates in 24 states formed corporations with
tax-exempt status that went beyond their legal bounds of promoting
issues solely among members. Instead, the committee said, Citizen
Action and its affiliates used donations to make a pitch for
particular political candidates to members and the general public.
   In addition, the committee charged, Citizen Action did not
report its activities on behalf of candidates as independent
expenditures or direct contributions to the candidates.
   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., who spoke at the news conference,
said the senatorial committee is charging that while Citizen Action
enjoys preferential tax-exempt status from the IRS, it is ``heavily
involved in political activities that are completely inconsistent
with its tax-exempt status.''
   Kasten, who said affiliates of Citizen Action worked against him
in his 1986 re-election bid, also contended that it is improper to
call the group a citizens group because it is ``not volunteer, with
ordinary citizens participating in democracy. These are paid,
organized workers.''
   Kasten described Citizen Action's efforts as ``a national
conspiracy of radical political groups'' and said the groups ``are
guilty of massive federal election and tax law violations.''
   In a statement, Robert Brandon, vice president of Citizen
Action, said the allegations by the Republican committee ``are
filled with outright falsehoods and clever distortions.'' And in
comments immediately after the committee's news conference, Brandon
said that the financial records of Citizen Action and its
affiliates are audited regularly by the IRS
   ``What we do is no different from what thousands of other groups
legitimately do _ trying to win meaningful changes on issues of
concern to their members,'' he said, citing as examples the
National Rifle Association and the Sierra Club.
   Specifically, the committee charges that affiliates of the 1.75
million-member Citizen Action are incorporated as either social
welfare or charitable organizations under the Internal Revenue
Code. Both types of organizations are tax exempt. However, the code
stipulates that charitable organizations cannot be involved in
politics, while social welfare organizations are allowed to engage
in partisan politics, but only among members, the committee said.
   Jann L. Olsten, executive director of the GOP committee, alleged
that members of Citizen Action go door to door, speaking about
issues and in the process ``deliver partisan messages on behalf of
or against a candidate.'' At the same time, Olsten said, canvassers
will ask for a financial contribution.
   ``Money is being given to tax-exempt organizations and it is
being used for partisan political campaigns,'' Olsten said.
   Kasten added, ``These people are not supposed to be primarily
involved in the elections process, but this is a significant
election effort.''
   Olsten said that the committee is asking the IRS to withdraw
Citizen Action's tax-exempt status.

<HEAD>NRC Called Slow To Respond To Substandard Bolt Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was
criticized Thursday for failing to rid nuclear power plants of
substandard nuts, bolts and other fasteners since the problem was
discovered in 1982.
   ``The NRC has dragged its feet and boggled the whole question,''
said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``You have had since 1982 to think
about this problem and it is now 1988 and you are still thinking
about it.''
   Wyden's comments came at a hearing of the House Energy and
Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee during which NRC
officials estimated that up to 20 percent of the fasteners in the
nation's nuclear plants may fail to meet specifications.
   ``We expect standards we require for nuclear plants will be
met,'' said Victor Stello, the NRC's executive director for
operations. ``They have not been met. We are not happy.''
   Stello said the NRC was ``not satisfied'' that nuclear power
plant operators had done enough to eliminate substandard bolts and
that the commission was studying ways to ensure compliance,
including barring the use of bolts supplied by manufacturers with a
history of problems.
   The NRC plans to move ``agressively'' against manufacturers who
supply counterfeit fasteners or fraudulently claim their products
meet specifications, Stello said.
   He said the extent of the problem was just now becoming clear.
   In addition, Stello said he would attempt to convene a meeting
involving other federal agencies that also have faced problems
eliminating the use of substandard fasteners in facilities they
oversee.

<TEXT>
   Former Defense Minister V. P. Singh, a
political foe of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, tested his popularity
with voters Thursday by running for Parliament, but the special
elections were marred by violence.
   Six people were injured in clashes in the Allahabad
constituency, where Singh ran on an anti-corruption platform, and
voting was postponed because of ballot-stuffing in one village,
authorities said.
   In another election district, a man was shot and killed and 10
people were injured.
   The contest between Singh, 56, and singer and film writer Sunil
Shastri, 38, of the Gandhi's governing Congress Party, has been
closely watched as a barometer of how Singh would fare against
Gandhi in a national election.
   Election results were not expected before Saturday in the
Singh-Shastri contest.
   The worst violence reported was in Palwal village in the
Faridabad constituency, about 18 miles south of New Delhi, when men
with guns, knives and sticks tried to storm a Congress Party
office, according to dispatches from the United News of India and
the Press Trust of India. It was there that the shooting death
occurred.
   The Allahabad voting was one of seven special elections held
Thursday to fill vacancies in the 544-seat lower house of
Parliament. Elections for all Parliament seats, which will
determine India's next prime minister, must be held no later than
January 1990.
   Singh, a former ally of Gandhi, broke with him last year over
what he saw as government footdragging over investigating alleged
kickbacks in defense contracts.
   Singh ran as an independent with the backing of several
opposition parties against Shastri, son of the late Prime Minister
Lal Bahadur Shastri.
   Voting in Satpura village in Allahabad constituency was
postponed until Friday after unidentified men seized the ballots
and started filling them out, the constituency's top election
official, P.C. Chaturvedi, said.
   Ballot-counting in the entire constituency cannot start until
the Satpura situation is resolved, he said.
   Chaturvedi also said at least six people were hurt when rival
groups of political workers clashed near Naini, 10 miles south of
Allahabad.
   Arun Nehru, a onetime Gandhi ally and former minister of state
for home affairs, who now supports Singh, told a news conference
the Satpura ballot-stuffing was engineered by Congress Party
members.
   ``It was a planned and systematic attempt to rig votes,'' Nehru
said.
   Nehru also said that V..P. Singh's nephew, Vikram Singh, was
shot at and injured by Congress supporters at Manda, 25 miles
southwest of Allahabad. The report could not be confirmed.
   At another news conference, Congress General Secretary Ghulam
Nabi Azad denied Nehru's charges and accused the opposition of
``intimidation and terror tactics.''
   V.P. Singh was an early voter in Allahabad, 360 miles southeast
of New Delhi.
   An estimated 45 percent of the 850,000 eligible voters took part
in the Allahabad election, state governemnt spokesman P.K. Asthana
said.

   The government admitted
Thursday that a security lapse allowed Irish guerrillas to kill six
British soldiers by planting a bomb on their van while they were
running in a charity race.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility and vowed ``to
wage unceasing war'' against British forces in Northern Ireland.
   Townspeople in Lisburn, seven miles outside Belfast, gathered
behind police barriers in small, silent groups to gaze at the
burned-out hulk of the bombed van.
   Others later approached the site and left bouquets.
   ``We're just expressing sympathy with the soldiers that are in
this country trying to protect us and this is what they're
getting,'' one unidentified young woman told British Broadcasting
Corp. TV as she put down a bunch of flowers.
   ``We just hope that their families understand that it's not
everyone here that's like that,'' she said.
   Sean McManus, chairman of the IRA's legal political wing Sinn
Fein, appealed to families of British soldiers serving in the
province to press their government to ``withdraw from Ireland and
bring an end to the tragic deaths resulting from Britain's
partition of our country.''
   ``We regret all deaths and earnestly desire peace, but the
deaths of the six British soldiers on Wednesday night are part of
the price of the British government's intransigence,'' McManus said
in statement issued Thursday in Dublin, capital of the Irish
Republic.
   A half-marathon for charity had just ended Wednesday evening at
the close of a warm, sunny day in this garrison town, headquarters
for the British army in Northern Ireland. The exploding bomb turned
the van into a fireball and scattered torn, burning bodies onto the
street.
   ``I saw two bodies lying in the middle of the road,'' said Nigel
Sands, 19. ``One of them had no legs, and one of them was burning.
It was badly mutilated. It seems they were blown from the van.
There was panic and people were running everywhere.''
   Ten civilians were wounded, including a 2-year-old boy and a man
of 80, but authorities said none was hurt seriously.
   Political leaders in Britain and Ireland joined prominent
Protestants and Roman Catholics of Northern Ireland on Thursday in
denouncing the attack.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in the House of Commons
the bombing was a ``terrible atrocity'' and reiterated the
government's determination ``to defeat the terrorism of the IRA,
which shoot and bomb to kill.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the government's top
official in the province, conferred with army commanders in Lisburn
before flying to London to report to Parliament.
   ``There is a vital need for everybody to pay the closest
attention to personal security,'' he told reporters. ``It's
absoluely standard practice. I think, tragically, it does seem
clear that this was not followed in this case.''
   The soldiers had traveled to Lisburn from their barracks in
Londonderry, in the north of the province, in a blue van not marked
as an army vehicle. The bomb was believed to contain Czech-made
explosives, and experts were trying to determine how it was
detonated.
   An editorial in the independent Belfast Telegraph, the
province's largest newspaper, said the ``professionalism in fixing
the bomb without detection, in an open car park, is chilling.''
   It noted that soldiers were barred from participating in
civilian events after two were killed when they blundered into an
IRA funeral cortege in March. The soldiers had been permitted to
join the Lisburn event, however, and the paper asked how the IRA
found out.
   ``Somehow the word must have leaked out,'' it said. ``The bomb
was ready and the van was identified. The level of intelligence
needed was considerable, in a garrison town.''
   An IRA statement delivered to newspapers and other media in
Belfast said it planted a seven-pound bomb for what it described as
an ``execution.''
   It was the highest death toll since an IRA bomb in Enniskillen
last November killed 11 Protestant civilians, and the highest army
toll since 11 soldiers and six civilians were killed in a 1982 pub
bombing near Londonderry.
   ``Until that (British) presence is removed and the Irish people
as a unit can exercise our right to national self-determination,
the IRA will continue to wage unceasing war against the British
crown forces and the British colonial apparatus,'' the IRA
statement said.
   Britain says it will stay as long as the majority wishes. Most
Protestants, who outnumber Catholics 3-2, are loyal to Britain and
oppose union with the overwhelmingly Catholic republic.
   The army identified the dead soldiers as: Cpl. Ian Metcalfe, 36;
Lance Cpl. Graham Patrick Lambie, who would have been 23 on June
29; Lance Cpl. William John Paterson, 22; Sgt. Michael James
Winkler, 31; Signaller Mark Robert Clavey, 24, and Lance Cpl. Derek
Walter Green, 20.

   Amid the empty Gatorade bottles, flattened
tubes of sun block and stacks of fetid sweat socks, 14 Hanover High
School students leapfrogged their way into the record books
Thursday.
   Actually, the pace was more like a few steps of jogging, then a
leap. And the 14 _ who were at it on the soccer field in two-hour
shifts, round-the-clock since Friday afternoon _ weren't exactly
bounding with energy.
   But according to the Guinness Book of World Records, that
qualifies as leapfrogging, and at 11:30 a.m. the students
``frogged'' past 662 miles, breaking the record set by a fraternity
at the University of Seattle.
   Thomas Lambert and Steve Bonz, both seniors, made the record
leap.
   ``People ask which hurts more _ the bending or the leaping,''
said Doug North, 17, between swigs of Gatorade. ``It's the jogging
in between.''
   The students, who planned to continue leaping until they reach
888 miles _ estimated to happen sometime Saturday morning _ are
raising money for the Norris Cotton Cancer Center at the
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.
   So far, passers-by have donated $2,000, and the students aren't
sure how much they will raise in pledges.
   The students formed four-person teams to frog in shifts of two
hours on, four off. In between, they cheer each other on, eat,
sleep, spray each other down with hoses, soak aching ankles in
coolers of ice and take final exams.
   ``I studied this morning at seven o'clock with flash cards,''
while leaping, said Brendan Creagh, 18. Creagh said the students
are averaging 19 leaping miles a day, most of it in temperatures in
the 90s during the first heat wave of the summer.
   A cluster of tents in one corner of the field, called
``Frogville,'' is home to the leapers, and candles in paper bags
mark the path around the field at night. In one tent are some
instruments and a stereo, upon which the students played the theme
from the film ``Chariots of Fire'' as they broke the record.
   Despite the excitement, most of the leapers are looking forward
to the end.
   ``I have not done it before and I will not do it again,'' North
said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Changing Policy On Coverage Of Persian Gulf Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has decided to stop forming
``pools'' of reporters to cover Navy operations in the Persian Gulf
and instead will try to accommodate requests from news
organizations on an individual basis to board U.S. warships.
   The change in policy, announced Thursday in a brief statement,
does not change the Defense Department's commitment ``to keeping
the American people informed about the activities of military
personnel serving in the gulf,'' the Pentagon said.
   Rather, the department is now going to try ``to accommodate the
many requests received from news organizations asking for the
opportunity to send representatives to ships in the Persian Gulf,''
the statement added.
   ``We're ending the pool,'' said Dan Howard, assistant defense
secretary for public affairs. ``We will come up with a procedure
that works for everyone. This is as much a result of requests from
various news organizations as it is at our inception.''
   The Pentagon has operated a ``regional press pool'' in the
Persian Gulf for almost a year now, helping the news media to cover
the efforts of the United States to protect reflagged Kuwaiti oil
tankers plying the waterway.
   Kuwait is a key ally of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war and won
permission from the Reagan administration last year to re-register
its ships under the U.S. flag after they became special targets of
Iranian forces.
   Under the press pool procedure, a small group of reporters
representing the major wire services, broadcast networks, news
magazines and daily newspapers was formed periodically and sent to
sea with Navy warships escorting tankers.
   The dispatches filed by the pool reporters were then sent
through military channels and released to all news outlets in the
United States.
   The pool system is commonly used by the press when there are
more reporters asking to cover an event than there are spaces
available. A pool reporter is expected to share with all other
reporters the information he gathers on the media's behalf.
   According to Thursday's statement, the Pentagon has now decided
that absent an emergency or the outbreak of fighting, there is no
need to keep dispatching press pools to ensure coverage.
   Rather, efforts will now be made to accommodate individual
reporters from organizations that have not been part of the pool.
   ``The Persian Gulf Regional Media Pool will be discontinued on
July 1 and in its place, unilateral embarkations will begin, with
plans for a contingency pool as necessary,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``The success of the regional pool was due to the cooperative
efforts of news organizations and the Department of Defense to
solve the problems faced in working in a difficult environment. But
the time has come to make this change.''
   The procedures for setting up regional and national press pools
were devised in the wake of the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada,
during which the Pentagon prohibited news coverage.

<HEAD>Attorney: Asner To Pay Child Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Ed Asner will pay more than $2,100
monthly to the mother of a 10-month-old child he fathered out of
wedlock, a lawyer said Thursday.
   Under the agreement, Asner must pay $2,000 for expenses and $100
for medical insurance each month to support Charles Edward
Vogelman, said attorney Ronald Supancic, who represents the former
husband of the child's mother.
   The actor, who admitted paternity, must also pay the mortgage on
a $300,000 condominium where the child lives with his mother Carol
Jean Vogelman, Supancic said.
   The agreement ends seven months of medical tests and testimony.
Asner, star of television's ``Bronx Zoo'' and the old ``Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' and ``Lou Grant,'' eventually conceded the child was
his.
   The actor became involved in the court action when Ms.
Vogelman's ex-husband, David Stone, alleged his $3,000-a-month
alimony payment was being used to support a child that wasn't his.
   Under the court-supervised agreement, Stone must pay $2,000
monthly to Ms. Vogelman for the next three months, $1,500 monthly
for the following 10 months and $1,000 monthly thereafter.
   ``We thought it was a little out of balance that David Stone was
paying such a high monthly sum when a man of Mr. Asner's stature
had become involved with Ms. Vogelman and they had conceived a
child together,'' Supancic said.
   Asner attorney Michael Schiff said only that Asner and Ms.
Vogelman had reached an oral agreement that was being put into
writing. He didn't dispute the figures detailed by Supancic.

<HEAD>North Dakota Farmer Says 1,000 Acres Of His Grain Lost To Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STERLING, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Brown looked across a 30-acre wheat
field Thursday, at shafts of grain barely a foot tall and
shriveling from the prolonged drought that has hit North Dakota
harder than any other state.
   ``The best purpose for this right now is the cows,'' he said,
digging into dirt that was bone dry three inches below the surface.
``What we are trying to do now is get enough grazing to get the
cattle through the summer.''
   Brown's farm, which has received less than an inch of
precipitation since January, normally would be lush and green this
time of year. Instead, his pastures are parched and his grain crops
are wilted.
   Brown figures the 1,000 acres of wheat, oats and barley that he
planted this spring already have been wiped out. ``We are not even
going to start the combine this year from what I can see.''
   North Dakota farmers are selling off cattle, plowing under crops
and filing crop insurance claims while the drought Gov. George
Sinner characterizes as the worst since Dust Bowl days grips the
state from border to border.
   The drought is expected to cost the state 40 percent of its farm
income and seal the fate of many farmers who already were
struggling financially.
   ``We didn't need this,'' said economist Arlen Leholm of North
Dakota State University.
   ``The economy in North Dakota was starting to rebound. We had
crop prices that were starting to rise, not wildly, but mildly.
Livestock prices were pretty decent,'' Leholm said.
   The drought could cost the state's economy at least $2.7
billion, a loss that could throw it into another tailspin, Leholm
said.
   Direct crop losses on wheat, barley and oats will total about
$500 million. Because market prices are higher, producers will also
receive about $400 million less in federal deficiency payments, he
said.
   ``We have got large sections of North Dakota where they are
estimating that 70 percent of the crop is already gone,'' Leholm
said.
   The drought is more widespread than the last one in 1980, Leholm
said. ``The last real wipe-out was in 1961,'' he said.
   If adequate rain doesn't fall by mid-July, the threshhold for
planting later forage crops, another 10 percent of the state's
farmers could be put out of business, he said.
   One crop insurer, Rain and Hail Insurance Services, already has
received about 500 crop damage claims from its 4,500 policy
holders, said Eldon Wollmann, a field supervisor.
   ``They are coming in at about 100 a day lately now. And that's
only going to get worse,'' Wollmann said. ``I would guess that
there would be very few insured we have policies with that would
not be filing some kind of claim.''
   An estimated 40 percent of North Dakota's farmers carry crop
insurance, which basically covers a farmer's cost of production,
officials said.
   ``The way they are looking right now, if we get by paying $7
million to $8 million (in losses), we will be lucky. It could be
double that, easily,'' Wollmann said.
   For Brown, his major struggle right now is trying to find feed
for his 160 head of cattle, a herd his family has been building for
20 years.
   Already, he's sold off 32 cows and some calves for lack of feed.
``I am sure, if things don't change, there will be some more
going.''
   His alfalfa fields are brown, except for low spots that might
yield some bales of hay if it rains, he said. Brown intends to
maintain at least 100 cows, which could force him to ship the cows
elsewhere, perhaps Nebraska, for feeding this winter, he said.
   Weather forecasts are so depressing Brown has quit listening to
them.
   What he would have heard Thursday was a prediction of
temperatures in the 90s and high winds.
   ``You watch the sky and hope. That's about it,'' Brown said.

   Blacks took a self-proclaimed
national holiday Thursday, boycotting jobs and praying at churches
to commemorate the 1976 Soweto riots that set off months of
violence.
   Two bombings were reported in Cape Town and police said a
guerrilla blew himself up accidentally.
   The first bomb wrecked part of a commuter rail line in the
city's black township of Langa and the second went off in the lobby
of a civic center during a meeting of the far-right Conservative
Party, causing damage but no injuries.
   Reports said some trains from Soweto to Johannesburg were stoned
and passengers had to lie on the floor. Firebombs were thrown at
buses and delivery vans in other townships, causing serious
injuries to three blacks.
   Police said the African National Congress, the main guerrilla
movement fighting white domination, had planned a major offensive
to coincide with the anniversary but was at least partially
thwarted.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said 11 suspected guerrillas
had been killed in the past week.
   One was killed Thursday near Cape Town by explosives he was
carrying, another blew himself up Tuesday and nine, including three
women, were killed by police in two shootouts near the Swaziland
border, Vlok said.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said police were
tipped off that guerrillas based in Mozambique would try to enter
South Africa through Swaziland for ``massive acts of terrorism''
Thursday. In each of the two shootouts, it said, police stopped
vehicles at roadblocks and riddled them with bullets after someone
inside opened fire.
   The African National Congress issued a statement from its
headquarters in Zambia paying homage to blacks killed in Soweto 12
years ago and pledging to ``escalate our political and military
offensive.''
   Many blacks have regarded June 16 as a holiday since 1976, when
nationwide rioting broke out after police fired on a student march
in Soweto, Johannesburg's main black township.
   At least 575 blacks were killed in the ensuing months, when the
anti-apartheid movement acquired a new militancy.
   No official holidays mark events of specific significance to the
26-million black majority, but several black unions have negotiated
with employers to have June 16 as a day off.
   Many factories closed Thursday, and the largest daily newspaper
for blacks, The Sowetan, did not publish. Workers at three diamond
mines struck to demand that their employer, De Beers, join other
companies in making the day a paid holiday.
   Commemorative church services were held in several black
townships. Reports said security forces fired tear gas and bird
shot because of stone-throwing that occurred as blacks left a
church service in Lamontville, outside Durban.
   About 15 people gathered at Soweto's Avalon Cemetery at the
grave of Hector Pieterson, a 13-year-old shot by police during the
march in 1976.
   Pieterson's sister, Margot, 17, and his nephew, Hector Tabane,
6, put flowers on the grave, which bears a marker saying: ``Deeply
mourned by his parents, sisters, and a nation that remembers.''
Popi Buthelezi, 29, wounded in the 1976 shootings, came to the
service in a wheelchair.
   Later, 1,500 people attended a service at Soweto's largest Roman
Catholic Church. At one point, two white men in civilian clothes
were chased by members of the crowd who thought they were policemen
and grabbed cameras they were carrying. The crowd dispersed hastily
after the service with many policemen looking on.
   The Soweto students 12 years ago had been protesting a range of
grievances, particularly the use of Afrikaans in their schools.
   In July 1976, the government announced that black schools could
choose their language of instruction but activists say most other
demands, generally related to giving black communities more control
over their schools, have not been met.
   Mining executives said 24,500 of 540,000 black employees at
major mines were absent Thursday.
   The biggest stayaway was at General Mining Union Corp.'s Kinross
gold mine, where 86 percent of black workers were absent. Kinross
was the site of the nation's worst gold mine disaster when 177 men,
all but five of them black, died in a fire in 1986.
   Public Utility Transport Co., which carries hundreds of
thousands of black commuters from their townships, reported a 90-95
percent stayaway in the Johannesburg area, 50-80 percent in
Pretoria and about 30 percent in Durban. Many stores in downtown
Johannesburg because black employees were absent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis held a 15-point lead over Republican George Bush in an NBC
News-Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday, largely on the
strength of overwhelming support for Dukakis among women.
   Dukakis was supported by 49 percent of the registered voters in
the poll, to 34 percent for Bush, NBC News reported. Among men the
split was 46-40 for Dukakis, but among women his margin was 52-28.
   The national survey of 2,014 adults was conducted June 9-12. Its
result was similar to that of a Gallup poll, conducted June 10-12,
that found a 14-point Dukakis lead. Two other polls early in June
put his lead in single digits; others in May had Dukakis' lead as
great as 16 points.
   The ``gender gap'' facing Bush also appeared in an ABC
News-Washington Post poll last month, which suggested he trailed
Dukakis narrowly among men but by a 2-1 margin among women. In
another measure, the NBC-Journal poll Thursday found that only 38
percent of women said Bush cares about people like them.
   In another important measure of voter sentiment, poll
respondents said by a 2-1 margin that it is time for the nation to
change direction rather than to follow the course set by President
Reagan. And while 49 percent approved of the job Reagan has been
doing as president, 39 percent disapproved.
   Respondents disapproved, 48 percent to 41 percent, of the Reagan
administration's handling of the nation's illegal drug problem _ an
issue in which Bush has taken a prominent role.
   Dukakis was rated higher than Bush on handling the nation's
economic problems, reducing the federal deficit and dealing with
drugs. Bush was rated higher on defense and foreign policy.
   The margin of sampling error in the telephone survey was three
percentage points.

   Evan Mecham's tumultuous ride as governor
of Arizona ruined his business and landed him in two courts. But it
left him the same man as when he started: a political outsider
railing at the system that refused to work in his favor.
   Eighteen months ago the outspoken Republican was at the top, a
prosperous automobile dealer who had finally won the chance to
govern his state after five tries for the office.
   Now the governorship and the auto business are gone, one lost
when he was convicted by the Arizona Senate in an impeachment
trial, the other sold because business was lagging under the weight
of bad publicity.
   Now another critical chapter has been closed: Mecham and his
brother, Willard, were acquitted Thursday of criminal charges
related to the alleged concealment of a campaign loan.
   The 64-year-old ex-governor had faced six felony counts and up
to 22 years in prison on charges of hiding a $350,000 campaign loan
on personal and campaign financial reports required by the state.
Willard Mecham, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faced three
similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison.
   Evan Mecham insisted throughout his trial that the charges were
based on ``smoke and mirrors,'' but he had stopped short of
predicting that the Maricopa County Superior Court jury would find
him innocent.
   Although he said for months he wanted nothing more than to get
the facts out regarding the loan from attorney Barry Wolfson,
neither Mecham nor his brother took the stand during seven days of
testimony.
   It was an uncommon spell of official silence for the combative
Mecham, who testified in the Senate impeachment court and who never
shrunk from speaking his mind as governor.
   As Arizona's chief executive he angered many constituents by
canceling a Martin Luther King holiday on grounds it was illegally
created and by saying he didn't believe the slain civil rights
leader deserved a holiday.
   He was criticized for defending a book's use of the word
``pickaninny'' for blacks. Other statements deeply offended Jews,
homosexuals, women and Japanese-Americans.
   But Mecham never backed away from his comments, and he remained
defiant even after the Senate convicted him April 4 on impeachment
charges of misusing money from a state protocol fund and trying to
thwart an investigation of a death threat.
   A son of Mormon farmers, a fighter pilot in World War II, Mecham
put himself through college by selling cars in the rural town of
Ajo. In 1950 he moved his Pontiac dealership to Glendale, a Phoenix
suburb.
   He published his own newspaper in the 1960s as an alternative to
the Phoenix press. He also developed a virtual hobby of running for
public office. He won his first race in 1960, gaining a two-year
term in the state Senate.
   But he lost a 1962 bid for the U.S. Senate and ran
unsuccessfully for governor four times, including a near-miss in
the 1978 election against Democrat Bruce Babbitt.
   Fortune finally turned in Mecham's favor in 1986, when he
shocked the political establishment by winning the GOP primary and
the three-way general election race.
   Even after taking over as governor, Mecham saw himself as an
outsider attacked by an establishment of legislative leaders, the
news media and Attorney General Bob Corbin, a fellow Republican.
   In Mecham's eyes, those forces conspired to force him out of
office and into criminal court.
   But even before the jury returned its verdict, Mecham declared
he had been vindicated by the testimony.
   It ``has been totally revealed to the world that there was no
conspiracy (to hide the loan),'' the former governor said when the
defense had rested its case.
   Although Mecham often appeared haggard during his legal ordeal,
at other times he seemed anything but a broken man as he joked with
the reporters he has blamed for helping bring him down.
   In any case, he insisted all along that nothing would destroy
his peace of mind. He often quoted Abraham Lincoln, saying he would
be happy if he eventually won out but if he didn't, ``10 angels
swearing I was right won't make any difference.''

Corp. a $135.3 million, first-phase contract Thursday to provide a
new medium-lift booster rocket to ferry defense communication
satellites into orbit.
   The service announced a month ago it had selected General
Dynamics over another team consisting of the McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and the Martin Marietta Corp. to build the so-called Medium
Launch Vehicle II.
   Following that decision, negotiations were opened to finalize a
contract and that has now been done, the Air Force added.
   The service plans to purchase 11 of the new booster rockets over
the next few years. The first-phase contract covers research and
development expenses along with construction and launch services
for the first two boosters.
   Over the life of the program, each of the new boosters ``will
cost less than $40 million a copy and save the taxpayer hundreds of
millions of dollars in the process,'' said Air Force Secretary
Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge.
   ``That's the result of competition.''
   The MLV II is part of an ambitious acceleration of umanned
rocket programs started by the Pentagon after the loss of the
shuttle Challenger. The General Dynamics booster, designed to
handle payloads in the 6,000-pound class, will be a variant of the
oft-used Atlas Centaur launcher dubbed the Atlas II.

   A senior official in the Soviet
republic of Azerbaijan blamed nationalists influenced by the
Armenian Orthodox Church for protests in a territorial dispute, a
Hungarian newspaper said Thursday.
   In what it called an exclusive interview with Azerbaijan state
prosecutor Ilias Ismailov, the Magyar Hirlap quoted him as saying
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region ``has never belonged to
Armenia'' and ``any return is out of the question.''
   The parliaments, or Supreme Soviets, of the two southern
republics held separate votes this week. Azerbaijan's decided not
to give up Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenian parliament backed
demands by protesters that the mountainous region to be
incorporated into Armenia.
   About 80 percent of Ngorno-Karabakh's 160,000 people are ethnic
Armenians. It was assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923 but Armenians
consider it part of their ancestral homeland.
   ``You can only return what has been taken from you, legally or
illegally,'' Ismailov was quoted as saying. ``Karabakh has never
been part of Armenian territory.''
   Magyar Hirlap did not say when it obtained the interview with
Ismailov, which it said was conducted in Baku, capital of
Azerbaijan.
   Unrest over the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh began in February with
mass street protests in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, and strikes
and protests in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Violence folowed in Azerbaijan, where 32 people were killed in
ethnic rioting in the port city of Sumgait, most of them ethnic
Armenians. Soviet authorities said a policeman was killed in
further unrest in Baku last week.
   The Soviet Communist party daily Pravda reported last Friday
that a general strike had virtually shut down industry and
agriculture in Nagorno-Karabakh for three weeks.
   According to the Magyar Hirlap report, Ismailov said: ``What is
happening in Karabakh was well organized in advance ... by Armenian
nationalists ... and under the influence of Echmiadzin,'' center of
the Armenian Orthodox Church.
   ``The whole ideology originated in Echmiadzin,'' Ismailov said,
referring to the religious center outside Yerevan.
   Despite his accusations associating Armenia's church with the
unrest, Ismailov said the conflict should not be seen as a
religious clash between Armenian Christians and the predominantly
Moslem people of Azerbaijan.
   ``There is an attempt to give a religious color to the conflict,
saying Christians do not want to live under Moslem sovereignty,''
Ismailov said. ``To put it mildly, this is a malicious approach to
the question _ there is no religious basis to this conflict.''

   George Bush challenged Democrat Michael
Dukakis on Thursday to come up with a price tag for his proposal to
junk the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Inititative and
replace it with a buildup in conventional forces.
   ``Where do you go when you get into the most expensive side of
this of all, which is conventional forces?'' the vice president
asked, speaking with reporters on Air Force II.
   Jim Steinberg, deputy issues director for the Dukakis campaign,
said substantial funds would be freed up by halting work on the
so-called ``Star Wars'' missile defense system.
   ``The administration is now proposing to spend $4 billion on
SDI,'' Steinberg said. ``The governor feels those funds can
be...devoted to areas of greatest needs.''
   Bush, who has accused the all-but-certain Democratic
presidential nominee of lacking experience on foreign policy and
defense issues, said the Massachusetts governor's proposals could
jeopardize efforts to reach a strategic arms treaty with the
Soviets.
   ``My question to him would be: are you talking about the
winnability of a conventional war without any reliance whatsoever
on a nuclear deterrence? I don't know how he'd answer that
question. But if he answers yes, then I think he's wrong,'' Bush
said.
   ``And where's the price tag?'' he asked.
   Dukakis earlier this week, in a major foreign-policy speech in
Washington, voiced opposition to the MX missile and for SDI,
calling instead for a ``Conventional Defense Initiative.''
   ``I don't think that's a good concept,'' said Bush.
   Bush also told reporters he sees no problem with the fact that
his newly named communications adviser, James H. Lake, and his law
and consulting firm are registered lobbyists for Japanese business
companies.
   Noting that Lake, who was named to the campaign post on Monday,
is a volunteer and not a salaried campaign worker, Bush said: ``I
don't think there's a conflict at all. Are we going go now and look
at every client for every law firm for every volunteer?''
   Lake's firm, Robinson, Lake, Lerer & Montgomery, of which Lake
is chairman, represents Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Suzuki of
America Automotive Corop. and Japan Auto Parts Industries
Association, according to reports in the Detroit News and the
Washington Times.
   Bush also said he had no recollection of ever having met a
former Wedtech Corp. president, Anthony Guariglia, who testified
that he was introduced to Bush as part of an effort to obtain help
on a Navy pontoon contract.
   Guariglia made the claim on Wednesday in testimony in New York
in the Wedtech corrpution trial. He said Wedtech had raised
$200,000 for President Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign as part
of its effort to win the Navy contract.
   ``Was the guy ever at a fundraiser or something? Maybe. But I
don't remember anything, the name or anything about him,'' Bush
said.
   Asked whether he had any advice for syndicated columnist Carl
Rowan, who shot and wounded a teenage intruder in his back yard
earlier this week, Bush said: ``No, I don't have any advice for
him. I'm not having much fun out of it. I think it's a matter where
I can't make much of a contribution to it by saying anything.''
   Noting Rowan's own strong views in favor of gun control laws,
Bush added: ``I suspect it's causing him some difficulties sorting
out in his own mind, given his strong position on gun control, with
which I very much disagree.''
   ``I kind of emphathize with him on what he was going through
when somebody was coming up at him. It's all easy to second guess
now.''
   In a speech to an annual meeting of the U.S. Jaycees here, Bush
reiterated his views on strong penalties for those convicted of
drug offenses and said the policy of ``zero tolerance'' for drugs
should be applied to the workplace as well as to cars, planes and
boats.
   The vice president has proposed mandatory drug testing for
prison guards, airline pilots and for others responsible for the
public safety, and has suggested that all companies with government
contracts have ``drug free'' programs for their employes that might
include some form of drug testing.
   ``There are those who say that drug testing is an invasion of
individual rights. But the use of drugs...is a matter that affects
the lives of others,'' he said.
   Bush told his audience that while the government could not
require drug-testing or drug-education programs of private
businesses, ``each of you, pesonally, can stand up against drug
use.''
   Bush said he fully supports the zero-tolerance policy under
which yachts and other vehicles on which drugs have been found have
been seized. ``I don't mind inconveniencing a yacht owner or a car
driver if it results somehow in saving the life of one kid,'' Bush
said.
   In his talk with reporters on Air Force Two, on the way home to
Washington from Richmond, Bush said, ``I just can't get too excited
about the yacht owner, even though some would like you to believe I
am one.''
   ``Mine is 28 feet long. I want that in there too,'' he said,
referring to the $40,000 racing powerboat that he keeps at his
vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A search warrant obtained by the Justice
Department and made public Thursday reveals the background and the
theory of the government's investigation into possible corruption
involving the Defense Department and private contractors.
   The following are excerpts from that search warrant, which was
issued by a federal judge in St. Louis in response to the Justioce
Department request to search an office at McDonnell Douglas, the
nation's largest defense contractor:
   ``Melvin Paisley resigned from his position as Assistant
Secretary of the Navy for Research, Engineering and Systems in
April, 1987. In April, 1987, PAISLEY opened his own private
consulting business in the Washington, D.C. area. As a consultant
to defense contractors, PAISLEY provided advise (sic) to
corporations and contractors who do business with varous agencies
within the Department of Defense. One of his consulting contracts
is with McDonnell Douglas. A large portion of his dealings with
McDonnell Douglas are with or go through Thomas Gunn, a
vice-president in marketing.
   ``DOD awards approximately 150 billion dollars worth of
contracts every year. DOD, through its constituent agencies, makes
decisions in areas for the acquisition and award of contracts to
further the national defense. At various stages, decisions are made
in DOD and the military departments concerning the development of
defense materials, equipment and services and the allocation of
funds appropriated to DOD for the national defense.
   ``Information and data used to develop and implement the
acquisition strategies are often closely held by DOD and its
military departments and are of value and interest to companies
seeking contracts from DOD. A company with such advance information
can prepare more advantageously for procurements which are likely
to be upcoming. Moreover, if a company learns of the Government's
plans, the company can evaluate the plans and try to influence the
decision makers to make modifications which would favor the
particular company. As such, a company may want to influence a
decision about the size of a particular procurement, the
specifications for the items being procured, the prerequisites
which a company must meet in order to be eligible for the award of
the procurement, or the weighing which the Government will use in
evaluating different aspects of all competitors' proposals.
   ``Once DOD decides to seek a particular procurement, a majority
of the contracts are awarded following a competitive bidding
process. DOD has contracting officers who oversee the bidding
process and are assigned within the various military services
(Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force). The process begins with
an advertisement for a new contract which is followed by companies
receiving a document called a Request for Proposal (RFP) which
details contract specifications and other contractual requirements.
   ``A time limit is set for the recipients to respond with their
offers. Generally the price submitted by a company is critical to
the company's winning a contract because the Government usually
awards the contracts to the lowest bidder which is technically
qualified to complete the contract. Once the initial offers have
been submitted, the Government analyzes the offers for both
technical expertise and price. The government determines a
competitive range based upon the technical and pricing factors. If
it is determined that at least two of the companies' offers are
within the competitive range the competitive process is continued
for those companies.
   ``The government holds discussions with each company and tells
it where its offer is weak technically. The companies are then
asked to submit their Best and Final Offers (BAFO). The BAFO
provides them with the opportunity to adjust their offers with
respect to the price and the portions that were technically weak.
However, if the Government determines that only one company's offer
is within the competitive range, the Government can award the
contract without a BAFO stage.
   ``Information about a company's competitors' offers and the
Government's evaluation of those offers is never disclosed to a
company prior to the award of the contract. Therefore, a company
which has access to that information prior to the time when BAFO's
must be submitted can benefit greatly. The information can assist
the company in deciding how to modify its own offer.
   ``The information can also help a company learn that it has no
chance of winning a contract. Then the company can decide to either
drop out of the bidding or to seek to influence the Government to
withdraw the RFP and change it in a way to be more favorable to the
company.
   ``In addition, companies can obtain an edge if they obtain
information about the Government's intentions which have not been
disclosed prior to or during the bidding process. For instance, the
Government may not have disclosed the amount of funds it has
budgeted for a procurement or its estimates of how many options it
will exercise under a contract containing options. Such information
can help a company in drafting its proposal.
   ``The scheme involves the illegal disclosure of information and
the exertion of influence with respect to Department of Defense
contracts. The information disclosed is often provided by
Government employees receiving bribes or gratuities. The disclosed
information has been of the type that can provide a company with an
unfair advantage over its competitors and@or the government. A
substantial portion of the disclosed information is classified or
confidential.
   ``As a defense contractor consultant, PAISLEY relies upon
Government officials to provide Department of Defense contract
information which is not available to the contracting public.
PAISLEY then provides this information, for a fee or as part of his
``consulting contract'' to McDonnell Douglas, who is a Department
of Defense contractor. PAISLEY has provided McDonnell Douglas and
THOMAS GUNN substantial information obtained from Government
officials which has been classified and@or confidential or not
available to the contracting public. This information has included
the following:
   ``1) information regarding McDonnell Douglas proposed sale of
its F-18 fighter airplane to the Swiss government, including
internal information of the Navy regarding the Super Hornet
configuration; a proposed letter to McDonnell Douglas regarding the
F-18; information regarding Best and Final Offers (BAFO) on the
Swiss contract; inside information pertaining to General Dynamics
F-16 proposal;
   ``2) information regarding a co-development plan with the French
government regarding an updated F-18 (called FA-18) including an
internal Navy study;
   ``3) information regarding the sale of F-18s to Korea including,
names of individuals with ability to influence the U.S. Government
to approve the sale of F-18s to Korea and;
   ``4) information relating to sale of F-18s to European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) nations, including a telex from an EFA nation
Embassy (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain) dated
axpproximately February 3, 1988, notes on Keb briefing on the
Hornet 2000; documents on the APG 65 Radar; and letters from the
Germans on the APG 65 Radar; and letters from the Germans on the
radar for the F-18;
   ``5) the summer of 1987 Naval Research Advisory Committee study;
   ``6) early 1987 Center for Naval Analysis study regarding the
500 MG Helicopter (Killer Egg) and the future helicoper needs of
the Marine Corps;
   ``7) information relating to the Advanced Tactical Aircraft
program, including BAFO information.''

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush laid the foundation Thursday for
their general election battle in the South, with Bush trumpeting a
tough anti-drug stand in Virginia and Dukakis in Tennessee seeking
to unify his party in a region that was once its stronghold.
   A new poll said the two men are locked in a tight contest there.
And another survey out Thursday gave Dukakis a double-digit lead
nationwide.
   Dukakis started a regional campaign swing with a stop in
Nashville to pick up the endorsement of former Democratic
presidential rival Albert Gore Jr.
   ``Mike Dukakis is going to carry our party to victory in
November. He is going to win in the East, in the North, in the
West, and he is going to win right here in the South,'' Gore said
of the Massachusetts governor he criticized during the primary
season.
   Dukakis' ``image in the South and all over the country is very
different than many people thought it was going to be when this
campaign began. I think he moves beyond the old labels,'' Gore said.
   Jesse Jackson, Dukakis' remaining rival, testified before a
Senate committee on drug abuse and basked in the praise of a
senator he competed against in the 1984 presidential campaign.
   ``I would think Jesse frightened the bejesus out of them four
years ago,'' said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. ``I
remember him standing up and saying his time has come! ... This
time he's run a winning campaign. He hasn't frightened anyone. He's
charmed them in all of those different debates.''
   Hollings, the only senator to back Jackson, said Dukakis has
locked up the nomination, but he said his vote at the Atlanta
convention would be based on South Carolina Democrats' support of
Jackson.
   ``He won my home state; he certainly has earned my vote,''
Hollings said.
   Jackson met with 33 Democratic senators as he pressed for more
unpledged ``super delegates'' to the July Democratic convention to
support him. He said the party leadership ``while accepting my
investment in the party to make it strong, has not been as
reciprocal as it ought to be.''
   ``If I invest, I should reasonably expect return,'' Jackson told
reporters. ``So I appreciate the accolades that I am the voter
registration champion for the party, that I have led the drive to
return the Senate back to the Democrats...If I have done all of
that, I simply say let's be fair.''
   Dukakis welcomed Gore's support and said he looked to Jackson to
join the bandwagon.
   ``I would hope Jesse Jackson will be a part of this campaign and
as early as possible,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Dukakis added his backing to the idea of a special outside
counsel to probe charges against House Speaker Jim Wright, who will
preside over the Democratic convention next month.
   He said Wright had welcomed the idea, and he called that a
stance that ``contrasts rather sharply with the kind of
stonewalling we've had from the administration on case after case
after case.''
   Dukakis distinguished his support for Wright from his call for
the resignation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   ``That's after repeated evidence of insensitivity, a lack of
awareness of what we mean when we talk about high standards,''
Dukakis said. ``If you're attorney general of this country and
you've stumbled as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he
has and provided as weak leadership as he has, you ought to leave
office.''
   Bush, with his budget cramped by federal spending limits, went
only as far south as Richmond, Va., where the Republican vice
president declared drugs ``the ultimate fatal attraction.'' He also
renewed his call for companies to put anti-drug programs in place
before they can receive federal contracts.
   ``The point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just
a profit and loss issue, it's a matter of protecting the health and
safety of workers,'' the all-but-certain Republican presidential
nominee told the U.S. Jaycees annual meeting. ``It's no less
important than OSHA regulations on the conditions of machinery.''
   ``The federal government should not dictate what kind of
drug-free program a company should have, but it should require any
federal contractor to have one in place,'' he said.
   Bush also demanded ``Where's the price tag?'' for Dukakis's
advocacy of increased spending on non-nuclear forces, which the
Massachusetts governor called a Conventional Defense Initiative, to
replace President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Dukakis' deputy issues director Jim Steinberg replied that the
administration has earmarked $4 billion for SDI, and that freeing
up those funds would help finance other military spending.
   Drugs were Jackson's topic in testimony before the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources, where he denounced calls
for legalization.
   ``That would be a mistake. It would be surrender to the No. 1
threat to our national security. We would not think of legalization
of smog because there's a lot of it. It's dangerous,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis got some good news as he started his three-day Southern
swing.
   A new poll in nine Southern states said Dukakis and Bush are
neck-and-neck in the region once called solid for the Democrats. In
recent years, GOP presidential candidates have counted a strong
showing in the region, but pollster Claibourne Darden said Bush
can't make that assumption.
   ``I think everyone has to be surprised at how well Dukakis is
doing in the South,'' Darden said. ``George Bush himself is doing
more to break the Republican `lock' on the South than Michael
Dukakis is doing.''
   The telephone poll of 750 voters gave Dukakis the support of 45
percent and Bush the backing of 42 percent. Thirteen percent were
undecided.
   Given the poll's sampling error margin of 4 percentage points,
that finding is a dead heat for the states involved: Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee.
   And in another poll, this one nationwide, Dukakis held a
15-point lead over Bush. The NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey,
conducted June 9-12, said Dukakis had the support of 49 percent of
the registered voters polled, compared to 34 percent for Bush.
   The survey suggested Dukakis' lead was based largely on
overwhelming support among women, where he held a 24-point lead,
52-28.
   The national survey of 2,014 adults had a margin of sampling
error of 3 percentage points, NBC said.

   Candies made from enough heroin to kill a child
are the latest way smugglers are trying to bring the drug into
Britain, customs officials said Thursday.
   Twenty pounds of the fake candies, each containing the
equivalent of nearly $550 worth of heroin, have been discovered in
the luggage of smugglers arriving from Pakistan in the past three
weeks, the officials said. The total value was put at $1.34 million.
   The officials said they were alerting customs officials in other
countries, of the danger.
   ``Somewhere in Pakistan there is a factory compressing, glazing
and wrapping heroin to look exactly like sweets,'' said Mike Curr,
assistant chief investigations officer.
   ``If they are stolen by kids or otherwise get into their hands,
just one sweet will kill a child,'' he said. ``Even touching it by
unwrapping the cellophane will leave a rash as the heroin is
absorbed into the skin.''
   Howard Sutton, chief press officer at national customs
headquarters in London, said heroin disguised as candy was seized
before at a British border but called it ``a relatively new trend
in smuggling techniques.''
   He said smugglers usually baked the drug until it was black and
looked like licorice, then wrapped it in real candy wrappers.
   The fake candy was found in two confiscations involving five
passengers coming in from Pakistan, which is known as a drug
source, Sutton said.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Measure Aimed at `Colorized' Movies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With actor Jimmy Stewart looking on, a House
committee approved a measure Thursday that would create a
commission to act against ``colorized'' black-and-white movies.
   Among other things, those movies could not be shown under their
original titles if the measure becomes law _ which even backers
concede is doubtful.
   Disregarding objections that the action was an infringement on
the rights of other congressional committees, the Appropriations
Committee refused, 25-20, to delete the anti-coloring provision
from the $9.7 billion appropriations bill it later passed for the
Interior Department and related agencies.
   Several committee members, including the chairman, Rep. Jamie
Whitten, D-Miss., argued that the committee should not proceed
because the decision belongs to the Judiciary Committee and its
copyright subcommittee.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairman of the Rules Committee,
wrote Whitten to object to the procedure.
   ``Obviously this is not going to survive the Rules Committee,''
said Rep. Robert J. Mrazek, D-N.Y., a supporter of the measure.
``But if it survives this Appropriations Committee, it will send a
signal.''
   The measure is similar to a proposal pending before the
Judiciary Committee. It would set up a nine-member commission to
judge which films are significant enough to deserve protection.
   Those films, if significantly altered, could not be shown or
distributed without disclosure of the alterations and the desire of
the director or principal writer to disassociate themselves from
the changes.
   Black-and-white films to which color had been added could not be
shown or distributed under their original titles.
   The issue arose last year after Atlanta businessman Ted Turner,
owner of a gigantic film library, began releasing black-and-white
classics such as ``The Maltese Falcon'' in computer-colored
versions.
   Many film buffs and directors have objected that the process
perverts the vision of the makers of the original film.
   ``I find it offensive for a government body to designate what is
art,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., leader of the opponents of
the provision in the committee. In addition, ``We are saying that
property rights (of the owners) should be limited or terminated.''
   Mrazek argued that the issue was one of vandalizing art that
ought to be protected. He read a telegram from director Frank Capra
that complained the current owners of his 1940s film with Stewart,
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' had ``splashed it all over with Easter
egg colors and ruined it.''
   Referring to Stewart's role as the reforming senator in ``Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington,'' Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., argued,
``Mr. Smith would have been standing up in this committee arguing
against the bypassing of committee procedures.''
   The 80-year-old Stewart expressed elight after the vote, saying,
``Nobody was quite sure who was going to win right up to the end.''
   Adding color to black-and-white movies, he said, is ``really a
terrible practice and something that should be outlawed.''
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, the principal studio-producer trade association, said
Mrazek's opponents had only about five votes when the issue moved
into the committee a few days ago. ``There was a big change in my
direction,'' he said.
   Whitten's opposition is bound to be influential from here on, he
added.

   Authorities on Thursday detained Vietnamese
boat people as illegal immigrants, instead of granting them asylum
as refugees from their communist country as has been Hong Kong's
policy for 13 years.
   Officials arrested 78 Vietnamese who came ashore, under a tough
new policy to stop the influx of boat people to this tiny British
colony. The detainees will be returned to Vietnam unless they can
prove they face political or religious persecution back home.
   Britain's ambassador to Vietnam, Emrys Davies, told reporters in
Hong Kong that Hanoi ``saw enormous difficulties'' in taking back
large numbers of boat people and had given no indication it would
accept them by the early 1990s.
   Davies said Hanoi is punishing people who organize the exodus
from Vietnam but added that it was difficult to patrol Vietnam's
long coastline.
   Since the Vietnam War ended in 1975 with the communists taking
over the goverment, Hong Kong has considered all boat people to be
refugees fleeing persecution. The policy was reviewed as the number
of Vietnamese arrivals rose to nearly 8,000 this year, of which
only 1,200 have been resettled.
   Government officials say prospects are dim for finding homes for
more than 16,000 refugees now in Hong Kong camps.
   Under the policy, boat people who fled for economic reasons will
be detained until they can be sent back to Vietnam. Those who can
prove they faced persecution in Vietnam will be granted refugee
status and become eligible for resettlement.
   One of the Vietnamese who was detained told reporters that his
boat carried more than 30 relatives. Nguyen Dai Quy said he did not
know of the new policy when he left his home in central Vietnam two
weeks ago but would have fled anyway.
   The 32-year-old man said he was a political refugee, noting that
the Communist government did not allow him to pursue deep sea
fishing and that his children could not attend school. He claimed
his mother was killed by Viet Cong and he was a volunteer soldier
for the pro-American South Vietnam army during the war.
   ``I hope the Hong Kong government will change its policy and let
me get out,'' he said.

<HEAD>FDA OKs Expanded Use Of Experimental Drug For Parkinson's Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday
authorized expanded use of an experimental drug for Parkinson's
Disease, a development that could benefit 30,000 Americans with
severe forms of the ailment.
   The drug, selegilene, can be distributed under the FDA's
relatively new category called ``treatment IND'' in which promising
experimental therapies can be prescribed for desperately ill
patients before completion of the more extensive review required
for full-fledged new drug approval.
   Selegilene is the fifth drug to win such a designation under the
new regulations adopted last year. The ``IND'' in the definition
stands for ``investigational new drug.''
   Distribution is to be administered by the drug sponsor, Somerset
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Danville, N.J., which has an application
pending for full approval to market the drug under the trade name
Eldepryl.
   Physicians treating patients with severe Parkinson's who have
had difficulty with standard treatment can contact the company for
detailed information about the drug's distribution, the FDA said.
   The most widely used treatment for Parkinson's involves use of
the drug levodopa. However, that drug's effectiveness often
gradually decreases with long-term use and it needs to be given in
larger amounts that can produce increasingly severe side effects
such as nausea, involuntary bodily movements, flushing and
palpitations, said an FDA announcement.
   Parkinson's Disease is a serious, degenerative disorder of the
central nervous system that can affect people 40 and over. It is
believed to be caused by reduced levels of a naturally produced
substance in the brain called dopamine.
   Selegilene surpresses some of the enzymes in the body that
inactivate dopamine.

<HEAD>Workers Storm Naples City Hall After Hearing Factory Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of furious steelworkers attacked
government offices in Naples after learning that part of their
factory would be closed, officials said Thursday.
   Five traffic police and a doorman were injured when they tried
to block the workers.
   Hundreds of laborers gathered Wednesday in front of the
state-owned Italsider steel mill in Bagnoli, a suburb of Naples, to
protest plans announced a day earlier to close part of the plant.
   After the rally, at least 200 steelworkers went to Naples. They
burst into the offices of the Campania regional government,
smashing desks and chairs and hurling furniture and plants through
the windows, news reports said.
   Workers then proceeded to City Hall where they wrecked furniture
and knocked paintings off the walls.
   Police arrested 30 people and charged them with causing damage.
Others involved in the riot were being sought.
   The government said Tuesday it will cut 25,000 jobs from its
money-losing steel industry under a restructuring plan. The
Italsider plant employs 4,000 people.

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Limited Economic Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has passed reforms that
give state enterprises more say in production, make them
self-financing and could reduce the economic bureaucracy by 30
percent, the government said Thursday.
   The limited package passed in a special three-day session is
patterned after Soviet reforms that prescribe self-management and
self-financing for state enterprises and cooperatives while taking
away some or all state subsidies.
   CTK, the official news agency, said state companies will be
directly subordinate to ministries and that eliminating
middle-level bureaus could bring a reduction of up to 30 percent in
the economic bureaucracy.
   The reforms, which take effect next Jan. 1, were passed after a
yearlong debate. During the rest of this year, companies that
account for 30 percent of industrial production will be involved in
an experiment that gives them greater control of production
decisions.
   Czechoslovak officials gave few details on plans for economic
reform, which they approach with caution. Decentralization of
management will not go as far as in the Soviet Union and will not
take full effect until 1991.
   Premier Lubomir Strougal acknowledged in May that the economy
had not improved under his government. He said the number of
committees and bureaus between enterprises and ministries will be
reduced and the direct responsibilities of ministers increased.
   The once-efficient economy is plagued by low productivity, a
poor industrial structure, unbalanced supply and demand, and growth
of unsold inventory.
   Jaroslav Matejka, an architect of the reforms, told a news
conference last month only 48 percent of companies had applied for
the new status that brings more independence. He said some feared
being put out of business.
   Managers will be elected by secret ballot in the plant,
according to the new law, but the government retains the right to
nominate candidates for the jobs.
   New trade legislation will allow companies to make contracts of
cooperation with others inside the Soviet-led Comecon trading group
without first seeking government permission, CTK said.
   Some enterprises will be allowed to deal directly with Western
companies, bypassing foreign trade offices that now act as
middlemen.
   A new law on cooperative enterprises, which employ 1.5 million
people, affects those in both agricultural and housing and could
increase their efficiency, the agency reported.
   Housing cooperatives alleviate the chronic housing shortage in a
country where thousands of people have waited years years for new
apartments.
   Agriculture subsidies now cost $3 billion a year.
   Miroslav Toman, the agriculture minister, raised the possibility
of people being allowed to buy land.
   ``There is a situation ... when the new law allows transfer of
land not suitable for socialist large-scale production ... to other
... socialist and social organizations and individuals,'' Toman
told the daily Lidova Demokracie. He gave no details.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Calls For Expanded U.N. Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F.
Petrovsky on Thursday called for an expanded U.N. role, including a
naval force, a space agency under United Nations auspices and a
body to monitor disarmament pacts.
   ``This is a revolutionary change in our attitude toward the
United Nations,'' Petrovsky, deputy head of the Soviet delegation
to the current disarmament session, told a news conference.
   For years, the Soviet government has been wary of the 159-member
world body, but recently it has sought to strengthen it and develop
a comprehensive U.N. security system, a vague concept opposed by
the United States as unrealistic.
   The Soviet Union has been playing a major role in the current
General Assembly session on disarmament. It has also paid its U.N.
budget debts and increased the number of Soviet citizens on
permanent assignment as civil servants at the United Nations.
   The United States owes more than $240 million in U.N. dues. It
is cool toward most Soviet proposals regarding the United Nations
and does not wish to see an expanded U.N. role that could infringe
on national prerogative.
   Petrovsky said the Soviet Union was ``delivering our U.N. policy
from dogmas and subjective approaches, but ... we have every right
to expect similar self-criticism, responsibility and reason from
other states, too.''
   The United Nations, he said, should become ``a unique center for
harmonizing actions of states in our interdependent world.''
   Petrovsky said all nations should disclose to the United Nations
information on their troops abroad and their foreign military
bases. But, asked if the Soviet Union would make the first step and
disclose its military information, Petrovsky said:
   ``This is not a one-actor theater, but the world stage. We are
ready to participate in the exchange of data if other countries,
the United States and NATO, do the same.''
   In its month-long session on disarmament, the General Assembly
is expected to adopt resolutions and a final document setting out a
realistic agenda for disarmament and arms control. Western
diplomats have indicated that if the documents are unacceptable,
there will be no consensus and there could be divisive votes.
   The Soviet proposals include:
   _Creation of a U.N. naval force aimed at maintaning freedom of
navigation, and holding a joint trial exercise with fleets of the
permanent members of the Security Council _ the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union.
   _U.N. supervision of troop withdrawal from foreign territories
and the expansion of U.N. peacekeeping forces. The Soviet Union has
proposed elimination of foreign military presence and military
bases in foreign territories by the year 2,000.
   _Creation of an international monitoring and verification
agency, covering both disarmament and political settlement of
conflicts and crises.
   _Creation of a world space organization under U.N. auspices to
ensure safeguards in making outer space strictly for peaceful
purposes.
   The United States regards many of the proposals as infringements
upon its ability to behave unilaterally in its own interests and
pursue, for example, its space-based anti-missile defense
initiative, known as ``Star Wars.''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Offshore Drilling Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee approved prohibitions
Thursday on oil and gas drilling for another year in federal waters
off Florida, California and New England.
   The bans were contained in the $9.7 billion appropriations bill
for the Interior Department and related agencies that the
Appropriations Committee sent to the House floor.
   Earlier in the day, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel announced
a delay of at least six months in the planned lease offering for
New England waters to try negotiations with affected New England
governors. The sale originally had been scheduled for next February.
   Hodel also split the offering for Florida Gulf Coast waters into
two parts, with the 44-million-acre non-controversial section to be
offered in November as scheduled. An offering on other gulf waters
will be delayed at least six months while two federal-state task
forces conduct additional studies on oil spill trajectories and the
effects of any spills on the southwest Florida coast.
   Last week, Hodel similarly delayed the offering of leases off
northern California until next October.
   The committee's provisions, if upheld by Congress, will apply
until Sept. 30, 1989.
   There have been several previous bars to drilling enacted
similarly as riders to appropriations bills, and most of the
argument Thursday covered ground familiar to the members.
   Hodel's California provision was enacted without discussion.
   The Florida question is complicated by the presence of 73
previously awarded leases that were suspended for three years for
special environmental studies recently completed.
   An amendment by Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, to delete the 73
tracts from the 16 million acres of prohibited area south of about
Naples down to the Keys was defeated.
   ``The very modest amendment offered by Mr. Regula here today is
simply to say the United States will live by its commitments,''
said Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La. Regula himself argued that the
issue was, ``Can we take back the rights that people have paid for,
namely $220 million?''
   More generally though, Regula argued that ``To year after year
place a moratorium on (drilling) doesn't address the problem.'' The
issue really belongs before the Energy and Commerce Committee, he
said.
   The New England provisions expand the prohibited area
substantially from what it has been in past years by barring
drilling in waters less than 400 meters deep (1,312 feet), compared
to 60 meters (197 feet) previously.
   Regula offered an amendment to make the New England area conform
to what was prohibited in previous years, but was defeated on a
voice vote.
   New England opponents of offshore drilling say the prohibition
is needed to protect the rich, shallow Georges Bank fishing grounds
off Cape Cod, and the 400-meter provision was chosen to conform to
provisions of a 12-year Canadian moratorium in adjacent waters
adopted earlier this year.
   The action closes about 3.5 million acres to drilling and leaves
about 2 million acres available for offering in a February auction.
   Opposing the committee proposals, Hodel said there might be no
bids if promising shallow-water areas were ruled off limits off New
England.
   Lisa Speer, staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council and long-time opponent of offshore drilling, said after the
vote: ``This is a major victory. This takes the pressure off and
will allow the next administration to take a look at the offshore
program.''
   The American Petroleum Institute said the action if upheld
``would mean the abandonment of any meaningful effort to find new
supplies of oil and natural gas offshore, and is a severe blow to
the nation's future energy security. ... The record of oil company
offshore operations clearly shows that oil and gas is being
extracted without harm to the environment, to economic activity,
tourism, fishing or wildlife.''

   Ziona Tagger, one of Israel's first native
artists who was known for her depictions of the old port city of
Jaffa, died Thursday in Tel Aviv, the national Itim news agency
reported. She was 88.
   The Itim report said Ms. Tagger died at her home but did not
give a cause of death.
   Ms. Tagger studied painting at the Bezalel School of Art in
Jerusalem and at the Andre Lot Academy in Paris. She was one of the
founders of the Israeli Artists and Sculptors Association and was
awarded Israel's prestigious Dizengoff Prize for artists in 1937.
   She lived in Tel Aviv most of her life, capturing scenes of
Jaffa, where she was born, and the emerging new town of Tel Aviv in
her impressionistic style.
   Her art work has been displayed in one-person shows in Israel,
France and Egypt as well as in group exhibitions in Italy, South
Africa and the United States.
   She is survived by her son, Avraham Katz-Oz, who is Israel's
deputy agriculture minister and a member of the centrist Labor
party.

   The Federal Aviation Administration, flooded
with tens of thousands of complaints from private pilots, on
Thursday curtailed its proposed requirements for altitude tracking
devices on small planes.
   The FAA announced a final regulation which calls for private
pilots to have the altitude equipment when flying within 30 miles
of 27 of the country's busiest airports and in restricted airspace
around 109 additional airports.
   Three months ago the FAA said it was considering a much broader
regulation that would have banned private pilots from airspace
within 40 miles of 254 airports unless they had the equipment that
tells air traffic controllers a plane's altitude.
   Under the new rule, small planes also will be prohibited from
flying at or above 10,000 feet without the altitude encoding
equipment. Originally the FAA had suggested requiring the equipment
on small planes flying as low as 6,000 feet.
   The final regulation falls short of what the airlines had wanted
and closer to what the private pilots of small planes had sought.
   FAA Administrator Allen McArtor said the regulation should
reduce the danger of an aerial collision involving a small
aircraft. He called it ``a major positive impact on safety.''
   Currently the altitude encoding transponders are required on
small planes only if they fly inside controlled airspace around the
27 busiest airports. The new requirements will be phased in
beginning in July 1989.
   The move to broaden requirements for altitude-reporting
equipment stemmed from the 1986 aerial collision over Cerritos,
Calif., in which a small plane without such equipment collided with
a Mexican airliner killing all aboard the two aircraft.
   The airlines and commercial pilots have argued that small,
private planes should have the altitude encoding equipment whenever
they fly in airspace used by commercial jetliners.
   Congress had called on the FAA to broaden its requirement for
the so-called Mode-C radar signal transponders on private planes.
But when the FAA suggested in February that it might require the
equipment at 254 airports, it unleashed a flurry of protests.
   According to estimates by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association, more than 80,000 letters were sent to the FAA and to
members of Congress complaining about the proposal.
   The private pilot group argued that the additional signals from
the increased number of transponders would overwhelm the air
traffic controllers _ a claim disputed by the FAA _ and that the
additional requirements were being proposed for airspace near
airports that are not heavily used by commercial jetliners.
   Pilots also complained about the estimated $600 to $2,000 cost
for the altitude encoding transponder.
   Commercial jets as well as most sophisticated private planes
that fly in and out of the busiest airports already have the
equipment.
   The FAA long has required any aircraft flying within so-called
terminal control areas _ rings of airspace of varying size around
the 27 busiest airports _ to have the altitude encoding equipment.
The rule announced Thursday would require the equipment for flights
within 30 miles of the 27 airports beginning in July 1989.
   At 109 additional airports, which have less restrictive
airspace, private planes must have the equipment when flying within
that restricted area or up to 10,000 feet beginning Dec. 30, 1990.
   Other airports may be designated as requiring small planes to
have the Mode-C equipment within 10 miles, but the FAA said only
two airports so far have been singled out. Small planes flying
within 10 miles of Billings, Mont., and Fargo, N.D., must have the
equipment beginning in 1991.

   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, introduced a
free-standing bill Thursday that would require all but the smallest
companies to provide workers 60 days' advance notice of plant
shutdowns or mass layoffs.
   Metzenbaum's mandatory-notice proposal was one of the provisions
in an omnibus trade bill that prompted President Reagan to veto it.
The Senate upheld that veto.
   Nancy Coffey, a Metzenbaum aide, said the senator hopes Congress
will pass the plant-closing bill before any restructured trade bill
comes to the floor and that there will be enough votes to override
any presidential veto of his measure.
   The legislation would concern companies with 100 or more

   That hum of air conditioners pulled power demand to peak levels
as New Englanders kept fighting the heat Thursday, while cooler
weather prevailed for parts of the Plains and thunderstorms hit
numerous regions of the nation.
   The New England Power Pool, a consortium of 95 utilities which
coordinates electrical power for the region, recorded a record
demand Thursday and another utility, Boston Edison Co., had record
power demand for the second time in two days for the 40 communities
it serves around Boston.
   Some Massachusetts workers called the state Department of Public
Health to see if a state law allowed them to go home once the
temperatures reached a certain high. The icy answer: No.
   Readings were into the low to mid-90s from the lower Mississippi
and Tennessee valleys through central parts of Virginia and
northern New Jersey.
   Record high temperatures for the date were set in Asheville,
N.C., 91; and Portland, Ore., 93.
   Temperatures were more comfortable from the northern Plains into
the upper Great Lakes. Readings were in the 70s across much of the
region with temperatures in the 50s and 60s across northern
Minnesota and Michigan.
   The low for the nation Thursday morning was 35 at Alamosa, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Marquette, Mich., and Crescent City, Calif., to 108
degrees at Goodyear, Ariz.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from western New England
through the lower Ohio Valley into the southern Plains, but they
brought little relief to the Ohio Valley where only a quarter-inch
of rainfall has been reported.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed across the Cumberland
Plateau in the Tennessee Valley, where rainfall is eight to 13
inches below normal for the year.
   Heavy rain and small hail were reported Thursday afternoon as
storms moved across extreme southeast Pennsylvania and southwest
New Jersey.
   Thunderstorms were scattered early Thursday afternoon across
northern parts of Oklahoma and western parts of Arkansas. Showers
and thunderstorms were rapidly developing across parts of Texas and
along the front range of the Colorado Rockies.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered across central
and southern Florida and over a small part of northwest California
and southwest Oregon.
   The National Weather Service forecast showers and thunderstorms
Friday from New England through the Middle Atlantic States into the
Tennessee Valley, and afternoon and evening thunderstorms along the
front range of the Colorado Rockies.
   The rest of the nation was expected to have mostly sunny skies,
with high temperatures in the 80s or 90s; in the 70s for the
extreme northern Pacific Coast, the California coast, and across
the Great Lakes region into New England. Predicted highs were 100
to 110 degrees in the desert southwest.

   An IRA bombing in Northern Ireland killing six
soldiers, and the recent arrest of two suspected Japanese
terrorists in the United States, magnify security concerns for the
seven-nation economic summit in Toronto next week.
   Police helicopters are already whirling over downtown
skyscrapers at night and border immigration checks have been
tightened, Metropolitan Police Staff Superintendent Bernard Nadeau
said Thursday.
   ``The biggest threat is terrorism. Historically, they've always
been active at summit conferences. They have a way of getting into
a country illegally,'' Nadeau said in an interview.
   Nadeau said police were investigating a news report from Manila
Thursday that a Japanese Red Army suspect arrested in the
Philippines last week was planning to establish a base there for
attacks on the Toronto Summit and the Summer Olympics in Seoul,
South Korea.
   Police are also focusing on the safety of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, who narrowly escaped injury when the Irish
Republican Army bombed her hotel in Brighton, England, on Oct. 12,
1984.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for a booby-trap bomb in Lisburn,
Northern Ireland, on Wednesday which killed six British soldiers
taking part in a charity race.
   ``We're uncomfortable any time British royalty visits, or anyone
connected with the British government,'' said Nadeau. ``We're
always concerned that the IRA could be active.''
   Protecting Mrs. Thatcher, President Reagan and the leaders of
five other summit nations and the European Community has been made
more difficult by Canada's decision to hold the summit in the
country's biggest city. Previous North American locations for the
annual event have been Puerto Rico, Montebello, Quebec, and
Williamsburg, Va.
   The last major city to host the summit was Tokyo in May 1986,
when Japan's radical Middle Core Faction fired five homemade
rockets into the downtown area. No one was injured.
   The possibility of an attack on Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita arose in April when a suspected Japanese Red Army
terrorist, Yu Kikumura, 35, was arrested on the New Jersey
Turnpike. Police found three pipe bombs and false papers in his car.
   An 18-year-old Japanese college student, Yoshio Kosugi, was
detained June 12 in Philadelphia after police found a rifle,
grenades and ammunition in his luggage.
   Police are equipped with computer-enhanced photographs of all
known Red Army members, and a helicopter-borne rapid deployment
assault squad staged a demonstration at an Ontario military base
this month to send a message to would-be terrorists. ``The public
will never see them unless something happens,'' said Nadeau.
   Canadian Solicitor General James Kelleher said the government is
spending $4.9 million on summit security and deploying 3,000
officers and agents.
   Kelleher told Parliament Thursday: ``While we have no specific
threats at this time in any respect, there is a high level of risk
and we must be very careful and make sure nothing untoward
happens.''
   Nadeau said eight security forces are involved, not counting
secret service agents brought by the world leaders. They are the
Canadian Secret Intelligence Service, Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, Canadian armed forces, Ontario Provincial Police,
Metropolitan Toronto Police, and the Durham, Peel and York regional
police forces.
   Sharpshooters with high-powered rifles will be posted in office
towers, up to 15 city blocks will be sealed off as motorcades ferry
the leaders to and from their hotels, and city expressways will be
closed for 15 minutes at a time as delegates are escorted to dinner
engagements in the suburbs.
   ``We've had people in and out of here for four or five months,''
said Patrick Boutette of the Old Mill restaurant west of the city,
where finance ministers dine Sunday night.
   The first arrests occurred Wednesday when police broke up an
anti-summit protest at the University of Toronto and charged 15
people with trespassing.
   Police denied permission for an anti-war group, Alliance for
Non-Violent Action, to march down University Avenue to the
Metropolitan Toronto Convention Center where the leaders will meet.
``Demonstrators could occupy the attention of police and allow
terrorists to act,'' Nadeau said.
   He said police also worry about random attacks by ``unstable
persons'' like John Hinckley Jr., who shot and wounded Reagan in
1981.
   Despite its setting in a city of 3.4 million people, the summit
will take place in a security cocoon. ``At no time will the
delegates be on public view,'' said Toronto Police Chief Jack Marks.
   Local resident Alex MacKenzie called it ironic that Reagan
walked the streets of Moscow, a place he once dubbed an ``evil
empire,'' but Toronto is not considered safe enough for him to
emerge from his armored limousine.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham was found innocent
Thursday of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, a partial
vindication for the first U.S. governor impeached and removed from
office in 59 years.
   Minutes after the clerk had read the jury's last ``not guilty''
finding on the six counts against Mecham and his brother Willard,
the judge declared the trial over and Mecham's supporters cheered.
   ``Justice can occur in Arizona when you get to the people and
outside the politicians,'' the 64-year-old former governor told
reporters outside the court. ``We're happy, we're happy. You're
always apprehensive but not really surprised.''
   He said he would hold a news conference Friday morning.
   As the final verdict was read, Mecham smiled broadly and hugged
his attorney, Michael Scott, then turned and embraced his wife,
Florence. Then he crossed to the jurors and began shaking their
hands.
   Scott asked Judge Michael Ryan whether Mecham could make a
statement, but the judge refused, saying ``This is a court of law,
Mr. Scott.''
   Mecham had acknowledged he did not itemize the $350,000 loan
from developer and attorney Barry Wolfson on either his personal or
campaign financial statements. The defense said the failure was an
innocent mistake, partly due to Willard's inexperience as a
bookkeeper.
   However, the prosecution insisted that the conservative
Republican badly needed the Wolfson loan to keep his campaign
afloat, then hid it to avoid spoiling his theme of being ``beholden
to no one.''
   The jury had deliberated 6{ hours after receiving the case
Wednesday following seven days of testimony.
   Mecham could have been sentenced to 22 years in prison if
convicted on all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment
and filing false documents. His 67-year-old brother faced a maximum
9{ years on three counts.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin said after the verdict that he had
offered to let Mecham plead guilty to a misdemeanor before the
trial began, but Mecham turned him down.
   Mecham was impeached by the Arizona House and removed from
office on April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of misusing
money from a state protocol fund and trying to thwart an
investigation of a death threat. He had also faced an impeachment
trial on the loan concealment charge, but the Senate decided not to
consider the matter to avoid prejudicing the criminal trial.
   The former auto dealer had run for governor four times
unsuccessfully before he won a three-way race in November 1986.
   Gov. Rose Mofford, the Democratic secretary of state who took
over Mecham's post after he was removed by the Legislature, said in
a prepared statement that she hoped her predecessor ``and his
entire family can resume their lives as private citizens.''
   ``The end of this trial signals a hastening of a healing process
which has begun and that the citizens of this great state so richly
deserve,'' she said.
   Outside the courtroom, prosecutor Barnett Lotstein said that he
had ``we had an obligation to present this case'' and that he had
``no quarrel with the decision.''
   ``We believe we presented a responsible case that had to be
presented. We obviously felt we had a good case.,'' Lotstein added.
``A lot of the people in this community feel that he has suffered
enough, and perhaps that was a factor.''
   Lotstein said he felt the key issue was whether either Evan or
Willard Mecham ``had the intent to break the law when they filled
out the disclosure forms'' and that the jury obviously didn't feel
they had such intent.
   Judge Ryan, addressing the jurors before dismissing them, told
them that ``this case was zealously litigated by both sides, very
well done job by both sides.''
   ``I think that your verdict has shown that there can be a fair
verdict, a fair trial for all parties in this system,'' Ryan added.
``I think you're a credit to this system and I think that this
system can do the job even under intense and high publicity
situations.''
   When testimony ended Friday, Mecham told reporters the
prosecution had not proven its case, which he said was based on
``smoke and mirrors.''
   Neither defendant took the stand.
   Former top Mecham aide Edith Richardson testified for the
defense that the loan was ``common knowledge'' among Mecham's inner
circle.
   However, former Mecham insiders Donna Carlson and Mac Matheson
testified that they didn't learn about the loan until October 1987
when it was revealed by the media.
   Bur the prosecution said it was immaterial whether Mecham's
closest aides knew about the Wolfson loan. The main point,
prosecutor Michael Cudahy said, was that the loan was not listed on
the public disclosure forms required by the state.
   A state accountant, Leroy Johnson, insisted that the failure to
list the loan could not have been simply a bookkeeping mistake by
Willard Mecham.
   ``This one transaction stands out above all other
transactions,'' Johnson said. ``It's the largest single transaction
by far. The receipt is recorded a month after the fact. The name on
the receipt is Evan Mecham, not Barry Wolfson.''
   The jury's makeup was an issue before selection began, when
Mecham acknowledged in April that he asked a group of backers to
``remain quiet'' about their support of him if asked to serve on
the jury. The former governor contended he was only joking, however.
   Mecham became engulfed in controversy just one week after taking
office in January 1987, when he canceled a Martin Luther King
holiday for some state workers on grounds it was created illegally.
   He said King didn't deserve a state holiday, and later caused
another storm of criticism by defending the use of the word
``pickaninny'' in a book. Mecham also made remarks that angered
women, Jews, homosexuals and Japanese-Americans.
   The former governor also was accused of making a series of
substandard appointments to top state positions.
   Before Mecham, the last governor impeached and removed from
office was Henry Johnson of Oklahoma in 1929.

   The Senate on Thursday passed a far-reaching
welfare bill designed to help people break out of poverty through
jobs, backing it almost unanimously after acceding to White House
demands for more stringent work requirements.
   The vote on the Family Security Act was 93-3.
   The five-year, $2.8 billion measure requires stepped-up child
support collections and creation of a comprehensive education,
training and jobs program. Long-term welfare recipients or those
likely to become long-term, such as teen-age mothers, would receive
particular attention.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who wrote the bill and
fashioned a broad coalition of Senate supporters, said it would
make fundamental improvements in a system that has not changed in
53 years.
   For Moynihan, who was a presidential advisor and a professor
before joining the Senate, the lopsided vote capped decades of
studying and seeking welfare reform.
   ``This is the most important legislation of its kind and the
first legislation of its kind since the welfare system was
established in the 1930s,'' he exulted. Moynihan said that under
the current system, ``One child in four in this country will be on
welfare by age 18. That's where we were headed yesterday.''
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas called
the Moynihan bill ``an opportunity ... to set an entirely new
direction for the outdated and ineffective system we have today.''
   And Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., described it as
``the best hope'' for lifting people out of poverty and restoring
their dignity.
   Voting no on the bill were Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., and William Proxmire, D-Wis. Not voting were
Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.; Dave Durenberger, R-Minn; Chic
Hecht, R-Nev., and James A. McClure, R-Idaho.
   A bipartisan group of senators negotiated with White House
officials throughout the week following word last Friday that
Reagan would veto the Moynihan bill as it stood.
   The main obstacle as the bill neared passage late Thursday was a
White House demand that some welfare recipients be required to
participate for 16 hours a week in ``workfare,'' or community work
projects, to work off their grants.
   Governors of both parties opposed the provision to phase in
mandatory workfare participation by one adult in each two-parent
welfare household. But Dole offered it as a floor amendment and the
Senate passed it by voice vote after refusing 54-41 to kill it.
   Moynihan said the provision would affect only 6 percent to 7
percent of the welfare caseload.
   Only nine states have statewide mandatory workfare programs.
Some governors said it would be expensive, cumbersome and
unnecessary in their states. Moynihan said workfare is pointless
for people who need retraining rather than work experience and in
areas where the labor market is strong.
   Senators agreed to other White House requests as well, including
a requirement that state job and training programs include 22
percent of eligible participants by 1994.
   The agreement added about $200 million to the five-year cost of
the bill, bringing it up to $2.8 billion. The House already has
passed a more generous, $7 billion welfare plan.
   Negotiators for each chamber will reconcile differences in the
two bills before a plan is sent to the White House. Whether Reagan
supports the final measure depends largely on the extent to which
House members are willing to go along with the Senate product.
   Aid to Families with Dependent Children, established in 1935 as
part of the Social Security system, currently supports 3.7 million
families which include some 7 million children.
   Originally conceived as a widow's benefit when women _
especially mothers _ did not work outside the home, the program now
is dominated by divorced and unwed mothers at a time when the
majority of new mothers are at work within a year of having a child.
   The centerpiece of the House and Senate bills is a new jobs
program under which states would have to offer a wide range of
activities including job training and basic education as well as
actual work. They would have to include as many people as they
could afford, and half the money would have to be spent on people
needing the most help.
   A 1987 study of current welfare-to-work programs found that they
did not have nearly enough money, that they offered limited and
superficial services, they lacked essential support services such
as child care, put too much emphasis on job placement rates,
funneled people into low-paying jobs that didn't get them entirely
off welfare, excluded mothers of children under 6 and tended to
help people who really didn't need it while ignoring tough cases.
   The House and Senate bills attempt to correct most of these
deficiencies. Each envisions a substantial federal financial
commitment to the jobs program and describes or mandates activities
to be offered. They improve child care benefits and guarantee child
care for people in the program. Mothers with children under 3 would
be exempt from the work-training requirement, and states could
lower that to age 1.
   Both bills also require states to extend welfare benefits to
poor two-parent families. The Senate bill only would require the
benefits for six months in any 12-month period; 26 states already
provide year-round coverage.
   A major difference in the two bills is that the House offers
extra federal money to states that raise benefits to needy
families, which in many cases have incomes well below half the
federal poverty line.
   Money to cover additional spending under the Moynihan bill would
come from making permanent a tax refund withholding program to
recover federal debts, and eliminating the business food and
entertainment tax deduction for people with incomes over $440,000.
   The Senate approved the meals and entertainment provision
Thursday in place of a provision phasing out the dependent care tax
credit for higher-income families.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., sponsor of the substitute, said the
original plan would have constituted a tax on child care and added,
``I'm against punishing women for their professional success.''
   The Moynihan bill attracted opposition not only from
conservatives seeking tighter work requirements but from mothers
who said they should not be forced to work at all. A group called
Wages for Housework complained that the measure was ``designed to
get women off the welfare rolls, not out of poverty, and denigrates
the work of all mothers.''

<HEAD>Conference Addresses Black Mayors' Concerns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The leading presidential candidates must address
black Americans' concerns or face losing the support of ``a sizable
number of people,'' the head of the National Conference of Black
Mayors said Thursday.
   ``Those folks who want to go into office _ Gov. (Michael)
Dukakis and George Bush _ and don't take those populations that we
represent seriously, then we will not take them seriously,'' said
John H. Smith, mayor of Prichard, Ala.
   ``Whatever it takes for us to send that signal to them by not
voting for them or voting for folks who share our views, we'll do
that,'' Smith said.
   Republican Bush, Democrat Dukakis and Democrat Jesse Jackson
were invited to attend the conference, but only Jackson has
confirmed that he will speak Saturday, Smith said.
   ``We want to caution those folks who tend to ignore these
meetings and who are running for various offices who don't spend
time discussing our agenda,'' said Smith, a Republican.
   ``If they don't show up here, we have decided at this conference
to organize our populations ... and say to those folks who are
running for office what we want to do,'' said Smith, joined at a
news conference by Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode and about 20
of the 200 mayors attending the four-day conference.
   Smith said he doubts Jackson will be selected as Dukakis'
running mate because of the ``further continuation of the attitude
of the Democratic party in its liberal traditions of looking at
black folks simply as appendages, as followers rather than
leaders.''
   Goode, a Jackson supporter, said Dukakis and Jackson should sit
down and resolve the issue.
   ``He's earned the right to be considered,'' Goode said. ``He's
earned the right to be respected as one of the leading leaders of
our party.
   ``If he's not granted that respect, then I think there's going
to some very difficult times in front of us as a party.''
   Goode, vice chairman of Pennsylvania's delegation to the
Democratic Convention in Atlanta, criticized party rules that force
him to go as a Dukakis delegate.
   Goode said he plans to vote for Jackson on the first ballot,
even though rules require him to vote for Dukakis.
   ``As far as I know, slavery ended a long time ago,'' he said.
``I will do it.''
   Economic, racial and health problems have emerged as other major
concerns of those attending the 14th annual convention, which runs
through Saturday.

   Ever wonder what would happen if
you really let a bull loose in a china shop? So did Grant Burnett.
So much, in fact, that he put the cliche to a test in his own store
on Thursday.
   Nothing happened.
   ``I'm pretty relieved,'' Burnett admitted after fulfilling what
he said was a lifelong ambition _ letting a 2,400-pound bull roam
through his store for three hours.
   ``We managed to get him out of the shop before anything
happened,'' Burnett said.
   Not that there weren't tense moments. Burnett said $60,000 worth
of china was at stake during the romp by the bull, nicknamed ``The
Colonel.''
   Burnett said he attempted the feat at his shop in Palmerston
North, near Wellington, after constantly being egged on by
customers familiar with bull-in-a-china-shop cliche.
   While ``The Colonel'' shopped around, Burnett said, he got a
call from a radio station in Stoke-on-Trent, Britain, known as the
home of bone china. Representatives of the Guinness Book of World
Records as well as the international media also turned up to watch
the stunt.
   Burnett took some precautions. Before the event, he said, he
insured his china at an undisclosed premium. Just in case.

   A French woman said she was mistaken when
she thought her grandson was the unidentified, hearing-impaired boy
found last year wandering the streets of Juarez, Mexico.
   Camille Muller thought photos of the boy strongly resembled her
grandson, Philippe Muller, but the 13-year-old boy was located
Thursday in El Paso, an FBI spokeswoman said.
   Mrs. Muller said Thursday night in Paris that she had just
spoken by telephone with her son, who told her that he, her
daughter-in-law and her four grandchildren were in good health.
   Since January 1987, she had not heard from her son, who runs a
restaurant called ''JJ de Paris'' in El Paso.
   ``The FBI arrived at the restaurant as I was talking to my
son,'' Mrs. Muller said. ``For all that, the mystery of this child
is not solved. I am delighted for me and I am very upset for this
child.''
   Mrs. Muller said her daughter-in-law's mother in Mexico City had
been very ill and possibly had died. She speculated that the family
could have been on their way to Mexico City at the time of the
plane crash.
   Mrs. Muller's daughter-in-law, Marguerite Muller, said:
   ``I saw the news last night, and they were talking about it and
my daughter Pearl and I were laughing and saying it sounds like
something Mamie (Camille Muller) would do. But we just didn't
believe it could be her. She showed a picture and it didn't look
much like Filipito.
   ``Knowing her, it sounds like something she would do ... I can't
get over it. But being so far away from (her son) and not knowing
his whereabouts, I can see where she would jump on this.''
   Camille Muller contacted the U.S. Embassy in Paris Tuesday after
recognizing the boy from pictures in a French TV news report. She
said her daughter in Paris also was struck by the resemblance.
   On Thursday she gave the embassy a dozen family photos of
Philippe that were forwarded to authorities in Texas.
   ``The resemblance is more than passing,'' said Christopher
English, chief of special consular services at the embassy, who
received the photos.
   Since he was found last November, Mexican and U.S. authorities
have been trying to identify the boy, nicknamed Sabat because he
was found on a Saturday _ sabado in Spanish.
   Authorities don't know Sabat's real name or where he's from, but
they believe he is 7 or 8 years old. He has been staying at a
child-care center in Juarez since he was found.
   Sabat is deaf in his right ear and has 25 percent hearing in his
left ear. He communicates mainly through gestures and drawings. His
pictures indicate that he survived a plane crash that killed his
sister and parents.
   If Sabat's relatives can't be found, he will be put up for
adoption in Mexico, authorities have said.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi forces recaptured an Iranian-held
mountain peak in Sulimaniyah province in northern Iraq on Thursday,
the army said.
   Senior army spokesman Abdul Jabar Muhsen told reporters the
Iraqi 1st Army Corps took the strategic Ahmad Romi mountaintop in a
major offensive launched Thursday.
   The mountain, more than 6,500 feet high, overlooks an entire
Iraqi valley. It is just over four miles from the Iraq-Iran border
and about 25 miles northeast of Sulimaniyah, Iraq's largest
northern city and the provincial capital of the Kurdish region.
   The Iranians captured the peak and the adjacent town of Mawet in
fierce fighting last summer.
   Muhsen gave no battle details, but the official Iraqi News
Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the air force flew 221 combat
missions on Thursday with all aircraft returning safely. INA said
helicopter gunships completed 115 of the missions.
   Heavy use of helicopter gunships is usually an indication that
Iraq is trying to counter ground assaults by Iran. The Iraqi
communique reported fighting a several points along the
730-mile-long border between the two countries.
   An Iranian news report Thursday said a rebuilt F-14 fighter jet
successfully completed test flights at an air base in Isfahan. The
television report, monitored in Nicosia, said the fighter's
electrical system caught fire 11 months ago.
   Iran has had difficulty obtaining high-tech spare parts for its
air force, purchased in large part by the late Shah's government
from the United States, due to a longstanding American arms embargo.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   Their battle claims can rarely be verified independently since
neither country as a rule allows foreign journalists into the war
zones.

<HEAD>German Chancellor Covers Farm Subsidies, East-West in Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family farm in Europe must remain viable and
subsidies cannot be rolled back overnight, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of West Germany told the Canadian Parliament on Thursday.
   Kohl, the first West German head of government to address
Canada's legislature, acknowledged criticism of Europe's Common
Agricultural Policy and the $300 billion global farm-subsidy war.
   He said he opposed permanent subsidies in principle but added:
``When developments have taken a long course over 20 years, you
cannot remedy the situation overnight ... the family farm must
remain viable in Europe's future.''
   The United States has proposed phasing out agricultural
subsidies by the year 2000, and Canadian officials had hoped for a
compromise at the seven-nation Economic Summit which starts Sunday
in Toronto.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in welcoming Kohl that summit
nations ``must come to grips with the acute problem.''
   But the 12-nation European Community has been reluctant to
dismantle subsidies to small farmers because of the political
outcry that would follow.
   In a wide-ranging, 55-minute address, Kohl likened the new
U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement to European Community plans to
create a unified market for goods by 1992.
   That uniform market of 320 million consumers will remain
accessible to other countries, Kohl said, and he counted on Canada
to ensure the same will be true of North America under free trade.
   ``We trust the assurances of our Canadian friends that European
companies, too, will be able to use the new opportunities to
increase trade.''
   The U.S.-Canada treaty, due to take effect Jan. 1 if ratified,
would eliminate all tariffs over a 10-year period and dismantle
other barriers.
   Kohl arrived Wednesday night for his first official visit to
Canada, prior to the Economic Summit. Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita arrived in Vancouver on Thursday to tour the west
coast province.
   Kohl said his government's central goal is to overcome the
division of Germany and the rest of Europe, ``to make the frontiers
more permeable, to reunite separated families, facilitate human
contact and develop a lasting and equitable, peaceful border.''
   He thanked Canada for stationing 7,000 troops among NATO forces
in his country and said allied solidarity had contributed to recent
arms control breakthroughs by the superpowers.
   He said the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional weapons
and capacity for surprise attack are now the basic problem in
European security.
   ``Eliminating these capabilities must be the objective of future
negotiations,'' which he hoped would begin this year, Kohl said.
   The chancellor concluded by recalling the aid his country
received after World War II. ``We were half-starved. I felt at that
time what it means for a country to receive help ... and we haven't
forgotten that.''
   He said it was a moral duty to extend similar aid now to the
Third World, declaring, ``I'm one of those who believe that in the
first quarter of the 21st century, the hazards and challenges of
the North-South conflict (industrialized nations and developing
nations) will overshadow East-West problems.''

   A billboard advertising campaign for
Porcelana Fade Cream that features light-skinned black women as
``faded beauties'' shows a lack of sensitivity toward minorities,
blacks said Thursday.
   ``I saw the billboards, and I couldn't believe this thing was
coming back again,'' said Sharmain Turner, chief of staff for state
Sen. Roxanne Jones of Philadelphia. ``I was definitely offended by
it.''
   The Porcelana billboards show the product name, a close-up
photograph of two light-skinned black women and the words ``Faded
Beauties of Philadelphia.'' One billboard, before it was covered by
a new advertisement, was embellished with graffiti that changed
``faded beauties'' to read ``faded pride'' and the words ``Stop
Racist Advertising'' were written across it.
   Fade creams are frequently advertised in black-oriented
magazines for correcting uneven skin tones or diminishing scars and
blemishes, but critics say the billboards imply lighter is better.
   Officials for the Los Angeles-based Dep Corp., which makes and
distributes Porcelana, declined to comment on Thursday.
   Porcelana might not have meant to promote the cream as an
overall skin lightener, but the possibility is the crux of the
problem, said Paul Bennett, executive editor of The Philadelphia
Tribune, a tri-weekly that is one of the oldest black-owned papers
in the United States.
   ``I don't know if it's out and out blatant racism that makes for
these kind of decisions, but there seems to be a certain lack of
sensitivity that is born of out of some form of racist attitude,''
Bennett said.
   ``The issue is not so much that particular billboard,'' Bennett
said. ``The issue is the treatment of black folks in advertising
across the board.''
   A Penn State researcher who has studied the effects of
minority-targeted advertising said
   The controversy might be an example of a company misjudging the
message it sends to consumers, said Jerome Williams, a marketing
professor at Penn State who has studied the effects of
minority-targeted advertising.
   ``Even if they didn't mean to offend, what you have to be
concerned with is the decoded message _ what did it mean to the
consumer,'' Williams said.
   ``If that decoded message is leading to a negative perception,
regardless of the intent of the advertiser, they should change (the
advertisement.''
   In an atmosphere of increased minority pride and activism,
advertisers can find themselves in trouble if they fail to consider
the sensitivity of their target group, he said.
   Black consumers wield well more than $200 billion of purchasing
power, while Hispanic consumers have more than $100 billion,
Williams said.
   ``I think you're going to find more and more consumers who are
going to use that purchasing power to reward those advertisers who
are sensitive to their issues,'' Williams said.
   Advertisers who aggravate minority consumers may find that
consumers not only avoid a product, but may actively campaign
against it, Williams said.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Condemns Killing of Agronomists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador condemned as ``vile and
horrendous'' Thursday the rebel killings of an U.S. agricultural
adviser and his Peruvian colleague and another U.S. official said
such workers may be withdrawn from danger areas.
   ``Constantine Gregory and Gustavo Rojas were men who dedicated
their lives to helping Peruvian campesinos (peasants),'' Ambassador
Alexander Watson said in referring to the attack Monday on an
isolated road near Huancayo, 125 miles east of Lima.
   Officials said Gregory, 25, of Los Angeles, and Rojas, 27, were
shot by leftist Shining Path guerrillas in a highland insurgency
zone near Aramachay, a mountain hamlet 15 miles north of Huancayo.
   The words ``This is the way the lackeys of Yankee imperialism
die'' and a hammer and sickle were scrawled in red ink in Gregory's
notebook, according to reporters at the scene.
   The Shining Path, an 8-year-old Maoist insurgency, has
frequently assassinated development workers in Peru's impoverished
highlands in an effort to spawn economic chaos.
   The victims were working on a project funded by the U.S. Agency
for International Development, which spends more than $50 million
yearly in Peru on farm, health and food relief programs, agency
officials said.
   The officials refused to say if the attack would prompt the
agency to alter or limit its Peruvian operations. AIDhas about 20
American agents here and dozens of U.S. and Peruvian technicians
work under special contracts.
   But a U.S. official who supervises a research program funded by
the agency said meetings were planned to discuss withdrawing
workers from potentially dangerous rural areas.
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
the U.S. Embassy sent investigators to find out if Gregory's
killing was circumstantial or represented a decision by Shining
Path leaders to target Americans.
   Gregory was ``just a kid wanting some experience'' before
returning to the United States for graduate school in August, one
U.S. development official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Following an autopsy Thursday near Huancayo, the bodies of the
men were taken to Lima, the embassy said. Officials said the
families, including Gregory's American wife, Maria Dolores, will
travel to the Peruvian capital Friday.
   The guerrillas shot each man in the back of the head after
halting the four-wheel-drive vehicle they were driving, police said.
   The attackers then dynamited the vehicle and fled in a truck,
the police said, adding that 100 people were arrested in sweeps of
the area after the killings.
   Gregory, a graduate of the University of California at Santa
Cruz, was the second American to die in the Shining Path's
eight-year insurgency to impose Marxist rule. Dozens of Peruvian
development workers have been among more than 10,000 people killed
in the violence.
   A Texas woman was one of seven passengers killed in a Shining
Path bombing of a tourist train in June 1986.

   President Reagan intends to nominate Carl
Copeland Cundiff, a career Foreign Service officer, to be
ambassador to the Republic of Niger, the White House announced
Thursday.
   Cundiff, 47, entered the service in 1965. From 1966-68 he was
assigned to the American Embassy in Singapore. He was an economist
for the Agency for International Development in Saigon from
1968-69; the U.S. Mission to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development in Paris from 1970-73; and the monetary
affairs bureau of the State Department from 1974-77.
   Since 1986, Cundiff has been office director in the office of
food and policy programs for the economic bureau of the State
Department.
   Cundiff, a New Orleans native, graduated from the University of
the South in 1963, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1964 and
Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 1974.

<HEAD>Playing Bagpipes Can Damage Hearing, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High noise levels from bagpipes can knock a
Scotsman's hearing out of kilter _ and even cause permanent hearing
loss, a neurologist and amateur bagpiper said Thursday.
   Dr. Stephen M. Brittain of Rutland, Vt., and audiologist Robert
W. Hartenstein measured noise levels produced by the bagpipes and
reported their findings in a letter in the June issue of the
Archives of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
   Indoor and outdoor levels at the player's left ear reached up to
105 decibels, they wrote.
   Noting that federal noise exposure maximums are 105 decibels for
one hour and 115 decibels for 15 minutes, they said it would be
fairly easy for pipers to meet or exceed these limits ``with
steady, dedicated practice.''
   Good quality foam ear plugs can sharply cut noise levels, they
said.
   Brittain, who said he had been playing the pipes about three
years, became concerned when he found playing the pipes was almost
a painful experience at first.
   He said he started wearing earplugs, but believes few pipers are
aware of the risks of permanent hearing loss and few probably wear
ear protection.
   He said the ear protection he wears reduces the sound level
about 25 decibels and does not interfere with hearing and
evaluating his own playing.

<HEAD>Mutilation Rapist Offered Money to Get Out of Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mutilation rapist Larry Singleton was offered
$10,000, living expenses and a one-way ticket out of Florida on
Thursday by a car dealer and a radio station anxious to get him out
of town.
   In a full-page newspaper ad, Bradenton car dealer Tom Stimus
offered $5,000 and volunteered to pay rent and utilities for six
months _ at a non-Florida address _ for the 60-year-old former
merchant seaman.
   Stimus, 49, previously has offered rewards for the assassination
of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini,
with no takers.
   St. Petersburg's WQYK-FM matched Stimus' $5,000 offer after 99
percent of hundreds of listeners responding to an on-air poll said
they wanted Singleton to leave, said station spokeswoman Diana
Thomas.
   Singleton served eight years of a 14-year sentence in California
for raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker, chopping off her forearms with
an ax and leaving her for dead in a ditch near San Francisco in
1978.
   He finished parole in April and recently moved back to Florida
where he has family. He grew up in the Tampa Bay area.
   Singleton registered with state authorities Monday to comply
with Florida law that any felon moving into the state must list his
address. He gave his brother Walter's address in the Forest Hills
area.
   When they found out Singleton was their neighbor, residents of
the quiet, middle-class area said they were angry and afraid. More
than 40 of them met Wednesday night and started a petition drive
demanding that he move out.
   ``We are being asked to change our life styles because of one
lunatic,'' said Dick Sells, 42.
   Several residents said they would no longer allow their children
to go out alone.
   One resident said, however, that Singleton's relatives said
Singleton isn't living in Forest Hills, but is using his brother's
address while living 2{ hours away from Tampa.
   Some residents expressed fears not only of Singleton, but also
of misguided vigilantism. Lester Heitlinger, 66, has a gray beard _
as does Singleton.
   ``Anybody with a gray beard that walks by is a suspect,'' he
said.
   California officials seeking to place Singleton during his
parole were met by community protests, and local law enforcement
officials said they feared they could not guarantee his safety.
   Singleton finally served his parole time while living in a
mobile home within the gates of San Quentin state prison.

   A Senate panel voted Thursday to slash
spending for the space station to $200 million, a move officials
said will strangle the program unless the appropriation is
increased dramatically.
   The Reagan administration had requested $967 million for the
space station in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
Officials say at least $900 million is needed to keep the space
station on schedule for a completion in the late 1990s.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said $200 million ``provides only
enough for the slow strangulation of the space station'' and that
President Reagan's personal intervention will be needed to rescue
the program.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he would ask Reagan to veto the
spending bill that includes funds for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration if not enough money is set aside to sustain
the space station.
   The NASA money is part of a spending bill that also includes
funds for the Veterans Administration, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development and other agencies.
   ``I am hopeful that we may yet in the Senate do something to
correct this situation, but it is an uphill battle,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm called the Senate action, as well as the House version of
the space station bill earlier this week, ``totally irresponsible.''
   ``In this election year, Congress is clearly looking at the next
election and not the next generation,'' Gramm said.
   The Senate committee's space station bill calls on the next
administration to review the project in January and if the new
president wants it to continue, he would have to ask Congress for
additional funds. NASA has estimated the project could cost more
than $20 billion to complete.
   In the House version, the Appropriations Committee voted this
week to spend $387 million on research and development on the space
station. Another $65.4 million would be held in an account, and
should the next president decide not to continue with the program,
those funds would be used to shut down the program.
   Additionally, $450 million would be held through April 15. If
the president decides to continue with the program, the money would
go to the space station. If not, $150 million would be transferred
to space flight control and data communications at NASA, and the
remaining $300 million would be rescinded.
   ``The House approach _ to fence part of money and wait to see if
new president wants to have a viable space program _ is passing the
buck, to say the least,'' Gramm said.
   ``Our problem clearly is that there are other programs with
large numbers of constitutents more appealing politically than
programs such as space and science. And we've been seeing this over
and over for the last three years,'' Gramm said.
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said construction of the space station
could begin next year if it stays on schedule. The space station is
planned to be in orbit around Earth and occupied by astronauts by
the end of 1996.

   The Defense Ministry said Thursday
that rebels attacked a military unit in violation of a cease-fire
and kidnapped six civilians.
   A ministry statement said two soldiers were killed and three
wounded when rebels ambushed three Sandinista army trucks in
northern Jinotega province Wednesday.
   It said six civilians were kidnapped in various parts of the
country.
   The U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, and the leftist
Sandinista government agreed to suspend offensive military
operations on March 21, when talks began which led to an agreement
to seek a definitive cease-fire in the civil war. The two sides
have made little progress since then.
   The Contras have accused the Sandinistas of violating the truce.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega accused the rebels of
``flagrant violations of the cease-fire'' in a letter sent Thursday
to Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, and Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo,
the archbishop of Managua.
   Soares and Obando y Bravo served as witnesses to the
Sandinista-Contra peace talks and are responsible for verifying the
cease-fire accords.
   Ortega, brother of President Daniel Ortega and head of the
government negotiating team, also noted that Contra leaders were
seeking renewed military aid from the United States in violation of
the agreements.
   In Washington, Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra
directorate, told reporters Thursday the Reagan administration
agreed to seek a new aid package for the rebels, who have been
fighting the Sandinistas for six years.
   Ortega asked Soares and Obando y Bravo to investigate the
civilian kidnappings. The government claims the Contras have
kidnapped more than 1,000 Nicaraguans. The rebels have acknowledged
holding 66.
   Ortega also criticized a rebel proposal to include President
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica in future peace talks.
   Arias received the Nobel Peace Prize last year for being the
author of a regional peace plan signed by five Central American
presidents last August.

<HEAD>Five Detained by Police in Rallies Marking Execution of Revolt
Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police detained five Hungarian
dissidents Thursday on charges they chanted anti-government slogans
and incited a crowd in rallies marking the execution of leaders of
the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt.
   Witnesses said the five, all known as leading dissidents in
Budapest, gathered in a downtown square and chanted, ``Democracy''
and ``Nagy'' after a peaceful morning vigil at the unmarked graves
where Imre Nagy, a leader of the 1956 revolt, and associates are
believed buried.
   The ceremonies marked 30 years since the official media
published a Ministry of Justice decree on June 17, 1958, announcing
the four were sentenced to death for having ``played a leading role
in the preparation and starting of the counter-revolutionary
uprising in October 1956.''
   Calls for Nagy's rehabilitation and that of some of his
associates have become increasingly frequent.
   The 1956 revolt began Oct. 23 with mass demonstrations for a new
government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. But
200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks struck Budapest Nov. 4 to
quell the uprising.
   The official MTI news agency said in a terse report that ``a
group of persons who had been active in the 1956 events'' gathered
in Budapest despite a police warning.
   The report said the men then ``tried to bring under their
influence a crowd of about 350 to 400 persons whom they had
mobilized.''
   ``Police took the necessary steps to ensure public order. In the
course of this, Sandor Racz, Gabor Demszky, Roza Hodosan, Jenoe
Nagy and Peter Egetoe were taken to the police station,'' the
report said.
   Witnesses said a group of about 20 or 30 people laid flowers in
mid-afternoon at the eternal flame to a Hungarian premier executed
in the abortive 1848 revolution against Austria and stepped back
into a crowd of about 400 people who had gathered.
   About 150 police guarded the square and conducted frequent
identity checks, the witnesses said. One witness said police
charged onlookers who tried to approach the flame.
   After a half-hour, the crowd moved towards the Danube river and
then on to the nearby Hungarian television station, the witnesses
said. There, dissident Janos Kiss addressed the crowd but a witness
said the speech was drowned out by crowd chants of ``AVO'' to the
waiting police.
   The AVO was the dreaded secret police in the 1950s.
   The witness said riot police then moved in to break the crowd.
It was not immediately clear if anybody was injured.
   A reporter for Austrian radio said Thursday's vigil at what is
believed to be Nagy's unmarked grave drew at least 250 people.
   The area was scattered with crosses, candles, flowers and small
Hungarian flags. A list of names of those executed after the 1956
uprising was read and an unidentified speaker called for their
rehabilitation and proper graves for them, a witness said.
   Rehabilitation would likely require approval not only from the
Hunagrian Communist party but also from Moscow, which is thought to
have played a key role in ordering Nagy's execution.
   There was no official Hungarian report on either of Thursday's
events, which were announced last week by a 37-member committee
calling itself ``Let Justice Prevail'' and including Nagy's
daughter, Erzsebet.

<HEAD>Immigration Service Denying Parole To Hundreds of Cubans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials said Thursday they are
denying parole to about 970 imprisoned Cubans, each of whom will be
notified individually of the decision by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said that while more than 1,500
detainees have been released since Cubans rioted at two federal
prisons last November, these are the first notices of denied parole
to be issued.
   Detainees may appeal the denial of parole to a review panel at
the Justice Department, he said.
   Detainees being denied parole are being notified by
administrators at the federal institutions where they are
incarcerated, and each prison is using its own judgment on whether
to take special security precautions, Austin said.
   The detainees were among 125,000 Cubans sent to Florida in the
1980 ``freedom flotilla'' boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel.
Most committed crimes following their arrival in the United States,
served their sentences and were held by the INS for deportation to
Cuba, which refused to accept them.
   Federal prisons in Oakdale, La., and Atlanta erupted in riots
last November after the State Department announced that Cuba had
agreed to take back about 2,500 refugees considered undesirable by
this country.
   The rioting involved the taking of 138 prison employee hostages
and the death of one detainee. The government estimated the 1,394
inmates at Atlanta and 987 at Oakdale destroyed $64.4 million in
prison property and that it cost $48.9 million to quiet the
disturbances and relocate the Cubans.
   A Justice Department report on the riots concluded that the
State Department gave too little notice of the deportation
agreement and prison employees failed to report early signs of
trouble.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
appealed to South Africa on Thursday, the 12th anniversary of the
Soweto riots there, to grant clemency to six blacks awaiting
execution.
   The Pretoria government's determination to hang the
``Sharpeville Six,'' who were convicted of taking part in a 1984
riot in which a black Sharpeville town councilor was killed, has
provoked worldwide appeals to spare their lives.
   ``In view of the decision by the South African judiciary to
extend the stay of execution to July 19 but not to reopen the
trial, the secretary-general appeals once again on humanitarian
grounds to President (P.W.) Botha to grant clemency to these young
people,'' said Francois Giuliani, spokesman for Perez de Cuellar.
   The U.N. chief first asked Botha on March 15 to grant clemency.
   President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
were among other world leaders who protested the hangings, which
were postponed in March just 15 hours before the scheduled
execution.
   The Sharpeville Six, ranging in age from 24 to 36, were not
proven to have physically attacked the official, but were convicted
of having ``common purpose'' with the slayers.
   U.N. officials devoted Thursday to special observances of Soweto
Day, commemorating July 16, 1976, when police attacked
schoolchildren in the black township of Soweto, near Johannesburg,
who were marching to demand edicational reform.
   Ten marchers, including two students, died in the attack. The
incident set off a nationwide rampage in which hundreds of South
African blacks were killed.
   Perez de Cuellar spoke before the U.N. Special Committee Against
Apartheid on Thursday to condemn South Africa's legal system of
racial segregation: ``Apartheid is not a system that can be
reformed _ it must be ended,'' he said.
   General Assembly President Peter Florin of East Germany told the
committee that ``all those who still argue that apartheid could be
removed by way of reforms should at last have been taught
otherwise. ... Apartheid can only be eradicated.''

   Federal investigators armed with evidence from
two years worth of wiretaps and this week's coast-to-coast raids
are preparing to approach witnesses who now may be forced to
cooperate with the government's massive Pentagon purchasing fraud
probe.
   The probe has turned up ``rampant bribery in the government''
and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of cars and
payments of bills for government employees, Sen. John Warner said
Wednesday.
   Government sources familiar with the probe said searches of
offices of 15 defense contractors on Tuesday stemmed from wiretaps
on the offices of two top Pentagon officials. The bugs have been in
place for much of the two-year investigation.

   The share of women returning to work, or actively seeking jobs,
within a year after arrival of a baby climbed to 50.8 percent last

   President Reagan says it would be
``ridiculous'' to assume that the Nicaraguan Sandinistas will
negotiate democratic reforms without military pressure from the
Contra rebels.
   Reagan on Wednesday reopened the possibility he will ask
Congress to approve new aid for the resistance fighters in the wake
of the collapse of peace talks with the Sandinistas.
   Both Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz hinted
strongly that they'll move for more aid, while Contra leaders met
with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to press their case.

   A bomb planted in a British
army van while six soldiers ran a half-marathon killed them and
injured 10 civilians in the worst Irish Republican Army attack in
Northern Ireland in seven months.
   The bombing Wednesday night in Lisburn, seven miles southwest of
Belfast, brought this year's death toll from sectarian violence to
38 _ eight this week alone.
   Police said the soldiers drove into predominantly Protestant
Lisburn's market square in an unmarked military van to run in the
longest of three races and ``fun runs'' that attracted 4,250
competitors.
   While they were away, guerrillas wired explosives to the van's
chassis. The bomb exploded when the soldiers, returning from the
race around 9 p.m., had driven off just a few yards, police said.

   Colossus, billed as the largest captive
lowland gorilla, got his first glimpse of another member of his
species since infancy, a female on loan for breeding. He apparently
liked what he saw.
   But the match between the 6-foot-2, 570-pound Colossus and 4-8,
274-pound Muke, on loan from the St. Louis Zoo, has a long way to
go before it becomes an affair of the soap opera kind.
   Colossus' encounter with Muke on Wednesday was only a glimpse
through a small opening between their bedrooms at The Zoo in this
Pensacola suburb.
   ``Colossus has been peeking in through that little porthole over

Pat Quinn, director of The Zoo. ``He's very excited about this

   A drought parching much of the country dropped water levels in
the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, making the waterways unnavigable
Thursday and meaning ``major-league'' losses for the inland

Earhart's inner beauty outshined the luster of his Hollywood

   ``She was a fantastic woman who didn't have what we call
charisma. She had an inner loveliness, a gallant nature. She wanted
to prove that women should be as good as men in flight,'' Bresnik,
74, said during an interview Wednesday.
   As part of the Friday's 60th anniversary of Earhart's first

<HEAD>Rumor of Sale of Landmark Cafe in Madrid Causes Stir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumors the Gran Cafe de Gijon in Madrid
might be sold to a British bank rattled coffee cups far beyond the
century-old literary landmark once frequented by the likes of
Ernest Hemingway and Truman Capote.
   Legend has it that the actress Ava Gardner once punched a
photographer there.
   When the rumors spread recently of its possible sale, major
publications rushed into print with what they called the inside
story. Mayor Juan Barranco pledged to preserve the cafe. Part-owner
Jose Lopez de Brito spent a week denying it was for sale.
   ``We are not selling. It is impossible,'' Lopez told reporters
the day reports came out that an British multinational bank, not
identified, had made a $5-million bid for the cafe that first
opened its doors in 1888.
   Although it was before noon, the Gijon was already thick with
cigar and cigarette smoke, and most of its marble-top tables were
filled.
   The Gijon stands just off Madrid's traffic-clogged main
thoroughfare, the Paseo de la Castellana, as a reminder of quieter
days when cafes stretched across the city and coffee time was a
ritual.
   Although its glory days are past and Madrid is much busier in an
economic boom, the Gijon still attracts dozens of ``tertulias,''
groups of intellectuals, artists or retirees who meet once or twice
a week for relaxed conversation with a cigar over coffee and brandy.
   Lopez de Brito said accepting the unidentified British bank's
offer would have broken a pledge made to his grandmother,
Encarnation Fernandez, who bought the cafe from its original owners
in 1913.
   ``Before my grandmother died, she made my father and my aunt
promise not to sell. As long as my aunt is alive we wouldn't even
consider it,'' said Lopez de Brito, who owns the cafe with his four
cousins.
   ``After that, who knows?'' he said. ``The younger generation all
have professional careers. They want their free time. The cafe
doesn't allow that.''
   Grandmother Encarnacion and her daughter, Lopez's Aunt Maria,
presided over the Gijon in the years after the 1936-39 Spanish
Civil War, when struggling actors and writers were drawn to cafes
because of their central heating and cheap admission _ the price of
a tiny cup of coffee.
   By the time grateful artists showered Encarnacion with drawings
and verse on her 100th birthday in 1968, most of them were eating
better, and the Gijon was a grand old survivor, its fame cemented
by the gradual demise of most competitors.
   ``The majority of the cafes were converted into bank branches,
and the literary people took refuge here because there weren't many
places left, '' said Maria's son, Jose Garcia Lopez, who began
working at the Gijon in 1950.
   ``The coffee hour was a bit sacred,'' he said. ``People would
talk about their projects, about bullfights. They generally avoided
politics'' during Franco's 36-year rule.
   Pilar G. Nombrela, who has lived above the cafe for 20 years,
said the Gijon in the late 1960s ``was a classic cafe.''
   ``People would spend three hours over a cup of coffee and talk
about art and literature. There were tables and tables of famous
people. It was incredible.''
   Today, the ``tertulias'' are fewer. At nights, the cafe is
filled with young Spaniards who prefer gin-tonics to brandy. An
armed guard stands inside the door to keep out heroin addicts who
have occasionally robbed patrons at knife point.
   Gentifrication has set in the neighborhood around the cafe and
real estate values have shot up like the skyscrapers along the
Castellana as the Spanish economy marks an annual 5.2 percent
growth rate.
   ``The cafe has changed a lot, just like the country has
changed,'' the 63-year-old Garcia Lopez said. ``In those days,
there were 20 cars circulating in Madrid. Horse-drawn carriages
were used a lot. People worked less and had more time.''
   ``Madrid was a city of cafes,'' he said. ``One writer called it
an archipelago of tertulias.''
   Luis Martin, an octogenarian who has met at the Gijon to chat
with fellow Standard Electric retirees for the last two decades,
does not miss those times.
   ``The bureacrats used to spend all day in the cafes,'' Martin
said, a few minutes before initiating a debate on the merits of
legalizing hard drugs.
   ``When they finally got to the office, all they did was talk
about what they had done in the cafe.''

   The synthesizer sounds just like an
accordion as the band swings into a traditional polka rhythm. Young
women on stage swirl and stomp in step to the music, singing along
in Polish.
   But the women are in miniskirts, the lead singer wears a leather
jacket and the song they sing is not exactly standard polka:
   ``I went out Friday night with you know who _ that babcid with
the size 12 bowling shoe. She feeds me kielbasa and makes me drink
that wine. And then she likes to dance that Love Polka Number
Nine.''
   Irreverent? You bet.
   Offensive? Not to the people on the crowded dance floor bopping
to the beat of The Polish Muslims as they do their version of the
1959 Clovers hit, ``Love Potion No. 9.''
   For six years the group has tried to break into the big time
while building a following as one of the Detroit area's most
popular bar bands. They like to blend standards, chiefly the dance
tunes that put Motown on the map, with parodies celebrating life
among Poles. But at the same time, they retain the music and spirit
of the songs.
   ``Respect,'' ``Nowhere to Run,'' ``Rescue Me,'' ``Come See About
Me'' and ``Doo Wah Diddy'' sound like live versions of the
originals.
   ``It's all for fun,'' said Dave Uchalik, the eight-member band's
33-year-old lead singer. ``We want to come across as a cross
between Poison and Frankie Yankovich.''
   Not so, says guitarist Ken Kondrat: ``We're like `Weird Al
Yankovic' with talent.''
   The Polish Muslims' version of the 1963 Beach Boys hit,
``Surfing U.S.A.,'' is ``Bowling U.S.A.'' The lyrics, revised to
laud the popular sport, mention the two-story alley that served as
an inadvertent backdrop to Pope John Paul II's outdoor service here
last fall.
   ``If everybody had a bowling ball across the U.S.A., then
everybody'd be bowling like at Playdium Lanes. They'd all be
bringing their rosin bags and their numbered shoes . . .''
   They shuffle lyrics to make room for Polish phrases and
references to pirogi, kielbasa, bowling, the Catholic Church _ a
little bit of everything. Prince's ``Let's Go Crazy'' became
``Let's Golambki'' _ a tribute to stuffed cabbage rolls.
   Where an original hit climaxes with a wailing guitar solo, the
band will insert a riff from ``Peanut Polka'' or some other polka
classic.
   ``Our humor doesn't go over anyone's head. We try to stare right
about eye-level _ nothing too subtle or forget it,'' said Kondrat,
30, who like six others in the band is a Catholic of Polish descent.
   In honor of the Polish pontiff, the Beatles' ``Ob-La-Di,
Ob-La-Da'' was rewritten as ``John Paul Two, John Paul One,'' and
Ricky Nelson's ``Travelin' Man'' became ``Travelin' Pope.''
   Their blend of rock and polka puts The Polish Muslims into a
tiny musical subset, according to California record producer Ron
Goudie.
   ``The Polish Muslims are one of eight bands in North America
that is playing rock polka or punk polka,'' said Goudie, who sought
out the bands for ``Polka Is Now,'' a sampler LP to be released
Oct. 7 by Restless Records.
   Goudie identified the genre's leading group as Brave Combo,
which works out of Denton, Texas, and treats polka rock much more
seriously than do the Muslims.
   San Francisco has the 20-piece Polka Side; Los Angeles a group
called Rotondi; Minneapolis boasts The Wallets; Milwaukee, the
Black Holes; Edmonton, Alberta, The Romaniacs; and New York is home
to the all-female polka punk band Das Furlines, whose leader goes
by the name Deb O'Nair.
   ``All these bands play for rock audiences,'' Goudie said. ``They
do rock clubs and punk clubs and weirdo gigs.''
   The most successful bands create original music layered on a
polka base, Goudie said.
   ``The Muslims' `Bowling U.S.A.' is a godhead, but as cool as
those little covers are, they can't make money off them,'' he said.
``They need original material.''
   The problem, he said, is that the original composer collects the
profits when a parody becomes a hit. Of course, that's if the music
publisher gives permission for the parody in the first place.
   ``Bowling U.S.A.,'' to the tune of ``Surfin' U.S.A.,'' which
itself was to the tune of ``Sweet Little Sixteen,'' got the
thumbs-down from Chuck Berry's publishing company, and Michael
Jackson, who owns the rights to ``Dance to the Music,'' wouldn't
let the Muslims record ``Dance to the Polka,'' Uchalik said.
   They got away with recording ``Love Polka Number Nine'' only
because the publishing house failed to answer two letters, he said.
   That record was a self-produced, self-distributed single.
   It was followed up by ``A Yuletide Rock Opera,'' in which the
Gloria chorus of ``Angels We Have Heard on High'' got a heavy bass
line and the word yelled out, letter by letter: ``G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria!''
   For Goudie's compilation, the group wrote an original song:
``That's Why God Invented the Polka.''
   It will be their first national exposure.
   But if the record doesn't catch on, the Muslims will still be
packing them in at Paycheck's Lounge.
   ``There are a lot of real good bands around town that you go to
see and you know they're not making gas money,'' drummer Mike
Miller said. ``We haven't had problems booking anywhere, knock on
formica.''

<TEXT>
   The little girl is so delighted, she cries out
periodically to nobody in particular, ``I'm walkin' with a cane!''
   In Frederick Wiseman's documentary, ``Deaf and Blind,'' viewers
go right along with the girl on her first lesson with the cane as
her teacher helps her negotiate stairways, identify corridors and
search out the cause of a mysterious noise _ a water fountain.
   The four-part series begins tonight on PBS with the first
two-hour installment, ``Blind.''
   Wiseman is probably best-known for his 1967 documentary on the
State Prison for the Criminally Insane in Bridgewater, Mass. Unlike
that ground-breaking film, ``Deaf and Blind'' is no expose. It is
set at the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind in Talladega, a
leading educator of the handicapped.
   Wiseman's cinema-verite style provides an up-close look at what
life is like for students and teachers at the institute. It would
be difficult for anyone who sees the film to look at a deaf, blind
or multi-handicapped person the same way again.
   ``Deaf and Blind'' airs in four parts, each about two hours
long: ``Blind'' tonight, ``Deaf'' on Saturday,
``Multi-Handicapped'' on June 24, and ``Adjustment and Work'' June
25.
   Wiseman has made 20 films about American institutions, including
the Army, a police department, Belmont racetrack and the
Neiman-Marcus department store. He is fascinated by the intricacies
of institutions, and he turns the camera _ operated by John Davey _
on classrooms, field trips, counseling sessions and staff meetings
at the Alabama school.
   There is no narration and little editing, and the subjects of
the filming seem unaffected by the camera's presence. With little
interruption and no outside explanation, the films can get tedious.
But, as Wiseman says in his production notes, ``by placing an
audience in the midst of the enormous complexities of this other
world of the disabled, (the films) attempt to convey some of the
feeling, experiences and attitudes of blind and deaf people toward
their lives.''
   In the opening of ``Blind,'' Wiseman's camera follows the
school's blind band to an appearance at a local stock-car race.
This segment of the documentary is a profound little film in
itself. Wiseman captures the sights and sounds of the racetrack and
intersperses them with highly detailed images of the young people
in their band uniforms gingerly feeling their way out of the
schoolbus, gathering in a little group in the infield while
high-performance race cars whiz by on the track.
   At the institute, Wiseman starts with the youngest children
first. On the playground, an elementary school girl goes down a
slide. Without comment, Wiseman captures her courage, feet dangling
for a beat before she lets go, confidently sliding off into the
unknown.
   In another segment, concerned teachers confer about a difficult
student. Here, as often in the films, Wiseman conveys a sense of
community and caring among the teachers and administrators of the
school.
   The films also reveal that many of the problems handicapped
youngsters have are no different from anyone else's. In ``Deaf,''
for instance, a student's mother has made the long drive to
Talladega from Mobile to meet with a counselor concerned about her
son's displays of anger. After a long discussion, the son finally
reveals he is frustrated at not seeing his estranged father.
   ``He does not love you,'' his mother tells him with the help of
rudimentary sign language. The boy looks at the floor. She tries to
reassure him that his stepfather does love him, and he eventually
hugs her and promises to try to behave better.
   In another segment, young deaf students on a field trip to a
jail are startled when a man in a cell begins signing to them. They
sign among themselves, then begin signing back to the man. It is
times like these when narration would be helpful, because viewers
without sign language skills are shut out of the silent
conversation. But then that itself is an educational turning of the
tables.

   The president of the Alabama Institute
for Deaf and Blind hopes a four-part documentary by filmmaker
Frederick Wiseman will inspire change to benefit the handicapped
everywhere.
   ``I think it will sensitize many Americans to the uniqueness of
the disabled, the frustrations and challenges of the deaf and
blind,'' said Jack Hawkins, president of the institute.
   ``Over the longer term,'' he said, ``the film may make a major
contribution in the professional perception of those who choose to
work in these fields.''
   The series, which has been seen only at film festivals and at
theaters in the New York and Boston area, reaches a national
audience for the first time tonight with the opening installment,
``Blind,'' on public television.
   Wiseman's stark look inside a Massachusetts mental hospital two
decades ago helped transform the care of the nation's mentally ill.
This look inside the institute at Talladega is part of a series of
documentaries on American institutions.
   When he told a friend he wanted to do a film on the disabled as
part of that series, Wiseman explained in a telephone interview, he
was told the Alabama institute was ``one of the best schools in the
country.''
   He filmed for about six weeks at the Talladega complex, which
was founded in 1858 and has grown into a multi-purpose program that
provides kindergarten through 12th-grade academics, competitive
athletics, vocational training as well as special skills training
for the deaf, blind and multi-handicapped of all ages.
   Wiseman said he received ``complete cooperation'' from the
institute and its staff as his camera recorded the anguishing
difficulties and daily personal heroism of the handicapped and
their teachers.
   ``I was impressed by the kindness and compassion,'' said Wiseman.
   In 1967, Wiseman's film ``Titicut Follies'' reported graphically
on the degrading living conditions and dehumanizing treatment of
the mentally ill at a Massachusetts state hospital. The widely
acclaimed film helped draw attention to what amounted to a national
problem as litigation to reform mental health care spread to many
states, including Alabama.
   Wiseman disagees with those who view his work as cause-oriented
filming aiming only to expose one problem or another.
   ``I think that was a bum rap,'' said Wiseman. ``I report on the
experience I had in making the film.''
   He said ``Titicut Follies'' turned out to be ``quite extreme.''
In contrast, he said, the experience at the Alabama institute was
good.
   ``I report on what I find,'' he said.
   Hawkins said he was not aware of the controversial nature of
``Titicut Follies'' when he opened the doors of the Alabama
institute to Wiseman. But even after learning about the filmmaker's
previous work, he said, ``we felt comfortable that our program
could withstand his scrutiny.''
   Hawkins said Wiseman and his crew seemed to become part of the
normal environment. ``They were the most unassuming, unintrusive
and unimposing people I've ever seen,'' he said.
   Wiseman ``recorded the human drama and the boredom of life
itself,'' Hawkins said. ``He did a great job of capturing what
deafness and blindness are all about. We just happened to be the
vehicle for him to use.''

<HEAD>Teri Garr, Pat Morita Headline Comedies on Cinemax, Showtime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable TV has laudably provided a much-needed
outlet for talented comedy writers who would otherwise have to wait
for a rare network television job or big movie deal to get their
work before much of the public.
   But in doing so, cable has also created a new genre _ comedy you
wouldn't actually pay money for but don't mind watching when
there's absolutely nothing else on.
   Two samples of the mediocre are available this month on Cinemax
and Showtime.
   On Tuesday night, Cinemax has ``Cinemax Comedy Experiment: Teri
Garr in Flapjack Floozie.'' It also airs June 23, 26 and 29.
   On Wednesday, three up-and-coming comedians do their standup
routines on Showtime's ``Funnymen: Triple Clowns of Comedy'' with
Pat Morita as host. It can also be seen June 26, 28 and July 1 and
7.
   The three work an easy room, a good-natured suburban crowd in
the Civic Theatre in Hermosa Beach, Calif. At one point they are so
moved by the material, they give a standing ovation to the closing
act, Mark McCollum.
   McCollum, who bounds onstage with his guitar, is a facile
musician and impressionist who almost achieves a Robin Williams
level of insanity, but ends up playing it safe with tired material,
doing Pee Wee Herman and Elmer Fudd impressions and setting amusing
lyrics to well-known tunes _ ``Fever'' becomes an ode to ``Leave It
to Beaver.'' His one-man impersonation of The Who in concert is
rather impressive, though.
   Andy Bumatai, a Hawaiian, also relies on tried-and-true material
_ ethnic jokes. He says he is enjoying California. ``It's fun being
Mexican. ... I can't wait to get to the East Coast. I understand
there I'll be Puerto Rican.''
   Larry Miller, a Robert Klein-like comic who has appeared on
``The Tonight Show,'' suffers from slow timing, but his epic joke
about the ``five levels of drinking _ six if you live in a trailer
park'' is worth the wait. For instance, by level four, he says,
you're saying to yourself, ``As long as I'm only going to get a few
hours of sleep _ I might as well stay up all night! It's good for
me. I don't mind going to that board meeting looking like Keith
Richards.''
   Between acts, Morita offers excruciatingly long, lame jokes that
show why he is a successful actor, not a comedian.
   ``Flapjack Floozie'' on Cinemax is a confusing hodge-podge of
takeoffs, spoofing the obscure musical melodrama genre as well as
the more contemporary spate of celebrity addiction confessions. It
was co-written and directed by former ``Saturday Night Live''
contributor Tom Schiller, who once wrote a short for SNL called
``Java Junkie.''
   The Cinemax film is an ``SNL'' sketch stretched beyond its
limits. To be fair, these ``comedy experiments'' are very
low-budget, and you apparently get what you pay for.
   Garr, one of the best comedic actresses around, is no match for
the silly material. She plays Helen Eagles, a singer who grew up in
vaudeville and somehow got hooked on pancakes as a result.
   A few months ago, Garr was saying that she and Schiller were
working up a comedy short about a woman addicted to sugar.
Apparently they decided pancakes were funnier. They were wrong.
   Flapjacks take over Helen's life after she falls for a gangster
(played by Peter Aykroyd, brother of Dan), who opens the club
Copacapancake as a showcase for Helen.
   After he is gunned down by a rival mobster, Helen buries herself
in shortstacks, until she is committed to the IHOP _ International
House of Psychiatry _ where a sympathetic doctor (John Standing)
attempts to cure her.
   Eventually she's released into the custody of her childhood
nanny (Margie Evans), who has become Aunt Jemima. But on the plane
on the way to her comeback in Hollywood, Helen succumbs to her
lingering addiction and suffers disfigurement in a bizarre pancake
accident.
   ``Flapjack Floozie'' also stars Laraine Newman, Marshall Efron
and Toni Basil and was filmed at the Variety Arts Center, an old
vaudeville theater in Los Angeles. The theater has surely seen
better.

   Elsewhere in television:
   WHITHER MEL AND SUSAN? _ Joan Severance, who played Susan
Profitt, half of the bizarre brother-sister villain act on CBS'
``Wiseguy,'' will have a new love interest in the upcoming movie
``No Holds Barred'' _ wrestler Hulk Hogan. Kevin Spacey, who played
Mel Profitt, meanwhile, is starring Off Broadway in ``Right Behind
the Flag'' and has a movie coming out this summer with Burt
Lancaster. ...
   CBS PLANTES `SUNDAY NIGHT NEWS' _ CBS White House correspondent
Bill Plante has taken on added duties as anchor of the network's
15-minute ``CBS Sunday Night News.'' The newscast was originally
intended to help local stations meet public-affairs programming
requirements, but most stations now have their own local news on
Sunday. Correspondent Susan Spencer has been temporary anchor since
former anchor Charles Osgood took over as anchor on the ``CBS
Morning News.''

<TEXT>
   The bull market of 1982-87 brought lush growth
to the mutual fund industry, creating many new exotic varieties of
funds.
   Now, say some critical observers, it may be time for some
weeding out.
   It was only natural that fund managers would respond to an
investment boom by trying to offer eye-catching new products. But
in so doing, many observers say, they created a lot of confusion
about what funds ought to do and are capable of doing.
   Both managers and investors strayed from the basics on which the
concept of a mutual fund is founded _ investment for the long term
in a diversified portfolio.
   And even some of the new ideas that looked most sensible and
appealing on paper turned out to be ill-conceived.
   In the current issue of his United & Babson Investment Report,
veteran financial adviser David Sargent reports that he recently
participated in an industry panel discussion on the subject:
``Where have all the customers gone.''
   ``My answer was twofold,'' he said. ``First, whenever the market
takes a tumble as it did last fall, the customers always vanish.
But eventually they come back.
   ``Second, and more important, mutual fund buyers have been sold
on promises that can't be met. Performance is the name of the game
these days, and a performance so short term that it is invariably
illusory.
   ``Good investors are lucky enough if they can stay even with the
market. But the fund industry in its offerings leads to the belief
that the market can be beaten, whether in performance or in income
or both.
   ``Thus, investors tend to be sold the fund whose recent
performance is outstanding, rather than the one which has
temporarily lagged. They end up buying high and selling low.
   ``The industry, again in the name of performance, encourages
people to try all sorts of investment gimmickry _ options,
financial futures, junk bonds, sector funds, asset allocation
schemes and the like _ in an attempt to `beat the market.'
   ``Such funds are tough to win with unless one has the investment
skills of a Houdini. Most of us do not.''
   As a case in point of an inventive idea gone wrong, the San
Francisco brokerage firm of Sutro Inc. cited the group known as
option-income funds.
   In theory, there were good results to be had in putting together
a portfolio of investments and enhancing the income on the
investments by selling options on them.
   But in 10 years of actual practice, in a wide variety of market
environments, a composite of five option-income funds has
consistently lagged far behind Standard & Poor's 500-stock
composite index, Sutro analysts note.
   ``The total-return performance, which, after all, is where it
has to pay off sooner or later, has never lived up to its early
promise,'' said Sutro's Robert McIver.
   ``In our opinion, the concept has been given more than enough
time to `work' and it's time to admit that the big mutual fund
format is incompatible with the optimum performance of an option
income strategy.''
   In Sargent's view, ``The funds would be better off, we all would
be, if investors were simply encouraged to buy diversified common
stock funds, with only enough bonds to sweeten the current return
where necessary.
   ``Then they could ride gradually but almost surely to success in
the stock market and have lots left over to leave to their
grandchildren.''

   Silver and turquoise jewelry adorn
Allyssa's tiny hands, and Indian images hang in the small house
across from a shopping mall far from the red stone and open sky of
her Arizona reservation.
   One of the rings is a gift from a Navajo elder at a recent
powwow that 11-month-old Allyssa visited with Rick and Cheryl
Pitts, who have been trying to adopt her since her birth.
   The custody case has split the Navajo Nation. Many in the tribe
sympathized, but others vilified the Pittses and Allyssa's Navajo
mother, Patricia Keetso, who moved in with the couple when she was
pregnant and still lives with them.
   A tribal court granted the Pittses temporary custody of Allyssa
in April and is considering whether to grant permanent
guardianship. A 1978 federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction
in adoption cases of Indian children as a way of preserving the
heritage of the tribes.
   ``I believe in the old traditional ways,'' the elder told the
Pittses. ``But seeing you, knowing how much you love that baby, you
deserve her.''
   Oblivious of the legal tangle, Allyssa plays happily, a child
with two mothers and two cultures.
   She has been blessed by a Navajo medicine man and a pastor of
the Evangelical Free Church. Rather than the earthen-walled hogans
and trailer homes that dot the hot, dry reservation, wood frame and
stucco houses line the streets in the Pittses' busy San Jose
neighborhood.
   ``I think she'll have a better understanding of both worlds,''
said Pitts, who with his wife agreed to take Allyssa back to the
reservation frequently as she grows up and to have her learn Navajo
ways.
   Keetso, 21 and unmarried, is working as a supermarket cashier
but has applied to join the Air Force and says she's eager to start
a new life. The custody fight with her tribe, she says, has been
``like an explosion in my face.''
   Keetso, who has lived away from the reservation most of her life
under a Mormon Church education program, says tribal officials have
criticized her but many Navajos have been supportive.
   She plans to see her daughter regularly, and Mrs. Pitts says
it's all right with her if Allyssa calls them both ``Mom.''
   Keetso met the Pittses through an ad placed by adoption
attorneys in a Navajo newspaper. The ad read, ``Pregnant? We're
willing to help you.'' Keetso wrote to the attorneys, saying she
wanted to give her baby to a family that would provide a good home
and education off the reservation.
   About a week later, the Pittses contacted the same attorneys
about their desire to adopt a baby after Mrs. Pitts had three
miscarriages trying to have a second child and then had a
hysterectomy.
   The birth and Keetso's immediate release of Allyssa to the
Pittses went smoothly, until the tribe intervened.
   Following terms of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, they
notified the tribe that the adoption was pending in a non-Indian
California court. In February, the tribe sought custody.
   The Pittses feared they might have lost Allyssa forever when
tribal officials took her away to Arizona in April. The couple had
given her up at the airport in San Jose on orders from a Superior
Court judge who ruled Indian courts had jurisdiction.
   Allyssa cried as the officials walked away with her and kept her
separated from Mrs. Pitts and Keetso as they flew to Phoenix on the
same plane. From there, they expected to fly with Allyssa and the
officials to Flagstaff. Instead, the Navajos drove off to the
stark, 14-million-acre reservation in northeastern Arizona, leaving
Mrs. Pitts and Keetso frantic about Allyssa's welfare.
   ``I thought giving up the baby was hard, but when the tribe
intervened that was the hardest, especially when they ran off with
Allyssa,'' Keetso says. ``They said I brought shame on the Navajo
nation. But I am ashamed at how they mistreated her.''
   When the Pittses and Keetso next saw Allyssa three days later,
they say she was filthy and running a fever. Child-psychologist
Barry Goodfield said she also was reacting in a way that reflected
stress and fear.
   ``She'd always been a happy-go-lucky baby, and anybody could
hold her,'' Mrs. Pitts said. ``After they took her, she would only
allow me to hold her for quite some time.''
   She added, ``She's pretty much back to normal now,'' and
Goodfield agreed.
   Anslem Roanhorse, director of the Navajo Division of Social
Welfare, denied Allyssa was neglected or mistreated in her stay
with Indian officials.
   He said the baby was taken first to a hospital for an evaluation
and to obtain medication for asthma, then was put in the care of an
experienced foster parent.
   ``We know for a fact that she was not neglected,'' Roanhorse
said.
   The Pittses owe $13,000 in lawyers' fees. Pitts, an independent
building contractor, lost more than $10,000 in income while
fighting to keep Allyssa. Several Hollywood studios have shown
interest in the story, but no deals have been signed.
   In another month or so, perhaps by Allyssa's first birthday on
July 20, the Pittses hope the tribal court will approve their
permanent guardianship petition.
   Even then, Pitts said, ``I don't think the experience we went
through, the emotions it stirred up, will ever be over.
   ``We'll always be reminded of it because we're always going to
campaign against this law, as long as it's being enforced the way
it is, to help anyone else who falls into this unfortunate
situation.''
   The Indian Child Welfare Act was part of an effort to stop the
exodus of thousands of Indian children _ as many as 35 percent of
some tribes' youngsters _ to non-Indian homes after their parents'
rights were terminated by non-Indian courts.
   Welfare agencies, using a non-Indian set of cultural values,
often found fault with Indian child-rearing practices or assumed
life off the reservation would be better.
   Roanhorse compared Indians to endangered species, saying their
future was threatened by the loss of children.
   The Pittses and Keetso don't disagree with the reasons behind
the Indian Child Welfare Act. But they criticize the way Indian
officials handled their case.
   ``I believe they were sincere in their concerns about their
heritage and culture, and we share their concerns,'' Pitts said.
   ``It was our original arrangement with Patricia that she'd be
able to see Allyssa all she wants and we'd take Allyssa out to
visit Patricia's family on the reservation,'' he said. ``That's the
same thing the tribal court said it wanted. If the Indian welfare
people had bothered to ask before they went to court, they'd have
spared all of us a lot of pain.''

   U.S. cardinals meet this month to renew debate
over what to teach Catholics about AIDS. But if the struggles of a
trailblazing religious education director in an affluent Chicago
parish are any indication, the debate goes deeper than the
much-publicized condom furor. AIDS is shaking ordinary
parishioners' deepest religious convictions and raising a central
question: is the church fundamentally about love or judgment?
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Ann Clemens _ nurse, hospital
chaplain, mother of five and Catholic educator _ once wrote a verse
about trying to teach her unusual gospel of AIDS in this affluent
Chicago suburb.
   ``Behold,
   ``The empty chairs and
   ``the quickened pace to run.
   ``Away from me who waits to
   ``Reveal love over judgment,
   ``Knowledge over ignorance,
   ``Healing through reconciliation.
   ``AIDS ministers embrace an EXILED station.
   ``Behold, the empty chairs.''
   For six years, Mrs. Clemens has been director of religious
education at Our Lady of The Brook, a church set on 11 acres of
lush lawns and generous parking lots.
   To most in Northbrook, AIDS is as vague and distant as a foreign
war on the evening news. But in 1986, a friend of Mrs. Clemens
revealed his homosexuality and began drinking heavily because he
feared getting AIDS. Later, she heard from some parents that their
children were trying ``alternative life-styles,'' including
homosexuality.
   Mrs. Clemens came to believe that this conservative, sheltered
parish could no longer ignore the disease.
   She spent 16 months writing an AIDS curriculum expressly for
Catholic parents, ``From Fr-AIDS to Faith: Let Us Talk About
AIDS.'' Told in story form, blending gospel with realism about sex,
drugs and AIDS, it was designed to help parents explain the disease
to their children.
   For fourth- through sixth-graders, for example, there is a
graphic discussion of bodily fluids, how AIDS is and is not spread,
sex and marriage.
   Suddenly this past school year, sleepy suburban Northbrook found
itself an improbable beacon of AIDS education.
   Her parish priest, Sunday school teachers and parents use words
like ``pioneer,'' ``visionary,'' even ``prophet,'' to describe Mrs.
Clemens, who argues that AIDS is a cataclysmic ethical and medical
event that raises centuries-old questions over whether the essence
of Roman Catholicism is love or judgment.
   Despite the outward adulation, however, her AIDS gospel has been
largely ignored. She sent her curriculum to about 400 families in
her parish, but only three accepted her offer for discussions.
   ``Our homophobia is making us deny that the disease belongs to
all of us,'' she said.
   She got brief national attention when she spoke about her
curriculum at the National Catholic Education Association's
convention in New York in April. She was subsequently invited to
address other Chicago-area parishes, but attracted only tiny
audiences.
   The problems she and fellow teachers have found within the
church, in some ways as intractable as the HIV virus itself, are
denial and indifference among parishioners and ambiguity and
division in church policy.
   This month, she decided to leave her parish post to devote all
her time to AIDS missionary work.
   The story of what happened when Mary Ann Clemens tried to get
AIDS discussed in Northbrook tells much about the confusion and
moral contradictions the disease presents for Catholic educators
everywhere.
   ``AIDS,'' said Mrs. Clemens, echoing the sentiments of many
church members, ``is creating havoc for the Catholic church.''
   In one sense, her parish was fertile ground for trailblazing.
The Chicago archdiocese, led by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, is
comparatively liberal. Last December, when U.S. Catholic bishops
issued a landmark statement on AIDS education that included mention
of condoms, Bernardin was a chief proponent.
   The statement drew fire from traditionalists led by New York
Cardinal John J. O'Connor. The nation's 300 bishops have agreed to
meet in Collegeville, Minn., June 24-27 to discuss the issue again.
   Mrs. Clemens, though often critical of what she considers the
church's lack of realism about AIDS, never ran afoul of the
archdiocese. Sister Anne Leonard, director of Catholic Services of
the Chicago archdiocese, and others in the hierarchy have praised
her and her curriculum.
   Her pronouncements have sometimes challenged the bounds of
acceptable dogma, as when she told a gathering of nuns, priests and
lay religious teachers at the convention: ``If a kid tells me he's
sexually active, I give condom information. I'll tell him how to
put it on.''

   The heart of her AIDS message, however, is not condoms but the
Good Samaritan parable, Luke 10:25-37, directing Christians not to
judge their suffering neighbors but to care for them.
   ``Let God do the judging,'' said Mrs. Clemens.
   Meanwhile, Northbrook parishioners were getting mixed signals
from their pastor. Father Robert Herne, who has generally supported
Mrs. Clemens' AIDS mission and who agrees the church should be
compassionate, says it nevertheless should not shrink from calling
a sin a sin.
   Herne wrote some verse of his own in a church bulletin:
   ``What used to be called chastity is now called neurotic
inhibition ... What used to be called perversion is now called
alternative lifestyle. What used to be called depravity is now
called creative self-expression.''
   ``She says God is love,'' Herne said of Mrs. Clemens. ``I say
amen to that. But everything people do is not OK.''
   Herne said he agreed with Mrs. Clemens that the church should
soften its finger-wagging image and the perception it does not
welcome homosexuals who contract AIDS.
   ``We're not against homosexuals,'' said Herne. ``But we seem to
be on the moral side, and less on the compassionate and
understanding side.''
   Mrs. Clemens' work comes as Catholic educators scramble to
devise lessons about AIDS.
   The NCEA has until August to complete an AIDS curriculum for
parochial schools to use in the new school year. It is likely to
discuss, but not condone, condom use.
   The Chicago archdiocese devised its own AIDS curriculum, which
will be introduced this fall. Led by Sister Leonard, the
archdiocese enlisted experts from Northwestern University and
elsewhere to help train parochial teachers.
   Mrs. Clemens contends that Catholic educators hold an untapped
advantage over public schools in their ability to imbue AIDS
lessons with religion.
   ``Jesus tells us a story in Luke that helps us know how to treat
persons who are sick, especially persons with AIDS,'' says her
curriculum, referring to the Good Samaritan story and using
language that would be beyond constitutional bounds in public
schools.
   In talking to children in her parish she discovered it was these
matters of the heart that puzzled them most.
   ``They would ask me, `Why does the school nurse wear rubber
gloves now?' or `What if somebody falls down at school and bleeds.
Can I still help them?'''
   But to most Northbrook youngsters, AIDS remains remote.
   ``I told my kids, `When you go to college next year, how are you
going to know who you're with?''' said Maureen Dondlinger, who
teaches religious classes for teens at Our Lady of the Brook. ``But
the trouble is, AIDS is not here. The kids have a real hard time
connecting to it.''
   Did Mrs. Clemens really expect to succeed?
   ``It wasn't a matter of whether I believed parents would use
it,'' she said. ``I wanted to give them the tools. I feel much
better that parents do the teaching.''
   At least as worrisome as the laity's denial of AIDS, said Mrs.
Clemens, is the lack of thought toward moral and emotional
preparation for parochial teachers being called upon to teach about
AIDS.
   ``You're going to be giving a curriculum to a whole bunch of
volunteer teachers who haven't thought out where they're coming
from,'' she said.
   ``Not every educator should be doing this. If you do not have
the heart for this, please be free enough not to do it. Students
don't want a one-shot filmstrip.
   ``Parents are hungry for a workable sexual theology. The
hierarchy wants to do that, but they are writing from a male
celibate perspective. That's not a criticism. That's a fact,'' she
said.
   John Sloan, who attended Mrs. Clemens' AIDS lessons with his
10-year-old son, Kirk, said he was glad of any help he could get in
explaining AIDS and sexuality.
   ``It's good to have the Church involved in something like
this,'' he said.
   ``I, like other parents, was hesitant to bring up AIDS with my
kids,'' said another parent, Joey Buck. ``Mary Ann took a little
pressure off us.''
   How does Mrs. Clemens feel about the church as she prepares to
leave her parish post?
   ``Love-hate. Sometimes it frustrates me,'' she said. ``The
institution teaches me patience. It teaches me damage control. But
I have hit an institutional wall not only in this parish, but in
this church.
   ``On the AIDS issue, I needed the freedom to speak.''

<HEAD>The Allies Meet With Much to Be Smug About</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leaders of the world's biggest industrial
countries have much to be smug about as they gather here for their
14th annual summit.
   As a result, the meeting of the leaders of the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy is expected
to be long on self-congratulation and short on new policy
initiatives.
   The world economy is performing better than it has in years.
Economic growth is accelerating, unemployment dropping and
inflation remaining under control.
   With that kind of good news, there's a tendency to sweep aside
troubling questions about still-huge trade imbalances, growing
threats of protectionism and enormous Third World debt burdens.
   President Reagan, who will be attending his eighth and final
allied economic summit, said last week that he and the other heads
of state should ``forget about quitting time'' and continue to push
forward on several initiatives aimed at fostering global prosperity.
   But Reagan's colleagues can't forget that the president will be
out of office in seven months and no longer able to carry out any
deals he agrees to.
   Overhanging all of the discussions will be last October's
worldwide stock market crash, which raised the specter of a global
recession.
   The market tumult followed a dispute between the United States
and West Germany over interest rates. The public tiff rattled
financial markets as investors feared that joint international
efforts to support the value of the dollar were coming unglued.
   With the United States now forced to borrow between $10 billion
and $15 billion a month from abroad to finance its trade and budget
deficits, any weakness in the dollar threatens the foreign
financing America has come to depend on.
   The United States and its allies finally settled their policy
differences with a new pledge last Dec. 22 to work closely to keep
the dollar from declining further. Since that time the summit
countries have gone out of their way to play down disputes and
stress how well their drive toward closer economic cooperation is
working.
   There are several successes that they will be able to point to.
   Foremost among them is this: Economic growth is far higher than
economists were expecting in the wake of the stock market collapse.
   Six months ago the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development forecast the industrialized world would
grow at a sluggish rate of 2.25 percent this year. Now the OECD is
predicting world growth will come in at a respectable 3 percent.
Virtually all of the summit nations have seen an acceleration in
business activity.
   Trade imbalances, while still huge, have begun to narrow for the
first time this decade. The United States, which suffered a record
high merchandise trade deficit of $170.3 billion last year, has
seen that imbalance between exports and imports decline to an
annual rate of $141.8 billion in the first four months of this
year, prompting hope that America will be able to lower its trade
deficit this year for the first time since 1980.
   Likewise, the trade surpluses in Japan and West Germany, the
mirror image of the U.S. deficit, have begun to shrink, as both
countries have been successful in boosting domestic demand to take
the place of export-led growth.
   ``There are good numbers all over the place,'' said Michael
Evans, head of a Washington economic consulting firm. ``The world
economy is doing great so the prevailing mood at the summit will be
why bother to change anything.''
   The Reagan administration is doing all it can to play up the
economic successes, planning to use the summit as a pulpit from
which Reagan can preach one last time to other countries the
free-market virtues of cutting tax rates, eliminating government
regulations and turning state-run industries over to the private
sector.
   In a pre-summit interview, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III, the administration's chief economic spokesman, said efforts he
led in September 1985 for greater policy coordination among the
seven summit countries had become firmly entrenched and should last
beyond Reagan's presidency.
   ``We have a coordination process that has been tested by the
adversity of the stock market crash and shown to be effective and
successful,'' he said.
   The main goal of that coordination effort has been to manage the
decline of the dollar, from its heights three years ago, down to a
level where it has rejuvenated American manufacturing.
   Since February, 1987, the summit countries have been striving to
keep the dollar from going lower. That effort did not work last
year as big waves of dollar selling periodically spread panic to
stock and bond markets, culminating in the Oct. 19 crash.
   But after countries took the cooperation pledge again on Dec. 22
and backed up the words with massive joint intervention to buy
dollars, the greenback's fall has been halted. Its value has been
steady for the past six months, the longest period of stability of
this decade.
   The United States will suggest making some minor improvements in
the coordination process, including adding an index of various
commodities including gold as a way the countries can use to judge
whether their monetary policies are threatening to boost inflation.
   Baker first introduced the commodity index proposal last
September to less than enthusiastic response, but he has
successfully lobbied for the plan as a way to add another benchmark
to the indicator process that was launched at the Tokyo summit in
1986.
   Third world debt will also be taken up, with the summit nations
expected to announce a plan to relieve the poorest African
countries of their debts. But the bigger question of how to handle
the huge debt burdens of Latin American countries will likely be
left untouched because of disagreements between the United States
and other countries over the proper approach to take.
   The summit leaders are also expected to tip-toe around the
contentious trade question of agricultural subsidies. Reagan a year
ago at the Venice summit called for an end to all farm subsidies by
the year 2000, but the Europeans oppose such a deadline even though
the farm support programs are costing goverments $200 billion a
year.
   The United States hopes that the final economic communique will
at least lend support to the current round of multilateral trade
negotiations being conducted by the 96 member countries of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

   A massive amount of confidential information
was improperly funneled from the Defense Department to McDonnell
Douglas Corp., a search warrant issued in a nationwide
investigation of possible Pentagon contracting corruption revealed
Thursday.
   The search warrant said the government is investigating the
``bribery of public officials'' in connection with a scheme in
which defense contractors got inside information from former
government officials whom they had hired as consultants.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III declined to give a direct
answer when asked if bribes had been accepted in the Pentagon.
   ``That will all come out in the course of the indictments and
ultimately in the trials,'' he told reporters.
   The fraud and bribery investigation, involving the alleged sale
of information to some of the nation's biggest defense contractors,
drew attention all over Washington.
   President Reagan ``is very concerned'' about the revelations of
the past few days, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after a meeting
that included the president, Vice President George Bush, Meese and
FBI Director William Sessions.
   Reagan instructed them to move ``as rapidly as possible'' to get
the facts.
   Meese said indictments may be handed down in 30 to 90 days.
   Fitzwater said the matter ``certainly poses an internal security
problem.'' He said Reagan ``feels that this is a matter that
deserves his attention and that everyone involved should know of
his feelings, the intensity which he feels about dealing with any
kinds of crimes that have been committed here.''
   Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said about 200 subpoenas had been served this week, some of them on
major defense contractors other than the 15 companies and
consultants whose offices had been searched Tuesday.
   The New York Times, citing unidentified legal sources at the
Justice Department and elsewhere, reported in Friday editions that
the offices of at least three House members had been placed under
investigation as part of the probe. The sources would not identify
the lawmakers whose offices were involved or say who might face
charges in the case, the lawmakers or their aides, the newspaper
said.
   The search warrant that shed new light on the case was unsealed
in federal court in St. Louis. It said Melvyn Paisley, who served
from 1981 to April 1987 as assistant secretary of the Navy for
research, engineering and systems, a key acquisitions post,
provided ``classified and-or confidential'' documents to McDonnell
Douglas.
   Paisley was a key associate of former Navy Secretary John F.
Lehman. Paisley now has numerous defense contractors as clients in
his consulting business.
   Sources also said Paisley is a consultant for United
Technologies, whose Washington offices were searched Tuesday by FBI
agents as part of the fraud and bribery probe. The agents took away
all documents in United Technologies's files relating to Paisley,
said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The agents also took documents relating to the 404 and T-406
engines which Pratt & Whitney, a United Technologies' subsidiary.
Paisley began working as a United Technologies consultant within a
week after he left his Pentagon job last year, according to the
sources.
   The warrant in St. Louis authorized a search of the McDonnell
Douglas office of company executive Thomas Gunn for ``inside
information pertaining to'' the F-16 fighter plane manufactured by
a competitor, General Dynamics Corp.
   Gunn is vice president for marketing at McDonnell Douglas, which
did $7.7 billion worth of Pentagon business in fiscal 1987, making
it the nation's largest defense contractor.
   The fraud case _ culminating two year of undercover work and
wiretaps of the offices of top Pentagon procurement officials _
started coming to light this week when federal investigators served
search warrants on 15 companies and a half-dozen Defense Department
officials.
   Government sources, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said the probe has involved court-authorized phone taps
and bugs at Paisley's consulting office after he left the Pentagon.
   Evidence from the phone tap and the bug on Paisley plus taps on
the phones of two current Pentagon officials, Victor Cohen and
James Gaines, led investigators to the defense contractors and this
week's widespread searches in 12 states. Sources told The
Associated Press the taps on Cohen and Gaines were at their
Pentagon offices.
   NBC News reported Thursday that the court-authorized wiretaps
lasted 290 days and overheard nearly 4,800 conversations, of which
671 were considered incriminating.
   The Washington Post, citing an unidentified law enforcement
source, reported in Friday editions that at least 12 phones had
been tapped, including that of William Galvin, a colleague of
Paisley's and a consultant associated with several defense
contractors.
   The source also said one government employee received more than
$100,000 in cash in return for information, and that investigators
also were looking into allegations that personal bills, vacations
and other expenses of government employees were paid by
consultants, the newspaper reported.
   ``Information that McDonnell Douglas had that was not available
to the contracting public'' included data on the sale of the F-16
fighter to the Swiss government, information from the Navy on the
Super Hornet F-18 and inside information pertaining to General
Dynamics, the search warrant said.
   The warrant also sought a ``proposed letter to McDonnell Douglas
marked `secret''' relating to the F-18, which the company wanted to
sell in Europe.
   In addition, the warrant authorized a search of Gunn's office
for documentation pertaining to the advanced tactical aircraft
program ``and Paisley's efforts to steer it toward McDonnell
Douglas.''
   ``Information about a company's competitors' offers ... is never
disclosed to a company prior to the award of a contract,'' said the
warrant. ``A company which has access to that information prior to
the time when best and final offers must be submitted can benefit
greatly.''
   McDonnell Douglas issued a statement saying that much of the
information sought by the Justice Department ``was information
properly supplied to the company. ... We are not aware of any
improper requests by the company to Mr. Paisley or any improper
activities by Mr. Paisley on behalf of the company.'' The firm said
it is cooperating with the government.
   Gunn issued a statement saying that his work for McDonnell
Douglas ``has been thoroughly proper and legal. Any assertions or
allegations to the contrary are false. I have never ... misused any
information related to McDonnell Douglas.''
   Meese, asked when he was first told by Justice Department aides
of the investigation, said, ``I've been briefed on it some time
ago. I can't remember exactly when.''
   Meese's name turned up on at least one of the court-authorized
wire taps installed as part of the probe, said federal law
enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Because of
that, he was not told of the investigation until late March, after
it was determined by investigators he was not involved in any of
the alleged wrongdoing, the sources said.
   ``We are hopeful that indictments will be completed within the
next 30 to 90 days,'' Meese said.
   Meese said he told Reagan that the investigation ``in no way
reflected on the procurement procedures of the (Defense)
department. It appears that dishonest individuals tried to
circumvent those procedures and that therefore we were taking the
prompt action along with Department of Defense investigators to get
to the bottom of this.''
   Asked how much of an embarrassment the probe was to Reagan,
Meese said:
   ``I don't think it's an embarrassment. Quite the contrary. I
think the fact that whenever you can uncover dishonest activity,
investigate it thoroughly and then take the necessary action, it's
a vindication of good governmental action, to weed out those people
who are taking advantage of the system or committing improper or
wrongful conduct.''
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci has ordered two top officials to form a task force to
monitor developments in the investigation and ascertain if
contracting procedures must be overhauled. Kathleen Buck, the
Pentagon's general counsel, and Robert Costello, the undersecretary
for acquisition, will head the panel.

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
foreign trade widened in the first quarter to $39.75 billion as the
first deficit in investment earnings in 30 years offset a sharp
improvement in the merchandise trade balance, the government has
reported.
   The quarterly imbalance in the country's current account balance
surged 18.6 percent from the fourth quarter's $33.5 billion, the
Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
   The current account is the most important trade statistic,
because it covers not only merchandise trade but also trade in the
services category, which reflects primarily the flow of investment
earnings between countries.

   A boom in the manufacture of business
equipment and a pickup at auto plants helped boost U.S. industrial
production by a moderate 0.4 percent in May, the government says.
   It was the eighth month in a row without a decline in an index
measuring output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities,
and a further sign of the resurgence of U.S. manufacturing.
   The Federal Reserve said Wednesday the May advance followed an
April gain of 0.6 percent, revised slightly from a previous
estimate of 0.7 percent.
   Overall industrial production now stands 6.1 percent higher than

   Optimism about OPEC's extension of its
production-limiting pact proved fleeting in the futures market, as
a one-day rally fizzled.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, lost 30 cents to
settle at $16.53 per barrel on Wednesday.
   The contract had gained 40 cents Tuesday in response to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to extend
its current production quotas for six months.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
dropped 0.30 cent a gallon to 49.23 cents and home heating oil
declined 0.90 cent to close at 43.42 cents a gallon. Both contracts
had advanced along with crude in the previous session.
   ``A lot of questions remain about a rollover agreement (on OPEC
quotas), when the basic agreement wasn't being maintained,'' said
Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Concerns about cheating among OPEC producers resurfaced quickly
in the market when traders failed to follow through on Tuesday's
rally, Baker explained.
   Members of the 13-nation cartel ended their mid-year meeting in
Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday. Their agreement extends what had been
regarded as a nearly meaningless quota system, which limits 12 of
the producers to 15.06 million barrels a day.
   Iraq has refused to sign the accord because it wants a quota
equal to that of its war enemy, Iran.
   Actual daily OPEC production is estimated at 18.5 million
barrels.
   Expectations of tight supplies through the summer helped keep
gasoline prices from losing as much ground as other products in
Wednesday's trading, analysts said.

   Economists say the nation's trade deficit is
shrinking decisively, in spite of a government report indicating
that the broadest measure of trade worsened in the first three
months of the year.
   At first, Wednesday's negative report on the current account
imbalance seemed to contradict the report of a day earlier that the
merchandise trade deficit fell in April to its lowest point since
December 1984.
   But economists said the bad news was old news. In truth, they
said, the United States is well on the way to closing the gap
between exports and imports.
   ``The trade deficit is on the mend in a fairly substantial
way,'' said Thomas F. Carpenter, director of economics for ASB
Capital Management in Washington.
   The Commerce Department sparked a strong rally in the financial
markets Tuesday when it announced that the April merchandise trade
deficit shrank to $9.89 billion, far smaller than expectations.
   On Wednesday, the news seemed to sour when the department said
the deficit in the broadest measure of trade, the current account,
widened in the January-March period to $39.75 billion, up 18.6
percent from $33.5 billion in the last quarter of 1987.
   But financial markets shrugged off the negative report, which
referred to trade news from early in the year that was superseded
by the strong April results.
   Nevertheless, bewilderment over the seeming contradiction
between the numbers was understandable, said Stuart Hoffman, senior
economist of PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh.
   ``It's confusing to economists. The rest of the people must be
that much more confused,'' he said.
   The one dark spot in Wednesday's current account report was that
the United States ran its first deficit in investment income in 30
years during the first quarter.
   The red ink in investment income was the result of foreigners'
accumulations of huge holdings of U.S. assets in recent years. For
the first time, Americans had to pay out more in interest,
dividends and rents to foreigners than they received on their
holdings abroad.
   But the deficit on investment income did not disturb financial
markets, because it was a predictable outcome of the persistent
merchandise trade deficits.
   The investment income deficit is certain to get bigger in coming
months because foreigners will continue adding to their holdings of
U.S. assets as long as they run trade surpluses with the United
States.
   ``We're making progress on the trade front. But because we have
such a large deficit, we're still piling up claims against us at a
very rapid rate,'' said Robert G. Dederick, executive vice
president and chief economist of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   The deterioration in the investment income account will not end
until the United States starts running surpluses in merchandise
trade.
   That is likely to happen around the middle of the 1990s, said
Roger Kubarych, an economist at the consulting firm of Henry
Kaufman & Co.
   Carpenter of ASB Capital Management thinks it could happen far
sooner than that. ``We will start having monthly surpluses within
12 to 15 months,'' he said.

   Campeau Corp.'s plans to sell its profitable Ann
Taylor clothing chain will sever Campeau's ties to the specialty
retailing business, and continue the asset sales needed to help pay
for its recent acquisitions.
   Campeau decided to sell the chain because it has ``different
customers, a different real estate base, a different buying
structure'' than Campeau's nine department store divisions, Joele
Frank, a Campeau spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
   Ann Taylor, with 103 upscale women's clothing stores across the
country, was the last specialty division remaining in Allied Stores
Corp., which Campeau acquired at the end of 1986.
   Last month, Campeau sold Allied's Brooks Brothers chain to help
finance the purchase of Federated Department Stores Inc.
   A source close to Campeau said Allied already has received
interest in Ann Taylor, which had 1987 sales of $249 million.
Campeau did not announce an asking price for the chain.
   Wednesday's announcement came less than a week after Campeau
said it was selling Federated's Filene's Basement specialty store
division. Campeau chairman Robert Campeau also plans to sell two
other Federated specialty chains, Children's Place and Main Street,
as well as its Gold Circle discount store chain.
   Thomas Tashjian, a retail industry analyst with Seidler Amdec
Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, said of Ann Taylor, ``It's actually
a gem.''
   ``It's very unfortunate that he's deleting it from his
portfolio,'' Tashjian said, ``but I can understand from the higher
(real estate) asset value from department stores that he would want
to preserve those and develop that area rather than the
lease-oriented Ann Taylor chain.''
   Analysts have said Campeau, a real estate developer, was
interested in Allied and Federated mainly because of their real
estate holdings. Ann Taylor generally leases its retail space.
   The sale of Ann Taylor leaves Allied with four department store
chains: Stern's, Jordan Marsh, the Bon and Maas Brothers. Most of
Allied's store divisions were sold after Campeau took it over, and
the Brook's Brothers specialty chain was sold after Campeau took
control of Federated.
   Proceeds from the previous sales were use to retire debt from
the $3.4 billion Allied purchase, while funds from the sale of
Brooks Brothers went toward the total $8.8 billion Campeau is
spending for Federated.
   In its announcement Wednesday, Campeau said some of the proceeds
from an Ann Taylor sale also would be used to retire bank loans.
Allied would use the remainder of the money to purchase shares in
Federated, which in turn would use the funds to further reduce its
own debt.
   Allied and Federated will be operated under the same management
but will remain separate legal entities, Campeau said.
   Campeau has said it expects to retain Federated's
Bloomingdale's, Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Burdine's, Abraham and Straus
and Rich's department store chains, as well as its Ralphs
supermarkets division in California.
   Goldsmith's and Rich's have been merged into a single division.

   Business hours will be around the clock for
planned radio networks based in Boston and Colorado.
   Boston-based Business News Broadcasting Inc. is signing on
stations for a 24-hour satellite feed of business and financial
news scheduled to begin Oct. 1 on the AM band, which has been
losing listeners steadily to FM stations in recent years.
   In Colorado Springs, Colo., Business Network Radio Inc. is
planning to enter the market next month with a mix of business news
and general features.
   ``There's a huge appetite out there for business news,'' said
John H. Knowles Jr., one of the five BNB founding partners. ``We're
targeting the people at the top of the pyramid with the highest
business acumen.''
   Knowles said about 15 stations around the country had signed
agreements to take either full 24-hour broadcasts or partial
reports. The network will have about 25 editorial and 20 sales and
executive employees at its Boston headquarters and its offices in
New York city and Washington, D.C.
   ``Right now, much of the AM band is wasteland,'' said Knowles.
``We think there is a strong niche we could fill.''
   Demographics, not numbers of listeners, will draw advertisers to
BNB, said Knowles, who describes the projected BNB listener as a
upper-level executive with at least a $15,000 investment portfolio.
   ``There are about 3.5 million people who fit in that category,''
he said. ``We're not even going to get 10 percent of them. But the
advertisers should recognize that this is a very attractive
market.''
   Among the other founders and investors who put up nearly $1
million over the past two years are Fred Walters, a former exective
editor at WINS all-news radio in New York, and Jim Hood, former
Associated Press deputy director of broadcast news operations.
   Business Radio Network Inc. plans to begin broadcasting in
between 12 to 15 markets on July 4, said Roger Petrik, vice
president and chief financial officer.
   Petrik said more than 100 stations had expressed interest in BRN
and the company had secured about $1 million in financing for its
first three months of operation.
   News director Eric Burch estimates 80 percent of the format will
be business-related, including mangement and investment tips and
farming news. The company plans to place staffers or stringers in
more than 60 major cities worldwide, he said.
   ``It's the wave of the future,'' said Burch. ``It will be
everything from hard-line features to what Lee Iacocca eats for
breakfast.''
   The nation's first all-business station, KMNY in Los Angeles,
also is planning to syndicate its programming in August. After 14
months on the air, KMNY has about 1 percent of the Los Angeles
market.

<HEAD>Forecaster Expects 8.4 Percent Growth in Ad Spending This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic advertising spending should rise 8.4
percent this year, its strongest showing in four years despite some
unexpected weakness in local retail advertising, a widely followed
ad forecaster says.
   Robert Coen, senior vice president for the ad agency
McCann-Erickson Inc., said Wednesday that total U.S. ad spending
should rise to $118.8 billion.
   His forecast of 8.4 percent growth this year was slightly below
his December prediction that spending would rise 9.0 percent in
1988, but it still exceeds rises of 7.4 percent in 1987, 7.8
percent in 1986 and 7.9 percent in 1985.
   ``The Olympics and the elections are helping to fuel a return to
a higher growth rate for U.S. ad spending in 1988 after a
three-year drought,'' he told securities analysts at his semiannual
briefing on ad spending trends.
   It would be the biggest gain since ad spending rose 15.8 percent
in 1984, another year that also had the Olympics and presidential
election.
   He said many large national marketers appear to have ``loosened
their tight grip on budgets'' but are spending significantly more
only ``when bargains or special considerations justify the
increases.''
   National advertising is expected to rise 9.4 percent to $66.35
billion, Coen said, while local ad spending will grow 7 percent to
$52.47 billion.
   In the new forecast, Coen said national ad spending on
television should rise 10 percent, the first double-digit rise in
four years.
   The forecast includes a projection of an 11 percent rise in
spending on the three major television networks. Network executives
have complained in recent weeks that the national ad market has
softened.
   Magazine ad revenue has risen 11 percent over the first four
months of the year, but should slow and finish 8 percent ahead for
the year, he said.
   The biggest adjustment in Coen's forecast came in his estimates
of newspaper ad spending. He said spending by local retailers, a
major source of newspaper ad revenue, rose only 1 percent in the
first quarter. He said the weather and worries about takeovers may
have made some large retailers more cautious about spending.
   As a result, Coen said he scaled back his growth estimate for
local ad spending in newspapers to 6 percent from 9 percent.
   Among the major ad categories, Coen said automakers boosted
their spending on television and magazines by 18 percent in the
first three months of the year, while makers of food, candy, soft
drinks and cleaning products posted double-digit spending gains for
the first time in several years.
   On the other hand, he said, cigarette advertising in magazines
fell 6 percent in the quarter, and single-digit gains were posted
by beer and airline companies.
   Outside the United States, Coen said he expects ad spending to
grow 14 percent to $108.4 billion in 1988. That would mean
worldwide ad spending would rise 10.9 percent to $227.2 billion.
   Coen said he tentatively expects U.S. ad spending to rise 7.5
percent to $127.7 billion in 1989. He said while the economy and
profits are growing, many advertisers traditionally tighten ad
budgets in a post-Olympic year.

   International Business Machines Corp. will offer
up to 50 percent more bang for the buck next week when it announces
a new generation of computers for the vital center of its product
line, a new report says.
   The introduction Tuesday of the new mid-sized computers will be
``one of the most important in IBM's history,'' Dataquest Inc., a
San Jose, Calif.-based market researcher, predicted Wednesday.
   IBM is locked in a struggle with archrival Digital Equipment
Corp. for domination of the middle range of computing, and both
companies have been rushing products to market.
   The new family of computers will succeed IBM's System 36 and
System 38, which are the world's biggest-selling computers above
the ranks of personal computers.
   The existing machines are the workhorses for thousands of small
and medium-sized businesses. They also are used as departmental
computers in some big corporations, a niche where Digital has done
especially well.
   Although the rivalry constantly is see-sawing, ``We expect this
announcement to radically alter the balance in the mid-range'' in
IBM's favor, Dataquest analyst Allan Baumgartner said.
   The new computers have been code-named Silverlake and Olympia
and will be unveiled as the AS-200 and AS-400 series, ranging in
price from $30,000 to more than $300,000, Dataquest says.
   While the System 36 and System 38 are distinct machines that run
different software, the new computers all will run the same
software, although some older programs will have to be modified to
run on them, analysts say.
   There are already nearly 300,000 members of the System 36-38
family installed worldwide, and over the next five years the new
computers could raise the total to 700,000 systems with a value of
more than $50 billion, Dataquest said.
   IBM's share of worldwide mid-sized computer shipments by
U.S.-based companies slid to 23.6 percent in 1987 from 27.2 percent
in 1984, while Digital's rose over the same period to 18.9 percent
from 15.2 percent, according to International Data Corp.
   Each percentage point represents nearly $300 million in annual
sales, so the battle for market share is intensely fought.
   ``It will be probably the broadest announcement that IBM has
ever attempted,'' in terms of the number of customers who will be
affected, said Robert Djurdjevic, an IBM watcher who is president
of Annex Research Inc. in Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``The big news is that IBM is going to make the mid-range market
exciting again, win or lose,'' said Donald Bellomy, an analyst for
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
   ``If Silverlake doesn't take back some market share, then it
will be a failure,'' Bellomy said.
   Digital and other computer companies are hoping to pick off some
IBM customers during the transition by convincing them to switch to
their products instead of trading up to the new IBM computer.
   ``If a customer's running out of capacity, they'd be doing their
corporation a disservice not to look at Vax,'' Digital's product
line, Gary Hoppe, Digital's manager of U.S. sales consultants, said
in an interview.
   The competitors' job will be easier if it is expensive and
difficult to move software from the old computers to the new
ones.IBM has promised that the new line will protect ``nearly all''
of customers' investments in applications software, but it has not
been more specific.
   IBM should be able to hang onto customers as long as it has done
a respectable job of providing continuity to the new products,
Annex Research's Djurdjevic predicted.

<HEAD>Centerre Accepts Boatmen's Buyout Offer Of $467 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centerre Bancorporation has accepted a $60 a
share stock swap merger offer worth about $467 million from
Boatmen's Bancshares Inc., Missouri's biggest bank holding company,
the companies announced Wednesday.
   Centerre, which in April had announced a $37 a share stock swap
merger agreement with Mercantile Bancorporation Inc., in May
received a counter-offer of $50 a share, or a total of about $390,
from Boatmen's.
   Boatmen's later that month raised its offer to $55 a share.
   ``Our board carefully considered various merger and acquisition
alternatives and concluded that Boatmen's offer was in the best
interest of Centerre shareholders,'' said Clarence C. Barksdale,
Centerre's chairman and chief executive officer.
   All three bank holding companies are based in St. Louis.
   If the acquisition is completed, the statement said, Boatmen's
will become the nation's 41st largest bank-holding company, with
assets of about $14.7 billion and a trust business worth $33
billion.
   The proposed acquisition is subject to approval by the
shareholders of both companies and by the appropriate regulatory
authorities.
   Barksdale and John Peters MacCarthy, president of Centerre, will
become vice chairmen of Boatmen's, the statement said. Centerre
Trust Co. will continue to operate as a separate subsidiary as
Boatmen's Trust Co. with the ultimate objective of consolidating
all trust functions, it said.
   As of March 31, Boatmen's had assets of $9.59 billion and
Centerre, the state's fourth largest bank-holding company, had
assets of $5.12 billion.

   Bargainers for the United Auto Workers and
General Dynamics Corp.'s Land Systems Division reached a three-year
contract settlement late Wednesday night, averting a midnight
strike at the defense contractor.
   The two sides put the finishing touches on a settlement covering
6,000 workers that includes a drug testing program UAW Vice
President Marc Stepp said would be mutually satisfying to the union
and the company.
   Details of the tentative agreement were not immediately
released, although Stepp said it included a substantial pay
increase and a ratification bonus, along with improvements in
health and safety provisions.
   ``Overall we were very happy,'' Stepp told a late night news
conference. ``We dealt with the substance abuse matter. Our members
will agree to that I'm quite sure.''
   Stepp said the contract would be explained to the workers
represented by the UAW at the Land Systems Division, a tank-making
operation that General Dynamics bought from Chrysler Corp. in 1982.
The division has plants in the Detroit suburbs of Sterling Heights
and Warren and at Scranton, Pa., and Lima, Ohio.
   About 1,000 of the division's workers are on layoff.
   A ratification vote will take place in another seven to 10 days,
the union said.
   The union had sought a 3 percent-per-year increase in the
$13-an-hour base wage at General Dynamics and increased union
representation to help workers with benefit questions, Stepp said.
   Stepp said the company sought to reduce the number of job
classifications, or strict definitions of individual jobs, and more
flexibility in its use of workers.
   Stepp said earlier that drug abuse was not a widespread problem
in General Dynamics plants.
   General Dynamics and the union have a pilot Employee Assistance
Program at the Detroit Tank Plant in Warren. Like similar programs
at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler, the
professionally administered program uses counseling and education
to help workers with drug and other problems.
   Stepp said the union wants the EAP expanded to other Land
Systems Division plants.
   General Dynamics was required to accept Chrysler's UAW contract
when it purchased the Land Systems Division, and a contract
negotiated in 1985 closely resembled Big Three auto contracts.
   Talks on a new three-year contract began April 11, Stepp said.

<HEAD>Way Cleared For Reorganization Plan</HEAD>

   A federal appeals court has given Allegheny
International Inc. approval to file a bankruptcy reorganization
plan.
   The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia also said that
management may count votes cast at a shareholders meeting next week
and announce the results immediately.
   The court, which handed down its ruling Tuesday, previously had
said the appliance maker could do none of those things without
court permission.
   Allegheny International spokesman Edward Romanoff said
management plans to file a reorganization plan by the end of the
month, but he declined to specify whether the filing would precede
a shareholders' meeting June 20, when votes are to be cast for
board seats.
   ``The sooner the company emerges from Chapter 11, the stronger
it will be,'' Chairman Oliver S. Travers said Wednesday.
   Under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, a company is
protected from its creditors while it reorganizes.
   Management and a shareholders group, led by the New York
investment firm Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, are fueding over how to
allocate the company's resources in satisfying its obligations.
   The dissident shareholders group is also challenging management
for control of the board. Seven seats, a majority, are open.
   Irwin L. Jacobs, the company's largest shareholder, said
Wednesday that he is siding with the investment banking company in
its bid to take control of the board. The previously uncommitted
Jacobs heads an investor group that owns 9 percent of Allegheny
International's 10.8 million common shares.
   Separately, Victor Kiam, chairman of Remington Products Inc.,
said Wednesday he told Spear, Leeds & Kellogg he would be
interested in helping them form a reorganization plan for Allegheny
International.
   Kiam, who has been involved in reorganizations of several
consumer products companies, said he would meet with Allegheny
International's management if invited, said Remington spokesman
William Cavior.
   Allegheny International owns Sunbeam, Oster and other appliance
and leisure products companies.

<HEAD>UAW, General Dynamics Contract Contains Drug Testing Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A tentative settlement reached between the
United Auto Workers union and General Dynamics' Land Systems
Division is one of the first major labor contracts to contain a
drug-testing policy, a union official says.
   The settlement, covering 6,000 workers at Land Systems Division
plants in the Detroit suburbs of Sterling Heights and Warren, and
at Scranton, Pa., and Lima, Ohio, was announced less than 20
minutes before Wednesday's midnight strike deadline.
   ``We dealt with the substance abuse matter in a manner that is
satisfactory to us. Our members will agree to that I'm quite
sure,'' UAW Vice President Marc Stepp told a news conference. ``All
in all we are very happy.''
   Stepp said the contract's approach, one of the first of its
kind, ``deals with the rehabilitation aspects'' of drug abuse and
will not mean that any workers will have to submit to random or
mandatory drug testing.
   Earlier Wednesday, Stepp said the union would not agree with the
company's demand for random, mandatory drug testing. He said
details of the program have to be worked out, then explained to
workers along with the rest of the contract. He said members would
vote within the next seven to 10 days.
   Company officials were equally as pleased with the agreement on
drug testing.
   ``As we all know, it's a national problem,'' said Arch Rambeau,
corporate vice president for human resources. ``It is involved in
every community where we live. It's in every work place. We need to
start with education and rehabilitation programs.''
   General Dynamics and the union have a pilot drug program at the
Warren plant, which uses counseling and education to help workers
with drug problems.
   Other parts of the contract include a substantial pay increase
over the three years of the contract, along with a ratification
bonus and improved health and safety provisions, Stepp said.
   About 1,000 of the workers covered by the tentative agreement
are on layoff, including 800 of the 2,700 Detroit-area workers.
Stepp and Rambeau declined to discuss specifics of how the contract
will impact those workers, if at all, and also said they could not
provide other specifics until union members are informed.
   Rambeau, however, said lump sum wage increases are included in
the contract, as the company had wanted, but he would not elaborate.
   The union sought a 3 percent pay increase for the base wage of
$13 an hour in each year of the pact. It also sought increased
union representation to help workers with benefits questions, Stepp
said.

<HEAD>Delors Says Farm Policy Dispute Could Spoil Toronto Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-European dispute over farm
policy reform may ``spoil the atmosphere'' of next week's
seven-nation economic summit, a senior European official said
Thursday.
   Jacques Delors, chief executive of the European Economic
Community, said a ``divergence of views'' remained between
Washington and the EEC over how to reduce government support for
agriculture.
   ``This ... could well spoil the atmosphere'' of the summit that
starts Sunday in Toronto, Delors told a news conference at EEC
headquarters.
   Delors and other senior officials of the EEC executive
Commission will represent the 12-nation trade bloc at the Toronto
meeting, which will be attended by the heads of government or state
of the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy
and Japan.
   Delors said he expected no major new initiatives to emerge from
the meeting.
   At last year's seven-nation economic summit President Reagan
unveiled a proposal for phasing out government subsidies to farmers
by the end of the century. The EEC has rejected the idea, saying it
supports coordinated cuts in subsidies but that some government aid
will always be necessary to properly manage farm markets.
   Last fall the EEC proposed what it called ``short term''
measures aimed at easing immediate problems of overproduction of
sugar, grain and other crops. The United States has criticized this
approach.
   Farm reform is a central theme of the current Uruguay Round of
international trade liberalization negotiations being held under
the auspices of the 93-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
   Delors also said discussions of key economic and trade issues at
Toronto would be made more difficult by the fact that Reagan will
soon leave office and the U.S. presidential election contest is
heating up.
   ``This will make discussion of the outlook for the world economy
in 1989 and 1990 a little bit more difficult,'' Delors said, adding
that it also would hamper discussion of the GATT trade
liberalization talks.
   Delors said he would be explaining to his summit partners the
EEC's new protocol agreement with the Soviet-led economic bloc, the
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The protocol, in which the
East bloc group extends formal recognition to the EEC for the first
time, is to be signed by leaders of both organizations on June 25.

<HEAD>Weyerhaeuser Co. Rejects Union Contract Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weyerhaeuser Co. has rejected a union
contract proposal in the midst of a strike against three other
Northwest timber companies, according to a union official.
   A Weyerhaeuser counterproposal was inadequate, Bill Hubbell,
president of the International Woodworkers of America, said
Wednesday.
   Hubbell said no further talks were scheduled with the Tacoma,
Wash.-based company, but negotiating subcommittees will meet in the
next few days to discuss proposed changes in Weyerhaeuser's
profit-sharing plan.
   Weyerhaeuser has about 7,500 union employees.
   About 4,500 union workers have been on strike since June 6
against Willamette Industries Inc., Champion International Corp.
and DAW Forest Products Co. in Oregon, Washington and Montana.
   The woodworkers' union and the Western Council of Industrial
Workers called the strike after the companies rejected a contract
accepted earlier by Eugene-based Bohemia Inc.
   The Bohemia contract reportedly provides a 5 percent raise in
the first year and 4 percent in each of the following three years
of the contract.
   The Weyerhaeuser counterproposal calls for a 4 percent increase
in base pay over four years, Hubbell said. The company also offered
improvements in its profit-sharing plan.
   ``We're absolutely miles apart on base rates as it relates to
the Bohemia settlement,'' Hubbell said.
   Company spokesman Lee Bjorklund declined to comment on details
of Wednesday's negotiations, but described them as constructive.
``Both parties acknowledged the need for considerable discussion of
detailed issues,'' he said.

   Cattle farmers are sending cows to
slaughter and mowing roadside ditches to feed remaining animals
trying to survive one of the region's worst droughts since the Dust
Bowl. Crop farmers, meanwhile, can only wait.
   ``Everybody is culling every cow that they don't need. You're
seeing a lot of older cows going to market,'' said Malcolm
McGregor, a Nashua farmer and regional vice president of the
National Cattlemen's Association.
   In northeast Iowa on Wednesday, Vernon Kuhn worked in his
withering fields, which yielded 50 bushels of soybeans per acre
last year.
   ``If we get 35 an acre, we'll be tickled to death,'' he said.
``We need a week of rain.''
   Elsewhere in the nation's midsection and Southeast, farmers
turned to sometimes desperate measures to help relieve the drought
that's prompted widespread water conservation and threatened farm
yields, sending prices zooming on commodity exchanges.
   ``We get a daily report (on the drought) each day and I must say
most days since early May anyway those reports have not been
good,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said today on CBS-TV's
``This Morning.''
   Asked if the situation was developing into a potential disaster,
Lyng replied: ``Emphasizing the word potential, yes, that's
correct. The major corn belt area, this is the most reliable
farming area in the world ... is threatened. It's a serious
matter.''
   Speaking on the same program, the American Farm Bureau's Terry
Francl said: ``We are reaching a critical phase over the next week.
If we do not have rain, that means there'll be substantial
reductions in yields.''
   But weather forecasters continued to bear bleak news after a dry
winter followed by a parched spring.
   ``It's going to be dry across the Plains and the upper Midwest
at least the next couple of days,'' Hugh Crowther, of the National
Weather Service in Kansas City, Mo., said today.
   In Clyde, Ohio, florist Cliff Doebel spurned traditional
forecasting science and invited Leonard Crow Dog, a Sioux medicine
man from South Dakota, to perform an Indian rain ritual.
   ``Crow Dog will use prayers and offerings to appeal to the four
winds of the Earth to bring the rain to Sandusky County,'' Doebel
said.
   Water levels on the Mississippi reached record lows, meanwhile,
stranding at least 750 barges. Twice that many could become mired
by the weekend, equaling ``a traffic jam of semi-trucks bumper to
bumper from New Orleans to Philadelphia (Pa.),'' said Michael
Logue, spokesman for the Vicksburg District of the Army Corps of
Engineers.
   Despite predictions of scattered showers and thunderstorms
today, forecasters see no significant relief for Iowa and the rest
of the Corn Belt.
   The area from Missouri to Ohio should get below-normal rain in
the next month, while dry conditions should ease with above-normal
rains in the South and southern Plains states, according to a
forecast by the weather service and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   On Wednesday, prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn and
oats rocketed to their daily trading limits within seconds of the
opening bell at the Chicago Board of Trade, a reflection of Lyng's
gloomy assessment the day before.
   Lyng, calling the drought a potential national disaster, said
damage already had been done to wheat fields in Montana and the
Dakotas and that additional dry weeks of scorching temperatures
could cause severe damage in the Corn Belt and across the South.
   ``If you got hay to sell, you can get whatever (price) you can
ask. ... There just isn't any,'' said Al Luetmer, a Minnesota dairy
and grain farmer.
   McGregor, who recently attended a cattlemen's meeting in Denver
on the drought, said farmers in North Dakota and eastern Montana
have been forced to sell productive livestock to meatpackers
because of parched pastures and rising feed prices.
   Iowa's not far behind, he said. Meanwhile, cattlemen here are
trimming their herds.
   ``I don't see any liquidation yet, but it will be soon if we
don't get any rain,'' he said. ``There's certainly nothing growing
up here.''
   The USDA has allowed farmers in 96 of Iowa's 99 counties to feed
cattle on land originally left out of row crop production under the
federal set-aside program. A similar measure was taken in Missouri.
   ``The decision to allow haying and grazing on diverted acres was
a lifesaver for us,'' said Dorothy Tisdale, who has a herd of 70
beef cows on the farm she operates with her husband, Fred, near
Milton.
   Gov. Terry Branstad this week ordered the Iowa Department of
Transportation to allow farmers to mow ditches along roads near
their property and feed the hay to livestock.
   Farmers of row crops like corn and soybeans, meanwhile, are
still holding out for rain to salvage 1988 yields, despite one of
the worst droughts since the 1930s' Dust Bowl.
   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, who played ``Gopher'' in TV's ``The
Love Boat,'' toured farms in his northwest Iowa district last
weekend.
   ``I saw stressed corn,'' he said Wednesday. ``The farmers
weren't quite concerned yet, but everyone said 10 days could make a
difference between having a serious condition and a critical
condition.''

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. and a Saudi Arabia-owned oil company
today announced an agreement in principle to form a join venture
for refining, distributing and marketing oil products in the U.S.
East and Gulf Coast regions.
   The venture, in which each side will hold a half interest valued
at $800 million, will maintain exclusive use of the Texaco
trademark for marketing gasoline, diesel fuel and home heating oil
in the 23-state region, a jointly released statement said.
   It said an agreement in principle forming the venture had been
signed by officials of the White Plains, N.Y.,-based oil giant and
Aramco Services Co., the Houston-based subsidiary of the Arabian
American Oil Co., also known as Aramco.
   Saudi Refining Inc., and Aramco Services Co. subsidiary, will
hold half interest in Texaco's refining assets and marketing system
in 23 eastern and Gulf Coast States, as well as the District of
Columbia, the statement said.
   The assets in queston will include three major Texaco
refineries, located in Delaware City, Del.; Convent, La.; and Port
Arthur, Texas, in addition to 49 terminals, about 1,450 owned and
leased service stations and a branded distributor network of more
than 10,000 stations, it said.
   Saudi Refining will provide 75 percent of the venture's initial
inventory, or about 30 million barrels of crude and products, and
each side will pay in half of the net working capital. A barrel is
the equivalent of 42 gallons.
   ``By sharing the inventory and working capital, Texaco said it
expects to achieve approximately $2 billion in cash benefits and
savings from the formation of the joint venture based on current
oil prices,'' the statement said.
   Although it has been known for some time that Texaco and Saudi
Arabia had been negotiating this deal, Texaco had indicated that it
had been held up by Saudi reluctance to sign, until it knew whether
financier Carl C. Icahn's attempt to buy Texaco would be successful.
   Earlier this year, the nation's third-largest oil company
announced that it would pursue joint ventures such as this as part
of the restructuring plan bringing it out of Chapter 11
bankruptcy-court protection.
   The company sought that protection while it was engaged in a
multibillion-dollar legal dispute with Pennzoil Co. That dispute
was resolved with Texaco's agreement to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil.
Texaco emerged from bankruptcy court protection in April.
   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
was reported by the Saudi Press Agency as describing the move as
``an important step in the kingdom's continuing program of
cultivating oil industry marketing.''
   The joint venture would provide the kingdom with ``a guaranteed
utility for marketing Saudi crude oil and a good opportunity for
the kingdom to take part in a profitable commercial venture in a
country with a large marketing potential,'' Nazer said.
   Under the agreement announced today, the venture would have the
right to buy up to 600,000 barrels of crude daily from Saudi Arabia
at prevailing market prices.
   The partnership said it anticipated ``no significant changes in
operations or staffing levels at the Texaco facilities involved,
and no changes in the products and services provided to customers.''
   The formation of the joint venture is subject to further
approvals by the Saudi government and Texaco's board, as well as
various U.S. governmental regulatory bodies.
   It is expected to be completed by the end of this year, the
statement said.

   The stock market fell sharply today, erasing
much of the gains posted in the previous two, record-setting
sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which struggled to
reach its second consecutive post-crash high Wednesday, was off
24.36 points at 2,107.04 in the first half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.06 million shares. Losers
overpowered gainers by about 11 to 3 with 241 up, 886 down and 377
unchanged as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Market watchers attributed the decline to softness in the bond
market.
   ``Let's face it, it's the rates that call the turn,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``The whole stock market turns on rates.''
   A pull-back in stock prices has been anticipated since the Dow
has climbed more than 200 points in recent weeks. Analysts are not
overly concerned by the decline and contend that the market needs a
breather.
   Separately, another ``triple-witching hour'' looms on Wall
Street, with groups of stock-index futures, stock-index options and
options on individual stocks due to expire on Friday. Analysts are
reluctant to predict what effect this quarterly phenomenon might
have on the market.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down ] at 49{. The oil
company, which will face off against Carl Icahn it its annual
shareholders meeting Friday, announced a joint venture with a Saudi
Arabian oil company.
   Zenith was off [ at 27. The International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers union proposed Wednesday to acquire part of the
company through an employee stock ownership plan.
   IBM was off 1\ at 117|, Chrysler was down | at 24{ and Philip
Morris was down } at 83{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.70 at 152.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   Chrysler Corp. says it will close its Newark,
Del., assembly plant for about 16 weeks to perform major
renovations that will lead to the production of four-door Dodge and
Plymouth sedans.
   The changeover, scheduled to begin Friday, is the final phase of
a $536 million program to begin production of A-body cars, Chrysler
said Wednesday.
   The plant, which made the K-body Plymouth Reliants and Dodge
Aries, employs about 2,000 hourly workers. About 400 people will
work during the changeover, while the remaining 1,600 will
participate in training sessions on robotics, programmable
controllers and several computer systems, Chrysler said.
   The majority of the workers will be gradually phased back into
their jobs as the plant progresses toward full production, Chrysler
spokesman Doug Nicoll said.
   The 36-year-old Newark plant is the seventh Chrysler assembly
plant to undergo extensive modernization and conversion to
state-of-the-art, high-technology manufacturing since the 1984
model year.
   K-car production will continue at the company's Jefferson
Assembly Plant in Detroit before it is moved to Mexico at year's
end.

<HEAD>Stocks Up, Retail Sales, Industrial Production Rise</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs on business inventories and sales; picks
up 2nd graf pvs, A late spurt ....</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose a moderate 0.5 percent in April as
business sales slackened somewhat from March's torrid pace, the
government said today.
   The build-up of inventories was about in line with expectations,
and economists had expected sales to retreat after two strong
months.
   The Commerce Department said inventories rose $3.6 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $723.7 billion, while total business sales fell
0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $478.8 billion.
   On Wednesday, stock prices edged to new post-October crash highs
as the government reported increases in May retail sales and
industrial production and a widened first-quarter deficit in the
broadest measure of U.S. foreign trade.
   A late spurt in buying on Wall Street pushed the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials up 6.93 points on Wednesday to 2,131.40,
its second post-crash high in as many days. The blue-chip stock
indicator climbed 25.07 points Tuesday.
   Before the market opened, the Commerce Department said retail
sales rose 0.1 percent in May to $131.9 billion after a 0.4 percent
drop in April.
   The sales gain was restrained by a 1.2 percent fall in
automotive sales.
   Excluding autos, retail sales rose 0.5 percent in May. Sales of
expensive durable goods expected to last three or more years were
down 0.6 percent, while non-durable goods sales rose 0.5 percent.
   In another report, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production rose 0.4 percent in May, the eighth consecutive increase
in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities.
   The May advance followed a revised 0.6 percent rise in April,
initially estimated at 0.7 percent. With the latest growth, overall
industrial production now stands 6.1 percent higher than it was a
year ago.
   In the trade report, the Commerce Department said the deficit in
the broadest measure of U.S. foreign trade widened to $39.75
billion in the first quarter as the first deficit in investment
earnings in 30 years offset a sharp improvement in the merchandise
trade balance.
   The imbalance in the country's current account balance from
January through March surged by 18.6 percent from a fourth quarter
total of $33.5 billion.
   The current account is the most important of all the trade
statistics because it covers not only merchandise trade but also
trade in the services category, which reflects primarily the flow
of investment earnings between countries.
   The report said the services category went from a fourth quarter
surplus of $12 billion to a deficit of $655 million in the first
quarter of this year, the first deficit in the investment category
since 1958.
   The report on the current account came a day after another trade
report showed the deficit in merchandise shipments narrowed to
$9.89 billion in April, the smallest monthly deficit since December
1984.
   The current account figures showed a similar decline in the
merchandise trade deficit. In the first quarter, it dropped 12.7
percent to $35.95 billion, the best improvement in five years.
   But the services deficit added $655 million to this figure and
another $3.15 billion was added by U.S. foreign aid payments and
Social Security benefits paid to American retirees living overseas.

   The stock market fell sharply today, erasing
much of the gains posted in the previous two, record-setting
sessions, as equities mirrored a plunge in bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which struggled to
reach its second consecutive post-crash high Wednesday, was off
21.16 points at 2,110.24 in the first hour and a half of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 57.71 million shares. Losers
overpowered gainers by about 5 to 2 with 370 up, 940 down and 413
unchanged as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Market watchers attributed the decline to disarray in the credit
markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in a West
Germany newspaper that indicated the central Bundesbank might be
tightening monetary policy.
   ``There are some indications that Japan might be doing the same,
and that says effectively that if the Federal Reserve wants to keep
the dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room to
decline,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at Frist Albany
Corp.
   ``Everybody is picking up on its cue,'' he said.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue was off more than a
point, or more than $10 per $1,000 in face value at midmorning.
   ``Let's face it, it's the rates that call the turn,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``The whole stock market turns on interest rates.''
   A pull-back in stock prices has been anticipated since the Dow
has climbed more than 200 points in recent weeks. But analysts
called today's decline jolting.
   ``In the last two days, the market's performance has been
impressive,'' Johnson said. ``This just points out what thin ice
we're on.''
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down | at 49\. The oil
company, which will face off against Carl Icahn it its annual

<TEXT>
   Time runs slow on Ole Man River these
days but the money's running out fast, as the 50 towboats in
position to nudge 750 barges up the Mississippi sit stranded in
record-low water levels caused by drought.
   Officials fear that up to 1,500 barges could become stranded by
the weekend, equaling ``a traffic jam of semi-trucks bumper to
bumper from New Orleans to Philadelphia (Pa.),'' Michael Logue,
spokesman for the Vicksburg District of the Army Corps of Engineers.
   ``Nobody knows for a fact how long we will be here,'' said James
Burkett, a pilot with the towboat Charles F. Detmar, Jr., stuck
near this Mississippi Delta town. ``Some of the boats have been
here for three days _ at least three days.''
   The low river levels have created bottlenecks in places such as
Vaucluse Landing, Ark., about three miles north of the Greenville
Bridge, where the river is down to nine feet.
   Prospects of ending that bottleneck brightened today.
   ``Late yesterday afternoon, our navigation people were able to
mark a secondary channel at Greenville that we didn't know
existed,'' Michael Logue, a spokesman for the Army Corps of
Engineers in Vicksburg, said today.
   ``Since we found the secondary channel, it looks like the small
tows will be able to go ahead and pass. The larger tows will have
to wait,'' he said.
   While tugboat owners are losing an estimated $10,000 a day in
expenses, their crews are spending the time painting, performing
light maintenance and even fishing.
   ``There's plenty of work, there's always something to do,'' said
Steve Southern, a first mate on the John M. Donnelly, a northbound
towboat pushing 30 barges north.
   The continuing drought throughout the Midwest and Southeast has
brought the Mississippi to its lowest levels for this time of year
since Mark Twain chronicled life on the Big Muddy and officials
began chronicling river levels in 1872.
   The low water has forced barges to operate only during daylight
and to lighten their loads, said Jeffrey Smith, vice president of
the American Waterways Operators in Arlington, Va.
   ``Low water _ since the days of Mark Twain _ has been an
occupational hazard, and they know how to deal with it. Things are
somewhat restricted, but cargo is still moving,'' Smith said
Wednesday.
   Mississippi River barges carry such cargo as grain, petroleum,
chemicals, iron and steel, he said.
   Barges with light loads wait here to be escorted one by one by a
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers channel patrol boat. In all, about 50
towboats were stranded Wednesday along with their charges,
approximately 750 barges, officials said.
   The towboats, which displace more than 9 feet of water, were
stranded in about 9 feet or less as they waited for the corps
dredge Jadwin to arrive today to widen the channel.
   The Jadwin will take at least a day, and possibly two, to dredge
the channel to a depth of 16-20 feet and allow the barges through,
officials said.
   The drought has been good news for some, however.
   Waterways Marine, which takes orders by radio and delivers
supplies to towboats passing by, has been doing a brisk business
since the boats became stranded, said the company's general
manager, James Ashmore.
   In addition to food and housekeeping supplies, Ashmore said, he
is also selling a lot of fuel because many boats are keeping their
engines running.
   Towboat owners are losing money because, in addition to food,
fuel and salary expenses, they get paid per ton-mile, and every
lost day is lost tonnage that could be delivered, Ashmore said.
   The river gauge at Vicksburg, about 70 miles south of
Greenville, read 2.5 feet Tuesday. The lowest level ever recorded
was minus 7 feet in February 1940, when much of the upper river was
frozen, said Ron Goldman, chief of water control management for the
corps district.
   Ashmore said some pilots are resorting to ingenious methods to
try and get through what has become an increasingly narrow and
shallow channel near Greenville.
   One pilot radioed Ashmore to ask if he could unload most of the
fuel from his tanks to make his boat light enough to get through.
Ashmore, however, said he wasn't able to help the pilot.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
sharply higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with corn
prices for near-term delivery rocketing up the daily trading limit
for the third consecutive day on dry-weather fears.
   The exchange expanded corn price limits from 10 cents to 15
cents a bushel on Wednesday _ the second day of limit gains _ in
accordance with its rules. The higher limit will remain in effect
at least through Monday.
   Most oat futures also opened up their daily limit of 10 cents a
bushel. Some soybean contracts surged their 30-cents-a-bushel limit
at the opening, but prices fell back on reports that the Reagan
administration would consider limiting soybean exports if the
drought in the Grain Belt continues.
   ``That goes without saying _ they're going to have to reduce
exports if we have a smaller crop,'' said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Scattered showers brought relief to isolated sections of
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana on Wednesday, and there is a chance
of rain in the Midwest this weekend. But the National Weather
Service on Wednesday predicted below-normal rainfall for the region
in the middle and latter portions of next week.
   In early trading, wheat was 2} cents to 8 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.91 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 15 cents higher with July at $2.94{ a bushel; oats were 5 cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.89\ a bushel; soybeans were 8
cents to 24 cents higher with July at $9.44 a bushel.
   Most cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .50 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at
69.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.50 cents lower across the
board with August at 70.27 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower
to .80 cent higher with June at 48.45 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .72 cent lower to 1.78 cents higher with July at 43.75
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed sharply lower on Wednesday.

   Interest rates headed higher as bonds plunged in
value in early trading today, reflecting widespread concerns about
possible hikes in rates overseas, a weak dollar and inflation.
   Long-term issues took the biggest hit. The yield on the
Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped to 8.94 percent from
8.83 percent late Wednesday, while it fell 1\ point in price, or
$12.50 per $1,000 in face amount.
   Prices of U.S. securities started out lower overseas and that
carried over into domestic trading following an unconfirmed report
from a West German newspaper indicating that country's central bank
might be tightening monetary policy.
   The report said the Bundesbank would raise its securities
repurchase rate, a key interest rate, one-quarter percentage point
to 3.5 percent.
   ``It is possible,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York.
   He noted that a high-ranking Bundesbank official recently
indicated that his country was concerned about inflation due to
better-than-expected economic growth in West Germany and a rise in
money supply. At the same time, the West German mark has been weak
against the dollar in foreign exchange, and the Bundesbank has
intervened on several occasions by selling dollars to buy marks.
   Tightening credit through a hike in interest rates would keep
West German inflation in check and also support the mark, Brusca
said.
   Carol Stone, a senior economist at Nomura Securities
International Inc., said U.S. bond traders were concerned that
Japan might also be tightening policies, especially as its economy
continues to grow, and that could carry over to the United States.
   Adding a negative tone to the U.S. markets today was a decline
in the dollar in foreign exchange and another rise in commodity
prices, both of which heighten concerns about inflation, Ms. Stone
said.
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities, such as
bonds and notes.
   By midday today in the secondary market for Treasury bonds,
prices of short-term government issues fell between \ point and ]
point, intermediate maturities ranged from { point to } point lower
and long-term issues declined between 1 3-16 point and 1\ point,
according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.65 to 110.03. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood
at 1,152.22, down 6.71.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities fell nearly a
point in light trading, according to the investment firm of Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, lost 1.21 to 283.93.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were up 2 basis points to
6.35 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 6 basis points to 6.60 percent and one-year
bills were up 8 basis points at 6.91 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 7 7-16 percent, down from 8\ percent late
Wednesday. The key rate had risen in Wednesday's session on
technical factors.

   Texaco Inc. chieftains and Carl C. Icahn, the
company's largest shareholder, come to their showdown Friday as the
last ballots are cast in a proxy fight that could lead to the
biggest corporate buyout in American history.
   But the winner won't be known for weeks. It is expected to take
that long to sort out the proxy ballots.
   Icahn, holder of 14.8 percent of Texaco's 243 million shares, is
running with four allies for the five seats up for election to the
company's 14-member board.
   He is seeking the seats to pressure the company to let
stockholders vote on his offer to buy the Texaco shares he does not
already own for $60 each, or about $12.4 billion. Adding the $1.2
billion he already paid for his stake would raise the acquisition
cost to $13.6 billion, the biggest sum ever paid in a corporate
buyout.
   Two weeks ago Icahn said if he lost, he would sell his stake and
``go away,'' but in recent days he said he might try a hostile
takeover bid.
   Voting has been going on since late May and ends officially at
Texaco's annual meeting Friday in Tulsa, Okla.
   In the last hours, it was widely believed there was no clear
front-runner. Several major institutions were reported to have cast
their votes for Icahn, while others were said to be leaning toward
Texaco. Traditionally, individuals tend to vote for management, but
various sources said it was impossible to assume anything this time.
   On Wall Street, Texaco shares have traded near $50 a share,
reflecting the market's skepticism that Icahn will be able to pull
of the deal.
   The annual meeting will bring to a head the latest phase of a
months-long war of nerves, invective, lawsuits, charges and
counter-charges between the nation's third largest oil company and
the wily takeover artist.
   Texaco said that Ichan tried to force Texaco to buy out his
stake for an above-market price, a practice known as greenmail, and
that he tried to manipulate its stock. Icahn called the allegation
a ``fairy tale,'' and said Texaco offered to pay him greenmail but
he refused.
   Icahn, in turn, argued that Texaco's management
``misappropriated'' corporate assets in California. Texaco called
the charge a ``complete fabrication.''
   Both sides have lawsuits pending against the other.
   Icahn begain buying up Texaco shares last fall, while the
company was struggling to overcome a $10.3 billion judgment held
against it by Pennzoil Co.
   Pennzoil won the judgment when a jury ruled Texaco had
improperly interfered with Pennzoil's deal to acquire part of Getty
Oil Co., then bought Getty itself. The ruling ultimately led to
Texaco's filing for bankruptcy court reorganization in April 1987.
   A December agreement by Texaco to settle with Pennzoil for $3
billion was the keystone of the reorganization plan ultimately
approved by the court in April. But not without stiff opposition
from Icahn.
   He battled against Texaco's management to strip antitakeover
provisions from its charter.
   Amid increasing acrimony, he accused Texaco management of
``getting itself into this multibillion-dollar mess,'' then seeking
to entrench itself at the shareholders' expense.
   In turn, Texaco President James W. Kinnear and other top
executives accused Icahn of seeking to bolster his own profits at
the expense of Texaco's other stockholders.
   Icahn lost some of those battles, but won some others, at times
with support from shareholders equally unhappy with the company's
performance _ and particularly with the bankruptcy filing, which
resulted in the suspension of its dividend for one year.
   As a result, Texaco agreed to include a vote on certain
``corporate governance'' on the proxy ballot, including, among
others, restrictions on the adoption of takeover defenses, an
anti-greenmail provision and more participation by shareholders in
choosing directors.
   It also talked up its restructuring plan, a major feature of
which was sales of $3 billion worth of underperforming assets.
   But that was not enough for Icahn.
   In February he announced his intention to run his five-man slate
for the board. At the time, Texaco's stock was selling near $38 a
share.
   Icahn offered to withdraw his slate, if management took more
steps to raise Texaco's stock price. With an eye to restless
stockholders, management restored the $3 annual dividend and added
an additional $2 billion in proposed asset sales.
   It also struck back in early May, accusing Icahn of violating
federal securities laws and asking a federal judge to bar him from
using his stock against the company.
   Weeks of peace talks ensued, as Icahn sought to find a way to
dispose of his stake without depressing Texaco's price at the same
time.
   After Texaco broke off the talks on May 25, he announced his
buyout offer, which put a $14.6 billion value on the company.
   But Texaco refused to let shareholders vote on the proposal,
prompting Icahn to launch his proxy fight.

   The FBI bugged the office and tapped the phone
of a former Pentagon official as part of the government's massive
investigation of defense fraud, government sources said today.
   At the White House, meanwhile, President Reagan met with top
Justice Department and FBI officials to stress his desire for ``a
full and thorough investigation as rapidly as possible,'' his
spokesman said.
   The bug and wiretap were at the office of defense contractor
consultant Melvyn Paisley, who from 1981 to April 1987 was
assistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineering and
systems, a key acquisition post under former Navy Secretary John F.
Lehman. Paisley now has numerous defense contractors as clients.
   The sources were confirming a report in today's editions of The
Washington Post.
   At the White House, Reagan met with the government's top law
enforcement officials, including Attorney General Edwin Meese; FBI
Director William Sessions; Edward Dennis, new head of the Justice
Department's criminal division, and U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson of
Virginia, along with top White House aides, including counsel
Arthur Culvahouse.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described Reagan as
``very concerned,'' and added:
   ``We can't go into any details of the investigation in terms of
the discussion or what they told the president. But suffice to say
everyone wants to pursue this with the utmost vigor and
determination.''
   Fitzwater said the matter ``certainly poses an internal security
problem'' and told reporters that Reagan ``feels that this is a
matter that deserves his attention and that everyone involved
should know of his feelings, the intensity which he feels about
dealing with any kinds of crimes that have been committed here.''
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said later that Carlucci had
ordered two top officials to begin forming a special task force
that would monitor developments in the investigation and ascertain
if contracting procedures must be overhauled.
   Howard said Kathleen Buck, the Pentagon's general counsel, and
Robert Costello, the under secretary for acquisition, would head
the panel.
   In St. Louis, a search warrant unsealed in federal court said
Paisley provided ``classified and-or confidential'' documents to
one of his clients, McDonnell Douglas Corp., on contracts being
sought by the company. In two of those contracts, worth billions of
dollars, McDonnell Douglas is competing against General Dynamics
Corp., which has its headquarters in St. Louis County.
   On Tuesday, federal agents searched the office of a McDonnell
Douglas executive as part of the probe of alleged bribery and fraud
in defense contracting. McDonnell Douglas was served with a search
warrant, along with 14 other defense contractors, and 38 search
warrants were issued Tuesday and Wednesday in 12 states.
   According to the search warrant unsealed in U.S. District Court
in St. Louis, part of the scheme involved the illegal disclosure of
confidential or classified information and the ``exertion of
influence'' on Defense Department contracts.
   The search warrant alleges that former Pentagon officials bribed
current government employees to get the information, then gave it
to defense contractors who had hired the former officials as
consultants.
   The investigation of McDonnell Douglas appears to center on
Thomas Gunn, vice president of marketing for McDonnell Aircraft
Co., and Paisley.
   The warrant says Paisley gave McDonnell Douglas and Gunn
``substantial information obtained from government officials which
has been classified and-or confidential or not available to the
contracting public.''
   The warrant said agents were looking for evidence of bribery of
public officials, violations of conflict-of-interest laws, theft of
government property, fraud and conspiracy.
   Gunn's was the only office at McDonnell Douglas's headquarters
in St. Louis County to be searched, according to the warrant. Items
seized in the search of Gunn's office included calendars, card
files, computer discs, memos, status reports and video cassettes.
   The FBI also placed a court-authorized wiretap in the office of
Victor Cohen, the civilian official responsible for buying tactical
battle command, control, communications and computer systems for
the Air Force, sources speaking on condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press.
   A court-authorized tap also was installed in the office of James
Gaines, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for acquisition
management, international programs and congressional support, said
the sources.
   Federal investigators armed with evidence from the wiretaps,
hich have been in place for much of the two years of the probe, are
preparing to approach witnesses who now may be cooperate with the
government's massive Pentagon purchasing fraud probe.
   The probe has turned up ``rampant bribery in the government''
and includes allegations of cash payments, purchase of cars and
payments of bills for government employees, Sen. John Warner said
Wednesday.
   The government is now preparing to approach people whose voices
are recorded on the taps and who are implicated in possibly illegal
acts, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``They're going to confront them with the tapes and see who they
can flip'' into becoming government witnesses, one source said
Wednesday.
   The White House said Wednesday that President Reagan was among
many top government officials who were not told in advance of the
probe.
   Meese was not told of the investigation until late March because
his name came up on one of the wiretaps, the Post reported today,
citing unidentified sources for the information.
   Warner, ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said
there were many cases where companies ``paid $500 or $1,000 to a
government employee for proprietary information and then went out
and sold it for $50,000.''
   Warner made the statements in comments inadvertently recorded as
he spoke to committee chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., prior to a
congressional hearing.
   One warrant sought information from two offices at Cubic Defense
Systems Inc. in San Diego, Calif., about a sophisticated electronic
pilot training system used by the Air Force and Navy, said William
C. Stewart, vice president and general counsel at Cubic Corp.
   Stewart said the company used a consultant, William Galvin of
Washington, whose office files also were searched in the probe.
   Government sources said federal investigators also tried to
question two Cubic employees who had spoken with Cohen, but were
told by company lawyers not to do so.
   Search warrants were served on at least six current or former
Pentagon employees.
   Among the offices searched was that of George Stone, an official
in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. Stone is director
of the information management services and information transfer
purchases division.
   A warrant also was served on Jack Sherman, a civilian employee
in the Marine Corps. Sherman works in the equipment and service
acquisition section of the contracts division, installation and
logistics department at Marine Corps headquarters.
   Another Pentagon employee whose files were searched, Stuart
Berlin, works for the Naval Air Systems Command, the prime
contracting office for aircraft-related procurement. Berlin is the
head of the ship systems engineering branch.
   Knight-Ridder reported that the search warrant for Berlin's
office sought information about his relations

   The U.S. dollar declined against the major
currencies in European trading Thursday, mainly because of
uncertainty over why the West German central bank was selling
dollars. Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the Deutsche Bundesbank sold about
$210 million Wednesday and Thursday. They said there were rumors
the bank will increase money market interest rates next week,
making the West German currency more attractive.
   In London trading, British pounds were more expensive for buyers
at $1.7900 dollars, up from $1.7848 late Wednesday.
   Other late rates in Europe compared with Wednesday's late rates,
included: 1.7505 West German marks, down from 1.7535; 1.4580 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4675; 5.9005 French francs, down from 5.9137;
1.9650 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9690; 1,299.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,300.62; and 1.2160 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2170.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.98 Japanese yen, down
from 126.32 late Wednesday. In London late Thursday, the dollar
traded at 125.65 yen and dealers said the dollar's fall against the
German mark was the main reason for the decline.
   Gold bullion prices were mixed, moving higher in London and
lower in Zurich.
   Traders said their market was nervous and prices fluctuated
throughout the day in a narrow range, underpinned by rising
commodity prices in the United States because of drought but
weakened by lower oil prices.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $452.80 a troy ounce, up
from Wednesday's late $452.60. The closing price in Zurich was
$452.50 bid, down from $453.
   After the gold market in Hong Kong was shut for a holiday
Wednesday, gold closed there Thursday at $454.52, up from $452.58
Tuesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $7.21 a troy
ounce, up from $7.14.

<HEAD>Americans Say New Tax Law Less Fair Than Old Statute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Americans questioned in a recent
survey say the tax law that went into effect last year is less fair
than the old statute, the Conference Board said Thursday.
   The results of the poll indicate public opinion about the tax
law has become more negative now that it has been in effect for
more than a year.
   The 5,000 households questioned in the survey were asked how
fair they felt the new law was, regardless of how it affected them
personally.
   Fifty-three percent said they felt the new law was less fair
than the old law, while 14 percent said they were fairer, and 33
percent said they saw little change from the old law, the
Conference Board said in a statement.
   The results contrast with a survey taken after the new law was
passed in 1986. At that time, one-third of the respondents said the
statute was less fair, the business research organization said.
   The most dissatisfaction with the new law came from upper-income
households, those with incomes above $50,000 a year. In that group,
62 percent said the new statute was less fair, 15 percent said it
was fairer and 23 percent said they saw no change.
   Forty-six percent of the overall respondents in the latest
survey said their taxes have gone up since the new law was
implemented, while 36 percent said their taxes were the same and 18
percent said they were lower.
   Among upper-income respondents, 63 percent reported their taxes
were higher, 21 percent said they were the same and 16 percent said
they were lower.
   The survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 1
percent, was conducted for the Conference Board by National Family
Opinion Inc., based in Toledo, Ohio.

   The stock market tumbled lower today as equities
mirrored a plunge in bond prices and erased much of the gains
posted in the previous two, record-setting sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which struggled to
reach its second consecutive post-crash high Wednesday, was off
26.67 points at 2,104.73 at mid-afternoon.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 114.52 million shares. Losers
led gainers by about 11 to 5 with 438 up, 992 down and 475
unchanged as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Market watchers said the decline was triggered by disarray in
the credit markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated
report in a West Germany newspaper that indicated the central
Bundesbank might be tightening monetary policy.
   ``There are some indications that Japan might be doing the same,
and that says effectively that if the Federal Reserve wants to keep
the dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room to
decline,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at Frist Albany
Corp.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue was off 1\ points, or
$12.50 per $1,000 in face value at midday.
   ``Everybody is picking up on its cue,'' Johnson said. The dollar
also fell in value.
   ``Let's face it, it's the rates that call the turn,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``The whole stock market turns on interest rates.''
   A pull-back in stock prices has been anticipated since the Dow
has climbed more than 200 points in recent weeks. But analysts
described today's drop, which was exacerbated by profit-taking, as
jolting.
   ``In the last two days, the market's performance has been
impressive,'' Johnson said. ``This just points out what thin ice
we're on.''
   Analysts fear a crack in the confidence that has been building,
but lower stock prices also could bring out some bargain hunters.
   ``We would use any weakness as a buying opportunity,'' one
trader said.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down ] at 49{. The oil
company, which will face off against Carl Icahn it its annual
shareholders meeting Friday, announced a joint venture with a Saudi
Arabian oil company.
   General Electric was off ] at 43[. The company said it will
acquire Borg-Warner's chemical division for $2.31 billion in cash.
   Elsewhere, Deere Co. was off 2 at 46}, Philip Morris was off }
at 83{, and Hewlett Packard was off } at 52{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.63 at 153.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 1.34 at 307.44.

   Share prices fell Thursday on the London Stock
Exchange as equities followed Wall Street lower, giving market
players an opportunity to sell and take some profits.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 7.4 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,861.9.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down
20.09 points at 2,111.31 as the London trading session drew to a
close, after opening about 12 points lower.
   London dealers said their market moved into negative territory
during the afternoon as it became evident that Wall Street was
heading lower, pressured by a swift decline in U.S. bond prices.
   Analysts said it was not suprising to see such a technical
correction in bond prices after their sharp gains over the past
several weeks.
   Dealers said major market players were resuming their cautious
stance, as inflationary fears were thought to be creeping back into
the market.
   One equity analyst with London stockbrokerage Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd. said the market still is not convinced that it is on a
stable footing.
   ``It's far too early after the (U.S. April) trade figures to say
we've seen the bottom of the bear market and there are plenty more
factors for Wall Street to take account of,'' he said.
   A barrage of British economic data unsettled the market, raising
fears that the economy may be growing too quickly for its own good,
analysts said.
   The British Treasury reported that the public sector borrowing
requirement, the most widely used measure of Britain's government
deficit or surplus, showed a surplus of 624 million pounds in May,
down from a revised surplus of 1.129 billion pounds in April.

<TEXT>
   Stuck in Moscow's Red Square without a red cent?
   Keep your shirt on comrade.
   In the spirit of ``glasnost,'' American Express Co. announced
Thursday that it has been granted permission to operate the
first-ever cash-dispensing automated teller machines in the Soviet
Union.
   Two American Express ATMs will be installed by September in
central locations in Moscow, providing American Express cardmembers
with 24-hour access to the company's dollar travelers checks or
Russian rubles, the company said.
   American Express said the ATM agreement was the result of two
years of negotiating with the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of
the U.S.S.R., a central bank for foreign interests that operates 18
retail branches in the Soviet Union and aleady offers some American
Express financial services.
   The Soviet bank will be responsible for daily business
transactions while it will act as a consultant, American Express
said.
   ``The appeal of the U.S.S.R. as a tourist destination is rising
and ... there are exciting changes afoot within the country,'' said
American Express President Louis V. Gerstner Jr.
   Juergen Aumueller, president of American Express travel-related
services in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the joint
venture ``confirms the current favorable climate of East-West
cooperative business arrangements.''
   The Soviet Union has been slowly expanding in the business world
after years of centralized bureaucratic controls over banking and
finance that have been partly blamed for economic stagnation in
recent years.
   It was only last December that citizens were permitted to open
checking accounts at banks. And just three months ago Visa
International said it was given sole permission to issue credit
cards to foreign residents and Soviet citizens who travel abroad.
   Many prominent Soviet citizens, though, have held credit cards
for a number of years, including Soviet leader Mikkhail Gorbachev's
wife, Raisa, who reportedly carries an American Express card when
she travels abroad.

   The stock market tumbled today, mirroring a
plunge in bond prices and wiping out gains posted in the previous
two, record-setting sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which struggled to
reach its second consecutive post-crash high Wednesday, was down
37.69 points at 2,093.71 an hour before the closing bell.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 139.77 million shares. Losers
led gainers by about 3 to 1 with 388 up, 1,105 down and 442
unchanged as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   While the Dow was off the entire session, the key index fell
through the psychologically important 2,100-point level in
mid-afternoon. Analysts had hoped that the Dow was solidly above
the mark and that it would serve as a floor for a further advance.
   Market watchers said the decline was triggered by disarray in
the credit markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated
report in a West Germany newspaper that indicated the central

<HEAD>Japan's Economy Grows 4.9 Percent In Fiscal 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's muscular economy, shrugging off the burden
of a strong currency, grew faster in the first three months of 1988
than at any time since 1977, according to figures released Thursday.
   Boosted by personal spending and housing investment, the economy
grew 2.7 percent in the January-March period after adjustment for
inflation, the Economic Planning Agency said.
   That came to an unusually robust annual growth rate of 11.3
percent, the fastest since the January-March period of 1977, when
the annual growth rate was 11.7 percent, records show.
   Although growth rates tend to fluctuate erratically from quarter
to quarter, economists said the increase was nevertheless an
impressive sign of strength.
   The first three months of 1988 represent the final quarter of
Japan's 1987 fiscal year. Growth for the entire fiscal year came to
4.9 percent after adjustment for inflation, more than in the United
States and Western Europe, the agency said.
   A year ago, economic planners were worried that the soaring
value of the Japanese yen would drive the economy into a recession
by making Japanese exports too expensive for foreign purchasers.
   Instead, the value of the yen stabilized and Japanese companies
found ways to cut costs and keep their prices competitive in world
markets.
   ``It is easy for many Japanese exporters to overcome this yen
increase. Now they're feeling very comfortable, exporting many
goods to not only the United States but many Asian countries and
European countries,'' said Yoshihisa Kitai, a New York-based
economist for the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
   At the same time, the economy has become less dependent on
exports because of a government-fueled expansion of the domestic
economy. The government has provided easy credit and undertaken a
multitrillion-yen housing and public works program.
   The 1987 real growth rate of 4.9 percent topped the government's
revised target of 3.7 percent for real growth _ that is, growth
after adjusting for the effects of inflation. The government
predicted real growth of 3.8 percent in fiscal 1988.
   Officials said personal spending, which normally accounts for
about 55 percent of Japan's gross national product, rose 4.0
percent in fiscal 1987 from a year earlier.
   Housing investment rose by 23.9 percent and industrial equipment
investment rose by 10.1 percent, both compared with fiscal 1986,
the official said.
   Housing investment softened at the end of the fiscal year.
Housing starts in January, February and March were up 2 percent
from a year earlier after a string of double-digit increases.
   However, consumer spending in the quarter was strong. An
additional shopping day in February helped boost consumer spending,
said Shingo Unami, an economist for Yasuda Trust and Banking Co.
   Japan's growth outpaced the growth in the 1987 calendar year of
2.9 percent in the United States, 4.8 percent in Britain, 1.7
percent in West Germany, 2.2 percent in France and 3.1 percent in
Italy, but trailed the growth of 12.0 percent in South Korea,
officials said.

<HEAD>Report: Bundesbank to Raise Key Interest Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German financial newspaper
reported Thursday that the Bundesbank planned to raise a key
interest rate next week, although the central bank had no comment
on the report.
   The article in the daily Handelsblatt disturbed the U.S.
financial markets, where stock and bond prices fell sharply on
fears that American interest rates would rise also.
   The newspaper said the Bundesbank decided at its Wednesday
policymaking meeting to increase the securities repurchase rate,
which is the rate the central bank pays to trade in securities in
the open market, a quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent.
   The West German central bank has kept the rate constant at 3.25
percent since Nov. 24 of last year as an indication of its policy
of stable interest rates and ample money-market liquidity.
   A Bundesbank spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny
the rate hike report.
   However, a top West German banking official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said several developments have made the
situation ripe for an increase.
   He listed those developments as a rise in interest rates in the
United States and other countries, a widening gap between German
long-term and short-term rates, a climbing dollar, and a weakening
West German mark.
   Another official, Deutsche Bank economist Martin Huefner, said
the Bundesbank's hike in the ``repo rate,'' if implemented next
week, wouldn't necessarily cause criticism from its partners in
Europe or overseas.
   To brake the dollar's recent rise, either the United States has
to lower its interest rates or West German interest rates have to
go up, Huefner said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of corn, oats and soybeans closed
sharply higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade while wheat
futures plunged on fears of a reduction in export sales.
   The three corn contracts for 1988 delivery advanced the limit
for daily trading for the third consecutive session as dry
conditions prevailed in the parched Corn Belt. The Board of Trade
expanded its daily price limit for corn from 10 to 15 cents a
bushel Thursday following two days of 10-cent advances.
   But profit-taking limited the gains in soybean prices, analysts
said.
   ``I think this demonstrates the more serious concern about
potential damage to corn than to the other crops,'' said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The sell-off in wheat futures was prompted by U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter's statement early Thursday that
export subsidy programs may be reviewed if the drought continues,
analysts said.
   Traders sold wheat futures heavily despite Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng's denial of any plans to reduce subsidized exports.
   At the close, wheat was 8{ cents to 16 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.78 a bushel; corn was 6{ cents
to 15 cents higher with July at $2.94{ a bushel; oats were 4{ cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.89 a bushel; soybeans were 6{
cents lower to 22 cents higher with July at $9.42 a bushel.

<HEAD>European Industry Criticizes EEC Merger Control Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of leading European
industrialists on Wednesday criticized rules for regulating mergers
that has been proposed by the European Economic Community
Commission.
   In a statement, the European Roundtable said parts of the
proposals were unclear or unworkable, echoing similar criticisms
leveled last month by UNICE, a federation of employer organizations.
   The EEC Commission says merger rules are necessary as the
12-nation bloc moves to create a unified market by 1992 and has
proposed that it be given the power to block mergers judged to be
anti-competitive.
   The Roundtable, which consists of about three dozen big
companies, said that ``it was concerned that the present draft of
the merger regulation doesn't sufficiently support corporate
restructuring.''
   It said the commission should only be able to block a merger if
it could show that competition would be eliminated ``in the
relevant market.''
   It also said any control by the commission should allow
companies to make rapid decisions so that possible mergers would
not fail simply due to administrative procedures.

<HEAD>NY Merc To Pursue Consolidation With Comex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Mercantile Exchange said Thursday
that its board favors consolidating some of the exchange's
operations with those of the Commodities Exchange.
   Chairman William M. Brandt said Mercantile Exchange officials
planned to discuss a ``new plan'' with Comex officials early next
week, but gave no details of what it involved. He declined further
comment.
   A spokeswoman for the Comex, Avery Hunt, said the exchange would
have no comment until after the meeting. She said top Comex
officials were in Europe.
   The two exchanges have periodically discussed the possibility of
consolidating some of their operations for the past decade, but
their talks have intensified in the past year.
   The Mercantile Exchange, established in 1882 , offers trading in
oil, palladium and platinum futures. Volume totaled 25.7 million
contracts last year. The exchange has about 750 members and employs
about 300 people.
   The Commodities Exchange began operating in 1933 and offers
trading in gold, silver and copper futures and options and in
aluminum futures. Its volume amounted to 21.5 million contracts in
1987. The exchange has 772 full members and employs about 400
people.
   A report by a private consulting firm recommended last year that
the exchanges consolidate non-operating functions, such as the
legal and the administrative staffs, while keeping trading
operations separate.
   The Comex board endorsed the consultant's recommendations late
last year, but the Mercantile Exchange took no action on it.
   In its statement Thursday, the Mercantile Exchange said its
board adopted a resolution Wednesday night saying it ``intends to
pursue the consolidation of appropriate operational and
administrative functions.''
   It said consolidation would maximize efficiency and productivity
and achieve economies of scale.
   The Mercantile Exchange's board asked committees of both
exchanges to ``develop specific plans to consolidate operations''
with the Comex.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 429 money market mutual
funds fell $2.45 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $264.80 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.73 billion drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 214 general purpose funds fell $1.63 billion to $81.31
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds dropped $371.5 million to
$113.33 billion, and assets of 118 institutional funds declined
$450.3 million to $70.16 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.50 percent from 6.42 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.39 percent from 6.33 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 5.73
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.11
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.10 the
previous week. Yields were 7.44 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
7.82 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.84 percent; and 8.25
percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.27 percent.

   Stock prices took a sharp tumble today,
mirroring a plunge in bond prices and erasing gains in the previous
two sessions that had put the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
at a post-crash high.
   The Dow had climbed 32 points in the previous two sessions, and
analysts said there was a natural tendency for some profit-taking
to set in.
   But the day's decline was exacerbated sharply by disarray in the
credit markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in
a West Germany newspaper that indicated the central Bundesbank
might be tightening monetary policy.
   ``There are some indications that Japan might be doing the same,
and that says effectively that if the Federal Reserve wants to keep
the dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room to
decline,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at Frist Albany
Corp.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue was off 1| points, or
more than $16 per $1,000 in face value in late afternoon.
   Further pressuring the markets was a government report that
showed operating rates at American factories, mines and utilities
rose to 82.9 percent in May, the highest level in more than eight
years.
   The report, well above market expectations, was interpreted as a
sign that inflation may be lurking on the horizon.
   Analysts fear a crack in investors' confidence, which has been
building gradually. But lower stock prices also could bring out
some bargain hunters.

   The assault of the monster tomatoes is being
beaten back by the drought, causing competitive vegetable growers
to worry about prospective entries at the Michigan State Fair.
   Pasquale Sciortino, a St. Clair Shores, Mich., resident who last
year had the largest tomato at the state fair at 2 pounds, 7
ounces, is worried about retaining his crown.
   ``I try to put the water hose in there, but it doesn't do no
good,'' he said.
   The drought also is affecting other king-size growers.
   ``We're watering with a hose, but it's just not like Mother
Nature's rain,'' Roy Schwark of Macomb Township, Mich., said.
   Last year, the Schwarks had the largest watermelon at 43 pounds
and the tallest cornstalk at 14 feet. This year, the corn is only 4
inches tall and the watermelon plants aren't sending out vines.

<HEAD>GE To Buy Borg-Warner Chemical Business For $2.31 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. will buy Borg-Warner
Corp.'s chemical business for $2.31 billion in cash in a deal
announced Thursday that will help Borg-Warner pay off the huge
debts acquired in going private last year.
   The deal will also swell the size of GE's rapidly growing
plastics business, which will do sales of nearly $3 billion this
year.
   ``This is a big-time deal,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann, an
analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``It's a
risk-free area (for GE) and it's not controversial.''
   Chicago-based Borg-Warner will use the proceeds to reduce the
debt it took on last year in a $4.7 billion leveraged buyout to
avoid a takeover by GAF Corp.
   Borg-Warner took on bank debt of $3.4 billion in going private
and has been reducing it through proceeds from asset sales.
   Borg-Warner said it will have no trouble meeting the agreement
with banks to repay their loans by the end of 1988. ``It's a slam
dunk,'' Donald Trauscht, the chief financial officer, said in an
interview Thursday.
   The Borg-Warner chemical business, headquartered in Parkersburg,
W.Va., had sales of $1.25 billion in 1987. It is the worldwide
leader in resins for a kind of plastic, ABS, that is widely used as
a substitute for metal or glass.
   ``This acquisition is an important step in our worldwide
materials strategy,'' Glen Hiner, senior vice president for GE
Plastics, said in a news release.
   Heymann said GE's plastics business has accounted for about 5
percent of sales and 12 percent of earnings. He predicted that in
1989, the expanded business would account for 10 to 12 percent of
sales and 18 to 20 percent of earnings.
   GE said it expects the purchase to add about 5 cents a share to
its profits in 1989 after all acquisition costs are paid.
   Borg-Warner's other businesses are automotive components, and
information and protective services. The company's protective
services includes armored cars, guards and alarm stations under the
names of Wells Fargo, Burns Security and Pony Express. Auto
components include transmissions, transmission components and
four-wheel drive components.
   Borg-Warner's leveraged buyout, led by Merrill Lynch Capital
Partners, included the payment to shareholders of more than $4.1
billion in cash and slightly less than $300 million in junk bonds,
as well as the assumption of a little under $300 million in debt.
   Merrill Lynch owns 51 percent of Borg-Warner's stock.
   Among other asset sales, the company sold BWAC Inc., a finance
unit, for $782.5 million to Transamerica Inc., and Chilton Corp.,
its credit-reporting subsidiary, to TRW Inc. for $360 million.
   GE said it will also assume $35 million in Borg-Warner's
long-term debt.
   GE has been rapidly expanding its GE Plastics unit, which
expects sales of nearly $3 billion this year. It invested $325
million for a new polycarbonate plant in Burkville, Ala., last
year, and will double the size of the plant by 1990 at a cost of
$315 million.
   In May, GE Silicones announced an agreement to combine with
Union Carbide Corp.'s silicones business to form GE Carbide
Silicones Inc., a joint venture with annual sales of about $750
million.
   Borg-Warner's chemical specialty, ASB, which stands for
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, is a thermoplastic with strength
and molding characteristics that make it popular for such uses as
computer housings, helmets and car parts.
   ``We think this is a good fit with GE,'' Heymann said. ``It
moves (GE) into new niches within the same product markets and it
does give GE new geographical markets.''
   He said GE has not been a big factor in the Far East, an area
where he said Borg-Warner is ``a dominant player.''
   The transaction is subject to government approvals and is
expected to be completed by the end of 1988, the companies said.

<HEAD>Texaco, Saudis Announce Large U.S. Refining-Marketing Venture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. and Saudi Arabia announced Thursday
they will jointly refine and market petroleum in the United States
under a pact that the troubled U.S. oil giant said would give it $2
billion in cash and cost savings.
   It was the biggest joint venture ever announced between a
foreign supplier and a domestic oil company in the ``downstream''
end of the business, the process for changing crude into gasoline
and other products.
   Such a venture would help provide an assured market for Saudi
Arabia, the world's biggest exporter of oil. But some analysts said
it raised serious questions about the consequences of increased
foreign leverage over the U.S. oil industry, which has become more
reliant on imports in the past few years.
   ``We've been predicting for months that this joint venturing of
refining and marketing assets would accelerate,'' said George J.
Gaspar, oil analyst at the Milwaukee investment firm Robert W.
Baird & Co. ``It could potentially put the smaller refining and
marketing operators at a disadvantage.''
   The announcement also came as Texaco management took a battle
against takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn to its annual shareholder
meeting Friday, which could determine the destiny of the nation's
third-largest oil company.
   The timing of the announcement reflected the intense pressure
management faced to foil Icahn by convincing shareholders it was
taking aggressive steps to restructure Texaco and raise the value
of their investment.
   ``Texaco is locked in the struggle with Icahn, and it is coming
down to the wire,'' said Stephen Smith, an analyst at Bear Stearns
Cos. in New York. ``Clearly Texaco managers need to tell their
story: We are a new company, we've put the past behind us. We're
aggressively going to downsize.''
   Texaco management has said it plans to sell about $5 billion in
property to offset the disastrous effects of prolonged litigation
with Pennzoil Co., which resulted in bankpruptcy protection and a
$3 billion payment to that company. Icahn, Texaco's largest
shareholder, has denounced management performance and has offered
to buy Texaco for $60 a share. But doubts about who will prevail
helped depress the stock by 62{ cents a share Thursday to $49.25.
   Under a letter of intent between Texaco and Saudi Arabia, Saudi
Refining Inc. will have a half interest in Texaco's refining assets
and marketing system in 23 eastern and Gulf Coast states as well as
Washington, a company statement said.
   The joint venture's assets will include three major Texaco
refineries, in Delaware City, Del.; Convent, La.; and Port Arthur,
Texas; 49 terminals, about 1,450 owned and leased service stations
and a distributor network of more than 10,000 stations.
   The statement said Saudi interest in these assets was valued at
$800 million and the Saudi side would provide 30 million barrels of
the venture's initial inventory of 40 million barrels.
   It said Texaco expected to ``achieve approximately $2 billion in
cash benefits and savings from the formation of the joint venture
based on current oil prices.''
   The statement did not explain how the $2 billion figure was
derived, nor did it say whether either side could withdraw if there
were a major change in Texaco such as an Icahn-led takeover. Texaco
officials at the company's White Plains, N.Y, headquarters declined
to offer further explanation.
   Other U.S. oil companies have engaged foreign partners for
refining and marketing petroleum in this country. Venezuela's
state-owned oil company, for example, has an interest in Citgo
Petroleum Corp., which operates one of the largest U.S. refineries.
But the Texaco-Saudi deal would be the largest.
   Some analysts said such significant foreign influence in the
domestic oil industry was bound to upset Congressional lawmakers
and federal energy officials who already are concerned about
America's appetite for foreign oil.
   ``I think there are a couple of people in Washington who aren't
in favor of it,'' said Carol Epstein, managing editor at Petroleum
Analysis Ltd., a New York consulting and publishing concern.
``People still remember the long gasoline lines of the 1970s, and
it's not their most pleasant recollection.''

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended June 6, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,018 billion from $3,011 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,795 billion from $3,785 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $2.4 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $773.5 billion in the week ended June 6
from a revised $771.1 billion the previous week.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $133 million in
the week ended June 8, compared with a gain of $142 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings from the
Federal Reserve System averaged $562 million in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $395 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $207 million
in the two weeks ended Wednesday, down from an adjusted $570
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $277.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $276.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   Two former top executives of Beech-Nut
Nutritional Corp. were sentenced Thursday to a year and a day in
prison for distributing phony apple juice intended for babies.
   The case, one of the largest consumer fraud prosecutions of its
kind, involved the intentional shipment of adulterated and
misbranded juice to 20 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and
five foreign countries between 1978 and 1982.
   ``The fraud was too extensive and too involved to go
unpunished,'' said U.S. District Judge Thomas Platt of Brooklyn,
N.Y., who also levied $100,000 fines against the defendants, Neils
Hoyvald, 54, the former president and chief executive officer of
the company, and John Lavery, 56, a former vice president.
   Platt ordered both to pay court costs, which authorities
estimated would run into the tens of thousands of dollars, as well
as a special assessment of $50 for each of the hundreds of counts
on which they were convicted.
   Beech-Nut, a subsidary of Nestle S.A. of Switzerland, is the
nation's second-largest baby food maker after Gerber Products Co.
Beech-Nut is based in Fort Washington, Pa.
   Prior to sentencing, Hoyvald begged the judge to spare him a
prison term. His voice was thick with emotion and at one point he
wiped a tear from his eye.
   ``It would be so much easier to endure the torment if I had been
alone without a family. ... I cannot bear to look at them. I see in
their eyes disappointment, hurt, disgust and fear for the future
because of my condition,'' Hoyvald said. ``I ask for them and
myself, please don't send me to jail.''
   Hoyvald and Lavery, who are free on bail pending appeal, have
been on full paid leave from Beech-Nut, according to a company
spokesman. Court documents show that Hoyvald received an annual
salary of $165,000 and Lavery was paid $82,000.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Roche, in his presentencing
statement, asked that the defendants receive substantial prison
terms because they had ``perpetrated a massive fraud on American
and foreign consumers.''
   Customers were ``deprived of the choice of what to feed their
babies,'' Roche said. ``They betrayed the sacred trust accepted by
anyone who undertakes to provide nutrition to infants.''
   Platt said the details of the case pertaining to economic fraud
were ``pretty extraordinary.''
   ``I have no alternative than to do what I am going to do,'' he
said before imposing the sentences.
   The two executives, along with Beech-Nut and two suppliers, were
charged in the phony juice scheme.
   The juice, labeled 100 percent apple juice for babies, was
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no
apple juice, prosecutors charged. No evidence was presented that
the phony juice caused any health problems.
   Beech-Nut, as a corporation, pleaded guilty in November to 215
counts of violating federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a
$2 million fine.
   After a three-month trial that ended in February, a jury
convicted Hoyvald, of Lebanon, N.J., of 358 counts of violating the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Each count carried a maximum sentence
of three years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Lavery, of Schenectady, N.Y., who oversaw the upstate New York
manufacturing plant where the juice was made, was convicted of
conspiracy, 18 counts of mail fraud and 429 counts of violating
federal food and drug laws.
   Conspiracy and mail fraud carry maximum sentences of five years
in prison.
   At the trial, the government introduced evidence to show that
Beech-Nut bought adulterated and misbranded apple juice concentrate
from two suppliers, who also pleaded guilty, and used this
concentrate in apple juice and mixed apple products.
   Prosecutors said that Lavery knew of the purchase of the bogus
concentrate as early as 1978 and that Hoyvald, who became president
in April 1981, knew of its use the previous January while he was
still senior vice president in charge of marketing.
   Both defense attorneys, Brendan Sullivan Jr. for Hoyvald and
Steve Kimelman for Lavery, had urged Platt to sentence their
clients to probation and community service or home detention.
   Sullivan said Hoyvald had been punished by the loss of his
position and loss of presitige brought about by extensive media
coverage of the case.
   ``Alternative sentencing can achieve the desire of the system to
punish,'' Kimelman said. Lavery declined to comment before
sentencing.
   Andrew Maloney, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
New York, said he was satisfied that the sentences were a
``sufficient deterrent'' to other executives.
   He said economic fraud cases would continue to be a high
priority, adding that ``a great effort went into fighting this
major corporation with all its megabucks.''
   Dr. Richard C. Theurer, the current Beech-Nut president, said in
a written statement said the company had invested $10 million in
the last five years to ensure the quality of their products.
   ``Our products on the supermarket shelves today are pure,''
Theurer said. ``We know this because we test them every day.''
   In May 1987, Beech-Nut settled a class-action suit involving the
phony juice that was filed in federal court in Philadelphia.
   The company agreed to set up a $5 million cash fund for
consumers and to provide $2.5 million in Beech-Nut and affiliated
products to retailers.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Post Limit Gains For Third Straight Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices soared the permissable daily limit Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade for the third consecutive session as
fears of drought damage to the corn crop swelled.
   Soybean and oat futures also advanced on drought-related buying
while wheat futures tumbled in response to a threat of reduced
export sales.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were sharply
higher; energy futures advanced; precious metals were lower; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   The three corn contracts for 1988 delivery advanced the
15-cents-a-bushel daily limit as dry conditions prevailed in the
parched Corn Belt. The near-month contract, for delivery in July,
approached $3 a bushel for the first time since September 1984.
   But profit-taking limited the gains in soybean prices, and wheat
futures fell sharply.
   ``I think this demonstrates the more serious concen about
potential damage to corn than to the other crops,'' said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``There was a lot of profit-taking'' in the soybean and wheat
pits, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. ``People are very nervous.''
   Experts say much of the U.S. corn crop is in a critical growth
stage and requires moisture within a week to avoid severe yield
losses. The hardier and more recently planted soybeans can hold on
a bit longer.
   Corn and soybean futures also were supported by ideas that the
low water level in the Mississippi River, the traditional
grain-shipping route, could result in increased shipping of grains
out of Chicago. Such a switch could reduce supplies of grains
available for delivery against futures contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, Lespinasse said.
   The sell-off in wheat futures was prompted by U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter's statement early Thursday that
export subsidy programs may be reviewed if the drought continues,
analysts said.
   Traders sold wheat futures heavily despite Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng's denial of any plans to reduce subsidized exports.
   Wheat settled 8{ cents to 15 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.79 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 15 cents
higher with July at $2.94{ a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 10 cents
higher with July at $2.89\ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to
21{ cents higher with July at $9.41{ a bushel.
   Some livestock and meat futures rose the daily limit on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a sharp reversal of a week-long
downtrend.
   In previous sessions, cattle and pork futures prices had fallen
on ideas that high feed prices and dried-up pasture land would
force livestock producers to reduce their herd sizes, putting more
meat onto the market.
   Producers have now begun liquidating their herds, giving the
futures markets a chance to rebound slightly, said Paul Hare, an
analyst with Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   The cattle market faces a USDA cattle-on-feed report Friday that
is expected to show high numbers of cattle being fattened for
slaughter.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent lower to 1.50 cents higher with
June at 70.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to 1.40
cents higher with August at 72 cents a pound; hogs were .65 cent to
1.50 cents higher with June at 50.50 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 45.10 cents a
pound.
   Oil prices jumped sharply higher in late trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in response to market rumors that Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had died, observers said.
   The rumors could not be confirmed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent to .25 cent
higher with July at $16.66 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent to
.70 cent higher with July at 44.12 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .35 cent to .96 cent higher with July at 50.19 cents a
gallon.
   Gold and silver futures slipped a bit on the Commodity Exchange
in New York.
   Gold settled $1.20 to $1.90 lower with August at $450.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.5 cents to 1.5 cents lower with July at $7.14 a
troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 4.60 points lower at 270.20.

   The stock market tumbled Thursday, mirroring a
plunge in bond prices and eradicating gains in the previous two
sessions that had put the Dow Jones average at a post-crash high.
   The key index of 30 industrial stocks, which climbed 32 points
in the prior two trading days, plummeted 37.16 points to close at
2,094.24.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5-to-2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 435 issues up, 1,089
down and 425 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 161.55 million shares,
up from 150.26 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
186.038 million shares.
   Analysts had said there was a natural tendency for some
profit-taking to set in following the Dow average's impressive
advance of late.
   But the day's decline was exacerbated by disarray in the credit
markets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in a West
Germany newspaper that indicated the central Bundesbank might be
tightening monetary policy.
   ``There are some indications that Japan might be doing the same,
and that says effectively that if the Federal Reserve wants to keep
the dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room to
decline,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany
Corp.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue finished off 1| points,
or down more than $16 per $1,000 in face value.
   ``There was profit-taking as expected, but investors were given
a shove by the suggestion that monetary policy might be tightening
in Germany and Japan,'' Johnson said.
   Further pressuring the markets was a government report that
showed operating rates at American factories, mines and utilities
rose to 82.9 percent in May, the highest level in more than eight
years.
   The report, well above market expectations, was interpreted as a
sign that inflation may be lurking.
   Analysts fear a crack in investors' confidence, which has been
building gradually, and described the drop as jolting. ``It just
points out what thin ice we're on,'' Johnson said.
   The Dow fell through the psychologically important 2,100-point
level, a mark analysts had hoped would serve as a floor for a
further advance.
   But lower stock prices also could bring out some bargain hunters.
   ``We would use any weakness as a buying opportunity,'' one
trader said.
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down ] at 49{. The oil
company, which will face Carl Icahn it its annual shareholders
meeting Friday, announced a joint venture with a Saudi Arabian oil
company.
   General Electric was off \ at 43\. The company said it will
acquire Borg-Warner's chemical division for $2.31 billion in cash.
   Intermedics jumped 7 to 42\. The company agreed to be acquired
by Swiss-based Sulzer Brothers for $43 a share, or about $800
million.
   Elsewhere, IBM fell 1| to 117[, Deere fell 2 at 46}, Philip
Morris fell 1[ to 83, and Smithkline Beckman was off 9\ at 45}. The
pharmaceutical company predicted 1988 operating earnings will be
below last year's levels.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market decreased in value by $35.833
billion, or 1.31 percent, from Wednesday.
   The NYSE index fell 2.23 to 152.44.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 5.40 to 311.96,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 4.68 to 269.77.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.71
to 307.07. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 387.10, off 1.98.

<HEAD>Kodak Seeks Conflict Ruling Against Judge In $5.7 Billion Patent
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. is seeking to nullify all
federal court rulings since 1981 in Polaroid Corp.'s $5.7 billion
patent infringement suit, claiming the presiding judge has a
conflict of interest because her husband's late mother owned about
$100,000 worth of Kodak stock.
   In a motion filed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, Kodak
called for the immediate disqualification of Judge Rya Zobel and
dismissal of all of Zobel's rulings in the case since October 1981,
including her 1985 decision that Kodak violated several Polaroid
patents on instant camera and film.
   Kodak also recommended an award of less than $200 million
``would be more than ample to compensate Polaroid'' for any lost
profits due to Kodak's line of instant cameras and film, which
ceased production under a court order on Jan. 9, 1986.
   Cambridge, Mass.-based Polaroid, however, has deemed the Kodak
motion meritless and noted that Zobel ruled on Oct. 5, 1981 that
her mother-in-law's ownership of the stock would not present a
conflict.
   ``None of this is new to either side,'' said Polaroid spokesman
Samuel Yanes, who noted that Polaroid will likely file a counter
motion.
   Zobel's husband, state Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel, was
named executor of the estate of his mother, Harriet Zobel, who died
earlier this year and owned 2,250 Kodak shares. The Zobels are both
named as beneficiaries of Harriet Zobel's estate.
   ``Judge Zobel and her husband have, through the estate, a
financial interest in a party that could be substantially affected
by the outcome of the litigation,'' said Kodak attorneys in the
28-page motion.
   The motion noted that Harriet Zobel's stock was worth as much as
$150,000 in the past year. Kodak also claims Zobel was in a
position to ``substantially affect'' the value of Polaroid or Kodak
shares by her decisions.
   Zobel will likely rule on the motion on July 6, the next
scheduled pre-trial conference in the case, said Nina Saab, a clerk
for the judge. The trial for the damage award portion of the suit
is scheduled to begin Jan. 9.
   In February, Polaroid filed a $5.7 billion damage claim in the
case, first filed in April 1976 after Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak
began production of the line. Kodak has called the claim
``ludicrous and ridiculously inflated.''
   Kodak reported $525 million in sales of instant cameras and film
in 1981, according to the motion.
   After a five-month trial in 1985, Zobel ruled that Kodak
infringed on Polaroid's patents and ordered Kodak to stop producing
the instant cameras and film.
   In the motion, Kodak said Zobel's decision forced Kodak to fire
or reassign about 800 workers and write off $494 million in losses.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in October 1986 refused to hear Kodak's
appeal of Zobel's decision.
   Kodak also argued in the motion that a sale of the shares would
not be sufficient to eliminate the conflict.
   ``In the circumstances of this case, and given its high profile
and potential significance to shareholders and employees of Kodak
and Polaroid alike, there would inevitably be people who would
question the impartiality of a judge who went to such lengths to
remain on a case,'' said the motion.

<HEAD>Federal Criminal Probe of Alleged Payoffs by Northrop to Koreans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating
Northrop Corp.'s payment of more than $7 million to Korean
businesses in connection with its attempts to sell its F-20 jet
fighter to the Korean military, an official familiar with the case
said Thursday.
   The criminal probe, which seeks to determine if the payments in
1984 through 1986 violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, is in
its preliminary stages, said the official, who refused to be
identified. The act bars U.S. companies from making direct or
indirect payments to foreign government officials.
   The investigation, first reported in Thursday's Wall Street
Journal, apparently parallels a congressional committee inquiry
into Northrop's payments to Korean companies that were made in
connection with negotiations for sale of the fighter planes.
   Northrop isn't aware of the Justice Department probe, spokesman
Tony Cantafio said Thursday at the company's Los Angeles
headquarters.
   The company previously has portrayed itself as a victim of fraud
by the Korean companies it dealt with, and has sued in Korean
courts for return of its money.
   Korea decided against buying the F-20, which Northrop never put
into production because of a lack of orders worldwide.
   Northrop said it invested $6.5 million in a Korean hotel venture
as part of a legal ``offset'' agreement to demonstrate that in
return for the jet contract, the company was willing to help boost
the Korean economy. The probe by a subcommittee of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee focuses on that payment, along with
Northrop's payment of $1.5 million to terminate a lobbying
agreement with a company controlled by the late Park Chong-kyu, a
businessman well connected with the Korean government.
   The Justice Department will investigate a secret agreement for
Northrop to pay as much as $55 million to Park's company if the
lobbyist persuaded the Korean government to buy 200 of the fighter
planes, sources told the Journal.

<HEAD>Major Japanese Retailer Suspends Sales Of South African Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ito-Yokado Co., a major Japanese supermarket chain,
has suspended sales of South African products because of the
country's apartheid policy, a company official said Thursday.
   ``The decision not to deal in South African products was made in
view of the growing criticism in and outside the company'' against
the nation's discriminatory policy of racial segregation, said
Yasuo Takaha, spokesman for the company.
   As a result of the decision, sales of canned yellow peaches,
canned fruit cocktail and a mixed fruit juice, all imported through
a Japanese trading company, were suspended at the company's 133
stores across Japan in April.
   Takaha said the decision was made during a company meeting in
March, but the supermarket chain deliberately did not make a formal
announcement. He said the products have been replaced with similar
items from the United States.
   Takaha also declined to provide sales figures for the two South
African products. Ito-Yokado has sold the canned peaches since 1983
and the fruit cocktail since 1985.
   The move by the retailer comes at a time when Japan is facing
rising international criticism over its trade with South Africa.
Last year, Japan became South Africa's largest trading partner,
surpassing West Germany and the United States.
   In dollar terms, Japan's two-way trade with South Africa rose 19
percent to $4.27 billion last year, according to preliminary
Japanese figures.
   Japan currently prohibits all direct investment by local
companies in South Africa, bans imports of South African iron and
steel, and limits cultural, sports and tourism exchanges. It also
bans sales of computers that might be used to enforce the apartheid
system.

<HEAD>Former InterFirst Director To Plead Guilty To Bank Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former bank director Edwin L. Cox Jr. said
Thursday he had agreed to plead guilty to a federal bank fraud
charge stemming from $80 million in loans he had received from his
bank several years ago.
   Cox issued a statement saying he had agreed to plead guilty to a
charge that he submitted false information to InterFirst Bank of
Dallas as part of the administration of loans he had with the bank.
   Cited in the charges were the $80 million in loans, plus
interest, that Cox repaid to InterFirst in October 1987.
   U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins said a felony information filed
Thursday in Dallas charged Cox with bank fraud.
   Bruce Genderson, an attorney for Cox, said Cox would enter the
plea June 24. A sentencing date will be set then.
   ``In breaking the law, I have made a serious mistake,'' Cox said
in his statement. ``I have hurt my wife and children, our many
loyal friends, and employees....I am truly sorry that I have let
all these people down.''
   Collins said collateral reports filed for continuation of the
loans indicated more than 20,000 head of cattle as collateral when
there actually were fewer than 5,000.
   Maximum punishment upon conviction is five years in prison and
$250,000 in fines, Collins said.
   Cox's financial problems became public in July 1986 when the
former InterFirst Corp., the parent of InterFirst Bank Dallas that
later merged with Republic Bank to become First RepublicBank,
announced that Cox's loans were in default.
   Cox resigned as a director of the bank in June 1986. His father,
a founding director of InterFirst and for whom the Edwin L. Cox
School of Business at Southern Methodist University is named,
resigned from the bank holding company's board in August 1986.
   InterFirst at the same time announced a $281 million loss for
the quarter and said it was preparing to make a provision for loan
losses for that quarter of as much as $365 million.
   Bank officials at that time said a big part of the expected
charge was from $80 million in loans, letters of credit and other
credit InterFirst Bank extended to Cox.
   Between June 1986 and October 1987, Cox paid $96 million in
principal, interest and fees to the bank representing the full
amount owed.
   Cox also is a cattle feeder in the Texas Panhandle and a rancher
in Henderson County.
   In addition to announcing his planned guilty plea, Cox also said
he was resigning as chairman of the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Commission, which he has chaired for five years.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within a week of his departure from the
Pentagon, Melvyn Paisley went to work for United Technologies Corp.
as a consultant to help the firm get defense contracts, sources
said Thursday.
   On Tuesday, FBI agents seized records pertaining to Paisley when
they searched United Technologies' Washington offices as part of a
massive fraud and bribery probe involving alleged corruption at the
Pentagon, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The investigation involves court-authorized phone taps and bugs
at Paisley's consulting office after he left the Pentagon, said
other sources.
   The FBI agents also took from United Technologies' Washington
office documents relating to the 404 and T-406 engines which Pratt
& Whitney, a United Technologies' unit, builds for the Navy.
   Paisley began working as a United Technologies consultant within
a week after he left his Pentagon job last year, according to the
sources. Paisley was the assistant secretary of the Navy for
research, and engineering and systems. He had been recruited for
the position in 1981 by John Lehman, the secretary of the Navy and
Paisley's boss.
   Former Navy Secretary James H. Webb Jr. told The Washington Post
that he was briefed about the fraud and bribery probe last fall and
as a result of his briefings, ``It was clear that Paisley was one
of the central figures'' in the investigation.
   In addition, Webb said that 10 days before Paisley left the
Pentagon in March 1987, he had persuaded Navy officials to give him
a contract as a consultant to the office he was leaving and he won
approval to maintain his security clearance for access to
information involving the military's most secret ``black programs.''
   Webb told the Post for a story in Friday's editions that he
canceled Paisley's contract within days after taking office in
April 1987 because ``it appeared to be a conflict of interest,''
and that Paisley received no fees for it.
   Paisley, 63, a native of Portland, Ore., went to the Pentagon
from the Boeing Co., where he was manager for international
operations in the company's space and information division.
   Paisley is still a consultant for United Technologies and the
sources said his work involves lobbying efforts on behalf of
engines built by the company's Pratt & Whitney engine division.
   The 404 is being built for the Navy's F@A-18 jet airplane, and
the T-406 engine, a smaller engine which is being built for the
V-22 Osprey, a vertical take-off jet that is being developed for
both the Marines and the Air Force.
   The Pentagon has awarded $316 million worth of 404 engine
contracts to Pratt & Whitney in the past two years.
   General Electric originally had the chief contract to provide

   Larry Bingman, a spokesman for United Technologies, refused to
confirm or deny Paisley's status as a consultant. ``We, as a matter

   While he was in the Pentagon, Paisley was a key figure in the
Reagan administration's naval build-up, which in turn was a
centerpiece of the large increases in defense spending that Reagan
won during his first term after his 1980 campaign pledge to
``re-arm America.''
   Paisley and Lehman worked with Everett Pyatt, assistant Navy
secretary for shipbuilding.
   ``Everything on the Navy's procurement side went through those
