   Sen. David Karnes, appointed to office 14
months ago, won the Republican nomination for a full term Tuesday,
beating back a fierce primary challenge from Rep. Hal Daub.
   Karnes, at 39 the nation's youngest senator, will face another
tough fight in November against popular former Gov. Bob Kerrey, who
easily won the Democratic Senate nomination.
   Daub, 47, had represented the Omaha area in Congress for eight
years, but gave up his seat to challenge Karnes.
   With 68 percent of the vote counted, Karnes had 60,828 votes or
54.2 percent and Daub had 51,400 votes or 45.8 percent.

   Nebraska Sen. David Karnes won a bitter Republican primary
battle Tuesday against Rep. Hal Daub, while West Virginia Gov. Arch
Moore held a small but steady lead over a millionaire businessman
as he sought the GOP nomination for a record fourth term.
   In Nebraska's Democratic primary for Senate, popular ex-Gov. Bob
Kerrey crushed a little-known opponent, while Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd easily captured West Virginia's Democratic
Senate nomination for a sixth term.
   With 67 percent of the Nebraska vote reporting, Karnes, who was
appointed to office 14 months ago, had 57,500 votes or 53.2
percent, and Daub, who served four terms in Congress, had 50,643
votes or 46.8 percent.
   On the Democratic side, Kerrey had 50,200 votes or 91.3 percent
and Ken Michaelis, a disbarred lawyer, had 4,806 votes or 8.7
percent.
   In West Virginia, with 36 percent of the vote in, Moore, seeking
a record fourth term, had 22,919 votes or 52.3 percent and John
Raese, who accused the incumbent of failing to deal with West
Virginia's financial problems, had 20,877 votes or 47.7 percent.
   In the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination,
insurance executive Gaston Caperton was far ahead of former House
of Delegates Speaker Clyde See and five other candidates. Caperton
had 13,984 votes or 39.4 percent and See had 10,092 votes or 28.4
percent.
   The 71-year-old Byrd was piling up 27,801 votes or 81.9 percent,
while moving company owner Bob Myers had 6,158 votes or 18.1
percent.
   The GOP primary was won by state Sen. Jay Wolfe, who had 7,197
votes or 68.2 percent. Welfare recipient Bernie Lumbert had 3,351
votes or 31.8 percent.
   Nebraska's GOP Senate race proved a divisive campaign with Daub
on the attack as Karnes, the nation's youngest senator at 39, made
his first bid for elective office.

   Activists in the western Massachusetts
towns where the nuclear freeze movement was born are attacking
``Star Wars'' with the tactic they used so well eight years ago:
town meetings.
   So far, residents of 13 communities have voted to order their
town clerks to notify President Reagan of their displeasure with
the satellite-based missile-killing system also known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The anti-SDI article failed in two other towns and was tabled in
a third, but activists said Monday they were heartened by the
results thus far. Fifteen to 20 towns are expected to debate the
question in May and June.
   ``Albert Einstein said nuclear technology should be discussed on
the village square,'' said Frances Crowe of the American Friends
Service Committee of Northampton, who is helping to organize the
drive against SDI.
   ``These town meetings are really the most democratic way of
letting the people discuss and decide about nuclear issues,'' said
Crowe.
   She and others in the Coalition to Stop Star Wars, a group of 35
area activists, hope to use the town meeting votes to get an
anti-SDI question on the statewide referendum in November.
   In western Massachachusetts, where Democrats outnumber
Republicans by better than 3-1, towns have never been shy about
their opinions on global matters.
   The nuclear freeze movement began on the floors of town meetings
in western Massachusetts in the spring of 1980. It spread to the
ballot box that fall, when voters in the four westernmost counties
instructed their state senators to favor a resolution asking the
president to propose a mutual nuclear weapons moratorium to the
Soviet Union.
   In 1983, the House of Representatives passed a freeze resolution
by a 2-1 margin.
   Anti-war activists have since turned to the town meetings, a
350-year-old institution, to tell the president their thoughts on
such matters as nuclear test ban treaties.
   Anti-war sentiment runs deep in towns such as Amherst, where
residents have voted in town meetings against hostilities involving
U.S. forces since the War of 1812.
   To get a question on a town meeting warrant, a resident need
only collect 10 signatures on a petition. The Coalition to Stop
Star Wars went town to town to find sponsors for anti-SDI articles,
and held seminars explaining SDI's cost to each community.
   The 1,502 residents of Ashfield, for example, unwittingly
contributed an estimated $24,990 to ``Star Wars'' in fiscal 1988,
said Michael Holroyde of the Traprock Peace Center in Deerfield, a
non-profit, privately funded group. Since the SDI research project
began in 1983, he said, Ashfield has contributed $91,000.
   Voters at Ashfield's town meeting approved the anti-SDI article
in a voice vote.
   ``For people who have to fight hard to pay for schools and
police and fire departments, it puts the whole thing into
perspective,'' said Dr. Ira Helfand of Northampton, a member of the
national board of directors of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
   However, some of that money comes back. The University of
Massachusetts, whose main campus is in Amherst, was the
20th-largest SDI contractor in the nation, according to ``Star
Wars: The Economic Fallout,'' by the New York-based Council on
Economic Priorities.
   The book said that that in fiscal 1985 and 1986, the university
received $1.24 million in SDI contracts.
   The SDI issue has sparked much heated discussions in town
meetings, but rarely have voters questioned why the matter is
before them, Holroyde said. ``What we are talking here about is
programs we are paying for,'' he said.
   Only Whately voters rejected the resolution as an inappropriate
topic for their town meeting in a 35-28 vote, Holroyde said.
   At the Whatley meeting, resident Kenneth A. Daniels questioned
the arguments of SDI critics. ``You're criticizing the
government,'' he told them. ``To me it sounds like propaganda.''
   Besides Ashfield, the articles were approved by voice vote in
the Franklin County towns of Conway and Shelburne and were denied
by voice vote in Northfield. Franklin County voters approved the
articles by ballot, hand vote and lineups in Colrain, 56-50; Heath,
42-13; Leverett 59-4; Shutesbury, 42-4; and Wendell 96-35.
   In Hampshire County, the articles passed on voice votes in
Cummington, Huntington and Pelham.
   In Berkshire County, the articles passed in Monterey, 48-16, and
by voice vote in Windsor.

   Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stress
disorder were less sensitive to pain after seeing scenes from a war
movie, according to a study which gives a glimpse into the complex
biology of the disorder.
   The finding may also be a step toward new treatments, scientists
said.
   ``This may well be getting at some basic core biological aspect
of PTSD,'' said Roger Pitman of the Veterans Administration Medical
Center in Manchester, N.H.
   Pitman and colleague Scott Orr did the work with Bessel van der
Kolk and Mark Greenberg of Harvard Medical School. Pitman was
interviewed before speaking Monday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association.
   Post-traumatic stress disorder is estimated to affect hundreds
of thousands of people who have survived battle, airplane crashes,
earthquakes and other extreme stresses.
   Often appearing several months or years after the event, the
disorder causes sudden memories of the event that can be so vivid
that the person thinks he is going through it again. Powerful
nightmares, onslaughts of emotions that appear to have no cause,
and avoidance of close relationships can also appear.
   The condition is treated with psychotherapy, and some drugs
appear to help. Researchers hope that by understanding biological
underpinnings of the disorder they can find more effective
medications.
   Animals exposed to extreme stress, such as inescapable electric
shocks, typically lose sensitivity to pain, Pitman said, because
their bodies release natural painkillers called endorphins.
   When animals are given a substance called naloxone that blocks
the action of endorphins, sensitivity to pain returns to normal, he
said.
   The same phenomenon has been reported in humans exposed to
electric shocks, he said.
   The new work involved eight Vietnam veterans with the disorder
and eight combat veterans who did not develop the condition.
   Researchers applied heat to their forearms and asked them to
rank the intensity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 100. The
experiment was done at several temperatures and the ratings were
averaged.
   The veterans' pain sensitivity was measured before and after
they watched 15 minutes of an ambush scene from the Vietnam movie
``Platoon.''
   The experiment was done twice. One time the veterans received
the endorphin-blocking substance naloxone, and the other time a
placebo. Neither the veterans nor the researchers knew which was
being administered at the time.
   Six of the eight veterans with the disorder showed a decrease in
pain sensitivity after viewing the ambush scene and getting the
placebo. The decrease averaged about 30 percent.
   Naloxone prevented the decrease in sensitivity, showing it was
due to endorphins, Pitman said.
   Even with the placebo, no change in pain sensitivity appeared in
seven of the eight other veterans.
   Pitman said he doubts the endorphins themselves cause symptoms
of the disorder, but that their appearance in response to the movie
reflects a learned response caused by the severe stress of the
original combat experience.
   The finding is new evidence that the disorder ``does indeed have
a complex and unique biological basis,'' said Matthew J. Friedman,
professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at Dartmouth Medical
School and chief of the psychiatry service at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt.
   It supports the theory that the disorder is associated with
biological alterations in the brain's endorphin system, affecting
the brain's emotion and arousal centers, he said.
   In another study reported Monday, researchers found that nine
post-traumatic stress disorder patients tended to have a different
hormone profile from that of seven depression patients.
   Scientists at the Yale University School of Medicine found the
difference by studying each patient's levels of cortisol,
epinephrine, growth hormone, norepinephrin, testosterone and
thyroxin.

   A jury Monday convicted a man accused of being
Denver's Capitol Hill rapist of 14 counts in connection with
assaults on six women.
   The seven-woman, five-man jury convicted Quintin Wortham, 27, of
five counts of rape, one count of attempted rape, six burglary
counts and two counts of theft. District Judge Lynne Hufnagel set
sentencing for Friday. Wortham could be sentenced to a maximum of
350 years.
   Wortham, who acted as his own attorney throughout the trial, his
second, was charged with five rapes and one attempted rape in
Denver's Capitol Hill neighborhood in 1985 and 1986.
   His first trial ended in a mistrial because of his behavior
while acting as his own counsel.
   District Attorney Norm Early said, ``The jury saw that justice
was done. It was a very swift verdict.''
   Wortham, who took more than two hours during closing arguments
on Friday trying to convince the jury of his innocence, showed no
emotion as the verdicts were read Monday.
   Wortham had claimed the victims misidentified him.
   One woman who testified against Wortham in both trials told
reporters following the verdict it had been difficult to look him
in the face. ``I didn't do it often; but when I was called on, it
reaffirmed my conviction he was the man.''
   Hufnagel disallowed results of a new DNA test that prosecutors
say proved that Wortham raped a woman in 1985. The judge said
admission of the scientific evidence would not be fair to Wortham
and could result in a reversal of a conviction.
   Hufnagel said no appeals court had yet approved DNA testing and
only five states, not including Colorado, accept it.

   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity urged a
high-level Chinese delegation Monday to end protectionist measures
that have forced some U.S. companies ``to question the wisdom of
pursuing business in China.''
   Verity made his comments as he greeted Chinese Vice Premier Tian
Jiyun at the start of the sixth meeting of the two governments'
joint commission on commerce and trade.
   Tian said China is ``unswervingly pursuing the policy of reform
and opening to the outside world,'' as part of its program ``to
build a socialist political system with a high degree of democracy
... a system that it is effective and full of vitality.''
   During the day, Vice President George Bush hosted Tian at a
dinner at Blair House, the restored U.S. official guest quarters.
The vice premier was scheduled to meet President Reagan on Tuesday.
   Verity told the Chinese delegation that the United States is
making progress in reducing trade deficits and asserted that ``the
United States has recovered from the shock of a wave of imports
that swept the country ....''
   China, meanwhile, over the past year has overcome challenges to
its economic reforms and reaffirmed its commitment to reform,
Verity said.
   However, he noted, China at the same time has expanded import
controls and raised tariffs.
   In the past two years, he said, China has restored some
confidence in the climate for joint ventures with foreign firms,
but still, ``high cost and uncertainty of doing business ... are
forcing some (U.S.) companies to question the wisdom of pursuing
business in China.''
   Verity said China's recently announced first-stage foreign trade
reform is a major step in promoting competition, but he complained
that ``trade restrictions appear to have increased ... a
significant number of new import barriers have appeared ....''
   ``A policy which stresses exports while heavily protecting the
domestic market will also lead to increase friction in the
bilateral trade relationship'' between China and the United States,
he added.
   Tian, in a speech released by the Chinese Embassy, said U.S.
industries should recognize that there is ``fierce competition'' to
sell to China, and that he hopes they will become more competitive
by improving quality, technical features and terms of trade.
   He called for ``eventual removal of all undue restrictions'' on
selling U.S. high-technology products to China, and urged the
United States not to impose any new controls against import of
Chinese textiles, his country's major export.
   Verity said the United States would work with China to smooth
its entry into GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on
terms that would bolster Beijing's efforts to promote open market
conditions and competitiveness.
   The secretary also said the United States would continue to
expand transfer of high technology in its China trade.
   A basic objective of the three-day commission meeting was to
increase that trade, which last year reached a $10.4 billion total
in both directions. Verity indicated the session would air measures
to improve the business environment for U.S. firms trading with
China in such areas as patent and copyright protection, contract
and dispute procedures and profitability.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis showed
strength among Reagan Democrats in the Nebraska and West Virginia
presidential primaries Tuesday, a good sign for him in November
should he win the Democratic nomination.
   Nearly a quarter of the Democrats voting said they backed
President Reagan in 1984, but about three-quarters of them said
this year they would support Dukakis over George Bush, an ABC News
exit poll found.
   ``Dukakis could bring home the Reagan Democrats,'' said ABC News
poll analyst Doug Muzzio. He noted that the finding has been
consistent since ABC started asking the question in its Connecticut
exit poll March 29.
   The ABC poll Tuesday said Jackson scored one of his best
showings of the primary season with white voters in Nebraska,
winning 24 percent of the white vote. He did better only in
Vermont, where he won 32 percent in an ABC poll.
   Still, Dukakis won all white subgroups in Nebraska and won
overwhelming majorities of voters of all groups other than blacks
in West Virginia, Muzzio said. Dukakis even made some inroads into
the small black vote, winning 32 percent of the black vote in West
Virginia and 11 percent in Nebraska.
   Blacks made up 4 percent of the total in West Virginia and 5
percent in Nebraska, and the margin of sampling error is high for
such a small group in a poll. Among all voters, the error margin
was 5 points in the surveys.
   As in other recent contests, Dukakis appeared acceptable to
voters across the spectrum of political ideologies in his party,
Muzzio said. A majority of liberals, a majority of moderates and a
plurality of conservatives said his views were ``just right'' as
opposed to too liberal or too conservative.
   ``In a sense, ideologically Dukakis is a Rorschach test,''
Muzzio said. ``Voters of different ideologies look at Dukakis and
are seeing what they want to see. In a sense he's all ideologies to
all voters.''
   Still, Muzzio noted that a sizeable share of voters _ about 30
percent _ said they did not know enough about Dukakis' ideological
stand to answer the question on ideology.
   Jackson, who appealed to distressed farmers in Nebraska for
their votes, ran somewhat more competitively there than in West
Virginia. About a quarter of the voters said the poor and elderly
were a key issue to them, and Jackson won that group, 52 percent to
44 percent for Dukakis. Another quarter said an ability to bring
changes was key, and Jackson won them 50 to 42, ABC said.
   The key issue to the most voters in both states was job
protection, and Dukakis won a majority of that group.
   Most significant for the fall, Muzzio suggested, was Dukakis'
support from Reagan Democrats. In West Virginia, 23 percent of the
primary voters told ABC they backed Reagan in 1984, and 73 percent
of them said they would vote for Dukakis over Bush. In Nebraska, 22
percent of the total said they voted for Reagan in 1984, and 78
percent said they would take Dukakis over Bush.

   The leftfielder wore a
.38-caliber pistol on his hip, and the sandlot baseball game was
held on the obstacle course of an army base.
   But the Jewish settlers, most American emigrants, intently
pursued the U.S. pastime on a sunny afternoon in May and saw little
strange in the setting. In fact, they viewed their ball game as a
symbol of the normalcy of life in the occupied West Bank.
   ``This could be anywhere in the U.S.A. on a summer afternoon,''
Mordechai Goodman, 46, said, surveying the field where about 30
Israelis aged 5 to 50 had gathered to watch and play.
   Goodman, who wore a Houston Astros T-shirt, quit a job as a
men's wear salesman in Manhattan two years ago to move to the West
Bank settlement of Efrat nearby, where he opened a pizzeria.
   ``I guess you could say this is a sign of how normal life is
here,'' he said, tossing a softball to his 4-year-old son, Shimon.
   Maybe so, but Ephraim Ben-Zeev, a physician who had jogged over
to the field from Efrat to watch his teen-age son play, carried a
.357 Magnum on one hip. He said the gun was insurance against being
ambushed by Palestinian youths.
   ``I wear it in case there is a sudden shower of stones. Thank
heavens I haven't had to use it yet,'' said Ben-Zeev, who was
listening to rock music on a radio-cassette player.
   He stood along the foul line that led past a large piece of
board used to train soldiers to scale walls. The flames of an
explosion were painted on the wood in fading red and orange.
   Settlers maintain that media concentration on five months of
Palestinian riots has given a distorted picture of the actual
situation in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. They say daily
life continues largely unaffected for the 65,000 Jewish residents
of the occupied territories.
   While there is no evidence that settlers are leaving their homes
in the occupied lands, government and settlement officials agree
that the unrest has affected potential residents.
   Yossi Margalit, a housing ministry official, said the impact has
been greater on the ``commuter settlers'' who live just outside
Israel's 1967 borders and are lured primarily by the chance to live
in a house with a yard instead of in an cramped urban apartment.
   ``There has been some decline in purchases of homes in towns''
near the Israeli border, Margalit said. ``But deeper into the
territory, where the idealists live, there hasn't been a change.''
   He estimated that housing sales have declined by a few
percentage points, but stressed there has been no mass departures
from the area. ``Some perhaps have left the (large settlements) for
personal reasons, but (the Palestinian uprising) hasn't been the
dominant factor,'' he said.
   Even before the riots began Dec. 8, the settlement building
program had slowed. Since 1984, the government has approved six
settlements but people are living in only four.
   Government spending on settlements, which totaled $2 billion
between 1968 and 1986, has declined from a 1982-83 peak of $250
million a year to $150 million at the end of 1986, according to
Meron Benvenisti's West Bank Data Project. The studies by the
independent center are funded by the U.S. Ford and Rockefeller
foundations.
   In Efrat, eight miles south of Jerusalem, town manager Yossi
Beck said the settlement's bulletin board had notices from
prospective buyers seeking houses.
   But he said many of the 300 families who have moved in the
hilltop community since 1983 have begun to wonder what will happen
as a result of the unrest.
   ``If it continues, there is no doubt it will affect the idea of
people moving here,'' said Beck, an immigrant from Holland. ``My
feeling is that after it calms down the interest in people moving
here will resume.''
   Shlomo Riskin, chief rabbi of Efrat and a driving force behind
its founding in 1983, said he was pressing ahead with plans to
expand the settlement with 450 more houses and a religious
education center.
   ``This was just stones,'' Riskin said, pointing to Grape Hill on
which is built a cluster of villas with red tile roofs. Rows of
houses under construction are going up on nearby Pomegranate Hill
and more units are planned for Date Hill, he said.
   For Riskin, the attachment to this land is rooted in modern and
ancient history and this lure is felt by residents, most of whom
are Orthodox Jews.
   ``The young shepherd boy David raised his flocks here in Efrat,
and the book of Ruth takes place here in the city of Efrat,'' said
Riskin, who emigrated from New York City.
   At the same time, he maintains there is a national consensus to
stay in Gush Etzion, the bloc of settlements that includes Efrat.
This stems from the killing of 200 Jewish settlers there in the
1948 war of independence.
   The unrest, he said, had strengthened settlers' commitment. ``If
anything, it has drawn us more closely together,'' Riskin said.

<HEAD>Dairy Group Protests Further Cuts In Milk Price Supports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dairy farmers are being asked to join a
lobbying effort by the National Milk Producers Federation to head
off a further cut in federal milk price supports scheduled by the
Agriculture Department next year.
   The 72-year-old federation, which represents most of the
nation's dairy cooperatives, wants Agriculture Secretary Richard E.
Lyng to use authority in the 1985 farm law to cancel the next
reduction in milk supports on Jan. 1, 1989, in favor of an
alternate plan to cut production.
   ``Enough is enough,'' federation president Tom Camerlo, Canon
City, Colo., said Monday. ``Dairy farmers are tired of suffering
continual price reductions after having done more to address
federal policy concerns than any segment of U.S. agriculture.''
   Camerlo said Lyng has the authority to set up a new whole-herd
buyout or a diversion program, both of which have been used in
recent years to trim U.S. milk production.
   However, Lyng has been steadfast against reviving the buyout and
diversion programs as an alternative to the reduction in price
supports.
   Camerlo and other federation officials told a news conference at
the National Press Club that the 50-cent reduction scheduled for
next Jan. 1 would put the milk support level at $10.10 per 100
pounds of milk, the lowest since 1979.
   ``Dairy farmers will have to live at 1979 income levels with
1989 costs,'' he said.
   Milk price supports have been lowered progressively from a
record high of $13.10 per 100 pounds since 1983 to help discourage
surplus production. A diversion plan to pay farmers for cutting
back production, and a whole-herd buyout, or Dairy Termination
Program, also were used.
   The 18-month whole-herd buyout program began April 1, 1986, and
continued through October 1987. More than 1.22 million dairy cows,
heifers and calves were sent to market by thousands of producers
who agreed to quit dairying for at least five years.
   About 38 percent of the buyout program's cost of $1.8 billion
was paid by dairy farmers themselves who were charged assessments
on milk they sold. Similar arrangements helped hold down costs on
the earlier diversion plan.
   Camerlo said the 50-cent reduction next Jan. 1 would come as
milk production costs, including feed, are on the upswing. The
two-way crunch would add up next year to a 37 percent slide in
dairy farm income from 1987 levels.
   Dairy farmers have contributed $2.9 billion in assessments since
1983 to reduce the costs of their programs by 50 percent, overall,
Camerlo said.
   Federation leaders have met frequently with USDA officials,
including Lyng, in an attempt to persuade them to abandon the path
of lower milk supports.
   ``The secretary has been consistent, as has his staff, that they
will cut the price,'' Camerlo said. ``They do not intend to utilize
the authority that they have in the '85 act to implement a
whole-herd or Dairy Termination Program.''
   Camerlo said Lyng stated that policy at the federation's annual
meeting in December 1986 and has not budged.
   ``Another 50-cent cut in the dairy price support level on Jan.
1, 1989, is simply unsound policy,'' he said. ``It will increase,
not reduce federal dairy program costs. And it will be as costly _
and perhaps more costly _ to the government than another limited,
dairy termination program.''
   The previous DTP in 1986-87 was designed to reduce milk
production by 12 billion pounds. Camerlo said a limited DTP could
be set up to cut production by 4 billion or 5 billion pounds, which
would serve as a stopgap measure until new legislation is worked
out.
   According to USDA figures, milk production in calendar 1987
declined about 1 percent to 142.5 billion pounds from a record of
143.8 billion pounds in 1986. But production is rising again and is
expected to gain 1 percent to 3 percent in 1988 to another record
level.

   Visitors to national forests may soon find it
easier to enjoy the scenery, says the Agriculture Department.
   Officially, stretches of road selected will be called National
Forest Scenic Byways, Forest Service chief F. Dale Robertson said
Monday.
   ``Scenic driving is the single most popular form of outdoor
recreation on the national forests,'' Robertson said. ``Many of the
105,000 miles of roads we have designed and maintained for
passenger car travel pass through some of America's most
spectacular scenery.''
   Designated byways will have interpretive signs, some overlook
and parking areas, and other facilities such as rest stops and
short-loop walking trails, he said.
   ``There are 156 national forests across the United States and we
want to showcase their beauty with these byways,'' Robertson said.
   The agency will seek partnerships with groups and organizations
to identify suitable roads and to assist in placing signs,
developing interpretive materials and constructing facilities, he
said.
   Some examples of scenic roads that Robertson said could be
included in the program:
   _Talimena Scenic Drive in the Ouachita National Forest in
Arkansas and Oklahoma, which follows the top of Winding Stair
Mountain.
   _Mount Hood Scenic Loop in the Mount Hood National Forest in
Oregon, which runs from Portland, around Mount Hood, and into the
Columbia River Gorge.
   _Carson Pass Forest Highway in the Eldorado National Forest in
California, which covers 25 miles in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
   _Kancamagus Scenic Road in the White Mountain National Forest in
New Hampshire, which covers 32 miles with overlooks that view the
Presidential Range.

   Farmers idled about 59.9 million acres of
cropland under 1987 acreage reduction programs, an area larger than
all of Minnesota and Maryland combined, according to new
Agriculture Department figures.
   The preliminary report for compliance in the 1987 programs said
Monday the acreage represented about 87 percent of the base acreage
for wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice.
   In 1986, by comparison, farmers idled 44.6 million acres, or 82
percent of their total base for those crops.
   Wheat farmers idled 23.8 million acres last year, followed by
corn, 23 million acres; sorghum, 4 million; barley, 2.9 million;
oats, 800,000; cotton, 3.8 million; and rice, 1.6 million.

<HEAD>Mondale Urges Dukakis To Use Different Strategy Than His For
Picking Veep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter F. Mondale says the interviews he held
four years ago with prospective running mates proved a ``damaged
strategy'' and he thinks Michael Dukakis ought to find a different
way of selecting the Democratic vice presidential nominee this year.
   Four years ago, Mondale interviewed a succession of candidates
before he chose Geraldine Ferraro, then a congresswoman from New
York, as the first woman on a major party's national ticket. One by
one, the vice presidential hopefuls visited Mondale at his home in
Minnesota.
   In retrospect, ``I don't think it built confidence,'' Mondale
said of the process. The 1984 Democratic presidential nominee's
comments came in a telephone interview from his Minneapolis law
office on Monday.
   ``I don't think the way that process played out reassured
Americans,'' he said. ``It's a damaged strategy even though it was
not a bad idea.''
   He suggested that Dukakis ``pursue a different way of looking at
vice presidential candidates.''
   Asked if he thought Dukakis, who now appears likely to lock up
the Democratic presidential nomination before the July convention,
should choose a Southerner for his running mate, Mondale said, ``I
wouldn't say he has to. But what I can't figure out is how you get
the numbers if you don't run strong in the South.''
   Mondale was optimistic about the Democrats' chances of winning a
presidential election for only the second time in the last six.
   ``We've got a shot at this deal,'' he said.
   Republican Vice President George Bush ``is a troubled
candidate,'' he said. ``I think he gets off in an uncertain way. I
think there are going to be vulnerabilities on both sides. But
Dukakis looks strong as a person and I don't think Bush does.''
   Mondale said there is a need to ``constantly reassure Americans
that you possess that special presidential strength of character
and independence and resolve to serve the public interest.''
   In recent campaign appearances, Bush often has seemed to be
campaigning against Jimmy Carter, under whom Mondale served as vice
president.
   ``I believe that's a sign of weakness,'' said Mondale. ``Here's
a guy who ought to be filling in the blanks where people are
worried about him, which is character and vision and direction and
presidential status.
   ``Instead, he's out there hacking around against a president
who's been out of office for eight years.''
   Mondale also suggested that Dukakis avoid following his example
of declaring that if elected president he would raise taxes to
reduce the federal deficit.
   ``I think it's too bad ...that we can't talk about our real
problems,'' he said, but ``I think the verdict is in on that.''

<TEXT>
   As Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
prepares for a likely fall campaign, Vice President George Bush
isn't the only one going after him. Dukakis has the likes of
Dorothea Thomas-Vitrac to contend with too.
   Thomas-Vitrac's dispute with the Massachusetts governor is
strictly a local affair. But she _ like other political enemies of
Dukakis _ intends to do what she can to disrupt the governor's
presidential bid in order to make her point. As Dukakis comes under
increasing scrutiny, that task becomes easier and easier.
   Thomas-Vitrac is a member of the board of selectmen in the tiny
western Massachusetts town of New Braintree, where Dukakis has
proposed building a 500-bed prison. She has led the fight against
it.
   When Dukakis went to Iowa late last year to tell struggling
farmers he was concerned about their plight, Thomas-Vitrac went too.
   ``He wouldn't acknowledge me, but I was blocking the only
entrance to the pigpen,'' Thomas-Vitrac said. ``I think I made my
point.''
   Former Massachusetts Gov. Edward King, a former Democratic
governor who has switched parties, is making his point too. The
Bush campaign is bankrolling King's travel around the country
criticizing Dukakis.
   King turned Dukakis out of office in 1978; Dukakis defeated King
in 1982.
   King made a speech Monday, attacking Dukakis' image as a
competent manager.
   ``I don't think it's based on facts,'' he said. ``I think it
sharply contrasts what he has done.''
   A Dukakis presidency, King said, would bring ``an ever
expanding, more costly government, more regulation, more taxes.''
   Another vocal Dukakis opponent is Barbara Anderson, the director
of the anti-tax group Citizens for Limited Taxation. The group has
successfully battled Dukakis' efforts in the last five years to
create additional exemptions to a voter-passed property tax cap.
   When Dukakis takes credit on the presidential campaign trail for
cutting taxes back home in Massachusetts, Anderson fumes.
   ``He was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts,''
said Anderson. ``The reputation is a fabricated myth.''
   When Dukakis heads to California later this week to campaign, he
likely will be reminded of a policy in Massachusetts that
effectively bans homosexuals from becoming foster parents by
encouraging placements of foster children in ``traditional''
families.
   The Washington-based National Gay and Lesbian Task Force since
last year has organized protests of Dukakis events, and activists
and newspapers in California's gay community have criticized the
policy.
   Dukakis is a supporter of a gay rights bill languishing before
the state legislature, but the foster parent policy has tended to
overshadow that.
   ``He's responsible for a very discriminatory social policy,''
said task force spokeswoman Sue Hyde.
   Massachusetts politics are dominated by Democrats, but not all
of them shower praise on Dukakis.
   ``I've always felt that he's spent too much,'' said Rep. John
Flood of Canton, chairman of the House Taxation Committee. ``We've
spent all this money and we haven't addressed our major problems,
overcrowded prisons, unfunded pension liability and the need for
more money to clean up hazardous waste.''
   Flood was quick to add: ``Of course George Bush has a lot of
baggage of his own.''
   Charlie Manning, meanwhile, is relishing his job these days.
   As the top spokesman for the Massachusetts Republican Party,
Manning gets a lot of attention when he talks about Dukakis.
Manning said he has been fielding an ``incredible'' number of
telephone calls from out-of-state reporters in recent weeks.
   Not only does Manning take every opportunity to rap the governor
_ he calls the thought of a Dukakis presidency ``scary'' _ he's
always willing to steer journalists toward other critics of Dukakis.
   In fact, he has a new card in his desktop Rolodex _ just for
numbers of Dukakis enemies.
   ``I made it just for moments like these,'' he said with obvious
glee.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis held one in a series of meetings
with congressional leaders and renewed his demand that George Bush
detail his knowledge of alleged drug trafficking by Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Dukakis did not campaign this week for today's primaries in
Nebraska and West Virginia. He took the weekend off and spent
Monday at the Statehouse. Dukakis paid visits to both Nebraska and
West Virginia last week, however.
   Dukakis has said he is still focusing on Jesse Jackson and the
remaining primaries, but his comments about Bush and the meeting
with New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley were signs he is looking
increasingly toward the fall campaign.
   ``I think that the American people deserve an overall
explanation about who in this administration was doing business
with him (Noriega) and why,'' Dukakis said Monday.
   ``I can tell you one thing: If I'm the president we won't be
doing business with drug-running Panamanian dictators,'' Dukakis
said as he left his Statehouse office.
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said Monday that the vice president
was aware before Noriega's indictment on drug charges in February
of speculation that the Noriega government was involved in drug
trafficking. But Teeley said the information was not substantive.
   Bradley told reporters that his meeting with Dukakis centered on
U.S.-Soviet relations. He said the topic of the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket did not come up during the meeting, adding he was
not interested and would be a poor choice anyway.
   ``That's not in the cards,'' Bradley said as he left Dukakis'
office. ``Massachusetts and New Jersey don't go well together.''
   Bradley said he did not think Dukakis' lack of foreign policy
experience would hurt him in his expected general election campaign
against Bush, although the vice president has already raised the
issue.
   ``Experience is no substitute for ability and he's got real
ability,'' Bradley said.
   Bradley said he expected Dukakis to defeat Jesse Jackson in New
Jersey's primary June 7, the same day as the California primary.
   The Massachusetts governor said he and Bradley ``had a good
discussion.''
   Dukakis plans to travel to Washington, D.C., on Thursday for
meetings with congressional leaders including House Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas and Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West
Virginia.

   Security police raided the headquarters
of an underground dissident publishing operation and seized 1,500
copies of a newsletter critical of Communist Party policies, an
activist said.
   Gabor Demszky, an underground book publisher and editor of the
newsletter known as The Message, said police on Monday seized the
publication and printing equipment in a house near Lake Balaton.
   Demszky said the publication contained articles from several
groups and was timed to coincide with the May 20 Communist Party
conference.
   ``They are trying to make an example of us,'' Demszky told The
Associated Press in a Budapest apartment, ``but they won't succeed
in stopping us.''
   A growing number of independent non-Communist and activist
groups have been calling for more openness and representation in
Hungarian society.
   Demszky said the latest issue of the newsletter contained
articles and commentaries on the policies of Communist Party leader
Janos Kadar.

   A shipment of 402 boxes of Girl Scout cookies
will finally reach sailors aboard the USS Midway after being
blocked once by Japanese officials and returned to Corpus Christi,
Texas.
   ``That's good news for our sailors and for the Brownies from
Troop 807,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said Monday while
announcing that the dispute with Japanee customs officials had been
resolved.
   Bentsen said the cookies should be on their way sometime today
now that Japanese officials have relented.
   Japanese customs officials initially blocked the shipment of
cookies from the Brownie troop in Corpus Christi and assessed a
$2,000 duty fee, which Brownie officials said was too steep for the
children.
   The cookies were shipped April 26, then spent four days in a
Japanese customs warehouse before being returned to the airport in
Corpus Christi.
   Thirty-five servicemen aboard the aircraft carrier had ordered
cookies from the Brownies, who had sent the men Christmas cards and
a Valentine's Day box of candy.
   The Midway's home port is Atsugi, Japan.

<HEAD>Bush's Defense On Two Fronts: Lack Of Knowledge</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's defense on his two biggest
campaign liabilities, the Iran-Contra affair and alleged drug
dealing by Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, is the same: a
plea of ignorance.
   On both counts, the Republican presidential candidate sounds
alike:
   _Although he once headed the Central Intelligence Agency and a
presidential task force on drugs, he says he didn't know Noriega
was involved in alleged drug trafficking until this past February,
when a U.S. indictment was handed down in Florida.
   _Even though a member of the National Security Council, he says
he had no hint that U.S. arms were being sold to Iran in an effort
to free hostages, or that proceeds were funnelled illegally to the
Contras in Nicaragua.
   The vice president's continued denial of advance knowledge in
both instances has hung over his campaign like a two-edged sword.
   Either he knew more than he's admitting, in which case he's not
telling the truth; or the candidate who claims vast experience in
foreign policy was kept in the dark on two matters of crucial
international importance.
   Either way, it's a no-win political situation for Bush.
   The vice president has stock ways of dealing with the twin
issues.
   Of Iran-Contra, he says he fully expects Democrats to exploit it
as a major campaign issue, but claims that's only because they have
little else to talk about.
   And the political fallout so far has been minimal, he claims.
   ``It's been tried. It was used against me in the (GOP)
primaries,'' he told reporters during a campaign stop last week in
Idaho. ``It doesn't show up _ unless they (Democrats) have got data
that I haven't seen _ as a great vulnerability.
   ``I certainly can't say it's a plus,'' Bush conceded. ``But,
fortunately neither of them (Democratic candidates Michael Dukakis
and Jesse Jackson) has any experience at all in international
affairs. So I can offset the criticism by talking about the rest of
the world. That's what I've tried to do.''
   On Noriega, Bush maintains he lacked clear knowledge that the
Panamanian general was involved in alleged drug dealings before the
indictment three months ago. Campaign spokesman Peter Teeley said
Monday that Bush was aware of rumors of such activity but viewed
them as unsubstantiated.
   ``We heard all sorts of accusations about the government in the
Bahamas, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico and Panama,'' Teeley said.
``But the question is, when do you get concrete evidence that
something of this nature is indeed true?''
   As recently as last Thursday in Los Angeles, Bush reiterated his
denial of any advance knowledge of Noriega's alleged drug dealings.
   Asked whether he ever had been told of reports of ties between
Noriega and drugs, Bush said, ``Not that I was ever aware of.''
   Seeking to deflect criticism, Bush says the Reagan
administration sought to bring Noriega to justice ``once we found
out he had gone bad.''
   He also has made an anti-drug theme a major thrust of his race,
calling for a Western Hempishere drug ``summit'' and for an
international anti-drug force under the auspices of the United
Nations. And he has challenged Dukakis and Jackson to show they're
as serious as he is by joining him in supporting the death penalty
for ``drug kingpins.''
   Thus far, the Democrats have not gone for the bait.
   Democratic front-runner Dukakis accuses the Reagan-Bush
administration of ``dealing with drug-running Panamanian
dictators.'' And Jackson asserts: ``The reason Mr. Bush has not led
the charge to fight drugs is because he knew of the
administration's dealings with the drug dealers.''
   The question of exactly when Bush learned of Noriega's alleged
role in drug-dealing was first raised in the Republican primaries
by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. Bush has been hit with the question by
reporters at nearly every campaign stop since.
   The accusations go to the core of Bush's campaign, since he
trumpets repeatedly his experience in international affairs _ with
a resume that includes serving as CIA director, ambassador to the
United Nations, envoy to the People's Republic of China and heading
the South Florida Task Force, a federal drug-interdiction effort in
the early 1980s.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of a Senate
subcommittee on Latin American affairs, has said he would be
surprised if Bush didn't have advance knowledge of Noriega's
alleged drug trafficking, given his extensive credentials. ``If he
didn't know, that's almost as disturbing,'' Dodd says.
   But Teeley said Monday: ``The Democrats have nothing to attack
Bush on. They can't attack him on unemployment, inflation, interest
rates; they're all down. Personal income is up. Real wages are up.
Taxes are down. There is a new arms-control treaty. So they are
going to be looking for issues like this (Noriega and Iran-Contras)
to attack him on.''

<HEAD>Chairman Challenges Meese Aide on Report Criticizing AG</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assistant Attorney General William Bradford
Reynolds has been challenged to back up his criticism of a
bipartisan report saying Attorney General Edwin Meese III violated
White House ethics policy.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., urged Reynolds in a letter Monday to
``kindly inform us'' of any incorrect information in the 244-page
report issued by his subcommittee.
   The report accuses Meese of violating White House ethics policy
by helping the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. obtain a $32 million
no-bid Army contract while he was counselor to the president.
   Reynolds on Sunday called the report ``sleaze,'' and said the
policy went into effect after ``the Wedtech thing was referred over
to the attorney general.''
   However, the Senate report noted that memos sent to Meese from
his longtime friend E. Robert Wallach seeking help for Wedtech came
to then-White House counselor Meese in 1982 as well as in 1981. The
White House policy barring contact by White House staff with
procurement officers about a contract in which a friend has a
financial interest took effect in October 1981.
   In addition to asking Reynolds to back up his criticism of the
report, Levin pointed out that it was the work of four Republicans
as well as five Democrats.
   Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said Reynolds ``will
respond in due course'' to Levin's letter.
   Meese has acknowledged intervening on behalf of Wedtech, a South
Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor, in connection with the $32 million
Army contract. Wedtech subsequently won the no-bid contract.
   Meese says he merely wanted to assure that Wedtech got a fair
hearing.

   Powerful winds ripped through the center of a Kentucky town
Monday, causing widespread damage and killing one person, while
hail storms battered homes and cars in a four-state area southeast
of Lake Michigan.
   A day earlier, as many as 82 tornadoes swept through the Midwest.
   In Middlesboro, Ky., wind gusts blew roofs of downtown
buildings, shattered windows and leveled the top floor of a
furniture building, officials said.
   ``It's not just a few shingles, it's entire roofs,'' said Lt.
Woody White of the Middlesboro Fire Department. ``The buildings we
can see (from fire department building), the roofs are gone.''
   One person was killed and there were numerous injuries, said
Sgt. Jimmy England of the Middlesboro Police Department.
   `Oh Lord. When I was on the floor, I just saw my life, I just
thought I was gone,'' said Lemodee Gilbert, 20, who is six weeks
pregnant. ``Well I've got a bunch of cuts and bruises, but you
know, thank God I'm alive. I just thank God I didn't lose it.''
   Mayor Troy Welch declared an emergency and was trying to reach
the governor's office to ask for help from the National Guard.
   Weather officials said they could not immediately determine if a
tornado had struck. The city of 11,000 is in southeast Kentucky,
bordering on Tennessee and Virginia.
   A low-pressure system over the upper Mississippi Valley and
north of the Great Lakes produced the tornadoes and threatened to
stir up more twisters or thunderstorms Monday in southeast lower
Michigan, Ohio, southeast Indiana and north-central Kentucky,
forecasters said.
   ``It was unusual to have so many reports of tornadoes in one day
as occurred yesterday,'' Lyle Alexander, a meteorologist at the
National Weather Service in Kansas City, Mo., said Monday.
   The weather service received 82 reports of tornadoes Sunday in
Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana and Arkansas, but some may be
downgraded after further investigation, he said.
   Few injuries were reported, but an Indiana man was killed Sunday
when high winds collapsed a building under construction, Lake
County Coroner Daniel Thomas said. At the outset of the violent
weather Saturday, a 29-year-old woman and her 2-year-old daughter
died after a tornado struck a mobile home in Gretna, Neb.
   Wind clocked at 81 mph broke up a car show Sunday near Rockford,
Ill., by tossing tents, debris, and portable toilets.
   ``One outhouse flew right past me and then I got hit by another
one as I was running away,'' said Dwight Dunlop, 21.
   Thunderstorms packing winds of up to 70 mph rolled across Ohio
on Monday, dropping hail, knocking down trees and power lines, and
blowing over airplanes at the Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland.
   There were reports of tornadoes in western Cuyahoga County in
northeast Ohio and in Butler County in southwest Ohio, but the
National Weather Service said they could not be confirmed.
   Quarter-sized hail fell Monday in east-central Indiana, and hail
and heavy rain halted traffic on Interstate 70 near Greensburg,
authorities said. The weather service warned residents in part of
Rush County to seek shelter in reinforced buildings because of hail
driven by 40 mph winds.
   High winds knocked down trees Monday afternoon near Alpena in
northeast Michigan. Pea- and marble-sized hail was reported across
much of the state's Lower Peninsula.
   About 2,300 homes and businesses in the Grand Rapids area and an
additional 2,000 in the Lansing area were left without electrical
service Monday from storms that first reached the state late
Sunday, Consumers Power Co. spokesman Paul Knopick said.
   At least 160 reports of thunderstorms with wind gusts over 50
mph, some with baseball-sized hail, occurred Sunday from Texas to
Minnesota.
   Several thousand homes lost electricity for several hours Sunday
in Iowa, and in the Chicago area, winds gusting up to 55 mph
blacked out 40,000 customers, utilities reported.
   An air traffic controller at Chicago's Midway Airport complained
of a duststorm as strong winds swept through the city. Midway and
O'Hare airport officials said some flights were delayed.
   In north-central Wisconsin, two people were hospitalized with
injuries Sunday after high winds with rain and hail struck their
mobile homes in Marathon County. A woman was injured Sunday night
when a mobile home was blown over in Wabash County, in northern
Indiana, police said.

<TEXT>
   Aldabra tortoises rarely breed in
captivity, but three have been born at Ocean World in the last two
months because of its stress-free environment, a breeder says.
   Zoomer Jr., born March 31, has almost doubled his 40-gram weight
and now weighs 78 grams. His brother, the month-old Hatchback, has
increased in weight from 31 grams to nearly 67 grams. Caylith, born
last week, weighs 40 grams.
   The hatching is a rare event in captivity, said Ed Chapman, a
Miami breeder of rare reptiles.
   The marine park's success can be attributed to a soothing
environment where the tortoises don't have to worry about goats
eating them or about being served up as a delicacy, as in their
native Seychelles Islands, Chapman said recently.
   ``Stress is an important thing with reptiles,'' he said. ``It
affects their growth, and it affects their fertility. If wild
tortoises are disturbed, they will still lay eggs, but the eggs
won't be fertile.''
   In the wild, tortoises take about 25 to 30 years to reach their
adult weight of 500 pounds, Chapman said.
   ``We're hoping that by feeding them lots of good vegetable
protein, such as cactus, they'll reach their full size in about 15
years,'' he said. ``If we can get them to mature and reproduce
faster than they do in the wild, then we will have learned
something valuable for tortoise breeders.''

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says that
despite the wishes of almost the entire Senate, state and local
governments are in a better position than the federal government to
handle the nation's drunken drivers.
   Koop attended a news conference Monday at which several
lawmakers handed the surgeon general a letter signed by 99 senators
asking that he declare drunken driving a ``national crisis.''
   Koop acknowledged that intoxicated drivers are ``the direct
cause of far too many tragedies in our homes and neighborhoods.''
But he said he believed there was little the federal government can
do.
   ``We can talk about things that can be done about it, but unless
we have on every level of state and municipal government a tougher
policy with those people who are guilty of drunk driving, then we
are never going to succeed,'' Koop said.
   ``And the people who can bring that about are the grass-roots
people in this country,'' he said.
   In their letter, the senators wrote that about 24,000 people are
killed and 43,000 seriously injured in alcohol-related automobile
accidents each year.
   ``We urge you to focus national attention on this slaughter on
our highways by declaring drunk driving to be a `national
crisis,''' the letter said.
   Such a declaration would have no legal force, but would focus
publicity on the problem.
   The letter was signed at the news conference by 12-year-old
Charlene Boyette of Hopkins, S.C., whose father was killed in an
accident involving a drunken driver in 1986.
   Koop said that on June 15, a member of his staff will begin
developing a plan his office can use to support efforts by citizens
groups to reduce drunken driving. He declined to say what the
initiative would be.
   When pressed by reporters on whether he would declare the
``national crisis'' requesed by the senators, Koop said, ``I don't
think it takes a surgeon general to declare a crisis when everybody
knows there is a crisis.''
   He also said he felt ``a little bit put upon by people not in
the government to assume responsibilities that are not mine and
that I don't believe I can usurp.''
   Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who wrote
the letter to Koop, both said at the news conference that they were
satisfied with what the surgeon general said he would do.
   The only senator who did not sign the letter to Koop is Joseph
Biden, D-Del., who is recuperating from surgery on an artery that
leads to his brain.

   Jane Amsterdam, founding editor of
Manhattan,inc. magazine, will be named editor of the New York Post,
a spokesman for the Post said Monday.
   Howard J. Rubenstein, the spokesman, said the Post will make an
announcement Tuesday naming Ms. Amsterdam, 36, to the position. She
will start work in about a month, he said.
   She will replace Frank Devine, who is expected to leave by the
end of the year, Rubenstein said.
   Devine stayed on after Rupert Murdoch sold the paper in March to
Peter S. Kalikow, the real-estate developer, who made Peter O.
Price publisher.
   Ms. Amsterdam was an editor in the Style section and the
investigative unit of The Washington Post, and executive editor at
New Times, American Lawyer and New York magazines.
   She is generally credited with making a success of
Manhattan,inc., which was founded in 1984 as an upscale city
magazine that treated top business executives as celebrities.
   She resigned in March 1987 after a disagreement over editorial
autonomy with the owner of the magazine, D. Herbert Lipson. In
January, she joined Knopf as a senior editor.
   According to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Ms.
Amsterdam would become the sixth woman currently holding the
position of top editor at a newspaper with a circulation of more
than 100,000.
   The Post is the nation's oldest continually published daily
newspaper.

departed officials in the Reagan White House and from interviews
with two of President Reagan's children who have published books:
   Michael K. Deaver, former deputy White House chief of staff in
``Behind the Scenes,'' (1987):
   ``At times, Ronald Reagan has been very much a puzzle to me. I
had never known anyone so unable to deal with close personal
conflict. When problems arose related to the family or with the
personnel in his office, Nancy had to carry the load.''

Failed,'' (1986):
   ``What do you do when your president ignores all the palpable,
relevant facts and wanders in circles? I could not bear to watch
this good and decent man go on in this embarrassing way.''
   And: ``Regan (as treasury secretary) has given him unlimited bad
advice for years and years by essentially echoing and telling the

   Larry Speakes, former press secretary, in ``Speaking Out,''

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Numero will get his University of
Minnesota law school diploma Sunday, 60 years after a bureaucratic
technicality prevented him from joining his classmates at
graduation.
   ``I expected to graduate with my class and get my diploma,''
said the 91-year-old Minneapolis resident, who went on to a
successful career in business.
   ``I even bought a cap and gown, you know. But at the last moment
Dean Fraser told me there was bad news, that I couldn't get my law
degree because I didn't meet all the requirements and there was
nothing he could do about it.
   ``I didn't even show up to watch graduation.''
   He wasn't allowed to graduate because he didn't have an
undergraduate degree.
   According to university records, Numero was admitted to law
school several years after returning from World War I, even though
he technically was short of meeting undergraduate requirements.
   Dean Everett Fraser, father of Mayor Don Fraser, told him he
would get credit for an officer's training program.
   But other university officials disagreed and rejected Fraser's
request.
   Despite being denied a law degree, Numero passed the bar exam
and worked in law a few years, mainly as his own attorney in
business deals.
   Business turned out highly lucrative for Numero, the founder of
the Bloomington-based Thermo King transport refrigeration company.
   The law school disappointment became just a faded memory until
current Dean Robert Stein heard about the story and saw a way to
honor him at the school's 100th commencement.
   Stein wrote Numero a letter asking for the privilege of
presenting ``a long overdue diploma.''
   ``We work hard to have a fine line between sort of a dignified
occasion, because this is an important rite of passage, and a warm
family feeling,'' Stein said.
   ``It seems to us that honoring Joe Numero is going to help us
accomplish that balance. I think it's time to make the formal
record agree with reality.''

George Rose died from head injuries sustained in a car crash,
according an autopsy.
   The autopsy was conducted after Rose's adopted son, Juan Rose,
asked police to investigate the actor's death last week in a
one-car accident on a road between the north-coast towns of Sosua
and Puerto Plata.
   The autopsy report, made available Monday, said Rose, 68, died
from head injuries caused by a blunt surface.
   The pathologists who prepared the report also said the autopsy,
an examination of the evidence and an inspection of the crash site
indicate ``the manner of death was accidental.''
   Police said Rose, winner of two Tony awards on Broadway for his
roles in ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' and ``My Fair Lady,'' was
killed Wednesday night when his speeding car swerved into a ditch
and flipped over several times.

   Raymond Burr, who has successfully revived
his role as Perry Mason for television movies, recalls with some
bitterness his treatment and the character during the CBS series'
heyday.
   ``Mason never once, in nine years, had a sense of humor,'' he
said. ``Mason never once, in nine years, had a single good friend.''
   During the Mason years, 1957-1966, Burr lived in a spartan
bungalow at the studio to save travel time, rising at 3:30 a.m. and
quitting work at 7:30 p.m., he said in an interview published in
next week's TV Guide.
   Near the end of his ninth season, he orally agreed to a 10th and
final season. Then he read in a newspaper the series had been
canceled.
   ``Nothing about that end was nice,'' he said. ``I had a watch on
that they'd bought for Mason five or six years before, which I wore
on the show, and I was in my dressing room for no more than 10
minutes (after the last scene) before they came over and asked for
the watch.
   ``I gave them the watch and never saw any of them again,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Rebels Due To Get Cash Instead of Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States plans to send cash payments
to Contra rebels inside Nicaragua that will enable them to buy food
locally while a dispute over resettlement keeps them from receiving
food and other supplies, an administration official says.
   The payments will range between 50 cents and $1 a day for
thousands of Contra fighters _ ``enough to keep body and soul
together,'' according to the official, who spoke Monday on the
condition that he not be identified.
   A final decision will be made later in the week by Alan Woods,
administrator of the Agency for International Development, the
official said.
   After the Contras and Nicaragua's leftist government signed a
temporary truce on March 23, Congress approved a $47.9 million
humanitarian aid package for the rebels, consistent with a
provision in the truce agreement.
   The legislation permits deliveries of food, clothing, shelter
and medical supplies and medical care for children who are war
victims.
   The agreement specified that the rebels receive the aid after
resettling in seven mutually agreed cease-fire zones.
   However, no food or other supplies have been sent inside
Nicaragua because a dispute over ground rules within the zones has
prevented the resettlement from taking place.
   This has left some Contra units with acute food shortages. Air
drops have been ruled out because of fear that Sandinista fighters
might shoot down the planes used to transport the food.
   At the time of the truce, there were an estimated 12,000 Contras
inside Nicaragua but many have fled into Honduras in search of food.
   The monthly cost of the payments is expected to be between
$60,000 to $450,000, depending on availability of Contra couriers
based in Honduras to deliver the cash and the number of rebels
inside Nicaragua that can be reached at any given time. Most of the
payments will be in cordobas, Nicaragua's currency.
   In addition, AID has earmarked more than $300,000 per month in
family assistance payments to rebels with technical skills. Part of
the funds are being assigned to resistance personnel who work at
Contra offices in Miami.
   Nicaraguan authorities maintain that any humanitarian assistance
sent to the Contras without prior inspection by an officially
designated verification commission would be illegal under the truce
agreement.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has objected vigorously to an
interim program under which U.S.-sponsored aid is being sent by
truck or air drop from Tegucigalpa to Contra camps on the Honduran
side of the border.
   The bulk of this aid _ 262 metric tons _ has been sent by truck,
the official said. The administration has denied Ortega's claims
that the shipments have contained lethal equipment, insisting that
the deliveries have received prior inspection from Honduran church
officials.
   The cease-fire began on April 1 and is schedued to last for 60
days. During this period, the Sandinistas and the Contras are to
negotiate terms for a permanent cease-fire. But little progress has
been made in the talks.

   The wife of soul singer James Brown was
arrested and charged with setting a small fire in their hotel room.
   Adrienne Brown, 38, was charged Monday with criminal mischief
and arson, police said. Suspected drugs were taken from her room
and are being tested at a police lab, authorities said. Her
husband, 54, was not arrested.
   Mrs. Brown was released on $2,000 bond and was scheduled for a

   Deputy police Chief David Bailey said Mrs. Brown was arrested
after employees at the Sheraton Tara Wayfarer Hotel put out the
small fire in the Brown's room.
   The Browns, from Aiken, S.C., were in the state for a weekend
concert at the Cheshire Fair grounds, which also featured rock
legend Chuck Berry.
   Last month, Brown was charged in Aiken with assault with intent
to kill his wife. She has since asked that the charges be dropped.
A week after the alleged assault, Mrs. Brown was charged with
possession of PCP.

   House Speaker Jim Wright has set a June 21

   Wright, D-Texas, denied the move was an election-year ploy,

Congress passed two years ago, just before the last election.
   ``Anything we do that people like'' is denigrated as motivated

lawmakers. ``We cannot sit by as the United States loses the war

   Wright said the legislation to be completed next month would be
similar to proposals the Senate has attached to other legislation,
with money for programs such as treatment of addicts, law

   ``We'll see how much it takes and then we'll find ways to pay

to modernize India's busiest railroad lines.
   The $1.2 billion project will upgrade 2,400 miles of track

New Delhi _ the Bank said in an announcement Monday.
   These routes carry about three-quarters of India's massive

278 million tons of freight, the announcement said.
   The plan calls for modernization and improvements in capacity,
fuel and locomotive usage and maintenance, said World Bank

   The 20-year loan carries a variable interest rate, currently
7.72 percent, linked to the cost of World Bank borrowing.

   Donald Regan's publisher weren't able to deliver the former
White House insider's new book fast enough, retailers say.
   By midday Monday, spot checks around the country showed many
booksellers had not received the book, ``For the Record: from Wall
Street to Washington,'' which tattles on first lady Nancy Reagan's
stargazing. Many said readers were clamoring for the $21.95 book.
   Three big bookstores in midtown Manhattan, and shops in Miami,
Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Boston and Brentwood, Calif., said they
were awaiting shipments. Two of four bookstores contacted in Kansas
City, Mo., had received the books.
   Bookstores in Washington, D.C., were flooded with calls about
the book, but many outlets were waiting for delivery.
   ``It's doing great,'' said Robert Haft, president of Crown
Books, which has 52 retail stores in Washington. ``Unfortunately,
today is the first day it is available and it hasn't even arrived
at some of our stores yet. They had very tight security on the book
and didn't want any stores to have it until today.''
   Regan says in the book President Reagan ``laid down no rules and
articulated no missions'' while his wife presided over a ``shadowy
distaff presidency'' influenced by astrological advice.
   Oxford Books, one of Atlanta's largest bookstores, was awaiting
100 copies, said Kitty Moran, the store's general manager.
   ``We've had five calls so far this morning, but we don't know
when we're going to get the book,'' said clerk Marlene Blumberg of
Doubleday Book Shop in Miami. But another shop in Miami said it had
had no requests.
   Shipments were due Saturday for 15 stores of Kroch's Brentano's
Inc. in the Chicago area, but hadn't arrived by Monday afternoon.
   ``We've gotten a lot of calls about the book. We have six people
taking calls and I handled four or five calls. That's a lot for a
new book,'' said a spokeswoman at one of the Brentano stores.
   At Dutton's Books in Brentwood, Calif., a customer with a
special interest was turned away because books hadn't arrived.
``We've been getting requests for it. The first two people who
walked in this morning asked for it, but one was a personal friend
of both of them (the Reagans). I better not say their name,'' said
Doug Dutton, who said 25 copies were on order.
   Jo Feldman, manager of B. Dalton Booksellers in King of Prussia,
Pa., said at mid-morning Monday that she hadn't received the 20
books on order.
   At Barnes and Noble in New York City, Alex Ostrowsky said he had
sold 17 copies by mid-morning.
   Clair Wachtel, coordinating editor for the project at Regan's
publisher, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, said her information
indicated the books were getting to the stores as expected. They
were not to be delivered until Monday because Harcourt Brace had
sold reprint rights to Time magazine, which went on sale Monday.
   ``We were worried on Friday that the books might be shipped
early,'' she said.

   Kean has been in the forefront among governors in implementing

   The meeting was scheduled to last one hour, but Kean said he was

   Foreigners, like Americans, are titillated and
amused by revelations in former White House official Don Regan's
book, but some experts say the out-of-school memoir is more than a
laughing matter for the United States abroad.
   ``There is no doubt that his type of so-called revelations are
harmful because ... they give foreigners the impression that U.S.
officials are not to be trusted,'' says Richard Helms, the former
CIA director. ``This tends to erode their credibility.''
   Regan was White House chief of staff until he was forced out in
early 1987, reportedly after a feud with first lady Nancy Reagan.
His book, ``For the Record,'' depicts President Reagan as a passive
president loathe to make decisions and manipulated by a wife held
hostage to the stars.
   Books like Regan's ``diminish the president's stature, and for
the rest of the Western world, so much depends on the president's
prestige,'' said Henry Brandon, longtime Washington correspondent
for the London Sunday Times and now a visiting scholar at the
Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank.
   With a U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow less than a month away, one
Soviet scholar said the book _ particularly details of Mrs.
Reagan's penchant for astrology _ provides fodder for the Russian
propaganda machine.
   Perhaps more damaging, though, is that the revelations may
reinforce the perception Soviets have of Americans as a weird,
superstitious and somewhat untrustworthy breed, said Jerry Hough, a
professor at Duke University and the author of a just-published
book, ``Russia and the West: Gorbachev and the Politics of Reform.''
   The stargazing passages ``confirm a picture of America that is a
strange and, in many respects, a not totally rational place,''
Hough said. Daily horoscopes are not a regular feature in the
Soviet newspapers, as they are in many American and European
publications.
   Soviets have long been concerned that the United States is ``not
a reliable partner'' because of Congress' failure to ratify the
SALT II treaty, among other things, Hough said.
   Regan's book won't make it any easier for U.S. officials to
accomplish their goals at the coming summit, he said.
   On the other hand, Hough said the administration has lowered
expectations about the summit to such a degree that Regan's book
could have little impact.
   Several people said Regan's often scornful picture of what goes
on behind the gates at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue comes too late in
the Reagan presidency to do any real harm to his administration or
to the United States.
   Many foreign governments are biding their time until the next
president takes office anyway, they say.
   The Soviet Embassy was closed Monday to celebrate the World War
II victory over Germany, but Valentin Falin, the chairman of
Novisti, the government-controlled press agency, made that point in
a recent interview.
   The U.S. government is virtually crippled with indecision during
an election year because no one knows what the future holds, he
said.
   Helms disagreed. ``There is no reason why he can't make foreign
policy decisions,'' he said.
   Put in context, Regan's book is not nearly as serious for U.S.
foreign policy as, for instance, the Iran-Contra affair in which
weapons were secretly sold to Iran with profits diverted to the
Nicaraguan rebels, said Brandon.
   Diplomats at several embassies declined to be quoted by name in
talking about the Regan flap for fear of offending the United
States. A few chuckled, but none considered the damage to the U.S.
image to be too serious.
   ``George Shultz might joke about it on the golf course with Bob
Hawke,'' said an Australian, referring to the secretary of state
and the Australian prime minister, respectively. ``It makes you
look a bit silly,'' he said.
   Herman Nickel, the former U.S. ambassador to South Africa in the
Reagan administration, said books like Regan's are ``not helpful in
a general sense'' to Americans trying to carry out the
administration's policies abroad.
   At the same time, he said foreigners understand that ``people
with a grudge tend to tell their stories.''
   While diplomats were cautious, foreign reporters had a heyday
with the story.
   ``People abroad think this is just another giggle,'' said Elgy
Gillespie, who writes for the Irish Times in Dublin. ``It's just
one more hilarious thing about the Reagans, isn't it?''
   Europeans have often mocked the Reagans for their California
tastes and their ``glizerati friends at the White House,'' she
said. ``What are we going to do for kicks if kiss-and-tell books
are ever barred?''

   A federal appeals court has upheld the
dismissal of a libel suit against The New Yorker magazine brought
by a man who said he was unfairly portrayed in an article about
another libel case.
   Greg Rushford, a former congressional committee investigator,
sued The New Yorker over an article by Renata Adler about former
Army Gen. William C. Westmoreland's libel lawsuit against CBS News.
   Rushford, a witness at the trial of Westmoreland's suit, said
the article unfairly portrayed him as being thought of by a judge
as ``far out'' or a ``kook.''
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. dismissed Rushford's
suit last year, saying Adler's article was ``no more than the
author's opinion.''
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the dismissal on Monday.
   ``There is nothing in the record before us from which we could
infer malice,'' said the ruling by Judges Francis D. Murnaghan Jr,
Kenneth K. Hall and James Dickson Phillips Jr.
   Westmoreland's lawsuit, which stemmed from a CBS documentary on
his role in the Vietnam war, was settled out of court before its
trial ended.

   The gang film ``Colors'' was the box office
winner last weekend despite a sluggish period that saw moviemakers
preparing for the Memorial Day holiday blockbuster blitz.
   Moviegoing traditionally slows down in the weeks before Memorial
Day and ``business was flat'' last week, said John Krier of
Exhibitor Relations Co., which surveys box office revenues.
   ``This is one of the slowest periods of the year. Everything is
standing neutral until the blockbusters come at the end of the
month,'' said Krier.
   Booming attendance is anticipated with the release later this
month of the George Lucas-Ron Howard film ``Willow'' and two
sequels, ``Rambo III'' and ``Crocodile Dundee II.''
   Meanwhile, ghosts and cops were the themes for five of the
weekend's top six films.
   ``Colors,'' with Sean Penn as a cocky rookie cop teamed with the
savvy veteran Robert Duvall, took in $4 million in its fourth week
of release.
   Michael Keaton's role as an exorcist in the hereafter comedy
``Beetlejuice'' was second with a $3.3 million take.
   ``Shakedown,'' featuring Sam Elliott as an undercover cop
helping to expose corrupt colleagues, was third with $3 million and
``Salsa,'' a torrid romance throbbing to a Latin beat, was fourth
with $2.6 million.
   ``Dead Heat,'' a story about a policeman killed in the line of
duty then brought back to life for 12 hours to find his killer,
rang in $1.6 million to place fifth and ``Above the Law,''
featuring a Chicago cop's drug-ring battle, was sixth with $1.44
million.
   ``Biloxi Blues,'' starring Matthew Broderick as an Army private,
took in $1.4 million to place seventh.
   ``The Last Emperor,'' Bernardo Bertolucci's epic that won nine
Academy Awards, with eighth with $1.2 million.
   The teen-oriented film ``Casual Sex?'' was ninth with $1.18
million and rounding out the top 10 was ``Moonstruck,'' which took
in $1.1 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release, and estimated production costs when available.
   1. ``Colors,'' Orion, $4 million, 1,386 screens, $2,891 per
screen, $25 million, four weeks, $12 million.
   2. ``Beetlejuice,'' Warner Bros., $3.35 million, 1,569 screens,
$2,104 per screen, $51.22 million, six weeks, $20 million.
   3. ``Shakedown,'' Universal, $3.01 million, 1,580 screens,
$1,910 per screen, $3.01 million, one week, n-a.
   4. ``Salsa,'' Cannon, $2.62 million, 1,125 screens, $2,335 per

   A Pennsylvania couple says relatives
thought they had gone off the deep end when they began commuting
625 miles to weekend jobs at the Opryland USA amusement park.
   Joe and Twila Uzmack of Knox, Pa., leave their home every Friday
morning and drive to Nashville, where they work in an Opryland
information booth on Saturdays.
   ``Some people think we're crazy, but we really love it here,''
Uzmack, a 62-year-old retired education, said recently.
   The Uzmacks have been dividing their time between Pennsylvania
and Tennessee for eight years. Uzmack saw an Opryland help-wanted
ad a few years ago and suggested to his wife that they apply.
   ``I told him they wouldn't hire people our age, but within 15
minutes we were hired,'' said 58-year-old Mrs. Uzmack, who taught
elementary school for 25 years. ``We told them we wanted to meet
people so they placed us in the information booth.''
   Last year, the couple stayed at their Nashville retirement home.
But a few months ago, Uzmack was asked to act as temporary
superintendent of a Pennsylvania school district.
   ``That is one of the reasons we are commuting this year,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Uzmack said the drive ``isn't bad. We enjoy it. It's a
break and gives us something different to do, but occasionally we
fly.''

   Only 7 percent of married women surveyed by
Ladies Home Journal say they wouldn't marry their mate again.
   The poll of 608 women released Monday found that 88 percent
would wed the same man again. The rest were undecided.
   Their husband's sense of humor was cited as the reason for
falling in love by 49 percent of women surveyed while 39 percent
said they decided to marry him because ``he shared my vision of the
future.''
   The most common reason given for opposing the idea of remarrying
the same man was that the couple had nothing in common, according
to the poll published in the June issue. The magazine said this
complaint was most often heard from readers ages 45 to 59.
   Other problems cited as interfering with marital bliss included
communication problems, a lack of emotional responsiveness and
opposition to a spouse's independence. The magazine said the last
complaint was most often made by women younger than age 30.
   A particular protest of Midwestern women who said they would not
remarry their husbands was, ``he's boring.''
   The Roper organization conducted the poll for the magazine with
telephone and street interviews. The margin of error is 3
percentage points.

<HEAD>American Hostage Thought Freedom Was Near</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American journalist Terry Anderson, the longest
held Western hostage in Lebanon, was convinced a week ago that he
would soon be released.
   Instead, diplomat Marcel Fontaine and two other Frenchmen were
freed.
   ``I am very sad, because I spent the last six months with
Terry,'' Fontaine told Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, during a
meeting Monday at his home outside Paris. ``Terry thought he would
be let out before me. And I told Terry to tell my family what I am
telling you now.''
   Fontaine, 45, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
captors Wednesday along with fellow diplomat Marcel Carton and
journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann. The three returned to France on
Thursday after nearly three years in captivity.
   Anderson, 40, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press and one of nine Americans missing in Lebanon, was
abducted March 16, 1985, in West Beirut.
   ``They (the captors) said either Terry Anderson will be out
first or Fontaine will be out first,'' Fontaine said.
   On May 3, a guard told Anderson to prepare his things, Fontaine
said.
   ``At midnight, they took Terry away and I stayed alone in the
room. At two in the morning, somebody came and asked me if I knew.
I said no. He said: `Well, you'll be free this morning at 7
o'clock.'''
   Fontaine, looking thin and pale, said he felt fine. He told of
his experiences in the living room of his home with his wife and
three sons.
   Fontaine said the greatest fear he and Anderson had was that
their governments would attempt a rescue raid.
   ``When somebody knocked on the door, two guards immediately
stepped in, pointed guns at us and waited for whoever was going to
come in. There is no chance that any commandos would ever get in
without us being killed.''
   Another fear was falling ill. ``We had no right to see a
doctor,'' he said.
   Anderson does not know that his father and brother have died.
Fontaine said he himself knew, because he had heard it earlier on
the radio, but he didn't tell his cellmate because he did not want
him to be depressed.
   ``For Terry, his father is still alive.''
   Once last year, in a fit of frustration, Anderson beat his head
against the wall until the blood flowed down his face.
   ``I couldn't stop him because he is strong. I called the jailers
who were stronger. I told Terry to think of your wife and think of
your family.''
   Fontaine said none of the hostages received letters. They were
not allowed to read newspapers or listen to the news on television
or radio.
   They did, however, watch the Miss USA pageant on television, he
said.
   ``Mentally, Terry has no problems. We watched the women on
television. We were always laughing about it. We saw the Miss USA
pageant. It was Miss Texas who won. He voted for Miss Michigan, and
me for Miss Mississippi.''
   Fontaine said he thought Anderson would survive.
   ``He's very courageous. The last time, when I was a little sick
and dispirited, I said to Terry that I'm not afraid to die, but I
don't want to die here and have them throw my body into the sea
like they did with (hostage William) Buckley.
   ``Terry said: `I don't want to die anywhere.'''

   The U.S. dollar finished lower against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo Tuesday, while stock prices rose moderately.
   The dollar closed at 124.63 yen, down 0.24 yen from its close of
124.87 yen on Monday. It had opened the day at 124.78 yen and
traded between 124.55 and 124.79 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a big 223.47-point loser Monday, gained 147.95
points, or 0.53 percent, to end the day at 27,412.25.
   ``The dollar has been stable without any market affecting
news,'' said an official of a major commercial bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said trading was thin as many market participants
stayed on the sidelines to await a refunding auction of U.S.
Treasury bonds scheduled to start in the United States later
Tuesday.
   Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako Securities said, ``The decline the past
three consecutive trading days made share prices attractive for
investors.''
   The main market barometer had dropped a total of 405.42 points
during the three previous trading days.

   A judge denied a defense motion for a
mistrial Monday even though a prospective juror said his mind was
made up in the trial of a man accused of killing 16 people,
including 14 family members.
   R. Gene Simmons, 47, is on trial for murder in two Dec. 28
shootings in Russellville. He still must face trial on the
Christmas season slayings of his relatives at his home near Dover.
   A dozen jurors and two alternates were seated Monday in Franklin
County Circuit Court. Opening statements were scheduled to begin
Tuesday.
   Prosecuting attorney John Bynum said the state's first witness
would be Russellville Police Chief Herb Johnston, to whom Simmons
surrendered after the Russellville shootings.
   As jury selection began, potential juror Jack Morton of Ozark
told Judge John Patterson, in front of about 100 other prospective
jurors: ``I know too much. I've been working down around Dover a
little bit. I've got my mind already made up.''
   Patterson said potential jurors would be asked later about what
they had heard about the case.
   ``I've not heard about it,'' Morton said. ``I've been down there
with the people.''
   While Patterson was telling Morton to stop talking, defense
attorney Robert E. Irwin was objecting and making motions to quash
the panel of prospective jurors and to declare a mistrial.
   Patterson denied the motions, saying no harm had been done.
   Simmons is charged with two counts of capital murder in the
deaths of former co-worker Kathy C. Kendrick, 24, who officials say
spurned his advances a year before she was killed, and James D.
Chaffin, 33, who police say was a chance victim during a 45-minute
shooting spree. If convicted of either count, the sentence is life
without parole or death.
   Simmons also faced five counts of attempted murder and one count
of kidnapping in the trial. The defense asked Patterson to dismiss
those counts, but he refused.
   Patterson set a July 18 trial for Simmons on capital murder
charges in the deaths of 14 family members. Simmons was arrested
Dec. 28 after deputies found two of Simmons' children and their
spouses shot to death and an 11-year-old granddaughter strangled.
   The next day, police dug into a shallow, kerosene-soaked grave
and found seven bodies, including those of Simmons' other children
and his wife, Becky.
   Police also found the bodies of two infant boys in garbage sacks
in the trunks of abandoned cars on Simmons' property. The babies
were strangled.
   Jury selection proceeded in a room apart from the courtroom.
Potential jurors were summoned one at a time and questioned
individually.
   At times, as many as 10 policemen were in the second-floor
courtroom in the two-story Franklin County courthouse.
   Cameras are allowed in the courtroom only during recesses,
Patterson decided.
   Patterson excused nine potential jurors for cause, generally
because they said they had concluded due to pretrial publicity that
Simmons was guilty. The state excused seven prospective jurors and
the defense only one.

   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould has given
birth to a boy in the hospital where she delivered a girl under a
surrogate mother contract two years ago.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 31, gave birth at Monmouth Medical Center
on Monday without complications, said hospital spokeswoman Jane
Hollander.
   The boy is Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's fourth child. His father is
Dean Gould, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's second husband.
   ``I'm just very happy,'' Gould said. ``We haven't decided on a
name yet.''
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould asked the hospital not to release the boy's
weight, said Hollander.
   In the highly publicized battle for custody of Baby M, the girl
Mrs. Whitehead-Gould bore under contract, the New Jersey Supreme
Court on Feb. 3 granted permanent custody to the girl's father,
William Stern.
   The court also outlawed surrogacy for pay and restored Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's parental rights to the 2-year-old girl legally
known as Melissa Stern.
   The girl lives with Stern and his wife, Elizabeth. A Superior
Court judge on April 6 granted Mrs. Whitehead-Gould gradually
expanded, unsupervised visits with Melissa.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf War Good Business For Ship Repair Yards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Persian Gulf repair yard that serviced
two U.S. vessels damaged as a result of the Iran-Iraq war said it
made a profit for the first time last year.
   The Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard said in its annual report
that 1987 was its best year since it opened a decade ago in the
Persian Gulf.
   The drydock in neighboring Dubai, the largest repair facility in
the Middle East, reported earlier that its business also has
increased.
   Iran and Iraq, which have waged war for 7{ years, in the last
year have intensified their attacks on gulf shipping.
   The Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard's annual report,
distributed by the Gulf News Agency, gave no detailed breakdown of
its profits.
   But two major operations undertaken last year included repairing
the U.S. frigate Stark, which was badly damaged May 17 in an Iraqi
air strike that killed 37 sailors. Iraq said the attack was
launched when a fighter-bomber pilot mistook the frigate for an
Iranian warship.
   The other repair operation was on the American-owned supertanker
Texaco Carribean, which was damaged just outside the gulf in August
by a mine believed planted by Iran.
   Mohammed Khateeb, secretary of the yard's board of directors,
earlier told the gulf magazine Arab Ad that the company earned $22
million last year compared to $11.3 million in 1986, ``thanks to
two major contracts.''
   The magazine said the Texaco Carribean was one, but did not name
the Stark.
   It did not specify how many of those vessels were casualties of
the so-called ``tanker war'' between Iran and Iraq.
   Coupled with a worldwide shipping recession over recent years,
shipping experts said the war has scared off an estimated 40
percent of the vessels that once used the waterway.
   Iraq's gulf ports also have been closed since the early days of
the conflict.
   The Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard was set up in 1978 by
seven of the 10 members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries: Bahrain, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Libya.
   About 500 merchant ships in the gulf have been hit in air and
sea attacks as well as mines since early 1984. The USS Samuel B.
Roberts, the second U.S. warship to suffer serious damage in the
gulf, was taken to Dubai for repairs after it was damaged by a mine
last month.

<HEAD>Government Signs Peace Pact With Sinhalese Extremists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today signed a peace
accord with a Sinhalese extremist group to end a terrorist campaign
that has taken at least 260 lives, officials announced.
   Lalith Athulathmudali, Sri Lanka's national security minister,
told a news conference that the agreement calls for members of the
Sinhalese Peoples' Liberation Front to give up their arms and cease
guerrilla attacks.
   In exchange, he said, the government agreed to lift its ban on
the front and release all of the group's members from detention
except those charged with murder or attempted murder.
   The agreement was signed by Athulathmudali and Rohanna
Wijeweera, leader of the group, at an undisclosed location.
   Front members are to surrender all arms by May 29 at four
Buddhist temples, Athulathmudali said. Insurgency activities were
to end immediately, he said.
   The front has been blamed for killing 260 politicians, soldiers
and government officials since July.
   The Peoples' Liberation Front launched its campaign to show
opposition to a peace accord signed July 29 to try to end the
minority Tamils' separatist campaign in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka.
   The front contended that the pact made too many concessions to
the Tamils.
   Tamil militants have been fighting since 1983 for more political
autonomy or an independent homeland, claiming they are
discriminated against by the island's majority Sinhalese.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
island's 16 million population. The Sinhalese, who are Buddhists,
comprise about 75 percent. The rest are Christian descendants of
Western colonalists or Moslem descendants of early Arab traders.
   India, which has an estimated 60 million ethnic Tamils in its
southern states, brokered the July accord, which calls for the Sri
Lankan Tamils to lay down their arms in exchange for new regional
councils that will give them some say in local government
activities.
   But the largest of the rebel groups, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, rejected the accord. India has sent more than 50,000
troops to the island to put down the Tigers' rebellion.
   The Peoples' Liberation Front has a long history of
anti-government activities. It was outlawed after an abortive 1971
effort to overthrow the Sri Lankan government, but it began
regrouping in 1986 and 1987.
   Initially a radical Marxist group, it became the underground
champion of the island's majority Sinhalese.
   The group has been blamed for two recent attacks on Sri Lankan
military installations and the assassinations of several candidates
for recently held local elections in southern Sri Lanka.

   A woman was found guilty of killing her husband
and a woman to collect more than $175,000 in insurance, and the
prosecutor says the conviction in the nation's first
death-by-product-tampering trial will stop drug tamperers.
   Stella Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn, was convicted Monday of
all five counts in the deaths of her 52-year-old husband, Bruce,
and Sue Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn.
   Federal court jurors, who deliberated nearly five days, said
Mrs. Nickell's daughter's testimony against her mother proved
crucial. Mrs. Nickell, scheduled for sentencing June 17, could
receive life in prison. Prosecutors also are considering state
murder charges.
   ``It was all there for (jurors) to make this decision,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida said, adding that the verdict
will ``be a deterrent'' to would-be drug tamperers.
   Jury foreman Murray M. Andrews, 55, said the panel was split
11-1 in favor of conviction through its first three votes.
   The testimony of Cindy Hamilton, Mrs. Nickell's 28-year-old
daughter, was decisive. ``I think without Cindy's testimony there
were, you might say, too many missing links in the chain of
evidence,'' he said.
   Ms. Hamilton testified her mother discussed killing Nickell by a
drug overdose or by hiring a hit man.
   Although prosecutors were unable to link Mrs. Nickell directly
to cyanide purchases, she was convicted of all five counts she
faced, two of causing death by tampering with a product involved in
interstate commerce and three of tampering.
   Beset by financial problems and unhappy in her marriage, Mrs.
Nickell laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules with cyanide and
gave them to her husband for a headache, prosecutors said.
   To make his death appear random, she poisoned other bottles of
Excedrin and Anacin capsules and put them on store shelves. Ms.
Snow died after swallowing capsules from one of those bottles, six
days after Nickell, the prosecution said.
   Her husband, Paul Webking, said she might still be alive if
local authorities had recognized the real cause of Nickell's death,
initially attributed to emphysema.
   ``The effect of the verdict is secondary to the fact that Sue is
dead,'' Webking said. ``No matter what the verdict is, Sue's going
to be dead.''
   ``I wish they'd hang her to the highest tree,'' said Ms. Snow's
mother, Marion Chapman, in a telephone interview from Artesia, N.M.
   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng said he would wait until
after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges.
   The deaths of Nickell and Ms. Snow touched off a nationwide
tampering scare and prompted Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to
recall its capsuled, non-prescription medicines.
   ``Product tampering is intolerable to society,'' John Weisberg,
spokesman for New York-based Bristol-Myers, said. ``When it occurs
every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to
bring them to justice,'' he said.
   Seven people died in Chicago in 1982 from cyanide-laced
Extra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved.
   Ms. Maida accused Mrs. Nickell of poisoning her husband to
collect on his life insurance. Public defender Thomas Hillier said
Mrs. Nickell was the victim of a lying daughter who stood to gain a
$300,000 reward from pharmaceutical companies for information
leading to an arrest.
   Mrs. Nickell's plan failed because she was careless in mixing
the poisonous capsules, greedy for insurance benefits and owned two
of the five tainted bottles of painkillers recovered, Ms. Maida
said in closing arguments.
   Mrs. Nickell, a tropical fish enthusiast, used a bowl
contaminated with an algaeicide for cleaning fish tanks when she
mixed potassium cyanide with the Anacin and Excedrin painkillers,
the prosecution alleged.
   Traces of the compound were found in the five tainted bottles.
   Mrs. Nickell also lied about insurance policies and pressed
medical authorities for a more specific cause of death, Ms. Maida
said.
   Mrs. Nickell stood to receive $71,000 in insurance if the death
of her husband was from emphysema, as pathologists first concluded,
but could have gotten $176,000 if the death were ruled accidental,
the prosecutor said.
   Mrs. Nickell also left fingerprints on library books about
poisons and cyanide, Ms. Maida said.

   The 1988 Tony nominations reflected Broadway's
best season in years with more than enough nominees to fill most of
the categories and even to allow for some unexpected omissions.
   As usual, musicals, particularly, Andrew Lloyd Webber's lavish
``Phantom of the Opera,'' Stephen Sondheim's fairy tale ``Into the
Woods'' and a revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes'' dominated
the nominations announced Monday.
   Each of the three shows received 10 nominations, with
``Phantom'' and ``Into the Woods'' going against ``Romance
Romance,'' two small one-act musicals, and the South African
musical ``Sarafina!'' for best musical of the 1987-88 season. Left
out of the nominations was ``Chess,'' the big British musical by
Tim Rice and members of the pop group ABBA. It received only two
acting nominations.
   Nominated for best play were ``Speed-the-Plow,'' David Mamet's
savage look at two would-be Hollywood moguls; ``Joe Turner's Come
and Gone,'' August Wilson's tale of the children of slaves coming
to terms with their past; Lee Blessing's ``A Walk in the Woods,'' a
two-character comedy about American and Soviet arms control
negotiators, and David Henry Hwang's ``M. Butterfly,'' a love story
that has parallels to the Puccini opera ``Madame Butterfly.''
   Denied a best play nomination were Lanford Wilson's contemporary
love story ``Burn This'' and ``Breaking the Code,'' the tragic
story of British mathematical wizard Alan Turing. Also snubbed was
John Malkovich, the critically praised star of ``Burn This.''
Nominations for best actor went instead to Derek Jacobi of
``Breaking the Code''; Robert Prosky, ``A Walk in the Woods''; John
Lithgow of ``M. Butterfly,'' and Ron Silver, ``Speed-the-Plow.''
   The competition was less fierce for the best actress prize.
Glenda Jackson's portrait of Lady Macbeth in a revival of the
Shakespeare tragedy was nominated, along with Joan Allen's
tormented dancer in ``Burn This''; Blythe Danner's portrayal of
Blanche Du Bois in a revival of ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' and
Frances McDormand's Stella Kowalski in the same play.
   Best actress in a musical nominations went to Patti LuPone for
``Anything Goes''; Joanna Gleason of ``Into the Woods''; Judy Kuhn,
the love interest in ``Chess,'' and Alison Fraser of ``Romance
Romance.'' Left out of the running were Sarah Brightman, the
leading lady of ``Phantom'' and Lloyd Webber's wife.
   Her co-star, Michael Crawford, the title character in ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' is the favorite to win the award for best
actor in a musical. His competition is Scott Bakula of ``Romance
Romance''; David Carroll, the Russian grandmaster in ``Chess,'' and
Howard McGillin, an ambitious young stockbroker in Cole Porter's
``Anything Goes.''
   Nominated for best revival were ``A Streetcar Named Desire,''
``Dreamgirls,'' ``Cabaret'' and ``Anything Goes.''
   Harold Prince, the director of ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' is
the top contender for best director of a musical. His competition
is Jerry Zaks, ``Anything Goes''; James Lapine, ``Into the Woods,''
and Mbongeni Ngema, ``Sarafina!''
   The battle for best director of a play pits John Dexter, ``M.
Butterfly''; Gregory Mosher, ``Speed-the-Plow''; Lloyd Richards for
``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' and Clifford Williams, ``Breaking
the Code.''
   The nominees were chosen by a 12-member nominating committee and
will be voted on by 730 members of the drama press and the theater
community. The winners will be announced June 5 during the CBS-TV
broadcast of the 42nd annual Tony awards show.
   The Tonys are named for actress-director Antoinette Perry, who
was active in the American Theater Wing during the 1940s.

   Robert A. Heinlein, who spent a half
century writing about man's relation to technology, society and the
universe, was remembered upon his death at age 80 as science
fiction's prolific ``grand master.''
   ``He was probably the best of us all at his peak,'' Isaac
Asimov, one of the top science fiction writers, said Monday. ``He
forged the route the rest of us followed.
   ``His early stories in the 1940s were so far ahead of everything
else being done that he made an enduring name for himself as the
best science fiction writer.''
   Heinlein, whose books explored the future while questioning the
morals and beliefs of the present, died of heart failure Sunday at
his home in this seaside community 130 miles south of San Francisco.
   Heinlein suffered for years from emphysema and had undergone
numerous operations, including one to relieve restricted blood flow
to his brain.
   Heinlein, a former aviation engineer, dreamed up the water bed
in his 1961 classic ``Stranger in a Strange Land,'' and envisioned
an atomic power plant years before the Manhattan Project. The
current issue of Books in Print lists 64 books written by Heinlein.
More than 40 million copies of his writings have been sold.
   He won the Nebula award from the Science Fiction Writers of
America in 1975; and an unprecedented four Hugo awards, in 1956 for
``Double Star,'' in 1959 for ``Starship Troopers,'' in 1961 for
``Stranger'' and in 1966 for ``The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.''
   His other works include ``The Green Hills of Earth,'' ``The Man
Who Sold the Moon,'' ``Have Space Suit Will Travel,'' and ``Puppet
Masters.''
   ``Heinlein wrote about worlds that people believed in,'' said
Lester del Rey, a science fiction writer-publisher reached at a
convention in Las Vegas, Nev. ``He made them seem real and solid,
real lived-in worlds. His early work was quite extraordinary that
way.''
   Heinlein was born in Butler, Mo., in 1907. He graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy and served for five years, including aboard the
aircraft carrier USS Lexington, but was forced to retire because of
ill health.
   He moved to Los Angeles, unsuccessfully ran for the state
legislature and wrote his first story, ``Lifeline,'' selling it for
$70 to Astounding Magazine.
   Asimov said he and Heinlein served together in Philadelphia
during World War II and ``formed a close friendship which never
entirely broke up.''
   ``Robert Heinlein has been writing science fiction now for 48
years and from the very start he was recognized as a grand
master,'' recalled Asimov. ``In 1975 the Science Fiction Writers of
America set up just such an award, and he was the first to get it.
   ``There was no argument, much like George Washington becoming
the first president.''
   Asimov said his favorite bit of Heinlein writing was the opening
to ``Door Into Summer,'' a story about time travel in which ``he
described a cat better than anyone has ever described a cat.
   ``The work that impressed me the most was `Solution
Unsatisfactory,' written before the Manhattan Project, in which he
accurately described the current nuclear stalemate,'' Asimov said.
   Heinlein's books were written in a spare, matter-of-fact style,
but they presented readers with thoughtful questions about how life
should be lived.
   In the classic ``Stranger in a Strange Land,'' hero Valentine
Michael Smith is a human raised by Martians. But he challenged his
home planet's values with his own priorities, including universal
free love, nudity and many sexual encounters. He also
``discorporated'' or made disappear authority figures he felt were
evil.
   In ``Methuselah's Children'' and in later books, character
Lazarus Long offers this aphorism on how to get a man to help you:
``Never appeal to a man's better nature. He may not have one.
Invoking his self-interest gives you more leverage.''
   In addition to the water bed, another Heinlein invention in
common use is known as a ``waldo,'' for the handicapped hero of the
short story of that title. Waldo invented remote-controlled robot
arms that are used in a variety of delicate and hazardous
manufacturing processes.
   Two years ago, he told writer Eric Hoffman that ``writers don't
know how to retire'' and said he stuck with science fiction because
he did it well and because it sold.
   Heinlein is survived by his wife, Virginia. They had no children.

   The U.S. dollar lost ground in trading against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while stock prices posted a moderate
gain to end a decline that lasted three consecutive trading days.
   The dollar closed at 124.63 yen, down 0.24 yen from its finish
of 124.87 yen on Monday. It had opened the day at 124.78 yen and
ranged narrowly throughout the day between 124.55 and 124.79 yen.
   ``Trading was lusterless without any market incentives,'' said
an official of a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The market probably will remain quiet until the announcement in
Washington May 17 of U.S. trade figures for March, the official
said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a big 223.47-point loser Monday, won back 147.95
points, or 0.53 percent, finishing the day at 27,412.25.
   The main stock market barometer had lost a total of 405.42
points during the last three trading days.
   Bargain-hunting in a relatively small number of issues helped
the market overcome a general lack of buying interest ahead of a
refunding auction of U.S. Treasury bonds scheduled to begin in the
United States later today, traders said.
   Popular issues included oils, steels, machineries and heavy
electricals. Among the losers were drugs and glass makers.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares,
up from 600 million shares Monday. Advancing issues outpaced
decliners 495 to 401, while 176 isues were unchanged.

Primaries</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Politcal Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican voters decide two hard-fought primary battles today,
as Nebraska Rep. Hal Daub seeks to deny Sen. David Karnes a shot at
election and millionaire John Raese tries to derail West Virginia
Gov. Arch Moore's bid for a record fourth term.
   Also in West Virginia, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd faces
a little-known opponent as he seeks the Democratic nomination for a
sixth term.
   Nebraska's GOP Senate primary has become a bitter and divisive
contest _ as well as a close one. An Omaha World-Herald poll last
week showed Karnes backed by 41 percent of those interviewed, while
Daub was supported by 40 percent. Nineteen percent were undecided,
and the margin of error was 4 points.
   Daub, a 47-year-old four-term congressman, has accused Karnes of
being a ``rubber stamp'' for Gov. Kay Orr and President Reagan, and
of ``flip-flopping'' on votes, including the trade bill and last
year's highway bill.
   Karnes, 39, was a key supporter of Mrs. Orr's 1986 election
campaign but otherwise a political unknown when she appointed him
in March 1987 to fill the seat left vacant by the death of
Democratic Sen. Edward Zorinsky.
   The last U.S. senator defeated in a primary was Florida Democrat
Richard Stone, who lost in a runoff Oct. 7, 1980, to Bill Gunter.
Gunter was defeated that November by Republican Paula Hawkins.
   In Nebraska's Democratic primary, the overwhelming favorite is
Bob Kerrey, the popular 44-year-old former governor. He faces Ken
Michaelis, a 45-year-old disbarred lawyer.
   In West Virginia, Moore must overcome a well-financed campaign
by Raese as well as a last-minute televised report linking him to
corruption in Mingo County.
   The NBC report broadcast Sunday quoted former county political
boss Johnie Owens as saying that in 1972 Moore offered him $12,000
to include his name on a list of recommended candidates when Moore
was running for his second term as governor. A Moore spokesman
called the report ``a piece of garbage,'' and Raese said he was
``saddened by the whole event.''
   Raese, 38, maintains the state is in perilous financial shape,
and claims Moore made just 10 percent of $385 million in budget
cuts recommended by the Governor's Task Force on Waste Management.
   Moore, 65, has taken credit for cutting taxes by $311 million
during the past four years, although he fought most of the cuts
when they were imposed by the Legislature.He also says he has
brought new businesses and 30,000 jobs to the state, although the
total number of working West Virginians has increased by just 5,700
since 1985.
   Raese, who inherited much of his wealth, has a reputation as a
``rich kid'' who loves fast boats and hard living. He lost to
another millionaire, Jay Rockefeller, in his first try for office
in the 1984 Senate race.
   The last governor to lose a primary was Edwin W. Edwards, a
Louisiana Democrat, who finished second in a non-partisan ``open
primary'' last October to fellow Democrat Charles E. ``Buddy''
Roemer III. Instead of forcing a runoff, Edwards withdrew from the
race.
   In 1986, Gov. William J. Sheffield of Alaska lost the Democratic
primary to Stephen C. Cowper, who won the election in November.
   Seven Democrats are seeking their party's nomination for West
Virginia governor, but the race has been dominated by a bitter war
of negative TV ads between former House of Delegates Speaker Clyde
See and Charleston insurance executive Gaston Caperton.
   See has criticized Caperton's refusal to sign a voluntary
campaign spending limit and pointed out that a study found a 25
percent error rate in state claims processed by Caperton's
insurance company. The company handles the state employee insurance
system.
   Caperton has responded by saying he built the nation's 18th
largest insurance company and accused See of engaging in
``old-style politics'' and a dirty campaign full of ``distortion.''
   Byrd, 71, is opposed in the Democratic primary by Huntington
moving company owner Bob Myers. Byrd says he will give up the
majority leader's job to become Senate Appropriations Committee
chairman if he is re-elected and Democrats retain control of the
Senate.
   In the GOP Senate primary, state Sen. Jay Wolfe is expected to
defeat Bernie Lumbert of Buckhannon, a welfare recipient.

<HEAD>Danes Vote In Election Focusing On NATO Commitment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Danes voted today in a parliamentary
election seen as a referendum on Denmark's commitment to NATO.
   Polls opened at 9 a.m. for the 3.9 million eligible voters and
close 11 hours later. Reliable projections of the results were
expected at 10 p.m.
   Three independent surveys predicted little change from the
results of the previous election last September, with modest gains
possible for a rightist fringe group.
   It was the first election since World War II to be contested
over foreign policy or security issues. The Danes have voted 19
times in 43 years, a European record.
   Conservative Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, heading a
center-right coalition, called for the vote after he failed to
block a motion in parliament last month toughening Denmark's
anti-nuclear stance.
   ``This election is a referendum on NATO,'' Schlueter said in a
newspaper interview on Monday. The snap election comes just eight
months after Schlueter suffered setbacks in a previous ballot.
   If implemented, the resolution would require notification be
sent to visiting warships of Denmark's 31-year-old peacetime ban on
nuclear weapons in its territory. Until now Denmark has been
satisfied with a general policy statement.
   The resolution was seen as a challenge to NATO's policy of
keeping a nuclear option. U.S. and British ships, as a matter of
policy, refuse to say whether they are nuclear armed.
   Britain has said a Danish policy shift could affect NATO's
capability for emergency reinforcement of this strategic country
which controls access to the Baltic Sea.
   The Social Democrats, who sponsored the resolution, deny they
are anti-NATO, but say Denmark cannot be intimidated by NATO's
nuclear powers into compromising on its anti-nuclear policy.
   Twelve parties are in the race for the 179-member Folketing, but
a party must surpass a 2 percent threshhold to win a seat in the
legislature. Nine parties are in the current house.
   Schlueter's four-party coalition controls 70 seats. The
opposition alliance of Social Democrats and the Socialist People's
Party has 81 seats.
   The balance of power is held by the Social-Liberal Party, with
11 seats, which backs the government's domestic policy and supports
the opposition's foreign policy.
   Pre-election polls forecast another stalemate, with only the
far-right Progress Party showing gains from the nine seats it now
holds. The party advocates deep tax cuts, less bureaucracy and
restricting immigration, and it is shunned by all the mainstream
politicians.
   Also in the outgoing parliament are the four-seat leftist fringe
party, Common Course, and four representatives from the autonomous
territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
   Schlueter said he expected a long period of post-election
haggling to form a workable coaltion, and that he hoped for a broad
alliance that would command a majority in parliament. He did not
rule out a partnership with the Social Democrats, Denmark's largest
party.

   Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with
Jim Bakker led to the TV preacher's downfall, says she answered
grand jury questions about her former Long Island pastor.
   ``It seems like this will never end,'' Ms. Hahn told reporters
after testifying before the Suffolk County grand jury for about an
hour Monday. ``I will never regret, however, growing up in the
church.''
   Russell McGurt, a spokesman for state Attorney General Robert
Abrams, said the investigation ``is related to the earlier grand
jury proceedings in Albany.''
   Those proceedings reportedly centered on Ms. Hahn's former boss,
the Rev. Gene Profeta of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Massapequa,
and whether his church violated state tax laws.
   Ms. Hahn said the questions she was asked ``were very
predictable with a few surprises.'' She said because she was sworn
to secrecy she could not elaborate.
   Ms. Hahn declined to confirm if Profeta was the target of the
investigation but acknowledged that she was asked about him.
``Naturally, I would be. I worked with the man almost all my
life,'' she said.
   In October, Ms. Hahn said in a statement following her testimony
before the Albany grand jury that she ``turned to Reverend Profeta
for comfort and support'' after her sexual encounter with Bakker in
1980.
   She later became secretary to the church headed by Profeta, her
pastor since she was 14. Profeta's church turned out to be ``a
world just as disturbed as that of Bakker ... and the PTL,''
according to her statement.
   Bakker left the financially troubled television ministry in
March 1987 after disclosures of the sexual encounter her.
   Earlier Monday, Ms. Hahn told reporters that her life has been
threatened repeatedly and that ``very important papers'' were
stolen from her Long Island apartment during the past year.
   ``A lot of important things are missing,'' she said. ``The
entire story from the PTL on.''
   Her attorney, Dominic Barbara, said Ms. Hahn lost ``documents,
agreements, canceled checks, contracts.'' Neither he nor Ms. Hahn
elaborated about the theft.
   Ms. Hahn, who appeared topless in Playboy magazine last year and
sold the magazine her account of the 1980 encounter with Bakker,
has been living in Playboy founder Hugh Hefner's Southern
California mansion.
   ``I see myself as someone who has always been in the wrong place
at the wrong time,'' Ms. Hahn said, getting into a limousine with
her lawyer.

   Despite misgivings among officials about
honoring a Nazi airship, a historical marker now designates the
spot where the Hindenburg exploded and crashed 51 years ago,
killing 36 people.
   ``There was some political hesitancy,'' Ocean County Freeholder
George Buckwald said after Monday's dedication. ``But we felt it
was time to forget the politics and view it as an historic
occasion.''
   Several hundred people gathered for a ceremony last year marking
the 50th anniversary of the crash. The freeholders _ county
supervisors _ paid for a marker at the site, a field at what is now
the Naval Air Engineering Center.
   The plaque was to be dedicated Friday, the 51st anniversary of
the May 6, 1937, tragedy. But the service was postponed by rain
until Monday, the 52nd anniversary of the Hindenburg's first flight
into the United States.
   The bronze marker, set in pink granite, is surrounded by a
concrete walkway in an elliptical shape similar to the Hindenburg's
outline. Several dozen people attended the dedication ceremony.
   ``It's a Navy tradition that when we make a ship a memorial, we
put a plaque on the bridge,'' said Capt. James R. Macdonald,
commanding officer at the engineering center. ``In this spot is
where the bridge, or the control car, on the Hindenburg came to
rest.
   ``They should have done this a long time ago,'' said John
Iannaccone, who was in the Hindenburg's ground crew on the fateful
day. ``Everybody who comes here wants to know where it happened.
Now they can see where it happened.''
   Iannaccone and several others at the dedication brought small
pieces of the 804-foot Hindenburg's charred aluminum alloy frame.
   The Hindenburg was filled with highly flammable hydrogen instead
of fire-proof helium, a rare commodity that the U.S. government
would not willingly share with Germany.
   Investigations indicated the probable cause of the explosion was
a hydrogen leak in the aft part of the ship, complicated by
thunderstorms and static discharge from the landing lines dragging
on the ground below.
   Nick Grand, a spokesman for the Naval Air Engineering Center,
said final details have not been worked out on allowing the public
onto the secured base to see the memorial.

<HEAD>Contras Meet In Attempt To Iron Out Divisions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ten representatives of the
Nicaraguan rebels met along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border to try
to iron out divisions within their organization, a rebel spokesman
said.
   The meeting involved unidentified civilian and military members
of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the principal rebel umbrella
organization, who were ``interested in bringing about the cohesion
of our forces,'' said Boscos Matamoros, a Resistance spokesman.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Matamoros
said none of the Resistance directors participated in the meeting.
   Matamoros also denied published reports that a group of Contras,
as the U.S.-backed rebels are known, have been holed up in a
Honduran base camp since Saturday and were refusing to take orders
from the Resistance leadership.
   A report in today's editions of The Washington Post said that
between 1,500 and 3,000 rebels were mounting a rebellion at a base
camp in Yamales, a tiny Honduran village about three miles from the
Nicaraguan border.
   According to the Post, the reported rebellion was being led by
Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, a Contra military commander.
   ``There is no rebellion. Everything that says there is (one) is
false,'' Matamoros said. ``There are only differences in criteria,
as occurs in any democratic movement.''
   In San Jose, Costa Rica, a Contra official closely tied to the
Resistance directorate also denied there had been an uprising.
   ``We cannot deny that there have been problems in our ranks, but
it is my understanding that the situation is under control and that
all combatants are willing to obey the established authorities,''
the source told the AP, speaking on condition that he not be
identified.
   He confirmed there were about 3,000 rebel guerrillas in Yamales.
   Matamoros declined to comment on the results of Sunday's
meeting, which he said lasted over two hours. He did say that
Hernandez Membreno was at the session.
   ``We are acting in a democratic manner in which there always are
differences of opinion,'' Matamoros said. ``Nevertheless, the
situation will be resolved very soon.''
   Matamoros said none of those at the meeting was opposed to the
March 23 cease-fire plan signed by Contra leaders and
representatives of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista goverment.
   The Contra official in San Jose, however, said there is
``discontent among a group of our combatants who do not agree with
the accords ... and this has created the crisis that exists at the
moment.''
   Seven high-level Contras were expelled from Honduras on Friday
after demanding the firing of their chief, Col. Enrique Bermudez,
who reportedly opposes the peace agreement.
   They accused Bermudez of corruption and of surrounding himself
with supporters of the late Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza
Debayle, who was ousted when a popular revolution brought the
Sandinistas to power in 1979.
   The Contra source confirmed Hernandez Membreno was among those
seeking Bermudez's ouster.
   He said the infighting over Bermudez's role had seriously
divided the Resistance directorate as well, with ``one axis formed
by Aristides Sanchez and Alfredo Cesar who support Bermudez, and
another axis formed by Adolfo Calero, Azucena Ferrey and Pedro
Chamorro'' who want to replace the colonel.
   The source said that Bermudez and the directorate members were
summoned to Washington last week, where Secretary of State George
P. Shultz urged them to settle their differences.
   As a result of that meeting, the source said, the directorate
members ``are seriously talking to resolve their differences over
the military and political leadership of our forces.''

<TEXT>
   An escaped killer who eluded
authorities for five weeks, living in the rugged hills in a lean-to
and eating groundhog, was captured when his sprint to flee
searchers was slowed by a dog he'd befriended.
   Tommie Mollohan, 45, who was serving a life term for the 1973
robbery and murder of a grocer, was caught Monday following a
two-hour chase that one officer likened to a deer chase.
   Mollohan was the last to be recaptured of three murderers who
escaped April 3 from the West Virginia Penitentiary. He was trapped
on a remote, heavily wooded ridge about 25 miles from the prison,
state police said.
   Police said Mollohan relied on his outdoors savvy to remain free
five weeks, but he also befriended a dog, and the pet slowed him
down during Monday's chase.
   ``He had the dog tied up'' on a makeshift leash of string and
led it along while running, but Mollohan finally released the
beagle when it had trouble keeping up, said Trooper S.P. Singleton.
   ``The dog followed him and was with him when we caught him,''
Singleton said.
   Local police, state conservation officers and authorities with
tracking dogs chased Mollohan up one thickly wooded ridge and down
another.
   The escapee carried a dismantled .22 caliber rifle in a garbage
bag but ditched it during the pursuit, Singleton said.
   ``Finally we got him coralled in there and he jumped up in front
of a local police officer,'' Singleton said. ``He gave himself up.
I think mostly he was tired.
   ``We almost would have lost him again if he had headed up
another ridge,'' Singleton said. ``He said he knew that, but lost
his bearings.''
   Mollohan had been seen in the area before but had evaded
searchers.
   A resident reported seeing Mollohan Sunday night, and about six
troopers searched the woods until 1:30 a.m. before going home.
   ``Then we got another call this morning and were looking in the
woods for only five to 10 minutes when he bolted up the hill. The
chase was on,'' Singleton said.
   Mollohan weighed about 230 pounds when he escaped from prison
but lost between 45 and 65 pounds while free, Singleton said.
   He had to eat groundhog and lived in a lean-to, police said.
   Aside from being tired after the strenuous chase, however,
Mollohan appeared to be in good shape, the trooper said.
   ``He's got some scratches, but that's it. You wouldn't think
there was anything wrong with him the way he ran up that hill this
morning,'' Singleton said. ``A regular guy couldn't have done it.''
   Mollohan faces administrative escape charges, but Singleton said
criminal escape charges likely would be dropped. ``He's already
serving life. What more could we do?''
   Penitentiary officials described Mollohan as the mastermind of
the April escape by the three murderers, all of whom were serving
life sentences without chance of parole.
   Bobby Dean Stacy, 35, was arrested April 14 in Columbus, Ohio,
at the apartment of a friend, where he was hiding in a closet.
Stacy had been convicted of killing a Huntington police officer.
   David Williams, 28, was caught late last month in Mercer County,
where he was riding in a pickup truck with his brother. Williams
was convicted of murder and other charges in the December 1980
slaying of a Marytown resident.

<HEAD>Judge Restricts Lady Bing's Contact With Her Husband</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Rudolf Bing's wife must stay away from her
husband for six hours a day to let him rest and to allow nurses to
care for him, a judge has ordered.
   The judge's temporary order Monday specified that male nurses be
hired because of Lady Carroll Douglass Bing's apparent jealousy of
female nurses.
   ``I'm not convinced that you are such a danger that you have to
be restricted altogether,'' state Supreme Court Justice Carmen
Ciparick told Lady Bing during one of her rare calm moments during
the hearing.
   The lawyer for the 86-year-old former Metropolitan Opera
director, who has been ruled incompetent to manage his own affairs,
is trying to bar Lady Bing from their apartment. The hearing will
continue next Monday.
   Bing's lawyer, Paul Goldhamer, charges that Lady Bing, who has a
history of mental problems, has abused her husband verbally and
physically.
   He asked the judge to annul the Bings' marriage, claiming his
client suffers from Alzheimer's disease and didn't know what he was
doing when he married her last year.
   Mrs. Ciparick's order requires the 48-year-old Lady Bing to stay
away from her husband from 10 a.m. until noon for his nutrition and
hygiene needs, from 3:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. so he can nap, and
from 9 p.m. until 10 p.m.
   After 10 p.m., she may stay with Bing until 10 a.m. the next
day, the judge ruled, and if Bing must see a doctor, his wife may
not accompany him.
   Lady Bing frequently disrupted the hearing, which started
Thursday.
   On Monday, nurse Irene Gault testified that when she tried to
keep an eye on Bing one day Lady Bing screamed at her, ``Go away!
We don't need you!''
   Lady Bing then ``bundled him onto a bus,'' the nurse said. ``I
tried to go on the bus and Carroll started to swing her leg, as if
to kick me. Carroll pushed me off the bus with both hands on my
chest.''
   Lady Bing shouted, ``That isn't true! I never swung my leg.''
   Ms. Gault said that March 7 ``was the third time I was hit by
Carroll, in the hallway of their apartment. I had gone in with a
detective to get his (Bing's) blood pressure.''
   She said Carroll tried to block their entry, but Bing let them
in. Ms. Gault said that when she put a blood pressure cuff on Bing,
``Carroll struck me very forcefully on the arm and said, `Don't you
put the make on my husband.'''

   The city of Kanpur was blacked out for
several hours today after a monkey was electrocuted on the same
high tension wire where her mate was killed 10 days ago, the United
News of India reported.
   It said the female monkey had visited the site daily until
jumping on the power line. Her mate died April 30 when he jumped on
the same line, UNI said.
   Both episodes caused blackouts of several hours in Kanpus, 240
miles southeast of New Delhi.

<HEAD>Water Tanks Donated to Cancer Society Stretch Hundreds Of Yards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARDON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In her zeal to raise money to fight cancer,
Donna J. Lang saw a unique opportunity in the donation of 63,000
flawed water softener tanks.
   The Geauga County chapter of the American Cancer Society is
charging $1 to $2 for the tan, blue and white tanks, which stretch
hundreds of yards on a tract that one day will be turned into a
golf course.
   ``I'll probably be in a nursing home by the time we sell them
all,'' Ms. Lang, the chapter's executive director, said Monday.
``But I'm the kind of person who likes to try anything once.''
   Ms. Lang said the society has made more than $1,200 so far
selling the tanks, which people in the county east of Cleveland
have been buying to use as drainage pipes, buoys, lawn rollers,
boats and even dog houses.
   The cylindrical tanks, which have a hole in one end for pipe,
range from 6-by-13 inches to 30-by-40 inches, she said.
   Burlington Development Co. here offered the tanks to the society
about two months ago, said Chuck Steckley, the company's
construction supervisor.
   Burlington acquired the tanks when it purchased 2,400 acres it
plans to develop as housing and golf courses, Steckley said. The
stockpile had been owned by late architect Carroll Bassler, who got
them from a Chardon firm called Structural Fibers, Steckley said.
   ``They were all seconds, so Structural Fibers couldn't use
them,'' Steckley said. ``Bassler lined them all up. He was selling
them for culvert pipe mostly and sold many, many thousands. But
unfortunately, he didn't live long enough to sell all of them.''
   The Cancer Society may keep the tanks on Burlington's land until
it sells them, Steckley said.
   ``We have been putting ads in the paper and putting up fliers
and so forth,'' she said. ``There are just so many of them! It's
almost like they're cloning themselves up there!''

   Central China's Hubei province has been hit by
its worst drought in a century, destroying more than 32 million
acres of farmland and drying up much of its water supply, an
official report said today.
   Only 1.24 inches of rain has fallen in the province since April,
just 0.08 inches more than the same period in 1887, the overseas
edition of the People's Daily said.
   About 1.3 million people and 470,000 heads of livestock are
directly affected by the drought, which has dried up many of
Hubei's reservoirs and smaller rivers.
   Temperatures in the province have hovered around 100 degrees,
the paper said.
   Officials said farmers have been unable to plant one-third of
Hubei's spring rice crop because of the water shortage.
   The water level of the Yangtze River, the source of
hydroelectric power in Hubei, has dropped below that of last year,
the paper said, but did not say by how much.
   Severe drought also has afflicted northwest China, in some areas
lasting more than 20 months, but heavy rains fell in the northern
and western provinces last Friday and Saturday, earlier reports
said.
   China has been plagued by unusual weather this spring.
Hailstorms struck central and coastal provinces last week, killing
at least 21 people, injuring 370 and destroying homes and crops.
   A tornado in southern China's Guangdong province May 1 killed
five people and injured 40.

<TEXT>
   Centenarians say the secrets to
their longevity are not drinking, not smoking and not consorting
with those who do.
   ``Live a good, clean, honest life,'' Elizabeth Lamont, 100, of
Unionville recommended Monday as she and 13 other centenarians or
near-centenarians from the Hartford area were honored by state
officials Monday at a senior citizens' center here.
   She said she refused to marry a man because he would not promise
never to drink beer.
   ``Have faith in God,'' said Catherine Osenkowski of Terryville,
who is six months shy of her 100th birthday. ``Eat plain and
wholesome food. No smoking or intoxicating liquor. Work hard.''
   However, one man thought too much work wasn't advisable.
   ``Work, but not too much,'' said Frank Grabowski, 106, of New
Britain.
   ``Just keep a-going,'' said Alice Welcher Erikson, 103, of
Hartford.
   What the centenarians share is an appreciation for all things
modern, from electricity and automobiles to telephones and washing
machines.
   Asked what inventions helped them the most, Elizabeth Goebel,
99, of Enfield, said: ``The electric iron and washing machine. I
scrubbed clothes on a washboard and had a flat iron that was heated
on a stove.''
   ``Electricity, telephone, television,'' added Sister Maria
Aloysius Murphy, 100, of West Hartford. ``New modes of travel,
including planes and boats.''
   Monday's event was the fourth of eight Centenarians' Days
scheduled throughout Connecticut this month in honor of Older
Americans Month, according to Lena L. Ferguson of the state
Department on Aging.
   There are about 500 centenarians in Connecticut.

   Peggy Tishman, a leader in Jewish philanthropic

the Union Theological Seminary in its 152-year history.
   Mrs. Tishman, president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation
of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, was elected by the trustees
Monday with four others who will take office at the board's next
meeting, scheduled for September.
   The Rev. Dr. Donald W. Shriver Jr., president of the
Presbyterian school, said the student body and faculty is growing
increasingly diverse.
   He noted that the seminary has a close relationship with the
Jewish Theological Seminary, where Mrs. Tishman is also on the
board. Both institutions built their campuses early in this century
close to Columbia University.
   The other new members are Rosamund Arthur, a community
volunteer; Dr. Ross Hamilton, attending physician at St. Luke's
hospital with a practice in Harlem; Edward Miller, journalism
consultant, and LuAnn Polk, a Union alumna on the staff of Harvard
University Health Service.

<TEXT>
   A leading Chinese economist today said China has
reached a crossroads that can lead either to the prosperity of
greater reform or the dangers of a return to Soviet-style state
planning.
   Li Yining, dean of the Economic Management Department at Beijing
University, said he feared backsliding in China's 10-year-old
program of market-oriented reforms as the nation tries to cope with
rising inflation and serious supply-demand imbalances.
   ``The danger now is not price rises or the education system,''
he said at a Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing news
conference. ``The danger is that the need to stabilize the economic
situation will be used to bring back the traditional system.''
   Li, an outspoken proponent of stock ownership of state-run
enterprises, said the traditional system was the Soviet-style
command economy which China followed until senior leader Deng
Xiaoping started introducing market principles in 1978.
   Li said there is general commitment to reform at the state
level, but enterprises at the local level ``only know the old ways,
and find it hard to change.''
   The government, he said, ``needs to improve its propaganda work.
We must tell ordinary people that in the past they had stable
prices under conditions of poverty.''
   A surge in retail prices in the past year has dampened
enthusiasm among some government leaders for pushing ahead with
reforms, and has given rise to theme of maintaining economic
stability.
   In the first quarter of this year the government said retail
prices rose 11 percent compared to the same period in 1987, while
food prices were up 17.9 percent.
   Asked about the policies of Premier Li Peng, who is regarded as
favoring greater stability and a slower pace of reform, Li said he
agreed with the premier's statement that increasing supply is the
best way to correct supply-demand imbalances.
   To do this, the economist said, ``We must readjust the structure
of enterprises, stimulate the activities of labor and promote the
flow of productive factors.''
   Li said, however, that China cannot rush into reforms of its
state-controlled pricing system, which has led to shortages of
goods and failed to meet rising consumer demand.
   Complete decontrol of prices would fuel inflation and lead to a
run on bank deposits because price rises would outstrip bank
interest rates. Price reforms should be carried out over a
six-to-eight year period, he said.
   Li said he supported recent moves by the government to end price
controls on pork, vegetables and other non-staple food items and
replace them with direct subsidies to urban consumers.
   China, which kept prices virtually unchanged during the first 30
years of Communist rule, ``shouldn't be afraid of small price
rises,'' Li said.
   Li, who spent six years in labor reform camps during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution for questioning Soviet-style state planning,
said prosperity in China depends on changing systems of ownership,
letting the value of most goods be determined by the market and
making entrepreneurs and family farmers the backbone of the economy.
   Socialism, he said, must be based on a commodity, or market,
economy. ``As long as the economy prospers and living standards are
raised, our purpose is fulfilled. People will see that socialism is
not connected with poverty but wealth.''
   Li envisioned three types of stock markets for enterprises: one
where shares could be traded only among public enterprises, one
where employees would hold and trade shares and one open to anyone.
   Asked about the need for democratic reforms to accompany changes
in the economy, Li said: ``Socialist democracy, like socialist
realism, can't develop overnight. As long as we are moving in the
right direction it is fine.''
   In China, he said, ``Many things are irrational. But we can't
just get rid of them.''

<BYLINE>Soviet Abuse of Psychiatry Continues Despite Some Reform,
Psychiatrist Says
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World opinion has produced reforms in the Soviet
Union's use of psychiatric hospitalization for political
repression, but the policy seems to be continuing despite glasnost,
a dissident Soviet psychiatrist says.
   Although many dissidents have been released from psychiatric
hospitals, a substantial number remain, said Anatoly Koryagin.
   And a well-publicized new set of official guidelines on
hospitalizing psychiatric patients makes no substantial difference,
he said.
   It allows ``a very broad opportunity for any citizen to be
forcibly taken for an examination'' at the request of police,
employers, co-workers or neighbors, he said.
   Koryagin, who was allowed to leave the Soviet Union after
spending six years in prison for publicizing psychiatric abuses,
lives in Switzerland. He spoke to reporters Monday through an
interpreter at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association.
   A recent conversation with a Soviet contact found 20 to 25
well-documented cases of unjust confinement in psychiatric
hospitals, but that is only ``a minute portion of the total
number,'' he said.
   Various groups that monitor the problem estimate that 500 people
are in Soviet psychiatric hospitals because of political or
religious activities, or for organizing labor unions or speaking
out against conditions in the workplace, said Ellen Mercer,
director of international affairs for the American psychiatric
organization.
   As a result of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost or openness, the Soviet press has begun to write about the
unjust hospitalizations. But Koryagin said the coverage tries to
make them sound like bureaucratic oversights or medical
incompetence rather than an official policy.
   He also said dissidents who have been released from psychiatric
hospitals still carry a diagnosis of mental illness and must
register at local mental health centers.
   Although Soviet authorities say millions of names will be
removed from local registers, that only means the people will not
be regarded as needing psychiatric help any longer, he said.
   No official recognition will be given to the fact that the
diagnosis was erroneous and politically motivated in the cases of
dissidents, and as a result they will not be rehabilitated legally
and socially, he said.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fortified
their positions or brought in reinforcements today, taking
advantage of a lull in fighting that came after Syria warned the
four-day carnage must stop.
   Police said no casualties were reported overnight from the
confrontations in the slums of south Beirut.
   The fighting, which had simmered down to sporadic gunfire by
this morning, has killed 154 people and wounded 367 since it broke
out Friday. The casualty toll included 65 people killed and 50
wounded on Monday.
   Police said 36 Syrian officers moved into the area with six
committees in an effort to implement a truce in fighting between
the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   The battle for control of Beirut's southern slums, where an
estimated 250,000 Shiites live, raised fears about the fate of 18
foreign hostages. They include nine Americans and most are believed
held by Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers in the 16-square-mile
Shiite enclave.
   The committees _ each of which has a Syrian officer, an Iranian
Embassy official, a representative of Amal and another of Hezbollah
_ set up truce observation posts in the slums before dawn, a police
spokesman said.
   The committees ``are trying to convince the warring factions to
observe a cease-fire as a first step,'' said the spokesman, who
cannot be identified in line with standing regulations.
   A three-point proposal announced Monday calls for a truce,
withdrawal of gunmen from streets and return of the warring
factions to positions they controlled before the fighting began, he
said.
   Hezbollah, which has gained control of half of south Beirut in
the clashes, ``rejects the return to pre-Friday positions,'' he
said.
   Hezbollah gunmen, the spokesman said, were using the relative
lull to barricade their positions with high earth mounds in the
densely populated districts of Ghobeiri, Bir el-Abed, Hay Madi and
Mesharafiyeh.
   Amal, which controls all gateways to the disputed south Beirut,
was bringing in reinforcements, he said.
   Amal militiamen, according to the spokesman, controlled the
districts of Haret Hreik, Mreiji, Roweiss, Shiyah and Kasskass.
``It appears that both sides are preparing for another round of
fighting,'' he said.
   Many of the estimated 250,000 residents of south Beirut also
appeared convinced that another round of fighting is yet to come.
   The spokesman said scores of civilians carrying clothes and
other personal belongings left the embattled areas overnight to
safer places in Syrian-policed west Beirut. He said about 60
percent of south Beirut's residents already have evacuated the
disputed area.
   Ahmed Kurdi, an Associated Press photo technician, was trapped
with his wife and six children Friday in a shelter in Bir el-Abed,
but escaped Monday.
   ``Shells rained nonstop around us,'' he said. ``Kids screamed
and there was no way to comfort them or feed them.'' When fighting
abated for a short time, Kurdi said, ``I told my wife `This is our
chance to get out.' We did, dodging sniper fire as we ran out of
Bir el-Abed.''
   The thunder of shellfire rolled over the city all day and into
the night. Gunmen atop racing ambulances fired into the air to
clear traffic so the wounded could reach hospitals. Radio stations
appealed for blood donations.
   Doctors confirmed allegations by both sides that wounded
fighters were dragged from ambulances and hospitals and slaughtered
by their rivals.
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon, including 7,500 in Moslem
west Beirut. It is the main power broker after 13 years of civil
war but is being challenged by Iran, which the Syrians support in
its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Fighting eased as the committees drove into the slums, but
sporadic bursts of cannon and machine-gun fire echoed in the region
well into the night.
   Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites are its largest sect. With Syria's
blessing, Amal crushed Hezbollah last month in predominantly Shiite
south Lebanon. The four-day battle cost 62 lives and 150 people
were wounded.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms struck the South today after sweeping
through Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee with large hail, rain and
high winds that overturned airplanes and tore down power lines and
trees.
   The thunderstorms were developing ahead of a cold front Monday
night and today moved into Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama
and Texas
   A severe storm in Middlesboro, Ky., caused extensive damage to
mobile homes, buildings, power lines and trees.
   Thunderstorms moving across northern Ohio whipped winds to 70
mph in Cleveland, overturning six planes at the Lakefront Airport
on Monday afternoon.
   Parts of eastern Texas were battered by baseball-sized hail. In
other parts of Texas, golf-ball-sized hail pummeled areas in Otto,
Moody, Frankston, Bullard and Smith counties. Large hail at
Freestone damaged automobiles.
   In Alabama, Adamsville and southeastern Sylacauga were pelted by
hail the size of golf balls, while strong thunderstorm winds downed
trees and power lines at Pratt City.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect this morning for
portions of northern and central Mississippi and portions of
northern and central Alabama.
   But the thunderstorms that produced severe weather in the Ohio
Valley had weakened this morning, with just scattered showers and
thunderstorms from Virginia to New York.
   Dry weather prevailed over the rest of the nation, with clear
skies from the Southwest to the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
central and eastern parts of the Great Lakes through the upper Ohio
Valley, the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states into New
England; showers and thunderstorms over Florida; and sunny skies
over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures should be in the 60s or 70s across much of the
nation; in the upper 50s over the northern Great Lakes region; in
the 80s from the central valleys of California through the southern
Rockies, southern Plains, lower Mississippi Valley and southeastern
states to the mid-Atlantic coast; in the 90s and near 100 across
the desert Southwest and from the Rio Grande Valley into
south-central Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees at Bangor, Maine, to 78 degrees at Brownsville, Del Rio and
Laredo, Texas.

<HEAD>Hungary's Communist Party Leaders Tackle Crucial Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Hungary's increasingly
divided communist party met today to discuss reforms that critics
say do not go far enough to solve the nation's serious economic
problems.
   The Central Committee meeting is a prelude to a national party
conference on May 20, where the future of party leader Janos Kadar
may be debated.
   Kadar, who is almost 76, has led the party since Moscow crushed
an anti-Soviet revolution in 1956. While he pioneered reforms that
made Hungary relatively prosperous in the late 1960s and 1970s,
Kadar now is increasingly blamed for the country's economic crisis.
   Premier Karoly Grosz, a leading contender to succeed Kadar, has
fueled speculation about Kadar's future by saying that ``the laws
of biology also apply to politicians,'' an apparent reference to
Kadar's age.
   Grosz visited Britain last week and told reporters that today's
Central Committee meeting will elect a committee to make proposals
on party personnel changes. Those proposals are to be reviewed at
another Central Committee meeting after the two-day party
conference.
   ``In the event that some 1,000 delegates attending the
conference decide that personnel changes are necessary, and if
these changes include the person of Janos Kadar, he will accept the
decision,'' Grosz was quoted as saying on the state news agency MTI
on Friday.
   Kadar has said he would step aside if asked. But he has given no
signal that he intends to relinquish control of the Hungarian
Socialist Workers' Party any time soon. Last month, four of the
most outspoken reformist Communists were abruptly expelled from the
party, a sign that Kadar and the party's old guard still have clout.
   Articles in the state-run media and a fierce debate over how
much political pluralism to allow in Hungary testify to the
increasing turmoil in party ranks.
   A draft policy paper for the May 20 conference proposes some
political reforms, including secret ballots, multi-candidate party
elections and limited terms of office for party officials.
   But critics say the proposals, while allowing for a wider choice
in party elections, make no provision for genuine pluralism and
emphasize the need for Communists to stick rigidly to party policy
when making public statements.
   The latter requirement is seen by some observers as an attack on
Imre Pozsgay, an outspoken Central Committee member and leading
proponent of change.
   He has called for changes in the constitution that would provide
for referendums, guarantee the independence of interest groups and
review the party's role in Hungary's changing society.
   ``There is a need to rethink the whole structure of socialism,''
Pozsgay said in a recent interview in the Magyar Nemzet daily.
   Pozsgay, who heads the communist-sponsored Patriotic People's
Front _ an umbrella organization for the party, unions and social
groups _ has said there will be no real change in Hungary without
political reforms that ``renewed public consensus.''
   The reformers' arguments that political change is essential to
long-term economic progress have been bolstered in recent months by
continued economic crisis. With a gross foreign debt of more than
$17 billion, this nation of 10.6 million people has eastern
Europe's highest per capita debt.
   Inflation is running at more than 15 percent, and official
economists say unemployment may reach 200,000 by 1990 if austerity
measures imposed by Grosz force unprofitable state firms to close.

   The U.S. dollar fell against most other major
currencies in sluggish European trading early today. Gold prices
rose.
   The dollar fluctuated within a narrow range in the first hours
of trading in the absence of any market-moving news.
   A trader in Tokyo said foreign exchange markets were likely to
remain quiet until the announcement in Washington May 17 of U.S.
trade figures for March.
   Midmorning dollar rates compared with late Monday:
   --1.6793 West German marks, down from 1.6820
   --1.3977 Swiss francs, down from 1.4010
   --5.6933 French francs, down from 5.7075

   --1,248.50 Italian lire, down from 1,250.00
   --1.2375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2396
   The British pound rose to $1.8828 from $1.8790.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.63 Japanese yen, down from
Monday's close of 124.87 yen. In later London trading today, the
dollar slipped to 124.52 yen.
   London's main bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $447.10 a troy ounce, up from $444.00 late Monday. A
trader described the market as quiet and trendless.
   Gold was bid at $447 in Zurich, up from $445.
   Earlier, the gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $448.95, up
from $446.66.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid of $6.46 a troy ounce,
up from $6.43.

<HEAD>Official: U.S. Ambassador's Actions Constituted Hijacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian official said a decision
by the U.S. ambassador to have his chartered Panamanian plane fly
to an American air base, reportedly because of security concerns,
constituted a hijacking.
   Maj. Pascual Gonzalez, director of the Panamanian Civil
Aeronautics Board, also told a news conference Monday that a
relative of Panama's ousted civilian president was aboard the plane.
   The U.S. Embassy said U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis made the
decision after he saw Panamanian security men arguing with his own
security detail on the tarmac at the small civilian Paitilla
airport on Sunday.
   ``It was a judgment call,'' an embassy statement said. ``The
ambassador's security detail made the judgment that the (situation
at Paitilla) was not a good environment.''
   The plane remained Sunday night at Howard Air Base in the former
Panama Canal Zone, about five miles from Panama City.
   Gonzalez told reporters that the plane failed to follow
necessary ``procedures'' for a civilian aircraft to land at a
military base and spend the night there.
   Gonzalez said U.S. officials refused to provide any information
about the plane after it landed at the air base. The plane's owner,
Hugo Giraud, told the news conference the embassy had not informed
him his plane was at Howard.
   ``As far as we are concerned, until we conclude the
investigation, the plane was hijacked or stolen,'' Gonzalez
declared.
   He said that Gabriel Lewis Galindo Jr., son-in-law of former
President Eric Arturo Delvalle, and the son of an opposition leader
were also on the plane.
   Delvalle has been in hiding in Panama since his dismissal Feb.
26, a day after he tried to fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Noriega, commander of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and the
power behind the civilian government, was indicted in the United
States on drug trafficking charges.
   The Reagan administration continues to recognize Delvalle as
Panama's legitimate president and has demanded that Noriega resign.
   The incident Sunday was the second apparent attempt by
Panamanian security to interfere with the ambassador's movements.
On April 3, a military vehicle tried to stop Davis' limousine as he
left the Vatican ambassador's residence.
   In another development, hundreds of people waited in line at
banks on Monday to cash checks and make other withdrawals for the
first time in nine weeks, although there were limits on how much
they could take out.
   No withdrawals had been allowed since March 3, at some banks
longer, because of runs on deposits and a severe cash shortage
prompted in part by U.S. economic sanctions against Panama. Those
sanctions have frozen $50 million in Panamanian government funds at
U.S. banks.
   Monday's step came only after bankers reluctantly agreed to a
government plan to reopen with restrictions on withdrawals. New
rules issued by the government's National Banking Commission limit
withdrawals from checking accounts to 25 percent of the balance on
March 3, up to a maximum of $10,000.
   Some customers said they were able to cash checks as large as
$1,600, while others came away empty-handed because the available
balance from the account that issued the check already had been
withdrawn.
   The U.S. Embassy said the Panamanian agents at Paitilla airport
were armed with M-16 rifles and shotguns and demanded passports and
other documents. It said ``their manner was considered hostile.''
   An embassy official said the aircraft remained at Howard because
``a new flight plan must be filed'' before it could be flown out.
Davis and his party were returning Sunday from a day at the
Contadora resort island.

   A jury began deliberations in the trial of
reputed mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and eight
co-defendants accused of conspiracy and murder in the 1984 murder
of a rival.
   The jury spent two hours in deliberations Monday before
returning to their hotel. Deliberations were to resume today.
   Police allege that Scarfo, 59, ran the area's Mafia from his
home in Atlantic City, N.J., before his arrest in an unrelated
extortion case in 1986.
   He and the other eight defendants were being tried for the Sept.
14, 1984, murder of Salvatore Testa. Testa's body, with two bullets
in the head, was found trussed and wrapped in a blanket in a wooded
area of southern New Jersey.
   The jury got the case Monday after closing arguments from Scarfo
attorney Robert Simone, who attacked two former gangsters who were
key prosecution witnesses and Assistant District Attorney Barbara
Christie.
   Ms. Christie conceded that the informants, Nicholas ``Nicky
Crow'' Caramandi and Thomas DelGiorno, were despicable men who
talked only after they had been marked for death.
   ``Rats? Yes. But when you enter a sewer don't rats lead the
way?'' Ms. Christie said. ``In mob-related killings the
commonwealth (of Pennsyvlania) doesn't have the luxury of witnesses
like Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King.
   ``DelGiorno and Caramandi weren't members of the Knights of
Columbus but of a secret, vicious underworld mob, an organization
where killing was part of the power. (They) told you that Nicky
Scarfo was the boss and that Scarfo's organization eliminated
problems and dissension by simple execution,'' she said.
   The informants testified that Scarfo gave the order to kill
Testa because Testa was threatening Scarfo's control of the mob and
because Testa broke his engagement to the daughter of one of
Scarfo's top lieutenants.
   Attorney Oscar Goodman, who represents Scarfo nephew Philip
Leonetti, identified during the trial as the mob's underboss, said
the defense was confident of acquittal.
   ``We feel very, very good about it,'' Goodman said.
   Ms. Christie and Simone were more cautious.
   ``I never think about it until they (the jury) tell me,'' she
said.
   Simone said, ``I never feel confident when the case is in the
jury's hands, but I'm hopeful.''
   The trial began more than two months ago.
   Caramandi and DelGiorno testified Testa was murdered in a closed
south Philadelphia candy store. Caramandi said Testa was lured by
his best friend, Joseph Pungitore of Philadelphia, to the store,
where Salvatore ``Wayne'' Grande of Philadelphia pumped two bullets
into Testa's head.
   The two witnesses said Testa's body was transported in a van to
New Jersey, where it was dumped along a road.
   Besides Scarfo, Leonetti of Margate, N.J., Grande and Pungitore
the other defendants are Salvatore Merlino of Ventnor, N.J.; and
Philadelphians Francis Iannarella, Salvatore Scafidi, Joseph Grande
and Charles Iannece.
   Scarfo also faces charges in two other murders.
   Last year, he was convicted of conspiring with a former city
councilman to extort $1 million from a waterfront developer. He is
serving a 14-year prison sentence on that conviction.

   The prosecution of a renegade polygamist
clan shifts to state homicide charges following the federal
convictions of four family members on 20 counts stemming from a
church bombing and 13-day police standoff.
   The jury, deliberating 25 hours over four days, returned guilty
verdicts Monday against clan matriarch Vickie Singer; her
son-in-law, ringleader Addam Swapp; Swapp's brother, Jonathan
Swapp; and her son, John Timothy Singer.
   Assistant Attorney General Creighton Horton said his office
intends to file state murder charges next week in the death of
state corrections Lt. Fred House in the Jan. 28 assault by law
officers that ended the standoff.
   ``And we do it all over again,'' Horton said.
   The Swapp brothers and the wheelchair-bound John Timothy Singer
were found guilty of second-degree attempted murder of FBI agents
for the shootout that ended the 13-day siege at the clan's Marion
farm.
   The panel acquitted Mrs. Singer of one count of attempted murder
of FBI agents, an accompanying firearms charge and one count of
possession of a sawed-off shotgun.
   U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins set sentencing for July 1.
   Based on federal guidelines, U.S. Attorney Brent Ward estimated
that Addam Swapp will serve 15 to 20 years in prison, and the other
three defendants face 10 to 12 years, most likely in separate
federal institutions.
   In addition to the attempted murder conviction, Swapp, 27, was
found guilty of maliciously damaging the church building, forcibly
assaulting and resisting federal agents, and possession of an
unregistered bomb.
   He also was found guilty of a corollary charge of use of a bomb
on the malicious damage count and two counts of use of a firearm
linked to the assault and attempted murder charges.
   Mrs. Singer, 45, was found guilty of the same charges, with the
exception of the attempted murder charge and the corollary firearms
charge.
   Jonathan Swapp and John Timothy Singer, both 21, were found
guilty of assault-resistance and attempted murder charges and the
two accompanying firearms counts.
   Authorities have identified John Timothy Singer as the
triggerman in House's death, but Horton would not say how many
people would be charged.
   When they entered Jenkins' courtroom for Monday's proceedings,
all four defendants smiled and waved to family members.
   ``We've already won the victory!'' Addam Swapp shouted to
reporters as he was led into the federal courthouse.
   Charlotte Swapp, one of Mrs. Singer's two daughters married to
Addam Swapp, said of the verdict, ``I'm not disappointed in it
because I expected it.''
   Attorneys for Addam Swapp said they planned appeals, mainly on
the attempted murder conviction. Lawyers for Mrs. Singer and
Jonathan Swapp, who became engaged to a 20-year-old admirer during
the trial and plans to be married in jail, also were considering
appeals.
   The maximum penalty for attempting to kill federal agents is 20
years, 10 years for bombing the chapel. The firearms and
use-of-a-bomb charges carry minimum mandatory five-year penalties.
Assaulting federal agents and possession of a bomb each carry
maximum 10-year terms.
   The prosecution called 67 witnesses ranging from elite FBI
hostage rescue teams to Mormon bishops and ballistics experts.
   Defense attorneys called only three witnesses, including Addam
Swapp, who admitted bombing the Kamas Stake Center but insisted he
never tried to kill law enforcement officers.
   U.S. Attorney Brent Ward denounced the clan as ``a band of
outlaws'' who committed crimes in the name of religion. ``Trust in
the Lord but pass me my M-1 rifle,'' he said of Addam Swapp.
   Clan members invoked the name of their slain patriarch,
polygamist John Singer, throughout the siege and trial, claiming he
was murdered in 1979 in a church- and state-backed conspiracy.
   Singer, husband of Mrs. Singer and father-in-law of Addam Swapp,
was shot to death after he drew a gun on officers who had come to
arrest him for refusing to send his children to public schools and
return his second wife's children to their father.

Anti-Bias Pact</HEAD>

   A federal judge slapped U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng with a contempt of court citation for not
abiding by an anti-sex discrimination agreement stemming from a
15-year-old lawsuit
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti on Monday also ordered the U.S.
Forest Service to stop discriminating against women in California.
   Conti took the action as a result of the lawsuit originally
filed by Equal Rights Advocates, a California public-interest law
firm, on behalf of Gene Bernardi, a female Forest Service
sociologist in Berkeley.
   Bernardi, who eventually left the Forest Service, said she was
denied advancement because she was a woman.
   The case was expanded in 1977 to cover all of the service's
approximately 1,800 women employees throughout the state.
   A 1981 consent decree called for the Forest Service to end
discrimination and upgrade female employees over a five-year period.
   Equal Rights Advocates returned to court last summer, saying the
decree had not been followed.
   Federal Magistrate Claudia Wilken agreed, saying that less than
half of 162 provisions in the agreement had been complied with. She
recommended a three-year extension of the decree and establishment
of a $1.5 million fund to implement it and a $360,000 fund to
monitor it.
   Conti's rulings, which incorporated Wilken's recommendations,
make official an agreement reached in March in which the government
agreed to halt job bias against women in the Forest Service.
   Lawyers for Lyng, who has been agriculture secretary for two
years, have said the agreement will not be contested.
   ``It's a very clear message in terms of putting the Department
of Agriculture on notice and the Department of Justice on notice,''
said Gail Kaufman, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates.
   Kaufman contended that the Agriculture Department had tried in
the past 18 months to stop sex bias and to adopt various employment
goals and timetables, but the Justice Department ``basically pulled
the rug out from under them'' because of its own anti-affirmative
action stance.

   An anti-apartheid newspaper
made fun of a government official after it was ordered to cease
publication under the country's emergency censorship regulations.
   An order in the official government gazette Monday said South, a
Cape Town-based newspaper with a multiracial readership, will be
banned until June 10.
   South normally publishes Thursday, but in anticipation of the
ban it published a special edition Monday that included a
front-page likeness of Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha in
battle armor, wielding an axe.
   The censorship regulations empower Botha to close publications
he considers subversive for renewable three-month periods. His
actions cannot be challenged in court.
   ``At the root of the problem is apartheid and exploitation,''
said an editorial in South's special edition. ``We did not create
the situation. We are only reporting it. And it is this ugly truth
that the government can't stomach.''
   South serves a readership of about 15,000, primarily in the Cape
Town area. It was founded in March 1987 with funds from European
church groups.
   Its editor, Rashid Seria, said at a news conference last month
that South had lost about $15,000 since it began publishing.
   In March, Botha imposed a three-month ban on New Nation, a
militant, black-oriented weekly with a national circulation of more
than 50,000. Five other publications have been warned that they
face possible closure.
   The paper believed to be next in line for possible banning is
The Weekly Mail, with a predominantly white readership and strong
support among liberal politicians, journalists and business
executives. The newspaper's editors are trying to mobilize a
campaign to save it and other threatened publications.
   The current state-of-emergency expires June 11. South could be
banned for an additional two months if, as expected, the emergency
is extended for another year.
   Seria, speaking to reporters after the ban was issued, said
21,500 copies of the special edition were printed. He said it was
possible the government might demand that the issues be recalled.
   South's board of trustees, which includes the the Rev. Allan
Boesak, issued a statement saying it was ``sheer madness'' for the
government to ban newspapers rather than address South Africa's
political problems.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in South
Africa. The 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and
the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   West German banks have agreed to grant
the Soviet Union a $2.08 billion line of credit to help modernize
its consumer-goods industry, a banking spokesman says.
   Harald Schmitz, spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said Deutsche Bank
is the lead financial institution in a consortium that will provide
the line of credit.
   ``There will be discussions (with other West German banks) over
this in the next few days,'' Schmitz said Monday.
   ``The credit will be for financing the modernization of the
Soviet Union's consumer-goods and food-processing industries.''
   He said the package was arranged by Yuri Moscovsky, chairman of
the Soviet Foreign Trade Bank, and Deutsche Bank co-chairman F.
Wilhelm Christians.
   It followed three days of talks in Duesseldorf between Soviet
officials and West German industrialists and bankers last week.
   Schmitz declined to elaborate on details of the agreement,
saying ``we're just at the start of this.''
   Deutsche Bank is West Germany's largest commercial bank.

<HEAD>Curator: DeSillers `Imprudently' Spent Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maria DeSillers ``imprudently'' spent at least
$200,000 in donations for her late son's care on herself and
friends, including more than $30,000 for jewelry, clothing and a
luxury car, says a court-appointed curator.
   In documents filed Monday in Dade County Circuit Court, Karen
Gievers gave the most detailed account yet of how money for Ms.
DeSillers' son, Ronnie, was spent.
   Ms. DeSillers spent $44,359 to help other children needing
transplants, according to bank records.
   ``The rest (of the money) appears to have been spent
imprudently, for inappropriate reasons ... without proper
authorization,'' wrote Ms. Gievers, an attorney appointed to
oversee Ronnie's estate.
   Her son, Ronnie, 7, died at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in
April 1987 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant. His plight
captured the nation's attention and donations poured in from across
the country, including $1,000 from President Reagan.
   Ms. DeSillers was scheduled to appear in Dade County Circuit
Court today to contest charges by the Florida secretary of state in
a related case that she violated state charity laws by using
donations to pay for personal expenses.
   Ms. DeSillers has repeatedly denied the allegations. She said
she used much of the cash withdrawals to promote organ-donor
awareness and gave money away to ``people with problems.''
   According to the documents, Ms. DeSillers made cash withdrawals
of $96,526 and gave $23,700 to her ex-boyfriend for business losses
and $7,284 to her ex-husband for car payments and expenses for his
daughter from a previous marriage.
   Records also show that Ms. DeSillers withdrew $6,134 from the
account for her brother and $750 for her ex-boyfriend's mother.
   ``While Ms. DeSillers has clearly suffered from the great
personal tragedy of her son's death, she appears to have ignored
the laws ... when it suited her purposes to do so,'' Ms. Gievers
wrote in her preliminary report on the estate's assets.
   Almost $300,000 of the $527,000 that remained in Ronnie's
account when he died has been spent, according to court documents.
About $243,500 remains in the estate.
   Ms. Gievers is asking the court to return any remaining money to
creditors and give the rest to other children who need transplants.
A hearing is expected next month.
   Her attorney, Harry Robbins, said Ms. DeSillers frequently paid
back friends and family members who had given her financial
assistance when Ronnie was ill.
   In November, the Pittsburgh hospital sued Ms. DeSillers after
she refused to pay the a $262,000 balance from her son's
operations. Ms. DeSillers has charged that Ronnie received poor
care, but hospital officials have denied it.
   The documents filed Monday show that Ms. DeSillers bought
$10,850 in jewelry and $5,797 in clothing. She used $3,163 from
donations for furniture, $13,500 for a 1985 BMW, and $1,700 for
rent at her Miami bayfront apartment, according to records.

   Rescue workers had to cut a hole in
the bedroom wall of a house to extract a 1,000-pound man who had to
be hospitalized for acute bronchitis, officials said today.
   John Finnerty, 45, was taken to Brunswick Hospital with the aid
of a highway department truck equipped with a hydraulic lift, said
Officer Salvatore Yovino, a spokesman for Suffolk County police.
   Yovino said police responded to a call of a man having
difficulty breathing at 10 p.m. Monday. Rescue workers decided he
would have to be hospitalized.
   Finnerty would not fit through the bedroom doorway, so workers
cut a hole in an outside wall and up to a dozen men lifted him out
of the house on a gurney, Yovino said.
   He was then put on the truck, using the lift, and taken to
Brunswick Hospital, where he was in stable condition today, the
officer said.
   Yovino said that Finnerty lived at the house with his wife and
at least one child. He said he was unsure whether Finnerty was able
to move around but a neighbor told police he had not seen Finnerty
for a couple years.
   Another man who tipped the scales at more than 1,000 pounds,
Walter Hudson, was discovered in Nassau County on Long Island last
year when police were called to free him after he got stuck in a
doorway.

Army said today.
   All the dead and four of the injured were South Korean. The
driver, also hurt, was a soldier from the 2nd U.S. Infantry

   The vehicle also damaged six stores and hit three other vehicles
in the accident Monday in Tokori, 25 miles north of Seoul, the Army
said.
   The Yonhap News Agency said the vehicle's brakes failed.
   The injured South Koreans were listed in stable condition at a
hospital near Tokori, the Army said. The driver was being treated
for shock at the 121st U.S. Army Evacuation Hospital in Seoul.
   Military officials said Maj. Gen. Jack B. Farris, commander of
the U.S. division, ordered an investigation.
   The United States maintains about 40,000 troops in South Korea.

   A maintenance engineer apparently bypassed a
safety system during last week's skyscraper blaze and died when he
stopped an elevator manually at a fire-engulfed floor so hot that
the elevator door partly melted, a city official said.
   The city's chief elevator inspector, Harvey Ledesma, said Monday
that the elevators in the 62-story First Interstate Bank building
did not malfunction during the Wednesday blaze that gutted the
building's 12th through 16th floors.
   However, he said one person died and others suffered close calls
when they bypassed the elevators' fire safety system, allowing them
to stop on or near fire-engulfed floors. Forty people were hurt in
the blaze in the state's tallest building.
   ``They (the elevators) all did what they're supposed to do,''
Ledesma said.
   Meanwhile, fire officials said the cause of the blaze remains
undetermined, but added that arson had largely been ruled out. They
said, however, that the fire destroyed many clues to the cause.
   Earlier, Battalion Chief Gary Bowie downplayed speculation that
the bank's planned sale of its securities unit played a role in the
blaze that injured 40 people. ``No one interviewed has said that
there's a possibility of an incendiary fire of any type,'' he said.
   Bowie and bank officials said the fire apparently started on the
12th floor near a computer center where recent electrical work was
performed.
   Ledesma, who inspected the building's 33 elevators Monday, said
the elevators serving the fire floors were activated by heat
sensors, which sent them to the main floor.
   But he said the only person killed, maintenance engineer John
Handy, and other maintenance workers in the building bypassed this
safety system.
   Handy, 24, boarded elevator No. 33 and, using a special fire
key, went to the 12th floor, where he died almost immediately.
   Ledesma said Handy, after reaching the 12th floor, had to push
an ``open'' button that allowed the door to remain open until a
``close'' button is pushed.
   Ledesma said he found the fire's intense heat had partially
melted the door of the elevator in which Handy died.
   ``The fire key was melted into the `on' position,'' he said.
   He said other building maintenance workers using elevators in
attempts to escape the flames must have activated independent
service switches inside locked panels that overrode fire safety
systems and allowed the workers to travel to floors 12 through 16.
   However, one worker, Radmila Radich, said the elevator safety
system did not work properly.
   Ms. Radich, 40, said that after the fire started she called for
an elevator while working on the 19th floor simply by pressing a
button and that the elevator promptly arrived.
   Then, she said, she and another maintenance worker pushed the
13th-floor button, where they exited into choking smoke. They were
able to crawl to safety in a stairwell.

   More than 700 people, at least half of
them women and children, were evacuated from the Golden Temple
complex today, a day after security forces laid siege to the shrine
after an exchange of gunfire that claimed five lives.
   Sikh extremists fired intermittently today at security posts
around the shrine.
   More than 2,500 paramilitary troops and police armed with
automatic rifles and light machine guns have encircled the
sprawling temple complex. The siege follows an exchange of fire
between militants in the temple and paramilitary troops on Monday
in which at least five people were killed and 10 injured.
   Police said most of the people who left the complex today were
devotees who became trapped inside on Monday.
   Police searched and interrogated the men who left the temple.
   ``At least 30 or 40 of them will turn out to be terrorists
trying to slip away,'' said Police Inspector J.S. Bhatia.
   A curfew imposed on the old, walled sector of the city remained
in force for a second day, police said.
   Sikhs began firing on security positions on the perimeter of the
400-year-old shrine Monday. The gunfire subsided overnight, but
resumed sporadically this morning, police said.
   Seven Indian reporters and photographers who had been in the
shrine told The Associated Press that at least 100 Sikh militants
armed with Chinese-made AK-47 and American M-16 automatic rifles
were firing from eight to 10 bunkers within the temple complex.
   The reporters and photographers, who spent much of Monday
trapped in the temple as the firefight raged, emerged overnight.
   They said heavily fortified positions could be seen on western,
eastern and northern walls of the complex, which is centered by the
golden-domed temple that is Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
more autonomy or an independent homeland for Sikhs in Punjab,
contending their minority sect is discriminated against by India's
majority Hindus. Sikhs are about 2 percent of India's population of
780 million, while Hindus are 80 percent.
   The confrontation began Monday afternoon on the shrine's western
perimeter.
   Commanders of Punjab state police and federally controlled
paramilitary forces had gone to a security post on a nearby rooftop
to view what was suspected to be the start of construction of a
concrete bunker outside the temple's western wall.
   Police said militants inside the shine opened fire on the
commanders. S.S. Virk, a Sikh who is deputy inspector general of
the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, and four of his
companions were injured, police said. A bullet was removed from
Virk's chin.
   The police opened fire on the Sikh gunmen in the temple, and
heavy exchanges for more than three hours subsequently died down to
intermittent firing.
   Five people were killed, including two civilians and three
militants, police said.
   It was the worst in a series of clashes that began shortly after
militant Sikh priest Jasbir Singh Rode was released from federal
custody and made the temple's chief priest in March.
   Rode had been in custody for more than two years under the
government's anti-terrorism rules. He was released in an effort by
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to placate extremist Sikhs and lure
them into negotiations.
   Since Rode's return, there have been persistent reports that the
militants were building bunkers and firing ports in the temple
complex.
   On April 29, extremists fired on a police post near the shrine
after security forces attempted to arrest a Sikh militant. The
militant escaped under the cover fire and fled into the temple
complex.
   The army stormed the Golden Temple complex in June 1984 to drive
out militants, and some 1,200 people were killed. Less than four
months later, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two
of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge.
   Sikhism was founded 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to
warring Islam and Hinduism. A later leader turned it into a warring
religion in which all males must carry knives.

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary Defends Administration's Seizure Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary James Burnley today
defended the seizure of a $2.5 million yacht for carrying less than
a teaspoon of marijuana and said the Reagan administration will
continue to enforce its toughened seizure policy.
   ``We didn't decide that we were going to go out and seize big
expensive yachts over tiny bits of marijuana,'' Burnley said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``What I announced a few weeks ago was if we find any illegal
drugs on a vessel, we're going to seize a vessel, we're going to
turn it over to Customs and we're going to let them make the final
determination about whether the vessel should be returned to the
owner or sold at auction.''
   The 133-foot Ark Royal was confiscated in international waters
off Key West, Fla., on Saturday after a Coast Guard boarding party
found about 10 marijuana seeds and two stems in a trash can and
dresser drawer, the crew and the Coast Guard said.
   Custody of the ship, which is owned by Tomima Corp., was turned
over to Customs Service agents in Key West; the yacht's six-member
crew was put ashore but not charged Sunday night. The vessel could
be auctioned as forfeited property after several hearings,
authorities said.
   The government's toughened policy provides for seizure of any
vessel when any amount of illegal drugs is found. Previously, boats
were seized only when large amounts of drugs were found, and the
vessels were held in lieu of a fine based on the weight of the
drugs.
   ``We've got a massive national problem,'' Burnley said. ``We've
got people out there whether they own big boats or little boats,
big cars or little cars; we've got people of all economic classes
who are buying this stuff and we got to get at the demand side of
this problem or we're not ever going to be able to get it under
control.''
   Burnley, interviewed from Boston, said the owner of the ship
``will be permitted to make whatever case he wishes to about why
there were drugs found on it and Customs will make the final
determination about whether the boat is returned to the owner or
sold at auction.''
   ``Nobody will lose a boat without a hearing,'' Burnley added
later.
   But James Powell, national legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the policy is violates the Constitution.
   ``What's wrong with it is the same thing that's wrong with
shooting someone or hanging someone and then saying, we're going to
give you a trial to see if your guilty,'' Powell said.
   ``In our society, we have always held that a person is innocent
until proven guilty and the burden is on the government to prove
someone of guilt before taking such drastic actions,'' he said.
   Powell, interviewed with Burnley, said the Constitutional
provision ``that prohibits the government from taking property
without due process and that's what's happening in this case.''

   One of 11 people released unharmed after
being kidnapped and held by leftists said his captors lectured him
on nationalizing foreign oil companies.
   Helmut Luecker, the West German honorary consul in Medellin, was
kidnapped with 10 other people by leftist rebels from May 3-5. Also
released Monday were three Swiss, a Frenchman, a Mexican and five
Colombians.
   Everyone freed Monday was unharmed, according to a police source
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The rebels released two other Colombians on Friday. Another West
German and three Colombians still were being held.
   Luecker told the Colombia radio network RCN that he was
kidnapped in Medellin on May 3 by men posing as construction
workers.
   ``They showed me their guns and said right from the first that
it was a political kidnapping and that I had no reason to fear for
my life,'' he said.
   He said his captors lectured him during his week in captivity,
saying foreign oil operations should be nationalized. He said they
treated him well and also talked of right-wing death squads blamed
for killing about 800 people in the past two years.
   Guerrillas of the National Liberation Army, which claimed the
kidnappings, are led by a former priest, Manuel Perez of Spain.

   Authorities have begun an investigation into

   Authorities said Monday there could be a reasonable explanation
for DiGilio's departure. They also speculated it could be the
result of organized crime strife or punishment for his
outspokenness.
   Some officials also saw it as a possible ploy in connection with
his approaching sentencing.
   ``I hope he's gone fishing, but I wouldn't bet my paycheck on
it,'' state police Superintendant Col. Clinton L. Pagano said.
   The head of the FBI's Newark office, John C. McGinley, said
investigators had not settled on a theory and were tapping their
street sources and law enforcement agencies for information.
   DiGilio's wife, Ellen, filed a missing persons report Saturday,
saying she had had no contact with the former boxer from Bayonne
since Thursday evening.
   DiGilio's lawyer, Larry Bronson, said his client missed a Friday
meeting to discuss efforts to overturn his recent loan sharking
conviction in Morristown. Sentencing is set for next week.
   Bronson said DiGilio, who law enforcement officials say is a
powerful soldier in the Genovese organized crime family, was upbeat
about his victory last month in a federal waterfront racketeering
trial and was confident about overturning the state conviction.
   ``He's not traveling,'' Bronson said. ``He would have told
somebody if he was traveling.''
   A DiGilio associate, George Weingartner, said he had no idea
where DiGilio was. ``We're all worried,'' he said. ``It's just very
strange. We've been swamped with calls.''
   Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney Melvin Kracov, who prosecuted
the federal case, said chances were ``50-50'' DiGilio met with foul
play.
   Pagano speculated that DiGilio's high-profile ways may have
angered his alleged mob superiors, including reputed Genovese boss
Vincent ``The Chin'' Gigante of Old Tappan.
   DiGilio spoke freely with reporters, acted as his own attorney
in the federal trial, engaged in a widely publicized courthouse
brawl with a co-defendant and has sued the federal government for
harassment.
   ``Experience tells us that when you act like he acted, you're
not long for this world,'' said Pagano, referring to others in mob
history eliminated for talkativeness.
   In contrast, Pagano said, Gigante strives to keep a low profile.
Authorities say DiGilio was rising the same way Gigante did _
through racketeering on the Hudson River waterfront.
   In the backdrop of DiGilio's disappearance is evidence of
growing tension between the Genovese and Gambino organized crime
families, he said.
   He said Gigante was aligned with former Gambino boss Paul
Castellano, whose killing, police sources have said, was ordered by
current reputed boss John Gotti of New York City.
   The New York Daily News, quoting Justice Department sources, has
reported that the FBI warned Gotti that Gigante had sanctioned a
contract on his life.
   Gigante has been known to wander the streets of Greenwich
Village in a bathrobe, and has avoided trial through claims of
mental incompetence. DiGilio has used erratic behavior to delay
trials, and Kracov suggested his disappearance may be a similar
game.
   One law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, doubted that was likely because he said DiGilio wouldn't
do anything to take himself off the streets, where he keeps close
tabs on his alleged illegal interests.

<HEAD>Cat Owner Leaves $5 Million To Animal Charity</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout to CORRECT that widow left entire estate
to society for animals. CORRECTS name of cat. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 80-year-old widow who lived with her cat willed
over $5 million to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, the charity said today.
   Dorothy Walker, who died in December, bequeathed her entire
estate to the charity in her will, published Monday.
   The donation is the biggest the charity has received since it
was founded in 1824, said charity spokeswoman Diana Jones.
   The widow, who reportedly had a few distant relatives but no
children, lived with her tomcat, Pussy, in the west London suburb
of Richmond.
   ``She often said she preferred animals to people and she was
determined to prove it to the very last,'' Mrs. Walker's former
housekeeper, Linda Havelal, 70, was quoted as saying in London's
Today newspaper.
   Mrs. Walker's lawyer, Mark Prest, reportedly said in London's
Daily Telegraph that the widow left no special instructions
concerning the cat's welfare.
   The housekeeper said she is looking after the cat until a
permanent home can be found.
   ``We will be trying to find a good home for her locally,'' Prest
was quoted as saying.
   He said that most of Mrs. Walker's money came from properties
she and her husband owned in the Richmond area, where they lived
since World War II.
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said
it received its second-biggest donation in 1985, when an English
woman living in Switzerland left the charity her estate, then worth
$2.2 million.

<TEXT>
   A millionaire real estate developer from Japan
has been detained by immigration officials after questions were
raised about his eligibility to enter the United States, officials
said.
   Katsuhiro Kawaguchi, 54, has been admitted to a Honolulu
hospital for kidney dialysis, but technically is in the custody of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Deputy District
Director Roy Hendricks said Monday.
   The immigration officer at the Honolulu International Airport
reviewing Kawaguchi's documents after his arrival Monday on a
flight from Japan was not satisfied that Kawaguchi was admissable,
Hendricks said.
   The case is being referred to an immigration judge.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Burke said a decision would be
made on whether Kawaguchi will be prosecuted for possible visa
fraud. He declined to give any details on the case.
   Kawaguchi was in the news in September when a former gangster
stormed into his house in Tokyo, shot to death a housemaid and
seriously wounded a police officer after a six-hour seige. The
intruder eventually shot and wounded himself.
   Kawaguchi is president of Hachidai Sangyo and last year bought a
major portion of Coconut Island in Kaneohe Bay here for $8.3
million, surprising state officials who had been considering buying
the island for the state.

<TEXT>
   Californians who fear a devastating
earthquake in the nation's second largest city based on the
purported prediction of 16th century seer Nostradamus are falling
prey to superstition and nonsense, state emergency officials say.
   The prediction ``is pure, unadulterated bunk,'' Bill Medigovich,
director of the California Office of Emergency Services, said
Monday by telephone from Sacramento.
   ``We don't want people to plan (for quakes) out of fear of
predictions like this,'' he said. ``We want them to do it on a
rational basis.''
   But hundreds of people called earthquake information hotlines,
some left the region and children expressed fear because of a vague
prediction by Nostradmus and a 1981 movie, now sold on videotape,
called ``The Man Who Could See Tomorrow.''
   The film, narrated by ``War of the Worlds'' prankster Orson
Welles, claimed the French seer said the area would be wrecked by a
huge quake this month. Some astrologers have said a big quake is
most likely this week.
   Students at California State University, San Bernardino,
satirized the paranoia Monday with an ``End of the World Party'' at
the student union pub, complete with ``free death cake'' and
disaster movies, said Cecilia McCarron of the school's student life
office.
   ``Predictions based on clairvoyance, headaches, animal behavior,
astrology and other bogus methods have no basis in science and
should be categorically disregarded,'' said a statement released
Monday by state Seismic Safety Commission executive director L.
Thomas Tobin.
   The Office of Emergency Services says a major, devastating quake
is more than 50 percent likely in Southern California in the next
25 years. But if one occurs this week or month, ``as far as the
Nostradamus prediction, it will be coincidental,'' said Jim Davis,
chairman of the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council.
   Nevertheless, hundreds who fear the prediction swamped phone
lines at Griffith Observatory, the American Red Cross and the
California Institute of Technology.
   ``Most of these people aren't kooks. They're genuinely
frightened, telling me they can't sleep, they're having nightmares
and they don't know what to do,'' said Caltech spokesman Robert
Finn.
   Psychologist Robert Butterworth said worried callers swamped the
hotline at Charter Hospital of Long Beach. He partially blamed
revelations in a book by former White House chief of staff Donald
Regan that First Lady Nancy Reagan consulted astrologers.
   Elaine Young, a Beverly Hills real estate broker, said she
leased a dozen homes for people who left town for the month, and
leased another 15 to wealthy New York residents who came to
California for the month because someone started a rumor a big
quake would hit the East Coast.
   Finn said he tells callers Nostradamus never predicted a quake,
only a hailstorm, and that the alleged prediction refers only to
``the New City,'' not Los Angeles.
   ``Even if you believe in Nostradamus, the prediction is totally
bogus,'' Finn said. ``The prediction came out of that 1981 movie
and they translated it very liberally. That movie also predicted
Teddy Kennedy would be elected president in 1984.''

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers banged on
doors and seized Palestinian identity papers today, the start of a
month-long campaign to force 400,000 Arabs in the Gaza Strip to
renew their government ID cards.
   Arab underground leaders issued a warning from a mosque
loudpeaker, ordering Gazans not to cooperate with the army. They
said the program was an attempt to abort the Palestinian uprising.
   Also today, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded a Palestinian
after their jeep was stoned in the West Bank village of Ramin, the
army command said. The unidentified youth was taken to Tulkarem
hospital where he was in serious condition, Israel radio reported.
   A soldier was slightly injured in the incident.
   In Gaza City, hundreds of people crowded into a school which has
been converted into a makeshift registration center. Many said the
army forced them to come.
   ``At dawn this morning, the troops entered people's homes. They
knocked at the door and asked for IDs and told us we had to change
them,'' said Sheik Khalo, a Moslem religious leader from Gaza City.
   One witness told an Arab reporter that soldiers confiscated one
portion of the Israeli-issued identity cards, without which the
card becomes invalid.
   Soldiers told residents of Rimal, a Gaza City neighborhood of
8,000 people that was the first area targeted by the program, to
bring two color photographs, fill out applications and pay $10 for
new cards.
   The orders affect Palestinians between the age of 18 and 60.
   Israeli authorities say the new cards are being issued because
many of the old ones are torn and worn.
   Palestinians say the measure is aimed at increasing military
control over the Arab population and breaking a tax boycott, one of
the chief tactics of the uprising. Military officials have said
residents will have to pay back taxes before being issued new ID
cards.
   Arabs in the occupied lands must carry an identity card at all
times and show the card at frequent security checks. Identity cards
are vital for all transactions with the military government.
   Many Arabs who showed up today were angry because there was only
one official to process their applications.
   ``It is Ramadan (a Moslem holy month.) We are fasting,'' said
Ahmed Abu Hassan, 26. ``We are not animals to spend all day here
waiting.''
   Israeli troops set up several roadblocks near the registration
center and patroled the area with jeeps.
   A group of Palestinian youths about 20 yards from the center set
tires afire, threw stones at passing cars and told adults not to
renew their cards. When army jeeps raced to the scene, the youths
ran off.
   ``The refusal to change the ID cards is the beginning of civil
disobedience,'' said one slogan painted on a Gaza wall.
   An 18-year-old Palestinian who identified himself only as
Mohammed said he would not change his card.
   ``On the new IDs they will write all the previous times I was in
prison,'' he said. ``If it's written on the ID that I was in prison
I will get special treatment. Every time I get stopped, they will
beat me.''
   In the West Bank, the army kept a curfew today on the Dheisheh
refugee camp, where on Monday troops opened fire to disperse
stone-throwing youths.
   Israeli newspapers reported that a 34-year-old father of seven
who died at Dheisheh was killed by a stray bullet while he was at
his home up the hill from the protest. The daily Hadashot
identified the victim as Ibrahim Hussein.
   His death brought to 185 the number of Arabs killed since the
uprising began Dec. 8. Two Israelis also have been slain.
   Curfews were in place today in the village of Irtas, where
troops wounded three Palestinians during a protest Monday, and the
Balata and Jabaliya refugee camps.
   Elsewhere in the occupied lands and Arab east Jerusalem, a
general strike called by underground leaders halted most commerce
for a second day. Israeli radio reported, however, that thousands
of Palestinian from the occupied territories went to their jobs in
Israel.
   The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the deportation order of
Arab-American activist Mubarak Awad until a hearing May 23, but
rejected a defense motion for his release from jail after Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Awad could endanger Israel's security.
   Awad, 44, was moved today to Ramle prison from the Jerusalem
lockup where he had been held since Thursday, a police spokesman
told The Associated Press.
   The government has accused Awad, an advocate of civil
disobedience against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, of inciting Palestinians to violence. It also says his
tourist visa expired.
   The defense argues that Awad cannot be deported because he was
born in Jerusalem. Awad also is an American citizen and has a home
in Wapakoneta, Ohio.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Resigning; Suggests Aide for Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett has
recommended to President Reagan that he appoint the department's
undersecretary to the top post when Bennett steps down in
mid-September.
   Bennett met privately with Reagan at the White House Monday and
then through the department issued a statement saying he will
resign his Cabinet post to return to private life.
   Bennett told his staff he had recommended that Linus Wright, the
undersecretary of education and a former superintendent of schools
in Dallas, succeed him.
   Wright said he has not discussed the job with administration
officials.
   Addressing the Intergovernmental Advisory Council on Education
in Washington on Monday, Wright, 61, urged a return to ``value''
education in public schools. For too long, he said, the teaching of
right and wrong was avoided because it was considered tantamount to
teaching religion.
   During his 3{-year tenure, Bennett has been the scourge of
school bureaucrats, teacher unions and slipshod standards.
   He made headlines with acerbic criticisms of the ``blob'' of
school bureaucracy, the ``greed'' of colleges raising tuitions
twice as fast as inflation, and the ``Jim Crow math and
back-of-the-bus science'' meted out to black children in ghetto
schools. He called Chicago's schools the nation's worst and said
the city's system was in an ``educational meltdown.''
   Bennett, 44, called for the U.S. military to wage war against
drug traffickers and quarreled with the surgeon general over what
to teach children about AIDS and condoms.
   The outgoing secretary refused to discuss his plans after he
leave office, but they are believed to include hitting the lecture
circuit and writing a book on the future of education.

   When Leigh Herring spotted a mother duck
and some ducklings hanging around the shoulder of an interstate
highway service drive, she tried to shoo them away.
   But two of the ducklings vanished while waddling along, and when
she checked more closely, Herring saw a sewer grate. Under the
grate there were 14 confused ducklings.
   Herring, a courier for a delivery company, said she tried to
lift the grate, but it was too heavy.
   Then, from around the corner, came a truck from Engine Co. No. 2
of the Warren Fire Department on its way to a training exercise.
   After a brief inspection, firefighters Dave Bucknavich, Joe
Plotzke, Jerry Tignanelly and Andy Weigand, began their rescue
mission.
   ``We got the grate off and Andy got down in there and started
handing them out,'' said Plotzke of Monday's incident.
   After about 20 minutes, mother and her brood waddled off,
Herring continued her deliveries and the firefighters went on to
their training.

<TEXT>
   A high school health teacher who wanted
to give his students a break from serious classwork showed his
students a videotape detailing gruesome deaths and animal slaughter.
   Dale Brown admits he realized that showing 45 minutes of ``Faces
of Death'' to his second-period class Monday was a mistake. Even
so, he showed the film to later classes because students talked him
into it.
   ``It was a bad choice,'' said Brown, who is also an assistant
football coach at Huntington High School.
   The 105-minute videotape shows ``autopsies, dismemberment,
physical cruelty, human combustion and electrocution,'' its package
says. Video stores also bill the movie as offering ``the most
bizarre, grisly death experiences.''
   Jeannie Adkins, the manager of a Huntington video store, said
``Faces of Death'' is ``probably one of the most popular things we
have in here.''
   Brown said he rented the video Friday and planned to show it
Monday as a break from regular classwork. Students were not
required to watch the film and were allowed to work on other
subjects while the tape was playing.
   Still, some of the 42 students who saw the video complained
about it.
   ``He probably shouldn't have shown it,'' said student Kelly
Chaffin, who called the movie ``pretty disgusting, pretty cruel.''
   Chaffin said the movie showed people hammering on a monkey's
head and eating its contents and showed the slaughter of sheep and
cows. Brown turned off the movie just as a woman's body was cut
open, she said.
   Her mother, Brenda Chaffin, said parents should have been
notified beforehand.
   Melissa Limle, another student, said she kept her back turned
and worked on homework, but ``the sound effects were even
disgusting.''
   Brown said some of his students suggested the movie, but added
that he did not view the videotape before showing it to his
second-period class.
   After the first showing, he said, he realized it had been a
mistake. He said he showed it to his third- and fifth-period
classes later though because he allowed the students to ``talk me
into it.''
   Assistant principal Myron Bailes said he would have to see the
video tape before determining whether it was unsuitable for high
school students.

   The Fermi II nuclear power plant, designed
to withstand tornadoes and earthquakes, was knocked out by a
raccoon.
   The animal climbed into electrical equipment at a switchyard
outside the plant south of Detroit on Saturday, causing a
short-circuit, knocking out some power and triggering a shutdown of
Detroit Edison Co.'s $5.1-billion plant.
   Company spokesman Dan Vecchioni said backup generators kept the
plant's safety systems intact. The plant was operating at 3 percent
of power when the incident occurred.
   ``It's not uncommon for animals to cause power outages,''
Vecchioni said. The raccoon died.
   The reactor was restarted shortly afterward, but was shut down
Sunday when an emergency cooling system malfunctioned. It was
restarted again Monday night, but it wasn't known it would return
to full power.

   A bomb exploded today in Citibank's main
branch office in downtown New Delhi, killing one man and injuring
at least 14 other people, police and bank officials said.
   ``We can confirm that a bomb exploded today ... at one of our
branches in New Delhi,'' said David Roberts, a vice president and
country corporate officer for Citibank in India.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the 12:15 p.m.
explosion, which caused extensive damage to the American bank's
third-floor office.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Maryann Whitten said the embassy issued
a warning after the blast. ``The American Embassy has advised its
employees and American businesses in New Delhi to take security
precautions,'' she said. She did not elaborate.
   Ms. Whitten said there were no reports of injuries to Americans.
   Thirteen people injured in the explosion were admitted to Ram
Manohar Hospital. Another person was taken to the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences. Three of those admitted to Ram
Manohar Hospital were in critical condition, Dr. Saroj Sharma said.
   The dead man was identified as Satish Chaudhary, an Indian who
lived in the town of Noida east of New Delhi, the United News of
India reported.
   The man's name was disclosed in Parliament by P. Chidambaram,
India's minister of state for home affairs, UNI said. The Home
Ministry is responsible for internal security matters.
   Chidambaram said all of the injured were Indian citizens.
   The bank is staffed almost entirely by Indians, although many
foreigners use its services.
   The office opened late last year on the third floor of a new,
12-story office tower. The building overlooks the capital's central
Connaught Circle shopping arcade.
   One man, who said he had been inside the bank at the time of the
blast, said it was crowded with people waiting in lines for
tellers. He said at least two of the injured were women. He
declined to give his name.
   Most of the damage was at the northern corner of the office,
where foreign exchange transactions were handled.
   Pieces of glass littered the sidewalk and the street in front of
building, owned by the government-run Life Insurance Corp. Of India.
   The major damage appeared to be confined to the Citibank offices.

   Lincoln residents, hide your polyester. USA
Today reporter Karen S. Peterson is coming to town.
   Peterson spent a few days in Lincoln recently to research a
story on Cliff's Notes that ran in USA Today a week ago.
   In a story on the publisher of the yellow-and-black booklets
that explain literary classics, Peterson described Lincoln as ``on
the edge of nowhere, a city still comfortable with fulsome
waistlines and polyester.''
   Now USA Today is sending her back at the invitation of KFOR
Radio and the Lancaster County Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   Scott Young, the KFOR morning show co-host who helped organize a
``Polyester Pile Up'' that netted several thousand pounds of
discarded clothing, expects to accentuate the positive during
Peterson's two-day stay.
   ``We told her we just wanted her to have a good time and see the
highlights of the city,'' said Young. ``We told her we'd make it a
very positive experience for her.''
   Peterson will get the red-carpet treatment.
   A pep band at the airport and a billboard at 11th and L streets
will welcome her Wednesday evening.

<HEAD>Member of Japanese Red Army Arrested for Korean Plane Hijack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today they have arrested a member of
the Japanese Red Army who allegedly hijacked an airliner to North
Korea in 1970, and are investigating whether he was planning
terrorist attacks on the Olympic Games in Seoul.
   Police identified Yasuhiro Shibata, 34, as one of nine Red Army
members who commandeered a Japan Air Lines Boeing 727 with 138
people aboard to North Korea on March 31, 1970. The hijackers freed
some passengers during a stop in South Korea and released the rest
after the plane landed in North Korea.
   The Red Army, formed in the late 1960s, has called for
``simultaneous world revolution'' and has in recent years operated
primarily with Arab leftists in the Middle East. The terrorist
group has never had more than 300 adherents, according to police.
   Police said Shibata was arrested near his Tokyo apartment Friday
and was identified through fingerprints. He is the first suspect in
the hijacking to be detained.
   The other hijackers reportedly are in North Korea.
   Police said Shibata obtained a false Japanese passport in July
1986 by using the family registry of a man with dual Japanese and
North Korean citizenship. They said they did not know when Shibata
last entered Japan.
   A National Police Agency official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said investigators were questioning Shibata about
possible terrorist attacks on the Olympics in South Korea.
   ``As part of Japanese police efforts to ensure the safety of the
Seoul Olympics, we are investigating to see whether Shibata came
back to Japan to plan attacks on the Games,'' the official said.
   Shibata's arrest follows a series of recent incidents reportedly
involving Red Army members.
   Suspected Red Army member Yu Kikumura, 35, was arrested April 13
at a rest area along a highway in New Jersey after police found
three homemade bombs in his car.
   Also in April, Italian police put another reported Red Army
member, Junzo Okudaira, on an international wanted list for his
alleged involvement in the car-bomb attack on a U.S. military club
in Naples in which five people were killed.
   Last November, Japanese police arrested alleged Red Army member
Osamu Maruoka near Tokyo City Air Terminal after he arrived on a
flight from Hong Kong with a false passport. He was wanted in
connection with an attack at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport on May 30,
1972, and the hijacking of a jetliner over India in 1977.
   In the Lod Airport massacre, three Japanese Red Army members who
had arrived on a French airliner sprayed machine gun fire and
hurled hand grenades into a crowded luggage claim area. Twenty-six
people were killed, including two of the three terrorists.
   The surviving attacker was detained by Israeli security officers
and freed in 1985 as part of an exchange of 1,100 Palestinian and
other prisoners for Israeli soldiers.

   Postmaster General Anthony Frank said today
that he hopes to restore full postal service by the end of summer.
   ``Our tentative goal is ... late summer,'' Frank said at a
breakfast with reporters.
   Window hours at most post offices have been reduced by a
half-day a week, and Sunday sorting operations and box collections
were cut earlier this year, following congressionally imposed
budget reductions for the agency.
   The service reductions save $9 million a month, Frank said, and
restoring them means that amount of money must be saved in some
other way, with improved efficiency and cutting other spending.
   Rate increases imposed on April 3 do not affect the service
changes, Frank said. The accounting system required by Congress
results in the increased income being counted as a reduction in the
national debt, not as extra money for the agency.

   Authorities halted commuter trains and
changed an airport landing pattern today after a gunman holed up in
an apartment building for several hours, wounding a police officer
and threatening to fire at planes and trains.
   ``He's taken many wild shots,'' said Sgt. Anthony Heying of the
county sheriff's police. The man walked out of the building at
about 8:50 a.m. after a 4{ hour seige, Heying said. He was
arrested, but no charges were immediately announced.
   Heying said county police and officers from Bensenville and
Elmhurst surrounded the building. He said officials treated the
incident as a hostage situation although there was no confirmation
of anyone held captive.
   Diane Bahr, 36, who lives on the third floor estimated that 100
shots were fired. ``I'm hearing five at a time, then 10, there's so
many,'' she said.
   The gunman threatened to use plastic explosives and shoot at
trains and airplanes, the sergeant said. Residents of the building
were told to stay indoors.
   Air traffic from O'Hare International Airport that normally
would travel over Bensenville was diverted, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Don Zochert.
   Commuter trains that run behind the apartment building were
halted, spokesman Chris Knapton said, causing problems for 9,000
people who use the route into Chicago. Some buses were dispatched
to carry commuters, Knapton said.
   Officer Robert Amundsen of the sheriff's police was hit in the
foot, but his injury was not serious.
   ``He's sitting here with his left foot in bandages,'' Heying
said. ``He'll be all right.''

   Ronald Reagan is hesitant about bothering the
people who work for him _ so much so that he once let smoke pour
from the fireplace in his office rather than call for help, Donald
Regan says.
   Reagan did not want to make any demands on anyone, the
president's former chief of staff says in ``For the Record,'' the
newest collection of out-of-school tales by a White House departee.
So the chief executive did nothing when a fire, caused by a clogged
chimney in his study in the West Wing, broke out.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``He stayed at his desk,'' Regan wrote, ``reading his documents
with smarting eyes, until the guards asked if he wouldn't like to
move to another room while they put out the fire and the place
aired out. He hadn't wanted to bother anybody.''
   In his book, Regan offers contradictory portrayals of Reagan _
on one hand picturing the president as disengaged and indecisive, a
leader who ``laid down no rules and articulated no mission,'' and
on the other hand drawing him as involved and interested.
   In contrast to his harsh depiction of first lady Nancy Reagan,
he describes Reagan as judicious, eager to hear both sides; a
formidable reader who carries thick folders of reading material
under his arm when he leaves the office for the family quarters
around 4 p.m. daily; incapable of uttering an unkind word about
others and in love with his job.
   So Regan's Reagan:
   _Is aware of what he doesn't know. ``He hesitates to ask
questions or confess to a lack of knowledge in the presence of
strangers,'' Regan wrote, ``and thanks to the way his staff
operated, nearly everyone was a stranger to this shy president
except the members of his innermost circle.''
   _``Would apologize for asking a basic _ sometimes even a
startling basic _ question about an arcane subject.''
   _Has a good working command of economics. ``His grasp of basic
economic theory as it had been taught in his time (Eureka College,
class of '32) was excellent and he had kept abreast of later
theory,'' Regan wrote. ``He had no trouble understanding the
leading ideas of the day, or in making reasonable judgments about
the effects produced by policies based on Keynesian theory, of
which he was deeply suspicious.''
   _``Is a formidable reader and a talented conversationalist with
a gift for listening,'' and a man who, at heart, ``is an
old-fashioned, small-town American who believes what he reads in
the papers.''
   _Gets in trouble because of his capacity to remember _ and
believe _ everything that is told to him. ``If someone told him (to
use a wholly fictitious example) that there had been 35,987 hairs
in Stalin's mustache, this fact would go into the presidential
memory bank, possibly to emerge weeks or months later in the middle
of a press conference,'' Regan wrote. ``It never seemed to occur to
him that anyone would give him incorrect information. His mind was
a trove of facts and anecdotes, something like the morgue of one of
his favorite magazines, Reader's Digest, and it was impossible to
guess when or why he might access any one of these millions of
bytes of data.''
   _Loves the routine of his job. Wrote Regan: ``He regarded his
daily schedule as being something like a shooting script in which
characters came and went, scenes were rehearsed and acted out, and
the plot was advanced one day at a time. ... If he was scheduled to
receive a visitor at 10 o'clock, he would finish whatever else he
was doing at 9:58, clear off his desk, clear his mind of whatever
had gone before and prepare himself for the next scene.''
   _Perks up when women are present. Regan said everyone who
travels with the president has come to believe that Pan American
World Airways assigns its prettiest stewardesses to the plane
carrying the White House press corps. ``This happy circumstance did
not escape the president's notice,'' he wrote. ``When Air Force One
landed, the president always looked for the Pan Am stewardesses
from the press plane and gave them a fatherly wave. They waved back
enthusiastically, pretty young women in their uniforms smiling at
the most famous man in the world. It was a moment everyone looked
forward to on presidential journeys.''
   _Displays no enthusiasm for an annual tradition: accepting the
national Thanksgiving turkey. ``The president always groaned when
he saw this on his schedule and more than once suggested that the
vice president stand in for him,'' Regan wrote. ```Oh, no you
don't!'' I would reply. `You've got to have your picture taken with
the turkey, Mr. President _ it's tradition.''

   Democrats Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis squared off today in
the West Virginia and Nebraska primaries as an impassioned Jackson
made a new plea on behalf of family farmers and insisted it's not
too late for him to make a comeback in the presidential race.
   Dukakis called on Republican rival George Bush to detail his
knowledge of drug allegations against Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The Massachusetts governor's comments on Monday came as aides to
Bush fielded mounting questions about when the vice president first
became aware of the allegations against the Panamanian strongman,
who was indicted on federal drug charges in February. Bush did not
campaign Monday and had no campaign appearances scheduled today.
   In West Virginia today, Bill Harrington, the secretary of
state's chief of staff, said, ``The weather's real good throughout
the state. In the counties we've talked to, we've had a respectable
turnout.''
   In Nebraska, Jackson spoke with reporters after spending the
night at the rural home of Vern and Dorothy Law. He said, ``Family
farmers have become isolated from the political process.''
   ``ConAgra and Cargill can't supply the economic nutrition to
this country that family farmers can,'' he said, referring to the
giant food and grain conglomerates.
   On Monday, Jackson staged a primary-eve scramble for votes in
Nebraska and West Virginia, while Dukakis, who has taken the last
few days off from campaigning, spent the day at the Statehouse in
Boston.
   ``This is a live race. ... Every voter counts,'' Jackson
declared Monday as he campaigned in Omaha, Neb. In Martinsburg,
W.Va., he told supporters: ``I'm coming to the last lap. I'm
running longer and running stronger because my mind is made up. ...
Press on! Press on!''
   Dukakis campaigned in the two states last week.
   Today's contests do not offer an especially large share of
Democratic delegates _ 37 in West Virginia and 25 in Nebraska. Of
the 2,081 delegates needed to nominate, Dukakis has 1,519.7 to
Jackson's 933.1 according to the Associated Press' count.
   But two more victories would help cement Dukakis' grip on the
nomination, which aides have been saying he could clinch in the
season-closing primaries June 7 in California and New Jersey.
   For Jackson _ who won last week's District of Columbia primary
but notched no primary victories in the six weeks prior to that _ a
strong showing in either state would be a welcome respite.
   Even before today's contests were decided, Jackson was heading
for the next battleground: Oregon, which holds its primary a week
from today, with 45 Democratic delegates at stake.
   Dukakis met Monday with New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, and aides
said the two talked about U.S.-Soviet relations. Bush has already
made Dukakis' lack of foreign policy experience an issue.
   Bradley said he did not think Dukakis was vulnerable on the
issue. ``Experience is no substitute for ability and he's got real
ability,'' Bradley said.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, zeroed in on a foreign-policy matter that is
becoming a sticky one for Bush: Noriega, and the Reagan
administration's dealings with him.
   ``Who was dealing with him and why?'' Dukakis said. ``Were we
paying him and if so why? I can tell you one thing: If I'm the
president we won't be doing business with drug-running Panamanian
dictators.''
   Questions about Bush and Noriega flared up anew when The New
York Times, quoting unidentified administration officials, said
Sunday that the former U.S. ambassador to Panama, Everett E.
Briggs, had told Bush in December 1985 about the allegations. But
Briggs, now posted to Honduras, told reporters he had not presented
Bush with evidence of a Noriega-drug link.
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said Monday that Bush was aware of
rumors of drug involvement by the Noriega government prior to
Noriega's indictment. Teeley said the reports were unsubstantiated,
and Panama was one of a number of countries about which there were
such reports.
   In other developments:
   _The Dukakis campaign said the Democratic front-runner would be
receiving Secret Service protection effective Wednesday.
   _The National Organization for Women released a list of
prominent Democratic women Monday, saying the Democratic Party
should consider them for key convention roles as well as for the
vice presidential nomination. The list of 47 current and former
officeholders included Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado; Vermont
Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin; Rep. Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut;
Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire; former San Francisco Mayor Dianne
Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
   _Dukakis came under renewed attack from former Democratic Gov.
Edward J. King of Massachusetts, who beat him in 1978 but was
defeated by Dukakis in 1982. King, who subsequently switched
parties, said Monday in a speech in Cambridge, Mass. that Dukakis
deserves no credit for the state's economic turnaround. King has
appeared on television and radio shows in recent weeks to criticize
Dukakis, with his expenses paid for by the Bush campaign.
   _ Pat Robertson, who technically remains a Republican candidate
although Bush has a mathematical lock on the nomination, addressed
a GOP gathering in Pittsburgh Monday night. The former television
evangelist has said he will work to elect a Republican in the fall,
but added: ``I'm still campaigning in my own right ... I'm not
finished yet.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dissidents today accused police of breaking
into the office of an unofficial journal and arresting editor
Sergei Grigoryants without arrest or search warrants. They demanded
his immediate release.
   Grigoryants' wife, Tamara, told a news conference in Moscow
police still were guarding the small country house outside the city
where Grigoryants was arrested Monday.
   Andrei Babitsky, an editor of Grigoryants' Glasnost magazine,
said almost 400 copies of the journal and a new publication for
young people had been taken from the house.
   Grigoryants, a former political prisoner, had agreed to allow a
group seeking to found a political party called the Democratic
Union to challenge the Communist Party to hold its final organizing
session at his editorial office Monday afternoon.
   `He is not a member of the group,'' Mrs. Grigoryants said of her
husband. ``He intended to be there as an observer, nothing more.''
   The house is in the village of Kratkovo, about 25 miles
southeast of Moscow, in an area closed to foreigners.
Correspondents could not travel there to get first-hand information.
   After the arrest of Grigoryants and several others, about 70
people gathered at a nearby club to form the political party, which
calls for multi-party parliamentary democracy, independent trade
unions, a new constitution and withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe and areas of the Soviet Union seized in World War II.
   During the weekend, 60 of the group's supporters were reported
arrested in Moscow and one of its founders, Yuri Mityunov, said
Monday that 14 remained in jail.
   Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called for more
democratic election procedures, including multiple-candidate
elections. Grigoryants' magazine is named for Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost _ openness on some social issues.
   Lawyer Valentin Yelisyenko said police had no arrest warrant for
Grigoryants or any of the others, and no search warrant to enter
the building.
   He said he was allowed to talk to Grigoryants at the local
police station about five hours after the arrest, and even then
police had no documents that would have permitted them to make the
arrest.
   The Independent Union of Journalists of the USSR, a group
publishers of unofficial journalist which Grigoryants heads, issued
a statement saying, ``the repressive measures against the chief
editor of the journal Glasnost we regard as one of the main signals
that governing organs of the country are undermining those hopes
they sowed in the spirits of the people.''
   It demanded that Grigoryants be freed at once, that impounded
copies of Glasnost be returned, court action be started against
police who arrested Grigoryants. The statement also said that if
there is a legal basis for action against Grigoryants, the reason
should be stated publicly.
   Babitsky said police first arrested Grigoryants outside the
house. Twenty minutes later they returned, broke down five doors
and arrested four other people, he said. He said Grigoryants did
not resist.
   Grigoryants later was found guilty of disobeying a police
officer and given a seven-day jail sentence, but Yeliseyenko told
reporters that dissidents had not been able to determine the
charges against the other men.
   Dissidents said they were told police acted on a complaint by
the daughter of a 96-year-old woman who rented the country house to
Grigoryants that he had no right to be there.
   Mrs. Grigoryants said her husband had reached a valid agreement
with the woman in January to rent the house.

<TEXT>
   Aloha Airlines has decided to permanently remove
from service three aging Boeing 737 jetliners that were grounded
after another Aloha jet blew open on an inter-island hop last month.
   Milton Goto, an Aloha spokesman, called the Monday move a
business decision designed to maintain public confidence, and not a
result of any problems.
   ``In our opinion these aircraft are very airworthy,'' Goto said.
``But because the investigation has focused on aircraft cycles, age
and possible structural problems associated with age, we feel there
is a cloud over these airplanes.''
   Aloha grounded the planes April 29, a day after a flight
attendant was killed and 61 passengers were injured when part of
the passenger cabin's roof tore off Aloha Flight 243. Pilots were
able to land the plane on the island of Maui.
   The jet carrying 89 passengers, five crew members and an air
traffic controller, blew open at 24,000 feet, exposing passengers
to open air.
   An aircraft cycle refers to the number of times an airplane has
taken off and landed.
   Federal investigators said the jet that blew open April 28 had
about 89,000 cycles. Goto said the three jets removed from service
had about 50,000, 60,000 and 85,000 cycles respectively.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators suspect
structural failure brought on by age may have caused the front 20
feet of the 19-year-old plane's passenger cabin to tear away.
   ``The NTSB won't complete its investigation for months, but we
feel a responsibility to the public to maintain confidence,'' Goto
said.
   Goto said Aloha plans to lease planes to replace the three
jetliners permanently removed from service.
   Goto said the three jets would remain grounded until Aloha
officials are sure they are airworthy, then the airline will decide
whether to sell or scrap them.
   ``Fortunately, Aloha is a very financially strong airline,''
Goto said.

   Jesse Jackson spent the night before
Nebraska's primary at a farmhouse, then urged family farmers today
to join with urban factory workers to bring about change in the
political system.
   ``Family farmers have become isolated from the political
process,'' Jackson told reporters gathered on the front lawn of the
rural home of Vern and Dorothy Lau.
   ``ConAgra and Cargill can't supply the economic nutrition to
this country that family farmers can,'' he said, referring to the
giant food and grain conglomerates.
   Jackson spent the night at the Lau home after a day of
pre-primary campaigning in Omaha and Lincoln. He also stayed at
their home during the 1984 presidential campaign.
   Since then, the Laus have been forced by economic problems to
auction their equipment, sell all but 10 acres and the nearly
100-year-old family home and have taken jobs in Lincoln.
   After campaigning in West Virginia, which also has its primary
today, Jackson flew to Nebraska on Monday.
   Jackson, who trails Democratic rival Michael Dukakis in public
opinion surveys, stood on a dumpster in Omaha's Hilltop housing
project and declared: ``The polls, the pundits, the press will not
determine who will win ... That's your decision.''
   Monday's visit was Jackson's second to Nebraska, and his extra
time in the state could help him at the polls Tuesday. The
Democratic candidate who spends the most time in Nebraska
traditionally does well in the presidential primary in the mostly
Republican state.
   Despite the 600-delegate gap that divides him Dukakis, Jackson
said he was within striking distance of the nomination. To
nominate, 2,081 delegates are needed.
   ``I have the longest legs, the strongest legs ... As the days
get longer, the race gets stronger,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson, whose day began around 4 a.m. in West Virginia,
appeared tired and sounded somewhat hoarse. But he spoke at length,
sounding his campaign themes of stopping drugs and promoting fair
wages, fair prices and fair taxes.
   ``Let's stop playing urban and rural against each other,'' he
said. ``We need each other.
   ``We need family farmers. They're the best stewards of our
soil,'' he said, denouncing big agribusinesses.
   Walking through the housing project, Jackson carried first a
little girl on his shoulders and then a little boy as the people
crowded around him.
   Walking around the project, Jackson was joined by actress Margot
Kidder, known for her role as Lois Lane in the ``Superman'' movies.
   Jackson later traveled to Lincoln for another rally. About 2,500
people, many not yet old enough to vote, packed a high school gym.
   ``Why are people here tonight? ... Hope has been reborn,''
Jackson said. When hope is reborn, ``it chases away our doubts and
fears.''
   Jackson said the nation``doesn't just need to change presidents,
we need to change direction.''

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed a guerrilla in
a clash in south Lebanon today, the military command said.
   It was the first confirmed battle involving Israeli troops there
since a two-day Israeli incursion last week left three soldiers and
more than 40 Shiite Moslem guerrillas dead.
   No Israeli casualties were reported in today's clash, which
occurred shortly after midnight near the village of Taire five
miles north of the Israeli border.
   The military said the guerrilla was killed on the edge of the
``security zone'' Israel created when it withdrew most troops from
Lebanon in June 1985 after a three-year occupation.
   The army said Israeli soldiers spotted a guerrilla squad that
tried to infiltrate into the security zone and plant land mines on
roads used by Israeli troops. It said the guerrilla who was killed
carried a rifle, a Katyusha rocket and two land mines.
   The army did not say to which group the guerrillas belonged.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Verification Problems Resolved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
today he did not know what problems were holding up U.S. Senate
ratification of the medium-range missile treaty.
   Shevardnadze, speaking to reporters after arriving in Geneva for
a meeting later this week with Secretary of State George Shultz,
indicated the Soviet Union had not made any new proposals to
resolve the verification dispute which has arisen in the Senate.
   ``Basically the verification problems regarding the INF treaty
have been resolved, I think,'' he said in answer to a reporter's
question. ``I'm not quite clear what the problems ... in the Senate
are. We have not been told yet.''
   Shevardnadze said the U.S. side ``was asking certain questions,
certain points of clarification'' on the verification issue. ``We
answered those questions and we thought that there is no problem,''
he said.
   He said that on other questions, not dealing with verification,
``we have brought new ideas.'' He said the ideas were ``in all
areas,'' but he did not elaborate.
   President Reagan and Soviet Communist Party chief Mikhail
Gorbachev signed an agreement Dec. 8 to eliminate the two sides'
medium and shorter-range nuclear weapons.
   But the U.S. Senate decided Monday to delay consideration of the
treaty, saying serious disagreements had arisen over verification,
or anti-cheating measures.
   Senators looked to the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting to settle the
dispute.
   Shevardnadze also said that he did not think the two sides would
conclude an accord on reducing strategic, or intercontinental,
nuclear arms before the scheduled Moscow summit beginning May 29.
But he said they could ``consolidate progress'' made since December.
   After the December summit in Washington, Reagan and Gorbachev
instructed their arms control negotiators to try to complete a
treaty on strategic missiles to be signed in Moscow.
   Shevardnadze said the two sides have made progress since
December, and will continue their work after his meeting with
Shultz.
   ``If we are not able to complete an agreement before Moscow we
will continue after Moscow,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze said the ministers would have to do ``a great deal
of work'' during their two-day Geneva meeting in order to prepare
documents for the Moscow summit.
   He predicted that meeting would ``summarize the very
substantial'' work done since December ``and on the basis of that
we shall determine the prospects of our work in the future.''
   Shevardnadze said the meeting with Shultz would be their 26th
since Shevardnadze took office July 2, 1985. He said the agenda
would also include conventional weapons, nuclear testing, regional
problems and bilateral issues.

<HEAD>Pope Says Foreign Debt Cause of Social and Political Instability</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATEs throughout with pope criticizing profits made on
loans to Third World nations. No pickup. Edits to tighten.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, in his first full day
in South America's most impoverished country, today criticized
``the abysmal differences between rich and poor countries'' and the
profits made by banks on loans to Third World nations.
   Several hundred thousand people gathered for a late-morning Mass
the pontiff celebrated in a dusty open field encircled by the
snow-capped Andean peaks near La Paz's international airport,
13,150 feet above sea level.
   Earlier, the pope met with diplomats at the papal nuncio's
residence in the center of the city.
   ``The abysmal differences between rich and poor countries are
incompatible with divine designs of a just and equal sharing of the
goods of creation,'' John Paul said.
   He said the underdevelopment of the Third World, and
particularly its foreign debts, spawned social and political
instability in many countries.
   ``The imbalance between the amount of this debt and the capacity
to pay it, the difference between the sums loaned and the profits
demanded by creditors, is causing very grave damage to many poor
countries,'' he said.
   Thousands of people, including peasants in Indian dress and
traditional bowler hats, greeted the pontiff at the La Paz airport
after his arrival from Uruguay on Monday.
   He appealed to them ``not to lose hope.''
   ``I will spend five days among you, sharing your aspirations,
seeing first-hand this nation stricken by poverty and a lack of
development and resources,'' he said.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro, who welcomed the pope, said in
his speech that the visit would help bolster the flagging spirits
of Bolivians.
   Bolivia, devastated by unemployment and crime, is South
America's poorest country. Its $4.2 billion foreign debt is about
eight times its annual gross national product.
   ``You come at a time when Bolivia is suffering bitter tests that
could weaken its spirit or perhaps sink it into a state of
desperation,'' the 80-year-old president said.
   On Monday, the pope addressed the country's 39 bishops, asking
them to ``defend themselves against the proselytist activity of
sects that, in recent times, are multiplying in Bolivia.
   ``These fundamentalist sects are sowing confusion among the
people and, unfortunately, could very soon dilute the coherence and
unity of the evangelical message,'' John Paul said.
   During the meeting, the 67-year-old pontiff seemed to tire.
Bishop Julio Terrazas, head of the Bolivian Episcopal conference,
refrained from delivering his address to the pope because ``we see
that the pope is tired.''
   He handed the pontiff a copy of his speech, in which he says
Bolivia suffers from ``a situation of injustice that consumes
thousands of brothers in degrading misery and inhumane
unemployment.''
   John Paul will visit seven Bolivian cities, ranging from the
tin-mining center of Oruro, devastated by mine closures, to the
lowland boom town of Santa Cruz, a center of ranching, agriculture
and cocaine trafficking.
   Bolivia's flourishing cocaine industry supplies an estimated
one-third of the U.S. and the Eurpean market.
   The pope's South American tour, his ninth, began Friday in
Uruguay and will take him to Peru and Paraguay, where he will spend
his 68th birthday before returning to Rome on May 18.
   The pontiff has made 37 pilgrimages abroad since he became head
of the 800-million-member Roman Catholic Church nearly a decade ago.

<HEAD>O'Hare Delays Minimal, But Blaze Keeps Phones Silent; End Not in
Sight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline delays in the area were said to be
minimal today, but telephone outages were still widespread
following a weekend fire that put callers and aircraft on hold.
   There is no relief in sight for some 35,000 telephone customers
in western suburbs following the fire at a switching station in
Hinsdale, an Illinois Bell official said.
   Flights were delayed for two hours Monday at O'Hare
International Airport because air traffic controllers at the
Federal Aviation Administration's control center in Aurora had
difficulty communicating with the O'Hare control tower, FAA
spokesman Mort Edelstein said this morning.
   He said communications broke down because of the switching
station fire and Sunday's storm, with its 80 mph winds.
   ``Right now, 12 of the 28 circuits are back in business. There's
minimal (flight) delays,'' said Edelstein. ``We anticipate that by
Wednesday we'll have 100 percent of the circuits working.''
   Midway, Chicago's other airport, was affected by the
communications problem and O'Hare's delays had a ripple effect on
airports in other cities, Edelstein said.
   No immediate remedy is expected for the customers without
telephone service, said Illinois Bell spokesman Dick Hill. ``It's
going to be sometime late this week. That would be about the safest
thing we could say.''
   At Hinsdale Hospital, nurses were carrying walkie-talkies, ham
radio operators were on hand to call doctors outside the area and a
messenger service was set up to reach local physicians in
emergencies.
   None of Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s catalog-sales phones in the
Chicago area were working and one of the company's stores in
suburban Oak Brook was without phone service Monday, said spokesman
Doug Fairweather for the Chicago-based retailer.
   The fire also forced a shutdown of off-track wagering on
Monday's thoroughbred horse races at Sportsman's Park, although
on-track betting was not affected.
   In Hinsdale, Illinois Bell parked a bus with nine phones for
emergency use and portable radio units were set up at schools,
churches and major intersections in neighboring Clarendon Hills,
also for emergency use.
   Fire departments from 15 communities battled the fire at the
Hinsdale station, west of Chicago, for three hours before it was
brought under control Sunday evening. The cause of the fire is
still unknown.
   The station houses computerized switching equipment that serves
customers by connecting their local calls directly to the number
dialed and routing long-distance calls.
   Customers in the Chicago suburbs of Hinsdale, Willowbrook,
Clarendon Hills and parts of Darien, Burr Ridge and unincorporated
Oak Brook were completely out of service, said Illinois Bell
spokeswoman Laura Littel.
   Ms. Littel said phones were dead for 35,000 customers, but the
number of consumers whose service was only partly interrupted was
unknown.

   A defense attorney today asked jurors not to
be ``bullied by public opinion'' when they consider the fate of a
man accused of killing 16 people, while a prosecutor said in his
opening statement that he would demand the death penalty.
   Prosecutor John Bynum summarized in a 15-minute statement the
crimes for which R. Gene Simmons, 47, of Dover, is on trial.
   The retired Air Force master sergeant is accused of fatally
shooting former co-worker Kathy C. Kendrick, 24, and James D.
Chaffin, 33, during a Dec. 28 rampage in Russellville. Officials
said Ms. Kendrick spurned Simmons' advances a year before her death
and that Chaffin was a chance victim.
   If convicted of murder, Simmons could be sentenced to death or
life in prison without parole. In addition to two counts of murder,
he is charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of
kidnapping.
   Trial is set July 18 for the deaths of Simmons' wife and 13
other relatives who were shot or strangled during the Christmas
holidays before the shooting rampage. Their bodies were found on
Simmons' property, 47 miles east of Ozark.
   Bynum said Miss Kendrick was shot four times in the head. He
also said a woman wounded by Simmons was first shot in the head as
she sat at a desk at a Russellville business. After she fell, he
said, Simmons went around the desk.
   ``He stood over and he fired another shot into her chest, near
her heart,'' the prosecutor said.
   Defense attorney Robert E. ``Doc'' Irwin, during an 11-minute
statement, asked jurors to consider variations in statements given
by witnesses in describing the assailant.
   ``The defense asks that you not be bullied by public opinion, by
what the press may say or by what the public may say,'' Irwin said.
   Police Chief Herb Johnston of Russellville, the first witness,
explained the order of the shootings at four Russellvile businesses
and identified Simmons as the man who handed him one of the
.22-caliber revolvers the police say was used in the shootings.
   The trial in the two deaths was moved here after the defense
said pretrial publicity prevented selection of an impartial jury in
Pope County.
   During the six hours it took to pick the jury Monday, Simmons
murmured to his attorneys and chatted with reporters covering the
case, asking for copies of their news stories. Security at the
Franklin County courthouse was tight, with up to 10 officers inside
the courtroom.
   Irwin objected after prospective juror Jack Morton of Ozark told
Judge John Patterson, ``I know too much. I've been working down
around Dover a little bit. I've got my mind already made up.''
   As the judge ordered Morton to stop talking, Irwin moved for
rejection of the panel of prospective jurors and a mistrial.
Patterson denied the motions, saying no harm had been done.
   The state struck seven jurors and the defense only one.
Patterson excused nine others, generally because they said they
already believed Simmons was guilty.
   Asked whether he could be impartial, Robert Agee, 48, of Ozark
replied, ``As much as I've seen and heard, it may be hard to do,
but I'll do my best.''
   Agee agreed with Irwin that community sentiment was that the
death penalty would be appropriate for Simmons, but promised to
return a verdict of innocent if not convinced of the defendant's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
   ``I have to make unpopular decisions every day,'' said Agee,
general manager of the Arkansas Valley Electric Cooperative Corp.
He was seated.
   The slayings made nationwide news, but the trial appeared to be
having little effect on this northwest Arkansas town of 3,600. Most
of the spectators in the courtroom Monday were reporters.
   Tracy Clary, 18, a senior at Ozark High School, said she was
unaware of the trial until she heard classmates say their parents
were among those summoned for possible jury duty.
   ``People are taking it in stride,'' Miss Clary said.
   ``It's a big topic in town,'' she added. ``People have strong
opinions about the guy and what he did in Russellville.''

   An effort to save money by closing unneeded
military bases is ``the stickiest wicket'' in the Pentagon budget
bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,
said today.
   Senators discussed whether to give the Defense Department
authority to close bases, with many legislators loath to shut down
facilities and lose jobs in their states.
   Dixon, reflecting the political sensitivity of the issue, said
the plan was ``the stickiest wicket in this bill.''
   The bill includes a provision creating a seven-member commission
that would recommend by Dec. 31 which of the 3,800 U.S. military
installations could be shut down.
   The proposal is an attempt to circumvent congressional
opposition to shutting bases. The military has not closed any major
bases since 1977, when Congress erected a series of stiff rules.
Pentagon officials say that between $2 billion and $5 billion a
year could be saved if unneeded installations were closed.
   Dixon, noting the proposed base-closing commission doesn't
include any legislators, has suggested increasing the panel to 13.
The other six members would all be Senate or House members,
including Dixon.
   ``The way this is written would given absolute power to the
Department of Defense,'' said Dixon.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said, ``the publics in our communities
rely on these bases...when and if we close any bases, it better not
look political.'' Adding legislators ``is the best way to give this
credibility,'' he said.
   Between 1961 and 1977, the Pentagon closed or reduced 3,600
installations, saving an estimated $5 billion a year. But because
of the legal roadblocks erected by Congress, none have been closed
since then.
   The Pentagon has even given up formally proposing base closures
because of the strong Capitol Hill opposition.
   Last week, in announcing the seven-member commission, Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci noted that ``some have suggested that
this may be an exercise in futility.''
   The proposal in the Senate bill will be considered by the House
as separate legislation.
   As the Senate began work on the bill Monday, the leaders of
Senate Armed Services Committee warned that Pentagon spending
probably won't be increased for several years unless federal budget
problems are solved.
   The bill authorizes the Pentagon to spend $299.5 billion in
fiscal 1989, about the same amount permitted in the current year.
   The bill would provide the fourth consecutive year of little or
no increase in Pentagon spending after the large increases during
Reagan's first term.
   The bill's spending total was part of the so-called budget
summit last December between Reagan and congressional leaders as
part of the drive to reduce federal spending.
   That is about $33 billion less than the Pentagon thought it
would have next year. The reductions were ordered by Carlucci, who
approved cuts in personnel and the entire retirement of some
weapons, including 16 aging Navy frigates.
   The bill that eventually passes the Senate will be reconciled
with the separate Pentagon budget bill that the House will consider
later this week. The House spent two weeks voting on its measure
and is scheduled to finally approve the bill on Wednesday.
   While both bills provide $299.5 billion, there are a number of
major differences. For example, the House measure proposes $3.5
billion for Star Wars, compared with the $4.6 billion figure in the
Senate bill. Reagan sought $4.8 billion.

<TEXT>
   Death row inmate James Edward Smith
wants his execution to proceed as planned Wednesday morning, but
his mother wants the U.S. Supreme Court to rule he isn't competent
to select death over life.
   Attorneys representing Alexine Hamilton filed an appeal with the
U.S. Supreme Court on Monday after the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals denied an execution stay, said Bob Walt, an assistant Texas
attorney general.
   The state of Texas planned to file a response with the high
court today, after which the justices would consider the case, Walt
said.
   Smith today requested ``Rhaeakunda dirt'' for his final meal, a
request Texas Department of Corrections officials said would not be
honored.
   ``It's not food, it's not sanitary,'' prison spokesman David
Nunnelee said. ``He'll be offered something off the regular prison
menu.''
   Smith, 37, was convicted in the 1983 robbery-slaying of a
Houston insurance office manager. Mrs. Hamilton, of Indianapolis,
claims her son is mentally incompetent.
   Telephone messages left at the office and home of Mrs.
Hamilton's Austin attorney, Ray Donley, were not returned Monday
evening. Mrs. Hamilton, reached at her Indianapolis home Monday
afternoon, said she was unaware of the Texas ruling, and said she
wasn't sure what legal strategy would be followed.
   Smith has no attorney and has resisted any attempts for legal
help from capital punishment opponents.
   ``Mr. Smith doesn't want to be represented,'' Robert McGlassen
of the Capital Punishment Clinic at the University of Texas Law
School said Monday. ``He hasn't asked for our help.''
   McGlassen said the execution should not be carried out because
the U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge to the Texas
death penalty statute.
   Since the high court agreed to hear the case of death row inmate
Donald Gene Franklin, inmates routinely have won stays of
execution. A decision in the Franklin case is expected soon.
   Convicted killer Robert Streetman, who also asked to be put to
death, is the only inmate executed in Texas so far this year.
   ``The man has a right to make his own choice,'' said Bob Walt,
an assistant attorney general. ``If he wants to file an appeal, I'm
not going to deprive a man of his day in court.''
   Smith, a former tarot card dealer in New Orleans who was working
as a Houston taxi driver, was convicted for the 1983 shooting death
of Larry Rohus.
   Testimony at his trial showed he was tackled by witnesses while
fleeing the shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was
linked to the Rohus slaying.
   Smith repeatedly has said he is innocent, but says he does not
want to spend the rest of his life withering away on death row.
   He also has accused death penalty opponents of caring little for
him personally while urging him to seek a stay to further their own
philosophical goals.
   If he receives lethal injection, he will be the 28th prisoner
executed in Texas and the 99th nationally since the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1976 allowed capital punishment to resume.

owner Peter S. Kalikow announced today.
   Ms. Amsterdam, 36, will start work June 13 and be listed
officially as executive editor until the departure of the current
editor, Frank Devine, Kalikow said in a statement. Devine is
returning to Australia by year's end.
   He stayed on after Rupert Murdoch sold the paper in March to
real-estate developer Kalikow, who made Peter O. Price publisher.
   ``We are delighted to be bringing in an editor of Jane
Amsterdam's caliber,'' Price said today in a statement. ``Her
reputation for editorial integrity and excellence is well-known.''
   Ms. Amsterdam was an editor in the Style section and the
investigative unit of The Washington Post, and executive editor at
New Times, American Lawyer and New York magazines.
   She is generally credited with making a success of
Manhattan,inc., which was founded in 1984 as an upscale city
magazine that treated top business executives as celebrities.
   She resigned in March 1987 after a disagreement over editorial
autonomy with the owner of the magazine, D. Herbert Lipson. In
January, she joined the publishing house of Alfred A. Knopf as a
senior editor.
   According to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Ms.
Amsterdam would become the sixth woman holding the position of top
editor at a newspaper with a circulation of more than 100,000.
   The Post is the nation's oldest continually published daily
newspaper.

<TEXT>
   Michel Rocard, a Socialist known for his appeal to
France's political center, was chosen today by President Francois
Mitterrand to succeed conservative Jacques Chirac as premier.
   Chirac, defeated Sunday when Mitterrand swept to re-election to
a new seven-year term, visited the presidential Elysee Palace to
submit his resignation, ending two years of an uneasy power-sharing
between a conservative premier and Socialist president.
   Mitterrand's chief of staff, Jean-Louis Bianco, made a terse
announcement about 2{ hours later, saying only the 57-year-old
Rocard would be the new premier and providing no details of who
would serve in the Cabinet.
   The new premier will be expected to invite non-Socialists into
the Cabinet to demonstrate an appeal beyond the party's boundaries.
   Because Chirac still has support of the center-right majority
coalition in the National Assembly, the constitution did not
require him to step down and the president could not dismiss him.
   But there was never any doubt Chirac would quit following his
defeat at the polls. Mitterrand won re-election with 54 percent of
the vote to Chirac's 46 percent.
   Rocard always has been rated among the most popular politicians
in public opinion polls. He is known for stating his opinions
whether or not they coincided with his party's.
   Rocard resigned as agriculture minister in the Socialist
government of Premier Laurent Fabius in 1985, saying he could not
support a change to a new system of electing the National Assembly
that distributed seats among parties based on their proportion of
the vote.
   The Socialists control just 211 seats in the 577-member National
Assembly, so the new premier will need to form either a firm
coalition with centrist forces, or make temporary alliances on
particular issues.
   Mitterrand also could dissolve the body and call new elections,
but he has said he would do so only if his first government loses a
vote of confidence.
   The center-right Union for French Democracy, which teamed up
with Chirac's neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic in the government
for the past two years, said in a statement that it would not
automatically vote to censure the new government. It said it would
judge the new premier's proposals on their individual merits.
   The extreme-right National Front said its leader, Jean-Marie Le
Pen, ``has become at this hour the de facto leader of the national
and popular opposition to organize the France of French people
against socialism.''
   Le Pen drew a surprising 14.4 percent of the vote in the first
round of the presidential election on April 24, when Chirac won
just 19.9 percent and Mitterrand received 34.1 percent.

   Four of Wall Street's biggest firms said today
they had indefinitely suspended a highly profitable computerized
method of trading stocks because of widespread criticism that it is
causing volatility and destroying investor confidence.
   The announcements by Salomon Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley &
Co., PaineWebber Inc. and Bear Stearns & Co. came amid an uproar
about so-called index-arbitrage program trading and a protracted
slump in the stock market since the October crash nearly seven
months ago.
   The firms' actions came a week after the New York Stock Exchange
intensified post-crash limits on program trading, blamed for
causing enormous swings in stock prices for reasons unrelated to
underlying values.
   Salomon and Morgan are among the most significant users of the
technique, which uses high-volume computers to sell stocks in New
York and buy equivalent stock-index futures in Chicago, or vice
versa, to profit from fleeting price disparities.
   Bear Stearns and PaineWebber is considered a smaller user of
program trading.
   Salomon, Morgan and Painewebber said they were suspending the
technique as of today for their own accounts although they would
continue to do it for customers if requested.
   Bear Stearns said it had suspended the technique for its own
account as well as customer accounts as of last Thursday, but
didn't publicize it until the other firms made announcements today.
   ``I think it's certainly a move in the right direction,'' said
Jack Barbanel, head of commodities and financial futures at the New
York brokerage Gruntal & Co. ``It's meaningul because at least
there's beginning to be an acknowledgment to the public perception
that program trading causes turbulence.''
   Large numbers of investors have complained to the NYSE and their
brokers that program trading has compelled them to get out of
stocks because they believe it has made the market more like a
gambling casino. Brokers also are growing resentful of the
relatively small number of program traders.
   Moreover, there is a belief in the securities industry that
lawmakers will take severe legislative action aimed at restoring
investor confidence unless brokerage firms can find ways to reform
themselves.
   ``We have decided to suspend any non-customer-related index
arbitrage activity with the goal of furthering the serious analysis
of the role of index arbitrage in market volatility,''
PaineWebber's chairman and chief executive, Donald B. Marron, said
in a statement.
   ``It is our hope that all interest regulators and market
participants work together in an objective manner to find an
intelligent and mutually acceptable solution to this issue.''
   John Gutfreund, chairman and chief executive of Salomon, said in
a statement that his firm ``will abstain from all domestic stock
index propriatary arbitrage for the present time.''
   ``It is necessary for all to work toward the goal of restoring
confidence in and guaranteeing the vibrancy of the marketplace,''
he said.
   Morgan said in a statement that ``the efforts of our industry,
the exchanges, the regulators and Congress should be directed
towards expanding liquidity, reducing volatility and restoring
public confidence in the equity markets.''
   ``We have no present intention of starting again. That doesn't
mean we won't do it again,'' Alan C. Greenberg, Bear Stearns'
chairman and chief executive, said in an answer to a telephone
query. ``The profit is greatly overstated. If everybody thinks it's
so important (to stop), we'll give in to it.''

   Senate action on the U.S.-Soviet medium-range
missile treaty has ``been put on the back burner'' until there is a
resolution of complaints of alleged Kremlin backsliding on
inspection provisions, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said
today.
   The White House said it supported the delay.
   ``It could be resolved in a matter of hours, in a matter of
days, or it might never be resolved,'' Byrd, a West Virginia
Democrat, told reporters.
   The dispute could be settled quickly, but probably only if
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze offers concessions when
he meets with Secretary of State George P. Shultz later this week.
   ``The Soviets can resolve this fast,'' said Byrd. ``The thing
that can expedite this is for the administration and the Soviets to
sit down and close these loopholes.''
   ``We don't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat,'' he
said. ``This obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is
before the Senate takes up the treaty.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration backs the delay in the Senate debate.
   ``We feel this is a prudent and reasonable course of action,''
he said. ``There is unanimity between the administration and the
bipartisan Senate leadership that these problems should be
satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification.''
   ``The administration has made clear to the Soviets the need for
an expeditious solution,'' he said.
   Assistant Senate Republican Leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming and
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., emerging from a morning meeting with
President Reagan, said he was confident the problems can be
surmounted.
   ``We have much to do in the Senate. We have the three or four
issues to resolve. We're ready to do that,'' Simpson told reporters
outside the White House. ``We're all very interested in what will
take place with Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze.
I think that they will do their usual good job of splicing things
back together again.''
   ``We just hope that there are only misunderstandings on
verification and that after the Shultz-Shevardnadze talks, it'll be
clear that the INF treaty has some on-site provisions there that
are mutually agreed to,'' Lugar said.
   ``I don't think the president is pushing anybody. He wants
clarification of what we all meant,'' Lugar said.
   Shevardnadze, arriving in Geneva for the talks, said that,
``basically the verification problems ... have been resolved, I
think. I'm not quite clear what the problems ... in the Senate are.
We have not been told yet.''
   The foreign minister said the United States ``was asking certain
questions, certain points of clarification'' on the verification
issue. ``We answered those questions and we thought that there is
no problem,'' he said.
   A pall is certain to be cast over the planned Moscow summit
meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev if
the treaty dispute is not resolved by the time Reagan arrives in
the Soviet capital on May 29.
   Reagan had wanted to take a ratified treaty to Moscow for a
signing ceremony, but the delay may make that impossible, even if
the dispute itself is resolved by then.
   Byrd announced Monday that he was indefinitely postponing Senate
debate on ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or
INF, treaty. Debate had tentatively been set to begin Wednesday.
   After conferring with other senators and White House officials,
Byrd said a serious dispute over verification issues had arisen and
added:
   ``This treaty will not be brought up until these problems are
resolved. It is obvious that not only have the problems that had
previously surfaced not been resolved but that new problems have
arisen,'' he said.
   ``I think it behooves the Soviets to come forward with solutions
and permit the Senate to open the debate with our eyes open,'' Byrd
said. ``We don't want to walk off a cliff.''
   Byrd said he will not reschedule debate until assured by the
Senate Intelligence, Armed Services and Foreign Relations
committees that satisfactory on-site inspection procedures have
been agreed to by the Soviets in writing and that other problems
also have been resolved.
   Byrd acted after a meeting between senators and White House
chief of staff Howard H. Baker and national security adviser Colin
Powell.
   Leaving the meeting, Powell expressed approval of the decision,
saying, ``not a bad course of action.''
   The pact, the product of difficult negotiations dating to the
beginning of the Reagan administration in 1981, was signed amid
widespread celebration at last December's Reagan-Gorbachev summit
meeting here.
   It requires the elimination of all ground-launched missiles with
a range of from 300 to 3,400 miles.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman,
and Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, the vice chairman, said they were
surprised at the timing and nature of the Soviet action.
   They said there are about 10 outstanding and unresolved
verification issues. Boren said the Soviets are apparently adamant
``beyond their usual bargaining stance.''
   ``To have the Soviets ... reneging is very alarming to me,''
Boren said. ``There is some real perverseness here.''
   He said Soviet officials have ``turned us down flatly'' on some
verification issues previously thought to have been settled while
adopting a position of ``deliberate ambiguity'' on others.
   Cohen speculated that the Soviets are attempting to use leverage
in the days before the Moscow summit ``to get what they couldn't
get at the bargaining table.''
   ``This will either be resolved quickly or it won't be resolved
at all,'' Cohen said.
   The verification dispute centers mostly on access of U.S.
monitors to Soviet missile plants and sites.
   The Soviets are trying to restrict inspection of missile
containers to those large enough to carry an entire rocket. The
United States wants the right to examine smaller containers that
could carry a missile stage.
   Secondly, a U.S. official said, the Soviets are trying to place
off limits parts of areas designated for inspection.
   The State Department last month asked the Soviets for an
explanation.
   Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin delivered Moscow's reply to the
department Sunday night. State Department officials then briefed
the Intelligence Committee on Monday.
   ``We don't consider the Soviet response to our questions fully
satisfactory,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``There's more work to be done.''

   Vietnam has informed China that as a
goodwill gesture it will free 68 Chinese fishermen who were caught
poaching in its waters, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
   The fishermen were caught March 23 and April 5 off the central
coastal province of Quang Nam-Danang, said the report, monitored in
Bangkok on Tuesday.
   It said the Chinese pleaded guilty and were disciplined, but
Hanoi decided to free them because of ``the traditional friendship
between the people of Vietnam and China.''
   Ngo Tat To, acting head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's
China department, on Monday told China's Ambassador to Hanoi, Li
Shichun, of the impending release, it said.
   Last week, To told Li that Vietnam would be freeing 22 Chinese
fishermen caught at Haiphong port in northern Vietnam.
   No dates were given for the releases.
   In March, the two communist nations fought a brief firefight in
the Spratly islands in the South China Sea. Vietnam has been trying
to get the release of nine sailors captured in the clash in the
islands, over which both nations claim sovereignty.

   Three-year-old Prince Harry, third in line to the
British throne, returned home Tuesday after surgery for a minor
hernia, Buckingham Palace said.
   The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana underwent
the operation Monday at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for
Sick Children, the hospital said.
   It said his condition was diagnosed recently and the operationd his
5-year-old brother, Prince
William.
   Diana canceled an exhibition opening Tuesday night but was
expected to continue her engagements Wednesday, the palace said.
   A hernia is the protrusion of all or part of an organ through a
tear in the wall of the surrounding structure. Hernias often
involve the protrusion of part of the intestine through the
abdominal muscles.
   Paul Jarrett, a surgeon at Kingston Hospital in London's
outskirts, said about one in 250 babies are born with a hernia.
   ``It is a simple operation done through a scar about 1 inch long
in the groin,'' he said. ``Children will be running about again
within a couple of days and after four or five days will be
fighting fit.''

<HEAD>Reagan Spurred to Tax Reform by Anecdote About His Secretary's
Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan, always a soft touch for a
personal anecdote, was convinced of the need to radically overhaul
the nation's tax law when told that his secretary paid more in
taxes than 60 of the largest U.S. corporations, Donald Regan writes
in his new book.
   The president's former treasury secretary and ex-chief of staff
takes much of the credit for passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act,
considered the major domestic achievement of Reagan's second term.
   In ``For the Record,'' which went on sale Monday, Regan writes
that the idea of simplifying the tax code by closing loopholes and
lowering tax rates was moribund when he took the cause to Reagan at
a White House meeting in late 1983.
   ``President Reagan liked to start every meeting off with a story
or a joke. So, as a way of introducing the subject, I asked him a
question about his old employer, General Electric,'' Regan said.
``What does General Electric have in common with Boeing, General
Dynamics and 57 other big corporations?''
   Reagan, remembering fondly his days as a goodwill ambassador for
GE, smiled and leaned forward for the punchline, only to be told,
``What these outfits have in common is that not one of them pays a
penny in taxes to the United States government. ... Your secretary
paid more in federal taxes last year than all of those giant
companies put together.''
   Regan describes the president as shocked and flushed with anger
by this news, saying he didn't realize things had gotten that far
out of line.
   While capturing the president's attention on this occasion,
Regan says he often failed in getting Reagan to focus on critical
economic issues, especially during the first term when Regan served
as treasury secretary.
   He describes an administration torn apart by internal squabbles
over huge budget deficits while the president remained remote and
detached.
   As treasury secretary, Regan said he was ``flying by the seat of
my pants.''
   ``The president never told me what he believed or what he wanted
to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure these
things out like any other American, by studying his speeches and
reading the newspapers,'' Regan says.
   He said that during four years as treasury secretary, he never
met alone with Reagan to discuss the president's economic
philosophy, and the orders he received from aides such as Edwin
Meese III seldom quoted the president or referred to his thoughts.
   ``I found this disembodied relationship bizarre,'' Regan said.
``For a while I struggled against a certain anxiety that this
method of running the world's greatest economy might wreck the new
presidency.''
   While crediting Reagan with creating ``an atmosphere of
confidence,'' that helped in the recovery from the 1981-82
recession, Regan said ``the president himself had very little to do
with the invention and the implementation of the policies'' that
came to be called ``Reaganomics.''
   Regan mentions frequent battles during the first term with
former budget director David Stockman; former White House chief of
staff James A. Baker III; Baker's assistant, Richard Darman; as
well as presidential economists Murray Weidenbaum and Martin
Feldstein.
   The others favored tax increases to lower the budget deficits
while Regan remained adamantly opposed, threatening to resign on
one occasion if the president accepted their recommendation.
   Stockman and Regan often clashed over Stockman's belief that the
president would have to accept tax increases or run the risk that
the federal deficit would balloon out of control.
   Stockman in his own tell-all book published in 1986 said Regan
had given the president ``unlimited bad advice for years and years
by essentially echoing and telling the president what he wants to
hear.''
   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker was criticized by
Regan for unsettling financial markets and prolonging the recession
by his traits of ``Delphic mysteriousness and a bureaucratic
fascination with tinkering.''
   In contrast to the harsh depiction of Nancy Reagan in the rest
of the book for her use of astrology and her behind-the-throne
power, Regan says the first came to his aid in 1982 at a time when
he had been shunted aside in the economic decision-making process
by Stockman and others.
   Mrs. Reagan called him to find out how he had answered a letter
from her stepbrother, Dr. Richard Davis, concerning the health of
the savings and loan industry. The discussion then moved to Regan's
general views on the economy.
   Regan quotes Mrs. Reagan as saying Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger was greedy for funds for the military and had no idea he
was hurting the economy.
   Mrs. Reagan said she felt the president needed to hear Regan's
views.
   ``I'll have Mike Deaver put you on the schedule to see him,''
she is quoted as saying.

   A fire early Tuesday heavily damaged a 12th
century church that had been partially destroyed by the Great Fire
of 1666 and rebuilt by Christopher Wren.
   Most of the roof and a four-story belltower at the St.
Mary-at-Hill church in London's City financial district were
destroyed in the three-hour blaze, said Fire Brigade spokesman
Colin Williamson.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, he said.
   The church was rebuilt in 1676 by Christopher Wren, who
incorporated the old tower and parts of the walls into a square,
Dutch-style church. A decade earlier, the Great Fire had destroyed
more than half the city.
   The interior, containing a magnificent organ case and pulpit, a
huge projecting clock, box pews and gilded sword rests, escaped
fire damage but may have been damaged by water from firefighters'
hoses, Williamson said.

   A volcano erupted on a small island in
the eastern Indonesian province of Maluku and forced 1,500 people
to flee to other islands, a provincial official said Tuesday.
   G.R. Atitulei, a senior official at the Maluku governor's office
in Ambon, said the 2,310-foot Mount Api on Gunung Api island, about
1,100 miles east of Jakarta, began spewing smoke and lava just
after dawn Monday.
   Ambon, a provincial city located 156 miles from the volcano, was
still shrouded in thick smoke Tuesday, Atitulei said in a telephone
interview.
   He said there were no casualties and that 300 families, or about
1,500 people, had been evacuated to Lontor and Hatta islands about
three miles away.
   The volcano raised the temperature ``much higher than normal''
on Banda Kecil island, 500 yards from Gunung Api, forcing its
inhabitants to flee, he said.

   A sharp earthquake described as a
``rolling jolt'' shook part of Northern California today, but there
were no immediate reports of damage.
   The earthquake hit at 5:32 a.m. with an estimated magnitude of
3.0 on the Richter scale, according to Willis Jacobs, a
geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo. He
said the epicenter was between Salinas and Watsonville.
   Carol Jones, a newspaper librarian at the Salinas Californian,
described the earthquake as ``sort of a rolling jolt.''
   ``I thought it was a truck going by but it kept going on,'' said
Jones, who was home at the time of the earthquake.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A quake with a magnitude of 5 has ten times the ground motion of
a temblor of magnitude 4. A temblor of magnitude 3 is capable of
only minor damage.

   Concern over rising inflation and foot-dragging
among bureaucrats could scuttle China's ambitious reform program
and trigger a return to Soviet-style central planning, a leading
economist warned Tuesday.
   Li Yining, dean of Beijing University's Economic Management
Department, said the main threat to China's economic development is
not its 11-percent annual inflation rate, but the possibility that
officials will halt reforms to control the price rises.
   Li, who spent six years in labor reform camps during the 1960s
and 1970s because he questioned central planning, said China's
prosperity depends on letting the market determine prices and
making independent entrepreneurs and family farmers the backbone of
the economy.
   ``The danger is that the need to stabilize the economic
situation will be used to bring back the traditional system,'' he
told a Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing news conference.
   China ``shouldn't be afraid of small price rises,'' he said.
   China's backward economy has grown rapidly in the past decade
due to market-style economic reforms introduced by senior leader
Deng Xiaoping. As the government has gradually lifted its
decade-old central controls, however, prices have soared,
generating widespread public discontent.
   The government said retail prices rose an average of 11 percent
in the first quarter of 1988, compared with 7.3 percent for all of
1987 and 6 percent in 1986.
   The jump has been even higher in large cities, where price
increases have soared as high as 19 percent. Prices of non-staple
foods have risen 30 percent in some places over the past year.
   Li said he agreed with Premier Li Peng's statement that
increasing supply of high-demand goods is the best solution. He
said he supported the government's recent decision to lift price
controls on more items, including pork, China's staple meat, and to
give urban consumers direct subsidies to compensate for price rises.
   But he said price reform should be carried out gradually over a
six- to 10-year period. Immediate de-control of all prices would
fuel inflation and lead to a run on bank deposits as price rises
outstripped bank interest rates, he said.
   The second threat to reform, Li said, is resistance among local
officials and enterprises who ``only know the old ways, and find it
hard to change.''
   He said the government ``needs to improve its propaganda work.
We must tell ordinary people that in the past they had stable
prices under conditions of poverty.''
   Socialism must be based on a commodity economy, Li said _ one in
which the market determines prices and allocation of materials and
labor.
   ``As long as the economy prospers and living standards are
raised, our purpose is fulfilled,'' he added. ``People will see
that socialism is not connected with poverty but wealth.''
   Asked about the need for democratic reforms to accompany
economic change, Li said, ``Socialist democracy ... can't develop
overnight. As long as we are moving in the right direction it is
fine.''

   A man who was sentenced to death 14 years
ago for the murders of a south Georgia family was given six life
sentences at his retrial today after a judge ruled jurors were
hopelessly deadlocked over the death penalty.
   The DeKalb County Superior Court jury had deliberated into a
seventh day without reaching a unanimous verdict in the sentencing
phase of Wayne Carl Coleman's retrial.
   Judge Hugh Lawson declared the jury deadlocked at 10:20 a.m.
today and sentenced Coleman to six consecutive life terms in
prison. Life is the automatic sentence when a jury fails to agree
on the death penalty.
   Silas Moore, spokesman for the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles, said Coleman is immediately eligible for parole
consideration, and that the board probably will consider the case
next month. If parole is denied, he said, the board can wait up to
eight years before hearing the case again.
   Moore said the case is covered by a 1964 law requiring parole
consideration after an inmate has served no more than seven years
of a life sentence. Coleman has been in jail since 1973.
   Defense attorney Tom West said he doubted he would appeal either
the sentence or the verdict. ``We feel that it's a vindication of
the right to a fair trial. Wayne's had a fair trial for the first
time.
   ``We can only assume that if Wayne had had a fair trial 15 years
ago, he would have gotten a life sentence,'' he said.
   Eleven members of the Alday family and Seminole County Sheriff
Jerry Godby, who originally investigated the murders, were present
when the sentence was announced. The family members broke into
tears.
   ``We've done our part. We'll just have to live with their
decision,'' said Patricia Alday Miller, the oldest daughter of
victim Ned Alday.
   She said the family, which has watched the trial since testimony
began in April, would immediately head home to Donalsonville.
   Lawson told the jury, ``The court understands that you would
have preferred to reach a unanimous verdict, but you should not
feel bad that you have not.''
   Coleman was one of three men sentenced to death in 1974 for the
May 14, 1973, slayings of Ned Alday; his brother Aubrey; Ned's sons
Jerry, Jimmy and Chester; and Jerry's wife, Mary.
   The men were shot to death in Jerry Alday's mobile home near
Donalsonville, and Mary Alday was killed in a nearby field after
she was repeatedly raped.
   The convictions of Coleman, Carl Isaacs and George Elder Dungee
were thrown out in 1985 by a federal appeals court that cited
pretrial publicity.
   Isaacs was convicted a second time in January and again
condemned to die. Dungee is to be retried later in Columbus.
   The DeKalb County jury, which found Coleman guilty of six counts
of murder on May 2, had been deliberating his sentence since last
Wednesday.
   The jury resumed deliberations today after a brief interruption
while the judge interviewed jurors who heard a remark about Coleman
while eating breakfast at a restaurant.
   Court officials said a customer told one juror, ``He's guilty,''
and the juror repeated the remark. Lawson told the jurors the
comment was improper and should have no effect on their
impartiality.
   During the lengthy sentencing deliberations, Lawson refused
repeated motions by Coleman's attorneys to declare the jury
deadlocked.
   Patsy Morris, case monitor for the American Civil Liberties
Union's Capital Litigation Project, said the length of the
deliberations was unusual, possibly unprecedented, in the

   ``The longest I can recollect in 10 years of handling cases like

   Isabella Rossellini, known for her
roles in dark films such as David Lynch's ``Blue Velvet,'' says she
is attracted to offbeat scripts and never gets offers for
mainstream movies.
   ``People say, `Why do you choose things that aren't commercial?'
All I can say is, `Because I do,''' she said recently. ``I don't
even go and see those very commercial movies, with car chases and
explosions. So maybe people sense that, because I've never gotten
one of those scripts.''
   Miss Rossellini, daughter of Ingrid Bergman and Roberto
Rossellini, is now promoting her latest starring role in the drama
``Zelly and Me.''
   She plays the loving nanny of a lonely orphaned girl in the
offbeat, low-budget film that co-stars Lynch.
   ``I wanted to do it as soon as I read the script,'' she said.

<HEAD>Anderson's Sister Meets With Freed French Hostage</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   COLLONGES-BELLERIVE, Switzerland (AP) _ Marcel Carton, a French
diplomat released last week from captivity in Lebanon, met Tuesday
with the sister of American journalist Terry Anderson for a private
conversation about Carton's three years as a hostage.
   Carton, 64, was protocol officer at the French Embassy in Beirut
when he was kidnapped March 22, 1985 by pro-Iranian extremists. He
was freed May 4 along with French diplomat Marcel Fontaine, 45, and
French journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44.
   Peggy Say, of Batavia, N.Y., has been waging a campaign to keep
the hostage issue in the public eye as part of an effort to win the
release of her brother, the longest-held hostage in Lebanon.
   Anderson, 40, is the chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Mrs. Say met on Monday with Fontaine and hoped to see Kauffmann
on Wednesday.
   ``My feelings are mixed because it is always difficult,
especially hearing the stories of how the French were brutalized,''
she said. ``But on the other hand, Terry is alive and it has
reinforced my determination to work toward his release.
   ``I know I am doing what he is counting on me to do.''
   Carton said he felt well, but that his condition was weak and he
still has trouble walking. He met with Mrs. Say in the garden of
the home of his daughter in this Geneva suburb.
   ``I was encouraged that he seemed in reasonably good health,''
Mrs. Say said. ``He was very concerned about the hostages left
behind, so we agreed that our conversation be kept absolutely
private.''
   Referring to her talks with Carton and other members of his
family, she said:
   ``He, like Fontaine, was adamant that public pressure to get the
U.S. administration to work for the hostages' release was the only
way that they would ever gain freedom _ that their cause must be
kept in the public eye, that by keeping the issue alive, we are
keeping the hostages alive.''
   There are 18 hostages in Lebanon, including eight other
Americans in addition to Anderson.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II sipped two cups of tea
made from coca leaves to help ward off altitude sickness in this
sky-high city, a bishop said Tuesday.
   The pontiff, who arrived Monday night, was given ``mate de
coca'', or coca tea, aboard the Bolivian Boeing 727 that brought
him here from Uruguay, said Monsignor Julio Terraza, president of
the local Episcopal conference.
   ``He drank it again before he went to bed,'' Terrazas said. ``He
asked for it. It helps.''
   Coca leaves are used to make cocaine, which is illegal in
Bolivia. It is legal, however, to chew or brew the leaves, which
provide a mild stimulus. The leaves are considered an effective
folk remedy for altitude sickness.
   Bolivia has a flourishing cocaine industry despite government
efforts to stop it.
   Local officials said the pope, an alpine skier, had help up well
under the altitude. La Paz, at 11,930 feet above sea level, is the
highest capital in the world and many tourists are stricken with
dizziness, sleeplessness and headaches.
   On Tuesday, the pontiff gave a mass in a city suburb called ``el
alto'' (the heights), 13,150 feet above sea level.
   Asked if the pope had been affected by the altitude, Terrazas
said: ``Yes, a little bit, it seems. But it passed without any
problems.''
   Juan Asbun, a prominent physician hired by the local church to
look after the pope, said: ``The pope is in perfect health.''
   ``He has tolerated the altitude well,'' Asbun said. ``He hasn't
needed oxygen, and slept six hours perfectly well.''
   When the pope arrived Monday night, a government-contracted
doctor, Rolando Mercado, was standing by at the airport with eight
tanks of oxygen in the event they were needed by John Paul or
members of his entourage.
   ``A lot of emotion takes away oxygen and can lead to
dizziness,'' Mercado said.

   A NASA engineer said Tuesday that a recent
test firing of a full-size booster rocket was the best so far in
qualifying the redesigned rockets for the first post-Challenger
space shuttle flight.
   Royce Mitchell, project manager of the booster program at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the April 20
test showed nothing that would stand in the way of the flight
scheduled for August.
   The rockets must pass two more full-duration firings, one in
June and one in July, before they receive final certification. The
boosters, built by Morton Thiokol Inc., are tested at that
company's plant in Utah.
   A faulty Morton Thiokol booster rocket was blamed for the
January 1986 disaster in which the Challenger was destroyed and its
crew of seven killed.
   Mitchell spoke at a news conference from Huntsville that was
carried by television to National Aeronautics and Space
Administration centers around the country and to the agency's
headquarters in Washington.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court has ruled a Roman Catholic high school
may keep an honors student who became pregnant and was married from
attending her prom and graduation.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Anthony Scotillo on Monday said Unity
Catholic High School was reasonably enforcing its policy and was
causing no irreparable harm.
   Scotillo denied a request for a temporary restraining order from
Carla Minniefield Jenkins, 18.
   ``I feel discriminated against,'' Mrs. Jenkins said. ``I told
them I was pregnant in January. I participated in senior
activities, but they didn't tell me until March 31 that if you're
pregnant your senior year you cannot go to graduation.''
   Principal Lawrence Keller said she would be allowed to graduate,
but would receive her diploma at home.
   ``Our goal is to support her in going to full term in her
pregnancy,'' Keller said. ``But we decided that we could not
condone premarital sex or teen-age marriage. It's as simple as
that.''
   Mrs. Jenkins, who is five months pregnant, was married last
month to Richard Jenkins, 19. His father, attorney Robert Jenkins,
filed the court request.
   ``I can understand them not condoning premarital sex, but some
time we're going to have to learn to live with the good and the
bad,'' the elder Jenkins said.
   In the South Side school's 66-year history, officials have never
knowingly allowed a pregnant student to participate in the
graduation program, Keller said.

<TEXT>
   A malnourished 7-year-old boy who escaped after
spending up to four years in a bathroom prison has gone to a foster
home carrying dozens of gifts from well-wishers, authorities said.
   Ben Taub Hospital's doctors decided that 25-pound Vannoy Jimenez
needed ``privacy, some love and some food and a good diet'' more
than additional hospital treatment, said Judy Hay, spokeswoman for
the Harris County Protective Services.
   The boy, who apparently has received no schooling and had only
two dogs for companions in his family's locked bathroom, received
so many toys and stuffed bears there wasn't room for him in his
hospital bed, she said.
   Ms. Hay said the boy was told he would be going to a new family
where he could play with other children.
   ``He was very excited,'' she said Monday. ``He wanted to get a
haircut and meet his foster parents.''
   The child will live with a couple who has provided a home for 65
children over 14 years, working especially well with emotionally
disturbed children, Ms. Hay said.
   Vannoy's plight came to light last week when he climbed out a
window in the bathroom of his parents' apartment and wandered to a
service station.
   His parents _ Alexander Lizcano Jimenez, 38, and Charlotte Anne
Bishop, 42 _ were charged with injury to a child by omission. They
remain in the Harris County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bond each.
   Authorities have not been able to determine how long Vannoy was
locked in the bathroom, but he had been severely abused for at
least four years, Ms. Hay said.

<TEXT>
   A time bomb hidden in a briefcase
exploded in the foreign-exchange area of New Delhi's main Citibank
branch Tuesday, killing one person and wounding 14, police reported.
   The midday explosion blew out most of the American bank's
windows and caused extensive damage to the floor, ceiling and
furniture. Shards of smoke-colored window glass, and pieces of
human flesh, littered the sidewalk.
   No one claimed responsibility. The U.S. Embassy issued a warning
to American citizens in the Indian capital.
   All the victims were Indians and two of the wounded were in
serious condition, officials said. The dead man was identified as
Satish Chaudhry, 40, of Noida, a town east of New Delhi.
   Citibank's New Delhi headquarters office opened late last year
on the third floor of a new, 12-story office building in downtown
New Delhi owned by the Life Insurance Corp. of India. The red
sandstone structure overlooks the Connaught Circle shopping arcade.
   Dr. Saroj Sharma of Ram Manohar Hospital said most of the
injured suffered cuts and leg injuries.
   Maryann Whitten, an embassy spokeswoman, said: ``The American
Embassy has advised its employees and American businesses in New
Delhi to take security precautions.'' She did not elaborate.
   Police Commissioner Vijay Karan told a news conference: ``We do
not rule out the hands of foreign terrorist organizations. We are
reviewing security arrangements for all U.S. agencies and
individuals.''
   Karan said the bomb, apparently hidden in a fiberglass
briefcase, was similar to one that exploded in a staircase leading
to the Bank of America office in downtown New Delhi in August 1986.
No one was injured in that bombing.
   He said Sikhs would not have planted the bomb because ``they do
not use such devices.'' Sikh extremists have fought for an
independent homeland in the northern state of Punjab for more than
five years, and thousands of people have been killed.
   A bomb threat was telephoned to another Citibank branch at about
3:30 p.m. but the telephone call was a hoax, Karan said.
   Officers of the Citibank employees' union criticized bank
security.
   K.L. Malhotra, union president, was quoted by the United News of
India agency as saying the bank hired contract guards rather than
employing its own.
   He claimed that ``contravenes Delhi police guidelines for
strengthening security at all bank branches.''
   The explosion tore a hole two inches deep and 18 inches in
diameter in the bank's pink marble floor.
   A witness, who asked that his name not be used, said the bank
was crowded with people waiting in line for tellers.
   It appeared that comparatively little damage was done outside
the Citibank office. Nearly all windows on other floors remained
intact.
   David Roberts, a Citibank vice president and corporate officer
for India, said five of the wounded were bank employees.
   He said the ``branch was damaged quite extensively, but we
expect to be back in operation within 48 hours.''
   Roberts said the bank is a branch of Citibank in India, a
subsidiary of the New York banking company.

   Oregon's traditional unkindness to
front-runners could give Michael Dukakis pause and Jesse Jackson
encouragement as they head west for the next primary on the long
campaign trail.
   Both Democrats will be campaigning in Oregon this week, seeking
a share of the 45 national convention delegates at stake next
Tuesday and also hoping to gain momentum for the primary season's
big finale in neighboring California.
   Vice President George Bush also will be in the state this
weekend, even though he has sewn up the Republican nomination.
There are 32 GOP delegates at stake in Oregon.
   A statewide poll in mid-April showed Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis,
the national front-runner, as the favorite among Oregon Democrats.
He had support from 48 percent compared to 28 percent for Jackson.
   But Portland pollster Tim Hibbitts has said that even if Jackson
receives only 25 percent to 30 percent of the vote in the primary,
it would be a good showing for a black candidate in a state that's
less than 2 percent black.
   If history is any guide, Oregon shouldn't be taken for granted
by anyone.
   ``A number of candidates have had the wheels taken off their
bandwagon when they got to Oregon,'' said state Sen. Grattan
Kerans, a Eugene Democrat who's a consultant for the Dukakis
campaign.
   Oregon voters in the 1984 Democratic primary handed a lopsided
victory to Gary Hart even though Walter Mondale was the established
front-runner nationally. Hart went on to win in California, though
Mondale eventually won the Democratic nomination.
   Indeed, Oregon Democrats in four of the past nine presidential
primaries have given victories to presidential candidates who
failed to win their party's nomination.
   ``Oregon has been described as a maverick state, and that's
probably true,'' Kerans said. ``You have people who are removed
geographically from political power centers, and they look at
things from their own perspective.''
   Jackson, beginning a three-day Oregon swing on Tuesday, is the
first presidential candidate to visit the state this year, but
Dukakis is planning stops on Thursday and possibly Saturday.
   The Jackson camp in particular views Oregon's primary as
important because it directly precedes the June 7 California
primary. A good showing by Jackson in a heavily white, Western
state would show that he has broad appeal and would give him a big
boost right before California, a campaign aide said.
   ``If the people in California see Jesse do well in Oregon, we
hope they will take their cue from that,'' said John Norris, a
national field coordinator for Jackson. ``We're spending a lot of
time here to send a message to the other Western states.''
   During their visits to Oregon, Jackson and Dukakis plan to spend
much of their time in the Portland area. Jackson also has events in
Redmond, the Willamette Valley and southern Oregon.
   In addition to Portland appearances Thursday, Dukakis plans to
travel to Medford and tentatively plans to take part in events in
Eugene and Washington County, Oregon's suburban high-tech center,
on Saturday.
   Bush is to campaign in Portland on Friday and in Washington
County and Medford on Saturday.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Board of Pardons and Paroles is
reviewing the case of Wayne Williams, convicted of two murders in a
series of killings of young black people, in preparation for his
first parole hearing.
   Board spokesman Silas Moore said the five-member board received
the file this week, and would announce its decision in early June.
   Williams, 29, was convicted Feb. 27, 1982, of murdering two of
29 young blacks who were killed in Atlanta from 1979 to 1981. He
was sentenced to life in prison. Police later blamed him for an
additional 22 slayings, although he was not charged in them.
   Under Georgia law, all inmates serving life sentences must be
considered for parole after seven years in prison. It is unlikely
Williams will be released, said parole board member Michael Wing.
   ``With any multiple murder case, it would be almost
inconceivable that they would be paroled after the seven-year
mark,'' he said. ``In most instances, that would put serious
consideration (for parole) a long way off in the future.''
   Lynn Whatley of Atlanta, one of Williams' attorneys, said
Williams' hope for freedom is based on a successful appeal of his
convictions, not parole. The appeal is pending in Butts County,
where Williams is an inmate at the Georgia Diagnostic and
Classification Center.

   A jury today acquitted reputed mob boss
Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and eight associates on all
charges in the 1984 slaying of gang rival Salvatore Testa.
   Scarfo raised his right hand in a near salute and grinned at the
jury as it returned the verdicts. Spectators in the packed
courtroom cheered and shouted.
   Scarfo, 59, and the other eight defendants were being tried for
the Sept. 14, 1984, murder of Testa. His body, with two bullets in
the head, was found trussed and wrapped in a blanket in southern
New Jersey woods.
   Scarfo faces charges in two other murders. He was convicted last
year of conspiring with a former city councilman to extort $1
million from a waterfront developer. He is serving 14 years in
prison on that conviction.
   When forewoman Ollie Minze said, ``Not guilty,'' to the charge
of conspiracy involving defendant Joseph Grande, the courtroom
erupted with a roar and some cheered. Common Pleas Judge Albert
Sabo warned that if the outburst continued he would clear the
courtroom.
   The crowd quieted after Scarfo's lawyer, Robert Simone,
cautioned ``It's not over yet'' and Ms. Minze resumed reading the
verdict.
   On all counts _ first-degree murder, conspiracy and possession
of an instrument of a crime _ she said, ``Not guilty.''
   Assistant District Attorney Barbara Christie, who had prosecuted
the two-month trial, asked that the jury be polled. As the name of
each defendant was called, and on each count, jurors affirmed the
verdicts.
   When that was completed, the defendants stood and embraced their
lawyers, and waved happily to their families and the jury as the
eight women and four men who considered their fate left the
courtroom.
   ``I love the American judicial system,'' Scarfo's son, Nicodemo
Jr., told a reporter outside the courtroom. The younger Scarfo had
been in the second-floor City Hall courtroom since the trial began
in March.
   Police allege that the elder Scarfo ran the
Philadelphia-southern New Jersey Mafia family from his home in
Atlantic City, N.J., before his arrest in the unrelated extortion
case in 1986.
   Besides Scarfo, the defendants were his nephew, Philip Leonetti
of Margate, N.J., identified during the trial as the mob's
underboss; Salvatore Merlino of Ventnor, N.J.; and Philadelphians
Salvatore ``Wayne'' Grande, Joseph Pungitore, Francis Iannarella,
Salvatore Scafidi, Joseph Grande and Charles Iannece.
   The jury got the case Monday after arguments from Simone, who
attacked two former gangsters who were key prosecution witnesses,
and from Ms. Christie, who conceded that the informants, Nicholas
``Nicky Crow'' Caramandi and Thomas DelGiorno, were despicable and
talked only after they were marked for death.
   Outside the courtroom today, Simone said it was the second trial
in a row in which the defense beat prosecutors who used Caramandi
and DelGiorno. The two also also were the star prosecution
witnesses when Scarfo and four associates were acquitted in
December of 20 federal drug charges.
   ``This is the second time that a jury didn't listen to the lies
of Caramandi and DelGiorno,'' Simone said. ``It is a signal to the
whole country that you just don't persecute people because of their
alleged associations and activities. If they come at us again, we
will hit them even harder.''
   Ms. Christie left the courtroom after the verdict, avoiding
reporters.
   The informants testified that Scarfo gave the order to kill
Testa because Testa was threatening Scarfo's control of the mob and
because Testa broke his engagement to the daughter of one of
Scarfo's top lieutenants.
   Caramandi and DelGiorno testified Testa was murdered in a closed
south Philadelphia candy store. Caramandi said Testa was lured by
his best friend, Pungitore, to the store, where Salvatore Grande
pumped two bullets into Testa's head. The two witnesses said
Testa's body was transported in a van to New Jersey, where it was
dumped along a road.

   The House on Tuesday created a four-member
committee to investigate a fire last week in Speaker Jim Wright's
congressional office, and study fire safety in the Capitol and
three House office buildings.
   Established by voice vote, the committee was proposed by Rep.
Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a former volunteer fireman who attempted
unsuccessfully to extinguish the May 5 fire in the Longworth House
Office Building.
   No one was injured in the fire, which was put out by the
District of Columbia Fire Department.
   Weldon said he discovered while fighting the fire that the
building had no automatic fire alarm or sprinkler system, that
elevators did not automatically go to the basement, and that
stairwells were not enclosed to prevent toxic smoke from entering.
   ``We met with complete frustration,'' said Weldon, whose office
is near the district office of Wright, D-Texas. ``No building,
seven stories high with 2,000 people inhabiting it, could be
allowed to be without an automatic alarm and sprinkler system.''
   He said efforts are under way to upgrade fire protection but may
not be completed for months.
   The committee is to study fire safety conditions at the Capitol
as well as the Longworth, Rayburn and Cannon office buildings.
   Congressional buildings are not required to comply with any
federal, state, or District of Columbia fire codes.
   The committee is to consist of two Democratic and two Republican
members, who have not yet been named.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis battled
Jesse Jackson in West Virginia and Nebraska on Tuesday in
low-intensity primary skirmishes along the way to a final showdown
next month in California.
   Dukakis was heavily favored to capture both contests and a
majority of the 62 delegates at stake, thus reinforcing the
impression that he is the Democratic nominee in all but name.
   Neither primary generated much excitement, in part because there
seemed little suspense about the outcome but also because hotly
contested statewide races overshadowed the presidential contest.
   Vice President George Bush was the Republican winner in advance
on primary ballots in both states _ as usual. The vice president,
who has clinched the GOP nomination and has no active opposition in
the remaining primary states, looked forward to receiving the
endorsement of President Reagan on Wednesday.
   Dukakis, in contrast, was several hundred delegates ahead of
Jackson but several hundred shy of the total needed to claim the
Democratic nomination. Aides expressed confidence he would command
a nominating majority by the time the primary season ends on June 7
with elections in California, New Jersey and two other states, and
Dukakis has begun campaigning with one eye on Jackson and the other
on the fall campaign against Bush.
   The Massachusetts governor had 1,522 delegates, to 935 for
Jackson. It takes 2,081 to claim the nomination.
   The week's Democratic primaries offered a breather in the
schedule after a rapid-fire series of industrial state contests
ending last week in Indiana and Ohio and pointing the way toward
contests in Oregon next week and California in early June.
   Neither Democratic contender spent much time or devoted much
advertising money to Nebraska and West Virginia _ and their
campaigns were overshadowed by fierce gubernatorial and senatorial
primaries.
   In West Virginia, incumbent Republican Gov. Arch Moore faced a
stiff primary challenge from John Raese, while Democrats picked an
opponent to run against the survivor.
   Nebraska Republicans chose between appointed Sen. David Karnes
and Rep. Hal Daub for the Senate nomination. Former Gov. Robert
Kerrey sought the Democratic nomination to oppose the winner.
   Neither Dukakis nor Jackson seemed to mind that the presidential
race was at a pause. The Massachusetts governor, the nomination
seemingly within his grasp, took a weekend off for the first time
in months.
   Jackson devoted part of his week to campaigning in California,
where he plans a costly and intensive effort to slow Dukakis' drive
toward the nomination.
   Over the last six weeks, Dukakis has put together an impressive
series of primary vitories in Connecticut, Wisconsin, New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, forcing all his rivals but one from
the race and leaving Jackson far behind in the hunt for delegates.
   At the same time, party leaders have begun to swing behind
Dukakis and treat him as the nominee-in-waiting, but also hope to
avoid antagonizing Jackson and the millions of black voters who
sustained his candidacy.

   A federal investigation concluded today that
the crew's failure to follow a required preflight check list caused
the crash last August of a Northwest Airlines jet during takeoff at
Detroit.
   A total of 156 people were killed in the crash, the nation's
second worst commercial aviation accident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said that the crew of
Northwest flight 255 did not properly set the McDonnell Douglas
MD-80's flaps and slats to give the plane adequate lift for
takeoff. The devices were not set because the crew did not follow
required checklist procedures as the plane prepared for takeoff,
the board said.
   The finding immediately was criticized by the Air Line Pilots
Association, which promised to conduct further investigations into
the Aug. 16, l987, accident.
   ``They (NTSB investigators) fell short,'' Steven Kramer, a union
member and Northwest pilot who took part in the investigation, told
reporters after the NTSB's official probable cause was approved.
Kramer was one of the union's representatives in the investigation.
   The pilots group has maintained that it is possible a mechanical
problem could have caused the flaps and slats to be in improper
positions.
   The safety board also cited as a contributing factor to the
accident the failure of an alarm system to warn the crew that the
plane was not configured properly for takeoff.
   Investigators have said that the alarm did not sound because it
was not receiving electrical power, but the board concluded ``the
reason for the absence of electrical power could not be
determined.''
   Earlier in the day, NTSB investigators had told the board that
they had discovered a small amount of tarnish on the circuit
breaker, but not enough to interfere with the flow of electricity.
They also had no evidence of a voltage surge that might have popped
the breaker or any conclusive evidence that it might have been
intentionally pulled by either the flight crew or maintenance
workers.
   One investigator, William Laynor, said, ``The evidence, we felt,
was overwhelming ... that the aircraft did indeed attempt to take
off with the flaps retracted.''
   The board's hearing began with a dramatic computerized graphic
simulation of the Aug. 16 crash.
   The simulation, in the form of a 16-minute videotape, traces the
plane's taxiing as it prepared to leave the airport. The exchanges
between the pilot and airport tower could be heard; conversation
inside the cockpit was graphically superimposed on the television
screen.
   The simulation showed that almost immediately after the
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 lifted off from the runway it began to have
problems, dipping first to the left, then the right, then left and
right again while at the same time veering away from the runway.
   In a sequence that took only seconds, the plane finally dipped
sharply to the left and almost rolled over, hitting a light post
and than part of a building before crashing onto a highway.
   ``I've got a crash on the airport. Airport's closed,'' a
controller could be heard saying.
   The pilot of flight 255 was Capt. John R. Maus, 57, of Las
Vegas. The copilot was David J. Dodds, 35, of Galena, Ill.
   Since the crash, pilot groups, the airline and the plane's
manufacturer have offered sharply different versions of what they
believe went wrong.
   But the central issues of the accident have been known for
months.
   Examination of the data recorder showed that the plane's wing
flaps were fully retracted when they should have been extended 11
degrees. The slats in the front part of the wing also were
retracted.
   Such a configuration of the wing's control surfaces sharply
inhibited the twin-engine jet's ability to gain lift. The plane
rose no more than 50 feet off the ground.
   McDonnell Douglas argued that the pilot and copilot were to
blame because of a ``casual attitude'' during a preflight checklist
and their alleged failure to set the flaps properly. The
manufacturer also accused the crew of pulling a circuit breaker to
the alarm system so that it would not go off. No specific evidence
supporting that allegation has been produced.
   Northwest blamed the failure of the flap warning system and
maintained there was evidence that the breaker had been
``tarnished'' so as not to give an alarm. McDonnell Douglas
acknowledges that some tarnish was found on the breaker, but
contends that did not keep it from sounding.
   The pilots union, to which both of the pilots belonged, pointed
to previous problems with the flap mechanism on the plane.
   In any case, the pilots union rejected suggestions that the
warning system was disabled by the flight crew and suggested _ as
did Northwest Airlines _ that a flaw in the circuit breaker
prevented the alarm from sounding.
   The crash was the second worst commercial aviation accident in
U.S. history, ranking behind only the May 1979 crash of an American
Airlines jet in Chicago that killed 275.

   Dukakis spent scant time campaigning in either state, devoting
less than 24 hours combined to West Virginia and Nebraska. Aides
said his campaign spent less than $50,000 on television advertising
in the two states.
   The Massachusetts governor took shots at Bush over the issue of
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, under indictment in the United
States for drug activities, and collected a stream of endorsements
from Democratic Party leaders.
   He won the support of seven governors during the week as he
pushed his delegate advantage over Jackson to nearly 600.
   But Dukakis also spent considerable time dealing with his
state's looming budget crunch _ a test of his campaign claim that
he is a forceful leader who is not afraid to make tough decisions.
   Jackson spent parts of two days in West Virginia and parts of
three in Nebraska, but his advisers conceded they had little hope
of derailing Dukakis in either state.
   Instead, Jackson spent part of the past week in California, his
last plausible chance to slow Dukakis, and directed less fire
toward his Demnocratic rival and more toward Bush.
   When the vice president referred to Jackson as a ``hustler from
Chicago'' _ a phrase that his aides said was meant to praise
Jackson for working hard _ Jackson shot back that Bush had
``started to panic.''
   ``Vice President Bush has begun to call me names,'' he said.
``He's trapped in an unholy triangle between the Ayatollah, Noriega
and Meese,'' he said, referring to Iranian Leader Ayatollah
Khomeini and the Iran-Contra affair, questions about Noriega's drug
activities and the legal difficulties surrounding Attorney General
Edwin Meese III.
   Increasingly, Jackson portrayed himself as an insurgent
candidate running against the combined forces of Dukakis,
Democratic leaders and the pundits.
   He appealed to party officials who will attend the Democratic
National Convention as delegates to wait until the primary campaign
ends before swinging behind a candidate.
   At one point he suggested his supporters might or might not work
hard for the Democratic ticket this fall depending on how he was
treated. But he later backed off, saying, ``We need not speak in
terms of a fight.''
   Bush spent little time campaigning in Nebraska or West Virginia,
alothough he toured several western states in a week in which he
often seemed to be on the defensive.
   His comment about Jackson aside, Bush awoke one morning to
discover two senior aides being quoted in a newsoaper story as
calling Meese a political liability.
   ``I must say I am troubled by some of the allegations'' (against
the attorney general), Bush told reporters, although he said he
hadn't authorized either of his aides to speak out.
   Asked if he viewed Meese as an albatross on his campaign, Bush
replied, ``An albatross? I don't think so.''
   Bush, who headed a drug interdiction task force earlier in the
Reagan administration, also was confronted with fresh questions
about when he learned of Noriega's alleged drug activities.
   The vice president says he lacked clear knowledge of Noriega's
alleged drug involvement before the indictment three months ago.
His spokesman, Pete Teeley, says Bush was aware of allegations but
regarded them as unsubstantiated.

   National Guardsmen patrolled for looters today in a Kentucky
city blasted by powerful winds that killed one woman and injured at
least 15 people in a wave of violent storms that pounded sections
of the Midwest, Northeast and South.
   The storms spawned by a cold front Monday flipped airplanes in
Cleveland, knocked out power to thousands in Michigan and unleashed
hail as big as baseballs in Texas.
   ``It's a disaster, just a disaster,'' said Middlesboro, Ky.,
Mayor Troy Welch, estimating damage to his city in the millions.
The storm destroyed a radio newsroom, tore roofs off buildings,
blew furniture into the street and knocked out all power to the
town.
   Welch declared an emergency, and Gov. Wallace Wilkinson
activated 30 National Guardsmen to help clean up and keep the peace
in the city of 11,000 residents near the Cumberland Gap just north
of the Tennessee border.
   Sgt. Jeff Sharpe of the Middlesboro Police Department said that
no arrests for looting had been made despite previous official
reports to that effect.
   The thunderstorms that lashed the Ohio Valley on Monday weakened
considerably by early today, with just scattered showers and
thunderstorms remaining from Virginia to New York. But strong
thunderstorms continued over sections of Louisiana, Texas,
Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama.
   In Middlesboro, the winds smashed a trailer, killing a woman and
injuring her husband and child, police Sgt. Jimmy England said.
   Many people were injured and there was an unconfirmed report
that one person was missing, state police said. Fifteen people were
treated at Middlesboro Appalachian Regional Hospital, said
assistant administrator Dan Fitzpatrick.
   Helicopters carrying injured to the University of Tennessee
Medical Center in Knoxville 45 miles to the south had to turn back
because of the bad weather, said a nursing supervisor who refused
to give her name.
   The storm hit at 10:15 p.m. Monday, just as news director Jim
Gilbert of radio station WFXY was getting ready to broadcast a
warning about heavy thunderstorms.
   ``We were sitting there and the wind started to blow really hard
and it (the station) exploded,'' Gilbert said. ``It wiped my
newsroom out. ... We have nothing. We're gone. My typewriter's
gone. I can't even find it.''
   The wind blew roofs off downtown buildings, shattered windows,
tore doors of hinges at the hospital and leveled a furniture store
built in 1890, officials said.
   ``There's furniture all over the street,'' Welch said.
   At the Middlesboro Airport, 20 small planes were damaged, along
with fuel pumps, said Don Armstrong of the state Division of
Disaster and Emergency Services in Frankfort.
   All power was knocked out, and crews were working today to
restore it, said Jack Cook, safety coordinator for Kentucky
Utilities.
   Three emergency shelters were set up to give people left
homeless a place to stay for the night, but fewer than a dozen
showed up, Armstrong said.
   The National Weather Service said it could not confirm whether a
tornado had hit Middlesboro.
   Tornadoes were reported in northeast and southwest sections of
Ohio, with winds up to 70 mph recorded, but the weather service
said it could not confirm the twisters.
   Six small planes, five of them tied down, were lifted into the
air and damaged at Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland, said Larry
Rohl, owner of T&G Flying Club Inc. Rohl pegged the loss to the
club at $125,000.
   In the southwest Ohio city of Oxford, Ray Moloney saw his picnic
table lift off the ground in his back yard, spin like a helicopter,
then come to rest 15 feet away.
   ``I didn't see a funnel, all I saw was the whirling,'' said
Moloney. ``I don't know how long it lasted, maybe a minute. Then
there was some hard hail for a minute. Then it was gone.''
   The storm downed trees and utility lines in many parts of Ohio.
   In Michigan's Lower Peninsula, about 1,400 people remained
without power today, utility officials said. On Monday, 41,000
homes were without electricity.
   Trees and power lines also fell in Pratt City, Ala., the weather
service said.
   Hail fell in Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee, Alabama,
Arkansas and Texas. In Freestone County in eastern Texas, large
hail damaged cars, the service said.

<HEAD>Unauthorized U.S. Stinger Missiles Show Up in Qatar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is trying to find out how
several of its Stinger anti-aircraft missiles wound up in the tiny
Persian Gulf state of Qatar, a top U.S. official said Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy said the highly
accurate, shoulder-fired rockets may have been passed to Qatar by
Iran, which in turn obtained them from the U.S.-supplied Afghan
rebels.
   Murphy told a congressional hearing that the United States was
seeking to get the missiles back and check their serial numbers
against a list of Stingers supplied overseas.
   Speaking later to reporters, Murphy said the ``handful'' of
Stingers had shown up about a month ago in a military parade in
Qatar. He said the Qataris had yet to agree to a U.S. request to
see the missiles. ``We want to know how they got them,'' he said.
   Murphy said the United States could not control ``black market
leakages'' of weapons around the world, despite a provision in its
Stinger contracts with other governments which forbids transfer of
the missiles to a third party.
   Murphy noted that the Stingers were considered an ``ideal
terrorist's weapon'' because they are easy to carry, store and use.
He also pointed to congressional sensitivity on the Stinger sales.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., asked Murphy how the United States can
keep track of the Stingers despite its detailed inventories when
the weapons are used by Afghan rebels against Soviet forces or
Chadian troops fighting Libya.
   Murphy conceded that Iran last year seized a shipment of
Stingers sent to the Mujahedeen rebels in Afghanistan. Fragments of
Stingers were found on an Iranian speedboat that attacked U.S.
helicopters in the Persian Gulf last fall.
   Following that incident, Congress sought to prevent
proliferation of the Stingers by banning future U.S. sales of the
rocket. But it made an exception for Bahrain, a neighbor of
Qatar's, to lease that country 70 Stingers for 18 months as a
defensive weapon against possible attacks by Iran.

<HEAD>Iceland Gets A Legal Brew, Must Wait 10 Months to Buy It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Parliament voted Tuesday to
legalize beer after 73 years of prohibition, but Icelanders will
have to wait 10 more months before they can quaff a cold one.
   After a year-long debate, a full turnout of the upper house of
Iceland's Althing (Parliament) voted 13-8 to stamp out the last
vestiges of prohibition on the island and permit the sale of beer
with an alcoholic content above 2.25 percent.
   A dozen beer-lovers flashed victory signs outside the Althing
after the post-midnight vote, but there was little other public
rejoicing.
   The beer won't go on sale until March 1, and while no price has
been set, pro- and anti-prohibitionists both called for high
prices, fearing the change could encourage alcohol abuse.
   Former lawmaker Jon Magnusson, who supported legalization, said:
``It's very important that people realize that beer is just as
dangerous as other alcohol.''
   Left-wing Althing member Svavar Gestsson, who opposed
legalization, said: ``This is a very unfortunate step and a
dreadful experience for me both as a parent and a parliamentarian.''
   Beer, like other alcoholic drinks in Iceland, is expected to
come under strict controls _ available only in bars and restaurants
or state liquor stores which have a monopoly on retailing and close
early.
   The pro-beer lobby argued that legalization was inevitable,
given the bureaucratic tangle that prohibition has caused.
   Beer has always provoked ambivalent feelings among the 243,000
Icelanders. On the one hand, beer is banned, but on the other hand,
Iceland's national drink is a skull-bashing distillation called
``Black Death.''
   The islanders voted in a 1908 referendum for a ban on all
alcoholic drinks, although it didn't take effect until Jan. 1 1915.
   The ban was partially lifted after Spain refused to buy
Iceland's main export, fish, unless Iceland bought Spanish wines,
and in 1933, prohibition was repealed _ except for beer.
   A powerful temperance movement continued to block the suds, but
the first crack appeared in 1980. Businessman David Scheving
Thorsteinsson went to court demanding the same rights as airline
crews who were bringing in internationally approved allowances of
duty-free beer.
   Although Thorsteinsson lost, the publicity forced a change in
the rules to allow Icelanders arriving from abroad to bring in 12.2
pints of foreign alcoholic beer.
   This spurred local companies to brew their own alcoholic beers
for sale at Reykjavik's airport, one of the few in the world which
has a duty-free store for incoming travelers.
   The anti-prohibition lobby returned to the warpath, arguing that
it was unconstitutional that Icelanders who could afford foreign
travel were entitled to buy beer.
   When the latest bill entered Parliament, an opinion poll showed
64.3 percent in favor of legalization. When 16 doctors published
newspaper ads warning of the health hazards, 133 others riposted
with ads saying alcoholism couldn't get worse if people switched
from spirits to beer.
   The bill passed in the lower house on April 18 by a 23-17 vote
with two members absent.

<NOTE>EDs: New thruout with Reagan comment on pardons; Fitzwater
comment.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today he has not ruled
out pardons for Iran-Contra defendants Oliver L. North and John M.
Poindexter.
   Reagan replied ``no'' when asked during a picture-taking session
whether he had definitely ruled out the possibility of pardons for
the two former White House aides.
   Reagan did not elaborate on the one-word answer, but he said it
with unusual emphasis.
   Syndicated columnist Carl Rowan reported Monday after having
lunch with the president that Reagan has effectively ruled out
pardons before trial of any of the defendants in the Iran-Contra
case, and said the president will probably be out of office by the
time the case is decided.
   The president said he ``didn't believe in giving pardons before
people are convicted of anything,'' Rowan related, adding that
Reagan reasoned ``it leaves the cloud of guilt on through the
years.''
   Rowan reported on the president's comments during an interview
on WUSA-TV in Washington on Monday evening. The White House today
released an excerpt of Rowan's interview.
   It said that Reagan, replying to a question about pardons, said:
   ``You can't consider that, Carl, until this case has been
closed, whichever way it's going to go. To pardon somebody before
trial leaves a sense of guilt around them, a cloud of guilt for the
rest of time. And so this is something that I don't have to face.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked to reconcile
Rowan's report and the president's response today, said, ``I told
you, it wasn't definitive. ... It means there's been no decision.
... You got a `yes' and a `no', which means no definitive decision
has been made.''
   Earlier today, Fitzwater said he would not interpret Reagan's
comments.
   ``I have not talked to the president about it,'' Fitzwater said.
``I want to be fair to you. I think that there has not been a
definitive decision made on pardons, I don't believe.
   ``However, the language is here, it is plain and it did come
from the president,'' Fitzwater added. ``So you can interpret that
as good reporeters however you like but I simply cannot go beyond
it.''
   At issue is whether Reagan will consider either pretrial or
post-trial pardons of Poindexter, former national security adviser;
North, a former National Security Council staffer; retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner, Albert
Hakim.
   The four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert profits
from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   According to a transcript of a court hearing released Monday, a
compromise has been reached in the defense effort to review
ultra-sensitive government documents related to the case.
   Under the agreement, North, Poindexter and their lawyers will
review a small group of documents.
   Hakim, Secord and their lawyers will not see the documents. They
agreed in a hearing Friday to rely on the judgment of the lawyers
for Poindexter and North.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is allowing the defense to
review the material to verify prosecution claims that it is not
relevant to the charges.
   The defense concession does not dispose of the larger problem of
disclosing sensitive information that may be determined to be
relevant when the case goes to trial.
   Gesell issued an order Monday giving independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh until May 30 to draw up a list of secret
documents he wants to use as evidence that won't be declassified by
the government.

<HEAD>Reports of PLO Threats Against Americans in Wake of Wazier
Assassination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Reagan administration has received reports
that the Palestine Liberation Organization might target Americans
for attack because of alleged U.S. involvement in the murder of a
high-level PLO official, Congress was told Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy said the United
States had received such reports following last month's
assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's second-in-command, also
known as Abu Jihad. Israel is believed to have carried out that
assassination in Tunis.
   The reports ``were serious enough to not take a chance'' by
ignoring them, he told reporters following a congressional hearing.
``There was no specific target but the reports had plausibility
because of the Abu Jihad'' murder, he said.
   Specifically, the United States is concerned about the reports
because of accusations by the PLO that the United States knew about
and even approved Wazir's assassination, Murphy said.
   As a result, several American ambassadors in Arab countries were
asked to discuss the U.S. concerns verbally with authorities there,
Murphy said.
   ``There was no (U.S.) letter,'' Murphy said.
   One Arab government conveyed the U.S. concerns to the PLO ``and
(PLO Chairman Yasser) Arafat decided to go public with this,''
Murphy told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on arms control,
international security and science.
   Murphy denied Arafat's accusations that the United States had
made veiled threats to assassinate PLO leaders if the PLO attacked
U.S. targets.
   ``I assume you deny this?'' he was asked by Rep. Lawrence Smith,
D-Fla.
   ``Of course,'' Murphy responded.
   At the State Department, meanwhile, spokesman Charles Redman
said the administration had made contact with a number of Middle
Eastern countries as ``a prudent response to infomation available
to us concerning possible attacks.''
   He said Arafat's interpretation of the U.S. contacts was
``entirely without foundation.''
   Murphy did not name the Arab intermediary, but in the past the
United States has conveyed messages to the PLO through Tunisia,
where the PLO established its headquarters after being expelled by
Israel from Lebanon in 1982.
   The United States repeatedly has denied any involvement in the
commando raid on Abu Jihad's Tunis home. Deputy Secretary of State
John Whitehead said Monday he would stress this point in his talks
later this week with Tunisian leaders in Tunis.
   The State Department's top counterterrorism expert, L. Paul
Bremer, said in an interview two weeks ago that the United States
expects increased Palestinian terrorism in the wake of the Abu
Jihad assassination and the five-month Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

   The AFL-CIO is mounting a star-studded, $13
million TV ad campaign in an effort to keep up with changes in U.S.
society, combat declining membership and spread the union message.
   The commercials, making their debut Wednesday, feature actress
Tyne Daly of CBS' ``Cagney and Lacey'' and Howard Hesseman of ABC's
``Head of the Class,'' said AFL-CIO spokesman Nick DiMartino.
   ``Aside from the general image of unions in society, there's a
whole group of people _ young people _ who don't have any
information on what unions can do,'' said DiMartino, deputy
director of the AFL-CIO's Labor Institute for Public Affairs.
   The commercials will also feature rank-and-file union members
promoting the quality of union life.
   The idea grew out of an AFL-CIO report that said unions had
failed to keep up with changes in U.S. society, DiMartino said.
   Another commercial, slated to star Jack Lemmon, is in the works
for a fall release.
   The AFL-CIO is sponsoring a contest for members who want to
appear opposite the famed actor. To apply, union members must
submit a 25-word statement on ``what my union has done for me
recently.''

   Comedian George Burns has some advice for
couples working on their marriages: relax, don't do it.
   ``Don't work that hard at being married,'' Burns said, according
to the June issue of McCall's magazine. ``If you try to make a

   The 92-year-old comic speaks from experience; he was married for
38 years to his show business partner, Gracie Allen.
   ``Not only did I love Gracie, I was no place before I met her.
... We had a wonderful marriage,'' Burns said. ``I don't think
Gracie and I ever had an argument in all that time _ except maybe

<HEAD>Rocard: Popular, Pragmatic and Ambitious</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-France, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's new premier, Michel Rocard, is ambitious,
pragmatic, non-doctrinaire and one of the nation's most popular
politicians.
   Rocard was appointed Tuesday by President Francois Mitterrand to
lead the new government. The 57-year-old Rocard will now get a
chance to demonstrate whether the consistently high scores he gets
in public opinion polls are matched by talent.
   His way won't be easy.
   Rocard, a Socialist, will be trying to run a government
dominated by his party yet develop policies attractive to
centrists, whose support his administration needs. Meanwhile, he
will have to get along with Mitterrand, who has been his rival for
a decade.
   Rocard has run for president three times. For this election, he
had announced a year ago that he planned to run for the job, but
stepped aside when it became clear last month that Mitterrand was
going to be a candidate.
   ``Whatever happens,'' Rocard told a newspaper recently. ``I know
that one day I will go to the Elysee Palace,'' the seat of the
French presidency.
   For the moment, Rocard will have to be content with the Hotel
Matignon, the prime minister's office on the Left Bank of the Seine.
   A dark-eyed chain smoker with impish features, Rocard is far
better known at home than abroad. In the past year, however, he has
met with President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   Rocard has said France's foreign policy would remain unchanged
under the Socialists and that he would continue to assert the
country's special independent stance within the Atlantic alliance.
   He supports greater European and trans-Atlantic cooperation
through quiet consultations to discuss defense questions such as
the continuing presence of U.S. troops in Europe.
   Rocard believes that Europeans should assume a greater share of
the defense burden, but not under the threat of a withdrawal of
U.S. troops.
   On economic issues, Rocard has called himself a ``free
enterprise leftist,'' who believes in the welfare state.
   ``France needs to find a future,'' he said in a campaign speech,
to become a ``more dynamic France, a more just France, a more
convincing France.''
   He says the conservatives, who had been in power since 1986,
have been hasty in selling off state-owned companies to private
investors. A better policy, he has said, would be to allow these
companies to raise capital so that they could grow and create jobs.
   One of the greatest challenges facing the new premier is
France's 10.3 percent unemployment.
   Rocard says he believes in greater international cooperation in
coordinating the economies of the industrialized nations. He also
favors helping Third World nations ease their debt.
   Rocard was born in Courbevoie, a suburb west of Paris, the son
of a scientist who helped develop France's atomic bomb.
   After living in colonial Algeria, Rocard turned to the political
left. In the 1960s he was a student activist, using an alias
because at the same time he was working his way through the
country's elite professional schools, including the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration, a training ground for French politicians.
   After the left lost parliamentary elections in 1978, Rocard
worked to sustain and modernize the Socialist party. At a party
congress after the elections, he boosted morale with a stirring
speech that said Socialism was still viable.
   He then worked to get the party to reject Marxist terminology
and accept concepts such as the role of market forces in an
advanced economy.
   Increasingly influential in the party, Rocard was mentioned as a
possible choice for premier after Mitterrand won his first term in
1981. Instead, he was appointed minister of state for planning and
then minister of agriculture in 1983.
   Two years later, he resigned in a dramatic and well-publicized
falling out with Mitterrand.
   Rocard is a Protestant in a Roman Catholic nation, who enjoys
sailing and skiing. He and his wife have two children in their 20s.
   He is also the mayor of the working class town of Conflans St.
Honorine, northwest of Paris.

   Another top presidential adviser has unleashed
an account of his White House years, but scandal-hunters will have
to look elsewhere. Pierre Salinger has little but praise for John
F. Kennedy.
   Salinger, who was Kennedy's press secretary, says the slain
president was a ``special man'' who surrounded himself with
advisers who ``believed in each other'' and in a common mission.
   ``There was no barrier on the president's door,'' Salinger
writes in the June issue of McCall's magazine. ``Any of his dozen
principal staffers could see him when they wanted to. They didn't
need permission from a chief of staff to gain access.''
   Kennedy, says Salinger, ``was not a perfect man. ... For all his
loftiness of purpose, he did not take himself that seriously. He
had no great vision of himself as a political or intellectual
giant.''
   But Salinger, now with ABC News, says Kennedy learned from his
mistakes.
   One measure of Kennedy's growth in office will be revealed this
November, when private correspondence between Kennedy and Soviet
leader Nikita Krushchev is scheduled to be released, Salinger says.
   ``As one who has read most of them, I believe they will be a
stunning revelation of two leaders of confrontational powers
groping toward understanding,'' he writes.

<HEAD>Workers End Lenin Shipyard Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of workers ended their eight-day
strike without a settlement tonight, leaving the Lenin shipyard
carrying a cross and the Polish flag and led by Solidarity founder
Lech Walesa.
   Police stood back silently and let the workers pass as they
walked slowly and calmly out of the shipyard shortly after 8 p.m.
Many workers carried luggage and boxes.
   The workers were applauded by bystanders as they exited, and
some bystanders rushed forward and joined the workers' procession.
   Many of the workers had been in the shipyard since May 2, when
the strike for higher pay and union rights began.
   Earlier today, the strikers accepted a strike committee proposal
to end their work stoppage, a cameraman said, and a Solidarity
banner was taken off the front gate of the shipyard.
   Strike spokesman Adam Michnik read a workers' statement saying,
``We are leaving the shipyard not in triumph, but with raised
heads.''
   Just before the workers ended their strike, Gdansk Bishop
Tadeusz Goclowski called Gen. Jerzy Andrzejewski and demanded the
removal of the police blockade around the shipyard, saying the
workers were coming out, according to Michnik.
   Andrzejewski was commanding the security forces at the shipyard,
which has been surrounded by police since Thursday.
   Strike talks broke off Monday after strikers rejected a
management offer. Attempts by a church mediator to persuade
management to resume talks were proving unsuccessful, said Michnik.
   After the alleged detention and beating of two couriers in
Gdansk, strikers complained earlier today that it was becoming more
and more difficult to get food supplies from outside the shipyard.
   The shipyard work stoppage was the last strike in a string of
five that began April 25, the country's worst wave of labor unrest
since the 1981 martial law crackdown.
   ``I think we accomplished something. We gained general agreement
on the other side that we exist,'' said Piotr Konopka, an aide to
Walesa.
   Walesa said Monday he and hundreds of workers at the Lenin
shipyard were determined to hold out for their demands. ``We'll
win! We'll win!'' 700 strikers shouted during a rally at the
shipyard.
   Meanwhile, in Warsaw, opposition activists and workers reported
a strike starting Monday at the Ursus tractor factory on the
outskirts of the capital. But officials denied there was a strike
and the report could not be verified.
   Strikers at the Gdansk shipyard rejected a management offer of
pay raises and reinstatement of some fired activists because the
deal did not include a legally recognized chapter of Solidarity.
   The independent union, the first in the Soviet bloc, was
outlawed after martial law was declared Dec. 13, 1981.
   Poland's communist government never ruled out using force to end
the strike. A pre-dawn police raid last Thursday crushed a 10-day
strike by steel workers at Nowa Huta in southern Poland.

   A four-term congressman challenged Nebraska Sen. David Karnes
and a millionaire businessman tried to wrest the nomination from
West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore as voters settled hotly contested
Republican primaries Tuesday.
   Karnes faced Rep. Hal Daub after a bitter, divisive campaign,
with polls suggesting a close finish. The winner could expect a
tough fight in November against popular ex-Gov. Bob Kerrey, whose
only Democratic opponent was disbarred lawyer Ken Michaelis.
   Karnes, the nation's youngest senator at 39, was appointed to
the office 14 months ago, and the primary marked his first bid for
elective office.
   Moore, seeking a record fourth term, was opposed by John Raese,
who accused the incumbent of failing to deal with West Virginia's
financial problems.
   Seven Democrats sought the gubernatorial nomination, most
prominently former House of Delegates Speaker Clyde See and
Charleston insurance executive Gaston Caperton, who waged a war of
negative TV campaign ads.
   West Virginia also had a Senate primary, with Majority Leader
Robert C. Byrd seeking a sixth term and expected to dispatch a
Democratic challenger, moving company owner Bob Myers. In the GOP
primary, state Sen. Jay Wolfe faced welfare recipient Bernie
Lumbert.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Karnes was a political unknown when Republican Gov. Kay Orr
appointed him after Edward Zorinsky's death. Daub, 47, was one of
several GOP regulars who lobbied for the job, and he acknowledged
bitterness at being passed over despite having ``carried water for
the elephant for 20 years.''
   Daub mounted an aggressive campaign, referring to Karnes as ``my
appointed opponent'' and last week charging that he was a ``rubber
stamp'' for Mrs. Orr and President Reagan.
   Karnes, who said he wanted to run ``a class campaign,'' refused
to be drawn into name-calling, and Mrs. Orr said it was ``sad''
that Daub resorted to ``desperate'' tactics.
   An Omaha World-Herald poll taken the week before the primary
showed 41 percent preferred Karnes, 40 percent backed Daub and the
remainder were undecided. A Lincoln Journal poll found Daub leading
Karnes 42 percent to 41 percent, with 17 percent undecided. The
margins of error in the polls were 4 and 6.4 percentage points
respectively.
   The 44-year-old Kerrey has been a highly successful Democrat in
a state where 51 percent of registered voters are Republicans. A
Congressional Medal of Honor winner who lost part of a leg in
Vietnam, he was elected governor in 1982, carried on a widely
publicized romance with movie star Debra Winger, and chose not to
run for re-election in 1986.
   In West Virginia, Raese accused Moore of waging a ``rose
garden'' campaign, refusing to debate and relying on his office to
carry him through the election.
   Moore, 65, boasted of having cut taxes by $311 million in the
past four years, although he fought most of the cuts when they were
imposed by the Legislature. He also cited his accomplishments at
bringing business and 30,000 jobs to the state, although the number
of employed West Virginians has increased by just 5,700 since 1985.
   NBC broadcast a report Sunday in which former Mingo County
political boss Johnie Owens said that in 1972 Moore offered to pay
him $12,000 to include him on a list of recommended candidates. A
Moore spokesman called the report ``a piece of garbage.''
   The 38-year-old Raese, who has a reputation of a ``rich kid''
who loves fast boats and hard living, lost his first bid for office
in a 1984 Senate race to another millionaire, Jay Rockefeller.
   See, 46, criticized Caperton's refusal to sign a voluntary
campaign spending limit and cited a study that found a 25 percent
error rate in state claims processed by Caperton's insurance
company, the nation's 18th largest.
   Caperton, 48, defended his business achievements and accused See
of ``old-style politics'' and a dirty campaign full of
``distortion.''
   Byrd said that if he is re-elected and the Democrats retain
control of the Senate, he will give up the majority leader's job to
become Appropriations Committee chairman, hoping to steer more
federal dollars to West Virginia.
   The last senator defeated in a primary was Sen. Richard Stone, a
Florida Democrat who lost in a 1980 runoff to Bill Gunter. Gunter
was defeated that November by Republican Paula Hawkins.
   The last governor to lose in a primary was Gov. Edwin W.
Edwards, a Louisiana Democrat, who finished second to Charles E.
``Buddy'' Roemer III in a non-partisan primary last October. Rather
than go through with a runoff, Edwards withdrew from the race.
   In 1986, Gov. William J. Sheffield of Alaska lost the Democratic
primary to Stephen C. Cowper, who is now governor.

   The tale of the starstruck Reagans rolled across
the front pages of Europe this week, drawing jokes and jibes along
the way, and even surfaced on the floor of Britain's House of
Commons.
   ``I come under Libra, which is a very balanced sign,'' declared
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when asked by a lighthearted
fellow Conservative lawmaker whether she planned to move an
astrologer into her No. 10 Downing St. residence.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 62, was born Oct. 13, under Libra, the sign of
the scales.
   The allegations by former White House chief of staff Donald
Regan about the role the zodiac played in the Reagan White House
are giving Europe's cartoonists, punsters and humorists a lot of
fun.
   ``Advice on Star Wars from the Stars Themselves,'' headlined
West Germany's Frankfurt Rundschau newspaper.
   ``The star-spangled planner,'' sniped London's Independent.
   Le Monde, France's most prestigious paper, ran a cartoon asking
an astrologer: ``How come you didn't predict Regan's book?''
   Regan's book was preceeded by several other books and articles
by former close associates of the president, most notably a recent
book by ex-presidential spokesman Larry Speakes.
   In his book, Speakes said he made up quotes for the president
without checking them with Reagan.
   The issue of kiss-and-tell _ or ``spit-and-tell'' as London's
Guardian put it _ doesn't interest many Europeans. Many governments
bind employees to lifetime oaths of confidence that make such
revelations difficult.
   One family that has suffered the scourge is Britain's royals.
The family also imposes oaths of confidence, and in 1983 it
resorted to the unprecedented tactic of suing a former Buckingham
Palace kitchen worker and the tabloid Sun, which was serializing
his memoirs. The Sun settled out of court and scrapped the series.
   ``I understand what Nancy Reagan was doing ... my wife does the
same thing, but taking an opinion from an astrologer is one thing
and basing decision-making on him or her is quite another,'' said a
Greek parliamentarian, who declined to be named.
   Greek fortuneteller Fortoula, a 50-year veteran medium, claims
to have been consulted in her basement apartment near the
Parliament in Athens by ``several prime ministers and I don't know
how many cabinet ministers'' from Greece, Egypt and Lebanon during
her career.
   ``Why not? Politicians in government need the advice of all
sorts of people,'' she said.
   West Germany's Bild newspaper quoted Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher as saying he reads the horoscopes daily but
doesn't believe in them.
   ``It is interesting to learn what I supposedly face day by
day,'' he said.
   Defense Minister Manfred Woerner was quoted as saying:
``Astrology is very interesting, but personally I would rather
place my fate in the hands of our loving God.''
   Dutch astrologer Jacques Chandu said he frequently advises
politicians on party matters, but declined to name names. He said
Mrs. Reagan had given his trade a boost.
   But S. Schouten of Utrecht University's parapsychology
department said he doubted astrology played a role in Dutch
politics.
   Switzerland's conservative newspaper, Neue Zuercher Zeitung,
predicted the astrology story would haunt the Reagans the way Jimmy
Carter suffered from his story about confronting a giant killer
rabbit.
   London's left-of-center Guardian said it was glad ``there is one
date that not even Mrs. Reagan's astrologers can postpone. The date
of the next presidential election.''

<HEAD>US Official Voices Confidence That Treaty Differences Can Be
Cleared Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Reagan administration official voiced
confidence Tuesday that Secretary of State George P. Shultz would
be able to clear up differences over a missile-ban treaty with the
Soviet Union in a new round of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze.
   The differences over policing the accord against cheating
prompted Senate leaders on Monday to indefinitely postpone
ratification.
   ``These are very, very technical issues, and we've had the
problem of pursuing them at long distance through diplomatic
exchange, informal translations, things of that sort,'' the
official told reporters before Shultz boarded an Air Force jet for
two days of talks with Shevardnadze in Geneva.
   ``There may, in fact, be differences, but I am quite confident
that if you get all of the right people in the city, at the expert
level, with the ministers watching over the process, that we'll be
able to nail these things down,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   However, Shevardnadze said on his arrival in Geneva Tuesday that
he was ``not quite clear what the problems'' were. He said the
Soviets had answered questions raised by the United States about
monitoring the agreement to scrap all U.S. and Soviet missiles with
a range of 315 to 3,125 miles.
   ``Basically the verification problems regarding the INF treaty
have been resolved, I think,'' Shevardnadze said.
   The Soviet answers were delivered to the State Department Sunday
night by Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin and presented Monday to the
Senate Intelligence Committee, where they received a chilly
reception.
   Subsequently, Senate Democratic and Republican leaders decided
to postpone debate over ratification, which had been scheduled to
begin Wednesday.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader,
said the treaty would remain ``on the back burner'' until the
differences were resolved.
   ``We don't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat,'' he
said. ``This obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is
before the Senate takes up the treaty.''
   Byrd appealed to the Kremlin to take steps to end the dispute
holding up the treaty. ``The Soviets hold the key,'' he told the
Senate.
   There are nine technical issues in dispute. The two most
significant involve Soviet attempts to restrict U.S. inspection of
missile containers and the range of access for U.S. monitoring
personnel within designated areas.
   Even if Shultz and Shevardnadze resolve the differences in
Geneva, where they reached final agreement on the treaty last
November, it was not clear whether the Senate would be able _ or
willing _ to ratify the accord before President Reagan's visit to
Moscow starting May 29.
   Another dispute erupted, meanwhile, as the Soviets asserted a
right to inspect West German Pershing 1-A missiles that are stored
in the United States. The rockets have a range of 465 miles, within
the span of the treaty, and the nuclear warheads are owned by the
United States.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman called the Soviet
demand ``sopmething we find astonishing, that they should choose to
raise that issue.''
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Senate decision to postpone debate on the treaty ``is a prudent and
reasonable course of action.''
   ``There is unanimity between the administration and the
bipartisan Senate leadership that these problems should be
satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification,'' he
said. ``The administration has made clear to the Soviets the need
for an expeditious solution.''
   Fitzwater said ``we hope to resolve these issues quickly. We're
still of the view that it is possible to have the treaty ratified
prior to the Moscow summit.''
   Reagan had hoped in his fourth and probably final meeting with
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign a far more
significant treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear
weapons by 30 to 50 percent.
   The senior U.S. official who briefed reporters at the State
Department acknowledged that hope for such a pact had about run
out. The official said Reagan and Gorbachev would issue a joint
statement ``identifying in some way where we are'' on arms control
and other issues.
   The idea would be for the president who succeeds Reagan in
January to pick up from there.
   After an all-night flight, Shultz planned to hold two meetings
with Shevardnadze on Wednesday and two more on Thursday before
flying to Brussels on Friday to brief the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   U.S. and Soviet arms control experts will meet separately in
Geneva, under the supervision of Shultz and Shevardnadze.
   Of the non-nuclear issues on Shultz's agenda, the two likely to
get the most attention were human rights and southern Africa.
   Human rights issues to be discussed may include an effort to
form an opposition party in the Soviet Union, which has encountered
resistance from Soviet authorities.
   ``We regret that when Soviet citizens try to involve themselves
directly in democracy that they are harassed and arrrested,''
Redman said.
   On southern Africa, the United States has been attempting for
years to negotiate the withdrawal of more than 40,000 Cuban troops
from Angola as well as independence and black majority rule for
South African-controlled Namibia.
   One hopeful sign was an unprecedented meeting last week in
London involving officials from the United States, Angola, South
Africa and Cuba. U.S. officials have said the meeting left the
impression among some that there is a new political will among
parties to the conflicts to reach a settlement.

   A man was cited for possession of
turtle parts after authorities found butchered remains of a
threatened loggerhead turtle in his yard, officials said.
   Max Lora told police he was spearfishing Sunday when he saw the
turtle, became startled and shot it, said Hillsborough County
sheriff's Lt. Jim Kelley.
   Lora, 39, was arrested Monday after authorities, acting on an
anonymous tip, found parts of a 5- to 10-year-old turtle which
weighed 80 to 100 pounds in his back yard, officials said.
   Lora was cited for possession of turtle parts, a misdemeanor
which carries a top penalty of 60 days in jail and a $500 fine,
said Capt. Ron Christie of the Florida Marine Patrol.
   Federal officials also plan to charge Lora, according to Special
Agent Paul Raymond of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   The survival of loggerheads is jeopardized in part because of
development of the turtle's nesting grounds along Florida's coast.

<BYLINE>Brain Chemical Found to Stimulate Panic Attacks
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have identified a brain chemical that
causes panic attacks when injected into panic attack patients,
suggesting the substance may play a role in the disorder that
afflicts 1.2 million Americans.
   All 11 panic attack patients given cholecystokinin intravenously
suffered attacks, beginning an average of 20 seconds after the
injection, said Jacques Bradwejn of McGill University in Montreal.
   The patients said the symptoms occurred in the same order as in
spontaneous attacks, he said.
   Bradwejn reported the study Tuesday at the American Psychiatric
Association's annual meeting.
   Panic attacks strike victims with overwhelming terror for no
apparent reason.
   Attacks can include such symptoms as sweating, heart
palpitations, trembling, shortness of breath, choking sensations,
faintness and fear of losing control or of dying.
   The first attack usually occurs by the victim's late 20s, and
episodes can recur several times a week, even daily. The disorder
can last for years, with varying periods of remission or
exacerbation.
   If not treated, panic sufferers can become suicidal.
   Researchers can trigger panic attacks in patients by exposing
them to carbon dioxide or other substances not found in the brain.
   Cholecystokinin's normal role appears to be helping brain and
nerve cells communicate, Bradwejn said. Its possible role in panic
attacks was suggested by experiments showing that its effect on
nerve cells was blocked by anti-panic medication, he said.
   In the new study, each patient received injections on each of
two days. One day they received cholecystokinin, the other day an
inert salt solution. No patient had an attack after the salt
solution.
   Attacks induced by the brain substance lasted about 21 minutes,
give or take about eight minutes, Bradwejn said.
   Besides normal symptoms, some patients reported blurred vision,
a warmth in the throat or chest, a bitter taste or a prickling in
the throat, he said.
   If cholecystokinin plays a role in spontaneous attacks, he said,
it is not clear whether the attacks are produced by a surge of its
natural levels or an abnormally high sensitivity to it.
   Marcus Raichle of Washington University in St. Louis, who has
studied brain abnormalities in panic disorder, said the next step
will be to see how the locations of cholecystokinin in the brain
correspond to the nerve circuitry that connects to areas implicated
in the disorder.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager was sentenced Tuesday to 52
years and eight months in prison for the slayings of three people,
after authorities reported the youth felt remorse because he had
lost his friends over the deaths.
   Superior Court Judge James Roach said it was obvious that the
defendant, Kenneth Bivert, 18, had not ``assumed responsibility for
the death of the three people.''
   Roach read from a Youth Authority report that said that Bivert
had said he was sorry but had not displayed evidence of his
``ability to empathize.''
   The report quoted Bivert as saying that ``the worst thing that
happened was that I lost 95 percent of my friends over this.''
   The judge said he gave Bivert the maximum sentence possible
under a plea bargain.
   Bivert, who pleaded guilty last January, and Anthony King, 17,
were charged with shooting to death Steve Patton, 35, of West
Sacramento, and Dawn and Raymond Rogers of Woodland.
   Bivert testified that the three were killed to obtain their cars
for a bank robbery that never took place.
   King is awaiting trial.
   Public Defender Lou Haffner said Bivert will be eligible for
parole in 26 years and four months, but he said it may be 30 or 40
years before his client is released.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu's decision to pass up
Tulane University's honorary degree pleases protesters up to a
point _ they wish they could hear the South African minister speak
on campus.
   The Alliance Against Apartheid, a student group opposed to the
racial segregation policy of the South African government, last
month demanded divestment of the university's holdings in South
Africa and built shanties on Tulane's campus in protest. A
spokesman for the group, Tim Wise, said Monday that the students
had hoped Tutu would refuse the degree but still make his speech.
   Tutu said Monday he could not ``in conscience'' accept the
degree because Tulane still has investments in 25 companies doing
business in South Africa. Tutu had been scheduled to speak at the
university Saturday and accept an honorary law degree Sunday.
   ``We're pleased with Tutu's decision to reject the doctorate,
but we would still like him to come to New Orleans. We think his
speaking here would be beneficial,'' said Wise.

   Since ABC's offer late last year, King has undergone heart

   ``I'm gonna sit in the booth with the regular CNN anchors during

   His early life as Perry Mason was no laughs
and long hours, says Raymond Burr, the actor who has resurrected
the courtroom sleuth for television movies.
   During the Mason CBS-series years, 1957-1966, Burr lived in a
Spartan bungalow at the studio to save travel time, rising at 3:30
a.m. and quitting work at 7:30 p.m., he said in an interview
published in next week's TV Guide.
   ``Mason never once, in nine years, had a sense of humor,'' Burr
said of the lawyer-detective character. ``Mason never once, in nine
years, had a single good friend.''
   Near the end of his ninth season, he orally agreed to a 10th and
final season. Then he read in a newspaper the series had been
canceled.
   ``Nothing about that end was nice,'' he said.

   The United States on Tuesday vetoed a
Security Council resolution that condemned Israel's recent raid
into south Lebanon and called for Israel to withdraw from Lebanon
and all occupied territories.
   The vote was 14-1, despite efforts to moderate the resolution to
avoid a U.S. veto.
   The United States frequently exercises its veto to kill
resolutions critical of the Jewish state.
   The vote came after a three-day debate requested by Lebanon,
which protested the two-day incursion.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, explaining the U.S. veto,
said the Security Council should not discuss southern Lebanon in
resolutions ``that fail to recognize the attacks and reprisals
originating on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border.''
   He said that armed Palestinians, supported by pro-Iranian
groups, repeatedly have tried to enter Israel from Lebanon in the
last four months to carry out violent acts.
   ``We cannot accept a resolution that does not acknowledge the
well-known fact that hostile acts against Israel are originating in
Lebanon,'' he said.
   Walters said the United States supports the independence,
territorial integrity and unity of Lebanon. Washington has called
for withdrawal of all foreign forces and the extension of central
government authority throughout that country, he said.
   But, he said, ``the sad truth remains that as long as armed,
extremist elements use southern Lebanon to stage terrorist attacks
against Israel, the border cannot be secure.''
   British Ambassador John Birch, the deputy permanent
representative, said the resolution failed to consider attacks
against Israel and hostilities on both sides of the
Israeli-Lebanese border. But he said Israel's latest incursion has
done damage to its cause and said Britain would vote for the
resolution ``in view of the excesses of Israel.''
   Israel said the two-day operation last week was necessary to
root out terrorists who stage attacks against Israel from Lebanese
territory.
   Israel said three Israeli soldiers and more than 40 Arab
guerrillas died in two days of fighting in south Lebanon last week.
   The meeting Tuesday was the sixth Security Council meeting in
six months called to deplore Israel's handling of the Palestinian
uprising, its deportation of Palestinians, its military actions in
south Lebanon and the assassination of a PLO leader in Tunisia that
has been blamed on Israel.
   In addition to the United States, the Security Council members
are Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union _ the five
permanent members with veto power _ and Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Italy, Japan, Nepal, Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

   Fireworks were used indoors illegally at a
Motley Crue concert, according to a lawyer for a teen-ager who lost
an eye while attending a performance by the heavy metal rock band.
   A civil lawsuit that went to trial this week seeks $2.2 million
for Robert Miller, 17, of Athens, who lost an eye, and $400,000 for
David Wright, 19, of Grant, who had his lip split.
   Jim Alexander, the teen-agers' attorney, said in his opening
statement Monday that flying debris hit his clients during the
Sept. 25, 1985 concert in Huntsville.
   But an attorney for Motley Crue Inc. told jurors there were no
explosives onstage that could propel objects through the air.
Stanley Rogers said the two teen-agers ``got hurt out there ... and
we can't explain it, but it did not come from special effects.''
   Nikki Sixx, a member of Motley Crue, sat quietly in Limestone
County Circuit Court during jury selection. Sixx is president of
Motley Crue Inc.
   Sitting across the room was Miller, whose injury occurred at his
first concert, a birthday present from his parents just days before
his 15th birthday. Miller was permanently blinded in his right eye
from an object that came shooting off the stage, Alexander said.
   Miller has said the material that struck him was similar to dry
ice, which Alexander said was being used to create a smoke effect.
   The defendants say they are not responsible for injuries
suffered by Miller and Wright.
   The city of Huntsville, Von Braun Civic Center and Sound 70
Productions Inc. of Nashville are also defendants.
   Heavy metal rock concerts were not a familiar subject to many of
the prospective jurors. About 10 said they simply do not like rock
music, and two asked to be excused for religious reasons.

<HEAD>Trade Bill Going to Reagan After Effort Fails To Drop Alaska Oil
Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic leaders Tuesday prepared to send
the omnibus trade bill to President Reagan this week for an
expected veto after efforts to erase its Alaska oil provisions
proved futile.
   ``I had hoped that if these offending provisions had been
eliminated the president would have had one less reason for vetoing
this bill,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said
after a move to drop the oil provisions was thwarted.
   Labor leaders, clergymen and other supporters of the 1,000-page
bill were invited to a Wednesday ceremony at which House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, planned to sign the bill.
   It won final passage in the Senate on April 27 but instead of
being sent to Reagan's desk has been becalmed on Capitol Hill while
leaders have sought to do a bit of after-the-fact tailoring.
   Byrd on Tuesday sought unanimous consent to take up a technical
resolution that would have erased the bill's restrictions on
exports of Alaska oil.
   The technical resolution, approved last week by the House, would
have instructed an official known as the enrolling clerk to dot i's
and cross some t's in the bill _ and erase the Alaska oil
provisions at the same time.
   Unlike House leaders, however, Byrd needed to obtain unanimous
consent before bringing the resolution to the floor.
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said there were a number of
objections among Republicans to bringing up the resolution.
   Doing so without a time limit, Dole added, would merely launch a
long string of amendments involving complex issues ranging from
plant-closings to Caribbean ethanol imports.
   ``We would have a full-scale trade debate here for several
days,'' he said,
   That appeared to end the effort to strike the oil exports curbs,
one of two features Reagan has said would justify his planned veto.
The other is a provision that would require companies with 100 or
more employees to provide 60-day notice of plant-closings and
large-scale layoffs.
   One of the Alaska provisions would limit exports from new Alaska
refineries to 70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of total output.
The other would clear the way for export to Canada of 50,000
barrels of crude daily. But it would require that the oil be
transported first in an American vessel to a West Coast port in the
lower 48 states, such as Seattle, and then reshipped.
   The features are favorites of maritime unions and similar
versions appear in the currently pending U.S.-Canada free-trade
agreement. Critics have said that they violate a constitutional ban
on discrimination against one state's port to the advantage of
another state's port.

<TEXT>
   Abby Hoffman no longer wants
action from his audiences. Reaction will do.
   The 51-year-old former Yippie has begun taking the stage as a
comedian, rather than as an advocate who used humor.
   Hoffman, 51, who gained notoriety as one of the Chicago Seven
defendants charged with inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic
national convention, says he is discovering that middle age isn't
any easier for a Yippie than it is for a yuppie.
   ``It isn't a bowl of cherries,'' Hoffman said in a recent
interview. ``That's what I tell the kids when I go on campus to
speak.''
   The environmental activist speaks at more than 50 university
campuses a year, at $3,000 an appearance, but he was in this town
55 miles southeast of Los Angeles on Tuesday for a comedy gig at
the Coach House.
   ``This isn't new, this comedy stuff, because I was a bit of a
stand-up comedian during the '60s,'' said Hoffman, who offered a
pig as a presidential candidate during the 1968 elections.
   Hoffman said the Coach House appearance was his fourth as a
comedian in the past two years.
   ``The difference is that, in the '60s, they shot and threw bags
of garbage at me, so this seems pretty tame by comparison,'' he
said.

   You can lead a horse to water, but you
can't make him as cheap and easy to operate as four-wheel drive.
   That's how the Suffolk County Parks Department sees it; so its
mounted rangers division is out to pasture.
   John Sheridan, commissioner of parks and recreation, said Monday
that horse patrols were ``a luxury that we could no longer afford.''
   Rangers can cover more ground in small four-wheel-drive vehicles
and the switch will save the county $10,000 to $12,000 a year, he
said.
   Mounted patrols began in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in 1979
in an effort to improve public relations and to patrol park land
that might otherwise be inaccessible.

   People in this south Louisiana town are

   The town has a new $2 million switching system which allows
tone-dialing telephones and services such as call waiting. But the
system won't allow customers to leave off the exchange when they
make calls.
   The 4,500 customers in Rayne and the 2,800 in nearby Duson are

   By the state's reckoning, when this farming
town voted last year to expand membership of the Finance Committee,
they actually authorized the construction of wharves on the
opposite side of the state.
   And in 1985, according to the state attorney general's office,
when residents thought they were offsetting town receipts, they
unwittingly exempted the town accountant in Framingham from Civil
Service.
   Hadley Town Clerk Joanna P. Devine said Tuesday that she
discovered the mixup when a resident asked to check the original
wording of the Hadley resolutions.
   The measures Hadley thought it passed were apparently
transformed into a quite different chapter and section of town law
by keypunching errors after the actions of the town meetings in
Hadley, Haverhill and Framingham were compiled and submitted to the
attorney general for review, she said.
   ``Our intent (in passing the measures) was clear. But something
happened _ there was a typo or an error at the printers that no one

   Undaunted, Hadley voters have tried again.
   ``We brought both issues back to the floor of the town meeting
and they were approved again last Thursday night,'' Ms. Devine said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Lehder at War With U.S., Cocaine Is His Weapon</HEAD>

   Reputed Colombian drug kingpin Carlos
Lehder Rivas saw cocaine as a revolutionary weapon against the
United States, a prosecutor said Tuesday in final arguments in
Lehder's cocaine-smuggling trial.
   ``He's still at war,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle told the
jury. ``He hasn't stopped.''
   Lehder considered cocaine a weapon, and ``you see where his
missiles landed,'' Merkle said, pointing to a map showing where
Lehder allegedly had cocaine flown into the United States.
   Merkle, holding a tiny cocaine spoon, said the government had
proved that Lehder imported 18,000 kilograms, or about 39,600
pounds, of the powder into the United States. He asked the jury to
consider how much time it would take to dip out that amount, a
spoonful at a time. He then provided an answer:
   ``More time that you have remaining on this earth.''
   A cart holding 277 pounds of cocaine stood beside him as he
spoke.
   Authorities say Lehder, 38, is a leader of the so-called
Medellin Cartel, believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine smuggled into the United States, prosecutors have said. He
is charged with bringing 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States
from 1978 to 1980, paying bribes and making threats to use Norman's
Cay in the Bahamas as a private relay station.
   ``Carlos Lehder and Henry Ford had a lot in common,'' Merkle
said. ``Carlos Lehder was the pioneer of the mass transporation of
cocaine for the American consumer.''
   The prosecutor also referred to old TV interviews of Lehder
played during the trial, telling jurors to take the defendant at
his word.
   ``He told you cocaine has become a revolutionary weapon to
destroy the (U.S.) empire,'' said Merkle. ``The end justifies the
means.''
   Defense attorneys, who rested without calling witnesses, were
expected to close Wednesday.
   Merkle blasted defense arguments that Lehder had been used by
convicted smuggler and key prosecution witness Ed Ward.
   ``Ed Ward is not the king of cocaine,'' the prosecutor said,
adding that to equate Lehder's organization to Ward's group of
American smugglers was like ``comparing the Boston Red Sox to the
Little League.''
   Merkle also pointed to acts of violence laid to Lehder, and
referred to a September 1978 meeting, in which Lehder reportedly
said, ``Every once in a while in this business someone has to die.''
   Merkle also mentioned threats to those who ventured to Norman's
Cay, including former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite.
   A total of 115 government witnesses, many of them convicted
smugglers, depicted Lehder as a flamboyant, womanizing, neo-Nazi
who used money and force to build a cocaine-smuggling kingdom on
the Bahamian island.
   The jury, which heard 22 weeks of testimony, likely will get the
case Friday and begin its deliberations on the 11-count indictment
that charges Lehder with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   If convicted, Lehder faces up to life plus 165 years in prison
and the forfeiture of his assets in the Bahamas to the U.S.
government.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy. He faces
up to 15 years in prison.

<HEAD>Top Official To Help End Turf War Over Pursuit Of Fugitives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is
designating a top Justice Department official to help end a turf
war between the FBI and the Marshals Service over the pursuit of
fugitives, a department spokesman said Tuesday.
   Under the arrangement, Meese is trying to settle the
longstanding feud by having acting Associate Attorney General
Francis Keating arbitrate individual disagreements over whether the
FBI or Marshals Service will handle a particular fugitive
investigation.
   The Marshals Service has been increasingly successful under a
1979 agreement with the FBI in tracking down fugitives, but the FBI
has said the marshals have expanded their role too far.
   Sources at the FBI and Marshals Service, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said little appears to have changed under Meese's
decision and that the main alteration has been to set up a dispute
mechanism in the associate attorney general's office.
   Meese told FBI Director William Sessions last week the bureau
generally retains jurisdiction of tracking down escapees who fled
after being arrested but before going to trial, said Justice
Department spokesman Terry Eastland.
   Meese told Marshals Service chief Stanley Morris that his agency
retains jurisdiction over the apprehension of fugitives who escaped
after being convicted, Eastland said.
   Under Meese's decision, the FBI generally would have
jurisdiction over all fugitives _ whether in the pre- or
post-conviction phase _ involved in foreign counterintelligence
cases, organized crime or terrorism.
   But if the Marshals Service has made major progress on a
fugitive case, it might ask to assist or take over an FBI fugitive
investigation, said Eastland.
   In addition, the FBI may ask the Marshals Service to turn over
jurisdiction over an investigation involving a fugitive who has
been convicted but who has committed new crimes after fleeing.
   The sources said the attorney general's decision leaves the door
open, contingent on the approval of the associate attorney
general's office, for the Marshals Service to continue aggressive
pursuit in the types of investigations that led to the apprehension
of Edwin Wilson.
   Wilson is an ex-CIA official who was sought for training Libyan
terrorists and supplying them with explosives. The marshals lured
Wilson to the Dominican Republic and put him on a flight to the
United States, where he was arrested.

<HEAD>Reagan Gives Highest Civilian Award to Departing NATO Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan awarded the Presidential
Medal of Freedom to outgoing NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington
on Tuesday, saying his ``gift of statesmanship'' helped unify the
alliance.
   ``Your efforts on behalf of us all during the past four years
has set a new standard,'' Reagan told Carrington, who will be
succeeded at the end of his term in June by West German Defense
Minister Manfred Woerner.
   ``Your stewardship of the alliance has continued a life's work
in support of human decency and the ideal of freedom, the very
basis of the compact for peace that we call NATO,'' the president
said in presenting him the medal, the nation's highest civilian
award.
   Reagan said Carrington had done a good job of bringing together
the views of North Atlantic Treaty Organization members.
   ``Reconciling the occasionally differing views of the European
members of the alliance with those of the North Americans is a
special challenge,'' he said. ``But one of your special gifts has
always been an ability to find common ground, and nowhere is that
more important than at NATO. You believed in NATO when it counted
and that spirit has been contagious.''
   ``It has been your gift of statesmanship which has brought our
transatlantic partnership to a level of unity and common purpose
unparalleled in the history of NATO,'' Reagan said.
   Some 75 Presidential Medals of Freedom have been awarded by
Reagan, but few of them for non-U.S. citizens. Among the foreigners
to have been honored were Anwar Sadat, the former president of
Egypt, who was given the award posthumously; Joseph Luns,
Carrington's predecessor at NATO; and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.
   Carrington paid tribute to the president for supporting the
alliance and keeping America's defense strong.

<TEXT>
   Beverly Sills, the New York City Opera's
long-time star soprano who took over the company and helped rescue
it from financial disaster, announced Tuesday that she will retire
at the end of the year.
   ``I think 10 years is long enough,'' Miss Sills said of her
second career as general director of the nation's second-largest
opera company in terms of budget and number of performances.
   She said she thought it was important that a new five-year plan
be created to guide the company, and, noting she will be 60 next
spring, said ``I don't think this young, vital company should be
run by a 65-year-old woman.''
   Miss Sills said a search for her successor would begin soon and
that upon her retirement she would become president of the
company's board and would continue to help raise funds.
   She met with reporters at the New York State Theater, where the
New York City Opera performs in Lincoln Center, next door to the
Metropolitan Opera House.
   The theater was the scene of many of her triumphs during a
20-year singing career that included such widely varying roles as
the doomed maiden of Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' and the
romantic heroine of Massenet's ``Manon.''
   But it was her managerial triumphs that took center stage
Tuesday.
   Robert Wilson, chairman of the board, said that when Miss Sills
became head of the company, taking over from Julius Rudel, ``We
hardly had enough money to meet the payroll; it was a close call.
   ``Now we have a surplus of $3 million,'' he said. ``For the last
five years we've been operating profitably.''
   The company's budget for fiscal 1989, which begins July 1, is
projected at $26 million. In 1978, when she took over, the budget
was nearly $9 million.
   Wilson also said performing standards had risen under Miss
Sills' regime, and that she had ``achieved artistic revival with
demonic determination to control costs.''
   He praised Miss Sills' introduction of English surtitles above
the stage, her combining spring and fall seasons into one season
and her finding financing for five years of a spring musical comedy
season.
   During her tenure as general director, Miss Sills has emphasized
the engagement of young American singers and American conductors,
designers and directors. She has stressed acting as well as singing.
   Miss Sills said she was considering various plans for the
future, but insisted she would ``never go to work for another opera
company.''
   ``The profit-making world seems awfully attractive to me,'' she
said. ``You aren't out with a tin cup. I have been offered a talk
show. I might do that.'' She also said she planned to ``take a
little vacation with my husband when the dust settles and see if he
can remember what my first name is.''
   Though she sang in Europe and made her debut at the Metropolitan
Opera in 1975, most of her singing career was at the New York State
Opera. She starred in the New York premiere of Douglas Moore's
``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' in 1958 and shot to acclaim in 1966 when
she sang Cleopatra opposite bass-baritone Norman Treigle in
Handel's ``Julius Caesar.''
   The warmth of her stage personality made the title role of
``Manon'' her best role. Audiences also loved her in ``Lucia di
Lammermoor'' and ``The Daughter of the Regiment.'' She took on a
harder challenge and triumphed when she sang Donizetti's three
Tudor queens, Elizabeth in ``Roberto Devereux,'' ``Maria Stuarda''
and ``Anna Bolena.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
Tuesday that he doesn't understand why the U.S. Senate has not
ratified an arms control treaty that bans medium- and shorter-range
nuclear weapons.
   U.S. officials said, however, that a dispute has arisen over
verification issues.
   ``Basically the verification problems regarding the INF treaty
have been resolved, I think,'' Shevardnadze said after arriving at
Geneva's Cointrin airport.
   The Soviet foreign minister begins a two-day meeting with
Secretary of State George Shultz here on Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze's statement contrasted with remarks by Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in Washington, who said a
serious dispute had broken out over verification issues.
   The verification dispute centers primarily on U.S. allegations
that the Soviets are trying to restrict access by U.S. monitors to
Soviet missile plants and sites.
   The Intermediate Nuclear Forces accord, which bans nuclear
missiles with a range of about 300 to 3,000 miles, was signed Dec.
8 by President Reagan and Soviet Communist party leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   ``I'm not quite clear what the problems, what the difficulties
in the Senate are. We have not been told yet,'' Shevardnadze said
after arriving at Geneva's Cointrin airport.
   Another Senator, David Boren, D-Okla., said Soviet officials
``have turned us down flatly'' on some verification issues
previously thought to have been settled. He said there were about
10 outstanding and unresolved verification issues.
   Senators had expressed hope that the problems could be resolved
during the Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting.
   The Senate has postponed debate on the treaty until the dispute
is resolved. The United States last month asked the Soviets for an
explanation, and the Soviets replied Sunday night.
   Shevardnadze told reporters that the U.S. side ``was asking
certain questions, certain points of clarification'' on the
verification issue. ``We answered those questions and we thought
that there is no problem,'' he said.
   A U.S. official in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``We don't consider the Soviet response to our
questions fully satisfactory. There's more work to be done.''
   Shevardnadze said that on other questions, not dealing with INF
verification, ``we have brought new ideas.'' He did not elaborate.
   Other items on the foreign ministers' agenda are conventional
weapons, nuclear testing, regional problems and bilateral and
humanitarian issues, Shevardnadze said.
   Shevardnadze downplayed prospects for quick agreement on another
arms control agreement, called START, that would cut strategic, or
intercontinental nuclear forces by up to 50 percent.
   He said he did not think the two sides would be able to complete
work on that agreement by the Moscow summit May 29-June 2.
   ``But we will try to achieve substantial progress,'' he added.
   At their summit meeting last December, Reagan and Gorbachev had
instructed their negotiators to try to prepare a START treaty in
time for signing at the Moscow meeting.
   Shevardnadze said it was difficult to predict when a START
agreement might be completed. ``But a lot of work has been done and
I think that we will be able to make some progress here in Geneva
and particularly during the Moscow summit.''
   In Moscow, Soviet media on Tuesday reported that the U.S. Senate
has indefinitely postponed ratification of the arms accord.
   The government newspaper Izvestia accused Senate Democrats of
playing an election-year ``political game.''
   Although the Soviet government is also going through a detailed
ratification process, final approval is a formality because the
treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev has already been endorsed by
the ruling 13-man Politburo.

<TEXT>
   Sporadic sniper fire crackled in the
Shiite Moslem slums Tuesday and rival militiamen fortified their
positions, apparently convinced that a truce arranged by the Syrian
army would not last.
   Families streamed out of the ramshackle 16 square miles of south
Beirut, carrying mattresses, bundles of clothing and other
possessions. About 250,000 Shiites lived in the slums before the
battle began last Friday, but police said 60 percent had fled by
Tuesday.
   The 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including nine Americans,
are also thought to be held captive in the slums.
   Police reported five people wounded by sniper fire. Gone at
least temporarily were the tank, mortar and rocket duels between
the Shiite militias Amal and Hezbollah that killed at least 154
people and wounded 372 in the previous four days.
   Before dawn, 36 Syrian officers moved into the area with six
committees to man truce observation posts. Police said each
committee included an Iranian Embassy official, a representative of
Amal and another of Hezbollah.
   Amal, a mainstream militia backed by Syria, and the radical,
pro-Iranian Hezbollah are fighting for control of the slums. Amal
is Arabic for Hope and Hezbollah means Party of God.
   Syria and Iran, allies in public, are competing behind the
scenes for influence with the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's
largest sect.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria keeps 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon,
including 7,500 in Beirut. After 13 years of civil war, he was the
country's undisputed power broker until Iran began challenging the
Syrian position.
   There still was no word Tuesday on the fate of the hostages,
most of whom are believed held by kidnappers linked to Hezbollah.
   A police source said it was ``physically impossible'' for
hostages to have been smuggled out because Amal and the Syrian army
control the slum exits.
   The Syrians sent 7,500 soldiers to Moslem west Beirut in
February 1987 to stop a factional war in which the two main
elements were Amal and the Druse militia led by Walid Jumblatt.
   They drove Hezbollah militiamen from some outposts in west
Beirut but have stayed out of the southern Shiite slums.
   Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon said Tuesday,
however: ``It is impermissible to let the current state of affairs
continue.''
   When asked whether soldiers would be sent into the slums if the
fighting did not stop, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan said: ``We hope it
won't come to that, but we shall not allow the bloodshed to
continue.''
   A Lebanese police spokesman, whose name cannot be revealed
because of regulations, said the truce committees were ``trying to
convince the warring factions to observe a cease-fire as a first
step.''
   The three-point truce plan announced Monday calls for a
cease-fire, pulling militiamen off the streets and a return to
positions held before the battle began.
   Hezbollah, which has gained control of about half the slum area
since Friday, ``rejects the return to pre-Friday positions,'' the
police spokesman said Tuesday.
   Militiamen of Hezbollah were seen fortifying their positions
with earthworks in the densely populated districts Ghobeiri, Bir
el-Abed and Hay Madi.
   Amal controls the Haret Hreik, Mreiji, Roweiss, Shiyah and
Kasskass districts, plus the main gateways into the slums.
   According to the police spokesman, Amal moved in 1,000 more
fighters from the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon, a main base for the
Syrian army. The ancient city of Baalbek in the Bekaa is a
Hezbollah stronghold.
   ``It appears that both sides are preparing for another round of
fighting,'' the police spokesman said.
   How many combatants have been involved on both sides is unclear.
A police source said Hezbollah could put about 5,000 men in the
field, but Amal is believed to be larger and has a broader
following among the Shiites.
   Ibrahim Sarhan, a vegetable vendor, and his wife and four
children walked out of the slums Tuesday carrying mattresses and
clothes.
   ``We have been living in a basement since Friday,'' he said. ``I
think this is the beginning of a long battle. We will come back
when this is over.''
   Mohammed Milhem, a 30-year-old grocer, was trying to patch a
bullet hole in his car's gas tank.
   ``We need the car to get out of here,'' he said. His wife and
three daughters were packing the car with mattresses, clothing, a
television set and a sewing machine.
   Some of those who flee have family or friends elsewhere in
Lebanon. Others camp out on the streets of west Beirut or take
refuge in schools, mosques or sports stadiums.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Seize ID Cards in Gaza Sweep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops roused
Palestinians at dawn Tuesday and confiscated their identity papers
in a new campaign to force 400,000 Arabs in the Gaza Strip to renew
their government ID cards.
   Arab underground leaders warned residents via leaflets and
mosque loudspeakers that the ID campaign in the Gaza Strip was a
plot to break a five-month Palestinian uprising.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of Israeli troops in
Gaza, said the effort was designed to ferret out false ID cards and
catch security and tax offenders. Refusal to pay taxes and other
fees has been a chief tactic of the struggle against Israel's
21-year occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Some of the new cards actually banned Palestinians from entering
Israel.
   Also Tuesday, Israeli troops shot and wounded an Arab youth in
the stomach after an army jeep was stoned in the West Bank village
of Ramin, eight miles north of Nablus, the military command said.
   The unidentified youth was in serious condition, officials at
nearby Tulkarem hospital said. The army said a soldier was slightly
wounded.
   The United Nations said 185 Arabs and two Israelis have been
killed since the violence in the occupied territories started Dec.
8. The army said this week that more than 1,400 Palestinians have
been injured, along with 298 soldiers and 172 Israeli settlers.
   In the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, underground leaflets told Arab
residents to resist the Israeli campaign to renew identity cards.
   ``Do not change your ID cards,'' the leaflets read. ``This will
harm the uprising's achievements and strength.''
   Troops banged on doors at dawn to awake Palestinians and demand
their papers.
   ``They banged on windows and doors and ordered us to hand over
our identity cards. They said we had to change them,'' said Sheik
Khalo, a Moslem religious leader from Gaza City.
   The army said about 2,000 of the 8,000 residents of Gaza City's
Rimal area applied for new ID cards.
   Hundreds of Palestinians crowded into large, dust-covered tents
at two schools converted into makeshift registration centers. Many
said the army forced them to come.
   The orders affect Palestinians between the ages 16 and 60, who
have to pay $10 for new cards. The army said it would take about
three months to issue new IDs to everyone.
   Arabs in the occupied lands must carry an identity card at all
times and show the card at frequent security checks. Identity cards
are vital for all transactions with the military government.
   Many of the hundreds of Arabs standing in the sweltering heat
for about four hours Tuesday waiting for their pictures to be taken
were angry because there was only one photographer.
   ``It is Ramadan (a Moslem holy month). We are fasting,'' said
Ahmed Abu Hassan, 26. ``We are not animals to spend all day here
waiting. Instead of changing our identity cards the Israelis should
change their minds about occupying our land.''
   The Itim news agency said some new identity cards carried a
message saying the bearer was barred from entering Israel. A
military source confirmed there were ``special instructions'' on
some cards but refused to elaborate.
   An 18-year-old Palestinian who identified himself only as
Mohammed said he would not change his card.
   ``On the new IDs, they will write all the previous times I was
in prison,'' he said. ``If it's written on the ID that I was in
prison I will get special treatment. Everytime I get stopped, the
soldiers will beat me.''
   The army also said Tuesday it had cracked a guerrilla ring in
the Gaza Strip that was planning to carry out a suicide bombing in
Tel Aviv's central bus station.
   The group, identified as belonging to Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was also linked to four
other attacks, including laying a mine that injured four Israeli
troops in Gaza last March and planting a bomb at an Israeli school
south of Tel Aviv in February, an army spokesman said. No one was
hurt by the bomb.
   A military representative speaking on condition of anonymity
said the ring was broken last week.
   Meanwhile, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dan Shomron said Tuesday
that Israeli settlers were aggravating tension in the occupied
territories.
   He cited a clash with Arabs at Beita in the West Bank last month
in which an Israeli teen-ager died.
   In another development, Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin
Luther King Jr., appealed to Israeli leaders to release
Arab-American activist Mubarak Awad from jail and cancel a
deportation order against him.
   The government has blamed Awad, who advocates civil disobedience
against Israel's occupation, for inciting violence. He was moved
Tuesday to Ramle prison from the Jerusalem jail where he had been
held since Thursday, a police spokesman said.
   Awad, who had been on a hunger strike since his arrest, accepted
food for the first time Tuesday, eating an orange, said his
American-born wife, Nancy Nye. It was not immediately clear whether
he would resume his fast, she said.

   About 1,000 people with AIDS will kill
themselves by 1991 if current trends continue, researchers said
Tuesday.
   They based that figure on an estimate of 380 suicides per
100,000 diagnosed AIDS cases in a New York study.
   Peter Marzuk of Cornell University Medical College in New York
said the relatively high rate indicates that mental health
professionals should help patients better deal with the stresses of
the deadly disease. He added they should aggressively treat
psychiatric symptoms that may contribute to suicide risk.
   He and his colleagues described the work at the American
Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.
   Researchers reviewed medical examiner records for all New York
City suicides in 1985 through 1987.
   They found 42 suicides by people with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome during that period, of about 11,000 city residents with
the disease.
   Ages ranged from 22 to 58, with an average of 38. All were men.
Fifty-seven percent were homosexuals or bisexuals and 12 percent
intravenous drug users. The rest had other risk factors for the
disease or the factors were unknown, Marzuk said.
   Two-thirds of the group killed themselves within six months of
being told they had AIDS, he said.
   Another period of high risk was in the later stages of the
disease, when euthanasia might play a role, he said.
   The effect of the AIDS virus on the central nervous system and
psychological pressures of the disease appear to contribute to the
suicide rate, he said. The virus may generate depression, dementia,
psychosis or other conditions that could contribute to suicide
risk, he said. And the diagnosis often forces the person to reveal
homosexuality or illicit drug use to family and friends, who may
then abandon the person, he said.
   Marzuk also said homosexuals and intravenous drug users are
thought to have higher-than-normal suicide rates, even without AIDS.
   The research updates results based on suicides in 1985.
   The updated statistics appear to bear out the early data that
men, ages 20 to 59, with AIDS run 36 times the risk of suicide as
comparable men without the disease, Marzuk said.
   The early data also suggested an overall suicide risk of 66
times the rates of other people of the same ages and gender.
   Those estimates are ``very close to what we suspect,'' said
Steve Morin of the American Psychological Association's task force
on psychology and AIDS.
   It will be important to compare the rates to those of homosexual
men without the diagnosis to find the impact of the disease itself,
he said.
   In other research described Tuesday, researchers said they found
evidence that simply educating inner-city youth about the risks of
getting the virus through sexual contact fails to cut their risk.
   A study of 102 residents of the Newark, N.J., area found no
relationship between their degree of knowledge about sexual
transmission of the virus and their amount of high-risk sexual
behavior, researchers said.

   Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused the United
States of threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinian
guerrillas attack American targets.
   The United States denied the accusation.
   The State Department said in Washington that it had received
reports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S.
involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir, the PLO's second
in command.
   Wazir was slain April 16 during a raid on his house near Tunis,
Tunisia. Israeli officials who spoke on condition they not be
identified said an Israeli squad carried out the assassination.
   There have been accusations by the PLO that the United States
knew about and approved plans for slaying Wazir.
   Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, claimed
the threat to kill PLO officials was made in a U.S. government
document the PLO obtained from an Arab government. He refused to
identify the government.
   In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy
denied Arafat's accusation that the United States threatened PLO
officials.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States
has been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries about
possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
   He added that Arafat's interpretation of those contacts was
``entirely without foundation.''
   Arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villa
in Baghdad, where extra security guards have been deployed. He said
security also was being augmented at PLO offices around the Arab
world following the alleged threat.
   He produced a photocopy of the alleged document. It appeared to
be part of a longer document with the word ``CONFIDENTIAL'' stamped
at the bottom.
   The document, which was typewritten in English, referred to
Wazir by his code name, Abu Jihad. It read:
   ``You may be aware of charges in several Middle Eastern and
particulary Palestinian circles that the U.S. knew of and approved
Abu Jihad's assassination.
   ``On April 18th (a) State Department spokesman said that the
United States `condemns this act of political assassination,' `had
no knowledge of' and `was not involved in any way in this
assassination.
   ``It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafat
may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against
American citizens and facilities abroad, possibly in retaliation
for last month's assassination of Abu Jihad.
   ``Any possible targeting of American personnel and facilities in
retaliation for Abu Jihad's assassination would be totally
reprehensible and unjustified. We would hold the PLO responsible
for any such attacks.''
   Arafat said the document ``reveals the U.S. administration is
planning, in full cooperation with the Israelis, to conduct a
crusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the PLO for them.
   ``These attacks will then be used to justify the assassination
of PLO leaders.''
   He strongly denied that the PLO planned any such attacks.

<HEAD>Carlucci Says U.S. Military Lacks Training To Fight Drug-Runners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

   The military shouldn't become deeply involved
in fighting illegal drugs because soldiers aren't properly trained
to enforce civilian laws, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told
Congress on Tuesday.
   ``I do not believe law enforcement, making arrests, is
appropriate'' for the military, Carlucci said. ``I think it is
unwise to get the military into the law enforcement question.''
   ``Do we shoot people? Do we shoot down planes?'' he said at a
hearing of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   Carlucci was trying to deal with a rising wave of sentiment in
Congress that the military should be used more heavily to block the
flow of illegal drugs into the United States.
   Last week the House voted 385-23 to order President Reagan to
have the military seal the U.S. borders against drug traffickers.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said earlier this week that
House leaders are drafting an anti-drug bill that will increase the
military role.
   Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., asked the Pentagon on Tuesday to
develop within 10 days a plan for using military resources to stop
the cross-border drug flow.
   Nichols, chairman of the House armed services investigations
subcommittee, made his request after a hearing at which a
bipartisan group of lawmakers also chastised Pentagon officials for
their reluctance to increase military involvement in the war on
drugs.
   ``We recognize that this is a mission that you would enter into
with some degree of concern,'' Nichols said. ``It's not the normal
duties that have been assigned to the military. ... But I have to
ask myself, if not the military, then who? We're not getting the
job done.''
   Nichols said he wants the Pentagon's drug interdiction plan
ready for subcommittee hearings later this month in Miami and El
Paso, Texas.
   The Senate is expected to debate and vote on similar proposals
this week as the chamber works on its version of a Pentagon budget
bill. One of the Senate amendments is being written by Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee.
   Military enforcement of civilian laws is banned by an 1878 law,
the Posse Comitatus Act, but Congress amended the law six years ago
to allow the Pentagon to share some information with civilian law
enforcement agencies.
   Since then, Carlucci noted, military planes and ships routinely
have given information to law enforcement officials, including the
Drug Enforcement Administration. Coast Guard personnel ride aboard
Navy ships in the Caribbean Sea to make drug arrests.
   ``Thousands and thousands of planes fly across our borders
annually with drugs,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., told Carlucci.
``Either we're going to have a war on drugs and get the military
involved or we're not.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said, ``We're at war here and we
think the people to be handling a war are in the Department of
Defense.''
   Carlucci answered that ``I agree that there is a war on, but I
believe it is a different kind of war than the military is involved
in.''
   ``We can do a certain amount of this and we are doing the
maximum,'' Carlucci said of current anti-drug efforts.
   ``The military are not trained for the law enforcement
mission,'' Carlucci said. ``To suddenly tell them you're in law
enforcement, you have to shift the entire focus, the training. ...
There's a major difference between military and police work. Our
people are not trained to read Miranda rights, they are trained to
shoot to kill.''
   At the House hearing, Grant Green, assistant secretary of
defense for force management and personnel, said, ``We need to look
at what we as a country can realistically accomplish in (drug)
interdiction. We can't just say, `Seal the borders in 30 days.'''
   Green said using the military to close U.S. borders to drug
traffickers would cost a minimum of $20 billion and harm Pentagon
readiness.

   Wind storms and fire snarled air traffic at
O'Hare International Airport earlier this week and when a gunman
threatened to shoot at airplanes Tuesday, authorities reached an
inescapable conclusion.
   ``It was a pretty bad week,'' said Mort Edelstein, spokesman for
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Storms and a fire severing phone links between the FAA control
center and Chicago's two airports disrupted air service around the
Midwest on Sunday and into Monday.
   Just as things were on their way back to normal Tuesday, the
gunman struck.
   From an apartment in a suburb near O'Hare, one of the world's
busiest airports, the gunman forced authorities to divert about 125
departing flights from a runway that would have sent them over the
building, Edelstein said.
   The diversions resulted in delays of up to 20 minutes a flight,
Edelstein added.
   The gunman, who surrendered after allegedly shooting a policeman
in the foot, was being held in DuPage County Jail.
   By midday Tuesday, Edelstein said things were returning to
normal. But ``the weather is very bad in Atlanta,'' and authorities
were watching whether that would affect flights at O'Hare, he said.
   A week of troubles began on what had been a balmy Mother's Day
as storms swirled into the Chicago area on wind gusting up to 80
mph. A tornado touched down about 40 miles southwest of Chicago.
   While the storm raged, firefighters battled a fire that swept
through an Illinois Bell telephone switching station in suburban
Hinsdale. That cut off telephone service for thousands of customers
and severed the phone link between the FAA's control center in
Aurora and air traffic control computers at O'Hare and Chicago's
other major airport, Midway.
   Without the computer links, controllers had to use back-up phone
lines to get air traffic information manually, Edelstein said.
   Nearly half the lines from Aurora to O'Hare were restored or
rerouted Tuesday, Edelstein said, adding authorities expected all
the circuits to be working by Wednesday.
   The combination of weather and disrupted phone service caused
delays and flight cancellations.
   ``We had delays as long as two hours at its height, Sunday night
and early Monday morning,'' said Joe Hopkins, spokesman for
Chicago-based United Airlines.
   The airline canceled about 40 of 800 flights in and out of
O'Hare on Sunday, he said.
   Alexandra Boettcher, 25, of Chicago tried to leave Detroit's
Metropolitan Airport on Sunday for Midway, but gave up when her
Southwest Airlines flight was delayed.
   She returned Monday to face more delays.
   ``At one point, they said there were 17 planes waiting on the
runway, plus I was number 17 on a standby list,'' she said.
   She and three other people she met at the airport rented a car
and drove the nearly 300 miles back to Chicago.
   ``Hopefully, we beat the plane back,'' she said. ``We don't
know.''

   Frank Perkins says ``I begin my act by
telling people that my show is pure _ pure plagiarism,'' and it's
all down hill from there.
   Or ``Up New Hampshire,'' depending on how you look at it.
   Perkins steals all his jokes, synchs some of his playing with
such musical non-humorists as Mozart, and plays a bizarre
assortment of instruments that includes a horn made out of a toilet.
   His commodohorn, as he calls it, is constructed of a commode,
vacuum-cleaner hose and old-fashioned kitchen sink tap. He also has
a plumbaphone, an instrument resembling a clarinet, which is made
from a bathroom plunger with a bug light at the suction end.
   Perkins also is said to be virtuoso of the musical saw.
   Perkins calls his group, of which he is the only member, the
Bagaduce Symphony Orchestra and Two-Step Dance Band. He calls his
program of musical humor, up-country yarns and unusual instruments
``Up New Hampshire.''
   He plays for civic groups and at events lined up for him by
relatives and friends. Perkins, who manages a summer resort camp,
said the saw is his favorite instrument.
   ``It has a real haunting sound to it that really gets to you _
well, at least it does to me,'' he said.
   ``It's the jiggle in the foot that keeps the tremor going,'' he
said. ``If you don't keep it up, it's just like any other
instrument _ if you don't play all the time you lose the touch.''

   President Francois Mitterrand named Socialist
Michel Rocard as premier Tuesday to form a new government following
Mitterrand's decisive victory in the presidential election.
   Premier Jacques Chirac resigned and Mitterrand swiftly picked
Rochard, a popular politician who describes himself as a
``free-enterprise leftist.''
   Mitterrand, also a Socialist, defeated the conservative Chirac
in Sunday's presidential election. Chirac had been premier since
his conservative alliance defeated the Socialists in 1986 for
control of Parliament.
   Rocard, who has centrist support, went to his new offices in the
Hotel Matignon on the Left Bank early in the evening for the
transfer of power.
   Afterward, Rocard told reporters, ``The president has given me a
tough job.'' He said he would form a Cabinet bearing in mind the
French people's worries ``for their future, for their jobs, for
their education, for their security.''
   Under the French constitution, the president is responsible for
foreign affairs, defense and guarding the nation's interests
abroad, while the premier runs day-to-day government.
   After meeting with Rocard, Chirac left for the Paris City Hall,
where he maintains an apartment. He has been mayor since 1977.
   Under the French system, voters choose a president and a
parliament in separate elections. The premier is chosen by the
party or parties that wins control of the parliament.
   Rocard was appointed Tuesday because Chirac resigned.
   Because his party does not control Parliament, Rocard must form
a government with support from outside the Socialist ranks.
Mitterrand, who is beginning his second seven-year term as
president, has said non-Socialists would be included in the Cabinet.
   The change of government formally ends ``cohabitation,'' as the
French call the uneasy sharing of power by a president and premier
of opposing political views.
   It also marked the first time in 30 years of the Fifth Republic
that a government does not have a majority in the National
Assembly, which is controlled by center-right parties that backed
Chirac.
   Rocard, 57, is a rival of Mitterrand in the Socialist Party and
was prepared to seek the presidency this year until Mitterrand
declared his candidacy.
   As a non-doctrinaire Socialist, however, the former agriculture
minister symbolizes the president's effort to appeal to a broader
segment of the public.
   Mitterrand, 71, profited from a divided right and won 56 percent
of the vote in Sunday's election.
   Presenting himself as unifier of the nation, he won over some
centrist politicians who were upset with Chirac's attempts to
accommodate the far right.
   All but renouncing his Socialist past, the president has
promised a policy of ``enlargement'' that is broad enough to
satisfy centrists previously aligned with the right but does not
alienate the left.
   Jacques Barrot, secretary-general of the Social Democratic
Center, one of the parties in the center-right coalition that
backed Chirac, said Tuesday that Rocard's performance would be
judged ``without preconceptions.''
   ``For us centrists, France's situation and the challenges it
must meet demands that no chance for dialogue be overlooked,'' he
said. ``One must recognize his (Rocard's) merit in certain
situations and his courage when he tried to pull the left out of
its dogmatisms and its well-beaten paths.''
   Newspaper commentators and political observers had predicted
Mitterrand's choice for premier would be Rocard, a debonair man
long one of France's favorite politicians.
   He also is known for independent and outspoken views. He
resigned as agriculture minister in 1985 because he opposed a
system of proportional voting instituted by the Socialists.
   Mitterrand, the first French president elected twice by
universal suffrage, has said he will not dissolve the National
Assembly for new elections immediately, but will try to work with
it. His party holds 211 of the 577 seats.
   Some supporters urge that the president call elections quickly
to take advantage of the momentum gained in Sunday's vote.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a major figure in the
center-right Union for French Democracy, has called for a
``constructive opposition.'' Mitterrand won the office from him in
a close election seven years ago.
   A former Socialist premier, Laurent Fabius, said ``I don't think
the French want a return to 1981,'' referring to the Socialist
government that assumed power that year.
   ``They are for an enlargement,'' he said in a radio interview.
``Excellent things were done in 1981, but time has passed and
society has changed.
   ``The left is no longer an experiment. This is a change with
incredible historic dimensions.''

<HEAD>U.S. Retaliates Against Singapore for Removing U.S. Diplomat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States asked Singapore on Tuesday
to remove the political officer from its embassy in retaliation for
similar action the East Asian nation took last week against an
American diplomat.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Singapore was
requested to withdraw Robert H.H. Chua, first secretary at the
embassy. Redman expressed ``hope that we can put this unfortunate
episode behind us.''
   The tit-for-tat withdrawals started last week when Singapore
insisted that E. Mason Hendrickson, an American embassy officer, be
removed on grounds he had interfered in the domestic affairs of the
country.
   Singapore had charged that Hendrickson met with lawyers opposed
to the government of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to urge them to
run for election and to suggest that financing would be available.
   Redman said the allegations were ``totally without foundation,''
but that the United States was compelled to withdraw Hendrickson in
keeping with international law that gives nations the right to
decide who may be accredited as diplomats.
   ``The United States values highly its ties with Singapore, which
we have regarded as among our strongest friends in East Asia,''
Redman said. ``We are therefore both shocked and puzzled at the
allegations which have been made against us, and which, as I have
noted, we reject in toto.
   The State Department made no charges against Chua, whose
position in the Singapore Embassy was roughly comparable to the
post held in Singapore by Hendrickson.
   Under the diplomatic concept of ``reciprocity,'' nations that
feel their diplomats have been treated unfairly often respond by
taking parallel action.

<TEXT>
   NBC regained first place in the Nielsen
ratings as the three major networks, in a bow to the May sweeps,
ran mostly original programming last week.
   NBC won by a wide margin and took the top nine places, a feat*unequalled
since CBS was first the week ending Nov. 3, 1980.
   ``Cheers'' was in first place and the only non-NBC show to make
the Top 10 was ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   The abundance of original programming is due to the May sweeps,
a period in which the audiences of local television stations are
measured to set their advertising rates.
   Many series episodes, as well as movies and miniseries, were
held back for the sweeps. But the new shows will run out soon as
the lengthening writers' strike takes its toll on summer shows
planned by the networks to freshen up the rerun season.
   An NBC movie and the first half of a miniseries also made the
Top 10. ``The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story'' was
seventh and the opener of ``Something Is Out There'' was ninth.
   The first half of ABC's ``The Bourne Identity'' placed 11th. It
combined with its Sunday competitor on NBC ``Something Is Out
There'' to knock CBS' ``The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' to 58th
place.
   NBC took the week ended May 8 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey
with an average rating of 15.6. CBS, which had been first last
week, followed with 11.5 and ABC was third with 11.2. The rating is
a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with
television.
   In the separate sweeps measurements, NBC took over first place
from CBS, which got an enormous boost last week from the final
episode of ``Magnum, P.I.'' Here are the ratings in the Nielsen
sweeps for April 28-May 8: NBC 14.9, CBS 13.1, ABC 10.4. Here are
the ratings for the Arbitron sweeps for April 27-May 8: NBC 14.8,
CBS 12.9, ABC 10.7.
   ``The Cosby Show'' was the only show in the Top 10 that was not
original. In fact, it was the only rerun in the top 36 shows of the
ratings. Even below that, more than half of the shows are new.
   Here's the Top 10: ``Cheers,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Night
Court,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``L.A. Law,'' NBC
Monday Movie, ``The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson
Story,'' ``Amen,'' NBC Sunday Movie, ``Something Is Out There,''
Part I, all NBC, and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   A cliffhanger episode of NBC's ``Miami Vice,'' which returned to
its old time period of 10 p.m. Friday, was in 23rd place.
   The CBS movie ``Necessity'' was 22nd and the second half of the
ABC miniseries ``The Richest Man in the World: The Story of
Aristotle Onassis'' was 27th. A new production on CBS of ``The
Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' was 58th and ABC's ``Remembering
Marilyn,'' a documentary on Marilyn Monroe, was 60th.
   Once again, ABC's ``Max Headroom'' was the lowest-rated network
show.
   Here are the five bottom shows: ABC's ``Buck James,'' ABC's
``Hotel,'' CBS' ``Houston Knights,'' ABC's ``Ohara'' and ABC's
``Max Headroom.''
   ABC remained first among the evening news shows. CBS was second
again and NBC was third. The ratings: ABC 10.2, CBS 9.3, NBC 8.6.

   Gov. Bob Martinez on Tuesday signed a
law prohibiting people from drinking alcoholic beverages while
traveling in most vehicles.
   ``Certainly this is a quantum jump in making the highways
safer,'' Martinez said.
   The law takes effect Oct. 1. Drivers caught thereafter with open
containers of alcohol will be subject to $52 fines and having
points assessed on their licenses. Passengers would be subject to
$32 fines.
   Drivers or passengers could be cited if the open container were
found anywhere within their reach. An opened container of alcohol
would be legal if kept lock a separate compartment or the trunk.
   Backers of the law have for years expressed outrage that Florida
law let drivers and passengers drink alcoholic beverages while
driving even though the state has tough laws against drunken
driving.
   ``It was just a combination of the pressure back home and the
carnage on the highways,'' said Sen. Don Childers, who sponsored
the Senate version of the bill. ``It's ludicrous for us to have
tough DUI laws on our statute books and yet still allow someone to
drink and drive in this state.''
   However, exempt from the new law will be passengers in a hired
vehicle, such as a bus or limousine, or in a recreational vehicle
longer than 21 feet.
   ``Sometimes in getting a law passed certain stipulations are
inserted,'' noted Martinez. ``I think this is something that is
going to require monitoring. If motor homes, all of a sudden, end
up with a higher accident rate I think this is something that will
have to be revisited.''

<HEAD>Pappas Received Anonymous Threatening Note</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Roy Dyson's top aide, Tom Pappas,
received an anonymous threatening note six weeks before his
apparent suicide, a spokeswoman for the congressman said Tuesday.
   The message said, ``You can be sure that the fun and games you
are having in your boss' office will catch up with you soon. There
will be a fall,'' according to a copy provided by Katie Tucker, who
replaced Pappas as administrative assistant to Dyson, D-Md.
   Pappas apparently leaped to his death from a hotel room in New
York on May 1, the same day the Washington Post reported on
unorthodox social demands Pappas made of male staff members under
his supervision in Dyson's office.
   Some of the sources for the Post story were disgruntled former
Dyson workers, and Tucker said the note had been determined by the
FBI to have also been the work of an ``aggrieved employee.'' The
FBI concluded that the note did not represent a direct threat, she
said.
   The note to Pappas, received March 15, concluded: ``You have
lost sight of your purpose and have become a monster.'' Attached
was a newspaper clipping of a brief story about new appeal rights
for congressional employees who are suspended or fired.
   Tucker said that, together with an uncanceled stamp on the
envelope the message came in, lead her to believe the note came
from one of two or three former Dyson employees who still work
elsewhere on Capitol Hill.
   She said the New York City police, who are investigating Pappas'
apparent suicide, also have widened their probe to include the
note. The FBI's Washington field office still has an open case on
the matter, she said.
   Existence of the note was first reported this week by the
Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, and also was reported Tuesday by
The Washington Times.
   Dyson told the newspaper that he believed a disgruntled employee
also was responsible for instigating a Federal Election Commission
investigation of alleged misreporting of Pappas' income.

   Anti-communist guerrillas pounded the
Afghan capital's residential neighborhoods with rockets, a radio
station reported Tuesday, while diplomatic sources said rebels
closed in on the country's second largest city.
   Monday evening's bombardment of Kabul with 17 surface-to-surface
rockets killed 23 civilians and wounded 28 people, Afghan radio
said.
   Western diplomatic sources said Indian diplomats had fled
Afghanistan's second largest city, Kandahar, as the rebels overran
security zones in heavy fighting near the southeastern provincial
capital. Its population has dwindled from 200,000 to 20,000 as
people fled the eight-year civil war.
   The capture of Kandahar would represent a major defeat for the
forces of President Najib, who has vowed to defend his
Soviet-backed government after Moscow withdraws an estimated
115,000 troops from Afghanistan under an April 14 accord.
   However, the government commands only about 50,000 troops of its
own, and the Pakistani-based guerrilla forces number about 200,000.
   The Afghan radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said Tuesday
that one rocket roared into a house in southern Kabul, killing five
members of a family. Six people were killed in a playground in the
center of the capital, it said.
   The report also said some victims were returning home from work.
   The ruling Communist Party condemned the rocket attacks Tuesday,
describing them as ``crimes committed by the enemies of peace and
peace-loving citizens,'' the broadcast said.
   Interior Minister Gen. Mohammad Gulabzoi appealed to people to
cooperate with the government in ``preventing enemy actions.''
   Soviet forces have begun handing over security to Kabul's troops
as Moscow prepares for its pullout beginning May 15.
   Soviet soldiers reportedly had increased security in the face of
intense fighting last week in the Panjshir Valley located between
Kabul and the Hindukush range.
   Diplomats, citing colleagues in Kabul, said nightly Soviet
transport flights at Kabul airports remained heavy, indicating a
massive resupply of Afghan forces.
   Medical staff at Kabul hospitals were reporting a near-record
number of land mine casualties, including refugees and other
civilians.
   Guerrilla leaders estimate there are 5.5 million land mines
spread around Afghanistan.
   Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 to back
the Afghan government in its war with the guerrillas.
   On April 22, the guerrillas captured a major Soviet-Afghan
garrison at Barikot, just a few steps from the Pakistan frontier.
It opened a key new supply route for insurgents operating east,
north and west of Kabul.
   On Sunday, they claimed to have captured another government
post, Chamkani, nine miles west of the Pakistan border in Paktia
province.

   About 30,000 senior citizens came to Detroit on
Tuesday to flex their growing political muscle in the 1988 biennial
convention of the American Association of Retired Persons.
   Thousands of people gathered in Cobo Hall to hear speeches by
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, sex therapist Ruth Westheimer, Peace
Corps Director Loret Ruppe and U.S. Sen. Donald Riegle of Michigan.
The convention runs through Thursday.
   But many conventioneers from across the country came to look at
exhibits of motor homes and vacation spots, exercise devices and
medications.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Sophie Grudzinski of Hobart, Ind. ``But
all these freebies, we just can't pass it up.''
   She and Mary Bentley of Lake Station, Ind., were part of a
two-bus contingent coming from the Gary, Ind., area to the
cnvention on Detroit's sprawling riverfront convention center.
   ``I'm tired, I could use a little scooter,'' Mrs. Bentley said
while relaxing near a stage in the main exhibit hall where
entertainment was about to begin.
   While here, the two women and thousands of others had the
opportunity to attend seminars and hear speeches on consumer
``rip-offs'' and patient rights, the federal budget and sexuality
among seniors by Westheimer.
   During the convention, delegates will vote on a number of
resolutions that are not binding on the AARP's 3,600 local
chapters. The organization will issue no political endorsements.
   But Mrs. Grudzinski said she didn't agree with the national
organization's non-partisan policy.
   ``There's so many of us,'' she said, ``that if we'd all stick
together, we could really get things done.''
   Nader told a room packed with more than 2,000 conventioneers
that they should watch out for fraud in prosthetic devices,
telephone solicitations, prepared food and pharmaceuticals.
   Ruppe told a group there were opportunities for senior citizens
in the Peace Corps. She said Odilon Long just retired from the
Peace Corps at 86, leaving 76-year-old Janet Klepper in Guatemala
as the oldest volunteer.
   She said the proportion of senior citizens in the Peace Corps
has risen from 6 percent in 1961 to 12 percent now.
   ``Age is respected in countries where we work,'' she said,
adding that senior citizens' biggest problem with acceptance in the
program is health, and a difficulty in learning a foreign language.
   ``At the present moment, most of our seniors are serving in
English-speaking countries,'' she said.
   Riegle, who is running for re-election as the state's senior
senator in Washington, repeated his call for President Reagan to
sign recently debated trade legislation and to break the Social
Security system out of the federal budget process.

   U.S. fishermen landed a record catch of 6.9
billion pounds of fish and shellfish last year, breaking the
previous record of 6.5 billion pounds set in 1980, the government
said Tuesday.
   The 1987 catch, valued at $3.1 billion, was up 865 million
pounds from the 1986 total of 6 billion pounds, worth $2.8 billion,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
   Fishermen received an average of 45 cents a pound for their fish
last year.
   American fishermen who land their catches at ports outside the
United States or sold their fish at sea in joint venture operations
harvested an additional 4.1 billion pounds, worth $454 million, in
1987.
   The government said increased catches of menhaden, at 2.7
billion pounds, and Alaska pollock, at 552 million pounds,
contributed to the 1987 increase. The Alaska pollock catch was up
323 percent over 1986. Landings of tuna, Pacific cod, crabs and
scallops were also up.
   The shrimp harvest fell from 400.2 million pounds in 1986 to
363.1 million pounds, worth $578 million, last year.
   Louisiana led all states in volume with a catch of 1.8 billion
pounds. It was followed by Alaska, with 1.7 billion pounds;
Virginia, 709.6 million pounds; California, 451.7 million pounds,
and Mississippi, 436.7 million pounds.
   By value, Alaska was first with a catch of $941.7 million,
followed by Louisiana, $315.9 million; Massachusetts, $278.9
million; Texas, $199.7 million and California, $173.2 million.
   Worldwide, fishermen landed a record 203.3 billion pounds. Japan
leads the world with 13 percent of the total catch, followed by the
Soviet Union, with 12 percent; China, 9 percent; Peru and Chile, 6
percent each,and the United States, 5 percent.

<HEAD>Personnel Changes May Affect Communist Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Hungary's increasingly
divided Communist Party met Tuesday to discuss reforms that may
affect top-level officials as pressure mounted for the party's
leader to resign.
   The party's Central Committee cited ``personnel changes'' as one
of two items on the agenda of a May 20 session of the Communist
Party, according to a communique issued at the end of the one-day
session.
   The meeting focused on a draft document on political and
economic changes authored by party leader Janos Kadar, according to
the official news agency MTI.
   Kadar, who turns 76 on May 26, has been blamed by party
loyalists and dissidents alike for Hungary's economic crisis and
his apparent reluctance to endorse sweeping political reform.
   Premier Karoly Grosz, a leading contender for Kadar's position,
has said the political future of the party boss may be up for
debate at a national party conference May 20-22.
   Kadar has led the party since Moscow quashed an anti-Soviet
uprising in 1956. He has said he would step down if asked, but has
given little indication he intends to relinquish control soon.
   Tuesday's meeting was to elect a special committee that will
deal with personnel matters at the conference, Grosz told reporters
while on a visit to Britain last week.
   ``In the event that some 1,000 delegates attending the
conference decide that personnel changes are necessary, and if
these changes include the person of Janos Kadar, he will accept the
decision,'' Grosz said on Friday, according to MTI.
   Last month, four outspoken advocates of political reform and
dialogue with non-party activists were abruptly expelled from the
Communist ranks.
   That move was seen as a sign that Kadar and his followers, who
are reportedly locked in a debate over who should retire first,
still wield clout among the nation's 880,000 Communists.
   However, pressure is growing for Kadar's resignation, with
younger party officials anxious to assume power and citizens
complaining about government austerity measures.
   With a foreign debt of more than $17 billion, this nation of
10.6 million people has Eastern Europe's highest per capita debt.
   Inflation is running at more than 15 percent, and is likely to
go higher following a decision April 1 to liberalize state controls
on 80 percent of Hungary's retail prices.
   The draft paper for the May 20 conference goes far in dealing
with these complaints. In it, the Communist party formally accepts
blame for the current economic hardships and considers granting
limited political reforms such as secret ballots and limited terms
in party office.
   But some critics of the paper have demanded that party members
stick rigidly to Communist policy in public statements.
   The demand is seen as an attack on leading reformist Imre
Pozsgay, a member of the Central Committee and the Communist
establishment's foremost proponent of reform.
   Pozsgay has said he found support in Moscow for his ideas and
wants to see the government initiate referendums for change, as
well as guarantee independence in Hungarian for special interest
groups.
   The arguments of reformists like Pozsgay have been bolstered in
recent months by the growing number of economists who are
advocating market reforms as the only way out of Hungary's growing
economic crisis.

<HEAD>DeSillers Calls Fund Charges `Crazy'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A court-appointed official found Maria DeSillers
misspent up to $200,000 collected for her son's unsuccessful liver
transplants, but she angrily denied the charges Tuesday, calling
them ``crazy.''
   Ms. DeSillers' 7-year-old son, Ronnie, died at Children's
Hospital in Pittsburgh last year after a highly publicized
fund-raising drive that included a $1,000 donation from President
Reagan.
   Karen Geivers, appointed at the request of the Dade state
attorney's office to review Ms. DeSillers' spending, cited a series
of questionable expenses paid from the donations.
   Among the payments were $10,850 to a jewelry store, $23,700 to
Ms. DeSillers' ex-boyfriend, and $96,527 in cash withdrawals for
personal expenses.
   At an appeal Tuesday before a state administrative examiner over
a $1,000 state fine levied on Ms. DeSillers, Timothy Jansen of the
Florida Secretary of State's Office accused her of misleading the
public.
   ``I don't think that the people who donated money intended that
the money for Ronnie should go for cars, the rent, jewelry and
certain other expenditures,'' Jansen told hearing examiner Donald
Alexander. ``We cannot allow people to raise money for one purpose
and go against that purpose for personal benefit.''
   Alexander will take the testimony and documents under
consideration and make a decision on the fine within 30 days, said
Ms. DeSillers' attorney Harry Robbins.
   After the hearing, Ms. DeSiller's lashed out at the report.
   ``I'm not saying I'm perfect,'' she said. ``But ... how could
she say on there that I know the law and I disregarded it. It's
crazy.''
   The report by Ms. Geivers acknowledged that Ms. DeSillers had
suffered a ``great personal tragedy'' with her son's death.
   But it added ``she appears to have ignored the laws ... when it
suited her purposes to do so.''
   Ms. DeSillers has said the questionable expenditures were
necessary to raise money for an organ donation awareness program.
   She said some of the money went to help her keep up a
``professional appearance'' while soliciting funds as president of
the now-dormant Ronnie DeSillers National Foundation.
   And she said the jewelry expense was to buy back items she had
pawned to pay Ronnie's medical expenses and payments to her brother
and boyfriend Jose Castillo were to repay loans.
   ``Jose spent more than twice that helping Ronnie and I,'' she
said. ``He lost two businesses when he came to Pittsburgh.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's 1988 harvests could produce
215 million metric tons of grain, up 2 percent from last year's
bumper output of 211.4 million tons, the Agriculture Department
said Tuesday.
   In its first forecast of this year's Soviet grain production,
the USDA said the harvests could include 92 million tons of wheat,
109 million tons of coarse grains such as rye, barley, oats and
corn; and 14 million tons of miscellaneous grains and pulses, which
include peas and beans.
   The report said the harvest outlook could mean a cutback in
grain imports, particularly wheat. The United States has been
selling the Soviets huge quantities of wheat lately, all of it at
subsidized prices under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   If the 1988 harvest turns out as forecast, it would be the third
straight year that Soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million
tons, an unprecedented feat in that country.
   It also would be the third-largest Soviet grain output, exceeded
by the record crop of 237.4 million tons in 1978 and the 1976
harvest of 223.8 million tons.
   Officials said the 1988 forecast is ``highly tentative'' and
that it ``will be modified as the season progresses by both
positive and negative factors, including weather developments.''
   Total grain area was estimated at 116 million hectares, slightly
more than last year's 115.2 million hectares.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn. One hectare is equal to about
2.47 acres.
   ``The improved outlook for the 1988 U.S.S.R. grain crop,
particularly wheat, is expected to reduce total grain import needs
in 1988-89,'' the report said. ``This year's coarse grain crop is
projected at 109 million tons, somewhat below last year's large
harvest.''
   Therefore, it said, total Soviet wheat imports could decline to
15 million tons in the international marketing year that begins on
July 1 from 22 million tons in 1987-88. That would be the lowest
level in nine years.
   But imports of coarse grain, at a forecast of 10 million tons in
1988-89, would be about the same as the last two years.
   Total grain imports, including wheat, coarse grains and
miscellaneous grains, could fall to 26 million tons in 1988-89 from
32.5 million tons this season.
   Analysts said much will depend on the quality of the Soviet's
1988 wheat harvest and how competively priced lower-quality feed
wheat is relative to other grains used for livestock feed.
   In 1986, when the Soviet Union last harvested 92 million tons of
wheat _ the 1987 crop was 83.3 million tons _ it included much
low-quality grain, which prompted large imports of higher quality
U.S. wheat.
   A similar problem with poor quality in the 1987 harvest
triggered further imports of higher quality U.S. wheat, all of it
sold at subsidized prices under EEP arrangements.
   Moreover, the United States and the Soviet Union are still
negotiating a long-term grain agreement to replace the current
five-year pact that expires on Sept. 30. The agreement would
continue the practice of specifying minimum amounts of U.S. wheat
and corn to be bought by the Soviets each year.

<TEXT>
   Richard S. Caliguiri was eulogized Tuesday as
a Renaissance man whose love affair with Pittsburgh made him one of
the city's most popular mayors.
   ``The media has reminded us frequently that Dick Caliguiri was
slight of build and stature. But when the history of this city is
written, Mayor Caliguiri's chapters deserve to be titled, `The
Years of the Giant,''' Bishop Anthony G. Bosco told about 1,800
mourners at St. Paul Cathedral.
   ``I cannot remember another Pittsburgher whose death has
provoked such an outpouring of praise and grief from Republicans
and Democrats, from old and young, from black and white, from rich
and poor, from captains of industry and from street people. All are
in mourning.''
   Caliguiri died Friday from what his doctors said was an
accumulation of protein caused by the rare disease amyloidosis. He
was 56 and in his 12th year as mayor.
   ``With the slight but commanding figure of Dick at the wheel we
felt safe,'' Bosco said. ``Because he was a strong leader and a
visionary we have seen his beloved city grow into a proud
metropolis. Its skyline is bold and proud, and Dick Caliguiri was
the genius, the driving force, the architect, the builder. He was
truly the Renaissance man.''
   ``His vision encompassed more than steel and stones,'' said
Rabbi Walter Jacob, one of several clerics who offered eulogies.
``It reached us all in our neighborhoods.''
   Erie Mayor Louis J. Tullio, 71, who also suffers from the fatal
disease, was one of several dozen dignitaries attending the funeral
Mass. Tullio and Caliguiri discovered last year that they suffered
from amyloidosis.
   Gov. Robert Casey; Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode; the state's
two U.S. senators, John Heinz and Arlen Specter; and Sophie
Masloff, the City Council president who was named mayor following
Caliguiri's death, attended the service.
   Caliguiri's widow, Jeanne, was accompanied by their two sons,
Gregg, 19, and Dave, 15; Caliguiri's only sister, Virginia
Caliguiri; his father, Chris, and the late mayor's bodyguard.
   The sons read passages from the Bible.
   Corporate and academic leaders, including Pittsburgh Pirates
General Manager Syd Thrift and Pirates President Carl Barger, were
scattered throughout the spacious gothic cathedral.
   Baskets of white gladioluses adorned the altar, and an ivory
cloth with a gold cross covered the casket. A chamber music
ensemble, bell ringers and soloists added to the organ music for
the 1{-hour service.
   The service ended with the ringing of a large firebell 11 times,
one of every year Caliguiri was in office, as eight of the mayor's
relatives carried the casket from the church. A color guard of city
firefighters and police officers led the procession.
   Caliguiri was buried two plots away from his mother, Catherine,
in Calvary Cemetery in Pittsburgh following brief prayers in a
cemetery chapel.

<HEAD>Consumer Interests Lose Opening Skirmish Over House Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer interests lost the opening skirmish
Tuesday in House committee action on a politically sensitive bill
that they fear will make it harder for victims injured by unsafe
products to recover damages from manufacturers.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, taking the first votes
on the product liability bill after months of internal wrangling,
decisively defeated two consumer-backed amendments offered by Rep.
Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., and then adjourned until Thursday.
   The bill would provide a uniform federal standard of product
liability sought by the business community to pre-empt conflicting
state laws. Consumer activists vigorously oppose the measure on the
ground that it would jeopardize the legal rights of victims of
hazardous consumer products.
   Much of the first day of committee debate focused on complex
legal questions raised by what Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., called
a ``complex and extremely controversial'' bill. Its chances of
passage in an election year are considered highly unlikely.
   A similar bill died in the Senate in late 1986 after a
filibuster led by Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., the Senate Commerce
Committee chairman who remains a staunch foe of any such
legislation.
   At the request of Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House panel, Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., drafted a plan aimed at
making a compromise bill approved by Florio's subcommittee last
December more palatable to consumer groups and moderate committee
Democrats.
   But Synar's amendments drew sniping from all sides Tuesday,
prompting Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., to predict a flood of
proposed changes that might include some ``venomous snakes''
further threatening the bill's prospects.
   ``This is a watered-down bill, but it is better than none,''
said Rep. Norman Lent of New York, the committee's ranking
Republican.
   Waxman, charging that ``we are about to emasculate the product
liability system,'' proposed to expand the bill's narrow list of
federal legal grounds for damage suits by consumers against
manufacturers of defective products.
   Waxman's two proposed amendments to the Synar plan were rejected
on roll call votes of 29-12 and 30-12, with Dingell voting both
times with opponents.
   Under the subcommittee bill, originally introduced by Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M., a manufacturer could escape liability for
damages if he did not know _ or could not know _ of a design defect
with knowledge ``reasonably available'' to him, or if there were no
feasible alternative design.
   This restriction on liability would not apply if the consumer
could establish that the product was egregiously unsafe, that an
ordinary consumer would not know of the product's risks and if the
product had little or no usefulness.
   The Synar plan would require only that the plaintiff prove that
the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it
should not have been marketed. Synar also would put the burden of
proof on the manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be
discovered and that an alternative design was not feasible.
   Leaders of four consumer organizations wrote Dingell on April 27
to complain that the Synar plan ``still falls far short of
protecting the legal rights of individuals injured by unreasonably
dangerous and defective products.''
   They said Synar's amendments would weaken the legal doctrine of
``strict liability'' used by most states. That doctrine shifts the
focus of a liability trial from the manufacturer's alleged
misconduct to the product itself, relieving the courts of proving
what a manufacturer knew or should have known about its product.
   In a separate May 2 letter to each committee member, the
consumer groups said the bill would make it ``more difficult, and
in some cases impossible, for victims of defective products to
recover their losses from those responsible for such defects,'' and
would reduce manufacturers' incentives to produce safer products.

   President Reagan said Tuesday he has not ruled
out pardoning former aides Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter
for any crimes in the Iran-Contra affair, but he indicated he would
not do it before a verdict in their trials.
   Reagan responded with an emphatic ``no'' when asked by a
reporter whether he had ruled out granting pardons to North and
Poindexter.
   He did not elaborate, simply turning and walking from the White
House's Roosevelt Room, where he had presented the Presidential
Medal of Freedom to Britain's Lord Carrington for his work as NATO
secretary general.
   Reagan's comment came one day after he told an interviewer that
it would be wrong to grant any pardons before the trial is over,
and suggested he would be out of office when that happens.
   Previously, the president has hinted he is leaning toward a
pardon for North and Poindexter, saying he did not think they were
guilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater went to the Oval Office
to consult with Reagan about his remark Tuesday. Afterward,
Fitzwater said the president had understood the question and gave
the answer he wanted.
   ``It means there's been no decision'' on pardons, Fitzwater
said. ``I wouldn't assume that any definitive judgment has been
made.''
   Fitzwater made public Reagan's response when syndicated
columnist Carl Rowan asked him in an interview Monday whether he
would pardon North and Poindexter.
   ``You can't consider that, Carl, until this case has been
closed, whichever way it's going to go,'' the president said. ``To
pardon somebody before trial leaves a sense of guilt around them, a
cloud of guilt for the rest of time. And so this is something that
I don't have to face.''
   The timing of the Iran-Contra trial is uncertain. U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has said he would like to start as early as
June, though lawyers for North and Poindexter have said they would
like to delay it until next year.
   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has proposed starting the
trial in September. Reagan's term ends next Jan. 20.
   Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser, and
North, a former National Security Council staff member, have been
charged along with arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim
with conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms
sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Gesell on Tuesday ordered that Hakim and Secord be allowed to
examine thousands of pages of especially sensitive government
documents that may be relevant to their defense.
   Government security officials had refused to allow either
defendant to inspect the sensitive material. Hakim, an Iranian-born
U.S. citizen, has never had a security clearance; Secord, a retired
Air Force major general, has not been cleared for access to
classified information since he left the government several years
ago.
   But the judge ruled that ``no basis exists for depriving either
of these defendants of their right to determine the relevance and
materiality of classified materials involved in this case.''
   Lawyers for Secord and Hakim, however, waived their clients'
right to inspect between 35 and 70 sensitive documents to verify
prosecution claims the material is irrelevant to the case.

<HEAD>Saudis Refuse To Allow U.S. To Inspect Chinese Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has refused to allow the United
States to inspect the missiles the Saudis bought secretly from
China in 1986, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy said
Tuesday.
   But Murphy also said the United States was ``completely
satisfied'' with assurances given by China and the Saudis that the
missiles would not be equipped with nuclear or chemical warheads.
   He told a congressional hearing the assurances were made both
orally and in a letter from Saudi King Fahd to President Reagan.
   Despite those assurances, the United States still would like to
inspect the missile sites and was continuing to discuss that
possibility with the Saudis, Murphy said. But another U.S.
official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said he was
doubtful the Saudis would change their minds.
   Defense analysts argue that the conventional missiles could be
converted easily for use as nuclear or chemical arms. But Murphy
told the hearing that by agreeing last month to sign the
International Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Saudi Arabia was
precluding the missiles' conversion to nuclear weapons.
   Murphy conceded, in response to questioning, that U.S.
intelligence agencies had failed to detect the 1986 deal for the
sale of the CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles which have a range of
up to 1,800 miles.
   ``We had no firm fix on it until January (1988) and nothing
definite until March,'' he told a joint hearing of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East and the
subcommittee on arms control, international security and science.
   The Chinese missiles being deployed in the Saudi desert are not
accurate weapons and ``in our view, they also do not improve the
security of Saudi Arabia. But the Saudis feel differently,
particularly in view of the threat from Iran,'' Murphy said.
   Saudi Arabia and Iran have been at odds for several years and
the tensions culminated last month in the Saudi decision to cut off
diplomatic ties with Tehran.
   Murphy was testifying on behalf of the administration's proposal
to sell the Saudis a $325 million package of maintenance and
training for U.S.-made AWACS radar surveillance planes. The five
planes were supplied to the Saudis last year under a 1981 contract.
   Murphy also was lobbying for the sale of 200 Bradley fighting
vehicles, equipped with anti-tank TOW missiles, worth $500 million.
   Murphy said Saudi Arabia had warned the United States that if
Congress rejects the sale, the Saudis ``will go elsewhere.'' He
noted that when Congress turned down the sale of F-15 fighter jets
to Saudi Arabia in 1985, the Saudis signed a $12 billion contract
with Britain for Tornado fighters.
   ``We lost business and influence,'' Murphy said.
   He said Saudi Arabia uses the U.S.-supplied AWACS for aerial
patrols to protect American naval forces against Iranian attacks in
the Persian Gulf. The Saudis also allow the United States access to
their ports and air bases, and provide F-15 fighter jet protection
for U.S. AWACS flights over the northern part of the gulf, he said.
   The two sales before Congress ``are clearly in the interest of
the United States,'' he said.
   More than 180 members of the House and 58 Senators have asked
Secretary of State George P. Shultz to block the Saudi sales
pending clarifications of the Chinese missile purchase.

<TEXT>
   An organization representing the nation's home
builders said Tuesday it expected 1.5 million new homes to be
started this year, down from 1987 but still a ``reasonably good''
showing.
   Dale Stuard, president of the National Association of Home
Builders, said single family homes would account for 1.1 million
starts in 1988, with multifamily homes accounting for about 400,000
starts.
   Stuard said the forecast represented ``a reasonably good year.''
The 1988 projection was a decrease from 1987, which had 1,621,000
starts.
   Stuard said the industry did not foresee a recession this year
but continued to be concerned about rising interest rates,
inflation and the impact of the 1986 tax law, which he said had hit
the housing industry particularly hard.
   The organization, which has 160,000 members, plans to lobby on
Capitol Hill this week for its legislative agenda.

<HEAD>Winter Wheat Crop Reported at 1.62 Billion Bushels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers soon will be harvesting a winter wheat
crop estimated at 1.62 billion bushels, up 4 percent from last
year's production, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The first forecast of the season, based on surveys May 1,
compared with a 1987 winter wheat output of 1.56 billion bushels.
The average yield was estimated at 40.7 bushels per harvested acre,
up from last year's 39.8 bushels per acre.
   Farmers are expected to have about 39.8 million acres for
harvest this year, up 1 percent from 39.3 million in 1987, the
report said.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production.
   No 1988 production estimates for spring wheat, corn and other
major spring-planted crops were included. Those will be issued by
USDA later in the growing season.
   The outlook for wheat prices at the farm also has brightened,
reflecting brisk export demand and a reduction in once-awesome U.S.
wheat stockpiles.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, USDA projected total
wheat production this year, based on historical trends, at 2.17
billion bushels, up slightly from 2.1 billion bushels in 1987. That
would include winter wheat and other kinds planted this spring for
harvest in 1988.
   The report also projected the U.S. wheat stockpile to decline
further to around 796 million bushels by the end of the coming
marketing year on May 31, 1989, compared with more than 1.23
billion bushels of old-crop wheat expected to be carried over this
June 1.
   Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Asssociation of Wheat Growers, said the expected reduction in U.S.
wheat inventories will mean tighter supplies in the year ahead.
   Does that mean the United States is running low on wheat after
the recent years of huge surpluses?
   ``That's relatively correct,'' Schwensen said. ``And if we're
going to stay in the world (export) market, we're going to have to
have adequate supplies for our customers. That's why we feel the
acreage reserve level can be relaxed and farmers can have the
opportunity to market more bushels in the 1989 season.''
   Schwensen referred to a farm law provision that limits USDA to
no more than a 20 percent land-idling requirement when the wheat
stockpile is projected to drop below a billion bushels. At a
projected 796 million bushels on May 31, 1989, that would be well
below the mark.
   For the last two years, USDA has required wheat farmers to idle
27.5 percent of their base acreage in order to qualify for supports
and other federal benefits. Schwensen said the association wants to
see the 1989 requirement reduced to between 10 percent and 20
percent.
   Wheat market prices were projected for 1988-89 at an average
range of $2.80 to $3.20 per bushel, compared with $2.55 estimated
for 1987-88.
   The indicated production of winter wheat, based on May 1,
prospects, are listed here. The first numbers show the total
production in thousands of bushels. The second numbers are the
average yields per acre for the major states.

<HEAD>Dukakis Accepts Secret Service Protection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Front-running Democrat Michael S. Dukakis said
Tuesday he will begin using Secret Service protection after relying
for more than a year on local police on the presidential campaign
trail.
   The Massachusetts governor said there have been no incidents or
threats that prompted the change. However, he said, ``there comes a
point in all of this when Secret Service protection is necessary,
and in my judgment I've arrived at that point.''
   Campaign aides said the timing was the result of several
considerations, including Dukakis' increasing prominence near the
end of what has become a two-man Democratic race with Jesse Jackson.
   In addition, aides said there was some concern inside the
campaign about the potential for violence in California,
particularly in light of recent publicity marking 20 years since
the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy after his victory in the
1968 California Democratic primary.
   The protection, provided round the clock at taxpayer expense, is
to begin Wednesday when Dukakis leaves for a campaign trip through
New Jersey and Washington, D.C., en route to California.
   The governor told reporters at a Statehouse briefing that he met
recently with Secret Service agents to review procedures.
   ``They understand my lifestyle and the fact that we don't have
governor's mansions in this state,'' Dukakis said, stressing his
concern for his and his family's privacy.
   Asked if reporters would continue to enjoy access to the
candidate, Dukakis said, ``I certainly hope so. ... I don't know
why it should change.''
   ``Kitty and I have been very, very lucky. For 25 years we've
been deeply involved in public life, and we've been able to do it
with a remarkably normal personal and family life,'' he said.
   Dukakis promised to continue riding the trolley to work from his
home in suburban Brookline.
   Jackson has had Secret Service protection for months, and Vice
President George Bush, the apparent Republican nominee, has been
protected throughout his term.

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces Sale Of Maritime Patrol Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon notified Congress on Tuesday that
it had approved the sale of three P-3C Orion maritime surveillance
planes to Pakistan.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said Pakistan would be allowed to purchase the three aircraft along
with spare parts, ground support facilities and training services
for an estimated $240 million.
   The Orion is a propeller-driven plane used by the U.S. Navy for
long-range sea patrols and the detection of submarines.
   The announced sale of three of the planes comes just two months
after neighboring India _ Pakistan's arch foe _ leased a
nuclear-powered attack submarine from the Soviet Union.
   According to Pentagon sources, India already had eight
Soviet-made Foxtrot diesel submarines, which date to the 1960s; two
newer Russian Kilo diesel subs, and two advanced West Germany
diesel submarines known as HDW Type 209's.
   The Pentagon insisted in a statement that the sale of the P-3s
to Pakistan ``will not affect the basic military balance in the
region.'' But it added: ``This purchase will permit Pakistan to
enhance its surveillance and anti-submarine and anti-surface
warfare capabilities.''
   The Pentagon said the prime contractors would be the Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Co. in Burbank, Calif., and the General Motors
Corp.'s Detroit Diesel-Allison Gas Turbine division in
Indianapolis, Ind.
   Beyond seeking maritime patrol aircraft, Pakistan also has been
pressing the United States for E-3 AWACS early-warning radar
planes. The United States has countered by suggesting that the
Pakistanis consider the smaller and less expensive E-2C Hawkeye
flown by the Navy.
   Pakistan became interested in an early-warning radar plane
because of repeated incursions by Soviet aircraft into its airspace
near neighboring Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Joe Whitley, a former U.S. attorney who joined
the Justice Department in 1981, is the new principal deputy to
acting Associate Attorney General Francis Keating, it was announced
Tuesday.
   Until last week when Keating arrived from the Treasury
Department, the office of associate attorney general, the No. 3
post in the department, had been staffed with temporary
replacements. Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott left the
department last month to become a federal appeals court judge.
   Whitley, 37, has been a deputy assistant attorney general in the
criminal division since January 1987. He supervised the organized
crime and racketeering section, the narcotic and dangerous drug
section, the office of asset forfeiture and the offices of
legislation, administration and policy and management analysis.
   Whitley was a U.S. attorney in Georgia from 1981 until coming to

<TEXT>
   A five-member Soviet delegation arrived
Tuesday to open talks that could produce a cultural agreement for
signing at the Moscow summit, U.S. officials said.
   The agreement, formally called a ``program document,'' would go
into effect at the end of the year, replacing an accord signed
after the first summit meeting between President Reagan and Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in Geneva in November 1985.
   Charles Z. Wick, head of the U.S. Information Agency, was to
deliver the opening remarks at the start of the talks on Thursday,
said agency spokesman Jan Hemming. The Soviet delegation was to
remain in Washington for a week.
   Soviet officials have said they expect the agreement, which sets
out the specifics of cultural and educational exchanges, to be
ready for the summit.
   U.S. and Soviet officials have said there is little prospect for
an arms control agreement during the summit, which will mark
Reagan's first visit to the land he once called an ``evil empire.''
   U.S. officials were cautious about prospects for a cultural
agreement.
   ``Let's not get our hopes up too high,'' said Joe O'Connell, a
spokesman for USIA, the main American agency involved in the talks.
   ``We would like to see progress in improving relations with the
Soviet Union, but there is no guarantee that a signing of this
document will take place in Moscow,'' said O'Connell. ``What is
important is that by Dec. 31, we have agreed on a solid document
which will advance exchanges between the two countries.''
   The Soviet delegation was headed by Alexei Glukhov, the first
deputy chief of the foreign mininstry department for humanitarian
and cultural relations, said O'Connell.
   Cultural and educational exchanges between the superpowers
slowed to a trickle after the United States, in response to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, allowed an earlier pact to lapse in
1980.
   The exchanges resumed in earnest after the Geneva summit, as
U.S. and Soviet relations improved and Soviet society began to open
up under Gorbachev's reforms. Gorbachev has since announced his
intention to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   In Geneva, the two leaders agreed in principle to sign a
cultural exchange agreement lasting six years, and their aides
worked out a three-year program document that expires at the end of
the year. The envisioned program document would last the additional
three years spelled out in Geneva, O'Connell said.

Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional auditors said Tuesday more than
104,000 retired government workers are paying the price for a 1977
law that curbed Social Security spouse's benefits for civil
servants.
   Most of those retirees have lost all of their Social Security
benefits, according to a report by the General Accounting Office.
   It said Social Security's master beneficiary record for last
January showed that three-quarters of those affected were men.
   Congress adopted the measure to eliminate what lawmakers
regarded as a windfall for civil servants who were not covered
themselves by Social Security, but who wound up receiving benefits
through their spouses.
   The GAO said 104,608 workers had their benefits reduced as a
result of the audit. The agency said 71 percent of the federal
workers checked were drawing an average yearly pension of $16,944.
   Most had their Social Security benefits eliminated entirely,
costing those workers an average of $178 a month or $2,136 a year.
   The law reduces the Social Security spousal or survivor's
benefits of a government retiree by $2 for every $3 of public
pension. It applies only to government workers not covered on their
own jobs by Social Security. Most civil servants _ including all
federal workers hired since 1984 _ are covered by Social Security.
   For most families, Social Security pays spouses' benefits to
elderly husbands or wives regardless of whether they contributed to
the system. An elderly spouse can draw a benefit half as large as
the working spouse's; if she survives him, she receives the larger
of the two benefits.

   Three-term Gov. Arch Moore met
Morgantown millionaire John Raese in a Republican primary Tuesday,
while seven candidates sought the Democratic nomination.
   Other races included Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd's bid
for a sixth term and a tight battle among five Democrats for two
nominations to the state Supreme Court.
   In the state's presidential primaries, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis was favored to top Jesse Jackson in the race for 24
Democratic delegates, while Vice President George Bush had no
active opposition for 28 Republican delegates.
   Moore, 65, sought the nomination for an unprecedented fourth
four-year term, while Raese, 38, made his second try for political
office; he lost the 1984 U.S. Senate election to Democrat Jay
Rockefeller.
   Among the Democrats, former House of Delegates Speaker Clyde See
_ the 1984 nominee _ and insurance executive Gaston Caperton were
considered the leaders. Also running were Agriculture Commissioner
Gus Douglass, state Sen. Mario Palumbo of Charleston, state Senate
President Dan Tonkovich, former United Mine Workers lawyer Larry
Harless and West Virginia State College art professor Paul Nuchims.
   Byrd, 71, was opposed by Huntington moving company owner Bob
Myers.
   In the GOP Senate primary, state Sen. Jay Wolfe faced Buckhannon
welfare recipient Bernie Lumbert.
   Of the state's four U.S. representatives, all Democrats, only
Nick Joe Rahall of the 4th District was opposed. He faced former
state legislator Ted Stacy and Princeton lawyer William Sanders.
   In the heated race for Supreme Court, Justices Darrell McGraw
and Thomas Miller faced circuit judges Margaret Workman and John
Hey of Kanawha County and Fred Fox of Marion County.
   This was the first election since a grand jury indicted 16 Mingo
County politicians on election law charges as part of a state and
federal investigation into political corruption. Among those facing
charges were several candidates, including Democratic state Sen.
John Pat Fanning.

   The gubernatorial campaign was marked by Moore's refusal to
debate Raese one-on-one. Among Democrats, Tonkovich was accused of
putting his political ambitions above his Senate duties, while
Caperton and See _ the leaders in pre-election polls _ waged an
increasingly bitter war of negative television commercials.
   Moore also was the subject of an NBC report Sunday in which
former Mingo County political boss Johnie Owens said the governor
offered him $12,000 to put him on a 1972 campaign slate. A Moore
spokesman called the report ``a piece of garbage,'' and Raese said
he was ``saddened by the whole event.''
   Moore was elected in 1968 and 1972 and then was barred by state
law from serving a third straight term. After Democrat Jay
Rockefeller served two terms, Moore won re-election in 1984.
   Byrd has said he will give up the majority leader's job to
become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman if he is re-elected
and Democrats retain control of the Senate.
   Reps. Harley Staggers Jr., Alan Mollohan and Bob Wise were
unopposed in the primary, but Rahall was ticketed for trouble when
it was learned he had been arrested in California on a drunken
driving charge. Staggers and Mollohan also have no GOP challengers
in the general election.
   The last governor to lose in a primary was Gov. Edwin W.
Edwards, a Louisiana Democrat, who was beaten in that state's
non-partisan ``open primary'' last October. Edwards finished second
to fellow Democrat Charles E. ``Buddy'' Roemer III, but instead of
forcing a runoff he withdrew from the race.
   In 1986, Gov. William J. Sheffield of Alaska lost the Democratic
primary to Stephen C. Cowper, who won the election in November.

   At West Point, where a campaign is a
military operation rather than a political one, Vice President
George Bush will have to watch what he says.
   Bush, the Republican presidential nomination in his pocket, will
be the main speaker at the U.S. Military Academy's commencement May
25, but he won't be allowed to give his stump speech. Political
campaigning is forbidden on U.S. military installations.
   It may be the first time that a presidential candidate has been
graduation speaker, said West Point spokeswoman Andrea Hamburger.
``We checked with people at our archives and we can't seem to find
any other'' in the academy's 186-year history, she said.
   Bush, who was the incumbent vice president as well as a
vice-presidential candidate at the time, spoke to the 1984
graduating class, promising that the Reagan administration would
``maintain our military strength in order to deter aggression and
protect freedom throughout the world.''

   After he leaves the White House, President
Reagan will be honorary chairman of a conservative issues group,
Citizens for America, that was founded in 1983 to promote his
policies, the group said Tuesday.
   ``The president has agreed to become chairman when he leaves

former director of the Office of Personnel Management.
   Devine said Tuesday that his goals will be to support Reagan's

comprehensive trade legislation that has passed Congress, and back
Contra aid efforts.
   ``My goal is to make CFA the pre-eminent conservative

   ``It looks like a baseball, but it's a globe,'' said Cuomo,
holding the gift presented to him by schoolchildren at North

   ``It's an astrologer's delight. ... It says there's a Democratic

either going to be white or he's going to be black.''
   Cuomo, a Gemini, made his comments before signing a $150 million
bill providing tax exempt state bonds to rebuild and refinance the
60-year-old hospital, one of the nation's largest private,
minority-operated hospitals.

<HEAD>Congressman Urges More Testing, Inspections Of Older Airliners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government should require more extensive
inspections and structural testing of older commercial jetliners to
help deal with the ``black hole of aviation safety,'' Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., said Tuesday.
   ``It is a matter of extreme danger to the flying public and
something that needs to be addressed now,'' said Glickman, a member
and former chairman of the Science, Space and Technology
subcommittee on aviation.
   At a news conference, Glickman said current inspection
requirements by the Federal Aviation Administration were
inadequate. He said he plans to introduce legislation soon to force
the agency to expand its efforts.
   Glickman said his criticisms were prompted by the recent
accident in Hawaii involving an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737, which
lost part of its upper fuselage at 24,000 feet. Federal
investigators have found evidence of cracks caused by metal fatigue
on the remaining fuselage.
   He expressed concern that more accidents could occur with older
planes.
   ``I fear that we're going to see in the next year a whole slew
of these kinds of problems occur,'' said Glickman. ``These can be
prevented but right now barring some form of aggressive FAA role in
older planes I fear some catastrophes occurring in American
aviation.''
   Fred Farrar, an FAA spokesman, took issue with Glickman's
remarks about safety. He also said the agency had started an extra
inspection program for older planes.
   ``We believe that when inspections are done, both the regular
inspections and supplemental inspections, and any necessary
corrections are made, the aircraft are safe,'' said Farrar.
   Underlying Glickman's concern is the question of how long a
jetliner can safely remain in operation. In particular, the
congressman said he was concerned that many older planes were being
used far more intensively than manufacturers originally envisioned,
subjecting them to greater stress from repeated landings, takeoffs
and pressurizations.
   Last week, the Kansas lawmaker sent a letter to FAA
Administrator T. Allan McArtor urging a program of regular
structural inspections for all older jetliners.
   At the news conference, Glickman criticized the FAA for not
conducting more research to determine the structural and
technological lifespans of airliners. He said the government agency
should have a regular program of ``destructive'' testing, in which
it purchases older planes and tears them down to determine the
effects of normal wear and tear.
   Glickman said he would propose legislation to require the FAA
along with NASA to develop state-of-the-art inspection techniques.
Currently, visual and X-ray inspections are used for older planes.
   ``There is an old saying that goes, `What you don't know can't
hurt you.' In the case of old aircraft flying around our skies,
what you don't know can kill you,'' said Glickman.

   President Reagan plans to nominate Philip D.
Winn to be ambassador to Switzerland, succeeding Faith Ryan
Whittlesey, the White House announced Tuesday.
   Since 1987, Winn has served as chairman of the board of the
Philips Development Corp. in Englewood, Colo. He served as chairman
of the board for Philip D. Winn & Associates Inc. from 1976-87.
From 1981-82, he was assistant secretary at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and was at one time the federal
housing commissioner.
   Winn, 63, is a graduate of the University of Michigan and native
of New Britain, Conn.
   Whittlesey is resigning after four years as the ambassador to
Bern.
   The White House also announced Reagan's intention to nominate
Richard Llewellan Williams, a career foreign service officer, to be
ambassador to Mongolia. Diplomatic relations were established at
the ambassadorial level with the Mongolian People's Republic in
January 1987.
   Williams, 58, currently is director of the Office of Chinese and
Mongolian Affairs at the State Department. Previously he served as
deputy counsul general in Hong Kong from 1981-85 and as consul
general in Canton.

<HEAD>Security Forces Told To Shoot Anyone Leaving Golden Temple</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,500 security troops
surrounding the Golden Temple complex were ordered Tuesday to shoot
anyone trying to leave, police said.
   Officers said the order was given after more than 800 people, at
least half of them women and children, were evacuated from the
shrine during a lull in fighting between the troops and armed Sikh
extremists holed up in the complex.
   Members of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force,
carrying automatic rifles and light machine guns, encircled the
400-year-old Golden Temple. Some were posted on rooftops. Others
were concealed behind barricades.
   The two sides resumed intermittent fire for about two hours
after the evacuation. After 1 p.m., no return fire was heard from
the militants. Security forces kept up occasional fire until
sundown, usually whenever a Sikh appeared briefly over the walls of
the sprawling compound.
   Seven Indian reporters and photographers, who spent most of
Monday trapped inside the complex, emerged late Monday night and
said at least 100 militants with automatic rifles were inside.
   One casualty was reported Tuesday. Dilbagh Singh, a 31-year-old
Sikh who was among the evacuees, was shot in the leg. He told a
reporter he was wounded while walking toward the temple's inner
sanctum with two Sikh militants.
   The entire city of Amritsar, with a population of about 800,000,
was under curfew Monday and Tuesday. Residents were told to stay
indoors.
   There was no word whether police planned to storm the temple.
   The siege began Monday after an exchange of fire between Sikhs
inside the temple and security troops killed at least five people
and wounded 10. The Golden Temple is the main stronghold of Sikhs
demanding an independent homeland or greater autonomy for Punjab
state, which includes Amritsar.
   Although a majority in Punjab, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of
India's total population of 800 million. The Sikhs claim they are
discriminated against by Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the
nationwide population.
   Most of the evacuees were pilgrims who had gone to the temple
Monday to celebrate the anniversary of the day in the 17th century
when Hargobind Singh was installed as the sixth guru of the Sikh
faith.
   Much of the security troops' fire Tuesday afternoon was directed
at a watch tower overlooking the main temple entrance. Shots rang
out whenever men appeared in the tower in their highly visible,
saffron-colored turbans, the headgear of Sikh men. No Sikhs were
seen returning fire and reporters could not tell if any of them
were hit.
   An officer at a machine gun post outside the Golden Temple said
he had orders to fire at anyone seen atop the tower or trying to
escape.
   ``We have them under control for now, but they also have their
weapons trained on us,'' said the officer, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Punjab state Police Chief K.P.S. Gill said it was impossible for
any militant to escape the cordon. ``We have drawn up a very tight
ring,'' he said.
   The temple complex has at least 17 exits. In a half-dozen places
the boundary wall is low enough to jump over.
   ``The decision (whether to storm the temple) has to come from
the top, but we are ready,'' said A.A. Siddiqui, deputy inspector
of police.
   Most Sikhs would view any such action as a desecration. Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi's decision to storm the temple in June 1984
to oust militants led to her assassination by Sikh bodyguards that
same year.
   The militants' violent campaign for an independent homeland
began in 1982 and has claimed at least 940 lives in Punjab so far
this year.

<HEAD>Envoy Says Some US Consulates To Be Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian President Manuel Solis Palma has
ordered the closing of a number of Panamanian consulates in the
United States, an opposition leader said Tuesday.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has remained loyal to ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle, said most of the consulates
informed of the move were staffed by personnel who also are
Delvalle supporters.
   He said money that the pro-Delvalle consulates had been
receiving from official services had been placed in escrow accounts
rather than being sent to Panama.
   The Reagan administration, like Sosa, does not recognize the
legitimacy of the Solis Palma government and had no comment on the
reported action.
   Sosa said the offices received word they were being shut down on
Monday. They include offices in Washington, New York, Seattle, San
Diego, Atlanta and Los Angeles, he said.
   It was unclear whether pro-Delvalle diplomats would attempt to
keep the consulates operating despite the shutdown order.
   Panamanian sources told The Washington Times that the Panamanian
government stopped short of ordering home the diplomats affected by
the shutdowns.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Plan That Might Lead to Some Military Base
Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, trying to decide what to do with
one of its most sacred cows, voted approval of a plan Tuesday that
eventually could mean some of the nation's 3,600 military
installations may be shut down.
   ``This is the stickiest wicket in this bill,'' said Sen. Alan
Dixon, D-Ill., as he acknowledged the political sensitivity of the
base-closing provision, which is part of the Pentagon budget bill
now on the Senate floor.
   The plan, approved on an 83-13 vote, provides for the creation
of a 15-member commission that will review the nation's 3,600
military facilities to determine which of them can be closed.
   The panel's report will be sent to Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci by next Dec. 31, and he will then have 15 days to either
accept or reject all the commission recommendations. That means
Carlucci, who supports the base-closing plan, might order closures
only five days before the Reagan administration leaves office.
   Military bases mean jobs, and for more than a decade, Congress
has effectively blocked the closure of any bases by requiring
lengthy, detailed environmental studies about proposed base
closings.
   Pentagon officials have estimated that closing unneeded military
bases could save between $2 billion and $5 billion a year.
   ``There is a perception in the country, and I think it's
accurate, that Congress cannot act to close a single base because
of the political ramifications,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
``It's time some bases went, no matter whose state they are in.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-N.C., agreed. He noted that ``the real
issue is one that concerns each of us _ and that is the potential
loss of jobs in our states and resulting economic dislocations. ...
These are very real concerns.''
   The commission plan was first proposed as a way to take Congress
off the hook for recommending which bases should be closed. But the
original plan was to create a nine-member commission, which was
tentatively announced last week by Carlucci.
   That ran into opposition in the Senate, where some legislators
said a congressional voice was needed for such a panel.
   Dixon originally proposed adding six House and Senate members to
the commission, but that idea was dropped during a long day of
backstage negotiations.
   Finally, Dixon approved a compromise plan that would have
Carlucci appoint six more members, for a total of 13. The final six
would be named after Carlucci consults with key legislators.
   The plan also includes a provision that any action by Carlucci
could only be blocked if both the House and Senate vote to do so.
   ``Our communities rely on these bases,'' said Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich. ``When these bases are closed, it better not look
political.''
   Levin supported the congressionally approved members as a way to
add credibility to a Pentagon panel which legislators fear will
base its findings on previous Defense Department studies of which
bases should be closed.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas agreed that closing
installations is sensitive, but added, ``I hope we can close
some.... I know there are some that are unneeded.''
   The commission plan is not part of the House version of its
defense bill, which that chamber is scheduled to finally approve on
Wednesday. House leaders say it will be considered soon in separate
legislation.
   The Pentagon budget bills which will be approved separately in
each chamber eventually will go to a conference committee to
reconcile differences, including the base-closing plan.
   Both bills authorize $299.5 billion in defense spending for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.

   American union officials Tuesday displayed a
red and white banner reading ``Break Chains on Solidarnosc,
Poland's Free Union'' on the building across the street from the
Soviet Embassy.
   ``We are here, this sign is here, to support the Polish workers
in their fight to have free trade unions,'' said William H.
Bywater, president of the 200,000-member International Union of
Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers
(IUE).
   ``At the same time we are sending a message to the Soviet Union
about their client state _ and they talk about changes, more
democracy. If they are the worker state they are not treating the
workers very well,'' he said. The IUE building has constantly
displayed a banner, a ``Solidarnosc'' (Solidarity) flag or both
since 1983.
   Bywater told reporters Tuesday that the union's support of the
workers in Poland was shared throughout the U.S. labor movement. He
said he will ask IUE members to send financial support to the
Solidarity Endowment, a non-profit group developed to aid the
outlawed Solidarity labor movement in Poland.
   Peter Mroczyk, president of the endowment, said the group hoped
to raise $1 million in the next year to aid the families of jailed
Polish workers, send machinery, clothes, supplies and to support
publications.
   ``We want to send a very strong signal to Solidarity and to the
people of Poland, that they are not alone. They have not been
forgotten,'' Mroczyk said.
   The IUE action coincided with the current wave of strikes in
Poland that began April 25. It has been Poland's worst period of
labor unrest since martial law was declared and Solidarity outlawed
in 1981.
   IUE Local 201 board member Krzysztof ``Kris'' Czarnecki of Lynn,
Mass., left Poland as a child in 1965. He said his uncles had to
return this week because the Polish government would not let their
families leave.
   ``This morning they said they were going to give (the workers) a
raise. But you can't buy anything with it, there's no food there to
buy,'' he said.
   ``My uncle Joseph was part of the Solidarity in Gdansk but on a
very limited level. Everybody's afraid. The government is after
them on every corner. If they are not after the people themselves
they are their wives or whatever. They live in constant fear,''
Czarnecki said in an interview.
   ``Before he left, my uncle said to me, `You can chain us, but
you can't chain our hearts,''' he said.
   Shipyard workers in Gdansk ended their strike without settlement
on Tuesday, but a sixth strike was expected to begin Monday at a
tractor factory on the outskirts of Warsaw.

<TEXT>
   Ciaran Bourke, a founding member of the
Dubliners folk music group, died Tuesday after suffering a brain
hemorrhage. He was 48.
   Bourke, who sang ballads and played the guitar and tin whistle
in the Dubliners' raucous style, had left the group in 1974 when he
had a brain hemorrhage that left him partially paralyzed. He became
an antique dealer.
   He suffered a second hemorrhage Sunday and died at St. Vincent's
Hospital in Dublin.
   Bourke and four fellow Irishmen formed the Dubliners in 1962 and
the group toured Britain, the United States, Australia, New Zealand
and their homeland.
   The Dubliners cut short a British concert tour to visit Bourke
in the hospital.
   ``It is just like we lost a brother,'' said Ronnie Drew, the
group's lead singer. ``Ciaran meant so much to us all.''
   Bourke had performed with the group in an anniversary
celebration broadcast on Irish television in 1986.
   The other founders of the Dubliners were Drew, John Sheehan,
Barney McKenna and Luke Kelly, who died of cancer in 1984.
   Bourke translated many of the group's ballads from the original
Gaelic into English.
   Their songs include ``The Town I Love So Well,'' ``The Molly
Maguires,'' ``Dirty Old Town'' and ``Seven Drunken Nights.''
   Bourke is survived by his wife, Jeannie, six daughters, two
brothers, two sisters and his father.

   Reputed mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky''
Scarfo grinned and raised his hand in a victory salute Tuesday
after a jury acquitted him and eight associates of the slaying of
rival Salvatore Testa.
   ``Not guilty,'' forewoman Ollie Minze intoned 27 times to the
charges of murder, conspiracy and possession of an instrument of
crime, three counts for each defendant.
   Friends and relatives in the crowded City Hall courtroom
cheered, wept and applauded.
   ``I love the American judicial system,'' Scarfo's son, Nicodemo
Jr., said afterwards.
   He had been in court every day, with other relatives, supporting
his jailed father, an Atlantic City, N.J., cement contractor said
by authorities to head the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey mob.
   The regional crime family has been decimated in the past decade
by bloody internal warfare, arrests and convictions.
   Testa's body was found Sept. 14, 1984, in a wooded area near a
highway in southern New Jersey.
   The 59-year-old Scarfo, nattily attired in a navy gabardine
suit, has been in prison since his arrest in January 1987 for
conspiring to extort $1 million from a Philadelphia developer. He
is serving a 15-year sentence for that crime.
   The acquittal was the second court victory in six months for
Scarfo, who was cleared in December on drug charges.
   Stunned by the verdict, Assistant District Attorney Barbara
Christie asked that the jury be polled. Ms. Christie had described
Scarfo as ``an organized-crime executioner'' who marked mob members
for immediate death when they questioned his authority.
   Scarfo's attorney, Robert Simone, was elated with the verdict _
the second case in a row that he had won acquittal for his client
and other mob members.
   The defendants had been accused of criminal activities by two
ex-gangsters who turned government informants because, they said,
Scarfo had ordered them killed.
   In December, Scarfo was found innocent of federal drug
racketeering charges, and the chief evidence against him and six
associates came from Nicholas ``Nicky Crow'' Caramandi and Thomas
``Tommy Del'' DelGiorno, who had successfully testified against him
in an extortion case.
   Simone branded the two former mobsters as liars and admitted
murderers who could not be believed.
   Simone said the latest acquittals were ``a signal to the whole
country that you just don't persecute people because of their
alleged associations and activities.
   The office of District Attorney Ronald Castille said, in a brief
statement, ``We really don't have any comment beyond the fact that
we are obviously disappointed.''

   An engineer killed in a commuter train crash
last month had traces of marijuana in his system, and a
dispatcher's urine showed traces of morphine and codeine, the
Federal Railroad Administration said Tuesday.
   Tests showed that three other Metro-North Commuter Railroad
employees connected to the collision also had drugs in their
systems, the agency said.
   In Washington, agency chief John Riley called for mandatory
random drug testing of railroad employees. He said that in the past
16 months, rail accidents in which at least one employee tested
positive for drugs have occurred at a rate of one every 10 days.
   ``This insanity has got to stop,'' he said.
   The morphine traces found in dispatcher Thomas Furlong's urine
``are comparable to those which could be expected following heroin
use,'' said Lou Brott, an agency spokesman.
   The engineer, Raymond Hunter, was killed when his train slammed
into the rear of another empty commuter train April 6 in Mount
Vernon. The Stamford, Conn., resident tested positive for marijuana
in his urine and his blood, the agency said.
   Metro-North officials have blamed Hunter, 42, for failing to
activate an automatic safety system that could have prevented the
collision. They also have said the train appeared to be traveling
well over the 15 mph speed limit when the accident occurred.
   The other employees who tested positive for narcotics _ block
operators Peter Faber, 36, of Mount Vernon, and George Torres, 35,
of New York City and leverman William Jones, 37, of Mount Vernon _
have been absolved of responsibility for the crash, said Susan
Gilbert, a Metro-North spokeswoman.
   Edward Yule, president of the United Transportation Union, which
represents the men, was out of his office Tuesday and could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   Faber and Torres showed traces of butalbital, a barbiturate, in
their urine and blood, and Jones had traces marijuana in his,
according to the FRA.
   Like dispatcher Furlong, they were suspended after the accident
and now face a disciplinary hearing on charges based on the drug
test results.
   Riley declined to say if the tests indicated whether drugs might
have affected the men's performances. He said a final report on the
accident, to be released in about two months, ``will determine the
role drug use played in the incident.''
   Nicholas Lappas, a professor in George Washington University's
department of forensic sciences, said it was difficult to
determine, based on the amounts of drugs found in the men's
systems, whether any of them was under the influence of drugs at
the time of the accident.
   Metro-North employees found to have used drugs on the job must
enter a substance abuse program or face dismissal. They also are
subject to spot drug testing while in the program.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill for U.S. To Join International Copyright Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill authorizing the United States to join
76 other countries as a signatory to a 102-year-old treaty on
copyright protection of literary and artistic works was approved
unanimously Tuesday by the House.
   The vote on the so-called Berne Convention was 420-0. Separate
legislation ratifying the treaty is awaiting action by the Senate,
which is expected to vote within the next few months.
   Supporters of U.S. adherence to the treaty say it will provide
improved copyright protection for American creative works,
including computer technology and musical records and tapes,
against foreign piracy and counterfeiting.
   The bill lacks a ``moral rights'' provision sought primarily by
movie directors and screenwriters to prevent colorizing and other
alterations in films sold to television broadcasters.
   To conform with the treaty, the bill changes U.S. copyright law
to eliminate a requirement that to have copyright protection, a
published work must indicate that it is copyrighted. Such a
designation henceforth would be voluntary.
   The bill clarifies that ``pictorial, graphic and sculptural
works'' receiving copyright protection include architectural plans.
   The measure also would replace compulsory jukebox licenses with
voluntary negotiations between jukebox operators and composers of
copyrighted music for payment of royalties and fees, with a
provision for compulsory licenses if negotiations fail.

<HEAD>Areas in Four States Singled Out For Further Study of
Contamination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department said Tuesay it had
singled out areas in California, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming for
further study of contamination caused by irrigation drainage water.
   The four areas are the Salton Sea in California, the Stillwater
Wildlife Management Area in Nevada, the Middle Green River Basin in
Utah and the Kendrick irrigation project in Wyoming.
   The department's announcement gave few specifics on its
researchers' findings of contaminants in water, sediment and
wildlife tissue. The information compiled during two years of
research is available in larger reports, which were not distributed
with the announcement.
   In a statement, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel said, ``Some
localized problems related to irrigation drainage water do exist.''
Hodel also said, ``The more detailed work we will undertake will
provide the scientific understanding necessary to mitigate or
resolve the problems we have found.''
   Researchers were looking for trace elements, notably selenium
easily liberated from many Western soils; radioactivity; pesticide
residues and other chemicals.
   Selenium is a trace element necessary for nutrition in minute
amounts but toxic in larger doses. Extraordinarily high
concentrations were put in the Kesterson Wildlife Refuge in
California by drain water from the Westlands Water District,
forcing the closing of the drain after large-scale deaths of
waterfowl.
   The one-page summaries released Tuesday provided some data only
for the Green River area, and the significance of those findings
was not explained.
   Summaries also were released for the Laguna Atascosa National
Wildlife Refuge in Texas; the Milk and Sun river irrigation
projects in Montana; Tulare Lake in California and the Lower
Colorado River bordering Nevada, California and Arizona. At these
areas, more sampling will be done but ``not on as intensive a
basis,'' said department spokesman Mitch Snow.
   Groundwater drains at Stewart Lake in the Middle Green River
Basin contained selenium in concentrations of 14 to 140 parts per
billion; carp taken from the lake contained 31 parts per million;
the livers of coots taken from the lake showed selenium of 4.9 to
26 ppm and averaged 32 ppm from coots at North Roadside Pond; water
in the pond contained as much as 93 ppm selenium.
   California authorities warn that selenium concentrations above 2
ppm or 2,000 ppb in food can be dangerous to pregnant women and
children under 15. The Environmental Protection Agency limits
drinking water concentrations to 0.01 ppm or 10 ppb.
   The summary for Kendrick said selenium concentrations were
``elevated at several locations.'' Snow said the larger report
showed the median concentration of 24 ground and surface water
samples was 7.5 ppb.
   Detailed reports of the Salton Sea and Stillwater areas will not
be avilable until later this year because additional sampling was
undertaken there, the department said. No summaries for those areas
were released.
   The Lower Colorado River summary said ``average selenium
concentrations in fish approach, and in some instances exceed,
concentrations that could result in reproductive impairment in
certain fish'' but ``agricultural practicies in the Lower Colorado
River Valley do not at this time appear to increase selenium
concentrations.''
   DDE, a breakdown product of DDT, the pesticide banned 16 years
ago, also was found.
   Researchers in the Tulare Lake area found high concentrations of
unspecified trace elements at the Westfarmers Ponds, according to
the summary, and ``preliminary evidence of adverse biological
effects on shorebirds at the Westfarmers ponds was obtained.''
   In Montana, the Freezout Lake Game Management Area and the
Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge had some sites where
concentrations of unspecified ``toxic elements in water, bottom
sediment and biota were moderately to extremely high.''
   At the Dry Lake unit of the Milk river irrigation project,
concentrations of chromium, nickel, vanadium and zinc were double
average background levels. Boron was found in coot livers at levels
that could impair reproduction.
   At Sun River, nitrates above state standards were found in
groundwater wells.
   At Laguna Atascosa and in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, DDT and
other pesticide residues in fish were lower than they had been in
the 1970s but still ``higher than the national baseline'' and ``of
concern.''

   The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked the
Wednesday execution of convicted Texas killer James Edward Smith,
whose mother says he is mentally incompetent.
   The justices, without a recorded dissenting vote, granted an
emergency request filed on behalf of Smith's mother, Alexine
Hamilton of Indianapolis.
   Smith, 37, was convicted of the 1983 robbery-slaying in Houston
of Larry Rohus, an insurance office manager. He chose not to
appeal, saying he prefers death over prolonging his life on death
row.
   The stay of execution is granted pending Supreme Court action on
a likely formal appeal on behalf of Smith.
   There have been 98 executions nationwide since the Supreme Court
in 1976 allowed capital punishment to resume.

<TEXT>
   Voters delivered a split decision in
parliamentary elections Tuesday, leaving unresolved the dispute
over Denmark's ban on nuclear weapons and its allegiance to NATO.
   Complete results showed a small setback for the socialist
opposition but no gain for Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's
center-right minority coalition in the 179-member Folketing, or
Parliament.
   Schlueter had called the early election hoping to win a clear
endorsement of Denmark's ``full membership'' in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   The Social Democrats, Denmark's largest party, pushed through a
resolution in Parliament last month designed to reinforce a 1957
peacetime ban on nuclear weapons on Danish territory. Both the
United States and Britain had expressed opposition to the measure.
   Only the far-right Progress Party, campaigning for lower taxes
and less immigration, improved its standing. It won 16 seats, seven
more than it had held before.
   Schlueter's Conservative party dropped three seats, holding 35,
but they were picked up by other parties in the four-party
coalition and the alliance held on to its 70-seat total.
   The two-party socialist partnership lost two seats to command
79. The Social Democrats will hold 55 seats and the Socialist
People's Party 24.
   The swing party Social-Liberals held 10, a loss of one.
   Two semi-independent territories, the Faeroe Islands and
Greenland, each elect two representativs.
   Final results showed 3,913,318 ballts were cast for a turnout of
85.8 percent.
   Schlueter claimed the results would ease Denmark's crisis with
NATO.
   But Social Democratic leader Svend Auken said the election
showed most voters backed the anti-nuclear measure that requires
the government to notify visiting warships of Denmark's 1957 ban
against nuclear weapons during peacetime.
   Auken said he would continue the battle in the legislature to
implement the resolution. The precise wording of the letter to be
sent to ship captains remains to be drafted.
   Schlueter, in a television appearance, called on Auken to
quietly negotiate ``a sensible solution'' to the issue that
prompted the early election only eight months after the previous
balloting.
   Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the coalition's
Liberal Party, said he believed Schlueter's government could
continue.
   ``There is still a non-socialist majority,'' he told a
television interviewer. The other coalition members are the Center
Democratic and Christian People's parties.
   Twelve parties contested the election, but only nine won seats.
   Clearly elated, Progress Party leader Morgans Glistrup said his
victory ``was good for the country.''
   However, the party was not expected to be a factor in coalition
bargaining since it is shunned by mainstream politicians.
   Every Danish government since 1973 has lacked a majority in
Parliament, and Danish politics usually are managed through
backstage bargaining.
   Before the Social Democrat resolution passed last month, Denmark
took the position that its NATO allies abided by the rules
established in 1957.
   The United States and Britain said the measure threatened the
solidarity of the Western military alliance and was against their
own policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear
arms.
   Britain said the Danish action jeopardized its plans to send
troops in times of crisis to reinforce Denmark, which controls the
narrow access to the Baltic Sea.
   Unless the resolution is overturned by the new Parliament, the
government will have to carry it out, after the wording has been
determined.
   Schlueter has indicated he would follow the Norwegian model.
Norway, also a NATO country with a peacetime nuclear ban, reminds
allies that their ships are expected to abide by Norwegian law but
does not explicitly mention nuclear weapons.
   The election came the day before Secretary of State George
Shultz was to meet Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in
Geneva to prepare for a Moscow summit in two weeks.
   The nuclear issue ``couldn't come at a worse time,'' said a
diplomat from a NATO country, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A perception that Denmark is wavering in its support of the
Western alliance could strenghthen the Soviets' hand.
   During the campaign, most coalition parties focused on the NATO
issue.
   However, the opposition stressed economic concerns, on which it
made some gains in the September election.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Acknowledges Confusion About His Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev says there is ``confusion in
the minds of many people,'' about his reforms but even those who
yield to fear may not really oppose social change.
   The Soviet leader told editors and Communist Party ideologists
that conservatism is the biggest threat to ``perestroika,'' or
rebuilding society, and doubters have questioned whether the nation
is turning away from communism. The speech was delivered Saturday
but not reported until late Tuesday.
   He did not make clear whether misunderstandings about his plans
for a more democratic society and stronger economy reached into the
13-man party Politburo over which he presides.
   Party ideologist Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2 man in the
Kremlin, is said to favor a more cautious approach to confronting
economic and social problems than Gorbachev, but the extent of
their differences is not clear.
   Gorbachev told his audience: ``Some people have indeed lost
their bearings amid all these processes under way.
   ``Some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked, and
the panic _ and this is very serious _ has taken the form of
asking: `Isn't perestroika coming to mean the wrecking and
rejection of the values of socialism, isn't it giving rise to alien
phenomena, isn't it destabilizing society?'''
   The 57-year-old leader added, however, that not everyone who
fears his reforms or has resisted them should be labeled ``an
opponent of perestroika.''
   ``We found veritable confusion in the minds of many people _
workers, intellectuals and administrators alike,'' he said. ``And
let us be blunt, not only on the ground level, but also on the
top.''
   Some sources have said Ligachev challenged Gorbachev's policies
two months ago in supporting publication of a letter from a
Leningrad teacher who said perestroika was destroying the nation
built by Josef Stalin.
   A denunciation of the letter in the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda was viewed by some as a warning to Ligachev and
conservatives that perestroika was above criticism.
   Gorbachev said many people who were taught inefficient working
habits simply do not know how to do their jobs any other way.
   ``It is shown that perestroika pinches someone and they start
resisting, hampering the process of renewal of society,'' he said.
But he appeared to forgive those tendencies when he added:
   ``We are all products of our time. We have conceived perestroika
and we also manifest many of the things that inhibit it.''
   He said the Politburo decided he personally should explain the
reforms and the challenge they represent before the Communist Party
conference that begins June 28. The 5,000 delegates will redefine
the party's tasks and are expected to replace conservatives with
more active supporters of perestroika.
   ``It is necessary to rid socialism of everything
pseudosocialist, distorted and deformed in the period of the
personality cult,'' Gorbachev said in a reference to Stalin, who
ruled for 29 years until his death in 1953.
   The next few years will be difficult, he said, but he claimed
progress in improving health care, education and agriculture. ``The
three years since the April 1985 Central Committee plenum have
borne out that we have made the right choice,'' he declared,
referring to the party meeting at which he unveiled his plans.
   He concluded by urging the delegates to the June conference to
``give our perestroika a new, second wind.''

<HEAD>Reports Torture and Violence Widespread in South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Commission of Jurists on Tuesday
accused South African security forces of widespread use of torture
and violence and said it was part of the government's repressive
strategy.
   A 160-page report said children are among the victims.
   It said there is evidence that ``an undemocratic government has
extended the executive power of the state so as to undermine the
rule of law and destroy basic human rights.''
   The 1982 Internal Security Act adopted by South Africa's
white-minority government creates a series of criminal offenses of
a political character ``in extremely wide and often vague terms,''
according to the report.
   It said the security act, along with one-sided procedural rules,
provides the state ``with the means of securing the conviction of
virtually any political opponent.''
   ``We have found that the government has allowed intimidation of
suspects and accused persons, and interference with legal processes
by the security forces ... to take place on a large scale and in a
variety of ways.''
   The report was written by four West European legal experts sent
to South Africa last year by the commission.
   They said, ``We stress particularly the widespread use of
torture and violence, even against children, which is habitually
denied by the government and thus goes unpunished, though plainly
illegal even under South African law.''
   Major abuses by the security forces also include the ``use of
excessive force (including many killings) in crowd control
operations,'' the encouragement of vigilante forces and arrests and
intimidation of lawyers representing opponents of the government,
the report said.
   It added that recent economic and moral pressure has ``forced a
degree of relaxation in the formal structure of apartheid but the
will of the ruling minority to retain popwer seems undiminished.''
   South Africa is faced with a dilemma, the authors said. ``A
repressive strategy ... has become increasingly necessary to
contain the huge disenfranchised majority, yet the acknowledgment
of such a strategy cannot be easily reconciled with South Africa's
pretensions to legitimacy within the Western liberal tradition.''
   The report was compiled by Briton Geoffrey Bindman; Jean-Marie
Crettaz of Switzerland; Henry Downing of Ireland, and West German
Guenter Witzsch.
   They said they were able to travel freely in South Africa but
many who agreed to be interviewed ``clearly did so at some personal
risk.'' Contacts were maintained so that the report covered
developments through February 1988, they said.
   The International Commission of Jurists is a Geneva-based
non-governmental organization and its members include up to 40
jurists from non-communist countries in various parts of the world.
   By South African law and custom, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Severe thunderstorms and hail raked parts of Alabama Tuesday as
storms developed from the Appalachians to western New York.
   Large hail and strong winds damaged a barn and chicken houses at
a farm in Wayne County, Miss., northeast of Hattiesburg.
   Hail the size of quarters and half-dollars dented cars and
cracked windshields near Montgomery, Ala. Hail also accompanied
thunderstorms along the Carolinas coast and in West Virginia in the
southern Appalachians.
   Severe thunderstorm watches were in effect Tuesday evening for
parts of central and southern Alabama, southwest Georgia and the
Florida panhandle, and along the Gulf Coast to Louisiana. A watch
also was in effect for south-central and southeast Virginia and
much of the Carolinas.
   Thunderstorms also developed Tuesday afternoon over much of New
York and Pennsylvania. Pea-sized hail occurred at the Rochester,
N.Y., airport, and winds gusted to 44 mph at Pittsburgh.
   Rain occurred in parts of east-central New York and New England.
   Widely scattered showers fell in central Iowa and scattered
showers and thunderstorms extended from western South Dakota across
southeast Wyoming to central Colorado.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included a half inch or more at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, S.C.;
Atlanta; Casper, Wyo.; and Columbus, Ga.
   El Paso, Texas., had a record low of 42 degrees Tuesday morning.
The old record for the date was 43 degrees in 1896.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44 degrees at Brunswick
Naval Air Station, Maine, to 100 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The morning low was 16 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from central Florida across southeast Georgia to the
Carolinas coast, showers from the middle Atlantic Coast across
eastern Pennsylvania and eastern New York to New England, mostly
along the coast, and scattered showers in Wisconsin and eastern
Minnesota.
   High temperatures were expected to reach in the 70s or 80s
across most of the nation, except for 50s and 60s from northern
Minnesota across the Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio Valley
to the northern Atlantic Coast states, 90s in central and southwest
Texas and 90s to near 105 degrees in the Southwest's deserts.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd appealed
to the Kremlin on Tuesday to help end the dispute over on-site
inspection that is blocking Senate action on the medium-range
missile treaty.
   ``The Soviets hold the key,'' Byrd told the Senate.
   But Byrd said that although Senate action on the pact has been
temporarily ``put on the back burner,'' he could call it up for
debate Friday if negotiations in Geneva between Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
resolve the issue.
   Byrd said he would need an iron-clad commitment from the Soviets
in writing.
   President Reagan had urged the Senate to ratify the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty before his Moscow summit
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev begins May 29. However,
White House officials acquiesced Monday in the bipartisan decision
by Senate leaders to delay debate on the treaty due to the
outstanding disputes.
   The chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee said, meanwhile, that the treaty cannot be ratified if
the Soviets continue to balk on on-site verification procedures.
   Chairman David Boren, D-Okla. and Vice Chairman William Cohen,
D-Maine, commented after delivering a report to Senate leaders
apparently resolving an unrelated dispute over the inclusion in the
treaty of such futuristic weapons as those employing laser rays or
particle beam generators.
   The treaty is silent on such weapons although administration
negotiators contended futuristic weapons were included under the
pact's ban on any medium-range weapon, no matter what it uses to
destroy or damage a target.
   ``While there are many problems associated with monitoring
futuristic weapons, ... the committee believes that on balance U.S.
interests in monitoring the treaty are better served by banning
missiles using current or future weapons technologies to damage or
destroy a target than by excluding them from the scope of the
treaty,'' the panel's letter said.
   Otherwise, the committee contended, U.S. intelligence would be
hard pressed to tell the difference between unbanned futuristic
weapons and those armed with nuclear or conventional warheads which
were banned.
   Cohen said the remaining roadblock remains the ``untenable''
position he said the Soviets have taken on on-site inspection.
   ``There has to be an absolute meeting of the minds on that
before I can agree to support the treaty, Cohen said.
   He added that unless the Soviets back down and resolve the
dispute, ``the treaty cannot be ratified.''
   Boren added: ``It's just a matter of whether the Soviets have
the political will to say they are willing to live up to the
commitments on on-site inspection.
   ``If they don't have that will, then there is a very serious
problem for the treaty,'' he said. ``Some vague, cosmetic language
coming back from Geneva just won't do the trick.''
   Earlier, some Democratic senators reportedly protested delay on
the treaty _ which requires the elimination of all ground-launched
missiles with a range of 315 to 3,125 miles _ expressing concern
that Reagan and Gorbachev would be unable to make further arms
control progress at their Moscow summit if the accord is not
ratified by then.
   But Byrd declared: ``The Senate would certainly look foolish to
go into debate with these matters that need fixing hanging out
there.''
   ``I can't go ahead with it if there are multitudinous or even
one gap through which the Soviets can cheat,'' said Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Speaking to reporters, he said, ``It could be resolved in a
matter of hours, in a matter of days, or it might never be
resolved.''
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., told the Senate: ``We are asking the
Soviets to put up or shut up on on-site inspection.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said on-site inspection represents the chief value of
the treaty to the arms control process, because it can lead the way
to effective verification of a far more sweeping agreement to
reduce long-range nuclear weapons by as much as 50 percent.
   The issue will be discussed when Shultz confers with
Shevardnadze at Geneva on Wednesday and Thursday. Nunn said it is
important that it be satisfactorily resolved at that time.
   Byrd agreed, saying, ``The Soviets can resolve this fast. The
thing that can expedite this is for the administration and the
Soviets to sit down and close these loopholes.''
   ``We don't want to give the Soviets loopholes to cheat,'' he
said. ``This obviously needs fixing and the time to fix it is
before the Senate takes up the treaty.''
   Nunn told the Senate: ``We will learn whether we indeed have a
breakthrough in on-site inspection. If on-site inspection fails we
will have a catastrophe.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration backs the delay in the Senate debate.
   ``We feel this is a prudent and reasonable course of action,''
he said. ``There is unanimity between the administration and the
bipartisan Senate leadership that these problems should be
satisfactorily and promptly resolved prior to ratification.''
   Assistant Senate Republican Leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming and
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., emerging from a morning meeting with
President Reagan, said they were confident that the problems can be
surmounted.
   ``I think that they will do their usual good job of splicing
things back together again,'' Simpson said, referring to the
Shultz-Shevardnadze meeting.

   The number of confirmed cases of Legionnaires'
disease in the outbreak at the headquarters of the British
Broadcasting Corp. rose to 24 Tuesday, with seven victims seriously
ill, public health officials said.
   They reported there are 45 other suspected cases.
   The Westminster borough officials said new cases could develop
over the next few days, but the risk of infection has been
eliminated by the disinfection of air conditioning systems at the
BBC headquarters where the outbreak began in mid-April.
   Symptoms similar to pneumonia are produced by the disease, which
can be caused by bacteria from water-cooled air conditioning units.
   The disease is named after an outbreak at the American Legion
convention in Philadelphia in 1976. Doctors say it is fatal in
about 15 percent of cases.

<HEAD>Bahamian Government Claims It Fights Drugs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lehder Trial Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bahamian government took out a
full-page advertisement Tuesday in U.S. and Caribbean newspapers in
an attempt at ``setting the record straight'' about new allegations
of corruption and lack of anti-drug efforts.
   The Bahamas decided to buy the ads as part of its response to
charges of Bahamian drug corruption raised in various quarters,
including the federal trial of Colombia's reputed drug kingpin,
Carlos Lehder Rivas, government spokesman Bill Kalis said.
   The ad in The New York Times, Washington Post, Miami Herald and
other newspapers was addressed to ``the people of the United States
of America'' and signed by Bahamian Attorney General Paul L.
Adderly.
   It says the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has devoted much of its
limited resources to fighting drugs and needs more U.S. aid.
   Specifically, the ad cites the need for ``more air search radar
installations, more joint bases strategically located with
helicopter strike force teams, more air reconnaissance patrols,
more sea patrols and intensified joint undercover and conspiracy
investigations.''
   It says the archipelago of 700 islands and keys and 250,000
people spends 13 percent of its national budget on law enforcement,
mostly fighting drugs produced in South America and bound for users
in the United States.
   Published reports have said grand juries in Tampa and Miami are
investigating Prime Minister Sir Lynden O. Pindling. And reports in
Congress have raised doubts about Bahamian drug-fighting efforts.
   ``He started thinking about this during these latest allegations
at the Lehder trial,'' Kalis said.
   ``As you know, the position was not to respond while the
testimony was being heard. Now that the testimony is over, the
prime minister wanted to take an opportunity to make the Bahamian
position better known.''
   During Lehder's trial in Jacksonville, U.S. Attorney Robert
Merkle had produced testimony that Pindling was receiving drug
payoffs of up to $5 million. Lehder allegedly used Norman's Cay in
the Bahamas as a key transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for
Florida and Georgia.
   Adderly's advertisement Tuesday called attention to a 1984 Royal
Commission of Inquiry report in the Bahamas that criticized lack of
cooperation by U.S. authorities during its probe into official drug
corruption. That commission found evidence of drug corruption in
some levels of the Bahamian government and law enforcement, but did
not tie Pindling to drug payoffs.
   Last week, Pindling issued a statement to the news media and at
a rally flatly denying taking drug payoffs.
   Pindling said he was not surprised by the allegations at
Lehder's trial but would be surprised if any of the grand juries
reportedly investigating his affairs indicted him.
   Pindling was re-elected last year after criticizing the
corruption allegations, which first surfaced in a 1983 report. He
has been in power since breaking the hold of the white-minority
government in 1967.

<HEAD>Government Signs Peace Pact with Sinhalese Exremists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has signed a peace
agreement with a Sinhalese extremist group accused of killing at
least 260 people during the past nine months, President Junius R.
Jayewardene said Tuesday.
   ``We have signed an agreement with the People's Liberation Front
with a hope to end bloodshed, to bring back peace in Sri Lanka,''
Jayewardene said. He spoke during an award ceremony at a police
target-shooting contest in Colombo.
   National Security Minister Lalith Athulathmudali told a news
conference the accord calls for members of the front to lay down
their arms by May 29 and cease all attacks immediately.
   Jayewardene said that as part of the agreement he has lifted a
five-year-old ban on political activities by the front and 20
affiliated student organizations and trade unions.
   He said he would soon release all front members who have been
detained, except for those charged with murder or attempted murder.
A front representative said 4,000 front members are imprisoned.
   The People's Liberation Front has said it was defending the
interests of the island nation's Sinhalese majority against demands
of the Tamil minority.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form 18 percent of the island's
population of 16 million. They claim the Buddhist Sinhalese
discriminate against them.
   Tamil militants have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy
or an independent homeland in predominantly Tamil northern and
eastern Sri Lanka.
   The People's Liberation Front opposes an agreement signed in
July by Sri Lank and India to end the separatist campaign by Tamil
guerrillas. It said the pact made too many concessions to the
Tamils.
   India has at least 50,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka, off India's
southern coast, to disarm Tamil rebels and enforce the July 29
accord.
   India's population of 800 million includes 60 million Tamils.
   Athulathmudali, who is a Sinhalese, said he and People's
Liberation Front leader Rohana Wijeweera signed the peace
agreement. Wijeweera did not appear at the Cabinet minister's news
conference, but the front was represented by Kelly Senanayake, a
23-year-old lawyer.
   Senanayake said in an interview that 4,000 front members were in
prison and most would be released after the organization's
guerrillas surrender their weapons to the government.
   He said the guerrilas have not begun turning in their arms.
   Many of the victims of front guerrillas were government
officials.
   Authorities have blamed the front for two attacks on Sri Lankan
military installations and the assassinations of at least five
candidates for provincial elections in central and southern Sri
Lanka in recent weeks.
   The government said front guerrillas tried to assassinate
Jayewardene by exploding a bomb in Parliament last August.
Jayewardene escaped injury, but the blast killed two people and
injured several others, including Athulathmudali.

<HEAD>Guilty Verdict in `Trailside Slayings' Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A San Francisco man was convicted Tuesday of
first-degree murder in five killings thought to be part of the
``trailside slayings'' in northern California parks eight years ago.
   The jury also convicted David J. Carpenter, 58, of raping two of
his victims and trying to rape a third. The panel will reconvene
May 17 to decide whether Carpenter should be executed or spend the
rest of his life in prison.
   He already has been convicted and sentenced to the gas chamber
for two related 1981 murders in Santa Cruz County parks.
   The Marin killing spree left many popular hiking trails and
parks in northern California virtually deserted until Carpenter's
arrest in San Francisco in May 1981.
   The jury convicted Carpenter for the 1980 slayings of five
hikers in two Marin County parks, Point Reyes National Seashore and
Mount Tamalpais State Park. The trial was held in San Diego because
of extensive publicity in northern California.
   A ballistics expert said each victim was killed by a .38-caliber
bullet fired from the same weapon.
   The Superior Court jury returned the verdict at the end of its
second day of deliberations.
   ``That's an awful quick verdict in this case,'' Marin County
Deputy District Attorney John Posey said. ``It certainly seems to
suggest they didn't buy anything the defense presented.''
   ``It came as a surprise to have an unfavorable verdict as fast
as this,'' said Marin County public defender Frank Cox.
``(Carpenter) is philosophical about it.''
   Carpenter, who testified for eight days in his own defense,
showed no visible emotion as Superior Court Judge Herbert B.
Hoffman read the verdict.
   In his testimony, Carpenter had claimed he was miles away from
the crime scenes when the killings occurred.
   More than 500 items were entered into evidence, and 91 witnesses
testified during the four-month trial.
   Defense attorneys argued Carpenter deserved acquittal because of
serious doubts created by what they termed questionable police
procedures and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony linking
Carpenter to the undisputed murder weapon.
   The prosecution contended Carpenter was a cold-blooded killer
whose ultimate goal was to commit murder and rape and get away with
it.

<HEAD>Army Claims Victory Over Eritrean Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marxist government said Tuesday
its soldiers routed Eritrean rebels besieging a strategic town. It
was the first official report of an army victory in the northern
war.
   The government newspaper Ethiopia Herald said the battle
occurred recently near Keren, 55 miles from Asmara, the capital of
Eritrea province.
   Rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front have been
entrenched in hills around Keren since April and have tried several
times to capture it. The front has been fighting for independence
for the province for more than 25 years.
   The newspaper said the army ``made a significant breakthrough''
and was advancing after ``smashing'' the rebels.
   Its report indicated the army had begun the counterattack
President Mengistu Haile Mariam promised March 31. At that time he
acknowledged the war for the first time by saying soldiers were
involved in a ``grim struggle'' with guerrillas in the north.
   Rebels suffered heavy casualties in the battle at Keren, the
Herald said, but it gave no figures. It said the army captured
rocket launchers, ammunition and guns.
   Ethiopian journalists visited the front and were briefed by
field commanders who said army morale was ``unprecedently high,''
according to the newspaper report.
   Western diplomats in Ethiopia have reported low morale in the
military following a dispute between Mengistu and five top army
commanders. Mengistu purportedlu ordered at least one of the
commandersm put to death during a visit to the war zone in March.
   Eritrean rebels and those in neighboring Tigre province have
claimed many victories and captured several towns since launching
an offensive in February.
   Neither government nor rebel claims can be confirmed and both
sides often exaggerate.
   Tesfai Ghermazien, an Eritrean rebel spokesman in Washington,
D.C., claimed there had been no significant fighting around Keren
since a big battle 10 days ago in which the rebels claimed to have
killed or captured 860 soldiers.
   Apart from a few U.N. personnel in Asmara and several church
workers in both provinces, no Westerners remain in northern
Ethiopia since the government expulsion of foreign relief workers
April 6.
   The war and expulsions have endangered the lives of 3 million
drought victims in Eritrea and Tigre, the provinces most affected
by a drought that threatens 7 million people in Ethiopia.

   Voters delivered a split decision in
parliamentary elections Tuesday, leaving unresolved the dispute
over Denmark's ban on nuclear weapons and its allegiance to NATO.
   Complete results showed a small setback for the socialist
opposition but no gain for Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's
center-right minority coalition in the 179-member Folketing, or
Parliament.
   Schlueter had called the early election hoping to win a clear
endorsement of Denmark's ``full membership'' in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   The Social Democrats, Denmark's largest party, pushed through a
resolution in Parliament last month designed to reinforce a 1957
peacetime ban on nuclear weapons on Danish territory. Both the
United States and Britain had expressed opposition to the measure.
   Only the far-right Progress Party, campaigning for lower taxes
and less immigration, improved its standing. It won 16 seats, seven
more than it had held before.
   Schlueter's Conservative party dropped three seats, holding 35,
but they were picked up by other parties in the four-party
coalition and the alliance held on to its 70-seat total.
   The two-party socialist partnership lost two seats to command
79. The Social Democrats will hold 55 seats and the Socialist
People's Party 24.
   The swing party Social-Liberals held 10, a loss of one.
   Two semi-independent territories, the Faeroe Islands and
Greenland, each elect two representativs.
   Final results showed 3,913,318 ballts were cast for a turnout of
85.8 percent.
   Schlueter claimed the results would ease Denmark's crisis with
NATO.
   But Social Democratic leader Svend Auken said the election
showed most voters backed the anti-nuclear measure that requires
the government to notify visiting warships of Denmark's 1957 ban
against nuclear weapons during peacetime.
   Auken said he would continue the battle in the legislature to
implement the resolution. The precise wording of the letter to be
sent to ship captains remains to be drafted.
   Schlueter, in a television appearance, called on Auken to
quietly negotiate ``a sensible solution'' to the issue that
prompted the early election only eight months after the previous
balloting.
   Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the coalition's
Liberal Party, said he believed Schlueter's government could
continue.
   ``There is still a non-socialist majority,'' he told a
television interviewer. The other coalition members are the Center
Democratic and Christian People's parties.
   Twelve parties contested the election, but only nine won seats.
   Clearly elated, Progress Party leader Morgans Glistrup said his
victory ``was good for the country.''
   However, the party was not expected to be a factor in coalition
bargaining since it is shunned by mainstream politicians.
   Every Danish government since 1973 has lacked a majority in
Parliament, and Danish politics usually are managed through
backstage bargaining.
   Before the Social Democrat resolution passed last month, Denmark
took the position that its NATO allies abided by the rules
established in 1957.
   The United States and Britain said the measure threatened the
solidarity of the Western military alliance and was against their
own policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nuclear
arms.
   Britain said the Danish action jeopardized its plans to send
troops in times of crisis to reinforce Denmark, which controls the
narrow access to the Baltic Sea.
   Unless the resolution is overturned by the new Parliament, the
government will have to carry it out, after the wording has been
determined.
   Schlueter has indicated he would follow the Norwegian model.
Norway, also a NATO country with a peacetime nuclear ban, reminds
allies that their ships are expected to abide by Norwegian law but
does not explicitly mention nuclear weapons.
   The election came the day before Secretary of State George
Shultz was to meet Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in
Geneva to prepare for a Moscow summit in two weeks.
   The nuclear issue ``couldn't come at a worse time,'' said a
diplomat from a NATO country, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A perception that Denmark is wavering in its support of the
Western alliance could strenghthen the Soviets' hand.
   During the campaign, most coalition parties focused on the NATO
issue.
   However, the opposition stressed economic concerns, on which it
made some gains in the September election.

   The United States spends more for the defense
of NATO than do Western European nations, according to a
congressional study released Tuesday as part of a long-running
debate.
   The review was done by the Congressional Budget Office, which
conlcuded that ``while allied contributions are sometimes
substantial, the United States devotes a larger share of its
resources to the common defense than most of its allies.''
   The study was the latest round in the debate over financing the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   U.S. officials have argued that NATO nations, particularly in
Western Europe, need to do more for the alliance defense. But NATO
leaders have repeatedly answered that European countries do more
for NATO than Americans believe.
   The CBO study used a figure it defined as the gross domestic
product, which is the share of economic resources devoted by a
nation to its national security.
   By that standard, the CBO said, the United States devoted 6.7
percent of its gross domestic product to defense in 1986. By
comparison, the average for non-U.S. NATO countries was 3.3 percent
while Japan spent about 1 percent.
   The review also compared per capita defense spending and
concluded that in 1986, the United States spent $1,115 per person
for defense, compared to $318 in non-U.S. NATO countries and $163
for the Japanese.
   ``This gap has narrowed somewhat since 1986 because of the
decline in the value of the dollar, but remains substantial,'' the
CBO concluded. The study used 1986 because the CBO said that was
the last full year for which the data was available.
   European leaders have answered that the figures aren't accurate
because some European countries draft soldiers, unlike the United
States, which has an all-volunteer military. Those leaders have
argued that if their recruits weren't drafted, but were paid market
wages like in the United States, their defense budgets would thus
be higher.
   The CBO answered that ``conscription does reduce the defense
budgets of some allies, but it also results in a less experienced
military that may not be as productive or as well trained as a
volunteer military.''
   The United States has about 325,000 military personnel stationed
in Europe. The administration has successfully opposed efforts in
Congress to reduce that total unless U.S. allies spend more.

   A death-row inmate who requested a lump
of dirt for his final meal and insisted he wanted to be executed
early Wednesday was given a reprieve Tuesday by the U.S. Supreme
Court in an appeal by his mother.
   The high court granted the stay for James Smith about six hours
before the scheduled execution. No vote among the justices was
released.
   Alexzene Hamilton of Indianapolis filed the appeal with the
Supreme Court on Monday, contending her son was mentally
incompetent. Her attorneys also contended mitigating evidence was
not allowed to be considered by jurors who sentenced Smith to death.
   ``The order just says a stay was granted,'' Assistant Texas
Attorney General Bill Zapalac said. ``It's anybody's guess what
they mean.''
   ``I'm praising God right now,'' Mrs. Hamilton said. ``That's all
I can say, I just thank God.''
   Smith was informed of the development as he waited in a holding
cell next to the death chamber.
   ``When they told him about the stay ... he gritted his teeth and
said something unintelligible,'' said Texas Department of
Corrections spokesman Charles Brown.
   Brown said Smith was later transferred back to his usual cell.
   Smith would have been the 28th prisoner executed in Texas _ more
than any other state _ and the 99th nationally since the Supreme
Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976.
   Smith, 37, convicted of the 1983 robbery-slaying of a Houston
insurance office manager, has no attorney and has resisted attempts
for legal help from capital punishment opponents.
   ``I don't understand all this clinging to life,'' Smith said in
a recent interview. ``Life is a temporary situation. The spirit
moves on. Death is like eating a prune in the morning. It's a
natural function.''
   On Tuesday, he requested ``Rhaeakunda dirt'' for his final meal
_ a request Texas Department of Corrections officials said would
not be honored.
   ``It's not food, it's not sanitary,'' prison spokesman David
Nunnelee said. ``He'll be offered something off the regular prison
menu.''
   Officials could not immediately explain what was meant by the
type of dirt. Texas A&M University soil experts said it was not an
identifiable soil but believed it may be a dirt used in voodoo
rituals. In such rituals, the dirt is eaten, school spokeswoman
Mary Jo Powell said.
   Smith has said he believes in and has practiced voodoo.
   Smith, a former tarot-card dealer in New Orleans who was working
as a Houston taxi driver at the time of his arrest, was convicted
for the 1983 shooting death of Larry Rohus.
   Testimony showed he was tackled by witnesses while fleeing the
shooting scene and that a gun he was carrying was linked to the
slaying.
   Witnesses said Rohus, father of a 1-year-old son, complied with
Smith's demands and filled a small trash can with cash, then was
shot through the heart as he pleaded for his life.
   ``I don't think justice could ever be done totally,'' said
Rohus' wife, Deborah, who since has remarried and now lives in
North Carolina. ``The only way for that is for Larry to be alive
and that's not going to happen. I think ... this will help my son
when he grows up and is old enough to understand what's going on.''
   Smith repeatedly has said he is innocent, but says he does not
want to spend his life on death row.
   ``It's not craziness, it's determination,'' he said. ``Other
inmates say I'm crazy _ the strangest person they've run into _ but
that's because they don't understand my rationale. All my life I've
been a loner. I'm very good at doing that.''
   If he desired, Smith virtually was assured of an execution stay
from the Supreme Court because the high court is considering a
challenge to the Texas death penalty law.
   ``I have no forgiveness, I'm not sentimental,'' Smith said.
``Let me get my execution over and leave me alone.''

   Lech Walesa and 1,000 fellow workers left
the Lenin shipyard Tuesday night with heads held high but with no
settlement, declaring that their eight-day strike showed Poles they
must ``fight to win.''
   Bearing a cross and two Polish flags, they marched slowly from
the yard, the 1980 birthplace of Solidarity, shortly after 8 p.m.
(2 p.m. EDT). Police stepped back silently and let them pass.
   Townspeople applauded from balconies and sidewalks as the
procession walked three blocks to St. Brygida's Church, a
stronghold of Solidarity.
   As the workers approached, bells pealed and supporters rushed to
embrace Walesa and other strike leaders, offering them flowers and
kisses.
   ``We thank you. We thank you!,'' the crowd chanted.
   Walesa was a founder of Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first and
only independent trade union movement. The federation was outlawed
in 1982, but the workers declared Tuesday night, ``It's a new
spring for Solidarity.''
   Walesa was not among those who launched this strike on May 2,
but he vowed to be ``the last to leave.''
   At the church, Walesa shrugged off questions, saying only, ``No
freedom without Solidarity.'' After his wife Danuta embraced him,
he teased her: ``Who's taking care of the house?''
   The Walesas have eight children.
   Up to Tuesday night, police had kept a tight blockade around the
sprawling shipyard, whose towering cranes dominate the skyline of
this Baltic port city. ``We decided to make a sovereign decision to
leave the shipyard without an agreement with the authorities,''
said a statement issued by the strikers.
   The workers decided Tuesday evening to end the sit-in strike for
higher pay and union rights. The strike committee recommended the
move in a 13-2 vote, strikers said.
   It was the last in a string of five strikes that began April 25,
Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial law
crackdown.
   ``We are convinced that we were right in the protest against
relations in Poland, against treating us in a way that violates
human dignity, against the arrogance of the authorities who are
responsible for the crisis,'' the workers' statement said.
   ``Poland is deep in crisis and the authorities treat the country
as their own property. We leave not in triumph but with raised
heads. Our strike should make everybody aware that one has to fight
to win.''
   The statement concluded: ``It's a new spring for Solidarity.''
   ``I think we accomplished something. We gained general agreement
on the other side that we exist,'' said Piotr Konopka, an aide to
Walesa.
   Walesa, 44, and winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, still
works as an electrician at the 12,000-worker Lenin shipyard. Most
of his 1,000 followers who remained on strike to the end were in
their late teens and early 20s.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski of Gdansk, whose
intervention paved the way for the first talks with management
Saturday, expressed joy at the strikers' decision, saying:
   ``The strike ended at the initiative of the striking Polish
workers. I express my hope that the authorities will respect their
promises to guarantee their (workers') personal and professional
safety.''
   He said he hoped recently imprisoned activists now would be
released.
   The state-run news agency PAP briefly reported the men's
departure from the yard.
   State-run television announced the strike's end and showed
police pulling down banners in the deserted yard. There was no
immediate official statement. Nothing was said about when the
shipyard would reopen.
   Strike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski, a 62-year-old
engineer once imprisoned for leading a strike at the yard, said,
``We didn't lose anything. The Communists lost. ... I wanted to
avoid the police taking them out. There were many wonderful young
men there, and I could not allow them to be beaten.''
   ``Solidarity lives, fights and will win,'' said the Rev. Henryk
Jankowski, pastor of St. Brygida's and a Solidarity adviser, as
about 4,000 strikers and supporters gathered for a prayer service.
   Talks had broken off Monday after strikers rejected a management
offer that would have made them abandon their quest to legalize
Solidarity.
   After the alleged detention and beating of two striker couriers
late Monday, strikers complained of increasing difficulty in
getting food into the shipyard.
   Early Tuesday, government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the absence
of further strikes in Poland proved ``the strikes and protests have
not won the support of the working class and society.''
   Referring to the 1980-81 labor turmoil, he said workers decided
``not to enter the same river twice, a river in which we all caught
a bad cold.''
   The strikers had demanded monthly raises of at least $38 based
on their current average of about $105; reinstatement of fired
Solidarity activists, recognition of a Solidarity local at the
yard, freedom for political prisoners and amnesty for strikers.
   They announced a new demand Tuesday: ``Preservation of the
shipyard in its present status.'' It came after management said the
yard's future was uncertain because of financial difficulties.
   Walesa, who led the hostoric August 1980 strike, initially
distanced himself from this stoppage. But he was gradually drawn
into it and the younger generation of workers _ the backbone of the
strike _ treated him as unofficial leader.
   Police staged a raid Thursday to crush a strike at the Lenin
steelworks in Nowa Huta in southern Poland.
   Other strikes in the labor unrest were settled peacefully: at a
heavy machinery plant in Stalowa Wola, and by transit workers in
the cities of Bydgoszcz and Szczecin.
   On Tuesday, Urban told his weekly news conference in Warsaw the
government was retreating from a proposal to ban all strikes.

   A Navy man accused of an AIDS-related
assault against his former fiancee insisted Tuesday he warned her
he was carrying the AIDS virus before they had sex in his barracks
room.
   In the second day of his court-martial, Petty Officer 2nd Class
John E. Crawford also said he wore a condom to protect Jeannie
Elmer on the night of April 15, 1987.
   The case is the first of its kind in the Navy, according to Lt.
Cmdr. George Farrar, a spokesman at Treasure Island Naval Station.
An Army private is charged in another AIDS-related assault case,
which resumes Wednesday at Fort Huachuca, Ariz.
   Crawford is charged with having unprotected sex with Elmer
without telling her he had tested positive for the AIDS virus. He
is also charged with adultery, because Elmer was separated but not
divorced from her third husband at the time.
   If convicted, Crawford, 27, could be dishonorably discharged,
stripped of rank and sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars.
   Elmer, 28, has tested negative three times for antibodies to the
virus. The test tells if a person is carrying the virus, but
scientists don't know what percentage of those infected will
eventually develop the deadly disease.
   Crawford said Elmer reacted calmly when he told her he had
tested positive. ``She didn't ask no questions. She just sat
there,'' Crawford said.
   The Magnolia, Ark., native said Elmer watched television for a
few minutes, then came over to him and sat in his lap. ``She said
she'd take care of me and that everything would be all right,''
Crawford said.
   They undressed, he donned a condom and they had sex, he said.
   But a few days later, he said, she confronted him, denied he
told her about the AIDS test and accused him of trying to kill her
and her two children.
   ``I didn't know what to think. I was afraid. I knew she heard
me. I know I said it,'' Crawford said. ``She said, `I can burn
you.'''
   Crawford said Elmer then repeated that she loved him and wanted
to take care of him and have his children. Then, he said, he
proposed marriage because, ``I thought it would keep her from
turning me in.''
   He broke off the engagement a few weeks later, but she continued
to pursue him, Crawford told the military judge and the
seven-member jury.
   Earlier in the day, Elmer's former housemate, Yolande
LaMagdeleine testified she told Elmer about Crawford's test results
the night after Elmer had been with the sailor.
   LaMagdeleine, who said she also had been Crawford's lover, said,
``She said she was going to kill him.'' But minutes earlier,
LaMagdeleine testified that Elmer did not appear that upset about
Crawford's test results.
   ``She acted not like I did when I found out. ... I was
hysterical,'' LaMagdeleine said.
   She said Elmer felt Crawford ``owed her something'' after he
broke off their brief engagement. Elmer then decided to file
charges, LaMagdeleine said.

<HEAD>Noriega Meets with US Lawyers about Drug Indictments</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with lawyer comment; CORRECTS only two

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega met with
his Florida lawyers Tuesday to discuss strategy in seeking
dismissal of U.S. indictments that charge him with drug trafficking.
   Noriega engaged lawyers Raymond Takiff, Frank Rubino and Steve
Kollin after the indictments were handed up in February. Takiff and
Rubino flew to Panama Monday night.
   After the meeting, Rubino described Noriega as ``very
encouraged'' by developments in the case and ``very confident''
about having weathered U.S. pressure to oust him. ``At the moment
there are no plans for his retirement,'' Rubino said.
   The United States is trying to force Noriega to resign as
commander of Panama's military and police, the position from which
he controls the civilian government.
   Washington has applied several types of economic pressure since
Noriega dismissed President Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26, the
day after Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   According to Noriega, the Reagan administration wants him out
because of his opposition to what he calls efforts in the United
States to retain control of the Panama Canal.
   Under the 1977 canal treaties, the United States must relinquish
control of the canal by midnight Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega won his first legal battle last month when Judge William
Hooveler ruled he did not have to appear in a Florida court for
hearings on his challenge of the indictments.
   Rubino said the lawyers spent ``quite a few hours'' with Noriega
on Tuesday, ``told him the good news of our recent court victory
and discussed our plan of action.''
   He said he and his colleagues will appear in court in ``about a
month'' to request dismissal of the indictments.
   Officials initially said the third lawyer, Kollin, was also in
Panama for the meeting. They later said he was not.

   Pope John Paul II attacked birth control,
abortion, divorce and the local Indian practice of concubinage
Tuesday in a Mass celebrated 2{ miles above sea level in South
America's poorest country.
   Facing snow-capped Andean peaks soaring to 21,000 feet, the
pontiff intoned from a flower-festooned altar in the native Aymara
dialect: ``Don't thieve, don't slacken, don't lie.''
   The Mass took place in a muddy field near La Paz's international
airport in the suburb of El Alto (The Heights), 13,150 feet above
sea level. Afterward, the pope flew to the mountain city of
Cochabamba, 150 miles to the southeast, to rest for the night.
   Bolivian police, meanwhile, said two American men were arrested
in South Africa with explosives, a small plane and a flight plan
that corresponded to part of the pope's schedule. They said they
learned of the arrests through an Interpol alert and decided to
tighten security for the pope. It was not clear whether the men's
plans were linked to John Paul's trip.
   In La Paz, a searing sun beat down on the huge crowd, estimated
by Roman Catholic Church officials at 300,000 but by journalists at
200,000. Throughout the Mass stretcher-bearing Red Cross volunteers
carried away people who had fainted from exposure. Many had been at
the site since before dawn.
   Upon arrival at the field, John Paul greeted groups of the
elderly, the blind and the crippled, including a 12-year-old polio
victim named Gonzalo who was wearing leg braces. Church officials
said Gonzalo worked with his father in the jungle crushing coca
leaves, the first step in making cocaine.
   John Paul's sermon stressed the importance of the family. He
told parents ``not to flee from family obligations by putting your
heart in other goals _ such as work, social or political problems _
or, worse yet, seeking refuge in excessive drinking or other
degrading habits or in a feminine liberation that does not promote
women, but rather subjugates them even more.''
   ``Birth control is a falsification of human love,'' the pope
said. He called abortion ``a serious violation of moral order and
of human rights.''
   He urged Bolivians ``not to be seduced by easy recourse to
divorce,'' which is legal in the South American country. Abortion
is illegal but is believed to be commonly practiced.
   The pope criticized the centuries-old Aymara practice of
``sirvinacuy,'' or living together and having children without
marrying. He said this was ``contrary to God's wishes and to
natural law.''
   Some Aymaras in the audience were heard to mutter, in their
language, ``I don't understand, Father.'' The local Catholic Church
has largely accepted the practice, since most such couples remain
together for life.
   In general the atmosphere was festive. Near the altar a group of
Aymara Indians in bright red ponchos and gaily colored wool hats
with earflaps played traditional music on windpipes and an
accordian. The crowd cheered and sang songs composed in honor of
the pontiff's visit.
   As he climbed the 25-foot-high altar, decorated with greenery
and bouquets of red flowers, the pope halted twice to catch his
breath in the thin air.
   It was the highest papal Mass ever said, Vatican officials said.
   Earlier in the day, in an address to diplomats in La Paz, the
pope criticized creditor banks for making big profits on loans to
Third World countries mired in debt.
   ``The imbalance between the amount of this debt and the capacity
to pay it, the difference between the sums loaned and the profits
demanded by creditors, is causing very grave damage to many poor
countries,'' he said.
   ``The abysmal differences between rich and poor countries are
incompatible with divine designs of a just and equal sharing of the
goods of creation,'' the pontiff said.
   Bolivia's foreign debt is $4.2 billion, about eight times the
country's annual export earnings. It is South America's poorest
country, with a minimum wage of about $35 a month.
   In Cochabamba, Col. Freddy Cespedes of the national police said
Interpol reported that two men had been arrested in an unspecified
location in South Africa. They planned to fly to Cochabamba, La Paz
and Lima, Peru, he said.
   ``We don't know if they were coming because of the pope or for
drug trafficking,'' Cespedes told a news conference.
   The pope arrived Monday night in Bolivia, the second stop of a
13-day tour of four South American countries. He came from Uruguay
and will leave on Saturday for Peru and Paraguay.

   Drug-related violence has surged in the inner
city, with seven shootings in four days leaving two men dead,
several others wounded and police pleading for more gun controls.
   The city also has been stunned by the recent arrest of a
12-year-old boy who allegedly helped sell cocaine.
   Police have made several arrests in the shootings, and believe
some of the suspects may be linked to more than one of the
incidents.
   ``Drugs and guns go hand-in-hand,'' said Police Deputy
Superintendent James Woods, who directs the city's drug control
unit. ``Drugs are a violent business and guns don't help. There are
just too many guns out there. People are going to have to change
the gun laws.''
   Woods said cocaine appears to be at the center of most of the
shootings. He said crack, a potent derivative of cocaine, is still
not as prevalent in Boston as in larger cities such as New York and
Los Angeles.
   ``Things are just coming to a head,'' said Georgette Watson, who
heads an anti-drug tip line in Roxbury, an economically depressed
section of the city south of downtown. ``Drugs have been plaguing
the inner city for a long time. But now it's just exploded and sad
to say, it's just the beginning. People are very fearful about the
warm weather.''
   On Friday, when two men were seriously wounded by shotgun blasts
in Roxbury, police arrested a 12-year-old boy in the nearby
Dorchester neighborhood for allegedly working as a runner for a
cocaine dealer. Police said the boy had a packet of cocaine in a
pocket of his sweat pants and told officers, ``Lots of kids sell
drugs.''
   On Saturday night, William Medina, 26, and Antonio Reis, 22,
were shot to death while sitting in a parked car. Thirty minutes
later, two other men were fired upon on a nearby street but escaped
unharmed.
   ``Whether this is just a blip or a trend, it's hard to tell,''
said police spokesman Jim Jordan. ``But we know it has to do with
handguns being a lot more plentiful, a lot easier to get.''
   Two suspects arrested in the second Saturday night shooting,
Philip Brown, 24, and Tony Williams, 27, are also being
investigated in connection with the double murder, Jordan said
Tuesday.
   Brown and Williams pleaded innocent in Roxbury District Court to
charges of armed assault with intent to murder. Each was being held
Tuesday on $100,000 cash bail.
   Police had no suspects in the Monday afternoon shooting of Jose
Hernandez, 19, Jordan said. Hernandez was shot in the head in a
Roxbury parking lot and was listed in critical but stable condition
Tuesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   Three more men were shot and wounded in separate incidents
Monday evening in Roxbury and nearby sections, and two 19-year-olds
from Roxbury were charged in connection with one of the shootings,
police said.
   The rash of violence occurred despite an almost yearlong effort
by Boston police's ``power patrol,'' a 23-officer unit that
monitors the Roxbury area and concentrates on drug locations.
   In February 1985, a drug war broke out in Roxbury between local
people and a New York street gang that came to Boston to run
heroin. There have been flare-ups among other gangs seeking to
control the lucrative traffic, but officials said they do not
believe the latest incidents were gang-related.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Bob Kerrey easily won the
Democratic nomination for Senate on Tuesday, while on the
Republican side, Sen. David Karnes was in a neck-and-neck race with
Rep. Hal Daub after a bitter, divisive campaign.
   Karnes, the nation's youngest senator at 39, was appointed to
the job 14 months ago and running in his first election. Daub, 47,
has represented the Omaha area in Congress for eight years.
   With 40 percent of the vote counted, Karnes had 23,926 votes or
50.7 percent and Daub had 23,248 votes or 49.3 percent.
   The popular Kerrey had only token opposition from disbarred
lawyer Ken Michaelis and was burying him 39,829 votes or 91.3
percent to 3,807 votes or 8.7 percent.
   In the presidential primaries, Vice President George Bush, who
already has locked up the GOP nomination, faced no active
opposition for 25 GOP delegates; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
led Jesse Jackson in the race for 25 Democratic delegates.
   Voters in Daub's 2nd District also decided wide-open races in
both parties. The leader among four Democrats was Cece Zorinsky,
widow of Sen. Edward Zorinsky. Four Republicans were seeking their
party's nomination.
   And Nebraska voters decided whether to give lawmakers in the
nation's only one-chamber Legislature their first pay raise in 20
years, from $4,800 to $12,000 a year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Karnes, who had never before held public office, was appointed
by Republican Gov. Kay Orr to fill the vacancy created by
Zorinsky's death in March 1987.
   Daub, who had wanted the Senate appointment himself, mounted an
aggressive campaign against Karnes, prompting some GOP leaders to
dub him a ``pit bull.''
   Last week, Daub charged that Karnes was a ``rubber stamp'' for
Mrs. Orr and President Reagan. Karnes said he refused to be drawn
into negative campaigning, and Mrs. Orr said it was ``sad'' that
Daub was resorting to ``desperate'' tactics.
   An Omaha World-Herald poll taken the week before the primary
showed 41 percent of those polled preferred Karnes, while 40
percent backed Daub and the remainder were undecided. A Lincoln
Journal poll found Daub leading Karnes by a margin of 42 percent to
41 percent, with 17 percent undecided.
   The margin of error in the World-Herald poll was 4 percentage
points, and 6.4 percentage points in the Journal polls.
   Kerrey, 44, was elected governor in 1982 in his first bid for
elective office. He chose not to run in 1986.
   The last senator defeated in a primary was Richard Stone, a
Florida Democrat who lost in an Oct. 7, 1980, runoff to Democrat
Bill Gunter. Gunter was defeated that November by Republican Paula
Hawkins.

   Former Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie, who ushered in
the state income tax and may have paid for it by losing his
re-election bid in 1972, died Tuesday, a day after a massive heart
attack and emergency bypass surgery.
   The 65-year-old Republican suffered irreparable damage to his
heart, said officials at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where
Ogilvie was taken after he was stricken at his downtown law office
Monday.
   Ogilvie never regained consciousness after a second cardiac
arrest and a quadruple bypass operation, the hospital said. His
wife, Dorothy, and his daughter, Elizabeth, were at the hospital
when he died.
   ``He always spoke his mind and had the strength of character to
stand behind issues he believed in, such as the state's first
income tax,'' Gov. James R. Thompson said Tuesday.
   ``Dick Ogilvie has been a superior and courageous public servant
by any standard,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who served as
Ogilvie's lieutenant governor. ``Many thought we would not get
along. But we had a remarkably good working relationship.''
   Ogilvie, a Republican, was elected governor in 1968 and served
until 1973, when he was succeeded by Democrat Dan Walker, who had
won with 51 percent of the vote.
   His narrow re-election loss to Walker was attributed in part to
the 1969 enactment of the state's first income tax, which Ogilvie
listed among his accomplishments.
   Ogilvie, a former federal prosecutor, made a fast rise in
Chicago politics.
   In 1962 he defeated then-Mayor Richard J. Daley's candidate for
sheriff and in 1966 was elected president of the Cook County Board.
   Ogilvie ran for governor in 1968, overwhelming Peoria
industrialist John Henry Altorfer in the GOP primary and then
defeating Democratic incumbent Sam Shapiro with 51.2 percent of the
vote in the general election.
   Ogilvie's supporters have said his accomplishments included a
major highway construction program and upgraded public health,
penal and law-enforcement systems. Critics said the road program
was riddled with politics.
   In recent years, Ogilvie won praise for his handling of the
Milwaukee Road bankruptcy, considered one of the most successful
rail bankruptcy reorganizations. He was named trustee of the
Chicago Missouri & Western Railway Co., which has been under
federal bankruptcy reorganization since April.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer had been preparing to name Ogilvie chairman
of the Chicago Housing Authority, the city's troubled public
housing agency.
   ``Governments are constantly seeking him to solve insurmountable
problems,'' Cook County County Commissioner Harold Tyrrell said
Monday after hearing of Ogilvie's heart attack. ``When you got to
the point where it seemed insurmountable, you called for Dick.''
   In 1958, he left corporate law to head a special U.S. Justice
Department crime-fighting unit in Chicago, where he won a
conviction of mob leader Tony Accardo on income tax-evasion charges.
   The conviction was reversed by a federal appeals court, which
held that publicity might have biased the jurors.
   After the 1972 election, Ogilvie joined the law firm of Isham,
Lincoln & Beale, where he was working Monday.
   Ogilvie was chairman of Gerald Ford's Illinois presidential
campaign in 1976 when Ford defeated Ronald Reagan in the state's
primary and then carried the state in the general election.

   George Bush's defense on his two biggest
campaign liabilities, the Iran-Contra affair and alleged drug
dealing by Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, is the same: a
plea of ignorance.
   On both counts, the Republican presidential candidate sounds
alike:
   _Although he once headed the Central Intelligence Agency and a
presidential task force on drugs, he says he didn't know Noriega
was involved in alleged drug trafficking until this past February,
when a U.S. indictment was handed down in Florida.
   _Even though a member of the National Security Council, he says
he had no hint that U.S. arms were being sold to Iran in an effort
to free hostages, or that proceeds were funnelled illegally to the

Either he knew more than he's admitting, in which case he's not

   As Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
prepares for a likely fall campaign, Vice President George Bush
isn't the only one going after him. Dukakis has the likes of
Dorothea Thomas-Vitrac to contend with too.
   Thomas-Vitrac's dispute with the Massachusetts governor is
strictly a local affair. But she _ like other political enemies of
Dukakis _ intends to do what she can to disrupt the governor's
presidential bid in order to make her point. As Dukakis comes under
increasing scrutiny, that task becomes easier and easier.
   Thomas-Vitrac is a member of the board of selectmen in the tiny
western Massachusetts town of New Braintree, where Dukakis has
proposed building a 500-bed prison. She has led the fight against
it.

   A woman was found guilty of killing her husband
and a woman to collect more than $175,000 in insurance, and the
prosecutor says the conviction in the nation's first
death-by-product-tampering trial will stop drug tamperers.
   Stella Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn, was convicted Monday of
all five counts in the deaths of her 52-year-old husband, Bruce,
and Sue Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn.
   Federal court jurors, who deliberated nearly five days, said
Mrs. Nickell's daughter's testimony against her mother proved
crucial. Mrs. Nickell, scheduled for sentencing June 17, could
receive life in prison. Prosecutors also are considering state
murder charges.

   The 1988 Tony nominations reflected Broadway's
best season in years with more than enough nominees to fill most of
the categories and even to allow for some unexpected omissions.
   As usual, musicals, particularly, Andrew Lloyd Webber's lavish
``Phantom of the Opera,'' Stephen Sondheim's fairy tale ``Into the
Woods'' and a revival of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes'' dominated
the nominations announced Monday.
   Each of the three shows received 10 nominations, with
``Phantom'' and ``Into the Woods'' going against ``Romance
Romance,'' two small one-act musicals, and the South African
musical ``Sarafina!'' for best musical of the 1987-88 season. Left
out of the nominations was ``Chess,'' the big British musical by
Tim Rice and members of the pop group ABBA. It received only two
acting nominations.

   Robert A. Heinlein, who spent a half
century writing about man's relation to technology, society and the
universe, was remembered upon his death at age 80 as science
fiction's prolific ``grand master.''
   ``He was probably the best of us all at his peak,'' Isaac
Asimov, one of the top science fiction writers, said Monday. ``He
forged the route the rest of us followed.
   ``His early stories in the 1940s were so far ahead of everything
else being done that he made an enduring name for himself as the
best science fiction writer.''
   Heinlein, whose books explored the future while questioning the
morals and beliefs of the present, died of heart failure Sunday at
his home in this seaside community 130 miles south of San Francisco.
   Heinlein suffered for years from emphysema and had undergone
numerous operations, including one to relieve restricted blood flow
to his brain.

   A senior Reagan administration official voiced
confidence Tuesday that Secretary of State George P. Shultz would
be able to clear up differences over a missile-ban treaty with the
Soviet Union in a new round of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze.
   The differences over policing the accord against cheating
prompted Senate leaders on Monday to indefinitely postpone
ratification.
   ``These are very, very technical issues, and we've had the
problem of pursuing them at long distance through diplomatic
exchange, informal translations, things of that sort,'' the
official told reporters before Shultz boarded an Air Force jet for
two days of talks with Shevardnadze in Geneva.

   Ronald Reagan, always a soft touch for a
personal anecdote, was convinced of the need to radically overhaul
the nation's tax law when told that his secretary paid more in
taxes than 60 of the largest U.S. corporations, Donald Regan writes
in his new book.
   The president's former treasury secretary and ex-chief of staff
takes much of the credit for passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act,
considered the major domestic achievement of Reagan's second term.
   In ``For the Record,'' which went on sale Monday, Regan writes
that the idea of simplifying the tax code by closing loopholes and
lowering tax rates was moribund when he took the cause to Reagan at
a White House meeting in late 1983.

   The military shouldn't become deeply involved
in fighting illegal drugs because soldiers aren't properly trained

Congress on Tuesday.
   ``I do not believe law enforcement, making arrests, is
appropriate'' for the military, Carlucci said. ``I think it is
unwise to get the military into the law enforcement question.''
   ``Do we shoot people? Do we shoot down planes?'' he said at a

   Carlucci was trying to deal with a rising wave of sentiment in
Congress that the military should be used more heavily to block the

<HEAD>Video Craze Sweeping Eastern Europe has Communist Officials
Worried</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Video mania is gripping Eastern Europe,
brought on by a booming black market in VCRs and a desire of
millions to see movies banned in state-controlled theaters.
   Clearly worried, the communist governments are going on the
attack against them, but at the same time they are trying to corner
some of the lucrative market.
   In Poland, some Roman Catholic parishes organize video showings
of religious and dissident films, and they draw large audiences.
   Any Hungarian can get a fill of gut-wrenching violence, group
sex, anti-Soviet sentiment and other East bloc taboos.
   A newspaper in Romania shocked readers recently with the account
of a rapist who lured a victim to his home by offering to show her
Sylvester Stallone in ``Rambo.''
   ``Video is a powerful weapon,'' the Czechoslovak Communist Party
daily Rude Pravo said recently.
   ``Video must no longer pass unnoticed,'' complained the Polish
weekly Politika. ``Its scale has become far too big. The video
market has managed to escape any control by the state and perhaps
this is the reason why it is flourishing.''
   According to semiofficial estimates, at least 2 million video
recorders have made their way into the six Soviet bloc countries,
which have a total population of about 110 million.
   The scarcity of video recorders and the lure of the independent
entertainment they offer means millions of East Europeans are
hunting for VCRS.
   East Europeans who travel to the West often buy VCRs for
themselves or to sell on the black market back home where they
fetch many times their Western price.
   In Romania and Bulgaria, for example, an inexpensive Western VCR
can cost the equivalent on the black market of $4,500 _ 15 times
the average monthly salary.
   In East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, VCRs are
available in special hard-currency stores, with prices ranging from
$400 in Poland to $1,200 in East Germany.
   ``It's a lot of money, but it's the best entertainment we've got
and a kind of escape from the daily fare of state-owned culture,''
said a doctor in Romania, where the state television is on the air
just two hours a day on weekdays.
   Like other East Europeans with friends or relatives in the West,
the doctor paid a hefty customs duty _ $700 _ to get a Japanese VCR
sent by his sister in West Germany.
   The demand matches the high prices.
   In Bucharest, the classified-ad pages of the government
newspaper Romania Libera are devoted almost exclusively to offers
to buy or sell videos.
   In Poland, public video showings have moved from X-rated films
like ``Emmanuelle,'' ''Caligula'' and ``120 Days of Sodom'' to
regular shows in cultural centers in housing projects or villages
that have no movie theaters.
   The Polish underground publishing house Nowa has released at
least 12 video cassettes, including the American movies ``Moscow on
the Hudson'' and ``Sophie's Choice.''
   It also has distributed banned Polish films, such as Ryszard
Bugajski's ``Przesluchania'' (The Interrogation), which is about a
woman imprisoned in the Stalinist era.
   Some Catholic parishes in Poland have VCRs, which they use for
public showings of religious and other films. A church in Bialystok
had an Easter showing of ``Yentl,'' the Barbra Streisand movie
about Jews in Poland.
   The Polish underground publication Video Narcomania estimated
last year that more than 70 percent of video cassettes in Poland
are pure escapism: pornography, science fiction, horror movies,
other thrillers and comedies.
   That pattern holds across the bloc, where the most popular
movies are Western box-office hits like ``Top Gun'' or ``Platoon.''
Recordings of American television series like ``Dallas'' and
``Dynasty'' are also well-liked, as is soft porn and anti-communist
films such as ``Rambo II'' and ``Rocky IV.''
   Apparently trying to channel popular interest toward ``less
noxious'' themes, Czechoslovakia's Rude Pravo assailed the popular
taste in videos.
   ``Video programs on the black market are creations exploiting
the lowest instincts of sexuality and inhuman violence,'' it said.
``VCR owners admire low quality movies full of blood until late at
night in copies that are hard to watch.''
   Throughout the bloc, people can watch up to four badly copied
movies a night at private video parties.
   In Romania, a Western, a porno movie and a cup of coffee costs
$16, almost 20 times more than a ticket to a state movie theater.
   Official efforts seem unlikely to stop the video craze anytime
soon, and communist governments have taken some steps to get in on
the profits.
   In Czechoslovakia, a joint venture has been established using
components and know-how from the Dutch company Philips to produce
100,000 VCRs a year.
   Throughout Eastern Europe, authorities have produced
ideologically acceptable movies for the VCR, set up rental services
and levied steep fees on imported material.
   Repression is also used. More than 100 semiofficial rental shops
in Poland are now being liquidated under a 1987 law tightening
control on the video market.
   In Lodz, some private Polish video-library owners face trial on
charges of piracy, and one case has been reported of a VCR owner
having his machine confiscated for screening porno.

<HEAD>Actual Facts Are Le Grand Poot-On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PECK, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is it ``le grand poot-on'' or an actual fact?
   Item: ``If diluted thinly enough, the juice of one lemon would
cover the entire state of Oregon.''
   Item: ``The food spilled from tacos in a single afternoon would
fill the shoes of everyone in Norway.''
   As it turns out, both items are ``actual facts'' Cully Abrell
and John Thompson have compiled in their new book, ``Moses May Have
Been An Apache and Other Actual Facts,'' a tongue-in-cheek tome
that just may be the next best thing to chopped liver this summer.
   The Main Street Press of Pittstown, N.J., has issued 50,000
copies of their new book, ``Moses May Have Been An Apache and Other
Actual Facts.'' The Waldenbooks chain bought 15,000.
   Each pair of hand-lettered ``facts'' in the book is accompanied
by drawings reminiscent of Robert Ripley's ``Believe It Or Not''
panels. Thompson produced the black ink artwork and wrote the text
with Abrell. They call the book ``le grand poot-on, not to be
confused with la petite crouton.''
   ``In England they would simply be called eccentrics,'' said
their publisher, Martin Grife. ``In America, they might be called
nut cases. I think they are far saner than we are, though they
definitely are characters.''
   Grife describes the book as ``humor for the intelligent reader.''
   ``You have to have some knowledge about the world to understand
what's funny about `Actual Facts,''' he said. ``And if you don't
think they're cleverly written, try dropping or changing a word or
two.''
   Abrell and Thompson aren't very forthcoming when asked to
explain the genesis of individual entries.
   ``Because of recent findings in a dig near Tucson,
archaeologists now believe Moses to have been an Apache,'' the book
says.
   ``They both wandered the desert, didn't they?'' Abrell said.
   ``If placed inside President Taft, President Wilson would have
stuck out a total of 18 inches,'' the book says.
   ``Statistics taken to their ultimate extreme,'' notes Thompson.
   The recurring themes in the book include musk oxen, snakes,
presidents, potatoes and Grosvenor, Utah.
   ``With a good actual fact, there's a certain irritant value,''
Abrell said, acknowledging people have divergent reactions. ``Some
fall on the floor laughing, and some sit as if you're speaking
Lithuanian.''
   Abrell, 60, lists 40 some occupations on his resume, ranging
from bartender to North Woods guide to lifeguard. He taught drama
at Wichita's Friends University for 19 years before retiring in
1982 when declining enrollment, money and facility problems forced
the elimination of his department.
   Thompson, 36, is a former student of Abrell's who sometimes
works as a free-lance artist.
   ``Unlike Mr. Abrell, however, Mr. Thompson has never really
gotten started at anything, and now seems pretty much to have given
up. He has a degree in art,'' his ``Actual Facts'' biography says.
   The two live in an old farmhouse on a 16-acre plot, much of
which was reclaimed from wheat fields. A huge barn is being
remodeled into new living quarters. Outbuildings bulge with the
fruits of frequent garage sale trips. About 60 chickens and five
confident roosters roam the grounds.
   The Abrell-Thompson phone is listed under a fake American Indian
name.
   During a recent interview, Abrell slipped frequently into an
Irish accent. He attributed the lapses to his ``mixed ancestry''
rather than the rum, apricot brandy and sangria he had been
consuming to soothe a sore throat. The reclusive Thompson spent
much of the interview looking at newspaper advertisements for lawn
mowers.
   Abrell said a sampler of ``Actual Facts'' was shipped off to
five publishers with a note: ``Is there a market for more of
these?''
   ``We got back one rejection slip. We got back another that said,
`We only deal through agents.' We haven't yet heard from the other
two,'' Abrell said.
   ``And Martin wrote us a letter that said: `Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes,''' Thompson said.
   The two balk at the idea of a book promotion tour, book-signing
parties or telephone interviews on radio talk shows. But Abrell
uses his best stage voice and draws on his carnival days when
talking up the tome.
   ``In this age of Trivial Pursuit, this is the archetypal,
ultimate _ not penultimate _ compendium of knowledge,'' he said.
``I don't think any household should be without one, particularly
if there is a child in school, or if one of the parents has ever
gone to school or if they've known anyone who can spell the word
`school.'''

<HEAD>Tatoos, `Yahoos!' And `Alabama Martinis' Set Scene on Redneck

<TEXT>
   An ``Alabama martini'' is a
powerhouse concoction that includes neither gin nor vermouth. Its
principal ingredients involve beer, a large funnel and a 2-foot
length of plastic hose.
   Get the idea? If not, Ila Waite, a bemused local observer, will
be happy to spell it out.
   ``They pour the beer into the funnel, stick the hose in their
mouths and swallow the contents in a single gulp,'' she said,
sitting at a beachfront bar in this Florida panhandle town. ``It's
a very popular drink on Saturday nights, when the fellows from
southern Georgia and L.A. _ that's Lower Alabama _ come down here
to party.''
   Welcome to the Redneck Riveria. As the lyrics of a popular local
song explain: ``It ain't no Monte Carlo. It ain't no Vegas night.
It's cutoff jeans and bikini queens and a slice of Dixie delight.''
   But in the decade since singer-song writer Madison ``Shine''
Powell first captured the special Southern-fried ambience along 130
miles of sugar-fine white sand and sparkling blue water stretching
from Panama City Beach to Gulf Shores, Ala., much has changed.
   High-rise condominiums now draw hordes of tourists to the Gulf
of Mexico beaches. Fancy restaurants and gleaming hotels rise amid
the seedy bars, tacky motels, water slides, T-shirt shops and
miniature golf courses.
   As a result, the term Redneck Riveria, one of endearment to
Powell and many other longtime residents, has become taboo among
local politicians and Chamber of Commerce types.
   The Gulf Shores City Council at one point considered outlawing
use of the term inside city limits but was advised such a ban would
be unconstitutional.
   ``We did have that redneck label several years ago but it really
doesn't fit us anymore,'' said Judy Norris, a Gulf Shores Chamber
of Commerce official. ``We now have all the latest conveniences and
most modern vacation accommodations.''
   Norris said the community now prefers to be called ``The
American Rivieria.''
   Whatever the tag, spring break and summer vacation revive the
raucous nightlife in Gulf Shores and Panama City Beach, the polar
hot spots of the Redneck Riviera.
   ``Saturday night is really something to see, this time of year,
when the pickup trucks and customized cars are backed up, bumper to
bumper, along the beach highway,'' said Waite, a special education
teacher who moved to the Gulf Coast five years ago from Lansing,
Mich.
   ``The good ol' boys sit in their trucks waving their Confederate
flags out the windows and drinking Alabama martinis. Then, after a
big gulp, they let out a belch and a rebel yell.''
   Julie Binford, owner of the Euphoria Lounge where Waite was
holding forth, laughed as she picked up the conversation.
   ``The traffic gets so thick that they can jump out of their
trucks and come in for a restroom stop and a beer. And when they go
back outside, the truck they're riding in won't have moved more
than 30 feet,'' said Binford, a transplanted Oregonian who said she
used to keep a dictionary behind the bar to help her customers with
the meaning of euphoria.
   ``It's those yells that I find funny,'' said Waite. ``We call
them mating calls. The boys will see some girls and scream,
`YA-HOO' and the girls will answer back, `EEH-HA.'''
   The nights become more serene as one heads west out of Panama
City Beach to beachside communities such as Destin and Fort Walton.
As the honky tonks grow fewer, the shore still sprouts high-rise
condos, including a towering, 21-story affair in the village of
Seagrove, halfway between Panama City Beach and Pensacola.
   Until recently, Gulf Coast developers could build more or less
where they chose. But lawsuits brought by environmental groups and
a deflated real estate market have brought more stringent land-use
codes and a slowdown in development.
   Despite the development, it's the area's natural charms, which
include some of the whitest beaches and clearest water in North
America, that make it so popular with rednecks and Northerners
alike.
   Squadrons of pelicans, flying in tight formation, patrol the
beach. Hordes of quick-stepping sandpipers skip along the
waterline, and dolphins frolic a few feet offshore.
   On the riviera's western end, the state border is marked by the
FloraBama Bar, a sprawling establishment of wood and brick. Located
just a few feet inside the Florida line, which allows it to open
Sundays, the bar signals re-entry to redneck territory.
   ``If you're lookin' for the Redneck Riviera, this is it,'' said
Buddy Wells, a bearded bartender at the FloraBama, where one famous
good ol' boy, former pro football quarterback Kenny ``The Snake''
Stabler, sometimes stops by to pass the time.
   Stabler, who lives at nearby Ono Island, wasn't in residence
this day, but Ron Lacy, a sun-burned construction worker,
volunteered that ``The Snake'' has retained his redneck ways.
   ``Us Alabamians don't mind admitting we're rednecks,'' Lacy
said. ``But some Floridians, especially those folks over around
Pensacola, why it nearly kills them to admit it.''
   Yet even Shine Powell, a marine biologist when he's not singing
in honky tonks, acknowledges the area's nightlife has toned down
since 1979, when Hurricane Frederick wiped out most of the bars,
beach cottages and fishing shacks along the shore and set the stage
for the onslaught of condos.
   ``I know that the council and Chamber of Commerce would dearly
like to promote this area as a retirement haven,'' Powell said,
``but, frankly, I liked it better when there was nothing here but
little ol' beach cottages and laid-back, barefoot bars.''
   Vance Jannings, who drove down to Gulf Shores with a bunch of
buddies from the Mobile area, said no matter what it's called, the
beach is still the best party spot he knows of.
   ``We come down here every chance we get,'' said Jannings, who
was drinking beer beside the beach in a black pickup truck.
   Just then, a couple of young, bikini-clad women drove past in a
dune buggy, setting off a chorus of ``YA-HOOS'' from Jannings and
his crew. ``EEH-HA,'' replied the women, and the pickup roared off
down highway in hot pursuit, doing what comes naturally on the
Redneck Riviera.

   Violence and intimidation, traditional
sources of power behind bars, have declined in a maximum-security
prison here since officials began using a simple kind of leverage
long known to parents of unruly children: threatening to turn off
the TV.
   Drug use, too, has lessened among the 800 inmates at Wende
Correctional Facility.
   ``It's become a very effective sanction,'' said prison director
Dominic Mantello. ``All we have to do is threaten to take it away.''
   Two years ago, the Wende inmates voted unanimously to give up
their right to receive packages from the outside in exchange for
the option to buy personal television sets for their cells.
   The program was originally designed to stop most drugs coming
into the prison, but authorities quickly noticed another benefit.
   ``They know if they act up, they'll lose their TV privileges,''
said Robert McClellen, deputy superintendent for security at Wende.
``Now they walk away from most fights and turn their backs on
trouble.''
   Most state and federal prisons along with local jails have
television sets inmates can watch in groups during recreational
periods. Some allow inmates to have personal televisions, but very
few have programs like Wende's, according to George Kamp, president
of Criminal Justice Institute, a New York-based corrections
consulting firm.
   In the beginning, Mantello said he was suspicious of the idea,
thinking it would be viewed from the outside as ``coddling''
criminals.
   ``Let's face it, these people were sent here to be punished,''
he said.
   What convinced Mantello was the improvement in security at the
prison.
   Instead of gathering in unmanagable groups at recreation time,
inmates stay in their cells, which is the safest place for them and
their guards, he said.
   ``I feel safer here than walking the streets in some parts of
Buffalo,'' Mantello said. The prison is about 30 miles west of
Buffalo in the farming town of Alden.
   As Mantello walks through the cell blocks, inmates nod and greet
him with ``Hello, sir.''
   ``This is unlike any other max joint,'' said an inmate who
serves on the Inmate Liaison Committee. ``You can walk around
without worrying about taking one in the back.
   ``I know guys who transferred here who give a massive sigh of
relief,'' said the inmate, who asked not to be identified because
he didn't want to ``advertise the fact'' that he was behind bars
again.
   The program was the result of a meeting between state
Corrections Commissioner Thomas Coughlin and the members of the
inmate committee.
   The inmates had suggested the idea, arguing that personal
televisions would put an end to the sometimes violent arguments
that arise when groups of inmates try to decide what program to
watch.
   Coughlin agreed, but set two requirements. First, he wanted the
inmates to limit their right to receive packages.
   Packages sent to inmates from family and friends were a major
source of contraband. Although packages are searched, officials
said some drugs and weapons get through because of ingenious
methods of concealment and because so many packages are sent,
particularly at holidays.
   Coughlin's second requirement was that prisoners adopt the swap
unanimously.
   Coughlin put the same proposition to inmates in the state's 11
other maximum-security prisons, but only Wende approved.
   More than 400 inmates have paid $55 for 12-inch, black-and-white
sets with headphones from the prison commissary.
   Inmates earn the money working in the prison. Top scale is about
$1.50 per day.
   ``I'm not naive enough to think there's no drugs,'' Mantello
said. ``But the inmates and staff are comfortable with each other.
I don't have inmates ripping each other off for drugs. I have a
safer environment.''
   An average 58 inmates per 1,000 at the other maximum-security
prisons are found in possession of drugs, state figures show. The
rate is roughly half that at Wende: 30 per 1,000.
   Last year, 23,000 inmates at 43 state prisons facilities
underwent random urinalysis testing. Six percent tested positive
statewide; only 2 percent tested positive at Wende.
   ``It's totally different from any other facility,'' said Deputy
Superintendent McClellen, who formerly worked at the nearby Attica
Correctional Facility, the site of the 1971 riot that killed 43
people.
   McClellen said the biggest complaint from the Wende inmates was
getting too few channels.
   The inmates can generally get six channels from Buffalo and
Rochester stations, via an antenna on the roof of the prison.
However, reception is not clear in some parts of the building, and
officials are exploring other options. Mantello said a cable hookup
would be too expensive.
   ``We are not in the business of trying to please them,'' he
said, ``but we must be doing something right if that's their
biggest complaint.''

   The economists performed as expected when the
stock market crashed in October, sagely warning that a consumer-led
recession would follow. It didn't.
   Recognizing that their script might be wrong, the economists
changed it a couple of months later. They delayed their projected
recession to mid-1988, and some, daringly, even to late 1988.
   The consensus became even more widely split, however, when some
continued to talk of imminent recession. They would not be put off,
any more than the recession would be put off. But the old rationale
wouldn't work anymore.
   Recognizing that the consumer hadn't been frightened from the
marketplace, the newly adopted reasoning was that an accumulation
of inventories _ unsold goods _ would stagnate the economy and
pitch it forward on its face.
   The inventory-led recession didn't happen either, but this did
not faze the pessimists. They found a new approach: Instead of
going directly into recession, they said, the economy would first
overheat.
   That is, there would be a boom of sorts before the recession. To
most people a boom is the opposite of a bust, which is a recession,
but somehow the economic seers accomplished the turnabout without
any public apology.
   ``They are a creative bunch,'' says one economist, Edward
Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities. He thinks they have done it
again; he believes they are reacting to the past and present rather
than reading the future.
   ``It is ironic,'' he said last week, ``that the pessimistic
crowd sees a boom just as bloated inventories are starting to cool
things off.'' He thinks many of his colleagues will be forced to
flip-flop again.
   While you might marvel at this agility, its consequences cannot
be laughed off.
   Explaining why he wrote the book ``Economists At Bay, Why the
Experts Will Never Solve Your Problems,'' Robert Lekachman
explained that ``when respectable economists are wrong en masse,
other people usually suffer the consequences.''
   Lekachman wrote his book in the 1970s after watching his
colleagues provide the White House with such poor advice that the
consequences are felt to this day.
   Example: In early 1973 economists encouraged President Nixon to
dismantle a comparatively effective set of wage and price controls.
As a group, they failed to see the price explosion that followed.
   ``At no point were the economists either prescient or helpful,''
wrote Lekachman.
   When Gerald Ford succeeded Nixon, he summoned economists to a
conference in September 1974. ``None of those assembled warned of
the collapse of production and employment which began almost as
soon as they left town.''
   The advice caused Ford to launch a program aimed at beating
inflation instead of spurring the economy. Recession was the
problem; the president was advised to fight its opposite, a boom.
   Lekachman asserted that conventional economics would continue to
mislead politicians and the public until economists surrendered the
delusion that they are pure scientists.
   Have they? Will they? Any answers are as debatable as economics
itself. But some recent evidence suggests that if economics is a
science it is very inexact.
   Example: An economist who views with curiousity and perhaps
astonishment the herd mentality of colleagues to forecast an overly
strong economy based on the latest monthly employment and jobless
statistics.
   Says Albert H. Cox, Jr.: ``Employment is not a leading
indicator. It is a coincident indicator. As such, it tell us only
where we have been _ not where we're going.''
   Example: A policy paper from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
stating that the latest consumer price statistics, on which hinge
many of the latest forecasts of rising inflation, are being misread.
   It refers to the widespread assumption that inflation is
worsening, based on a sharp increase during one month, March.
   What should be noted instead, the Chamber contends, is that in
the January-March quarter the inflation rate fell. In the Chamber's
view, the threat of inflation, on which policy is being based, is
overstated.
   Could it mean another flip-flop? It certainly could.

   Heartache ungrieved has gnawed at Charlotte
Mitnik for 36 years. Her brother is among the legion of the lost,
one of 8,177 American soldiers unaccounted for in the Korean War.
   ``It's unfinished business,'' said Mrs. Mitnik, 54, of
Huntingdon Valley, Pa. Her brother, Maj. Samuel Busch, vanished
Friday, June 13, 1952, on a weather reconnaissance flight.
   ``I just want the truth. I want the end of the story,'' she
said. ``If he were dead and we had the remains, he would be home.
He would have his resting place. For now, the pain is always
there.''
   These days, few people dredge up the agony of Korea because the
memory of MIAs in Vietnam is fresher.
   Yet a comparison of casualties is heartbreakingly revealing: in
Korea, 54,246 Americans died in three years fighting an undeclared
war involving 16 United Nations countries against North Korea and
China, and more than 8,000 men were missing or taken prisoner; in
Vietnam, where U.S. involvement spanned 16 years, 58,156 soldiers
were killed and 2,204 remain unaccounted for.
   Since the end of hostilities, the remains of 179 soldiers have
been returned from Southeast Asia; none have been returned from
Korea since 1954.
   A breakthrough in Korea is sought this year, the 35th
anniversary of the armistice, because the South is host of the
Summer Olympic Games, which will focus international attention on
the peninsula and its people. North Korea has demanded a role as
co-host and threatens to otherwise keep its team away from the
games, in which 13,000 athletes from 161 nations will compete where
battles once raged.
   The war is technically still on, although a 1953 ceasefire
stopped the fighting. The opposing sides meet each year through the
Military Armistice Commission at Panmunjom to enforce the armistice
and discuss such issues as MIAs.
   Of the 8,177 MIAs in Korea, the Pentagon still lists 389 as
prisoners of war _ soldiers known to be in communist prison camps
at the ceasefire but who were not repatriated. All were eventually
presumed dead to settle insurance and death benefits.
   Bodies are supposed to be returned if they are found. Each year,
the United States has asked in vain for its MIAs and POWs. North
Korea always insisted it had no bodies _ until last year.
   On Nov. 25, the North said it had the bodies of Jack J. Saunders
of Cedar City, Utah, and Arthur L. Seaton of Philadelphia. But
international terrorism cruelly blocked their return.
   Two days after the MIA announcement, Korean Air Lines Flight 858
disappeared over the Andaman Sea near Burma with 115 people aboard.
A North Korean woman confessed she'd planted a bomb on orders from
a North Korean official to scare countries away from the Olympics.
   The United States put North Korea on its list of countries that
support terrorism and banned North Koreans from the country. The
North retaliated by refusing to turn over the bodies.
   ``North Korea slammed the door in our face. They shot us down,''
said U.S. Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., who went to Korea in hopes of
bringing the bodies home in January. ``Until they see political
advantage in turning over remains, they're not going to.''
   Rowland, 30, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and
the Veterans Committee, also rapped the government's overall
handling of MIAs in Korea.
   ``We left them there to rot,'' Rowland said.
   Government officials bristle at such criticism. The return of
MIAs was discussed 77 times from 1955 to 1957 at the Geneva
Conference, the Defense Department said, and is brought up every
year at Panmunjom.
   In 1986, the United States gave North Korea a fat file of maps
and charts on 13 former POW camps, one former POW hospital known to
have burial sites, 291 crash sites known to involve 301 people and
seven U.N. burial sites containing the remains of 288 allied
servicemen.
   Last July, the United States offered to send a multi-national
search team into the North to find bodies.
   ``Every approach has either been rebuffed or accepted without
response. It's been a one-way street,'' said Lt. Col. Keith
Schneider, spokesman for the Defense Department.
   ``It's extremely frustrating, totally bewildering and totally
inhumane to acknowledge you have them, acknowledge the
responsibility to return them and then do nothing,'' Schneider said
of the refusal to turn over the bodies.
   On the possibility of living POWs, Schneider said, ``We have no
reason to believe there are Americans still alive and being held.''
   Muddling the Korean issue is how the countries deal with each
other. North Korea, one of the world's most closed societies, wants
to deal directly with the United States rather than go through the
MAC.
   But the United States, which hasn't had relations with the North
since 1948, insists that the Soviet Union and China first recognize
South Korea.
   ``We have a nervous ally in South Korea,'' said a Korean expert
with the State Department who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``The last thing they need is for us to get into bed with their
mortal enemy. Disrupting a major alliance is too steep a price to
pay simply to get some remains.''
   But the missing men are more than ``some remains'' to Korean
veterans.
   ``I couldn't believe our government had forsaken all these
people _ it's a national disgrace,'' said Frank Kerr, a former
combat Marine and president of the Chosin Few, an organization of
3,200 Korean War veterans who fought in the epic battle of Chosin
Reservoir.
   ``They truly are the forgotten people of a forgotten war,'' said
Thomas Gregory, who heads the group's efforts to reclaim bodies.
``They were shoved aside because we had other priorities. Nobody
cared about the MIAs. It's a shame we have let it linger on.''
   North Korea has discussed MIAs with members of the Chosin Few
nine times since 1985 through its mission in New York City, the
last time on Nov. 11, 1987, when caskets and transport for the two
bodies were discussed.
   ``We were on the verge of a breakthrough,'' Kerr said.
   The North talked to the veterans' group even though it lacks
political relations with the United States.
   ``We are very much willing to solve the question on a
humanitarian basis. The U.S. government is not willing to
cooperate. They are blocking our efforts,'' said Pak Gil Yon,
United Nations observer for North Korea.
   For Catherine Kirkland, finding her brother is more important
than the intracacies of global diplomacy. She has a headstone and
gravesite in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., for her brother, Phillip
Hammond, who disappeared in the Chosin battle Dec. 6, 1950.
   ``He's an American. He belongs here. He fought for his country.
He should have the privilege of being brought home,'' Mrs. Kirkland
said in a telephone interview, sobbing anew.
   Billi Zippwold, 39, of Santa Ana, Calif., clings to memories of
her father through grainy home movies, old flight logs, service
medals and a marker at Arlington National Cemetery. His jet
disappeared Nov. 30, 1950, at the Chosin Reservoir.
   ``I'll probably spend the rest of my life wondering,'' Mrs.
Zippwold said. ``I want him home. If he's dead, I want to give him
the burial he deserves. I'd like to put an end to it so there's no
more haunting about what happened.''

   Robert Dumas is an unlikely Rambo. A
tenacious, raw-boned Connecticut Yankee, he has single-handedly
crusaded for 37 years to free a brother he thinks is still captive
in North Korea.
   ``I will not stop until I bring him home or I find out what
happened to him,'' said Dumas, 58. ``I never accepted he was dead.
I have a will that won't be broken. If I was in his shoes, wouldn't
I want my country to come get me?''
   Roger Dumas, an Army machine gunner, is one of 389 American
soldiers still listed as POWs among the 8,177 missing in action in
Korea. The Pentagon and North Korea deny any are alive, but that
hasn't stopped his brother.
   Dumas vanished in battle Nov. 4, 1950, and was listed as an MIA
that Nov. 29. He was presumed dead Feb. 26, 1954, but never
accounted for.
   Robert joined the Army and went to Korea in 1951 in a vain
search for his younger brother. A buddy mailed his letters home
from Austria so his mother wouldn't worry about losing another son.
   Through the years, Mrs. Dumas clung to the hope the youngest of
her seven children had not been killed, and she said on her
deathbed in 1959: ``He's alive.'' Robert Dumas vowed he'd find him.
   Rambo is a musclebound piece of Hollywood hokum who storms into
Vietnam to free American prisoners of war. Dumas' private war is
more subdued but no less valorous.
   In his quixotic search, Dumas, a retired state employee on a
disability pension since 1973, has mortgaged his house three times,
taken one vacation in 31 years and filled his basement to the
ceiling with papers, files, casette tapes and dog-eared documents.
   ``I can't let go of it,'' Dumas said. ``Everywhere I go, I'm
reminded of it. How can that many guys disappear in an area the
size of Rhode Island and Connecticut?''
   Dumas won a federal court trial in 1984 to force the Army to
reclassify his brother from MIA to POW. His brother is still
presumed dead, however.
   Dumas produced three witnesses who said they had seen his
brother in North Korea's Camp 5 before they were freed in 1953.
   The change in status may seem bureaucratic, but Dumas hailed it
as a breakthrough.
   ``The Army now admits he's a POW. If he's a POW, then where is
he? They have to go get him,'' Dumas said.
   What he has left of Roger are black and white photos, service
medals and childhood memories of making sure his kid brother made
the 8:30 p.m. household curfew.
   Some of Dumas' hope hinges on faint evidence and vague sightings.
   Walter Embom of Seattle, Wash., phoned Dumas in 1979 to say he'd
been a POW in Camp 5. Embom also said he was recaptured in 1956
while on patrol of the demilitarized zone. In his second captivity,
Embom said he had seen Roger Dumas and 39 other Americans.
   But the government challenged Embom's credibility, saying he was
never a prisoner, either in the war or in 1956.
   Morning roll call reports show him present daily through his
11-month tour of duty in South Korea, according to a 1980
memorandum from the House Armed Services Investigation Subcommittee.
   ``All of the information supplied by Embom must be rejected as
it has no basis in fact,'' according to the panel's staff
memorandum.
   Serban Oprica, a Romanian businessman who now lives in
Bloomfield, Conn., told Dumas he saw 50 Americans working in a
cabbage field in North Korea in 1980, giving Dumas hope his brother
might still be one of them.
   ``If I die and nothing happens, at least I tried,'' Dumas said.
``This is all I ever focused on. I am a driven man.''

<HEAD>The Most Common Myths About College Tuition</HEAD>

   The average cost of attending private
universities is up 81 percent, to $11,870 a year, from 1980. For
public universities, the total of tuition, fees, room and board has
increased 61 percent, to about $4,370. The cost at some selective
private schools this fall will approach $20,000.
   Such numbers are painfully clear this spring to prospective
freshmen and their parents who, fresh from the euphoria of mailed
acceptances, now face the hard part: how to pay.
   Help exists for most families. A federal study this month found
that 58 percent of full-time undergraduates receive financial aid
from federal and state government or from colleges themselves. Aid
per student averages $3,813.
   But college aid officials report widespread confusion about who
is eligible for such aid. Familiar rules about tuition and how to
pay it have given way to myths and misconceptions. Here are some of
the most common, with comments to help set the record straight:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Myth 1: ``It doesn't pay to save for college. If you do, the
school just takes your savings. If you don't, the college will
rescue you with financial aid.''
   ``That's just a screwy way to plan for the future,'' said
Kathleen Brouder, director of information of the College
Scholarship Service of the College Board.
   Brouder and other college officials say the myth shows a
misunderstanding of the congressionally mandated formula colleges
use to estimate how much aid a student can expect. Contrary to what
many families believe, the formula weighs income more heavily than
assets and savings in calculating a family's expected contribution.
   To illustrate: parents with two children, a $40,000 annual
income and $20,000 in assets would ordinarily be expected to
contribute $4,616 per year. If that family had $20,000 more in
savings, their expected contribution would increase only slightly,
to $4,864. But if their annual income went up the same $20,000,
their expected contribution would more than double, to $10,384.
   In a different respect, however, the myth contains a germ of
truth.
   Families who put aside assets in their childrens' names may gain
tax advantages but miss out on grants and loans. This is because
the aid formula entitles colleges to count 35 percent of such
custodial accounts as part of the family's annual contribution.
Combined with parental payments, a family's contribution could be
too high to qualify for aid.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Myth 2: ``The higher the tuition, the better the school.''
   Educators have lately dubbed this the ``Chivas Regal''
mentality. It holds that schools that charge the most educate the
best, and those with lower tuitions must be inferior.
   As any guidance counselor knows, scores of schools among the
more than 3,000 U.S. institutions of higher learning charge
relatively low tuitions but provide top educations. Alongside the
many state universities that fill that description are such private
schools as Albion College in Michigan, Millsaps College in
Mississippi, Loras College in Iowa and Centre College in Kentucky.
   Nevertheless, the most expensive schools continue to attract the
most applicants. Harvard, for example, this year received 14,430
applications for 2,147 freshman places.
   Some colleges, Mt. Holyoke for example, openly admit they won't
drop tuitions much below their competitors because they fear
applicants will think their quality is slipping.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Myth 3: ``Federal student aid has plunged in the Reagan years.''
   True, government aid is down. In 1987, aid from government and
private sources totaled $20.5 billion, up 21 percent from 1980, but
down 6 percent when adjusted for inflation.
   And new rules have made it harder to qualify, with candidates
required to demonstrate financial need.
   But the biggest change in the financial aid picture occurred
before Reagan was elected. Starting in the mid-1970s, the
proportion of all student aid in the form of loans grew from
one-fifth to one-half. That has meant students and parents are
assuming more college debts than ever.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Myth 4: ``I can't afford the most selective schools.''
   Perhaps no one hears this more often than Joan Goodrich,
financial aid director of Bennington College in Vermont, where
annual costs in September will reach $19,990, the nation's highest.
   More than half of Bennington's students receive college grants,
averaging $9,000 per student. Combined with work-study aid and
government loans, Goodrich said, the grants make that $20,000 bill
closer to $9,000.
   That's small comfort to many middle-class students, for whom
$9,000 is still a hefty, even prohibitive sum. But for poorer
students, colleges who want diverse student bodies will pick up
most of the tab. It is thus conceivable that a Bennington could
wind up no more expensive than a state college if a student can
prove need.
   Furthermore, well-endowed colleges tend to use the financial aid
formula as the starting point for calculating a family's need. Aid
officers exercise professional discretion in judging what each
family can afford.

don't qualify.''
   This encompasses a whole family of myths, each reflecting
misunderstanding of how much help the poor, the middle class and
the wealthy believe is available.
   Middle-class parents commonly complain, ``Poor kids always get
taken care of.''
   Not always. There's no question that the lower a family's
income, the less it is expected to contribute. According to the
formula, a family of four with a $20,000 income would be expected
to contribute $398 a year, while the figure for a family with a
$40,000 income would be $4,616.
   Still, middle-class families enjoy many more options than most
poor families. While the poor student with extraordinary athletic
or academic ability might win a scholarship to a school with a
hefty endowment, the one with more average talents finds precious
few schools willing to absorb enough of the tuition to make
attendance affordable.
   Conversely, aid officers meet many families these days who
wrongly believe ``we're too rich to apply.''
   ``We have a family of four with an income of $70,000 with two
kids in college,'' said Alicia Reyes, director of college aid at
the University of Chicago, which will charge an estimated $19,000
for tuition, fees, room and board next fall.
   ``For their kid attending our school, the parental contribution
will be $7,000,'' she said.

   Myth 6: ``You can work your way through school.''
   ``I have a lot of parents who come to me, and say, `I worked my
way through and that is what my kid should do,''' said Barbara
Lutz, director of student employment at the University of Texas at
Arlington.
   At the low wages most students can expect between classes or
during summers off, it's absurd for parents to imagine their
children can contribute more than a fraction of college costs.
   Federally subsidized work programs make up just 3.7 percent of
total college aid, down from a little over 5 percent in 1970-71. A
student in the program who works the average 12 hours a week at
minimum wage might earn 6 percent of an annual college bill.
   That doesn't mean a job is a bad idea. A 1987 study released by
the Higher Education Coordinating Board in Olympia, Wash., examined
3,600 student records and found that those who worked outperformed
those who didn't: Undergraduates who worked 10-20 hours a week got
better grades than those who worked fewer than 10 hours or more
than 20 hours.

<HEAD>Influential California Lures Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lured by the warm promise of California, the
three remaining presidential candidates are being drawn into a
month-long primary campaign that is as much a preview of the fall
campaign as a final nomination battleground.
   Jesse Jackson, trailing for the Democratic nomination, and
Michael Dukakis, the front-runner, have already made initial forays
into the state, as has George Bush, whose Republican nomination is
assured.
   Each has a little different goal in mind in the state that has
been reliably Republican in 20 years of presidential elections, but
may not be so this year.
   ``Jesse's going to be looking toward June 7, but Dukakis and
Bush are going to be taking this time now to work toward
November,'' said Steven Teichner, a polltaker based in Orange
County, Calif.
   For Jackson, California offers the last chance to score an upset
over Dukakis, an outcome that would strengthen Jackson's influence
at the Democratic National Convention but likely would not be
enough to derail the Massachusetts governor's drive to the
nomination.
   The challenge for Dukakis is to avoid the pitfalls of
California's contrary nature _ the state has rejected the eventual
Democratic nominee in the last three primary elections _ and at the
same time to lay the groundwork for the fall campaign in a state
that may be crucial in putting together an electoral majority.
   And for Bush, the job is to keep the Democrats from grabbing all
the attention, to generate some excitement for himself and to
attempt to close the gap in polls that show him trailing Dukakis by
10 percentage points among California voters.
   Jackson has promised to spend more than three full weeks
campaigning for California's 314 Democratic delegates. Dukakis
plans to spend 10 days to two weeks, spread over several weeks.
Bush aides expect him to log a minimum of eight or nine days here,
even though he has no real competition and the nomination in his
pocket.
   It will mean more candidate attention than California has been
accustomed to seeing, given a primary date that falls too late to
have a real role in deciding the nominee in most recent years,
Teichner said.
   ``We've never had candidates spend as much time as these guys
are going to spend here,'' said Teichner. ``Dukakis and Bush are
going to campaign here as if it were October.
   ``What you will learn on June 7 is what message works for
November,'' he said.
   Campaigning in Southern California last week, Jackson was doing
his best to dispel the notion that the Democratic race is already
decided. He asserted that despite the long lead in delegates that
Dukakis enjoys, California could turn the race around for him.
   ``California has the power to determine the next nominee of our
party,'' Jackson said.
   A poll this month by Teichner for the San Francisco Examiner and
KRON-TV showed Dukakis leading Jackson 49 percent to 28 percent.
Teichner said softness in Dukakis's support, as in other states,
suggested his lead ``is premised more on inevitability than an
affinity for Michael Dukakis.''
   Jackson won 21 percent of the vote in California in 1984, when
Gary Hart finished ahead of eventual nominee Walter Mondale.
   His campaign has said it hopes to outspend Dukakis here, and
while most observers expect him to better his showing of four years
ago, his appeal to environmentalists, blacks, Hispanics, gays and
young liberals suggests only limited potential _ unless Dukakis'
voters do not turn out. The Spanish-speaking Dukakis also has
appeal to Hispanics, as he demonstrated in winning Texas.
   Former Democratic national chairman Charles Mannatt, a Los
Angeles lawyer, says he expects Jackson to score in the ``high
30s.''
   San Francisco polltaker Mervin Field said, ``I haven't seen the
kind of elements that would auger a Jackson victory.''
   ``Right now I don't see him doing much better than 10 or 12
points better than he did four years ago,'' Field said. ``Thirty or
35 percent in a three-way race looks fairly impressive, but in a
two-way race, if the winner gets 60 or 65 percent, it doesn't look
so good.''
   Dukakis, ever cautious, is careful not to look beyond
California. But even so, Dukakis and Bush have begun focusing on
each other in campaign rhetoric, and can be expected to do so
before California's voters.
   ``We are working hard in California,'' said Dukakis campaign
manager Susan Estrich. ``As much as we can do there now is also an
investment for the fall.''
   Bush campaign press secretary Pete Teeley said California's 47
electoral votes are ``extraordinarily important to the November
outcome,'' and dismissed the suggestion that Bush's campaign
schedule is mimicking the travels of the Democrats.
   ``We have to get out there and begin to build a base of
support,'' Teeley said. ``... We have to go where we have to go. If
they're in the state, they're in the state. We can't ignore the
West.''
   The Republicans have carried California in every presidential
election since losing it in 1964, aided in most of those years by
the presence of a Californian on the ticket. This year Gov. George
Deukmejian is mentioned often as a running mate for Bush, although
it would mean turning over the California governor's office to the
Democrats.
   The size of California makes it important in any electoral
strategy. A candidate who carried California would have the same
electoral clout as an opponent who won a dozen smaller states.
   For the Democrats, California may loom even more important.
Although Democrats say there's no state-by-state electoral strategy
in mind yet, Bush's roots in Texas give him an edge there, and the
loss of Texas and California, two electoral giants, would make it
extremely difficult for a Democrat to win the White House.
   ``California does occupy a pivotal position in most general
election scenarios,'' said Paul Jensen, Dukakis' political director.
   ``The worst thing that could happen to us, obviously, is to have
our momentum broken by a strong Jackson showing in California,'' he
said. But, he added, it is also important to show Dukakis can be
competitive in the state for the fall.
   ``I'd like to demonstrate the ability of Michael Dukakis to
attract broad-based support in an important, diverse state,'' said
Richard Yberra, Dukakis' Western coordinator who is running the
California campaign, ``because California has so much in common
with the other regions of the country.''

<HEAD>Charlotte Fedders: `They Say I've Done Just What I Had to Do'
^An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POTOMAC, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charlotte Fedders ushers a guest from the
cluttered kitchen of her suburban Washington home to the sunny
living room filled with photographs of her children.
   A cat snuggling on the couch is quickly shooed away and Mrs.
Fedders begins to describe in even tones the physical and mental
abuse inflicted by her husband, the former top chief of enforcement
at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   She speaks about the violence during her 18-year marriage, the
legal battles with her ex-husband John Fedders, the resiliency of
her five sons and her own inner strength. She pauses to deal with a
question from son Peter, who has padded downstairs in bare feet to
ask, ``Do elephants have tails?''
   Five years ago, a messy kitchen, cat hairs in the living room
and a sudden display of precociousness would have been verboten. In
her book, ``Shattered Dreams,'' Charlotte Fedders described her
husband's weekly white-glove inspections, in which he ran his
fingers along tops of doors and windows, and how he liked to see
the vacuum marks in the carpet all going the same way.
   As the result of her experience, Charlotte Fedders has become
one of the nation's best-known victims of spouse abuse. She speaks
out on the issue around the country and in return receiving
thousands of letters filled with words of encouragement and
personal tales of domestic violence.
   ``I have folders of letters that I can't respond to,'' she says.
``They pour their hearts out to me. There's enormous support.
   ``They say I've done just what I had to do. I had no other
choice.''
   At one time, the Fedders family gave the appearance of an ideal
existence _ wealthy suburban home, exclusive country club
membership, private schools, powerful Washington job.
   But a dirty secret festered inside the six-bedroom, beige brick
house in Potomac, Md.: John Fedders beat his wife.
   ``We had been talking for a while. All I remember is that this
conversation seemed to be going well. That we were really
conversing, sharing ideas. We were not fighting, we were not being
sarcastic or nasty. I swear we were just talking,'' Charlotte
Fedders wrote in her book, referring to the first time her husband
struck her in 1968.
   ``But I think it was the first time I disagreed with him and was
sticking to my guns. I was arguing my point calmly, but I was
holding to it. ... It was one good sock to the left side of my ear.
Then I heard this ringing sound. I found out later that he had
broken my eardrum.''
   In court testimony during the February 1985 divorce trial,
Charlotte Fedders described seven violent incidents that occurred
during her marriage, including the time her husband struck her
while she was four months pregnant with their first child.
   ``He loomed over me and hit me in the abdomen, three, maybe five
times, hard. I bent over, trying to protect my tummy. They were
powerful blows. It felt like taking a heavy fall. ... I tried to
push him away, which only seemd to make him madder. He yelled that
he didn't care if he killed me or the baby,'' she wrote in her book.
   Among those present in the courtroom during the divorce
proceedings was a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, whose
article of Feb. 25 on John Fedders' problems touched off a furor
that forced Fedders to resign his SEC post late the next day.
   In his resignation letter to then SEC Chairman John Shad,
Fedders said, ``On seven occasions during more than 18 years of
marriage, marital disputes between us resulted in violence for
which I feel and have expressed great remorse.''
   ``These isolated events do not, however, justify the extreme
characterizations made in the press,'' he said.
   Fedders did not respond to several telephone calls seeking his
comments on his former wife's charges.
   The ideal family was no more, but the legal battles continued.
After John Fedders testified, he pleaded with the court to give him
time to work out a reconciliation with his wife. Montgomery County
Circuit Court Judge James S. McAuliffe suggested that the couple go
out to dinner and try to talk things out.
   ``That was a devastating moment,'' Charlotte Fedders said in a
recent interview, recalling the 5-year-old incident. ``He thought
it was the right thing for the kids-slash-me. John had promised
never to do it again. The judge showed a total lack of
understanding of domestic violence.''
   In 1987, a Circuit Court domestics relations official, John S.
McInerney, reduced John Fedders' alimony payments from $750 a month
to $500. McInerney also awarded Fedders a 25 percent share of the
proceeds from his wife's book, saying she shared the blame for his
violent outbursts because she withheld emotional support during his
depression.
   ``He obviously ruled very poorly. ... He doesn't know what's
going on,'' she said.
   Judge McAuliffe in February of this year reversed McInerney's
action, ruling that Fedders could not share in the profits from his
wife's book, but his decision was based on the belief that no exact
monetary value can be placed on a book. McAuliffe said it cannot be
considered a marital asset.
   The judge also reduced John Fedders' alimony payments to $400 a
month. Fedders had asked the court to end the payments, saying the
publicity had hurt his earning capacity by damaging his once
successful legal career.
   ``This particular judge made the final ruling and I did as well
as I could do,'' Charlotte Fedders said. ``He didn't understand
that John was manipulating the system, manipulating lives.
   ``There isn't a soul who doesn't think John Fedders couldn't be
doing well _ in a small way John won. The judge bought John's
truth.''
   For Charlotte Fedders, the product of a strict Roman Catholic
education and a family dominated by a strong father, her lone
desire was the realization of an old-fashioned dream.
   ``All I ever wanted to be was a wife and mother,'' she wrote in
her book. ``To marry a man who could give me children and a
comfortable life, filled with love and little strife. ... So
finding that man was very important.''

   While working at Washington's Providence Hospital during her
senior year of college, Charlotte O'Donnell met John Fedders, then
a second-year law student at Catholic University.
   He was the man she imagined _ tall (6-foot-10), handsome, a
Catholic who wanted a family. They married, moved from New York to
Texas to Washington, as John succeeded in his law career, and had
six boys, one of whom, John Michael, died of spinal meningitis.
   During their marriage, according to Charlotte's book, the couple
lived beyond their means, taking out loans to buy furniture and
homes in wealthy neighborhoods.
   The physical abuse, which began in 1968, occasionally stopped
when work went well for John Fedders. There was one three-year
break from violence. But when the demands of the SEC job and the
family's financial problems got to John, the beatings resumed.
   There were also incidents of black moods, depression and long
silences, Charlotte Fedders says.
   ``I ... used to hide in the closet. ... It was terrible, a human
being huddled in a closet like a prisoner of war. I wasn't hiding
from him because he was yelling at me, or because he had threatened
me. I'd usually hide when he wasn't responding at all. Looking at
me with hate or looking straight through me, saying nothing. I just
couldn't stand the emotional rejection anymore,'' she wrote.
   On a number of occasions, Charlotte Fedders took steps to end
the marriage, finally contacting a lawyer in February 1983. John
Fedders moved out of the house on July 2.
   Asked why she had finally pushed herself to end the marriage
after years of abuse, she talks about her own self-esteem, her
ability to survive and support a family and the impact on her sons.
   ``The prime reason was the effect it was having on the
children,'' she said. ``It took me close to a year. It was obvious
what was being directed at the children. I might not deserve more
but they deserve more.''
   Since Charlotte Fedders took that step, she has written a
lengthy magazine article and collaborated on the book with Laura
Elliot, a senior writer at Washingtonian magazine, to defray the
legal costs. Her older boys are working to pay for their education.
   The Potomac house is up for sale and the family plans to move to
another Washington suburb, Gaithersburg, after a trip to Disneyland
this summer.
   ``I still don't know if we're finally going to make it,'' she
said. ``But I'm really happy about things, content, hopeful, upbeat
about the future.''

<HEAD>Michael Dukakis Draws In Audience With Kennedy Memories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a recent speech by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in his campaign for the 1988
Democratic nomination for president:
   
   Three decades ago, the Soviet Union launched the first satellite
into space. It was called Sputnik; and many said that it spelled
the end of America's technological and economic leadership in the
world.
   We could have accepted that judgment. We could have sat back and
settled in and gone along as we were. Making excuses. Taking it
easy. Living in the past.
   Instead, we elected a new president. John Kennedy awakened our
sense of possibility. He rekindled our idealism. He gave us
confidence. And he raised the stars and stripes so high they
literally reached the moon.
   And when John Kennedy accepted the Democratic nomination in
1960, he said that ``today, our concern must be with the future.
For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways will
not do.''
   Today, as in 1960, we're in a battle for the economic future of
America. And now, as then, the old ways simply will not do.
   This fall, the Republican Party is going to be asking Americans
to keep things as they are. But I say we have to change. And I say
we must change. I say we must make change work for us, not against
us.
   Because during the past seven years, I've seen too many people
thrown out into the streets after decades on the job.
   I've listened to too many people who work hard from dawn to
midnight every day and still can't pay their bills.
   I've talked to too many students who have the skills and the
energy and the ambition to go to college but not the money.
   I've read too many stories about how America is supposed to be
in decline; about how our children will have to settle for a
second-rate economy and a second-class future.
   I don't buy that.
   We Americans aren't about to write off a whole generation of
young people.
   We're not about to accept an America where all we do is flip
each other's hamburgers and take in each other's laundry for $3.35
an hour.
   We're not about to sit on the sidelines while our neighbors are
thrown out of work and America's home towns are boarded up and left
to die.
   As a New Englander, I've seen what happens when good, decent,
hard-working people lose their jobs. I've seen what happens to
their families and to their communities. I saw it in Lowell and
Haverhill, Mass., when the textile mills and shoe factories my
parents had worked in when they first came to this country pulled
up stakes and headed south. I saw it when carpenters and
bricklayers and ironworkers had to leave their homes and families
and travel hundreds of miles to find construction work in other
states.
   Over the past decade, in communities all over Ohio and Indiana
and throughout the Midwest, we've seen the same kind of pain and
agony and uncertainty that we lived through in New England during
the '50s and '60s and early '70s.
   We see people struggling to make ends meet. We see communities
struggling to rebuild in the face of changing technology and tough
foreign competition.
   We see governors like Dick Celeste, and mayors and community
leaders throughout this region struggling to create a bright future
for their citizens.
   That's why this election is so important.

   Because our citizens and communities and state and local leaders
need a strong federal partner in the White House.
   We need a president who knows how to balance a budget and mop up
Republican red ink _ and has done it. A president who knows now to
create jobs and how to save jobs _ and has done it. A president
who's been tested in the fires of debts and deficits and hard
economic times. A president with the strength, the vision and the
values to get this nation moving again.
   And beginning in January of 1989, we're going to build a future
of hope and pride and opportunity for Ohio and for this country.
We're going to take charge of our economic future. And we're not
going to stop until America is No. 1.
   My friends, I'm a full employment Democrat and I'm proud of it.
   I'm not running for president to overthrow governments in
Central America; I want to create jobs in middle America. And I
know that if we Americans work together; if we invest together and
build together; we can turn this country around and each and every
one of us can be a part of it.
   Because if we're going to make America No. 1, the working men
and women of this country must be full partners in the battle for
our economic future.
   We need a decent minimum wage law. Sixty years ago, Franklin
Roosevelt asked for a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour; the
Republicans opposed it. Twenty-eight years ago, John Kennedy asked
for a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour; the Republicans opposed it.
Today, after the longest period in recent American history without
an increase in the minimum wage, the Republicans are still opposed
to it.
   They haven't changed. They won't change. And that's why we need
a change in Washington, D.C.
   We need basic health insurance for every family in America. I'm
proud to be the first governor in the history of this nation to
sign legislation that will guarantee health insurance for every
citizen in my state. If we can do it in one state, we ought to be
able to do it for the country.
   We're got to change the way we think about adult education and
job training in this country. Education isn't just for the young;
and job training isn't just for those on welfare or for the
unemployed. We can't afford to treat our workers like replacement
parts in some obsolete machine. Learning must be a lifelong
process; and it must be a continual, ongoing part of every job in
industrial America.
   Here in Ohio, at the Chrysler plant in Perrysburg, labor and
management have sponsored college level training programs in
computer skills and electronics and financial planning. And the
Metal Forming and Coining plant at Maumee is underwriting all the
academic courses their employees wish to take.
   That's the kind of investment and teamwork we need to build a
future where our workers are the catalysts _ not the victims _ of
change.
   We're going to help our basic industries to rebuild and retool.
Not by giving them massive tax breaks with no strings attached. We
don't need any more U.S. Steels taking federal help and then going
out and buying Marathon oil.
   Instead, we'll say to industries in trouble: ``We'll provide you
with some protection for a limited period of time, if you agree, in
advance, to use that time to invest and modernize and become more
efficient.'' And when I say ``invest,'' I don't just mean
investments in new technology and equipment; I mean investments in
your workers and in the quality of your workplace, as well.
   We need a strong plant closing law that will give our workers
the notice, the training, and the benefits they need to find new
jobs with good wages when plants shut down in this country.
   Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly to
approve national plant closing legislation.
   President Reagan has said he will veto that bill. I urge him to
sign it.
   I happen to be the governor of the only state in the country
with a comprehensive plant closing law. We passed it with the
support of labor and business. And it's working. Because we've been
able to save thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses.
   And I hope the president will take the time to think about the 3
million American workers who lose their jobs in this country every
year through plant shutdowns. In at least half those cases, those
plants shut down with little or no notice to those most affected _
their own employees.
   These people are our neighbors. They deserve better from their
employers; they deserve better from America.

<TEXT>
   The principle behind plant closing legislation is simple. If we
want to save jobs; we've got to know, in advance, that a factory or
a plant is in trouble. We've got to give governors and mayors and
community leaders a chance to go to work to save those jobs; to
keep that plant open; to cushion the blow for the community where
that plant is located.
   The national plant closing bill approved by Congress will help
us to save jobs. It will help our workers to get the skills to find
new jobs. It will help our communities by keeping plants open. It
will help our taxpayers by reducing the cost of unemployment
insurance and welfare. It should be the law of the land.
   Finally, if we're serious about winning the battle for our
economic future, we've got to get control of the merger and
acquisition binge that's gobbling up our capital, destroying
competition, and creating billions in profits for a few, without
creating a single new job for American workers.
   Today, too many of our best educated and most talented citizens
are using their skills not in America's war against foreign
competition; but in a civil war for paper profits _ a war that pits
region against region, business against business, and management
against labor; a war that weakens our economy at home and our
competitiveness abroad; a war whose primary victims are the working
men and women of America.
   During the past five years, more than 12,000 American
corporations have changed hands. Today, according to Business Week,
the corporate takeover wave is ``skyscraper high.'' We've had 15
takeover bids of a billion dollars or more since New Year's Day _
less than four months ago.
   And what have we got to show for it?
   Massive corporate debt. Lower quality products. Workers thrown
into the streets. A less competitive America.
   And the profits they're making are unbelievable. We've seen
corporate raiders make $140 million trying to take over Safeway,
while 35,000 workers were laid off.
   We've seen raiders make $160 million in a deal that forced
Goodyear so far into debt it had to shut down plants in high
unemployment areas in Maryland and Michigan. And for the people of
Akron _ the community here in Ohio which depends so heavily only
the long-term success of Goodyear _ there now is, in the words of
its congressman and former Mayor Tom Sawyer, ``a lingering sense of
insecurity not only for the future of Goodyear, but for the future
of our community.''
   Altogether, 500,000 workers have lost their jobs as a result of
the merger mania in recent years; and thousands more have had
pension plans terminated so that companies could skim the surplus
off those pension funds.
   And why are we putting up with this? Because we have a Labor
Department and an NLRB that won't stand up for the American
workers. Because we've got an attorney general who couldn't tell
the difference between antitrust and antifreeze; and a Federal
Trade Commission that seems to have forgotten that its job is to
promote and encourage competition in the American marketplace.
   Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams aren't a model for
the best America. To build the future we want, we're going to have
to do what my parents and millions of immigrants did when they came
to this country. Work hard. Save. Invest. Produce, not just
consume. Make sure that the label ``Made in America'' _ the union
label _ is a symbol of quality and durability and value all over
the world.
   My friends, America isn't just a place; it's not just another
piece of land; or just another country. It's the noblest experiment
ever undertaken on this planet. It's a symbol of what we human
beings can do _ when we work together; when we respect each other;
when we understand that we are one people. One nation. One
community.
   Because there are no shortcuts to the American dream.
   The best America doesn't hide; we compete.
   The best America doesn't waste; we invest.
   The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind; we
work for everyone.
   The best America doesn't yearn for the past; we prepare to take
on the future.
   The best America isn't behind us; the best America is yet to
come.
   The best America is a nation where the son of Greek immigrants
can seek _ and win _ the presidency of the United States.
   Thank you very much.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Recalls Civil Rights Era</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a basic stump speech by
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson:
   
   I come to you from a tradition of challenge, of struggle and of
success.
   Sunday, March 6, marked the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in
Selma, Ala. There, 23 years ago, marchers led by John Lewis and
young students tried to cross Edmund Pettus Bridge demonstrating
for the right to vote. They were beaten back, bloodied by dogs and
clubs. But they did not bow.
   Twenty years ago, a generation of young Americans stood up to
end racial violence under the law. When Rosa Parks refused to go to
the back of the bus in Montgomery, Ala., a divinity student _
Martin Luther King _ came to her rescue. When Dr. King was
arrested, other students and ministers came to his rescue.
   In Greensboro, N.C., students sat down at lunch counters. They
ordered hamburgers but were given handcuffs. They chose dignity
over docility. And young Americans stood with them.
   Twenty years ago, the moral issue of that day was racial
violence, sanctioned by the law. But when young America stood tall,
the country responded. Today we have the right to vote. We have the
right to use libraries, hotels, public accommodations. We have the
right of equal access to education. Faced with the challenge of
racial violence, we have achieved civil rights and moved toward
racial justice.
   Today, as I look out over you _ black, brown, red, yellow and
white, male and female _ I see the fruits of our labors, the
victory of young America's struggle. And I rejoice _ for we have
helped to keep America strong and to make America better.
   In this day we face a new challenge _ to end economic violence.
It is the unfinished business of the country, of two generations.
And it is more pressing than ever.
   It is the unfinished agenda of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the
generation that sacrificed so much to triumph in the Second World
War. That war was fought to secure fundamental human rights:
freedom of speech and religion, freedom from fear and want.
   We have made great strides to achieve political and religious
freedom in this country. But the promise of economic rights and
freedom from fear has remained unfulfilled.
   Twenty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King moved the country to
help fulfill the promise of civil and political rights, marching to
end racial violence.
   But Dr. King did not stop in Selma. He left us in Memphis,
Tenn., where he stood with striking garbage workers. The garbage
workers had their civil rights. They had the right to vote. But
they worked without a liveable wage. They had no right to strike.
They worked, but they worked in poverty. Dr. King stood with them
when he was taken from us.
   Twenty years later, this unfinished business is the central
moral challenge of the day.
   Plant gates that close upon workers without notice. Economic
violence. Shipyards where goods made by repressed labor abroad
undercut organized labor at home. Economic violence. Schoolyards
where students with good minds can't get a scholarship and can't
make a loan. Economic violence. Hospitals where people lie without
care in admitting offices because they don't have a yellow or green
card to go upstairs to a bed that's empty waiting for the insured
to get sick. Economic violence.
   A little known fact in America today is that most poor people
are not black or brown. Most poor people are white. Most poor
people are young. Most poor people are female. And most able-bodied
poor people are not on welfare _ they work. But when they finish
working they do not have a sufficient wage to lift their children
from poverty.
   The poor serve food to others every day. They work hard every
day. They raise other people's children, sometimes neglecting their
own. They work hard every day. They take care of the sick, in
hospitals, changing their clothes and their bed pans. They work
hard every day. And when they get sick they can't afford to stay in
the hospital that they work in. They work hard every day.
   We are a better nation than that. We need a comprehensive
national health care program for all Americans.

   To address this challenge, we must analyze the situation
correctly.
   We have lost 650,000 family farms in America over the past seven
years. Workers throughout the United States _ auto workers, steel
workers, machinists, electricians, computer programmers _ have been
displaced from jobs.
   Farmers who fed the nation and fed the world know how to farm.
Workers who have built the country know how to work. The problem is
not the farmer or the worker. They deserve our respect. The problem
is that the structure doesn't work.
   It's not a question of black people taking jobs from white
people; of women taking jobs from men.
   When a plant closes without notice, when a farm is sold at
auction, they pull out the plug. The lights go out. You can't use
color or sex for a crutch in the dark. We all look remarkably
similar in the dark.
   Now we hear a lot about foreign workers _ Taiwanese, Koreans _
taking our jobs. Many seek to blame foreigners for the loss of
jobs. But foreign workers without the right to organize and barely
the right to vote are not taking our jobs from us. U.S.
multinational corporations are taking our jobs to them.
   For example, in 1986, the United States imported 7 million
bicycles from Taiwan. There are no Taiwanese bicycle companies,
only Schwinn and other companies. As the vice president of Schwinn
stated, ``The competition from Taiwan is us.''
   In 1986, the biggest exporter from Taiwan wasn't Taiwanese. It
was General Electric, which owns RCA, which owns NBC, which
advertises buy in America on television. General Electric took jobs
to Taiwan not looking for better labor, but cheaper labor. The
American worker can compete, but first we need to level the playing
field.
   General Electric is one of the top 10 Pentagon contractors. From
1981-84, it made $10 billion in profits. It paid nothing in taxes.
In fact, it received a $100 million tax rebate. That's not fair.
   It's not a question of white against black, or Asians against
Americans, it's a question of barracudas and small fish.
   Today, some 36,000 workers at Eastern Airlines are threatened
with the loss of their jobs, unless they take 25-60 percent cuts in
pay and benefits.
   Why? Because Frank Lorenzo of Texas Air, a corporate barracuda,
bought Eastern and now is prepared to dismember the company in
order to crush the union.
   Who pays? Workers pay _ in wage cuts and lack of protection.
Passengers pay. Lorenzo's airline conglomerate in recent months has
the worst safety and service record in the industry. Communities
pay. If Eastern workers are displaced, the economy of Atlanta will
be depressed. Only the barracuda benefits.
   We must change the incentives and stop the merger of
corporations, the purging of workers and the submerging of our
economy.
   We need to level the playing field. We need to change the
incentives to get corporations to reinvest in America, to retrain
our workers, to reindustrialize our nation, to promote research and
development.
   We must join with Germany and Japan to lower interest rates and
stimulate global growth.
   We must relieve the debt which is crushing the Third World. If
their debt goes down, our trade goes up. If our trade goes up, our
deficit goes down and our economy gets moving again.
   We need to make the denial of basic labor rights an unfair trade
practice, so that workers abroad have the opportunity to gain fair
wages and working conditions.
   As their wages go up, they can afford to buy our goods, and our
trade goes up. We all rise together. Either we will work to raise
the living conditions of workers in the Third World, or we will
lower our conditions toward theirs.
   We need to challenge the very premise of Reaganomics. Bush was
right when he said this was voodoo economics. But Bush is the only
person who can't quote himself.
   Reagan assumed that the poor had too much money, the rich had
too little and that our insecurity came from a weak military. So he
engaged in a reverse Robin Hood _ he took from the poor and gave to
the rich.
   From 1977 to 1988, the bottom 10 percent ended up paying 20
percent more in taxes and the top 1 percent are paying 20 percent
less in taxes.
   Essentially he gave the rich and the powerful a $400 billion tax
cut.
   The assumption was that they would invest in America and get our
economy going again. Instead, they had a party. Merging
corporations, speculating on junk bonds, playing in the stock
market. Then on Oct. 19, the stock market crashed. Now they want
you _ who weren't even invited to the party _ to pay for the party.
That is not fair.
   Reagan assumed that we felt insecure because our military was
weak, so he doubled the military budget in peacetime.
   But he was wrong. Our military is strong _ the strongest in the
world _ it's our policy that's weak. Strong military, weak policy.
   We are militarily superior in Central America, but our policy is
weak. We are militarily superior in South Africa, but our policy is
weak.
   We have 26,000 nuclear warheads, 13,000 pointing at the
Russians. Even President Reagan has come to understand that more
nuclear weapons simply make us less secure.

<TEXT>
   We must begin to make sense.
   Last year there was a 19-day strike of Chicago school teachers.
We just couldn't find the money to pay those teachers.
   Well, at Christmas I took my children to visit the prisoners at
Cook County Jail.
   I did some research. Full year scholarship in Chicago public
schools: $3,500. Full year scholarship at Chicago State University:
$1,500. Full year scholarship at Cook County Jail: $12,000.
   Schools at their worst are better than jails at their best. I
choose to invest in prenatal care, Head Start and child care on the
front side of life rather than welfare and jailcare on the back
side. Let's make sense.
   Think about our security.
   The No. 1 threat on our streets today is not Nicaragua. We are
not threatened by 3 million Sandinistas. And 15,000 Contras could
not save us from them if we were.
   The No. 1 threat to our security today is drugs _ cocaine,
crack, heroin and PCP. Drugs are now a $150 billion tax free
industry.
   Overrunning our borders. Corrupting entire governments. Leading
cause of crime. A primary cause of AIDS. Destroying our children,
undermining workers and productivity, overwhelming police forces,
threatening to bankrupt city budgets.
   In a $150 billion industry, more than children are involved.
Bankers are involved, laundering that money. It is a factor in
foreign exchange. Governments are involved, protecting the trade.
It is an aspect of our foreign policy, either the most inept or the
most corrupt aspect of our foreign policy.
   Drugs are no longer a nuisance. Today, drugs are the No. 1
threat to our national security, to our children, to our
communities.
   I went to the Coast Guard in Florida.
   In 1986, they interdicted 10,300 pounds of cocaine. In 1987,
13,900 pounds. Then the Coast Guard budget was cut by $105 million.
   They busted the Coast Guard and gave drug traffickers a green
light. When I raised a storm about it, the White House called. We
didn't cut the Coast Guard budget. The Congress did.
   Well, he fought for Contra aid, why not fight for Coast Guard
aid? If the Congress wanted to cut the Coast Guard budget, he could
have just said no.
   Today we have troops in Korea, the Philippines, and Europe, and
that is OK. But security begins at our borders. It does not make
sense to have 325,000 troops stationed in a Europe at peace, while
we are overwhelmed at our borders by a threat to our children.
Let's make sense.
   Everyone says, yes we are for economic justice. But we have this
deficit. We're for educating our children. But we have this
deficit. We're for comprehensive health care. But what about the
deficit? Reagan's basic teaching says we can't afford economic
justice.
   I say we can't afford not to have economic justice. Poor people
did not cause the deficit. Seniors did not cause the deficit. When
you drive into a blind alley, you have to get out the same way you
got in. Reagan cut the taxes of the rich and the corporations and
doubled the military budget in peacetime.
   We can afford economic justice, but the rich must pay their fair
share of taxes. If the top 600,000 earners who make $192,000 plus,
pay at the 38 percent rate rather than the 28 percent rate, that's
$20 billion. If the corporations pay at 1980 levels, that's another
$16 billion; if they pay at their average level of the 1970s,
that's over $30 billion.
   We can afford economic justice but we must make choices.
   Today we spend some $150 billion a year defending Japan and
Europe 43 years after the war. Europe and Japan have recovered. Yet
their share of total allied spending has dropped from 50 percent
seven years ago to 30 percent today.
   In Europe, the countries have twice the GNP and 1{ times the
population of the Warsaw Pact nations. They can better share the
burden of their own defense.
   We can cut the military without cutting our defense.
   We have no need for a Midgetman missile _ $45 billion for a
weapon we can't use and don't need.
   We have 14 aircraft carrier task forces; the Soviets have none.
We do not need two more at a cost of another $34 billion.
   Star Wars will only make us more insecure. We should stop the
crash ``deployment'' of Star Wars, saving $200 billion to $1
trillion over the next decade.
   But we must also look beyond the effort to make sense.
   We must look beyond the wars in the world, to the possibility of
peace and prosperity.
   We can end the war in Central America, that is not our future.
Our future is with 400 million Latin Americans _ friends,
neighbors, customers who need medicine, tractors, steel,
infrastructure, telecommunications, and grain.
   Our future is not with apartheid; we can end apartheid in South
Africa. Our future is with 560 million Africans, friends, allies,
customers.
   We must relieve Israel of the burden of occupation in the Middle
East. We should not choose sides in the Middle East, but peace.
   And beyond the war, beyond occupation, Israel and Palestine can
trade, and grow and turn the desert into flowers.

<HEAD>Bush Says Issue is Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a recent typical campaign
speech by Republican presidential candidate George Bush:
   
   As I look at it, regardless of the choice on the Democratic
side, the philosophical choice for the American people is going to
be as clearly defined as the choice in 1980 or again the choice in
1984.
   And the central issue in the general election is going to be:
what will America's future be in the 1990s and as we enter the 21st
century? What's our role to be as leader of the free world _ the
only power capable of advancing real peace and freedom. And what's
our place going to be in driving the economic engine of domestic
and global prosperity?
   I still don't sense an isolationistic tendency on the part of
the people. I don't believe the American people are isolationists.
I believe that our people understand and accept the international
responsibilties that are thrust upon us.
   You ask an American, hey, do you think somebody ought to pay
more for defense in the Persian Gulf or NATO or carrying the burden
in the Pacific? Obviously, they'd say yes. But I don't equate that
with fundamental isolationism.
   I believe the American people will accept the burdens of
maintaining a strong national defense _ not just because we want a
military second to none. But because a strong America is going to
lead us to a more peaceful and a less dangerous world.
   The Democrats urge dramatic and dangerous cuts in our military
preparedness for the future. I believe that unilateral cuts to
eliminate or reduce our development and deployment of the MX and
Midgetman missiles, two naval carrier groups, meaningful research
on SDI, is simplistic, naive and very short-sighted.
   If we've learned anything from dealing with the Soviets, we've
learned that dealing from strength results in meaningful arms
control.
   We first learned that lesson nearly 20 years ago when Congress
authorized funding for the anti-ballistic missile system. And soon
after that, the Nixon administration was able to negotiate the ABM
treaty with the Soviet Union. Had we not been willing to do that we
never would have had a treaty.
   In the early 1980s, an influential element within the Democratic
Party urged the United States to enter into a nuclear freeze
agreement. You remember that. Lock it in right now. Leave it the
way it is. At that time, the Soviets had 1,000 intermediate nuclear
force weapons deployed against Europe, warheads. And we had zero.
   Instead of a freeze, a freeze that would have locked in that
asymmetry, that significant imbalance in favor of the Soviets, we
proposed the moral option, the zero option it was called. Zero zero.
   The option called for removal of all Soviet INF missiles and in
return we wouldn't deploy any. And we were castigated for not
knowing how to deal with the Soviets, and how would they ever agree
to anything of this nature?
   But because we had the strength and commitment to deploy, we
achieved an INF treaty. The zero option ultimately became a
reality. The INF missles on both sides will be eliminated and for
the first time in history we have an arms control agreement that
eliminates an entire generation of nuclear weapons.
   It's done in a verifiable way, with relevance in terms of our
desire to get the conventional forces in balance, have relevance in
terms of banning chemical and biological weapons.
   If we had followed the advice of the Democratic left, whose
policies are now being embraced as I look at it by both the men who
seem to be in the forefront of their run for the presidency, we
wouldn't have a treaty.
   But we would have a Soviet imbalance, an asymmetry, 1,000 Soviet
weapons and zero U.S. (weapons).
   The American people overwhelmingly support this treaty. And
properly so. And I hope that the United States Senate will stop all
this foot-dragging _ it's taking far too long in my opinion _ and
will go forward and ratify that treaty before the president goes to
the summit in Moscow at the end of May.

   In Afghanistan, the Soviets are pulling out. And they're pulling
out because we did support, along with some others, the freedom
fighters there. And our steadfast support has worked.
   It hasn't always been easy. But it has worked in Afghanistan.
And our sporadic and less-than-dependable support has failed those
who are fighting a totalitarianism of a similar nature right here
in our own hemisphere in Nicaragua.
   On the domestic side, the Democrats are calling up promise after
promise for new or expanded social programs. I don't know what it
would cost, they haven't told us. But I do know that the single
most important domestic economic problem _ fiscal problem _ facing
our country is the federal budget deficit. And the federal
government can't do it all.
   I don't want it said you're not compasionate, you don't care
about the homeless, the elderly, the uneducated. I care
desperately. But I want to have a strong economy. Public
partnerships can work better: we're sitting on the cutting edge of
some of these problems.
   I believe in the federalist system. And the foremost
responsibility I see of the president now and of the Congress that
appropriates every dime and tells us how to spend every dime is
trying to do better on this federal budget deficit.
   Keeping our economy strong, maintaining a strong national
defense and maintaining a sensible foreign policy are essential if
the United States is to remain the leader of the free world.
   Today, the world's changing, changing rapidly. Communications
are instant, population is growing, Third World nations are
aggressively competing for a market share in the world's economy.
   The challenge to us is: how do we compete successfully in this
dog-eat-dog global economy? During the past decade, the battle
we've been having with our foreign competitors has been having a
profound effect on American business and industry.
   I believe that quality is the answer to the challenge we face
from our foreign competitors. Our economic system is built on
competition. And it works because the truest way to succeed is to
produce the best value for the customer.
   Quality is important, not just to compete in the export market.
It's important to compete right here at home. I believe American
industry can compete with any nation on earth.
   We see new attention to cost control, to lean management,
knowing how to sell in the other guy's market.
   I was wrong. I thought that before now the trade deficit would
be dramatically reduced from the devaluation of the currency, the
dollar vs. the yen particularly.
   It's taken longer than I thought. The Japanese are absorbing
profits to protect market share. They can't do that forever. I'm
optimistic about the continued growth in our exports and a reducing
of this imbalance.
   Exports are up dramatically. Real exports last year increased by
17 percent. Not bad. We strengthened our position as the world's
largest exporter of manufactured goods.
   Next year the U.S. share of the world market is projected to be
50 percent larger than West Germany's and Japan's. Democrats talk
about the decline of American industry: midnight in America. But
they're wrong. Transition and change would be better words. This is
what's happening in our country.
   The fact of the matter is we're in the midst of an industrial
revival in this country.
   A few facts: Between 1974 and 1984, large companies eliminated
nearly 1.5 million factory jobs, but at the same time 41,000 new
companies created almost as many new industrial jobs.
   We're in the midst of the longest peacetime expansion: 15.5
million new jobs. Europeans look at it and call it the American
miracle. And with good reason. That's more jobs created in the last
five years than Europe and Japan have created in the last 20 years.
   And don't believe the myth that those are all bad jobs. Nearly
two-thirds of them are in the higher-paid skilled occupations, over
90 percent are full time.
   I could go on. But I'm in Ohio. And I remember when Mrs. Robert
A. Taft, the wife of the great Ohio senator, said one time, ``I
always find that statistics are hard to swallow and impossible to
digest. The only one I can ever remember is that if all the people
who go to sleep in church were laid end to end, they'd all be a lot
more comfortable.''

   To maintain this strong economy, we've got to get the federal
budget deficit down.
   And we've got to do it by holding the line on spending. And the
answer for the deficit is for the president to make the tough calls
and take the heat.
   Congress has demonstrated that it is unwilling to do that. They
appropriate every dime, spend every dime, tell us how to spend
every dime. The American people see that they're the ones that are
responsible. ...
   And lastly, if I could look back at the end of four years, and
somebody said, what have you accomplished? I'd like to be able to
say I was the education president. I was the person who backed up
those school principals and those good school teachers who know the
name of the kids, that are teaching those four values: reading,
'riting, 'rithmetic and respect in the classroom.
   I want to lead the federal government to do more in helping for
the disadvantaged, do better a job in helping young families just
getting started to save through tax exemptions, save so that they
can educate their own kids. It's a partnership. We can't turn to
the federal government to do it all. But we must do a better job on
education.
   I think people are going to go into that voting booth next fall,
and they're going to say: who has the value that we believe in, who
has the experience to lead this, the greatest countryon the face of
the earth, who has the stability, the integrity, to get the job
done?
   I wouldn't be asking for your vote if I didn't feel that I am
that man.
   I will never apologize for the United States of America. I will
keep her strong, I will lead her, I will reach out with compassion
to all Americans, to make them understand that this indeed is the
best, the most generous nation on the face of the earth.

   Before the ink has dried on ad posters and
theater tickets, RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video has announced it
will distribute the upcoming epic adventure, ``Willow.''
   No release date was given for home video buyers.
   The $35 million George Lucas fantasy opens on May 20, and with
an advertising budget of $20 million is expected to be one of the
season's top celluloid winners.
   It is a beautifully filmed tale of good versus evil, pulling out
all the parables from the story of Moses to ``Return of the Jedi.''
There are virtually no stars, the hero is a dwarf and special
effects from the Lucas bag of tricks abound.
   ``The combination of George Lucas producing and Ron Howard
directing is sure to result in a wonderful film that will be a big
worldwide hit both theatrically and in home video,'' said Robert
Blattner, president of RCA-Columbia Pictures.
   A superhit that's already proven itself will also be available
on home video in the fall _ ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.''
   MCA Home Video and the Pepsi Cola Co. plan a $25 million
campaign to sell the videocassette, which will retail for a low
$24.95.
   The movie, produced by Steven Spielberg, tells the story of an
endearing little alien from another world who becomes marooned on
Earth. It is befriended and given sanctuary by children who protect
it from government agents, and who help E.T. return home.
   ``E.T.,'' the biggest grosser of all time, has made more than
$228 million in film rentals, and has an estimated worldwide box
office of nearly $500 million.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Throw Momma From the Train'' and
``Julia Julia.''

   ``Throw Momma From the Train'' (Orion Home Video, VHS@Beta,
$89.98, Rated R)
   
   ``Throw Momma From the Train'' could have been titled, ``How to
Kill Your Mother and Cure Writer's Block.''
   A hopelessly bad writer with a hellion of a mother meets a
college professor who can't get past the first three words of a
book he's trying to write and despises his far more successful
former wife.
   Inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a Train,'' the
aspiring writer proposes a Hitchcockian double murder, and ensnares
the unwitting professor in his plot.
   You have to like a movie like that.
   Yet this film, a box-office sleeper starring Danny DeVito as the
mother-hater and Billy Crystal who is terrific as the schlemiel
professor, never quite fulfills the potential of its hilarious
premise.
   DeVito, who showed himself a true comic genius in his TV role as
Louie DePalma in ``Taxi,'' is only fleetingly funny in this film.
   This also represents DeVito's debut as a feature film director,
and he doesn't rev ``Throw Momma'' up to the comic pitch one would
hope for.
   Still, Crystal's energy and ingenious timing are enough to keep
the film moving. And he gets hilarious help from Anne Ramsey who
won a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her work as the Momma with
the face of a harpy and a voice that makes nails on a chalkboard
sound sweet by comparison.
   As DeVito tries to draw Crystal into his matricide scheme, he
says, ``Look. Just meet her. Maybe she's someone you'd like to
kill.''
   It is no small feat for a film to make matricide acceptable. And
often very funny.

   ``Julia and Julia''
   
   Peter Del Monte's ``Julia and Julia'' is the kind of movie one
would rather forget. It is so jumbled, so poorly written, acted and
edited that it makes ``Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'' look like a
work of genius.
   It is not a film one should pay money to see on the big screen.
However, you won't be too angry if you merely rent a videocassette.
   The story, oblique at best, revolves around Julia (Kathleen
Turner) whose husband, Paolo (Gabriel Byrne) dies in a car crash on
their wedding day. A few years later, still sloshing through an
uneventful and melancholic life in Trieste, she returns home one
night to find Paolo and their son.
   However, in this ``new'' life, Julia also has taken a lover,
Daniel (Sting), who is given to brutalizing her.
   Throughout the remainder of the movie, Julia roams from this
``ghost'' life to her ``real'' life. But it's hard to separate
illusion from reality.
   It's also hard having any real feeling for the characters
because, with the exception of Sting, they are transparent and not
terribly interesting _ especially Turner.
   As an actress, Kathleen Turner's ability is questionable: She
seems to be the end result of a well-oiled hype machine. In ``Julia
Julia,'' she's about as convincing and compelling as a box of
prunes, given to long intakes of air and misplaced angst where she
should be a confused, tragic heroine.
   Nor is she particularly sensual _ seemingly her strong point, if
we are to believe the hype machine. Rather, she is largely
narcoleptic.
   Byrne does the best he can with a limp script, but remains tepid
at best.

   ``Rock of Life'' (RCA) _ Rick Springfield
   
   Rick Springfield bares his soul on ``Rock of Life,'' his first
album in three years. He attributes the hiatus to burnout, which he
describes on the title cut and ``World Start Turning.''
   On the latter he sings, ``Made a promise to myself _ I'll never
get that low again.''
   The problem is that Springfield's confessional is delivered, for
the most part, via mechanical, repetitive arrangements and layered
harmonies compressed into music that's obviously aimed at Top 40
radio. The result is a record that sounds impersonal despite its
autobiographical nature.
   It's too bad, because Springfield went into the studio with
something to say. ``God bless the house, the car and the TV; they
built us a prison without any locks,'' he sings on ``Tear It All
Down.''
   But the only arrangements that work are ``Honeymoon in Beirut,''
a dead ringer for Hall and Oates, and a thundering cover of the
Small Faces' ``(If You Think You're) Groovy.'' Elsewhere,
Springfield lets his blues get buried in overdubs that turn ``Rock
of Life'' to rubble.

   Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987 (MCA) _ ``Southern by the Grace
of God''
   Now ask yourself, does the world really need another 13-minute
version of ``Free Bird,'' sung this time by a few thousand off-key
concertgoers from Dallas?
   Of course not.
   But such worldly questions obviously never faze record company
executives. That's why records such as ``Southern by the Grace of
God,'' credited to the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987 are stacked
in the stores.
   Survivors of this influential Southern rock band, which lost
three members in a 1977 plane crash, reunited for a tour last year
to cash in on the group's memory. Johnny Van Zant replaced his
brother, Ronnie, as the singer and frontman for the new Skynyrd.
   Not real, as the copywriters like to say, but an incredible
simulation.
   You can't argue too much about a tour, since worse things have
been done in the name of nostalgia. A live record is another story.
   In an attempt to pay tribute to such songs as ``Free Bird'' and
``Sweet Home Alabama,'' the reconstituted Skynyrd only demeans
them. How can expecting fans to pay money to hear other fans sing a
cherished song be viewed as anything but an insult? Why ask fans to
pay for sub-par reruns of songs when the originals are easily
available?
   Even setting aside the concept, the record is sloppy. It opens
with an address to a crowd in Dallas, switches to Atlanta a few
songs later, then quickly heads back to Dallas. A little editing
would have eased the sense of disorientation. The gratuitious
profanity can go, too.
   It's also one of those recordings better suited to the CD format
than an awkward two-album set. ``Free Bird,'' with 13:11 of music,
fills an entire side.
   The surviving Skynyrds don't musically embarrass themselves, but
that's not the point. There's no excuse for turning Lynyrd Skynyrd
into another ``Beatlemania.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Casebook of Survival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Her life is a casebook of survival, and
Patricia Neal is talking about it these days with complete candor,
revealing her forbidden love for Gary Cooper and the deception by
her former husband, writer Roald Dahl.
   She is calling attention to her autobiography, ``As I Am,'' by
doing interviews; three a day is all she can manage.
   The effects of her near-fatal stroke and a Job-like series of
tragedies are still apparent: difficulty in walking, furtive
searches for words and memories. But she dismisses her failings
with the familiar throaty laugh.
   Miss Neal's voice retains that mellow quality that fascinated
viewers of ``The Fountainhead,'' ``A Face in the Crowd,'' ``Hud,''
for which she received the Academy Award as best actress, and ``The
Subject Was Roses.'' It reflects the years as wife and mother in
England, but the undertones of her beginnings in Packard, Ky., are
unmistakable. And there is no mistaking that she remains, at 62, a
rare beauty.
   ``As I Am,'' written with Richard DeNeut, tells it all. She
arrived in Hollywood in 1948 after a smashing success on Broadway
in ``Another Part of the Forest.'' All of the studios sought her,
but she signed a Warner Bros. contract because Jack Warner promised
her the hit play ``John Loves Mary.'' Her co-star was Ronald Reagan.
   ``When I started `John Loves Mary,' Jane Wyman announced that
she was divorcing Ronnie,'' Miss Neal recalled, ``so he didn't have
an easy time on that film. Then I did `The Fountainhead,' and
Ronnie and I both went to London to do `The Hasty Heart.' We lived
side by side in a hotel, and while we never dated, we often went to
dinner together.
   ``I was in love with someone he didn't know about; no one did.
And he was still very much enamored of Jane Wyman. After we
finished the picture, he went back and started going with his
present wife, Nancy.''
   The romance that no one knew about was with her ``Fountainhead''
co-star, Gary Cooper. It had to be secret, because he was married
to the socialite Veronica ``Rocky'' Balfe.
   Miss Neal writes that Cooper once hit her because she dated Kirk
Douglas and that she had an abortion after becoming pregnant by
Cooper.
   Why is she finally telling the story of her love for Cooper?
   ``Well, if I write a book on my life, and I leave Gary Cooper
out, it won't be a real, true story,'' she said. ``He was my great
passion for a long time. Looking back, I still adore him and will
always adore him. He was `my man.'
   ``When it first started, I didn't think of marrying Gary ever.
It was just my quick love, and I hoped that no one would know. But
I really loved him and it went on and on. In the end we had to
break it up.''
   In 1953 Miss Neal married the writer of mystery and children's
stories, Roald Dahl. They settled in Great Missenden, near London,
and had three children. The tragedies began: Baby Theo was hit by a
New York taxi and nearly died; young Olivia died suddenly of
measles.
   Miss Neal suffered a massive stroke while preparing to film
``Seven Women'' with John Ford. Only after 21 days did her doctor
tell Dahl that his wife, who was pregnant, would live.
   ``It was a hard time to learn to talk again, to walk again,''
she said. ``I didn't know one word from the other. My son had great
cards with words written on them _ `he,' `she,' `cat,' `dog' _ and
he would hold them up to me.''
   Recovery was long and slow, and she was constantly driven by
Dahl. Their fourth child, Ophelia, was born with no ill effects
from her mother's illness.
   In 1968 Dahl pushed his wife into doing the film ``The Subject
Was Roses'' much against her will, though she was later glad that
she did it. She continued acting in films and television, always
returning to Great Missenden. What she didn't know was that Dahl
was carrying on an affair with Felicity Crossland, an English
fashion coordinator.
   ``My husband was a tricky man, it turned out,'' Miss Neal said.
``I don't know how many years he had other women. In the end he
wanted a divorce so he could marry his now-wife.
   ``I was so bitter! You have no idea how horrible I was. But all
of a sudden it vanished. I don't feel bitter anymore.''
   The family stayed in England, and Miss Neal now lives in a New
York apartment and a summer home on Martha's Vineyard. Gary
Cooper's daughter, Maria, who first contacted her after the
strokes, had recommended a Connecticut abbey where Miss Neal found
solace in retreats. She wrote her book there. It was also through
Maria that she met Rocky Cooper.
   ``When Rocky's second husband died, I wrote her a letter,'' Miss
Neal said. ``She was so delighted with it, and I got a letter from
her. It was written on the birthday of my darling Olivia, the one
who died. It's extraordinary how these things happen on a certain
day.'' A meeting was arranged, and the two women shared memories of
the man they both loved.
   How has she managed to survive her disasters?
   ``When something happens, you think it's going to kill you,''
she replied. ``But it doesn't kill you, so you live through that.
When the second one happens, you get stronger. You get stronger all
the time, all the time. Even though I have a filthy temper when
things go wrong and I have no control over them, I realize that I
have no control.
   ``I have survived so far. I've been told by three fortunetellers
that I'm going to live till 95. So you can see that I have some
years left.''

<HEAD>The Artists: New Arts Center Guards Against Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge water tank hangs suspended between
the dome of Egypt's new opera house and the elaborate tiers of its
flower-shaped ceiling.
   The tank underlines the designers' determination that the
beige-colored, neo-Islamic-style Cairo Education and Culture Center
won't suffer the same fate as the Opera House, its historic
predecessor: destruction by fire.
   Built in 1869 for the inauguration of the Suez Canal, the ornate
old Opera House went up in flames in 1971, an unexplained fire that
left Egypt's culture lovers bereft and homeless.
   The new Japanese-built center houses a 1,300-seat opera house,
two smaller theaters, a museum, a library, an art gallery, a
conference hall and artistic training rooms. Still, everyone from
builders to the media refer to the center as ``The New Opera.''
   It was turned over to the Culture Ministry on March 10 and will
have its official inauguration on Oct. 10.
   The loss of the old house, in which plays for the common man
were as likely to be presented as grand opera, was a trauma for
Egypt. Thousands of Cairenes stood in horror on Oct. 28, 1971,
watching their beloved Opera House burn for several days.
   Cairo's main firefighting station was less than 100 yards away,
but experts said the fire could not be stopped. The building was
primarily made of timber, and hundreds of costumes and props helped
feed the flames.
   ``I was there, with many Egyptians, standing and crying as we
watched it burn,'' said Magda Saleh, 43, the new opera's director.
   Fire precautions have been installed. The water tank has a
capacity of 78,000 gallons.
   There's also fire-resistant fabrics and materials throughout the
complex, sprinkler and smoke-detection systems, 158 fire
extinguishers and a huge fire-resistant curtain between the stage
and the audience.
   Miss Saleh, a former prima ballerina with the ballet company of
Egypt's Academy for Arts, expects big things from the center.
   ``It's a magnificent facility,'' she said. ``We anticipate it
will revolutionize culture in Egypt, and we hope the whole region
and internationally as well.''
   The complex, located on Cairo's posh Zamalek Island, was
financed by a 1984 grant from the Japanese government of 6.5
billion yen, then worth $30 million.
   No expense has been spared: Swedish pine floors, Italian marble
and Japanese electronics. The complex's interior color schemes vary
from light pink to crimson and dark coral, and the sharply sloping
main auditorium features plush floor seats topped by
horseshoe-shaped tiers of boxes.
   In the main hall, most walls are covered with ceramics, which
Japanese architects said was for acoustics as much as for easy
maintenance. The ceiling is fiberglass and Czech crystal, shaped
like a kind of flower uniting the Egyptian lotus and the Japanese
cherry blossom.
   The stage is large by world standards, with a maximum width of
53 feet, a height of 30 feet and a depth of 109 feet.
   A Japanese construction company, Kajima Corp., built the
seven-story complex in 34 months.
   Miss Saleh said she is organizing an elaborate inauguration
ceremony as she tries to piece together the opera's first season.
   At the Oct. 10 inauguration gala, traditional Egyptian and
Japanese classical music and Western classics will be performed,
climaxing a month of celebrations that will include open-air
festivals along the Nile River outside the complex's front gate.
   For the inaugural season, Miss Saleh has booked the London
Festival and the Paris Opera ballet troupes and hopes to sign
Moscow's Bolshoi ballet, personally requested by President Hosni
Mubarak.
   The London Festival ballet will open the season on Oct. 25 with
``Les Sylphides,'' a ballet that has never been performed in Egypt.
   ``The opera will be a home for Egyptian artists, but I have also
been contacting African, Asian and Arab groups,'' Miss Saleh said.
``We will not be limited to opera, ballet and symphony. Any variety
of excelled art will be invited.''
   She said ticket prices for the new center have not been set but
that she is aiming to keep them fairly low so average Egyptians
will not be deprived of the arts.
   Mubarak specifically asked for the opera house on a visit to
Japan in 1983. It raised eyebrows that his request for aid should
be for a culture center instead of other, more pressing economic
needs.
   Miss Saleh, Egypt's prima ballerina from 1966-71, said she hopes
the complex will become an educational center, a gathering place
for young artists and a place where young Egyptians can learn to
appreciate the arts.
   One stumbling block she expects is money, both to maintain the
huge complex and to attract internationally acclaimed performers.
She would not say how much money the financially strapped
government has budgeted for the opera house, but she said she hopes
to receive subsidies from the Culture Ministry and to start local
and regional systems of fund raising.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Slice of Southern Life for Bruce Hornsby</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia is more than just Bruce Hornsby's home
state. It's the source of the preachers, pregnant girls, gossips
and good ol' boys who populate his slice-of-Southern-life songs.
   ``A lot of our inspiration comes from Southern literature. ...
This album, to us, we tried to make it a musical version of a
short-story collection,'' Hornsby said of his ``Scenes From the
Southside,'' the follow-up to 1986's platinum record ``The Way It
Is.''
   ``I read a lot _ I read a lot of fiction _ and I guess that
influences my writing,'' said Hornsby, who cited little-known
Southern writers Lee Smith and William Hoffman as favorites. ``I
want it to have that same sort of quality.''
   On his debut album with his band, The Range, Hornsby was able to
do just that, racking up three hit singles, including the title
track. His success was the result of persistence as much as talent
_ Hornsby was rejected repeatedly until signing with RCA Records
and watching his career take off.
   The new record is filled with characters from Hornsby's days in
his hometown of Williamsburg, Va., from the shady evangelists of
``Jacob's Ladder'' and ``Defenders of the Flag'' to the small-town
gossips of ``The Show Goes On.''
   ``We're just writing about things that happen in Virginia, and
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell certainly come from Virginia,''
said Hornsby, who has lived in California for the past several
years.
   ``Everybody thinks we wrote about Jim Bakker, but we've known
about this stuff for years: people in high places doing less than
admirable things.''
   Going into the studio to record the second album was a much
different experience from the first time around, Hornsby said. His
brother and writing partner, John, was in law school, forcing
Hornsby to write more alone; there was also pressure to produce
another hit.
   ``Frankly, the pressure on the first album was more intense,
because it was more of a survival thing,'' said Hornsby. ``If that
record had just come out and stiffed, we might not have gotten
another shot.
   ``The pressure of this one is different. It's like, well, if we
fell on our faces last time, nobody would've known about it; if we
fall on our faces this time, everybody knows about it. There's
always that sophomore jinx thing.''
   To fight that, ``Scenes From the Southside'' is a bit different
from the first album _ ``a lot more jams, there's a lot of soloing,
a lot more piano. It's a lot more stretched out,'' Hornsby said
during a recent interview.
   He's also not too worried about critical reception of the record.
   ``We write the song because it means something to us as a story
from our past, and musically as an interesting combination of
styles,'' he said. ``That's what we think about _ not whether it's
going to go along with the new Pebbles record.''
   Hornsby was referring to the single by Pebbles called
``Girlfriend'' which has shot up the record charts and remains in
the Top 10.
   Hornsby's first single from the new LP, ``The Valley Road,''
features a piano riff over a straight-ahead rock beat much in the
style of jazz keyboardist McCoy Tyner, Hornsby said.
   ``One thing's for sure: `The Valley Road' doesn't sound a ...
thing like anything on the radio. That's either the good news or
the bad news; we'll see,'' he said.
   Hornsby, an accomplished accordionist in addition to his piano
and organ playing, has also kept busy working with other artists.
Huey Lewis, who scored a Top 10 hit with his version of ``Jacob's
Ladder,'' again recruited Hornsby for his new album; Lewis returned
the favor by playing harmonica on ``Defenders of the Flag.''
   Don Henley and Hornsby have co-written a song for the ex-Eagle's
next solo album; Hornsby has also contributed accordion work on
upcoming albums by Dave Stewart of the Eurhythmics, Kim Carnes and
Patti Austin.
   But it's still the Southern social observations that Hornsby
enjoys best. And after several years in Los Angeles, he's moving
back to Williamsburg, Va., where he'll store away more material for
future albums.
   Unless ...
   ``Who knows? Maybe we'll move back there and write about L.A.,''
Hornsby said, his voice giving way to a laugh.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Hughes Hoaxer Hypes Houston Homicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mention ``the hoax'' and Clifford Irving casts his
eyes downward, shakes his head and offers a smirk of mild disgust
that 16 years and six books later the subject still pops up.
   Irving would like to talk about books he has written, not about
the chicanery that put him in prison in the early 1970s after he
duped a publisher out of $650,000 by claiming he had compiled an
autobiography of the late reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes.
   The bearded, pensive New Yorker is something of a recluse
himself now, living in a small Mexican mountain community. He has
emerged to talk about his latest book _ a chronicle of the 1982
murders of a Houston lawyer and his wife, plotted by their
daughter, carried out by her boyfriend, uncovered by a private eye.
   But he knows the Hughes scam will dog him to the end.
   ``I just don't want to talk about it because I don't think it's
fair. It's so long ago. Whatever penalties there are for avoiding
the question, I will endure them. I just don't want to discuss
it,'' he said.
   But ask Irving about ``Daddy's Girl: The Campbell Murder Case''
(Summit Books, $19.95) and he'll ramble on about the underbelly of
American life and the criminal justice system he says he discovered
while researching _ and ultimately becoming a player in _ the Texas
case.
   In June 1982, James M. Campbell, 55, and his wife, Virginia, 50,
were killed by a .45-caliber pistol while they slept. The killer
fired over their two grandchildren, who were asleep at the foot of
the bed.
   Nearly three years later, a 23-year-old private detective named
Kim Paris romanced David Duval West into confessing to the Campbell
murders. He was convicted of murder. The Campbells' daughter,
Cynthia Ray, was found guilty in a separate trial of plotting the
crime in order to gain an inheritance.
   For Irving, what started as a trip to Houston in search of a
good dentist ended as a two-year investigation culminating with the
author taking the stand to dispute the testimony of a key
prosection witness.
   ``My interest was superficial at the beginning _ a beautiful
young private eye seduces a murderer into confession,'' Irving said
during a promotional swing through Boston. ``Then I got to know the
murderer _ the alleged murderer _ and I wasn't so sure he had done
it.''
   Irving testified in the West trial that a witness he had
interviewed lied on the stand when he said Irving had made him get
drunk in order to obtain information. He battled with a prosecutor.
   ``I was so involved at this point that I couldn't believe it,''
Irving said. ``I certainly had never intended it.''
   His involvement stretched to attending judge's conferences with
attorneys, taping courtroom proceedings despite a court ban and
developing close friendships with lawyers on both sides of the
case. The experience was uniquely Texan.
   ``Texas is different. It's still the frontier, the Wild West,''
said Irving, dressed in a brown tweed jacket and a pair of
elephant-hide boots. ``Certainly the intimacy of the courtroom is
different. It's clubby. A Philadelphia lawyer who knew what I was
doing said you could never do this in Philadelphia, you could never
get that close.''
   Since the Campbell trials ended last year, the 55-year-old
Irving has returned to San Miguel Allende, population 20,000, where
he lives with the youngest of his three sons.
   Irving's steely blue eyes and public love affairs once commanded
as much attention as the hoax. He's living alone now, adding that
after four divorces, ``I'm not very good at domesticity.''
   He's working on a new project, a ``twisty novel about the ethics
of the law'' set in Texas. A screenplay about young love in the
1950s is on hold because of a strike by Hollywood writers. CBS is
negotiating to make a TV movie out of the Campbell case. And he
hopes an Oliver Stone screenplay of his 1982 novel ``Tom Mix and
Pancho Villa'' will get produced.
   Irving says credibility is no longer an issue.
   ``I don't think about that anymore,'' he said. ``I know I'm
credible. Everyone in Houston knows they can count on me. This book
was well researched.''
   In 1972, though, Irving told McGraw Hill Inc., that he had
compiled an autobiography of Howard Hughes as the result of 100
secret meetings, which never took place. The book was deemed a
fraud, Irving was sentenced to 2{ years in prison and he became an
instant celebrity, appearing on the cover of Time as ``Con Man of
the Year.''
   For Irving, it's nothing more than a footnote to his career, not
how he wishes to be defined.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Alabama Fights For Eminence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alabama, whose rousing instrumentals and
moving ballads have set the standard for country music in the
1980s, is fighting to maintain its eminence.
   The group with foot-stomping fiddle tunes and mesmerizing
melodies has drastically reduced its concert appearances, is
winning fewer awards and learning that No. 1 records are no longer
automatic.
   Nevertheless, Alabama guitarist Teddy Gentry says:
   ``We've been written off several times, but my feeling is we're
together and making the best music we've ever made and things are
better in more ways than ever. We've worked out any problems we
had. We're contented.''
   The four-member band has sold about 30 million records in the
past eight years since the group, which hails from Fort Payne,
Ala., left a beach bar in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where they played for
tips.
   They won back-to-back Grammy awards in 1983 and 1984 for
``Mountain Music'' and ``The Closer You Get.'' The group starred in
a network TV special and performed up to 300 days on the road each
year.
   But as new acts came along and country fans formed new
allegiances, Alabama now finds its once-torrid pace a bit tempered.
   Gentry said the group will perform 80 to 90 concerts this year,
down from 130 in 1987, and one-third of their frantic schedule five
years ago.
   ``You have to cut back in markets for a year or two,'' he said.
   The group won dozens of awards this decade, but their bulging
trophy case has not inherited as much hardware in the past couple
of years.
   The Judds, Highway 101 and the Forester Sisters have won some of
the awards that Alabama had a lock on a few years ago.
   ``We can grow as artists and writers,'' Gentry said in an
interview. ``We've got a lot of good years left. It would be a
detriment to win more awards.''
   In November, their personal and autobiographical song, ``Tar
Top,'' was the first Alabama single to fail to reach No. 1 on the
country music charts after 21 in a row spanning a remarkable eight
years.
   ``We felt it was different and we agreed to put it out even if
it might not make No. 1,'' Gentry said. ``We wanted it out for the
band and for the fans.
   ``Another No. 1 would not have done us any good at that point,''
he said. ``It was a controversial song and it got people to talk
about the group again. It accomplished what we set out for it to do.
   ``It got the other record companies off our backs. They had
parties and celebrated.''
   The group _ three of the four are cousins _ bounced back with a
No. 1 record in January, ``Face to Face.''
   Though their career has evened off, the band can boast of
stirring hit records such as ``Dixieland Delight'' and ``Old
Flame,'' and sensuous, softer songs such as ``Touch Me When We're
Dancing'' and ``Feels So Right.''
   They've had so many hits that at concerts they are forced to
perform three medleys and trim the length of several other songs.
   ``We have to leave out a bunch,'' said Gentry, who once laid
carpet for a living.
   They pioneered the sound of country bands and their success led
Nashville record companies to sign other groups such as Exile and
Restless Heart.
   Says Joe Bonsall, lead singer for the rival Oak Ridge Boys,
``They are the greatest act that's ever been in our business.''
   Gentry, analyzing the band's success, points to versatility,
organization, energy and other factors.
   ``We've been able to write our own songs,'' he said. ``Early in
your career, you don't get pitched the good songs that others do.
We've put together the best organization I know of, from management
to the road crew. They've been with us for years.
   ``We've tried to act as good businessmen. We go to the functions
and meet the people and do those things.
   ``We've had a range of material,'' he continued. ``Kids identify
with some of it, and the good ol' boys with gun racks in their
pickup trucks like others, and there are the gentle love songs that
women like. We like our range of music and we're capable of doing a
lot of songs.
   ``We've not been afraid to change; we've been independent.
   ``There's a real feeling by the people that we give them
everything we've got _ all the feeling, all the energy we can for
that applause. The people know when you're playing for yourself or
when you're playing for them.
   ``I like to sit and watch the people come in to the concert and
study them _ `I wonder what he does for a living.' It amazes me
that so many types of people enjoy our music.''

   Predictions of a $2 exchange rate for the
British pound in the near future have been reinforced by sterling's
sharp rise on unfounded rumors that the British government's key
advocate of currency weakness was preparing to quit.
   Money traders said action focused on the pound Monday largely
because of rumors, later denied by the British government, that
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was about to resign.
   As the top British treasury official, Lawson is seen as an
important opponent of an expensive pound. In his view, the rising
currency could hurt Britain's economy by making exports less
competitive.

   Technical factors and a lack of significant
market-affecting news have left oil futures prices mixed.
   Crude oil futures declined Monday in quiet trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, while gasoline futures rose and heating
oil mostly was lower.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of
U.S. crude, settled at $17.54 per barrel, down 20 cents from
Friday's close. Other contract months showed smaller losses.
   June contracts for unleaded regular gasoline edged up 0.07 cent
to close at 51.59 cents a gallon. June heating oil advanced 0.25
cent to 47.67 cents a gallon, but most other contract months fell.
   Dealers said prices were pushed mostly by technical market
factors, although nervousness regarding OPEC's scheduled June 8
meeting appeared to be a negative factor for crude prices.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
failed to reach an agreement on cutting production among its
members and in conjunction with non-OPEC producers at a recent

   ``The sellers just kind of woke up,'' said Linda Simard, a

``There was no news that anyone was speaking about at all.''

<TEXT>
   Entrepreneurs are playing an increasingly
important role in leading the nation's largest black-owned
companies, according to a new survey.
   Black Enterprise magazine's latest annual survey of the top 100
black-owned industrial and service companies, released Monday,
indicates black entrepreneurs are becoming more active in sectors
ranging from manufacturing and advertising to construction and
franchising.
   The entrepreneurs, many of whom are using non-traditional
financing techniques to acquire and restructure companies, are
different from traditional executives who have been with the same
company for years, working to build it up.
   The rise of black entrepreneurs mirrors developments in U.S.
companies in general, many of which have been taken over or been
forced to restructure to face competition and an uncertain economy.
   A key example is Wall Street attorney Reginald F. Lewis, who
heads TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., by far the largest
black-owned company. New York-based TLC Beatrice, a food processor
and distributor formed from the $985 million leveraged buyout of
Beatrice International, also was the fastest-growing, according to
the survey.
   In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of the
target company with sales of its assets or from its cash flow.
   TLC Beatrice was the first black-owned company to make more than
$1 billion in annual sales and it posted revenue of $1.8 billion in
1987. Its 61 businesses include Butterball turkeys and Good Humor
ice cream.
   The buyout of Beatrice ``places Lewis on the cutting edge of
corporate finance and gives him access to Europe, Latin America and
Asia, three of the world's fastest-growing markets,'' the survey
stated.
   Another black entrepreneur, J. Bruce Llewellyn of Philadelphia
Coca-Cola Bottling Co., has propelled the company into the No. 3
slot on the list with $166 million in sales last year. Llewellyn
has acquired several profitable companies through joint ventures
with other black entrepreneurs and has added 36 new routes to his
bottling operation.
   He recently purchased another Coke bottling franchise in
Wilmington, Del., and expects to surpass $200 million in sales this
year.
   Other black business operators _ such as Gary L. White of Trans
Jones Inc.-Jones Transfer Co. and C. Everett Wallace of City &
Suburban Distributors Inc. _ have used leveraged buyouts to put
their companies in the top 100. They are in the process of selling
off their nonperforming assets and setting up strict financial
controls, the survey says.
   Trans Jones, a transportation services company based in Monroe,
Mich., is seventh on the list with $79.3 million in 1987 revenue.
City & Suburban, a Chicago-based beer distributor, rolled out $37
million in sales. It tied for 16th place with Community Foods Inc.,
a food retailer based in Baltimore.
   Other companies on the top 100 list include:
   _Johnson Publishing Co. Inc., second-ranked after TLC Beatrice,
which saw its growth boosted by its cosmetics and hair-care
products and its syndicated ``Ebony-Jet Showcase'' television show.
   The Chicago-based company, which had $201.6 million in sales
last year, markets Fashion Fair products and publishes Ebony, Jet
and Ebony Man.
   _Construction firm H.J. Russell & Co., ranked No. 4, continues
to show its strength in competitive bidding for contracts and has
branched out aggressively into real estate development with
Gibraltar Land Inc., the survey stated. Russell, based in Atlanta,
posted sales of $141.9 million.
   _Motown Industries, No. 5 with $100 million in sales. The
Los-Angeles based entertainment company has sought to restructure
its operations, infusing $38 million into its records subsidiary
for the development and promotion of new artists.

<HEAD>Central Bank Chief Says Dollar Parity is Not Part of Free-Trade
Deal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All monetary figures are U.S. unless otherwise noted.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

   The Canadian dollar's sharp two-year rise stemmed
mainly from higher interest rates, not from any secret deal under
the nation's pending U.S. trade pact, according to the head of
Canada's central bank.
   Bank of Canada governor John Crow said Monday that the Canadian
dollar's nearly 31 percent rise since February 1986 came as
Canadian interest rates were being driven higher to help cool
domestic inflationary pressures.
   The Canadian dollar rose from an all-time low of 69 U.S. cents
in February 1986 to more than 81 cents in April.
   Opposition parties and other commentators have suggested that
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney sacrificed the advantages of a weaker
currency _ which makes Canadian products relatively cheaper in
foreign markets _ in order to secure the Free Trade Agreement with
the United States.
   ``There is no deal on the exchange rate at all,'' Crow said at a
meeting with foreign correspondents.
   The trade pact was signed Jan. 2 and is to be ratified later
this year. It would eliminate all tariffs and dismantle many
non-tariff barriers in what is already the world's biggest trading
partnership.
   Some Canadian exporters have complained that Canadian dollar's
rise had cost them foreign business. For example, Noranda Inc., the
forestry and resource giant, has said it lost $80 million in profit
last year because of the currency's surge.
   Crow acknowledged such complaints, but noted that the Canadian
currency's rise had been halted last month. Bank of Canada figures
released last week indicated the central bank spent more than $1
billion during April to keep a lid on the Canadian currency, which
closed Monday at 80.72 U.S. cents.
   Crow also said the trade pact did not mean the two currencies
eventually would become equal.
   He drew a distinction between the U.S.-Canada pact, an agreement
on goods and services, and the kind of currency union that could
emerge in the 12-nation European Economic Community under a
proposed European Central Bank.
   Looking ahead to the June 19-21 economic summit in Toronto, Crow
said he concurred with the finance ministers of the seven major
industrialized countries that the U.S. dollar had fallen far enough
against other currencies in the past two years.
   The so-called Group of Seven nations involved in the talks are
the United States, Canada, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and
Italy.
   Asked what he would like to see emerge from the summit, Crow
said that whatever initiatives were taken or statements made, he
hoped ``they don't give the impression we're off on another round
of world inflation.''
   Crow also expressed concern about inflationary pressures in
Canada, which had the developed world's highest economic growth
rate of 5.75 percent last year and anticipates a 17 percent
increase in factory investment this year.
   But with latest figures showing growth stalled at the start of
this year, he forecast reduced demand in 1988, which he said should
help curb inflation.

   Workers will begin assembling cars at the
new Diamond-Star Motors plant two months ahead of schedule in early
September, due to quick plant construction, the automaker has
announced.
   Construction of the $650 million Diamond-Star plant, a joint
venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors, finished several
months early, allowing the assembly line to start rolling sooner
than expected.
   ``We're very pleased with the progress of the plant construction
and have been able to remain ahead of schedule throughout the
start-up process,'' Diamond-Star Chairman G. Glenn Garder said in a
news release issued Monday.
   Diamond-Star Motors will build a two-door, front-wheel-drive
coupe for the 1989 model year. The car will be sold at prices
starting below $10,000.
   Chrysler will market the vehicle as the Plymouth Laser.
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, which has 205 dealerships in the
United States, also will distribute the car but has not announced
its name.
   The 2 million-square-foot assembly plant eventually is to
produce 240,000 cars annually and employ 2,900 people. Plans call
for Diamond-Star to build a compact sedan at its Normal plant
beginning in 1989.
   Diamond-Star officials have said the assembly-line workers will
decide for themselves if they want to organize a union.
   The state-of-the-art auto plant features high-technology
machinery and equipment including robotics on the final assmbly
line. Supervisors and workers have received intense training
courses, including trips to Japan to study new methods and
management techniques.
   Chrysler and Mitsubishi have exchanged parts, engines and cars
for nearly 20 years but the Diamond-Star project marks their first
production partnership.

   A woman was found guilty of killing her husband
and a woman to collect more than $175,000 in insurance, and the
prosecutor says the conviction in the nation's first
death-by-product-tampering trial will stop drug tamperers.
   Stella Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn, was convicted Monday of
all five counts in the deaths of her 52-year-old husband, Bruce,
and Sue Katherine Snow, 40, also of Auburn.
   Federal court jurors, who deliberated nearly five days, said
Mrs. Nickell's daughter's testimony against her mother proved
crucial. Mrs. Nickell, scheduled for sentencing June 17, could
receive life in prison. Prosecutors also are considering state
murder charges.
   ``It was all there for (jurors) to make this decision,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida said, adding that the verdict
will ``be a deterrent'' to would-be drug tamperers.
   Jury foreman Murray M. Andrews, 55, said the panel was split
11-1 in favor of conviction through its first three votes.
   Juror Laurel Holliday, who wept when the verdict was announced,
told U.S. District Judge William Dwyer on Monday she received an
anonymous call Friday from a woman who said, ``Don't you all know
she (Mrs. Nickell) failed the lie detector test?''
   Results of Mrs. Nickell's polygraph test were not introduced as
evidence.
   Ms. Holliday said she told no other jurors about the call and
vowed to disregard the information when the judge told her to do so.
   Defense lawyer Tom Hillier, who declined Dwyer's offer to excuse
Ms. Holliday, said Monday night he planned to appeal.
   ``Assuming the 11-1 split included a vote of not guilty by the
same juror who reported having been tampered with earlier this
morning, then it's my belief that that's no coincidence and that
that has to be investigated if for no other reason than to insure
the integrity of the jury system,'' he said.
   The testimony of Cindy Hamilton, Mrs. Nickell's 28-year-old
daughter, was decisive. ``I think without Cindy's testimony there
were, you might say, too many missing links in the chain of
evidence,'' he said.
   Ms. Hamilton testified her mother discussed killing Nickell by a
drug overdose or by hiring a hit man.
   Although prosecutors were unable to link Mrs. Nickell directly
to cyanide purchases, she was convicted of all five counts she
faced, two of causing death by tampering with a product involved in
interstate commerce and three of tampering.
   Beset by financial problems and unhappy in her marriage, Mrs.
Nickell laced Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules with cyanide and
gave them to her husband for a headache, prosecutors said.
   To make his death appear random, she poisoned other bottles of
Excedrin and Anacin capsules and put them on store shelves. Ms.
Snow died after swallowing capsules from one of those bottles, six
days after Nickell, the prosecution said.
   Her husband, Paul Webking, said she might still be alive if
local authorities had recognized the real cause of Nickell's death,
initially attributed to emphysema.
   ``The effect of the verdict is secondary to the fact that Sue is
dead,'' Webking said. ``No matter what the verdict is, Sue's going
to be dead.''
   ``I wish they'd hang her to the highest tree,'' said Ms. Snow's
mother, Marion Chapman, in a telephone interview from Artesia, N.M.
   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng said he would wait until
after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges.
   The deaths of Nickell and Ms. Snow touched off a nationwide
tampering scare and prompted Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to
recall its capsuled, non-prescription medicines.
   ``Product tampering is intolerable to society,'' John Weisberg,
spokesman for New York-based Bristol-Myers, said. ``When it occurs
every effort must be made to identify those responsible and to
bring them to justice,'' he said.
   Seven people died in Chicago in 1982 from cyanide-laced
Extra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved.
   Ms. Maida accused Mrs. Nickell of poisoning her husband to
collect on his life insurance. Hillier said Mrs. Nickell was the
victim of a lying daughter who stood to gain a $300,000 reward from
pharmaceutical companies for information leading to an arrest.
   Mrs. Nickell's plan failed because she was careless in mixing
the poisonous capsules, greedy for insurance benefits and owned two
of the five tainted bottles of painkillers recovered, Ms. Maida
said in closing arguments.
   Mrs. Nickell, a tropical fish enthusiast, used a bowl
contaminated with an algaeicide for cleaning fish tanks when she
mixed potassium cyanide with the Anacin and Excedrin painkillers,
the prosecution alleged.
   Traces of the compound were found in the five tainted bottles.
   Mrs. Nickell also lied about insurance policies and pressed
medical authorities for a more specific cause of death, Ms. Maida
said.
   Mrs. Nickell stood to receive $71,000 in insurance if the death
of her husband was from emphysema, as pathologists first concluded,
but could have gotten $176,000 if the death were ruled accidental,
the prosecutor said.
   Mrs. Nickell also left fingerprints on library books about
poisons and cyanide, Ms. Maida said.

   Appearing on television for the first time
to discuss his landmark cigarette liability lawsuit was a little
embarrassing for retired construction worker Antonio Cipollone. But
he got used to that.
   But things were different when a lawyer for one of the tobacco
company defendants started discussing the behavior of Cipollone's
wife, Rose, a 40-year smoker who died of lung cancer.
   ``It bothered me, and I felt like getting up and punching him in
the mouth,'' Cipollone said. ``But I kept cool and calm.''
   The soft-spoken, 64-year-old Italian immigrant wouldn't say what
statement he was referring to. Throughout the trial, attorneys for
the cigarette companies have focused on Mrs. Cipollone's behavior
to show she smoked of her own free will, despite repeated warnings
from her husband about the dangers.
   The angry statement was an exception for Cipollone, a mild man
given to sweater vests, kind smiles and friendly greetings in the
corridors of the federal courthouse in Newark.
   For four months, Cipollone has sat quietly and patiently behind
the plaintiff's table as a dozen attorneys battle over a case that
has become a cause celebre for anti-smoker forces and a concern for
the $22 billion tobacco industry.
   Mrs. Cipollone died in 1984 at age 58. Her husband's is the face
behind the heading ``Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., et al.,''
which has appeared atop dozens of court opinions, some of which
have established important precedents on procedural issues.
   Decisions in the case have passed through the U.S. Supreme
Court, appellate panels and state courts nationwide.
   The name Cipollone has been uttered on national television and
written on the pages of most major news publications.
   Despite his new place in the public light and American
jurisprudence, ``I did not change one bit. At all,'' Cipollone said
in a light accent of his native land during an interview last week.
``I'm still the same. I'll be the same the rest of my life.''
   The case is considered important because of the breadth of
internal tobacco company documents obtained by the plaintiffs, and
the possible public relations harm to an industry that has never
paid damages to someone suing it for making a product that
allegedly brought on disease and death.
   Cipollone charges three companies _ Liggett, Philip Morris Co.
and Lorillard Inc. _ are liable for his wife's illness by covering
up the dangers of smoking. The companies counter that she was an
intelligent woman who smoked because she wanted to, despite knowing
the dangers. They deny smoking causes lung cancer.
   Cipollone says he approaches his prominence with a sense of
responsibility. But if he should win, putting the Cipollone name
firmly in history?
   ``I would be proud that I did something,'' he said.
   ``The thing is, with this case, my wife started it and I pursued
the case. Because she told me, `In case anything should happen to
me, you should pursue the case.''
   The lawsuit was filed a year before Mrs. Cipollone died.
   A lifetime of hard work did not prepare Cipollone for what he is
doing now.
   ``I didn't have the slightest idea that this would take so
long,'' he said.
   Born in a small village in the countryside between Rome and
Naples on Aug. 31, 1923, Cipollone came to the United States at age
15 with his mother and two sisters. They lived in an Italian
section of New York City's East Harlem.
   He went to work in construction, helping build the 1939 World's
Fair grounds, United Nations and Floyd Bennett Field, a New York
airport.
   He met Rose at an outdoor opera in the neighborhood when she
asked him to move aside so she could see.
   After marrying, the couple moved to a larger apartment in the
Bronx, and then a house in Little Ferry, N.J. He worked for U.S.
Steel from 1960 to 1979, splicing cables used to lift loads of
steel. He had his own cable business from 1978 until retiring in
1986.
   When the case ends, which appears likely in late May or early
June, Cipollone plans to enjoy the end of his daily court visits.
   ``Believe me, for one week I'm going to stay home in the sun,''
he said.

<HEAD>Staley in Buyout Negotiations to Thwart British Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staley Contintental Inc. appears to
be seeking a ``white knight'' to avert a proposed takeover by
British sugar refiner Tate & Lyle PLC.
   Stley officials said Monday they were negotiating with at least
one other party interested in acquiring part or all of the company
based in this northwest Chicago surburb.
   David Satterfield, a Staley spokesman, would not identify the
parties.
   ``The significance here is that we've commenced negotiations,''
he said. ``There is a significant difference between discussions
and negotiations.''
   News of the negotiations confirmed reports last week that
Staley, the country's second-largest refiner of corn syrup and a
leading producer of food-service supplies, had discussed selling
all or part of the company to third parties.
   The company also said Monday it would continue to explore other
options to enhance shareholder values, including a financial
restructuring or recapitalization, a joint venture or a leveraged
buyout.
   Also Monday, Staley officials announced two favorable court
decisions upholding the validity of the company's
shareholder-rights plan and other measures taken to defend against
the Tate & Lyle takeover bid.
   The plan's validity was upheld by the Delaware Chancery Court,
they said, while the U.S. District Court in Delaware upheld the
constitutionality of the Delaware takeover statute as it applies to
Staley and Tate.
   Staley Continental chairman Donald E. Nordlund said he was
pleased with the court rulings denying Tate & Lyle's requests for
preliminary injunctions.
   ``The rights plan is obviously serving a useful purpose in
allowing the company to seek a more realistic offer,'' Nordlund
said.
   Industry analysts have mentioned Chicago-based Kraft Inc. as a
company that may have an interest in acquiring Staley's CFS
Continental Inc. food-service division. Staley defeated Kraft in a
bidding war for CFS Continental in October 1984.
   But several analysts contacted Monday refused to speculate on
which companies might be talking with Staley.
   ``I've seen the company's statement but I don't have any more
information on that myself,'' said Clinton Mayer III, an analyst in
New York with Bear Stearns Inc.
   ``Everything that can be said has been said,'' said Richard Elam
of Blunt Ellis & Loewi Inc. ``I'm just waiting for something to
occur that's concrete and palpable, and I don't know what it's
going to be.''
   Staley's board of directors last week advised the company's
shareholders to reject Tate & Lyle's second cash tender offer,
which totals about $1.42 billion, or $35 a share.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Staley
closed up 50 cents at $38.75 Monday.
   Analysts have said Staley has a fair market value of about $40 a
share.
   London-based Tate & Lyle, England's second-largest sugar
refiner, owns about 5 percent of Staley's stock and wants to
acquire the entire company for its A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners.
   Staley was based in Decatur, Ill., until about three years ago,
when it moved its headquarters to the Chicago suburbs.
   The British company has promised to move Staley's headquarters
back to Decatur if its takeover attempt succeeds.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
says it has asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to authorize
KCSI, and not the Denver Rio Grande Western Railway, to acquire and
operate the Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
   The application was based on the belief that it would be in the
best public interest for KCSI to own Southern Pacific, said Landon
Rowland, president and chief executive officer of KCSI, on Monday.
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation has been required by the
ICC to divest the Southern Pacific because a merger between it and
the Santa Fe Railway would have essentially ended railroad
competition in the Southwest and other markets served by the two
railroads, Rowland said.
   ``Santa Fe Southern Pacific chose to sell the Southern Pacific
to Denver Rio Grande, rather than to Kansas City Southern, for what
we believe to be purely anti-competitive reasons,'' he said.
   KCSI's operating plan, filed Monday with the ICC, calls for the
purchase of 547 modern locomotives over the next five years.
   ``In contrast, the Philip F. Anschutz interests, which control
the Denver Rio Grande, appear to treat the acquisition as primarily
a real estate play, and propose to buy only 40 new locomotives over
essentially the same period,'' he said.
   Samuel R. Freeman, the Rio Grande's vice president and general
counsel, said his company wouldn't neglect the Southern Pacific. It
would lease most new equipment instead of buying it to capitalize
on financial and tax benefits, Freeman said.
   The Rio Grande runs across about 1,900 miles, from Kansas City
to Utah. It hasn't revealed details for combining its small local
work force with that of the Southern Pacific, which has about 280
employees.
   Monday was the deadline for comments about the Southern
Pacific's proposed sale to be filed with regulators.
   Also opposing the deal were Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft and the
Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission.
   Freeman said the Rio Grande's purchase was backed by most
shippers, regulators and other railroads.
   The ICC expects to rule in mid-August on the sale plan.
   Regulators last June killed Santa Fe Southern Pacific's efforts
to merge the Southern Pacific with the Rio Grande Railway, which it
also owns. They feared that a merger of the two big lines, whose
tracks overlap in many areas, would stifle competition and increase
shipping rates.
   Early last year Kansas City Southern began a furious campaign to
buy the Southern Pacific. But the lobbying didn't prevent Santa Fe
Southern Pacific from naming the Rio Grande as the railroad's buyer
in late December.

<TEXT>
   McCormick & Co., the world's largest spice
maker, says it has reached an agreement with the Federal Trade
Commission allowing the company to proceed with its planned bid to
purchase a West Coast competitor.
   Legal obstacles stopping McCormick, based in Baltimore, from
acquiring the Spice Islands line of spices, herbs and vinegars from
Specialty Brands Inc., of San Francisco, for $56 million were
lifted under the agreement made with the FTC last week, McCormick
said Monday.
   A decision from the FTC, which reviews proposed mergers to
determind how they will affect market share, is expected later this
month.
   In April, a federal judge granted a request by the FTC to stop
the merger on the grounds that McCormick hadn't provided enough
information to the agency to determine how the deal would affect
competition in the $850 million spice and seasoning business.
   McCormick then filed a suit against the FTC in U.S. District
Court in Baltimore saying it had given the agency more than 120,000
pages of documents and depositions from top executives.
   McCormick spokesman Mac Barrett said the company has supplied an
additional 10,000 pages of documents.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Trade and Industry on Tuesday
cleared a 17.7 percent holding in Cadbury Schweppes PLC by General
Cinema Corp. of the United States.
   The clearance came in the form of a decision by the trade
department not to refer the holding to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
   However, the department's approval refers just to General
Cinema's current shareholding in Cadbury, a department spokeswoman
said.
   The matter could face further scrutiny by U.K. officials should
General Cinema increase its holding or make a full takeover bid for
Cadbury, said the spokeswoman, who was not identified in accordance
with British custom.
   Cadbury's share price bounded ahead 16 pence, or 30 cents, to
334 pence, or $6.28 per share by early afternoon on London's Stock
Exchange on the news.
   The Chestnut Hill, Mass.-based General Cinema, which has
interests in movie theaters and soft drink bottling, said late last
month that it planned to increase its stake in Cadbury Schweppes
and might try to acquire the British soft drink and candy maker.
   Chris Milburn, a director of investor relations at Cadbury, said
he was heartened by the fact that the government could still
initiate a monopolies panel investigation, but he said Tuesday's
news nevertheless came as a disappointment.
   Cadbury Chairman Sir Adrian Cadbury last week called for the
government to block foreign raids on the British confectionery
industry.
   Swiss foods giant Nestle S.A. has launched a $3.95 billion offer
for another British confectioner, Rowntree PLC, in which competing
suitor Jacobs Suchard S.A., another Swiss company, has built up a
29.9 percent stake.

<TEXT>
   The head of Pan American World Airway's Teamsters
union today demanded labor representatives on the company's board,
and threatened to strike if expired contracts are not signed.
   ``We can strike them at any time. We can strike them over
Memorial Day or the Fourth of July,'' warned William Genoese,
calling the date merely a matter of organization.
   Speaking before the carrier's annual shareholder's meeting here,
he said morale among the workers of New York-based Pan Am ``is at
an all-time low,'' with people ``leaving the company in droves.''
   The Teamsters represent more than 4,000 of Pan Am's 28,000
employees, chiefly reservations, clerical and cargo staff, and
their contract expired in February.
   Incoming President Thomas Plaskett was expected later today in
his first formal address to the company to appeal to employees to
save Pan Am. He was hired in January to steer the nation's
eighth-largest carrier back to profitability.
   He formerly worked at Continental Airlines under Texas Air Corp.
Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Genoese said Pan Am continues to lose money and will not regain
its financial health until it has signed contracts with all five
unions, allowing the company to borrow money to recapitalize.
   ``My objective is to try to move the company in the right
direction,'' said Genoese.
   He said he wants the company to sit down with all the unions
togehter to complete the contract talks, and wants union leaders to
serve on the board of directors.
   ``Their plan was to divide and conquer all the unions,'' but the
strategy failed, he said.
   The Teamsters had threatened to strike when its contract expired
in February, but held off.
   In the first quarter Pan Am reported a net loss of $83.3
million, after losing $93.6 million in the same period last year.
   For 1987 the company lost $262 million, compared to $462 million
in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Swiss car owners could be taxed on the
distance they travel each year as a new incentive for combating
pollution, government experts say.
   The idea was unveiled Monday in a government-ordered study of
possible alternatives to the current annual motor vehicle tax based
on engine size.
   Mileage could be monitored with special counters connected to
the axle costing about 300 Swiss francs, or $215, each, the report
by a panel of financial experts said. Sweden already uses such a
system for diesel vehicles.
   Similar Swiss measures are considered at least several years
away.
   For example, the report said, the owner of a family car in the
Zurich area currently pays a yearly vehicle tax equivalent to about
$330. Under a variable scale, the tax could be pegged to annual
travel of 12,800 kilometers, or 9,140 miles, the levy rising or
falling proportionally with the actual mileage.

   It took Ghanaian businesswoman
Esther A. Ocloo 30 years to pay off the bank debts for her food
processing plant, and with a little help she will be back in debt
very soon.
   Ocloo is hoping local banks in Ghana will approve a loan request
of $1,000 so she can expand her operation to fruit juices, jam and
canned fruit.
   She is one of dozens of African entrepreneurs trying to grow
with the help of the African Project Development Facility (APDF), a
year-old, $7.2 million operation sponsored by the African
Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the
United Nations to help smaller African businesses obtain
development financing.
   Scarcity is a fact of life in Africa, especially in terms of
money. For business people big or small, getting the money to turn
development ideas into reality is a major problem.
   The development project accepts applications from small
businesses with annual turnovers between $500,000 and $5 million
and ideas that have a chance for success. It helps them prepare
project feasibility studies for potential financiers. The service
is free of charge.
   For four years Kanga Ballou, an Ivorian businessman, had been
trying to get his hands on a million dollars to start West Africa's
first pencil factory. He is very near to realizing that dream.
   Three out of four local banks have approved loan requests
totaling $600,000. An APDF feasibility study convinced the bankers
of the profitability of Ballou's idea. He says he and his seven
partners can put up the rest of the funding.
   ``The problem with people like me is that we don't have the
money or knowledge to do these project proposals,'' Ballou said in
an interview in his Abidjan office. ``For years I approached these
banks by myself and I couldn't get an answer.''
   The reason, he added, was the banks could not afford the risk.
   Ballou wanted to use local wood to manufacture pencils for a
market supplied by more expensive Japanese and European imports.
The development project staff sent a wood sample to a European
manufacturer for quality tests, which were positive. This was
followed by a market study which discovered a healthy demand for
cheaper pencils manufactured in Africa, by Africans.
   Other West African entrepreneurs interviewed about the APDF's
work said the service helped fill a void left by the collapse of
African development banks in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   In Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer of cocoa and a
leading producer of coffee, the most obvious example of this
collapse is Credit de la Cote D'Ivoire, an important local bank,
which has suspended its credit operations for businesses. It was
set up during the boom days in one of Africa's strongest economies.
   Most African countries are encumbered by severe economic
restraints, including high foreign debts, falling prices for export
goods and devastating droughts, which have caused food shortages
and mass starvation around the continent.
   The job of business financing has been left to commercial banks,
which are not prepared to risk long-term financing on small
businesses, said Andre Cracco, manager of the APDF's West African
operations in Abidjan.
   ``They don't have the expertise and resources to appraise
projects,'' said Cracco. ``So they are careful. Maybe even too
careful.''
   Cracco and his colleagues do not contend the revival of small
businesses is the solution to Africa's economic problems. But it's
a start.
   ``What's really exciting here is that we have a group of
professionals ... who are sitting with African entrepreneurs and
looking at projects from the African point of view,'' said Makarand
Dehejia, a consultant to the APDF. ``The results have been quite
remarkable.''
   Eight businesses in Ivory Coast, Kenya, Botswana and Uganda have
successfully obtained nearly $13 million from national and European
creditors with the APDF's help. It is working with creditors on 21
other projects around Africa from regional offices in Abidjan and
the Kenyan capital of Nairobi.
   In 1987 the development project handled 600 applications,
accepting 10 percent. Cracco conceded many businesses were turned
away, but he stressed they were trying to help small businesses.
This has disqualified many applicants.
   The development project staff considers 10 percent to be normal
for the first year. Cracco said that after one year in operation
the APDF is in the ``takeoff stage,'' and will be in full operation
by December.
   ``Many people submit unbankable ideas,'' Cracco added. ``From
the word go we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the bankers.''
   Saliou Ndione, who owns Pechazur, a shrimp fishing and
processing company in Ivory Coast, said African businesses have a
credibility problem. He said few African businessmen have
experience and the mistakes many made after African nations became
independent have contributed to the continent's economic problems.
   Ndione is building a new factory with a bank loan of 160 million
West African francs ($560,000) he got with the help of the
development project. He wants to improve his product and broaden
his sales in Ivory Coast and in West Africa.
   Cracco said Ndione's original ideas for expansion were more
ambitious and risky, and could have cost a great deal of time and
money. The marketing study prepared by Cracco showed the market
probably wouldn't support a huge increase in output. Plans for the
new factory were tailored to the study's picture of market demand,
which impressed Ndione's creditors.
   ``The APDF's work was indispensable to us,'' Ndione said. ``The
bank took their study much more seriously than if we had done it
ourselves.''

<HEAD>High-Tech Video in California's Gold Country</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRASS VALLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remote hills of California's
gold country are far from the sprawling urban jungle of Silicon
Valley _ and that's just the way employees of the Grass Valley
Group like it.
   A high-tech company where almost everyone, including top
executives, wears jeans and sneakers, the Grass Valley Group has
been designing and manufacturing state-of-the art video production
equipment for almost 25 years.
   Nestled in the hills outside of town, GVG is by far the biggest
private employer in an area where jobs in lumber and light industry
can be hard to come by. A sleepy former gold-mining town with fewer
than 9,000 residents, the streets are lined with quaint Victorian
homes, some of which are opening as bed and breakfast-style inns.
An annual bluegrass festival attracts hordes of tourists.
   The views from GVG's international headquarters of wooded
hillsides, cows grazing and wide blue sky capture the feel of this
decidedly rural area, traversed by roads with names like Squirrel
Creek, Fawn Path and Lime Kiln Road.
   It is an unlikely spot for the design and manufacture of
technology that helps bring you everything from ``Monday Night
Football'' to the glitzy graphics on the nightly news.
   ``If a picture is worth a thousand words, we give you a picture
every sixteenth of a second,'' said Dan Wright, president of GVG, a
subsidiary of Tektronix Inc.
   GVG has built its reputation on editing units and production
switchers, the behind-the-scenes equipment that controls things
like which images go over the air during a live sportscast or when
one image ``wipes'' or fades to another.
   GVG is also a pioneer in the flashy video effects market. It's
GVG equipment that made the Olympics logo tumble across the screen
during coverage of the Winter Games in Calgary. Other popular
effects can warp an image or give it a three-dimensional look.
   Thanks to one gizmo, television viewers can watch
``split-screen'' action. Another, called a Kaleidescope, can
compress one of the split images so viewers can see an Olympic
skier at the top of a mountain while watching another zip for the
finish line. On the zanier side, one of GVG's standard products
enabled David Letterman to broadcast his late-night show
upside-down one night.
   And it was GVG wizardry that brought President Reagan's 1984
landslide victory to video life as state after state was
``painted'' into the president's corner.
   ``It wasn't too long ago you'd see the person turning the
numbers by hand,'' said Wright. ``Now it's all done with computers.
They'll just pack information into you now. They couldn't do that
10 years ago.''
   As their equipment has revolutionized what television looks
like, the company has introduced some innovations of its own.
   Located about 150 miles east of San Francisco, GVG has its own
airplane to fly customers in and out of the remote, wooded company
headquarters _ ``a plus and minus when it comes to recruitment,''
according to Executive Vice President Dave Mayfield.
   Designed to appeal to ``free-thinking'' employees (one company
executive ventured to call them ``mavericks''), flex-time schedules
are available for most of the nearly 1,000 workers in Grass Valley.
   Assemblers work in self-managed ``cells'' rather than production
lines, rotating jobs and setting their own production goals. As an
added incentive, a profit-sharing program was introduced in 1976.
   A fitness trail winds its way through the 330-acres of
campus-like grounds and fleets of bright turquoise company bicycles
are parked outside each of nine buildings to carry employees and
visitors about the grounds.
   Part of engineer Larry Click's job involves teaching customers
how to operate their new equipment, some of which looks so
complicated that it has appeared as spaceship interiors in ``Star
Wars'' and other Hollywood features.
   ``If a question comes up during a class and I don't know the
answer,'' Click said, ``I'll just go over to Building 9 where they
design the stuff and ask them.''
   That sort of attention to detail appears to have been a founding
philosophy of the Grass Valley Group, which was established in
1959. It's all part of what marketing manager Bob Johnson calls the
``culture'' of the company.
   Company lore has it that the founder, Dr. Donald G.C. Hare, was
such an avid environmentalist that he took a two-week vacation when
trees had to be felled to make way for a new building. He couldn't
bear to hear the sound of the saws.
   And if the habits of the free-thinkers at GVG sometimes border
on the eccentric, so much the better.
   One department is so adamantly unorthodox that if an outside
salesman makes a call wearing a necktie, he'll more than likely
lose it _ to a pair of scissors, according to Johnson.
   Although the company will not release earnings information,
officers will say they are in the midst of a 100-acre expansion of
their facilities in nearby Nevada City. Much of GVG's competition
comes from Japanese companies like Sony, JVC and Panasonic, but
Ampex Corporation of Redwood City is a major competitor.
   With their specialized equipment in television newsrooms and
video production houses across the country, GVG is now aiming
``lower in the marketplace,'' toward smaller video production
companies.
   As more companies turn to in-house videos for instruction and
promotional purposes, GVG plans scaled-down $10,000 models of their
premier $300,000 production switcher.
   ``Each new generation of equipment offers more capabilities for
less dollars,'' said Mayfield.

<HEAD>Former Guinness Director Loses Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Guinness PLC director lost an appeal
Tuesday of a court ruling that ordered him to repay a $9.8 million
fee he received for work during the company's 1986 takeover of
Distillers Co.
   Thomas Ward, a Washington, D.C., attorney, had sought to
overturn a 1987 High Court ruling that declared unlawful the work
agreement with former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders.
   The $9.8 million payment had been made without the approval of
the full Guiness board.
   In making its decision Tuesday, the three Appeals Court judges
also ordered Ward to pay Guinness' court costs and refused him the
option of appealing to the House of Lords, the last recourse for
appeals in the British legal system.
   Ward, who didn't attend the appeal hearing, had argued that any
duty to disclose his interest in the agreement was met by his
disclosure to a committee of directors consisting of Saunders,
former Guinness finance director Olivier Roux and himself.
   But the court ruled that Britain's Companies Act required
disclosure to a meeting of the directors and that the committee
didn't meet that qualification.
   Saunders and six other men currently face multiple charges
relating to alleged stock manipulation during the takeover of
Distillers, a gin and whisky maker.
   Ward has not been charged but British police have issued a
warrant for his arrest.
   Guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for
the repurchase of Guinness stock, apparently to boost the share
price and make Guinness' cash-and-stock offer more attractive than
a rival bid.

<HEAD>$40-Million Sale Of Clos Du Bois Wine Maker To Hiram Walker
Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whiskey distiller Hiram Walker of Canada has
agreed to buy California winemaker Clos Du Bois for about $40
million, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday.
   Neither company released details of the sale Monday, but an
unidentified source told the Times that Hiram Walker, a subsidiary
of British conglomerate Allied Lyons PLC, closed the deal in San
Francisco.
   Included in the sale were 540 acres of prime vineyard land in
Sonoma County, as well as Healdsburg-based Clos Du Bois' second
label, River Oaks.
   Clos Du Bois makes its wines at a leased facility in Healdsburg,
located about 50 miles north of San Francisco.
   ``The vineyard land is worth between $10 million and $12 million
by itself, so that makes the value of the brand pretty high,'' the
source told the Times. ``These days, that's the name of the game:
brand strength.''
   Last year, Clos Du Bois produced 204,000 cases of wine.

<HEAD>Warner to Buy Lorimar in $1.18 Billion Stock Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. and Lorimar
Telepictures Corp. said today they have agreed in principle for
Warner to acquire financially troubled Lorimar in a stock-swap
transaction worth about $1.18 billion.
   Under the agreement between entertainment conglomerate Warner
and Lorimar, a major television producer, 0.415 Warner common
shares would be exchanged for each Lorimar common share.
   The deal puts a value of about $14 on each of Lorimar's 47
million outstanding common shares, for a total of around $630
million. In addition, Warner would assume Lorimar's debt of about
$550 million.
   A merger between the two entertainment companies had been widely
expected, since they have been engaged in on-again-off-again merger
talks since early March.
   Several conditions are attached to the deal. For example,
Lorimar would be able to terminate the agreement if the average
price of Warner's common stock during the specified period before
the closing of the merger doesn't result in a price of at least $15
a share for Lorimar shareholders.
   In that event, and in certain other circumstances, Warner would
get a fee of $10 million from Lorimar.
   Lorimar earlier rejected a $770 million, or $17-a-share,
takeover bid from Denver investor Marvin Davis, the former owner of
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. Davis, who has indicated he may be
willing to go higher, wasn't immediately available for comment
today.
   Lorimar told Davis in mid-March that it would keep his offer in
mind, but Lorimar spokesman Ken Lerer said today the company had no
comment on whether that is still its position.
   Lorimar stock fell 12.5 cents to $13 a share in midday trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, while Warner declined 75 cents to
$32.87{.
   Another condition of the deal gives New York-based Warner an
option to purchase 18.5 percent of Lorimar common stock at $15 a
share. The option can be exercised if Lorimar accepts a higher
offer from a third party.
   The agreement requires the approval of each company's board of
directors, Lorimar shareholders and regulatory authorities. Under
the deal, Lorimar Chairman Merv Adelson would join Warner's board
as vice chairman.
   ``The acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures ... will expand
(Warner's) already broad base of leadership in the entertainment
industry,'' Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross said.
   Analysts have suggested that Lorimar's stock is worth between
$14 and $20 a share.
   Lorimar, based in Culver City, Calif., is a leading producer of
original television programming, but in recent years has been
troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into other areas
disintegrated _ sometimes causing the company to incur losses or
heavy costs that depressed its earnings.
   Lorimar produces such long-running TV series as ``Dallas,''
``Knots Landing,'' ``Peoples Court'' and ``Love Connection.'' It
has 12 hours a week of prime-time TV programming and 16{ hours of
syndicated programs.
   For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Lorimar
posted a net loss of $82.6 million on revenue of $616.8 million.
The loss included $45 million in writedowns on five movies and $22
million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video
subsidiary.
   The company has replaced managements of both its movie and
home-video units.
   In March, several Lorimar shareholders filed a class action
lawsuit against the company in federal court, alleging that Lorimar
overstated its income and net worth and did not reveal problems
with its home-video unit.
   Davis has been seeking to get back into the entertainment
industry since he sold Fox to media tycoon Rupert Murdoch in 1985
for $575 million. Davis had owned Fox for four years, but the
company was beset by persistent losses.
   Last year, Davis made an unsuccessful $321.9 million bid for the
90.6 percent he didn't already own of Spectradyne Inc., the
nation's largest supplier of cable television and pay-per-view
movies for hotels.

   Jane Amsterdam, a magazine and book editor, will
be the next editor of the New York Post, the newspaper's owner,
Peter S. Kalikow, announced Tuesday.
   Ms. Amsterdam will be the sixth woman at the editorial helm of
an American newspaper of greater than 100,000 circulation,
according to the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Ms. Amsterdam said she felt ``probably the way that filly felt
on Saturday,'' a reference to Winning Colors, the third female
horse ever to win the Kentucky Derby. ``I think it's great.''
   Ms. Amsterdam will join the newspaper officially on June 13 and
be listed as executive editor until the departure of the current
editor, Frank Devine, who is returning to Australia for personal
reasons by year's end, Kalikow's announcement said.
   Ms. Amsterdam was founding editor of Manhattan inc., a
business-oriented city magazine, in 1984, but left three years
later in a disagreement with the owner, D. Herbert Lipson.
   She joined the publishing house of Alfred A. Knopf as a senior
editor in January.
   Previous positions include deputy editor of investigations at
the Washington Post and assignment editor in the paper's style
section. Before that she was executive editor at The American
Lawyer, New York magazine, New Times magazine and the New Jersey
Monthly.

   Stock prices were holding steady at higher
levels after reports today that several major brokerages had
suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own accounts.
   The market was also taking a positive attitude toward the
Treasury's three-day auction of $26 billion in new bonds and notes,
set to begin this afternoon, analysts said.
   At noon, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at
2,007.79, up 10.44 points.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 693 up, 565 down and
532 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.95 million shares, down
considerably from the 103.6 million shares traded by noon on Monday.
   Many traders have been wondering how much Japanese participation
there will be in the auction, as well as what effect the new supply
will have on the credit markets, analysts said.
   ``Some investors are focusing on the fact that interest rates
already are high and that the refunding will go well,'' said
Hildegarde Zagorski, second vice president at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Separately, three of Wall Street's biggest investment houses _
Salomon Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. and PaineWebber Inc.
-announced that they had suspended index-arbitrage trading for
their own accounts.
   That gave the market a psychological lift, analysts said.
   ``It's a big plus because people are now realizing that
investors have been avoiding the market because of volatility,''
Zagorski said. Index arbitrage has been criticized as causing wide
swings in the market.

   The U.S. dollar closed lower against most major
foreign currencies in quiet European trading Tuesday. Gold prices
rose.
   Currency dealers said most activity focused on the British
pound, which continued to attract investor interest because of high
British interest rates.
   The U.S. dollar was pushed down after its failure to rise
through technical resistance levels in the past few trading
sessions and by a large order to sell dollars for Swiss francs,
London dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading as Europe's business day begins, the
dollar closed at 124.63 Japanese yen, down from Monday's 124.87
yen. In later London trading it was quoted at 124.45 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. The pound
rose to $1.8825 from $1.8790 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.6783 West German marks, down from 1.6820; 1.3955
Swiss francs, down from 1.4010; 5.6905 French francs, down from
5.7075; 1.8815 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8805; 1,248.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,250.00; and 1.2375 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2396.
   Gold rose in quiet trading in Europe on Tuesday, closing at a
bid $446.50 a troy ounce in both London and Zurich. The metal
closed at a bid price of $444 a troy ounce in London on Monday and
at $445 an ounce in Zurich.
   Earlier, gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid $448.95 a troy ounce,
up from $446.66.
   Silver rose on the London market to a late bid price of $6.45 a
troy ounce, compared with Monday's $6.43.

   Somalia on Tuesday was added to the list of
countries which may no longer borrow from the International
Monetary Fund because of overdue repayments on previous loans.
   The northeast African republic owes the fund about $37 million.
   Other countries on the list are Vietnam, Liberia, Peru, Sierra
Leone, Guyana, Sudan and Zambia.
   The World Bank, owned by the same 151 countries as the fund, has
a similar list.
   Payments from the countries on it are so far behind that the
bank is no longer entering payments from them on its books until it
actually receives the money. Banks sometimes list payments to them
on an ``accrual'' basis just because they are due, regardless of
whether the money has actually come in.
   Peru, Zambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guyana are on this list
as well as the IMF list. The bank also includes Nicaragua, Syria
and _ since last week _ Panama.
   The bank keeps a list of countries, not normally published,
whose payments are 75 days overdue. Its practice is to suspend
disbursements on loans to those countries. Sheldon Rappaport, a
spokesman for the bank, said that at the moment its two lists are
identical.
   The bank is the chief source of long-term aid loans to Third
World countries. The fund's basic job is to keep currencies stable,
often with the help of shorter-term loans. In recent years its
loans too have been going almost entirely to Third World countries.

   Stock prices closed slightly lower Tuesday but
finished at their best level after attempting to follow Wall Street
higher.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index dropped 2.3
points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,792.6, its highest level for the
session. The index had moved down as much as 12.5 points in early
trading.
   Volume was a moderate 397.5 million shares, compared with
Monday's 360.0 million shares.
   After opening lower, the market attempted to rally on news that
the British government wouldn't launch a monopoly probe into the
17.7 percent stake held by General Cinema Corp., based in Chestnut
Hill, Ma., in the British food and drink giant Cadbury Schweppes
PLC.
   The clearance came in the form of a decision by the Department
of Trade and Industry that it wouldn't refer the General Cinema
holding to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   Cadbury's shares finished up 18 pence, or about 34 cents, to 336
pence, or about $6.32.
   Dealers said the London market also was helped somewhat by New
York's stronger opening and an announcement from several U.S.
brokerage firms that they would suspend index-arbitrage program
trading.

   The stock market was going nowhere in early
afternoon trading today, torn between worries about interest rates
and this week's Treasury auction and positive news that several
major brokerages had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their
own accounts, analysts said.
   At 2 p.m., the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at

   Thomas Czech, research director at the Milwaukee securities firm

   On the negative side, he said, were minor weakness in the dollar

   But on the positive side, he said, was today's announcement by

<HEAD>Daiwa Launches $2.5 Billion U.S. Mutual Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daiwa Securities Co. of Japan has launched a
$2.5 billion mutual fund that will invest in U.S. Treasuries and
corporate bonds, setting a record for a new fund investing in the
United States, a report published Tuesday said.
   The Wall Street Journal, in Tuesday's editions, said the new
fund could indicate that Japanese investors have revived their
enthusiasm for U.S. bonds. Most of the investors in the fund are
Japanese financial institutions, along with some individuals.
   Daiwa officials told the Journal that the fund, called New Bond
Fund 88, was opened to participation last Friday and attracted so
many investors that it was oversubscribed and had to be closed on
Monday.
   Officials of the Japanese investment firm didn't return
telephone calls Tuesday seeking confirmation of the fund launch.
   The record amount to be invested by the Daiwa fund surpasses the
$2 billion MFS Intermediate Income Trust, the largest comparable
U.S. fund, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld, a specialist in mutual
funds. The MFS fund, launched in early March, also invests in U.S.
government and corporate bonds.
   Japanese investors were likely attracted to the Daiwa fund by
the current higher yields on U.S. bonds compared with their
Japanese counterparts. U.S. Treasuries are currently yielding rates
of more than 9 percent, while Japanese government and corporate
bonds yield around 4{ percent.
   Chris Ohmura, an executive vice president of Daiwa, told the
Journal the new fund will seek even higher yields for investors by
purchasing U.S. company bonds, though it won't buy high-yield,
high-risk corporate ``junk'' bonds.
   The new fund may do some buying at the Treasury's quarterly
refinancing auctions being held this week, most likely in
shorter-term issues, Ohmura said.

<BYLINE>Britain in a Lather Over Foreign Investment</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain is in a lather over foreign stake-building
in some of its largest companies and is hinting at moves to block
incursions into British Petroleum Co. PLC and two big confectioners.
   While the rumblings echo familiar patriotic strains, the
government says its concerns are strategic, not protectionist.
   The BP case, for example, involves the purchase of a major stake
in the company by an OPEC member, which could put the interests of
British shareholders at risk, the critics say.
   They argue that the foreign raids on candy makers Rowntree and
Cadbury Schweppes are even more of a mismatch because the raiders
themselves are protected against takeover reprisals.
   In the BP case, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
said the Kuwaiti government's acquisition of a 22 percent stake in
the oil giant warranted investigation because the Arab nation
belongs to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Britain, the world's fifth largest oil producer, is not a member
of the cartel.
   The Conservative government has referred the matter to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to determine whether the
acquisition is in the public interest, according to Trade Secretary
Lord Young.
   The Kuwaiti government's investment office in London maintains
that its BP stake is a long-term investment, and ``considers it has
always acted as a model investor in BP.''
   It bought the stake piecemeal after the British government sold
off its remaining 31.5 perent share of BP last fall.
   Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading, which advises the trade
secretary on whether to call in the monopolies commission, is
reviewing two Swiss companies' runs on Kit Kat-maker Rowntree PLC.
   Noting that Swiss law protects Nestle S.A. and Jacobs Suchard
S.A. from takeovers, critics object to the lack of reciprocity.
   Kenneth Clarke, secretary of state for trade and industry, said
in response to a question in the House of Commons on Tuesday that
reciprocity would be a key issue in the review.
   ``The points (being) made about fairness are crucial,'' Clarke
said.
   John Banham, director general of the Confederation of British
Industry, Britain's largest industry group, added: ``We can't
safely continue to play football against teams which have built
brick walls against their own goals and expect to win.''
   Swiss food giant Nestle has launched a $2.1 billion pound ($3.95
billion) takeover offer for Rowntree and has bought an 11 percent
stake in the company. Jacobs Suchard has purchased a 29.9 percent
holding in Rowntree, the maximum allowed under British takeover
regulations short of a full takeover bid.
   Also at issue is General Cinema Corp.'s purchase of a 17.7
percent stake in Cadbury Schweppes PLC. The goverment said Tuesday
it would not go to the monopolies commission, but warned that
Chestnut Hill, Mass.-based General Cinema could face further
scrutiny if it goes ahead with plans to increase its stake.
   Critics complain that General Cinema also is ``bid-proof''
because some of its shareholders have limited voting rights and the
state of Delaware, where the company is incorporated, has passed
anti-takeover legislation.
   Young denied the government was becoming protectionist, telling
the Observer newspaper: ``If we start getting into protectionism,
we will be the ones to suffer most.''
   While Mrs. Thatcher is a staunch advocate of free market
policies and Britain is an enthusiastic foreign investor, it
remains generally resistant to foreign investment.
   ``This company is a national asset,'' former Rowntree Chairman
Sir Donald Barron told applauding shareholders at their annual
meeting late last month. ``It is wrong that it should go to some
inanimate place without tradition.''
   Nestle Chairman Helmut Maucher came to London this week to meet
with members of Parliament, insisting Rowntree would benefit if its
products were marketed through Nestle's worldwide sales network.
   Asked by Independent Television News about the reciprocity
issue, he admitted that it was ``a barrier to takeover.''
   Walter Anderau, a Jacobs Suchard vice president, declined to
comment Tuesday.
   The foreign suitors do have backers in Britain. Some workers at
Rowntree said they believed Nestle offered better job security, and
the conservative Daily Telegraph saw ``no economic justification
for erecting barriers against foreign ownership of British
companies. And it would be unwise to try and do so at a time when
Britain is taking advantage of a cheap dollar to build up
substantial investments across the Atlantic.''
   On Tuesday, Labor party member Doug Hoyle introduced a proposal
which would give employees the right to consultation by their
employer before a takeover. But the bill stands little chance of
becoming law because of pressure on parliamentary time.

<HEAD>IMF's Camdessus Criticizes Banks For Lack Of Lending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund's managing
director criticized commercial banks Tuesday for not lending enough
to Third World nations.
   Michel Camdessus, addressing the City University Business School
in London, said developing countries needed new loans to grow out
of their debts.
   He said the IMF doesn't have the resources to provide such
loans, and although larger commercial banks do, they haven't shown
enough willingnes to extend new credit.
   ``The record is plain. Last year, net bank lending to countries
with debt-servicing problems was negligible at best; two years
before, it was negative,'' Camdessus said.
   ``It isn't only the amount of financing that matters. It is also
the timeliness of financing and the attitude of the banks in
responding to the indebted countries' efforts and needs.''
   He added: ``This inevitably sends the wrong signal to countries
contemplating bolder efforts and it calls into question the notion
that our strategy is a cooperative one oriented to growth.''
   Camdessus noted that many indebted countries have made progress
in adopting IMF-agreed programs, but the former governor of the
French central bank said the shift toward economic reform in the
developing world ``risks being interrupted, and even reversed,
because of doubts concerning the availability of financial
support.''
   IMF programs usually involve trimming government spending and
reducing the size of the public sector, loosening exchange rate and
trade policy and encouraging export-led growth.
   Camdessus' criticism of the conduct of commercial banks, which
are carrying billions of dollars worth of possible bad debts,
follows a sharper attack two weeks ago from David Mulford,
assistant U.S. Treasury secretary.
   Mulford said the banks had taken a passive approach to debt
crisis and he said that all major innovations for resolving the
crisis had come from the debtor countries themselves.
   Commercial bankers have criticized the IMF and many governments
for refusing to grant easier repayment terms on their own loans to
developing countries, but have expected banks to take losses on
their lending.

   The stock market turned lower in afternoon
trading today, giving up earlier gains on news that several major
brokerages had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own
accounts.
   At 3 p.m., the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at
1,995.69, down 1.66 points.
   Decliners outnumbered gainers by more than 7 to 6 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 784 down, 626
up, and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 107.51 million shares.
   Thomas Czech, research director at the Milwaukee securities firm
of Blunt Ellis & Loewi, said lower bond prices and a weaker dollar
were helping to undermine the stock market, which was already
nervously watching the start of the Treasury's three-day auction of
$26 billion in new bonds and notes.
   Traders have been worried that insufficient Japanese
participation might add to recent upward pressure on interest rates.
   Those concerns apparently outweighed today's positive news:
announcement by several of Wall Street's biggest investment houses
that they had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own
accounts.
   The brokerages were Salomon Brothers Inc.; Morgan Stanley & Co;
Bear Stearns & Co.; Kidder Peabody & Co. and PaineWebber Inc.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, second vice president at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., called those moves ``a big plus,'' because it
showed that industry leaders were ``realizing that investors have
been avoiding the market because of volatility,''
   Index arbitrage has been criticized as causing wide swings in
the market.

   Soybean futures closed sharply higher Tuesday
while grain futures turned mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The rise in soybean prices indicated traders remained strongly
bullish heading into a series of important Agriculture Department
reports that were to be released after the close, analysts said.
   Among the reports, the most eagerly awaited figure was the
USDA's new prediction for the size of the U.S. soybean stockpile on
Aug. 31, the end of the soybean crop year.
   The market was expecting the soybean number to be equal to or
slightly lower than the USDA's last estimate of 290 million
bushels. A figure lower than expected would give the soybean market
impetus to move higher, analysts said.
   In its report, the USDA predicted the stockpile would total 275
million bushels.
   Also released after the close were the USDA's estimate of the
1988 winter wheat crop _ 1.62 billion bushels vs. 1.56 billion
bushels produced last year _ along with supply-and-demand
indications for feed grains and the first estimate of next year's
grain stockpiles.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 2} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.03{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to
1 cent lower with May at $1.99{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3{

<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. is in dismal financial condition and
must get concessions from its labor unions before it can be pulled
out of a financial tailspin, new Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett
told shareholders Tuesday at the airline's annual meeting.
   A Teamsters union leader warned, meanwhile, that Pan Am will
face a strike if no contract settlement is reached soon between the
union and the airline.
   ``We have urgent problems to solve. We've been held in
suspension pending the finalization of new (contract) arrangements
with our union-represented employees,'' Plaskett said. ``That is
the first step on our road to recovery.''
   Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, operates Pan
American World Airways, a Northeast shuttle service and a commuter
airline.
   Plaskett, a former head of Continental Airlines who came to Pan
Am in January as part of a major management shakeup at Pan Am,
outlined his strategy to stanch financial losses in the immediate
future.
   He called for expanding the carrier's existing transatlantic and
Latin American routes and beefing up domestic routes so they feed
more passengers to Pan Am's international flights.
   Plaskett stressed wage cuts and other labor concessions he said
Pan Am must get from the Teamsters, the flight attendants union and
the Transport Workers union.
   The company has won $75 million in concessions from the two
unions representing pilots and flight engineers, Plaskett said.
   Since the Teamsters' contract expired Feb. 21, Pan Am has
imposed terms on the Teamsters designed to save $35 million
annually by cutting wages 8 percent and boosting productivity. Pan
Am also is asking for $27 million in annual savings from the
Transport Workers union, which represents mechanics and baggage
handlers, and $31 million from the flight attendants.
   In return for the concessions, the company is offering $21
million in Pan Am stock, with an additional 15 million shares to be
issued to employees if specific profit targets are reached. Pan Am
stock traded Tuesday at $2.75 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Pan Am, which has debts of around $500 million, posted a net
loss of $262 million last year and $462 million in 1986.
   In the first quarter of this year the company reported a net
loss of $83.3 million, narrowed from a loss of $93.6 million in the
same period last year.
   Plaskett was sharply criticized by William Genoese, director of
the national Teamsters union's Airline Division.
   At a news conference before the shareholders meeting, Genoese
threatened that the Teamsters would strike the airline if a fair
agreement was not signed soon.
   ``We can strike them at any time. We can strike them over
Memorial Day or the Fourth of July,'' Genoese warned, calling the
date merely a matter of organization.
   The Teamsters represent more than 4,000 reservations clerks and
other ground personnel. Pan Am has a total of around 28,000
employees.
   Pan Am continues to lose money and will not regain its financial
health until it has signed contracts with all five unions, allowing
the company to borrow money to recapitalize, Genoese said.

<DATELINE>BROOKFIELD, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RTE Corp.'s directors have approved a
$324 takeover offer from the Houston-based electrical firm Cooper
Industries Inc., which outbid a rival suitor.
   Cooper will begin a $45-a-share tender offer for RTE's 7.2
million outstanding shares on Friday, said RTE treasurer Douglas W.
Haag. Cooper also will assume outstanding RTE debt of about $41
million.
   RTE directors voted unanimously Monday to accept the Texas
company's offer, in a move that effecively thwarts a bid from Mark
IV Industries Inc. of West Amherst, N.Y.
   Mark IV initially offered to acquire RTE for $33 a share, but
then sweetened its offer to $36 a share, or about $259 million. Sal
Alfiero, president of the aerospace and defense firm, declined
comment Monday on whether Mark IV would increase its bid.
   Brookfield-based RTE makes electrical equipment for residential,
commercial and industrial users and employs about 3,300 nationwide.
   Cooper reported sales of $3.6 billion in 1987. The company
competes with RTE's line of electric transformers through its
McGraw-Edison subsidiary.

   The stock market closed mixed today, failing to
deliver a strong positive response to news that several major
brokerages had suspended index-arbitrage trading for their own
accounts.
   Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the overall market
moved moderately higher early in the session, only to shift into a
gradual retreat before turning back upward just before the close.
   Jack Baker, head of block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said the late bounce was due to some simple last-minute buy
orders, not index arbitrage trading.
   Analysts said the the rally's failure reflected the market's
strong underlying bearishness.
   Salomon Brothers Inc.; Morgan Stanley & Co; Bear Stearns & Co.;
Kidder Peabody & Co. and PaineWebber Inc. all issued announcements
saying they planned to stop index arbitrage trading for their own
accounts _ or had recently done so.
   Index arbitrage has been criticized as causing wide swings in
the market, scaring investors away and contributing to the market's
inability to respond positively to favorable news about the economy.
   Meanwhile, traders have been focusing on negative factors,
particularly recent signs of accelerating inflation.
   In particular, some analysts cited fears that interest rates
might jump higher amid limited Japanese participation the
Treasury's three-day auction of $26 billion in new bonds and notes,
which started today.
   But in fact, the bond market showed little response.

<TEXT>
   The federal courts have upheld Delaware's
takeover law for the second time in recent weeks, further
bolstering the ability of target companies to keep unwanted bidders
at bay.
   But because the judges' opinions were issued in preliminary
hearings and are subject to further consideration, experts expect
the law to be tested further.
   ``An appeal is almost guaranteed,'' said Robert Heim, a partner
in the Philadelphia office of Dechert Price & Rhoads. ``This is far
from being conclusive.''
   A number of states have enacted anti-takeover laws in recent
years, but Delaware's is regarded as especially significant because
many of the nation's biggest companies are incorporated there.
   Some 45 percent of the companies listed on the New York Stock
Exchange are incorporated in the state, and 56 percent of the
Fortune 500 industrial companies have opted to incorporate in
Delaware to take advantage of its liberal corporate and tax laws.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Jane Roth upheld Delaware's
3-month-old law as it applies to Tate & Lyle PLC's hostile $1.42
billion bid for Staley Continental Inc.
   And last month Judge Murray M. Schwartz said the law was ``most
likely constitutional.'' His ruling came in reponse to a challenge
by BNS Inc., a takeover company headed by British industrialist
Brian Beazer, which is pursuing a hostile $1.69 billion bid for
Koppers Co.
   Both Tate & Lyle and BNS argued that the Delaware law is
unconstitutional because, they say, it conflicts somewhat with
federal laws that govern tender offers and takeovers.
   Two previous challenges to the statute _ involving Campeau
Corp., which was attempting to acquire Federated Department Stores
Inc., and Black & Decker Corp. in its bid for American Standard
Inc. _ never got to the review stage.
   A key provision of the Delaware law bars a potential buyer from
acquiring a company for three years after the buyer accumulates
more than 15 percent of the target company's stock. The provision
does not apply if the buyer acquires a total of 85 percent of the
company's shares in the same transaction that it passes the 15
percent threshold, or if the board of directors supports the offer.
   The provision is aimed at ``bust-up'' deals in which a hostile
buyer sells off chunks of a target company in order to help finance
the buyout, and partial offers under which the buyer acquires just
enough shares to win control of the target and offers the remaining
shareholders a lesser price for their stock.
   Tate & Lyle's challenge was backed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which filed a brief in support of the British
firm's motion.
   Some experts say the SEC's willingness to formally register its
opposition to the law makes Roth's ruling particularly important.
   ``It is quite significant because it shows that a federal court
in charge principally of interpreting the constitution approved a
state statute under attack by ... the SEC,'' said Charles Crompton,
an attorney with Potter Anderson & Corroon in Wilmington.
   Crompton, who represented both Koppers and Staley, noted that
the SEC's involvement was highly unusual and that the court likely
would ``pay special attention to the position of a federal agency.''
   But others say that the SEC's support, filed in a
friend-of-the-court brief, bolsters Tate & Lyle's position so much
that an appeal is inevitable, even though the company has yet to
announce its intentions.
   ``Here's a federal agency that comes in and says the law runs
counter to the prinicples of the Williams Act (which governs tender
offers) because it gives management too much power and therefore
denies shareholders the ability to make an informed decision,''
Heim said. ``It is certain to be reviewed.''
   While experts agree that the Delaware statute is the most
comprehensive and best crafted of the state statutes, federal
judges in other circuits are not bound by the rulings of district
judges in Delaware.
   ``Lawyers and interested parties and shareholders are going to
be looking at what the courts of appeal do,'' Heim noted.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. on Tuesday reported a 1.4
percent decline in its first-quarter profit from a year earlier,
due to substantial costs stemming from its fight against a $2.33
billion tender offer from appliance maker Black & Decker Corp.
   The plumbing and air-conditioning manufacturer said its
first-quarter net income slipped to $21.3 million from $21.6
million in the first three months of 1987. Per-share income rose,
on the other hand, to 67 cents from 65 cents as the number of
outstanding American Standard shares declined to around 31.5
million from 32.9 million in the same period a year ago.
   The decline in net income occurred despite a 15.5 percent jump
in first-quarter revenue, to $900.8 million from $779.7 million a
year earlier.
   The company said it spent $30 million in investment banking,
legal and other fees fighting off the bid from Towson, Md.-based
Black & Decker. The appliance maker's final tender offer amounted
to $73 a share, or about $2.33 billion.
   Instead, New York-based American Standard agreed in March to a
leveraged buyout worth $78 a share, or $2.5 billion, by investment
banking firm Kelso & Co. In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer
finances the purchase of the target company with sales of its
assets or from its cash flow.

from $447.30 late Monday and $443.25 last Friday.
   Traders continued to focus on the British pound because it was
the only currency that did not seem to be locked into a narrow
trading range. Investors have been attracted to sterling because of
high British interest rates.
   The dollar maintained its ground after a Treasury Department
auction of three-year notes proceeded about as predicted.
   ``It was exceptionally lackluster,'' said Garrett Glass, vice
president for foreign exchange at First National Bank of Chicago.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 124.63 Japanese yen, down from Monday's 124.87
yen. In London trading, it was quoted at 124.45 yen. At the end of
the trading day in New York, the dollar closed at 124.38 yen, down
from 124.81 late Monday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. The pound
rose to $1.8825 from $1.8790 late Monday. Later in New York, the
pound rose to $1.8843 from $1.8815 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.6780 West German marks, down from 1.6815; 1.3944
Swiss francs, down from 1.4001; 1.2380 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2385; 5.6905 French francs, down from 5.7060; and 1,247.35
Italian lire, down from 1,249.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's rates:
1.6783 West German marks, down from 1.6820; 1.3955 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4010; 5.6905 French francs, down from 5.7075; 1.8815
Dutch guilders, up from 1.8805; 1,248.00 Italian lire, down from
1,250.00; and 1.2375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2396.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at a bid $448.95 a troy ounce, up from
$446.66 an ounce.
   Gold rose in quiet trading in Europe, closing at a bid $446.50 a
troy ounce in both London and Zurich. Gold closed at a bid price of
$444 a troy ounce in London on Monday and at $445 an ounce in
Zurich.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was bid at $450.10 an ounce, up from $447.30 late Monday.
   Silver rose on the London market to a late bid price of $6.45 a
troy ounce, compared with Monday's $6.43. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery was bid at $6.57 an ounce, up
from $6.47.

<HEAD>Five Big Brokers Abstain From Using Program Trading</HEAD>

   Five of the biggest brokerage firms said Tuesday
they had indefinitely halted a computerized trading strategy that
critics blame for spasms of destructive volatility in the
crash-scarred stock market.
   The announcements by Bear Stearns & Co., Kidder Peabody & Co.,
Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc.
marked the most aggressive voluntary step yet to calm an outcry
over index arbitrage program trading.
   ``It is necessary for all to work toward the goal of restoring
confidence in and guaranteeing the vibrancy of the marketplace,''
John Gutfreund, chairman and chief executive of Salomon, said in a
statement that reflected a view expressed by the others as well.
   Wall Street sources said these firms have been under enormous
pressure, both from stock exchanges and their own customers, for
coordinated action to control the computerized practice, which
while profitable for the firms has chased many investors out of the
market.
   Kidder, Morgan, PaineWebber and Salomon said they had suspended
index arbitrage program trading for their own accounts, although
they would continue to use the strategy for customers if asked.
Bear Stearns said it had suspended index arbitrage for its own
account and customers as of late last week.

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary Says U.S. Firms Should Avoid Soviet
Launches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies should avoid the lure of cheap
Soviet launches to send commercial payloads into space because of
danger to U.S. national security, Transportation Secretary Jim
Burnley told a meeting of space writers Tuesday.
   Burnley said the Soviet Union is launching 10 times as many
spaceloads as the United States annually but the U.S. government
wants to bridge the gap, which widened after America's commercial
program came to a halt following the 1986 explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle.
   ``The Soviets are taking clever advantage of our space-launch
hiatus, luring firms with their government-financed launchings,''
Burnley said at the 50th Aviation-Space Writers Association
conference.
   ``I am opposed to allowing any U.S. firm to use a Soviet
launcher, regardless of whether the threat of technology transfer
is posed,'' he said.
   The Soviets, who sent the first satellite into orbit in 1957,
have launched the most satellites into space of any country. The
Soviets' powerful booster rockets also can put into orbit heavier
payloads than their Western competitors.
   In March, the Soviet Union said it launched its first payload
for a paying customer, India. A month earlier, a Massachusetts
firm, Payload Systems Inc., became the first U.S. company to
receive authorization to send an experiment aboard a Soviet
spacecraft.
   The U.S. Commerce and State Departments approved a two-year
agreement starting in 1989 to have Soviet cosmonauts aboard the MIR
space station perform protein crystallization experiments for
Payload Systems' clients.
   Under the 1984 Commercial Space Launch Act, the U.S.
Transporation Department defines and regulates commercial space
efforts. In 1986, the Reagan administration announced that the
space shuttle would no longer carry commercial or foreign
satellites, except for defense-related missions.
   The directive was designed to foster competition among private
launchers, and Burnley said American companies have contracted to
launch 14 satellites, with reservations for 17 more. Eleven of the
contracts are from foreign governments or international
organizations.
   Meantime, though, the Soviet Union is seeking more U.S.
payloads, Burnley said.
   ``I perceive a danger to our national security in the Soviet
enticement of launch contracts with their artificially low
prices,'' he said. ``American companies are looking for inexpensive
rides for their payloads.
   ``If we ever allowed the American use of Soviet launchers to
become a pattern, the Soviets' already mature launch capability
would be further strengthened while our launch facilities could lie
rotting on the ground.''
   Burnley said he opposed the government's approval of Payload
Systems' Soviet contract because ``paying the Soviet Union with
U.S. hard currency to help them build a launch capacity that could
be used against us our allies in wartime is unwise.''

   Stock prices closed slightly higher Tuesday,
little affected by news that several major brokerages had suspended
index-arbitrage trading for their own accounts in attempt to curb
volatility and woo frightened investors back to the market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials settled at 2,003.65, up
6.30 points.
   Gainers edged out decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, with
745 up, 713 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 131.2 million shares, compared
with 166.32 million on Monday.
   The session started off with moderate gains, after the first of
what grew to five brokerages announced that they were suspending
index-arbitrage trading, or had recently done so.
   Index arbitrage takes place when traders using computers play
off differences between futures contracts and their underlying
baskets of stocks.
   It has been criticized as causing wide swings in the market,
scaring investors away and contributing to the market's recent
inability to respond positively to favorable news about the economy.
   Analysts said the moves _ by Salomon Brothers Inc.; Morgan
Stanley & Co; Bear Stearns & Co.; Kidder Peabody & Co. and
PaineWebber Inc. _ could have been sufficient to spark a strong
updraft, had the will been there.
   But apparently, it wasn't.
   By early afternoon, the rally was eroding away, and had turned
to an overall loss with less than an hour to go. Only a last-minute
spate of ordinary buy orders turned the tide, said Jack Baker, head
of block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``If the market really had a chance to go up, this should have
been a real opportunity for the bulls to shake, rattle and roll,''
said Alfred E. Goldman, a vice president at the A.G. Edwards & Sons
Inc. in St. Louis. ``But the rally was less than puny _ from minus
2 points in the Dow to 13 on the upside.
   ``What it says is, the overall trend is down.'' he added.
   Eugene Peroni, director of technical research, at the Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. securities firm in Philadelphia, said he
belived the market was ``still floundering.''
   ``It has no focal point. Most investors are very insecure.
There's no confidence. The sentiment is very bearish. There's
nothing there to trigger a rally,'' he said.
   Contributing to the market's bearishness is an underlying fear
of higher interest rates, brought on by recent signs of strength in
the economy.
   Some analysts said traders were nervously watching Tuesday's
start of the Treasury's three-day auction of $26 billion in new
bonds and notes, fearing that limited Japanese participation might
send rates higher amid slack demand.
   In Tuesday's auction, yields on three-year Treasury notes did
rise to the highest level since November, averaging 8.23 percent,
up from 7.42 percent at the last auction on Feb. 1.
   But Goldman said the performance proved to be ``no big deal''
compared to the market's underlying overall bearishness in
affecting Tuesday's performance.
   Among most-active issues on the Big Board, Woolworth fell 1[ to
54; Gillette was down } at 36} and IBM was up ] at 110~.
   Exxon was up { at 44[, while Texaco was unchanged at 50{.
   Among other NYSE-listed issues, First Boston gained 2| to 30~ on
word that it is discussing forming an international investment firm
with Credit Suisse.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 151.72 million shares.
   The NYSE index was up 0.47 at 145.75.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.08 to 299.66,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was 1.08 higher at 257.62.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.18
to 299.81. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 375.43, down 0.84.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $5.581 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.

<HEAD>Experts Predict More Delays If No New Airports Are Built</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With airline traffic on the rise, the nation needs
to build more airports, hire more traffic controllers and modernize
equipment to avoid ``hellish delays,'' airline industry officials
said Tuesday.
   ``In the heavily traveled corridors and the heavily traveled
airports, the system is becoming incapable of handling the
traffic,'' said Daniel M. Kasper, director of transportation at
Harbridge House Inc., a Boston consulting firm.
   ``Over the next three years I think we are going to see some
hellish delays developing,'' Kasper said in a panel discussion at
the 50th annual Aviation-Space Writers Association conference.
   Airline travel has been on the rise since the industry was
deregulated in 1978. According to Federal Aviation Administration
figures, 450 million people rode regularly scheduled commercial
airline flights last year, and officials project 600 million
passengers a year by the early 1990s.
   ``We've just got to get more capacity to handle the load,'' said
Stephen D. Hayes, a vice president of the Air Transport Assocation
of America.
   ``The long-term prospects are not good unless we can
significantly increase airport capacity in the country,'' he said.
``We have had explosive growth in air transportation in recent
years but the capacity of the system has not grown.''
   The number of public-use airports in the country fell for the
15th straight year in 1987 to 5,723 from 5,775 the previous year,
Hayes said.
   The last major airport built in the United States was
Dallas-Fort Worth International in 1974, and Denver is the only
city currently planning to build a new airport.
   Part of the problem has been local opposition to new airports
because of airplane noise, air pollution and ground traffic. In
some cities, residents have succeeded in forcing airports to reduce
operting hours and restrict the types of airplanes permitted to
land, experts said.
   ``Nobody wants an airport in his or her backyard,'' Kasper said,
adding that airlines have been forced to tailor their schedules to
meet local desires.
   Defending airlines' current on-time performance, Hayes said 78.8
percent of flights on the 14 largest American carriers were on time
in March, up from 74.7 percent a month earlier.
   He said consumer complaints fell 21 percent in April from the
previous month and that mishandled baggage declined to 7.5 reports
per 1,000 passengers in March, compared to 8.7 in February and 11.8
in January.

<BYLINE>Soybean Rally Continues; Report Suggests Even Higher Prices
^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices bounded higher for the fourth straight
session Tuesday, and analysts said an Agriculture Department
forecast of a steep drop in U.S. stockpiles would keep the rally
from faltering.
   On other markets, grain futures were mixed; precious metals
advanced; livestock, meat and energy futures were mixed; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   The May soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade has
gained 21{ cents a bushel in less than a week, primarily on fears
that this spring's dry weather foreshadows a hot, dry growing
season.
   The soybean market has been particularly sensitive to weather
worries since a USDA report last month predicted the nation's
soybean stockpile would total a relatively low 290 million bushels
on Aug. 31, the end of the current crop year. If that prediction
were correct, a poor harvest this fall could lead to tight supplies
of soybeans next year.
   The USDA released a new report Tuesday afternoon, revising its
1988 soybean carryout estimate to an even lower 275 million
bushels. The USDA also predicted a 1989 carryout of just 145
million bushels, well below market estimates of 150 million to 200
million bushels.
   Analysts said the numbers were bullish and futures prices likely
would rise again Wednesday morning.
   ``I think beans will be at least a nickel and probably more
towards a dime higher, and we could go higher than that,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president and soybean analyst
at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York, noted that the
USDA numbers were based on farmer surveys conducted before planting
even began.
   Soybean futures prices have risen more than 50 cents a bushel
since the USDA's March 31 planting intentions report, and Ms. Leow
said the higher prices probably persuaded farmers to plant more
soybeans.
   ``The odds are that soybean acreage will be higher and (next
year's) soybean ending stocks will also be higher,'' she said.
   Lespinasse agreed, but still predicted soybean futures prices
would rise sharply on Wednesday.
   The USDA also estimated the 1988 winter wheat harvest at 1.62
billion bushels, up 4 percent from last year's harvest and well
above the average market estimate of 1.58 billion bushels. The
agency predicted a sharp drop in wheat stockpiles, however, which
could offset the negative market impact of the high yield estimate.
   The USDA estimated the 1988 corn carryout at 4.11 billion
bushels and the 1989 corn carryout at 3.39 billion bushels, which
analysts termed neutral for corn futures.
   In trading Tuesday, wheat settled 1{ cents to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.03{ a bushel; corn was
\ cent to } cents lower with May at $1.99{ a bushel; oats were 2\
cents to 3\ cents higher with Mayat $1.61} a bushel; soybeans were
5} cents to 7 cents higher with May at $7.05} a bushel.
   Silver futures led the precious metals complex higher in what
analysts described as follow-through buying after Monday's strong
finish.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $2.80 to $4
higher with June at $451.60 a troy ounce; silver was 10 cents to
11.2 cents higher with May at $6.57 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle's performance suggested early positioning ahead of the
USDA's next cattle-on-feed report, which is due out on Monday,
analysts said.
   Gains in the pork markets linked to steady cash hog prices were
limited by a softening wholesale pork market, said Chuck Levitt, an
analyst in Chicago with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Cattle settled .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June
unchanged at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with May at 80.20 cents a pound; live hogs were
.22 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 51.45 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .23 cent lower to .38 cent higher with May
at 51.32 cents a pound.
   Oil prices finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
a second day of featureless trading.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 8
cents higher with June at $17.46 a barrel; heating oil was .04 cent
lower to .16 cent higher with June at 47.74 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .15 cent lower to .12 cent higher with June
at 51.62 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.50 points higher at 258.60.

   Loss-plagued Lorimar Telepictures Corp.
agreed Tuesday to be acquired by Warner Communications Inc. in a
$1.18 billion stock-swap deal that adds a top television producer
to Warner's movie-and-music empire.
   A merger between the two entertainment companies had been widely
expected, since they have been engaged in on-again-off-again merger
talks since early March.
   Lorimar produces such popular network television series as
``Dallas,'' ``Knots Landing'' and ``Alf,'' as well as a strong
lineup of shows that are syndicated, or sold directly to individual
stations.
   Equally important, analysts said, are Lorimar's expected
revenues from future syndication of shows it has produced. New
York-based Warner produces such prime-time series as ``Night
Court'' and ``Spenser for Hire,'' but is stronger in the movie and
record businesses.
   ``We saw a terriffic fit,'' said Lorimar Chairman Merv Adelson,
who would retain day-to-day control for the time being. ``I think
there's a tremendous upside in Warner stock for our shareholders.''
   The agreement, expected to close in September, calls for 0.415
Warner common shares to be exchanged for each Lorimar common share.
   The deal puts a value of about $14 on each of Lorimar's 47
million outstanding common shares, for a total of around $630
million. In addition, Warner would assume Lorimar's debt of about
$550 million.
   Lorimar retains the right to walk away if the merger doesn't
bring its stockholders at least $15 per share, which means Warner's
stock price must average $36 per share.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday,
Warner fell 75 cents a share to close at $32.87{; Lorimar fell 37{
cents to close at $12.75 a share on the American Stock Exchange.
   Among other conditions attached to the deal, Lorimar would be
required to pay Warner $10 million if the deal is cancelled. If
Lorimar accepts a higher offer from another party, Warner would
have an option to buy 18.5 percent of Lorimar for $15 a share.
   Though long a television powerhouse, Lorimar in recent years has
been troubled as its ambitious plans to expand into movies and
home-videos disintegrated _ sometimes causing the company to incur
losses or heavy costs that depressed its earnings.
   For the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Lorimar
posted a net loss of $82.6 million on revenue of $616.8 million.
The loss included $45 million in writedowns on five movies and $22
million in reserves for possible future losses in its home-video
subsidiary.
   Lorimar earlier rejected a $770 million, or $17-a-share,
takeover bid from Denver investor Marvin Davis, the former owner of
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. Davis, who has indicated he may be
willing to go higher, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
   But Adelson dismissed speculation that Davis might sweeten his
bid, saying Lorimar had never been interested in a merger other
than the stock swap negotiated with Warner.
   ``The acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures ... will expand
(Warner's) already broad base of leadership in the entertainment
industry,'' said Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross.
   The merger would team two high-profile show business executives
in Ross and Adelson, who is married to television interviewer
Barbara Walters.
   ``Steve and I have known each other for a long time and we see
eye-to-eye on most things,'' Adelson said. ``We both see ourselves
as entrepreneurial human beings.
   The Lorimar name, staff and Culver City headquarters will be
retained for television production, said Warner spokesman Geoff
Holmes, but he declined to discuss the future of Lorimar's movie or
home-video units.
   Lorimar produces 12 hours of weekly prime-time TV programming
and 16{ hours of syndicated programs; while Warner produces five
hours a week of network shows.
   Lorimar also owns the former MGM movie lot in Culver City, which
reportedly is worth as much as $200 million.

<TEXT>
   Western Publishing Group Inc., a leading
children's book publisher, said Tuesday it was postponing its
annual shareholders meeting for five weeks until June 23 because of
``ongoing merger developments.''
   The announcement of the postponement came one day after Western
Publishing said ``preliminary discussions'' with Gulf & Western
Inc. had been ended by mutual agreement about the possibility of
Gulf & Western acquiring Western Publishing.
   Western Publishing had disclosed last week that it was talking
with Gulf & Western about a possible merger, but said it was
pursuing those talks on a ``non-exclusive basis,'' an indication
that it was also talking with others.
   Ira Gomberg, a spokesman for Western Publishing, declined to
elaborate on the reasons for postponing the shareholders meeting,
which had been scheduled for May 18.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Western Publishing rose 75
cents a share at $19.75. It had fallen $3 a share on Monday.
   Western, which has about 20 million shares of common stock
outstanding, publishes the Golden Book children's series, has an
extensive distribution system for its books, puzzles and games and
is a major commercial printer.

business customers to allow the company to compete with discounts
offered by other long-distance companies.
   The new rate-setting method would allow industry leader AT&T to
offer special rate plans to individual businesses that already have
been offered discount pricing by competing long-distance carriers.
   ``We need to be able to respond to these competitive
situations,'' Larry Garfinkel, AT&T vice president for marketing
services, said Tuesday. ``Customers would be deprived of the
benefits of competition if all carriers cannot compete on an equal
basis.''
   Under federal regulations, AT&T's rates are generally available
to all customers. Other long-distance companies, whose prices are
not regulated, can tailor their prices for an individual company.
   In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission late
Monday, AT&T said its new rate-setting proposal was prompted by MCI
Communications Corp.'s discount offering to Holiday Corp. of
Memphis, Tenn., the nation's largest hotel chain with more than
1,800 affiliate and franchise hotel properties.
   AT&T wants to offer pricing discounts to Holiday Corp.
competitive with MCI's proposed plan.
   Garfinkel said the AT&T proposal is ``absolutely not
deregulation,'' since the FCC will continue its oversight of AT&T's
rates and profits. He also said the company will not set prices for
special packages below cost.
   MCI said it will oppose AT&T's proposal as ``unlawful.'' The
second-largest long-distance carrier said the plan would allow AT&T
to ``ignore long-standing safeguards'' designed to protect the
public from predatory pricing and discrimination by any company
that controls a large share of the market, as AT&T does providing
about 72 percent of the country's long-distance service.
   AT&T spokesman Herb Linnen said the timing of the company's
proposal was coincidental to the FCC's preparations this week for
another step toward radically changing the way AT&T is regulated.
   The FCC on Thursday is expected to unveil a specific proposal to
put in place a new system of regulating AT&T by capping rates
rather than profits. AT&T has been lobbying hard for the change.

<HEAD>Polaroid Unveils Still-Video Camera At Stockholders' Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. unveiled a
high-resolution still-video camera priced at about $20,000 at its
annual stockholders' meeting Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, I. MacAllister Booth, president of the
Cambridge-based company, told shareholders that despite the growth
in electronic screen images, Polaroid believes that print
photography ``will grow dramatically in the foreseeable future.''
   ``Our strategy is to commit to instant hard copy based on our
firm belief that electronic imaging is not going to drive out hard
copy,'' Booth said. ``Rather, it is going to be the driving force
for more instant hard copies than ever before.''
   Polaroid said the new video camera brings high-resolution still
imaging capabilities to video monitoring, recording and
transmission.
   The system includes an electronic still camera, a control unit
for analog to digital converion and digital processing and a
high-reolution video printer capable of matching the camera's
output. It will be available only through direct order.
   Sheldon A. Buckler, Polaroid's director of technical and
industrial photography, said the new camera provides better detail
in stills of video images needed for positive identification or
analysis for surveillance, investigation and quality control.
   But Wall Street analysts minimized the impact of the new camera,
saying Polaroid is a late-starter in the field of video imaging.

<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp. Chairman Bennett S. Le Bow
said Tuesday he has agreed to help plan and finance a friendly
takeover of the financially troubled consumer products company
Allegheny International Inc.
   Le Bow said would cooperate with a committee of equity
investors, one of several groups involved in the Chapter 11
reorganization of Allegheny, the parent of Sunbeam and Oster
appliances.
   ``The attempt here is to forge and create as much value for the
shareholders as possible,'' said Tim Lang, a partner in Spear,
Leeds & Kellog, a New York brokerage. ``I'd say this company has
done a pretty good job of destroying it.''
   Spear, Leeds & Kellogg holds 480,400 shares, or 20 percent of
Allegheny International's $11.25 convertible preferred stock, and
112,900 shares, or 4 percent, of the company's preference stock,
and is one of the key players in the bankruptcy case.
   The equity committee is waging a proxy contest with management
for control of the board of directors.
   Le Bow said a preliminary analysis of Allegheny International
shows he could offer a plan that would make stock in the company
worth more than its present market value.
   Allegheny International's board of directors, excluding the
dissidents' nominees, on Tuesday urged shareholders to oppose the
dissidents' attempt to solicit proxies to elect a majority of the
board at the annual shareholders meeting.
   Allegheny International said previously that while it did not
start the proxy fight it intended to win. The contest could be
decided at a May 20 shareholders meeting, although unsecured
creditors have asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti to cancel
the meeting.
   Management, in resisting the preferred shareholders, cited
record sales and earnings in its on-going consumer products
businesses during the six months ended March 27. Sales rose 14
percent to $511 million, and operating earnings grew 48 percent to
$50.5 million.
   Le Bow said Spear, Leeds & Kellog has granted him options on
Allegheny International shares to encourage him to help formulate
and finance a plan of reorganization. He expressed confidence in
obtaining the financing.
   Allegheny International sought protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws on Feb. 20, and has
since been working on a reorganization plan. Any proposal, though,
would need the approval of Allegheny International's board,
shareholders, creditors and the bankruptcy court.

<HEAD>Directors Won't Consider New Offer, Oppose Sugarman's Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. said Tuesday that its
board of directors would not consider a sweetened $2 billion
takeover bid from Los Angeles investor Burg Sugarman.
   The company also urged shareholders to spurn Sugarman's efforts
to have himself, Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons, and David
Gotterer, vice chairman of two Sugarman companies, elected to Media
General's 10-member board through a proxy fight.
   The company's annual meeting is set for May 20.
   In a letter to shareholders, Media General President James S.
Evans said, ``Our commitment is to the best interest of our
shareholder. We don't believe those interests are at all served by
the likes of Messrs. Sugar, Simmons, Gotterer as represented by
their statements and past actions.
   ``We vigorously oppose their election to the company's board.''
   Media General had said Monday the board would review Sugarman's
sweetened $70-a-share cash bid, but he noted the company's major
shareholder, the family of Chairman D. Tennant Bryan, remained
opposed to the proposal.
   Sugarman originally offered $61.50 a share, or around $1.6
billion.
   The Bryan family owns 71 percent of Media General's 559,168
Class B shares, while Sugarman controls 10 percent of Media
General's 28 million Class A shares.
   Like several media companies, Media General has two classes of
stock to keep control of the company in the hands of a few. While
there are fewer Class B shares outstanding, those shares are more
powerful than the Class A shares.
   Two weeks ago, U.S District Judge Richard L. Williams ruled
Sugarman's original offer would have to be approved by two-thirds
of each class of stockholders, who must vote separately.
   Sugarman's attorney, who promised to appeal, had argued that
Media General's charter allowed a simple majority decision by a
combined vote of shareholders representing the company's two
classes of stock.
   Media General attorneys successfully contended that voting
provision applied to acquisitions made by Media General, not to a
concern trying to acquire it.
   Media General is the parent company of Richmond Newspapers Inc.,
publishers of the Richmond-Times Dispatch and The Richmond
News-Leader. The company also holds other newspaper interests and
owns several television stations.
   Sugarman is chairman of the California-based Barris Industries,
which produces ``The Dating Game'' and other popular television
game shows and the South Carolina-based Giant Group Ltd., a cement
company.

<HEAD>Mazda Plant That Builds Ford Probe Adding Second Shift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FLAT ROCK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Corp.'s assembly plant,
which builds the new Ford Probe and the Mazda MX-6, nearly has
finished hiring and has begun training workers for the second
shift, company officials said Tuesday.
   When the second shift begins production in June, the $550
million plant will employ nearly 3,000 assembly and 400 salaried
workers, Mazda spokesman Jim Gill said. The plant began building
cars in September.
   By August, when it reaches full production, the plant will be
completing 240,000 cars a year. More than 60 percent of them will
be Probes built for Ford Motor Co. to be sold through the Ford
Division.
   But until then, Ford's 4,500 dealers will have to settle for a
small trickle of the sporty two-door hatchbacks, which they say are
in such demand they are moving at premium prices.
   Probe's official introduction is Thursday as a 1989 model, but
dealers have had them for several months. Ford Division General
Manager Thomas Wagner said the plant's Probe production is sold out
through October.
   ``Whatever we get we sell immediately. We can't keep them,''
said Irma Elder, owner of Troy Ford.
   ``It's a good buy, it's sporty, well-priced, economical to
drive. What more can you ask? Since February people have been
coming in asking for Probe.''
   Unfortunately, Elder said, she doesn't get many. The first one
was sold as soon as she got it, so she had to convince the buyer to
let her keep it in the showroom for four weeks so other customers
could see it.
   John Blackwell III, executive vice president of Blackwell Ford
Inc. in Plymouth, said customers are paying over-sticker prices to
get the Ford-designed cars which have been engineered and built by
Mazda.
   Both dealers said the front-wheel-drive Probe fills a void in
Ford's lineup and will not replace the popular rear-wheel-drive
Mustang.
   Elder and Blackwell were among several members of the Ford
dealer council who toured the high-tech Mazda plant on Tuesday.
Ford owns 25 percent of Mazda and the plant sits on the site of
Ford's defunct Michigan Casting facility.
   The highly automated factory includes the final assembly plant,
plastics shop, paint shop and metal-stamping plant. It uses robots
throughout, even to perform tasks such as putting the spare tire in
the trunk.
   It also boasts some ideas not found in other U.S. assembly
plants, such as a hanging conveyor tilted at a 30-degree angle,
making it easier for workers to attach parts to the cars'
underbodies.
   Probe comes in three versions. Standard equipment on all
includes a 2.2-liter engine with 12 valves, four cylinders and
fuel-injection, four-wheel independent suspension, power
rack-and-pinion steering and power front-disc brakes and
retractable headlights.
   The base Probe GL starts at $10,711. The Probe LX starts at
$11,695 and the Probe GT starts at $13,845. All prices including
transportation and handling charges.

   The panel of experts created to solve the
government's budget woes convened for its first public meeting
Tuesday with a pledge that it would finish its work ahead of
schedule.
   But many members of the National Economic Commission quickly
realized it will be no easy task to master the arcane details of
federal budget writing.
   Former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, now head of Union
Pacific Corp., and Washington lawyer Robert Strauss, the
co-chairmen of the 12-member commission, both said the panel was
committed to solving the budget problem in a bipartisan way after
considering all possible solutions.
   Lewis announced that the panel in an earlier closed-door session
had agreed to an accelerated schedule under which its
recommendations would be completed and released on Dec. 21, more
than two months ahead of the deadline called for by law.
   Both Strauss and Lewis previously had indicated that the March
1, 1989, deadline set by Congress for the commission's final report
would be too late to influence the next president's critical first
budget request to Congress, which he traditionally makes soon after
taking office in January.
   At the first meeting, witnesses explained how the budget process
was supposed to work, but some members of the panel had trouble
following the technical language.
   In opening remarks, Lewis said the commission was united in its
belief that ``America cannot continue to outspend its income if we
want to continue this nation's dominant position in the world.''
   ``What we require in dealing with this problem is some true
statesmanship _ a placing of the common good above all others,''
Lewis said. ``We owe that to the generations that will follow us.
Our children and grandchildren have a right to live and work in an
environment that will not be subject to periodic, unpredictable
economic jolts.''
   Strauss said the commission would be involved in an educational
process over the next six months, trying to establish ``a common
factual base from which we can make informed decisions.''
   Among the witnesses who testified Tuesday was Stanley Collender,
director of federal budget policy for the accounting firm of Touche
Ross & Co.
   Collender urged the commission to scrap the current deficit
targets set in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. Collender
said the average $36 billion per year reduction in the budget
deficit, which last year totaled $151.4 billion, were ``phony, more
of a publicity stunt than a serious deficit maximum.''
   He said that reaching a balanced budget by 1993, as called for
under the current law, was very doubtful. He said yearly deficit
reductions of between $15 billion and $20 billion would be more
realistic.
   The commission's 12 members were appointed by President Reagan
and leaders of the House and Senate. Another two members will be
added by the president-elect after the Nov. 8 election.
   Then if things go according to plan, the deal-making will start
in earnest, with the decisions forming the basis for the new
president's first budget to Congress.
   Supporters of the expert panel approach believe that Congress,
protected by the political cover from the commission, will swallow
hard and vote to cut popular programs and raise enough taxes to
finally solve the deficit problem.
   ``Everyone for years has known the solution to the deficit
problem: You either raise taxes or you cut spending,'' said William
Dunkelberg, dean of the business school at Temple University. ``If
the commission provides the mechanism for doing the hard things
that have to be done, but allows members of Congress as individuals
to duck the blame, then it might work.''
   The White House predicts the budget deficit for fiscal 1988 will
be $146.7 billion. The Congressional Budget Office, however,
estimates it will be about $157 billion. The national debt
currently is about $2.5 trillion.
   The idea for a bipartisan commission to deal with the deficit
problem was advanced by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and sponsored in
Congress by Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   Both Dole and Moynihan served on the last successful economic
panel, the Social Security Commission chaired by Alan Greenspan
which in 1983 came up with a bailout plan to put the ailing
benefits system back on its feet.
   Observers are betting that Strauss, a Washington attorney and
former U.S. trade representative, and Lewis, former transportation
secretary and now head of Union Pacific Corp., will have the
negotiating skills needed to bring off a similar success this time
around.
   In addition to Strauss and Moynihan, other Democratic members of
the economic commission are Rep. William Gray, chairman of the
House Budget Committee; Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler Corp.;
Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO; and Felix Rohatyn, partner
with the New York investment firm Lazard Freres.
   In addition to Lewis, other Republican members of the commission
are Caspar W. Weinberger, former defense secretary in the Reagan
administration; Donald Rumsfeld, former defense secretary in the
Ford administration; Sen. Pete Domenici, ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee; Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., a member of
the House Ways and Means Committee; and Dean Kleckner, a Rudd,
Iowa, farmer and president of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

   Affiliated Publications Inc., owner of the Boston
Globe, posted a $14.4 million net loss for its first fiscal quarter
Tuesday, due mainly to losses suffered by its cellular telephone
business.
   The net loss in the quarter ended March 27 compared with a
profit of $8.7 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter.
   Revenue in the first quarter rose to $126.7 million from $102.8
million in first-quarter 1987.
   Excluding its share of the losses of McCaw Communications
Companies Inc., of Kirkland, Wash., Affiliated had income from
consolidated operations of $10.89 million, down slightly from
$10.99 million a year earlier. A year earlier, Affiliated's share
of losses by McCaw, the nation's biggest cellular telephone systems
operator, was $2.2 million.
   Affiliated owns 44.4 percent of McCaw.
   Affiliated is the parent company of Globe Newspaper Co., which
publishes the Globe. It also owns Billboard Publications Inc., a
