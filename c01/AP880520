   The yellow police tape surrounding the
sprawling one-story brick school provided a jarring note on the
quiet, tree-lined, sunny street with its comfortable homes.
   But the tranquility of this affluent North Shore community had
already been shattered by a shooting rampage that left an
8-year-old boy dead and five other children and an adult critically
wounded.
   The children were shot at Hubbard Woods Elementary School in a
15-minute assault by a woman Friday morning in a school restroom
and in a second-grade classroom.
   The woman barricaded herself in a neighboring home and was found
dead by police later in the day. Police said she shot herself once
in the head with a .32-caliber pistol.
   School District 36 Superintentent Don Monroe, his shirt stained
with blood, tried to reassure anxious parents who gathered outside,
and the crowd dispersed quickly.
   ``There were a lot of mothers trying to get to the school''
immediately afterward, said a resident of the neighborhood, Anne
Belmont.
   ``They're all crying on my front lawn,'' said another resident,
Phil Prange.
   ``These things happen 2,000 miles away. They don't happen next
door to you,'' said a third resident, Susan Bosler.
   After the classroom shooting, the drama shifted to the nearby
home, where a young man was shot and the suspect, identified as
30-year-old Lori Dann, barricaded herself inside.
   ``I just heard police surrounding the house, calling, `Lori,
let's get it over with.' I didn't hear any response. Then I heard a
shot, a blast I would say,'' said Hildegard Oberstoetter, a
housekeeper at the home next door.
   The afternoon dragged into evening. Reporters were kept behind a
police line. Trees obscured the houses. Dozens of police officers
waited in the street, and squad cars came and went.
   After eight hours, Winnetka Police Chief Herbert Timm announced
Ms. Dann had been found dead in the house.
   Village residents talked of little else. Teen-agers sitting on
cars in a local gas station were discussing the events, and a man
sat in his garage listening to developments on a police radio.
   The boy's death was only the third slaying in his community
since 1957, Timm said.
   ``We never have a drill for something like this. But we do have
fire and tornado drills, so the kids were on the floor in the other
classrooms'' after the shooting, Monroe said.
   Standing outside the school at the end of the day, Jim Romey
said his 7-year-old daughter, Katie, was in another classroom when
the shooting occurred.
   ``I'm relieved to hear our child is safe. It's a tragedy. It's
just terrible for the family who lost their child,'' he said.
   ``The kids are calm,'' said his wife, Blanche, adding that
school officials ``told us to take them home and let them talk
because they've been talked to a lot today.''
   ``The school system here is known for being fantastic, and they
have handled this whole thing fantastically,'' Ms. Romey said.
   Hubbard Woods ``is a fabulous school _ one of the best in the
country. ... It's a family neighborhood,'' said Ms. Belmont, who
lives nearby with two pre-school-age children.
   The shady suburb north of Chicago is nestled on Lake Michigan
and marked by large homes and comfortable incomes. Chicago Bears
president Michael McCaskey lives there, as do numerous Chicago
realty barons, bankers and industrialists.
   A survey released last year by a Roosevelt University
urbanologist ranked the community of 12,482 the nation's
22nd-wealthiest suburb with an estimated per-capita income of
$35,406.

   Arizona's attorney general took initial
steps Friday toward investigating Gov. Rose Mofford's expenditures
of thousands of dollars in state funds on gifts and decorations
when she was secretary of state.
   Some of the spending appears to have lacked legislative
authorization, according to records and interviews with officials,
although the governor and a close aide said the Legislature had
approved the funds.
   Mrs. Mofford's office issued a statement saying she ``stands
behind'' all the expenditures. Press aide Vada Manager said the
governor would not hold a news conference on the issue because, ``I
don't think there's anything serious enough to have a press
conference over.''
   The governor, in a brief interview with radio station KFYI said
``I never misspent a penny. It was appropriated for VIP gifts and I
used it for that type of purpose. I never used anything for
personal gain.''
   Mrs. Mofford, 65, became governor April 4 when Evan Mecham was
removed from office upon being convicted in a Senate impeachment
trial of misusing state funds and obstructing justice.
   Records examined by The Associated Press showed that Mrs.
Mofford's gift expenditures totaled at least $50,000 for her last
five years as secretary of state.
   Mrs. Mofford used state funds to pay for such things as a
joke-writing service and diet food as well as paintings, watches,
Indian kachina dolls, clocks, flags and knickknacks, typically
charging them to ``other operating expenses'' or ``supplies.''
   House Speaker Joe Lane said he would wait to hear from Attorney
General Bob Corbin and Maricopa County Attorney Tom Collins before
deciding whether to launch an impeachment probe.
   Since Corbin is next in line to succeed Mrs. Mofford, he already
had turned over to Collins an investigation of her financial
disclosure practices. That investigation stemmed from an AP report
that while secretary of state she had failed to include a number of
her business dealings in the state-required reports.
   Corbin said Friday that Collins had agreed to investigate the
gift expenditures as well. He added that whether any criminal or
civil action will be taken will depend on what Collins finds.
   Mrs. Mofford did not respond to AP queries about the gifts and
spoke only briefly to KFYI.
   Earlier this month, she had said that when faced with the need
to present gifts to important visitors as secretary of state, she
``took care of it myself.''
   ``I've paid for a lot of my dinners and all those artifacts and
things that are there,'' Mrs. Mofford continued. ``Only gifts _ we
have a fund for VIP gifts that we are permitted to use that was
appropriated by the Legislature. Other than that, I pay for it out
of my own pocket.''
   Karen Osborne, assistant secretary of state, said the
expenditures had been authorized by the Legislature as early as
1980 when Mrs. Mofford requested permission to spend $5,000 to make
some kind of presentation to visiting dignitaries ``on behalf of
the state.''
   The Legislature's official records show $2,400 in unspecified
``other'' expenses was approved that year and $2,500 in 1981. More
recently, the Legislature has provided lump-sum allocations for the
secretary of state's office with little direction as to how the
funds are divided. The budget this year is $1.9 million.
   Laurie Drobny, the Joint Legislative Budget Committee's staff
analyst for the secretary of state's office in 1980, said she
didn't believe the $2,400 was for gifts but that she could not
recall what it was for.
   Lane also said he didn't know the money was for gifts. He added
that he could understand some of the purchases but that buying a
joke service or diet food ``blows my mind.''
   The state constitution bars the state from giving anything of
value to an individual without public benefit, and state law makes
unauthorized expenditures of public funds a felony.
   Mrs. Osborne said she considered that gifts Mrs. Mofford gave as
secretary of state did result in a public benefit, because they
were aimed at pleasing someone who could bring business to the
state, were in recognition of service to the state or were aimed at
motivating future conduct.
   Records for use of state funds the past five years ago show that
as secretary of state, Mrs. Mofford spent about $9,000 on pens and
other novelties with her name on them, about $6,400 on 30 watches
bearing the state seal, and about $5,700 on kachina and other dolls
and their display cases.
   The total also included about $11,000 for flags, mostly state
and national, some of which were bought from unauthorized vendors
at higher prices than those paid to authorized vendors for similar
flags.
   Other expenditures included $203.70 for a weight-reduction
product shipped to a friend and business partner of Mrs. Mofford,
and $306 for the five years' annual renewal of a joke service that
promises to supply speakers with 120 to 140 new jokes and stories a
month.
   Mrs. Osborne called that ``probably the greatest tool in the
world'' since ``nobody wants to hear a dull, totally dry speech.''
As for the diet food, Mrs. Osborne said she didn't know anything
about it.
   A 1978 protocol-fund statute allows the governor, House speaker
and Senate president to make gifts that promote state interests and
encourage public service. It does not include the secretary of
state.
   After she became governor, Mrs. Mofford said she wanted Mecham's
privately raised protocol fund _ money he was convicted by the
Senate of misusing _ placed in the state General Fund that comes
from tax revenues.
   ``I would not have a protocol fund, period,'' she said. ``I
don't want one.''

   A 2-year-old boy fell off a third-story
balcony, then promptly got up and began walking around after he
landed in the grass with only minor injuries, his mother said.
   ``Owie, Mommy, owie,'' Julie Brown remembered her son, Matthew,
saying after falling off the balcony on Wednesday.
   Ms. Brown, 27, said she had been rushing around Wednesday trying
to get her 8-year-old daughter, Nicole, ready for school. When she
left the room for a moment, Matthew apparently tumbled off the
balcony.
   ``I don't know how he landed, but I guess he got up and was
walking around the parking lot,'' Ms. Brown said.
   Matthew was bleeding at the mouth and chin, and he had other
scrapes and bruises, but he was listed in good condition at Iowa
Methodist Medical Center, a spokesman said.
   ``It's just a miracle,'' said Ms. Brown. ``You can't believe how
far it looks from the balcony to the ground.''

   Evan Mecham is one of several governors or former governors who
have faced criminal charges during or in connection with their
terms of office. Others include:
   _ Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland: accused of accepting bribes during
his tenure as Baltimore County executive from 1962 to 1966 and
governor from 1967 to 1969, Agnew pleaded no contest to one count
of income tax evasion in 1973 and resigned as vice president of the
United States.
   _ Ray Blanton of Tennessee: ousted from office three days before
the end of his term in 1979 amid a clemency-for-cash scandal. He
was indicted in 1980 with two former aides on charges of extortion,
conspiracy, and mail fraud involving the issuance of 12 liquor
store licenses to political friends. He was convicted on June 9,
1981, though not on charges related to the clemency scandal, and
served a three-year sentence. On Jan. 29, 1988, a federal judge
dismissed the mail fraud charges but upheld the extortion and
conspiracy charges. _ Edwin Edwards of Louisiana: Indicted in 1985
on federal racketeering charges in connection with nursing home and
hospital projects. He was acquitted in a second trial.
   _ David Hall of Oklahoma: sentenced to three years for
attempting to bribe Oklahoma's secretary of state and four counts
of extortion. He was convicted after leaving office in 1975.
   _ Ed Jackson of Indiana: Tried in 1928 on charges of conspiracy
to bribe Gov. McCray while Jackson was secretary of state in 1923.
He won a directed verdict of acquittal because the statute of
limitations had lapsed.
   _ Otto Kerner of Illinois: convicted of income tax evasion,
conspiracy and mail fraud stemming from a stock scandal in his
second term as governor. Kerner was a federal appeals judge when he
was convicted in 1973.
   _ William Langer of North Dakota: removed from office in 1934
after being convicted of conspiracy to obstruct operation of
federal relief activities and soliciting money from federal
employees for political purposes. The conviction was overturned,
and Langer was cleared of all charges in his fourth trial. He was
elected governor in 1936 and later served 19 years as a U.S.
senator.
   _ Richard W. Leche of Louisiana: a protege of Huey Long, he was
elected governor in 1936 and quickly became wealthy. ``When I took
the oath of office, I didn't take any vow of poverty,'' he once
said. Leche was indicted on criminal charges including
misappropriation of materials to improve his property and gouging
the State Highway Commission on truck sales. He resigned in 1939,
was convicted in 1940 and was sentenced to prison. He was pardoned
by President Truman in 1953.
   _ Marvin Mandel of Maryland: indicted by a federal grand jury on
24 counts on mail fraud, bribery and other charges under the
federal racketeering statute. He served 14 months in prison. On
Nov. 12, 1987, a federal judge threw out Mandel's conviction,
citing a recent Supreme Court ruling that set up stronger
guidelines for mail fraud.
   _ Warren McCray of Indiana: Indicted in 1923 on charges of
misrepresenting his holdings in loan applications, and was
convicted of mail fraud in 1924. He resigned, served three years in
prison and was pardoned by President Hoover in 1930.
   _ Arch Moore Jr. of West Virginia: indicted by a federal grand
jury in 1975 during his second term in office. He and an
administrative aide were accused of extorting $25,000 from the
president of a financial holding company. He was acquitted in 1976.

   A whole class of fourth-graders whose teacher
failed to make the grade must go to summer school before they can
be promoted, says their principal, one of four who tried
unsuccessfully to fire the teacher.
   ``It is really a joke that the system allows this to happen,''
said Dyanne Dandridge-Alexander, principal of Spencer Elementary
School, where Grace Currin teaches. ``Those children deserve a
better teacher, a better education.''
   Currin ``has not handed in a lesson plan all year,''
Dandridge-Alexander said, ``and when you ask her about it, she says
`I left it at home.'
   ``The noise level in the class is unbelievable. Kids are
fighting. Children are rolling around on the floor. They are
throwing chairs across the room. One day I walked into her
classroom and said, `Did you see that chair fly across the room?'
and she said, `I told them not to do that.'''
   The city's schools are saddled with too many students and too
little money, and the result too often is chaos, the Chicago
Tribune concluded after a seven-month examination of a system that
Secretary of Education William Bennett has called the worst in the
nation.
   In addition, a lenient administration, a powerful teachers union
and a misguided state law have created an environment that protects
incompetent teachers and ignores the children the teachers are
supposed to educate, the Tribune said Thursday in its weeklong
series on the system.
   The newspaper found that of 139 teachers who, over the last five
years, were so lacking in attendance, discipline, teaching ability
or relationships with their students that their principals moved to
fire them, 99 are still in the classroom.
   ``I am part of the problem, but remember, you can't expect
miracles when you have low achievers,'' said Currin, 56, who has
taught for 30 years.
   ``There always will be discipline problems in that class,'' said
Currin, whose most recent assignment is at Spencer, in an
impoverished neighborhood on the city's near Northwest Side. ``It's
the kind of children I teach.''
   During her career, Currin has received at least 12 ``excellent''
ratings and five ``superior'' ratings. But she also has received
four unsatisfactory ratings since the 1983-84 school year, the last
this March from Dandridge-Alexander, the newspaper reported.
   Since a new state law took effect in January, an unsatisfactory
rating is the first step in the termination procedure, which could
take a year or longer. The newspaper reported three of Currin's
principals attempted to have her fired under previous guidelines.
   Currin told the Tribune her career goal now is retiring ``at
full pension.''
   She did not return phone messages left for her at the school
Thursday.
   ``Incompetent teachers are a disservice to everyone, especially
the teaching profession,'' Chicago Teachers Union spokesman Chuck
Burdeen said Thursday. ``Any principal who says he can't get rid of
an obviously bad teacher is either lazy or must think assassination
is the only answer.
   ``Secondly, those who are critical of urban school systems are
usually the ones like Bennett and the Reagan administration, who
are taking away the very same resources needed to meet the
tremendous needs of these kids,'' he said.
   Dandridge-Alexander said she isn't concerned as much with blame
as she is with correcting the problem. Last month she called
parents in to monitor Currin's classes, and ``they are at a point
where they think it is hopeless,'' she said.
   Because of the new state law giving teachers rated
unsatisfactory a year's work before they can be dismissed, Currin
will be able to continue teaching until at least March 1989.
   The new law was part of a 1985 state school reform package, its
intent to give school management better tools to weed out weak
teachers. But lobbying by teachers unions made the law into yet
another measure making it even more difficult to fire teachers,
according to the Tribune.
   ``It's a terrible shame,'' said Dandridge-Alexander. ``Those
children have suffered because they have a totally inept teacher
that no one has been able to fire.''

   With a little financial help from abroad
and a lot of enthusiasm from 200,000 volunteers, opponents of
Chile's military government have launched a campaign they say will
keep fraud out of this year's presidential election.
   Ten opposition parties, from left to right, have united in the
campaign of door-to-door voter education, poll-watching on election
day and independent vote counting afterward.
   Leaders of the National Election Command for Democracy maintain
that the system is necessary because they believe fraud tipped a
1980 plebiscite to approve a government-drafted constitution.
   Genaro Arriagada, secretary general of the command, said the
1980 plebiscite, in which the government received 67 percent of the
vote, ``lacked the minimal conditions necessary to guarantee any
honest election.''
   That vote took place without voter registries, because the old
ones had been destroyed by the military shortly after they seized
power in 1973. Polling stations were manned only by
government-appointed officials, without any opposition or
independent supervision.
   Arriagada said a national census taken two years after the vote
showed that in several cities the number of people who voted in the
plebiscite was higher than the number of residents in the cities.
   The government has denied accusations of fraud.
   ``The upcoming presidential plebiscite will be very different,''
Arriagada said. He said voter registries now have reopened, ``and
this time we have the capacity to guarantee a clean vote.''
   In the plebiscite scheduled for an unspecified date later this
year, Chileans will be able to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on a single,
military-appointed candidate for the 1989-97 presidential term. If
the candidate is rejected by voters, a competitive election will
take place a year later.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the 73-year-old army commander who
has ruled since 1973, is considered the most likely candidate.
   Ricardo Lagos, leader of the Socialist Party and a key member of
the National Election Command, said 700 specialists are training
the 200,000 volunteers throughout the country to work as
poll-watchers on election day.
   He added in an interview that the opposition will be able to
have three to five monitors at each of the 20,000 or so voting
places.
   ``We can guarantee to every citizen that his vote will be
properly accounted for, and that it will remain secret,'' Lagos
said.
   Some volunteers have already visited hundreds of thousands of
voters in the door-to-door campaign to ``explain to them that this
time the vote will be totally clean,'' he said.
   Lagos added that part of the financing for the campaign has come
``from groups abroad interested in the restoration of democracy in
Chile.''
   He said the cost is relatively low, however. He estimated his
Socialist Party will spend the equivalent of around $100,000.
   Lagos did no identify the foreign groups sending money, but the
National Endowment for Democracy of the United States and several
West European foundations, especially in West Germany, Italy and
Sweden, have been officially reported in the past as granting
financial aid to Chilean democratic dissident groups.
   The National Election Command also has organized a nationwide
computerized vote-counting system to operate independently of the
government system.
   Eduardo Arriagada, an engineer in charge of the Vote Counting
Center said ``we will be able to quickly deliver a projection of
the vote and complete returns.''
   Eric Campana, a leading electoral expert of the Christian
Democratic Party, the largest in the opposition, said, ``The system
we are implementing fully guarantees a clean vote. There will be no
fraud this time. Chileans can rest assured of that.''
   Campana said volunteers trained as poll-monitors show ``an
enormous enthusiasm.''
   ``Many of them are paying for their travel and other expenses
connected with the campaign out of their own pockets.''
   Juan Gabriel Valdes, who works at the Vote Counting Center,
said, however, old legislation granting the government emergency
powers could still be invoked.
   ``That legislation, for example, would allow the government to
prevent us from announcing the returns we will be gathering,''
Valdes said.
   That, said Lagos, is ``the only fraud possibility that remains
open.''

<TEXT>
   This week's riots make clear that the
militant political opposition remains strong despite substantial
democratic reforms.
   Thousands of students and dissidents opposed to President Roh
Tae-woo's government battled police in the streets. Protest leaders
claimed South Korea is not a democracy, as they had during the
authoritarian regime of Roh's predecessor and ally, Chun Doo-hwan.
   Protesters chanted: ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and
``Destroy the murder regime!'' They hurled firebombs and rocks at
riot police during the most violent unrest in months.
   The scale was much smaller than the huge protests of last summer
but the scenes and slogans were the same, demonstrating that South
Korean politics remain turbulent despite the professed desire of
all parties to build a stable democratic system.
   Anti-American sentiment, always present in political protests,
seemed particularly evident this time.
   ``Yankee go home!'' was shouted along with ``Execute Roh
Tae-woo!'' Protesters burned a homemade American flag and attacked
a U.S. cultural center. Opposition groups, especially radical
students, remain eager to take their causes into the streets. The
government still limits some political activity and is quick to use
riot police to break up protests.
   Many South Koreans still distrust Roh because he helped Chun
seize power in 1980, when both were army generals, and played a
prominent role in Chun's regime, serving as chairman of the
government Democratic Justice Party.
   That wariness was reflected in Roh's slender victory in the
December presidential election over a divided opposition, and the
government party's loss of its majority in parliamentary elections
last month.
   Opposition groups demand an investigation of his role in
suppression of the 1980 Kwangju uprising, in which at least 191
people were killed. This week's protests marked the eighth
anniversary, on Wednesday, of the revolt in the southern city.
   In addition to being far smaller than those that forced Chun to
hold elections, the latest protests have attracted little public
support and there is little sign that they will become a threat to
the government.
   The 1987 protests mushroomed into mass demonstrations almost
overnight, however, and political observers avoid firm predictions
about South Korean politics. When Roh replaced Chun as president in
February, it was the first peaceful transfer of power in the
nation's 40-year history.
   All indications are that both the government and the main
opposition parties want to avoid major political unrest before the
Olympic Games are held here in September. South Koreans see the
games as a national triumph that will give the nation a place on
the world stage.
   Roh has worked hard to build public confidence. He promised to
introduce full democracy while ensuring political stability, and
has made significant changes.
   Many curbs on politics imposed by Chun have been removed,
creating a sharp contrast to 1987, when riot police took harsh
action to disperse even minor peace;ful demonstrations.
   Roh tries to project himself as a ``common man'' and has
discarded much of the presidency's aloofness. Press curbs have been
removed, most forms of self-expression are allowed and opposition
parties operate freely.
   Some political controls still apply, however. Street protests
against the government still are likely to be broken up and scores
of dissidents remain in jail, serving long sentences for political
activity.
   Many South Koreans feel real democracy is not possible until
control by the military, government bureaucracy, big business and
other powerful factions is ended.
   People in the streets complain that Roh has yet to deliver on
election promises of major social and economic reforms, including
doubling pay for industrial workers and the poor.
   A more fundamental problem lies in the traditional South Korean
belief that compromise is the greatest sign of weakness. Political
factions believe only one point of view is right and all others
must be defeated or even destroyed.
   Political leaders on all sides agree such an outlook blocks the
road to democracy, but seem unable to change it.

   The surrender of Sikh extremists in
their sacred Golden Temple did not end the war of terror through
which they hope to create a nation called Khalistan, the Land of
the Pure.
   During the 10 days Sikh gunmen and their sympathizers spent
inside the temple complex, surrounded by about 2,800 policemen and
soldiers, their comrades killed 133 people in the holy city of
Amritsar and other parts of Punjab state.
   Twenty-five more people were reported killed Thursday, the day
after the surrender at the temple in Amritsar. They included two
Hindu priests and a Sikh holy man.
   It is from Punjab, a rich northern agricultural state, that the
radicals would create Khalistan. It is the only state where Sikhs,
who make up only 2 percent of India's 800 million people, are in
the majority.
   Julio F. Ribeiro, former police chief of Punjab and now security
adviser to the state government, was asked if the surrender
indicated an end to terrorism. He replied: ``No, far from it.''
   Bomb disposal squads searched for hidden explosives Thursday in
the 400-year-old Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of Sikhism.
Police said four more bodies were found inside, bringing the death
toll of the siege to 46.
   A committee of Sikh elders that manages the temple conferred
about preparations to reopen the gold-domed shrine.
   Sikh extremists began fighting for a separate homeland six years
ago, accusing the Hindu-dominated federal government of
discrimination and of hampering economic development in Punjab.
Thousands of people have been killed since then.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi signed a peace agreement with
moderate Sikhs in 1985, but it fell apart within a year.
   The Sikh extremists, initially blamed for scattered killings,
have attacked loaded buses, sleeping villagers and congested
markets in recent years. At least 1,088 people have been killed in
Punjab so far this year, compared to 1,032 for all 1987.
   Most victims are Hindus, but an increasing number of Sikh
moderates are being slain.
   Police estimate the radicals have more than 3,000 men under
arms, with increasingly sophisticated weapons.
   The greatest fear of Gandhi's government is that the separatist
movement will become a full-scale civil war and encourage
insurgencies among other minorities.
   ``So far, the terrorists are a small section of the
population,'' one official said privately. ``We want to keep it
that way.''
   Support for the extremists within the Sikh community may be
waning. After an army raid on the Golden Temple complex in 1984,
angry Sikhs held rallies.
   But hardly any Sikhs objected publicly to the siege of the
temple that ended Wednesday, and a gathering of Sikh temple
managers in New Delhi passed a resolution Wednesday praising the
government's ``rescue'' of the shrine.
   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered the 1984 raid to drive out
extremists taking shelter in the temple. About 1,200 people were
killed. Two of Mrs. Gandhi's Sikh guards assassinated her five
months later.
   Prominent Sikhs generally believe the violence will continue
until the government of Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's son and successor,
reaches a political compromise with the militants.
   Kushwant Singh, a respected Sikh writer, urged the government
recently to abandon its practice of searching for a single moderate
Sikh to lead peace efforts.
   ``What we have to find is not a person or persons to lead the
Punjab, but (a way) to set out principles of conduct and stick to
them no matter what the immediate consequences,'' he wrote in The
Hindustan Times newspaper.
   He advocated release of hundreds of Sikhs detained without
trial, prosecution of Hindu politicians and others accused of
instigating the anti-Sikh riots in 1984, and new investment to
stimulate Punjab's faltering economy.
   Gandhi's 1985 accord with moderates called for settlement of
land and water disputes between Punjab and neighboring Haryana
state, investigation of the 1984 riots and speedy handling of
arrest and detention cases.
   He put Punjab under federal rule in May 1987, after the
agreement had failed, but in March of this year returned to a
softer approach and ordered the release from prison of militant
Sikh high priest Jasbir Singh Rode.
   Rode was arrested last week trying to march on the temple to end
the police siege.

   Like the one that got away, the Great
Anglers' Strike of '88 is assured of an honorable place in the
folklore of Irish fishing.
   It is a tale of defiance, anger and of farce tinged with menace.
It invokes the memory of Ireland's freedom wars, reflects rural
resentment against big-city bureaucrats, and climaxes with an
11th-hour truce mediated by an archbishop.
   And all because of a fishing license.
   The trouble began on New Year's Day, when a law took effect
requiring anglers, for the first time, to buy licenses.
   At 15 pounds ($26.50) for a year's trout fishing and 10 pounds
($15.60) for other fish, the permits aren't exorbitant or unusual
for Europe. But the anglers were outraged.
   They threatened to shut down angling and deal a severe blow to
western Ireland's multimillion dollar tourism industry unless the
license law was withdrawn. The government refused, and in mid-April
the strike began.
   Signs popped up along roads and at fishing venues saying ``No
Rod License'' and ``Licensed Anglers Not Welcome Here.'' Angling
clubs declared their waters off-limits to fishers. Hotels told
guests with bookings to stay away. Fishing stores refused to sell
the licenses.
   Dark tales circulated of anglers' car tires being slashed and a
fishing boat being sawed in half. True or not, they had the desired
effect.
   By mid-May, as the lakes and rivers swarmed with trout feasting
on the newly hatched mayflies, not an angler was in sight, and all
angling competitions were canceled.
   Dick Willis, head of the Munster Trout Fly Anglers' Association,
says it's not the money, but the principle.
   ``We believe we have a God-given right to fish,'' said the
54-year-old pub owner, smacking the dashboard of his car.
   ``I want to hand down to my children and grandchildren what my
forefathers gave to me _ the right to fish over these waters for
free.''
   In the tiny County Cork village of Kildorrery, Willis' friend
Peter Collins harked back 70 years to Ireland's war for
independence from Britain.
   ``My father and Dick's father put their lives on the line
fighting for our freedom, and freedom includes the right to fish,''
he said.
   ``It's a battle for control,'' Willis said. ``We anglers have
developed these waters, cleaned up pollution, restocked them,
without one penny in government aid, and we want to keep it that
way.''
   Commented lawmaker Enda Kenny: ``In the land of Capt. (Charles)
Boycott, attitudes have become deeply entrenched,'' a reference to
the 19th-century land agent who lost his crops to a peasants'
boycott and gave his name to the English language.
   The debt-ridden economy urgently needs cash, and the government
sees nothing wrong with the angling licenses. But its attitude is
under attack.
   ``It is government by diktat rather than by any sort of
consensus,'' charged the Cork Examiner. ``This whole matter has
been handled in a very nonsensical manner.''
   Indeed, the law passed so quickly and with so little fanfare
that the government tourism agency didn't have time to alter its
latest promotional literature, which still says Irish waters are
license-free.
   Meanwhile, the $60 million annual tourism industry in western
Ireland says hotels catering to anglers have been hit hard by
cancellations.
   ``We are facing ruin at the moment,'' said June Hodgson, who
runs a classy anglers' hotel on Lake Corrib in County Galway.
   ``It's devastating, heartbreaking to look out over an empty lake
and see no boats,'' she said Tuesday.
   Unbeknownst to her, however, higher powers were working to get
the anglers and the government off the hook.
   Late Wednesday, the Archbishop of Tuam, Dr. Joseph Cassidy,
announced he had secretly negotiated a deal whereby the licensing
law would not be implemented until further discussion.
   Tommy Tuck of the Anti-Rod-Licensing Campaign saw this as a
face-saving compromise and said the boats would return to Corrib
later. But Willis remained suspicious.
   ``I don't see any government commitment to repeal the law, so
for the time being our strike is still on,'' he said.
   ``This is a tax on our sport,'' he said. ``If they get away with
this, next year it'll be the tennis racket, then the golf club,
then the hurling stick. You know governments. Once they get one leg
in, it's all over. Next year they'll double it, then treble it.''

   Carlos Lehder Rivas, armed with
Colombian contacts and a New York street education, turned a prison
cell fantasy into the world's first high-tech cocaine-smuggling
ring, authorities say.
   At the height of his power in the early 1980s, Lehder was a key
figure in the Medellin cartel, the Colombian drug-trafficking ring
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine brought into this
country, according to U.S. indictments. He was convicted Thursday
on all 11 counts of smuggling lodged against him.
   ``Lehder was one of the four managers for the
multibillion-dollar cartel,'' said Jack Hook, spokesman for the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Miami. ``He had hundreds
of millions of dollars pass through his bank accounts in a short
period of time.''
   Lehder owned an island in the Bahamas, gave television
interviews from a Colombian jungle hideaway, showed a fondness for
Adolf Hitler and John Lennon and even organized his own political
party to fight ``U.S. imperialism.''
   In a 1985 interview from the jungle, where he was a fugitive,
Lehder called his nation's stimulants the Achilles' heel of
imperialism.
   ``If coke, coal or marijuana, or gold, or diamonds, or coffee or
whatever we have, is going to provide a cornerstone for us to
remove imperialism from Colombia and Latin America, well then, so
be it,'' he said.
   U.S. authorities kept pressing the Colombian government, and on
Feb. 4, 1987, Lehder was captured for extradition by the Colombian
government after a short firefight outside a Medellin mansion. He
wound up in Jacksonville facing a federal jury.
   Trial testimony, drug agents and prosecutors painted Lehder as a
pioneer in drug trafficking with a grand design to traffic tons of
cocaine through the Bahamas.
   Son of a German father and Colombian mother, Lehder grew up in
Colombia's coffee-growing region of Armenia, then moved to New York
at age 15.
   His brushes with the law began a few years later. In 1974, he
was sentenced to the federal correctional insitution in Danbury,
Conn., for auto theft and marijuana possession.
   Lehder and a prison mate talked about cocaine as the wave of the
future, and pored over an atlas to find a small island they could
buy as a waystation, authorities said.
   After he was deported to Colombia in 1975, Lehder allegedly
began smuggling cocaine into the United States in small amounts,
concealing it in the lining of suitcases.
   Soon he was hiring other ``mules,'' and graduated to using
large, long-range planes to fly several hundred kilograms at a time
out of Colombia.
   Lehder established his base on Norman's Cay, a small Bahamian
island that U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle characterized as ``an
aircraft carrier of cocaine.'' His occupation of the island was
allegedly blessed by Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
after a series of bribes, according to trial testimony. Pindling
has denied the allegation, and has not been charged.
   Defense attorneys Edward R. Shohat and Jose Quinon contended
Lehder was a businessman who wanted to develop the Bahamian island
as a resort for wealthy Europeans and South Americans. They
introduced into evidence a promotional film made by Lehder which
extolled the island's virtues.
   But according to trial testimony, Lehder soon was flying
shipments from Norman's Cay to small airstrips in Florida and
Georgia.
   ``Carlos Lehder and Henry Ford had a lot in common,'' Merkle
said in his closing arguments. ``Carlos Lehder was the pioneer of
the mass transportation of cocaine for the American consumer.''
   Like many pioneers, money was not Lehder's only objective.
Merkle charged that Lehder also viewed cocaine as a revolutionary
tool.
   Steve Yakovac, who met Lehder in 1976, said Lehder ``wanted to
build a kingdom based on cocaine. ... He pretty much thought he was
going to take on the world.''
   Outside Lehder's Bavarian-style resort of Posada Alemana stands
a symbolically bullet-pocked nude statue of his hero, slain former
Beatle John Lennon.
   At his trial, several witnesses testified that Lehder also
idolized Hitler and kept swastikas, the symbol of Hitler's Nazi
Germany, in his home.
   By 1982, Lehder was spending most of his free time back in
Armenia, developing a resort, buying ranches, starting a newspaper
and forming a political party. He railed against the U.S.-Colombian
extradition treaty, since voided by that nation's supreme court,
calling it an example of U.S. imperialism.
   DEA agents say Lehder was active in the drug-related violence
that swept Colombia, working with guerrilla forces to arrange the
assassination of government officials who opposed the drug trade.
   Lehder's operation began to unravel when Bahamian forces and the
DEA began to focus on Norman's Cay, with the help of marijuana
smuggler Ed Ward, who had joined forces with Lehder in 1978 after
meeting him on the island.

   The former president of a Maryland Coca-Cola
bottler and the chairman of the company that once owned a rival
Pepsi-Cola bottling operation have been convicted of price fixing
by a federal jury.
   Sentencing for James J. Harford, former president of
Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Silver Spring, Md., and
Morton M. Lapides, chairman of the board of Allegheny Beverage
Corp. of Cheverly, Md., has not been set. The two face a maximum of
three years in prison.
   They were convicted Thursday of conspiring to set the wholesale
price of their products between February 1983 and the fall of 1985.
Allegheny Beverage was the parent company of Allegheny Pepsi-Cola
Bottling Co.
   In the six-week trial, prosecutors sought to show that both
companies enjoyed higher profits because of the artifical inflation
of their wholesale prices. They provided no estimate of cost to the
consumer.
   ``They didn't want a price war... and gave a green light to
price-fixing,'' said assistant U.S. Attorney David Jordan of the
defendants.
   A third executive indicted, Odis R. Allen, vice president of
Mid-Atlantic, pleaded guilty March 22 to one count of price fixing.
   Prosecutors said Allen met numerous times with other soft-drink
executives to scheme about boosting wholesale prices of both Coke
and Pepsi.
   The defense contended that Harford and Lapides were unaware of
what was happening, and were hostile competitors who had fought
each other in court and in the marketplace.
   The indictments came out of a wide-ranging Justice Department
probe of the soft drink industry.
   In March, Allegheny and Mid-Atlantic agreed to refund $45,000 to
state and local governments for cola bought by school districts
during the time of the alleged price fixing.

   A white former police officer, acquitted of
state charges in the 1983 shooting death of a black man, was
indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury for civil rights
violations in the same shooting.
   U.S. Attorney John Volz said the indictment charges Stephen
Michael Rosiere with shooting Gerard Glover, 18, in the back on
Aug. 31, 1983. The federal charges accuse Rosiere of violating
Glover's civil rights.
   The maximum penalty in the federal case would be life in prison.
Rosiere's attorney, Arthur Lemann III, said he would try to get the
indictment dismissed on the grounds that it subjects Rosiere to
double jeopardy.
   Volz would not say whether any new evidence was uncovered in the
federal investigation.
   Asked why it took so long to bring the federal charges, Volz
would say only that prosecutors had been watching post-trial
developments and felt the time finally had come to move on the case.
   He said federal officials were interested in the case because
``the boy was shot in the back riding on the back of a motorcycle
fleeing from what was at worst a traffic arrest.''
   Also, Rosiere and his partner admitted that they planted a gun
near the scene to make it appear that the shooting was in
self-defense, he said.
   Glover, the son of a policewoman, was a passenger behind the
driver of a speeding motocycle that Rosiere and his partner were
chasing.
   Rosiere testified during the trial that he thought he was being
fired upon and that his own gun went off when the police car
accelerated. His partner, who testified in exchange for immunity,
said no one fired from the cycle.
   Rosiere, a nine-year officer, was suspended from the police
force after the shooting and was fired three months later. He was
charged in state court and convicted of second-degree murder in
1984.
   The verdict was overturned by the Louisiana Supreme Court in
1985 and Rosiere was aquitted in a second trial in 1986. He works
as a carpenter in New Orleans.

   Defending champ Johnny Chan capped his
comeback fight with a queen-high straight on the final hand
Thursday to beat rookie Eric Seidel of New York for the $700,000
first prize in the World Series of Poker.
   Chan, who at one point was down more than $1.1 million in chips
to Seidel, used the straight to beat Seidel's two queens and win
the final $592,000 pot. ``It's not over until it's over,'' said
Chan. ``I wasn't about to give up.''
   It was the second straight World Series win for the 30-year-old
Las Vegas restaurateur, who beat a field of 167 players over four
days in the Texas Hold `Em tournament.
   Chan, who entered the final day's table of six remaining players
with $529,000 in chips and the lead, had only $270,000 in chips to
$1.4 million for Seidel when head-to-head play among the two
finalists began.
   Chan risked all his chips on the first hand against Seidel, who
folded, then steadily mounted a comeback that saw him go ahead with
$1.2 million in chips to $470,000 for Seidel.
   Seidel, however, came back to win the game's biggest pot _ more
than $1.2 million _ with a pair of 9s to Chan's pair of 8s, and the
game turned into a marathon with both players betting
conservatively.
   Seidel, 28, playing in his first Series, was down to $296,000
when he threw all his chips in on the pair of queens. ``I'm not
unhappy with what I did, but it would have been nice to win,'' he
said. He wins $280,000 for second place.
   Finishing third and winning $140,000 was Ron Graham of Tacoma,
Wash. Humberto Bremnes of Costa Rico earned $77,000 for fourth,
while T.J. Cloutier of Dallas won $63,000 for fifth place.

   Mikhail Baryshnikov, whose stage
appearances have been sparing in recent years, will launch a
five-week national tour with dancers from the American Ballet
Theater with a July 1 performance here.
   Baryshnikov is expected to dance the title role in George
Balanchine's ``Apollo,'' the male lead in Balanchine's jazzy ``Who
Cares?'' and in Jerome Robbins ``Other Dances'' at the Six Flags
over Texas amusement park.
   The 40-year-old dancer was forced to cancel a two-day Dallas
engagement last August because of an ankle injury.
   Baryshnikov was a member of the Soviet Union's Kirov Ballet when
he defected in 1974 while on tour in Toronto. He joined the
American Ballet Theater, then danced briefly with the New York City
Ballet before becoming artistic director of the ABT.
   He also had starring roles in the movies ``The Turning Point,''
``White Nights'' and ``Dancers.''

   The transcontinental custody dispute over
the 5-year-old son of actor Peter O'Toole awaits a decision by an
English court, says the attorney for the child's mother.
   ``We're waiting to see whether England has jurisdiction over the
child,'' said Raoul Felder, attorney for Karen Somerville O'Toole,
O'Toole's former girlfriend. The decision was expected Monday.
   Monmouth County Superior Court Judge Alexander D. Lehrer ordered
O'Toole to return the child, Lorcan, to his mother by Tuesday, but
O'Toole refused.
   O'Toole, 55, is in London with the boy and is being fined $1,000
a day by the New Jersey court for failure to comply with the order,
his attorney, Jeffrey P. Weinstein, said Thursday.
   If the English court rules that the child is not within its
jurisdiction, Felder said he will seek an arrest warrant for
O'Toole. That would prevent the actor from entering the United
States without facing arrest, Felder said.
   The case is being heard in Monmouth County because O'Toole
bought a home near here for Lorcan and Ms. O'Toole, 39.
   The couple never married but Ms. O'Toole took the actor's last
name. They broke up shortly after Lorcan's birth.

trial next month in Dallas on charges of assaulting a police
officer at a Dallas nightspot New Year's morning.
   Earle, in turn, has asked that assault charges be filed against
the officer, Sgt. L.R. Allen of the Dallas Police Department.
   Dallas police said the Nashville singer punched and kicked Allen
as the officer tried to break up a fight between Earle and his

attacked him from behind.
   A Dallas police spokesman said the department's internal affairs

reprimand Allen.
   Earle was charged with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, and a
felony count of aggravated assault. His trial was set for June 6.

   An explosion blew a 12-ton metal door off
a pressure vessel at General Electric Co's steam turbine plant
Thursday, killing one worker and injuring two others.
   The explosion took place at about 3:40 a.m. in Building 273, the
largest building and main manufacturing plant for steam turbines
and generators at the Schenectady plant, said GE spokesman Larry
Stone.
   Killed in the explosion was 60-year-old Thomas Dwojakowski of
Schenectady, a GE worker since 1956, Stone said.
   Stone said a metal door weighing 12 tons was blown off the
pressure vessel, called an autoclave, used in curing insulation
applied to a component in the manufacturing of generators.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating the accident, Stone said, as well as GE's own
investigation team.

   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' new
government won a Senate vote of confidence in a step toward
advancing its program to end the country's age-old linguistic
strife.
   The vote Thursday endorsed the program of the 10-day-old
center-left government that the House of Representatives approved
on Sunday.
   The votes came seven months after Martens' previous center-right
alliance government fell apart in a linguistic dispute.
   Martens now plans to put into effect sweeping constitutional
reforms to quell perennial bickering between Belgium's 5.5 million
Dutch speakers and 4.5 million French speakers. His new alliance
plans to boost the powers of autonomy of northern Flanders and
southern Wallonia, Belgium's two linguistic regions.
   The prime minister has said he will send the constitutional
changes by August to Parliament, where he will need a two-thirds
majority.

   Republican George Bush basked on Thursday in
the praise of President Reagan who called him ``an important part
of everything we have achieved in this so-called revolution.''
   The vice president also received a dispensation of sorts from
the White House to disagree with the president's policies.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Thursday,
``He has his ideas on how he's going to want to do things, and
that's fine.''
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post, quoting sources, reported in
Friday's editions that Bush urged at a high-level meeting of
administration policymakers that negotiations with Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega be ended. Bush campaign spokesman
Peter Teeley said Thursday night he had no knowledge of any such
recommendation by the vice president.
   Bush met held a private evening meeting with civil rights
leaders at his official residence. The vice president's chief of
staff told reporters that Bush asked the black leaders to ``share
open discussion with him.''
   Bush called it a ``very good session.''
   Benjamin Hooks, head of the NAACP and one of the participants,
said a wide range of issues was discussed. But Hooks said: ``At
this point I'd say the vice president has a long way to go if he
actually expects to get a substantial black vote.''
   John E. Jacob, president of the National Urban League, who also
attended the meeting, said the fact that the meeting had taken
place was in itself important.
   ``This is the first meeting of this type in some eight years,
and that is significant,'' he said.
   Jacob told a recent news conference that the group was trying to
set up a similar session with Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Jacob, a supporter of Democrat Jesse Jackson, said, ``Any
candidate who wins will have to come to get the black votes.
Neither (Bush nor Dukakis) has demonstrated that he has the
capacity to get black voters.''
   Reagan, who officially endorsed his vice president two weeks
ago, made his comments in an interview with foreign broadcasters.
   ``I have to say that the vice president has been an important
part of everything that we have achieved in this so-called
revolution in these seven years or so,'' he said.
   ``I have always believed that vice presidents in our system of
government were relegated to a kind of just standing and waiting
position, and I think that's a waste of talent. I have always
believed that your vice president should be like a vice president
in a private corporation. He should be an executive with duties and
functions.''
   Reagan cited Bush's work at the helm of task forces, one on
reducing regulations and another on drugs.
   Reagan's spokesman took pains to make clear that Bush was his
own man and was free to differ from administration policy.
Fitzwater spoke a day after comments by Bush and his aides
suggested a break with Reagan on the question of dismissing
drug-trafficking indictments against Noriega.
   ``I won't bargain with terrorists and I won't bargain with drug
dealers either, whether they are on U.S. or foreign soil,'' Bush
said Wednesday.
   ``I'm saying that he has his ideas on how he's going to want to
do things, and that's fine,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``As we go through this campaign, I would expect to see the vice
president speaking out on a number of issues in terms of what he
would do,'' he said. ``I expect a number of them will be different
than existing policies and we will not criticize them in any way.
If you want to drive a wedge between the White House and the vice
president, forget it.''
   In the interview with foreign broadcasters, Reagan was asked
about Bush's apparent effort to distance himself from White House
policy on Noriega.
   ``I can see why the vice president said what he said,'' Reagan
said in the interview. ``Because the impression has been given,
based not on information from us, but based on rumors and news
leaks and so forth, that we are in negotiations over, with a
participant in the drug trade and all. And I think he was making
himself plain that you don't negotiate with people of that kind.''
   The president said his talks with Noriega were not about his
involvement in the drug trade.
   ``Our goal, what we're trying to achieve, is the restoration of
democracy in Panama,'' he said.

   NASA still hopes to launch the first
post-Challenger space shuttle in August, but the agency is
uncertain whether it can meet a goal of nine flights next year, the
head of the shuttle program says.
   The reason for the doubt is the explosion that destroyed the
Pacific Engineering and Production Co. plant in Henderson, Nev., on
May 4. The explosion eliminated the source of half the nation's
supply of a chemical used for the shuttle boosters and some other
rockets.
   A second plant in Henderson, owned by Kerr-McGee, has shut down
for inspections to see that it is safe. Pacific Engineering and
Kerr-McGee were the only American companies manufacturing ammonium
perchlorate, an oxidizer. The oxidizer makes sure the solid rocket
fuel burns evenly.
   Richard Truly, associate administrator for space flight of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said Thursday that
rocket-maker Morton Thiokol has enough ammonium perchlorate on hand
for four flights and there is enough on hand for a fifth rocket
set. The Titan 4 also uses ammonium perchlorate.
   The chemical, in the form of white crystals, is taken by rail
car to Morton Thiokol's plant in Utah, mixed there, and poured into
the segments that make the booster rockets.
   ``The issue will first come up in 1989, but we're not certain
there is going to be an impact in 1989 until we get together with
the DOD (Department of Defense) to match requirements and
availability,'' Truly said.
   He said NASA and the Air Force will have to decide how to divide
up the output of Kerr-McGee.
   He said the first post-Challenger flight still is on schedule
for launch in late August. He insisted the agency had not set a
firm date but is working toward a target of Aug. 22.
   Pacific Engineering said the explosion, which killed two people
and injured 326 was caused by a natural gas leak. Pacific
Engineering and Kerr-McGee each produced 30 million pounds per year
of ammonium perchlorate.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said the company hasn't
ruled out buying ammonium perchlorate from foreign firms but added:
``The rest of the world supply is pretty meager. I've seen
estimates of worldwide production of nine million pounds a year.''
   A pair of shuttle booster rockets uses 1.5 million pounds of
ammonium perchlorate per flight.

<HEAD>Administration Wary of Giving Military Drug-Arrest Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's spokesman says the
administration is wary of giving military personnel
drug-trafficking arrest powers because ``you cross an enormous
bridge when you move them'' to an enforcement role.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Thursday did not directly oppose a
bill passed overwhelmingly by the Senate to allow the Navy to make
arrests on the high seas, but he said the administration is ``very
cautious in that area.''
   ``I think the American people would want us to be cautious,''
Fitzwater said. ``But that does not diminish the idea that there
are expanded roles for the military.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, oppose attempts by Congress
to substantially change a military role which now consists
primarily of surveillance.
   Fitzwater was asked about a change Reagan made in a speech
Wednesday on the subject. The prepared remarks had called for
Reagan to say he had directed Carlucci to search for ``creative
solutions on how we can better use military resources and
technologies to detect and interdict drugs coming into this
country.''
   But when he actually delivered the speech, Reagan changed that
line to say he wanted Carlucci to find better ways for the military
``to detect drugs and support civil law enforcement agencies in
interdiction.''
   Asked about the significance of the change, Fitzwater said,
``There is a very great concern about what it means to make law
enforcement officers out of the military.''
   ``You cross an enormous bridge when you move them from providing
military support and surveillance and physical interdiction efforts
to making arrests and legal judgments and so forth,'' he said.
   ``As I think it was, Dan (Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard) the
other day said, `The first time an F-15 shoots down a dentist
because his (airplane) radio doesn't work, you begin to understand
the dimensions of the problem.''
   The chamber last Friday voted 83-6 for an amendment outlining a
wide-ranging anti-drug role for the military.
   The proposal calls for more surveillance by Air Force and Navy
planes, increased anti-drug activity by the National Guard and more
Pentagon helicopters for the Coast Guard and Customs Service.
   The most controversial provision would require Navy vessels to
track suspected drug boats and would allow Navy officers to arrest
suspected drug traffickers in international waters. The officers
would be temporarily ``deputized'' by Coast Guard officers who
would be aboard for that purpose.
   Fitzwater, however, likened the drug trade to ``a 30-foot tidal
wave hitting a 25-foot wall'' and said, ``The fact is that
interdiction is never going to solve the problem without cutting
the demand.''

<HEAD>Reagan Considers Gorbachev a Friend Despite Disagreements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says he considers Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev a friend as well as an adversary and
says the West should applaud whatever reforms Gorbachev can achieve.
   Reagan also says he believes ``it is evident'' Gorbachev is
encountering opposition from forces ``who want to cling to what are
more the Stalinist policies'' of yesteryear.
   Providing a rare insight to the private talks the two have had
in recent years, Reagan told foreign broadcasters Thursday that
strains in superpower relations have not harmed their personal
relationship.
   Asked if he considered Gorbachev a friend, Reagan replied,
``Well, I can't help but say yes to that. ... Yes, we can debate
and we disagree. But there is never a sense of personal animus when
the arguments are over.''
   While Reagan has challenged Gorbachev to prove that his
``glasnost'' campaign of openness is genuine, he said the West
should encourage the move toward change in the Soviet Union.
   ``If there's any way that outside nations could be helpful in
this, they should,'' he said, ``because many of the reforms that he
has undertaken are aimed at the things that we have always
criticized in the Soviet Union.
   ``And if there is a way to be helpful in that, certainly, to at
least acknowledge our approval of what he is doing, that we should
do that.''
   Reagan's obliging tone came on a day in which the president
continued to receive briefings in preparation for his May 29-June 2
summit with Gorbachev in Moscow.
   The president also made these points in a wide-ranging interview:
   _``I believe there is a desire in the Middle East to settle once
and for all what is still technically a state of war between the
Arab nations and Israel.''
   He said the purpose of an international peace conference would
be to aid the parties but not to ``dictate a settlement'' and said
any Soviet role in such a conference would likely have to be
preceded by a Kremlin decision to resume relations with Israel.
   _He hopes that Gorbachev ``has heard some of the things that I
have been saying'' about former White House chief of staff Donald
T. Regan's accusation that astrology played a role in official
business, saying that ``no decision was ever made by me on the
basis of astrology.''
   _Clandestine sales of U.S. arms to elements in Iran during parts
of 1985 and 1986 were aimed at bringing about the release of
hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists, but he claimed
that they did not amount to an arms-for-hostages deal.
   ``I've labored under the misapprehension here _ well, worldwide,
I guess _ about the so-called Iran-Contra affair,'' he said.
   ``I've likened it to, if I had a child that was kidnapped, I
don't think that you should pay ransom. But if I found there was
another individual that could get that child back for me in return
for my doing something for him, that would be all right.''
   On superpower relations and arms control, Reagan said he thinks
it is possible that a long-range missile treaty can be negotiated
before he leaves office because Gorbachev might not want to wait
for a new administration.
   While acknowledging that ``none of us really think'' such a
strategic missile deal could be completed at the coming summit in
Moscow, he said he did not think Gorbachev necessarily wants to
take his time.
   He said ``we're working as hard as we can, and it's a far more
complex treaty than the INF'' (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces)
treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev last December.
   ``But I think that it is possible that we could have that, yes,
while this administration is still here.''
   The president said he thinks the atmosphere for arms control has
improved in recent years, in part because of the nuclear reactor
accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine.
   ``Possibly, in the Soviet Union, it was their tragic experience
with Chernobyl, and to see that how an area was made unlivable for
the people that had lived all their lives there,'' he said. ``And
when you stop and think, that that explosion was less than the
power of one single warhead.''

<TEXT>
   Just a few weeks ago, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega seemed to be another hapless dictator teetering on the
brink, about to suffer the same fate as Haiti's Jean Claude
Duvalier and the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos.
   But not only has the Panamanian strongman survived, he also has
been an unsettling presence on the U.S. political scene, causing
George Bush to break with established policy and producing a degree
of interagency turmoil which is unusual even by this
administration's contentious standards.
   At times, administration bureaucrats seem angrier with each
other than with Noriega.
   Ideas aired within the administration and the Congress on how to
deal with Noriega have gone from one extreme to the other:
   Why not kidnap him? How about a trade embargo against Panama?
Let Noriega think the United States will invade; maybe that will
scare him into exile. Since Noriega is not inclined to listen to
the United States, perhaps other Latin American governments can
talk him into stepping down.
   Almost nothing has gone right. The State Department, after being
accused of winking at Noriega's alleged drug smuggling activities
for years, found itself on the defensive when its efforts to remove
him came up short.
   Noriega even has Bush turning on the administration these days.
Bush said Wednesday that, if elected, he would not ``bargain with
drug dealers ... whether they are on U.S. or foreign soil'' _ an
implied criticism of government attempts to use dismissal of drug
smuggling indictments to get Noriega out of power.
   Bush seems intent on not allowing the Democrats to outflank him
on the drug issue. His comment followed polls showing him trailing
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis and a Senate vote that
reflected strong opposition to lettin indicted drug smugglers off
the hook.
   Meanwhile, State Department officials are angry with Justice
Department counterparts who leaked details of the secret
negotiations with Noriega last week. And Pentagon officials accuse
the State Department of coming up with ``harebrained schemes'' for
an anti-Noriega plot that included use of U.S. military forces.
   When White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater outlined a portion
of the State Department negotiating position two weeks ago,
department officials exploded, venting their anger not so much at
the spokesman but at whoever authorized him to go public.
   This has not been an easy time for the administration. But Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., says the critics should withhold their fire
until they can come up with some workable ideas of their own for
dealing with Noriega.
   Almost everyone agrees the administration erred last February in
leaving the impression that Noriega would soon leave. As far back
as seven weeks ago, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams was
saying that Noriega was clinging to power ``by his fingernails.''
   Yet Noriega survives, forcing the administration to make one
concession after another in negotiations with him.
   Initially, the administration was determined to try to force him
out without promising not to extradite him once he left Panama.
Dismissing the indictments was out of the question.
   As the weeks passed, the administration retreated steadily,
first assuring Noriega he would not be extradited, then offering to
drop the indictments, then, reportedly, offering to let him return
to Panama after a post-resignation period in exile.
   All this has been a blow to the administration's prestige,
partially erasing the memory of its 1986 successes in Haiti and the
Philippines when Duvalier and Marcos fled under U.S. pressure.
   Some, including a Pentagon expert on Latin America, Nestor
Sanchez, had warned that Noriega could not be toppled so easily.
After all, unlike Duvalier and Marcos, Noriega was commander of his
country's defense forces; as long as they remained loyal, he
stayed, even if Panama's economy collapsed, Sanchez correctly
argued.
   But the conventional wisdom in the administration last February
was quite different. The combination of U.S. pressure and the
strong anti-Noriega sentiment in Panama was certain to topple him,
or so it was thought.
   There was another seemingly favorable portent. What appeared to
be the most serious blow against Noriega _ the abortive bid by
President Eric Arturo Delvalle to fire him _ occurred on Feb. 25,
the second anniversary of Ferdinand Marcos' escape to exile from
the Philippines.
   But while Marcos languishes in gloomy exile in Hawaii, Noriega
continues to call the shots in Panama, protected by his
U.S.-trained military backers.

   President Reagan took a turn as a candid
camera narrator, saying insider books on his presidency compelled a
fanciful reply from ``the ultimate insider.''
   Attending his last White House Photographers Association dinner,
Reagan had hundreds of photographers, camera crews and an array of
news celebrities roaring Thursday night with deadpan captions for a
series of pictures projected on three huge screens in a hotel
ballroom.
   Reagan noted the recent spate of tell-all books on his
administration and told his audience that ``I've had it with all of
that. Tonight, I'm going to give it to you from the ultimate
insider.''
   Standing in one picture alongside Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Reagan said he was explaining to his guest: `You have to
understand, Mikhail, if Domino's doesn't get the pizza here in 30
minutes, we get it free.''
   In another slide, Reagan was shown standing in the Oval Office
and looking on as Gorbachev leaned over a table to put his
signature in a book.
   ``I even made him write a hundred times, `I will not cheat. I
will not cheat,''' the president told the group gathered in a
ballroom of the Sheraton Washington Hotel.
   ``I like Mikhail, but you have to watch him,'' he added.
   Another slide showed Reagan sitting in a bathrobe in his
Bethesda Naval Hospital room with several aides, including
then-Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan.
   Reagan is laughing heartily in the picture, and the president
provided this caption: ``So, Don Regan, you say you're going to
write a book?''
   Reagan said he enthusiastically supports Vice President George
Bush's run for the White House. Then, showing a picture in which he
is stifling a yawn and first lady Nancy has both her hands raised
beside her face, Reagan said, ``There we are, listening to one of
his speeches.''
   In a picture of a meeting with some people in the Oval Office, a
young boy was acting up in the foreground. Reagan said the
youngster must have just ``had a vision of Michael Dukakis in the
Oval Office.''
   In another slide, Reagan was shown wearing an earphone headset,
with Secretary of State George Shultz sitting next to him.
``Somebody along the way planted bugs,'' the president explained.
   Describing another picture in which he was shown peering over
sandbags while sitting next to a soldier, Reagan said the GI asked
him, ``Where's the next book coming from?''
   On a more serious note, Reagan saluted the photographers, saying
``you've been there with me. You've captured me in moments of hope
... moments of disappointment, and moments of grief.
   ``You've captured what life has meant for me and Nancy over the
last eight years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Central Bank Governor Resigns; Economic Outlook Grim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUDDY L. GONZALEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governor of the
Central Bank has resigned in the face of mounting economic
pressures in this Caribbean nation, where inflation has soared to
50 percent.
   Robert Saladin gave no explanation for his action Thursday. The
economist appeared briefly at the National Palace, the seat of
government, to deliver a letter of resignation to the government of
President Joaquin Balaguer.
   Saladin, 50, has disagreed with some of Balaguer's solutions for
stimulating the economy in this nation of 6.5 million people.
   ``Unfortunately, I am not a politician and I cannot be in these
political fights,'' Saladin said in a brief interview at the
National Palace.
   By late afternoon, the government had made no comment nor named
a replacement.
   Saladin is the second Central Bank governor to resign since
Balaguer was elected in May 1986. Luis Julian Perez quit in
November after suggesting that repayments on the Dominican
Republic's $4 billion debt be limited to 10 percent of export
earnings.
   Last year, debt repayments amounted $750 million, or more than
the value of total exports.
   Saladin has chafed at Balaguer's policy to stimulate the economy
by pumping $600 million into public works. About 210,000 jobs have
been created and economic growth is projected at 8 percent this
year, but there have been unwelcome side-effects.
   Inflation has soared to 50 percent, private economists estimate.
The foreign exchange value of the peso has dropped by about 20
percent to 19 cents since late last year.
   Residents of the capital Santo Domingo clashed in February with
police during demonstrations to protest increases in the cost of
living and the scarcity of basic goods like milk and cement. Public
employees demanded and received an increase in the minimum wage.

   A college business group says 50 of the
wealthiest American universities lost 13.1 percent of their
endowments in the last quarter of 1987 as a result of the stock
market crash.
   By comparison, common stocks overall dropped 22.6 percent during
the final three months of 1987, as measured by the Standard and
Poor's 500, the National Association of College and University
Business Officers said Thursday.
   The group, which has tracked endowments since 1974, said the
downturn came after an excellent year for the campus funds,
including a gain of nearly 25 percent in the stock market during
the 12 months that ended on June 30, 1987.
   The typical campus had little more than half its endowment
invested in stocks. The overall return on their holdings in the
1986-87 academic year was 13.9 percent, the business officers said.
   In arriving at the 13.9 percent figure, the association used
data supplied by 296 colleges and universities with endowments
ranging from $1.5 million for Indiana University of Pennsylvania to
$4 billion for Harvard.
   The market value of the endowments of all 296 institutions was
$47.9 billion at mid-year. The report did not provide a cumulative
figure for after the crash.
   There are more than 3,000 colleges and universities in the
United States. The association study covers most of those with
endowments of $1 million or more.
   While the group normally reports trends from July of one year
through June of the next, it commissioned a special analysis by
Cambridge Associates on the impact of the Oct. 19 stock market
crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 industrial
stocks fell 508 points.
   ``The October 1987 stock market tumble caused 50 college and
university endowments of $100 million or more to fall an average of
13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of the calendar year,'' said the
study, reported in the May issue of Business Officer, an
association magazine.
   After ``the market meltdown,'' those 50 universities engaged in
a ``modest repositioning,'' it said. The 50 were not named, and no
figures were given on where their endowments stood after the tumble.
   Between Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, their asset allocations went from
63 percent to 57 percent stocks, from 27 percent to 32 percent
bonds and from 10 percent to 11 percent cash.
   At mid-year, among all 296 colleges and universities, the
average investment pool was composed of 54.2 percent stocks, 29.4
percent bonds, 12.7 percent cash and equivalents, 1.9 percent real
estate and 1.8 percent other assets.
   Ten endowments were worth $1 billion or more last summer. They
were: Harvard, $4.02 billion; University of Texas system, $2.8
billion; Princeton, $2.3 billion; Yale, $2.1 billion; Stanford,
$1.7 billion; Columbia, $1.4 billion; Texas A&M University system,
$1.21 billion; Washington University, $1.2 billion; Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, $1.17 billion; and the University of
California, $1.12 billion.

<HEAD>Lamb Consumption Rises, But Only Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheep producers have fared better the last
year or so, but an Agriculture Department report says lamb chops
are still a long way from being at the top of the menu.
   Lamb consumption may edge up in 1988 after declining over the
last 20 years. But don't trade for a sheep ranch just yet.
   ``In the first place, the slight increase in prospective
consumption, from 1.3 pounds per capita to 1.4, does not mean that
(producers) can look forward to any sustained recovery in consumer
demand,'' the report said.
   By comparison, 1988 per capita consumption of beef is expected
to be 72.1 pounds, retail weight; pork, 62.7 pounds; and veal, 1.5
pounds. The USDA's forecast for poultry consumption this year is
82.9 pounds per capita.
   The report, largely the work of Richard Stillman of the
department's Economic Research Service, was prepared for the June
issue of Farmline magazine, which is published each month by the
agency.
   ``While retailers will find buyers for the additional
quantities, selling prices are likely to fall, reducing incentives
for a major rebuilding of the nation's sheep herd,'' the report
said. ``The buying habits of consumers and the abundance of other
red meats and poultry will probably exert some downward pressure on
prices, and so keep lamb production and consumption from rising
substantially.''
   Lamb is a staple in the Middle East, parts of Europe, Australia
and New Zealand but has never been one of the more popular meats
for Americans.
   ``Eating habits are established early in life, and those who
don't grow up eating lamb are less likely to develop a taste for it
later,'' the report said.
   Americans each consumed an average of 4.2 pounds of lamb in
1960, but the per capita rate has declined by two-thirds,
reflecting the downward thrust of the U.S. sheep industry. At the
turn of the century, the U.S. sheep herd was around 48 million
head. Now, it's fewer than 11 million.
   Even so, the department's Jan. 1 inventory report showed 4
percent gain from a year earlier, a response to the improved prices
of recent years.
   Stillman said that with production catching up, lamb market
prices are unlikely to rebound to the peaks of 1986 or last year's
average of $78 per 100 pounds. Continued high production levels and
supplies of other red meats and poultry will also dampen gains in
the lamb market.
   The average price of lamb may be in the range of $74 and $77 per
hundredweight this year. Although lower, that would still be high
enough to ensure producers a healthy return, he said.
   In 1987, for example, with lambs averaging $78 per
hundredweight, producers made about $42 per ewe, according to
agency estimates, Stillman said.
   One of the problems for producers is a scarcity of plants that
slaughter and process lambs. Most facilities that kill more than
100,000 lambs a year are in the Midwest and West. While a high
percentage of the nation's sheep are in those areas, producers in
other regions must absorb transportation costs when their lambs go
to slaughter.
   Two years ago, a large poultry firm which also processes lamb
opened a plant in Harrisonburg, Va., in an attempt to fill the
needs of the East Coast restaurant trade.
   ``But the firm stopped slaughtering last year because farms in
the region could not provide enough lambs, and animals had to be
shipped in from the West,'' Stillman said.
   Predators, including coyotes and wild or roaming dogs, also have
helped keep down lamb production in many areas, he said.

   The Agriculture Department says farmers have
signed up to take 54.2 million acres of cropland from production in
1988, down 10 percent from 59.9 million acres idled in 1987.
   Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1988 idled
acreage would represent an area larger than the state of Kansas or
Nebraska.
   To be eligible for federal price supports and related benefits,
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base from crop
production and put the land into conservation uses that help
protect the soil.
   The idled or ``diverted'' acres signed up for in 1988 under the
commodity programs included: corn, 20.9 million acres, down from 23
million acres last year; sorghum, 4.1 million, up from 4 million;
barley, 2.9 million, unchanged; oats, 300,000, down from 800,000;
and total feed grains, 28.2 million acres, down from 30.7 million
in 1987.
   Wheat farmers signed up to idle 22.8 million acres this year,
down from 23.8 million in 1987; cotton, 2.1 million acres, down
from 3.8 million; and rice, 1.1 million acres, down from 1.6
million.
   The USDA report said Thursday that farmers enrolled 187.8
million acres of feed grain, wheat, cotton, and rice in the 1988
acreage program, which represented 83.4 percent of the 225.2
million base acres in the program crops. Last year's enrollment
made up 86.5 percent of the 1987 base of 226.4 million acres.

<HEAD>Shoppers Concern Over Nutrition Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More women than men say they are very
concerned about eating the right foods, and old people are more
concerned than any other age group, a survey on American shoppers
reports.
   The annual survey of shoppers by the Food Marketing Institute, a
nonprofit association representing the food industry, found
``dynamic increases'' in customer awareness of health issues such
as fat, salt and sugar content.
   In the survey in January of 1,019 shoppers, 58 percent of the
women said they were very concerned about nutrition, compared with
48 percent of men.
   Some 59 percent of people without children said they were very
concerned about nutrition, compared with 52 percent of those who
had children at home.
   The share who said they were very concerned about nutrition was
largest among senior citizens, at 72 percent of people aged 65 and
over. Those aged 18 to 24 showed the least interest, 33 percent
being very concerned.
   The share very concerned about nutrition peaked in the South at
60 percent, followed by 56 percent in the West, 54 percent in the
East and 52 percent in the Midwest.
   ``People are remarkably knowledgeable and sophisticated about
health and nutrition issues,'' Tim Hammonds, a vice president of
the Food Marketing Institute, said Thursday. They are adjusting
their diets, doing less frying and more broiling of foods, seeking
more fresh fruits, he said.
   Some 27 percent of supermarket shoppers said they are concerned
about fat in their foods, up from 16 percent just a year ago and 9
percent in 1983, the institute said.
   And worry about cholesterol jumped eight points from 14 percent
to 22 percent in the past year, the institute said. It rated 5
percent in 1983.
   ``I think the important thing is that the numbers are
increasing. ... It shows more and more people are learning that
fatty foods can contribute to heart disease, obesity and possibly
colon and breast cancer,'' said Bonnie F. Liebman, nutrition
director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
consumer-oriented health advocacy group.
   ``More and more people have gotten the message that they should
cut back on fat, but ... people need help translating principles
into breakfast, lunch and dinner,'' she said.
   Liebman urged food manufacturers to provide clearer labeling,
with guidance such as ``high, low or medium'' fat, in addition to
the actual measurement.
   However, consumer concern doesn't necessarily translate into
action.
   Just last week Prevention magazine's annual health study
disclosed that 54 percent of people polled said they were trying to
reduce the fat in their diets, a decline from 56 percent a year
earlier.
   Even so, Hammonds stressed that the food industry is responding
to consumer concerns.
   In recent years farmers have begun raising leaner hogs than in
the past, markets are trimming more of the fat from meats and
offering leaner meat cuts, and the government has changed grading
standards to make leaner meats more attractive, he pointed out.
   Indeed, a coalition of more than a dozen consumer health groups
is expected to release a study shortly praising major food
manufacturers and restaurant chains for reducing their use of
saturated fats.
   While more than one-quarter of shoppers expressed concern about
fat, the institute found that as many as half said they turned to
labels for information on these and other ingredients.
   Some 46 percent of shoppers said they looked on food labels for
fat and protein content of foods.
   Other topics gaining attention of consumers included ``freshness
and purity,'' up 7 points from last year to 15 percent saying they
are concerned.
   Salt and sugar each gained 4 percentage points, to 26 percent
and 20 percent respectively. Worry about preservatives was up 2
points to 16 percent and chemical additives rose 1 point to 14
percent.
   Concern about vitamin content was unchanged at 21 percent, as
was the 14 percent rating for calories.
   The findings were reported in the Institute's 1988 edition of
``Trends: Consumer Attitudes & The Supermarket.'' The margin of
error for the sample generally ranges between 2 and 3 percentage
points.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary May Be Helping Bush With Economic Engineering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is looking to a powerful ally on
Pennsylvania Avenue for help in seeing that his most valuable
campaign asset, the current 65-month economic recovery, will last
at least until Election Day.
   The ally is not President Reagan but a political supporter who
occupies the building next door, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III. And some economists contend Baker may be giving the vice
president more than just advice.
   Treasury officials won't comment on the speculation, but some
economists point to recent activity in international markets as
evidence that Baker has been leaning hard on major U.S. trading
partners to help elect Bush and other Republicans.
   These actions include recent intervention in currency markets by
other central banks and heavy foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities, particularly by Japanese investors _ measures that can
help stabilize the shaky dollar, minimize inflation and help keep
the economy on an even keel.
   A leading proponent of such a view is David Hale, chief
economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. He cites the
spending of huge sums by Japan and other countries to stabilize the
dollar, at prices higher than investors are willing to pay, as a
form of ``political insurance'' for Bush.
   Foreign allies ``don't want to see a big discontinuity in U.S.
economic policies. It's not so much that they're against Dukakis
and for Bush. They just want stability in the United States in an
election year,'' Hale said in an interview.
   ``Two years ago, Washington wanted a lower dollar. Now
Washington wants a strong dollar, at least until the election.
Because Baker is fearful that a dollar decline could lead to
another stock market crash,'' Hale said.
   Although a weak dollar can help ease the trade deficit by making
U.S. goods more competitive, it can also reignite inflation and
drive foreign investors away from Treasury securities and other
dollar-based investments, threatening the financing of the
government's huge budget deficit.
   Foreign-exchange reserves held by the world's central banks last
year grew to $790 billion from $559 billion, and Hale estimates
that two-thirds of this increase comes from efforts by central
banks to support the dollar.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly has earmarked another $60 billion
to spend this year to help prop up the dollar against the yen,
after expanding its foreign-exchange holdings by $40 billion in
1987.
   At the same time, foreign investors have become the single
largest buyer of Treasury securities. This helps underwrite the
U.S. budget deficit, since selling Treasury bonds and bills is the
government's primary way of financing its red ink spending.
   Analysts estimate that Japanese investors alone bought as much
as half of last week's sale of $8.5 billion in new 30-year Treasury
bonds. Analysts have speculated that the government of Japan
persuaded them to do so, perhaps as a favor to Baker.
   If Japanese and other foreign investors were to withdraw their
stake in Treasury securities, interest rates would be forced up
sharply, possibly triggering a recession.
   An economic downturn at this point could spell disaster for
Bush's presidential efforts.
   And while most economists don't see a recession likely in the
months ahead, many forecasters are expressing new fears about an
escalation in both inflation and interest rates.
   Bush has been wielding the recovery _ a peacetime record _ as a
major campaign weapon. While he scoffed at Reagan's policies as
``voodoo economics'' in 1980, he now regularly extols them on
campaign stops as the ``American miracle.''
   The similarity in phrasing to the ``Massachusetts miracle''
trumpeted by Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis is no
coincidence.
   Bush strategists claim the vice president will launch a major
assault on Dukakis' claim after the party conventions this summer,
seeking to demonstrate that the job-creation claimed by Dukakis as
governor is merely an outgrowth of Reagan-Bush economic policies.
   However, for the strategy to work, the economy must continue to
perform vigorously in the months to come.
   Last week's report that the U.S. trade deficit shrank by $4
billion between February and March provided some needed
market-driven stimulus to the ailing dollar. However stock and bond
markets slumped as investors worried that rising U.S. exports
without an accompanying reduction in imports could fan inflation.
   Baker is an early Bush supporter and is expected at some point
to assume a key role in managing Bush's general election campaign.
Baker said Thursday, ``For now I'm staying at the Treasury
Department.''
   Bush lieutenants have suggested that, at least for the time
being, Baker may be more useful to Bush there.
   ``It may be more prudent to seek his advice as a Cabinet
member'' rather than bringing him into the campaign, said Bush's
staff chief Craig Fuller.
   Treasury officials refused to comment on allegations that Baker
was using his influence to try to persuade Japanese, West German
and other governments to take steps that would promote an economic
environment conducive to a Bush victory.
   But one official, who demanded anonymity, said that trying to
keep the United States out of a recession does not exactly run
contrary to Baker's role as Treasury secretary _ regardless of
which candidate it might help.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Not All Hill Testimony Was Protected By Immunity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key admissions to Congress by former national
security adviser John Poindexter and Oliver L. North about the
Iran-Contra affair could be used against them in court despite
immunity grants, prosecutors say.
   The prosecutors contend that hundreds of statements by
Poindexter, fired National Security Council aide North, and arms
dealer Albert Hakim during last year's hearings are not covered by
the limited grants of immunity they received from the congressional
Iran-Contra committees.
   These statements include Poindexter's admission that he approved
North's idea to help finance the Nicaraguan rebels with profits
from the U.S.-Iran arms sales and didn't tell President Reagan in
order to give him ``some future deniability'' if the operation were
exposed.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh contended in a court
filing Thursday that he could also use statements by North and
Poindexter that they destroyed documents during the November 1986
investigation that Attorney General Edwin Meese III conducted after
the arms-for-hostage deals became public.
   Walsh made the legal claim in a filing in U.S. District Court on
the issue of whether his investigation was tainted by exposure of
prosecutors and grand jurors to the immunized testimony of the
three defendants.
   The three are accused of conspiring with retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord to defraud the government by diverting
arms-sale profits to the Contras and obstructing inquiries by
Congress and Meese about the operation.
   The indictment includes charges that Poindexter and North made
false statements to Congress by denying their involvement in the
private network supplying the Contras and destroyed evidence during
Meese's probe.
   Secord, who was Hakim's business partner, testified on Capitol
Hill without an immunity grant.
   The so-called ``use immunity'' bars Walsh from using an
individual defendant's compelled congressional testimony as
evidence against that person.
   But in a brief filed by special counsel Herbert J. Stern, the
independent counsel contended that many answers by the three
defendants fell outside the immunity grant because they were
volunteered.
   ``Volunteered testimony by defendants in their congresional
testimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trial
against them,'' said Stern, who was retained to handle the immunity
issues.
   Walsh offered to ``forgo the use of congressional testimony'' as
direct evidence against the defendants if the court would dispose
of the immunity issue.
   But the prosecution cited hundreds of examples of congressional
testimony it contends could be used as evidence against the
defendants.
   ``The transcripts reveal that the defendants intended to answer
questions that were not asked, to volunteer information that they
wished to disclose, and to go beyond any fair reading of many of
the questions that were asked,'' the brief said.
   Supreme Court decisions ``clearly demonstrate that defendants
may not turn an immunity grant into a license to volunteer
information to bar prosecution,'' the independent counsel said.
   The defense, in a separate filing, called the claim ``simply
absurd.''
   ``Each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset and
never relinquished it,'' lawyers for North, Poindexter and Hakim
said in a joint filing. ``The court should flatly reject the IC's
(independent counsel's) attempt to circumvent the immunity
statute.''
   Defense lawyers also urged the judge to dismiss the indictment
on the ground that Walsh took insufficient steps to isolate his
staff from the defendants' immunized testimony, which ``has seeped
into every corner of this case.''
   But the independent counsel defended his procedures, arguing
that the defense had failed to show that the investigation had
illegally relied on immunized testimony.
   Walsh urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to set a trial
date, arguing that the defense request for further proceedings on
the immunity issue amounted to ``a transparent attempt at delay.''

<HEAD>Impeachment Panel Seeks Testimony From Convicted Hastings Friend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House impeachment panel is seeking crucial
testimony from a closemouthed Washington lawyer who was convicted
in 1982 of arranging a bribe for federal judge Alcee L. Hastings
from two Miami racketeers.
   William A. Borders, a prominent criminal lawyer, was among the
witnesses summoned to testify before the House Judiciary
subcommittee on criminal justice when it resumes impeachment
proceedings against Hastings next week.
   But there was no assurance that Borders will break his silence
on the case. Borders previously has refused to testify against
Hastings, his close friend, and never testified at his or Hastings'
trials.
   The subcommittee, which will meet again on Tuesday, is eager to
ask Borders the critical question of whether Hastings was ever
aware that his friend was arranging a $150,000 bribe for him.
   Hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with Borders to
solicit the bribe from the two convicted racketeers, Frank and Tom
Romano, in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences.
   The subcommittee is investigating charges by a special
five-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta that Hastings actually took part in the bribery scheme and
tried to conceal his involvement by lying under oath and
fabricating evidence at his trial.
   When FBI agents arrested Borders in his car outside a suburban
Arlington, Va., hotel in October 1981 _ hours before an evening
boating party to have been held by fellow lawyers in Borders' honor
_ they found a garment bag stuffed with $125,000 in cash on the
front seat.
   The money had just been delivered to Borders as the final bribe
payment by an undercover FBI agent who sat in the car posing as
Frank Romano.
   Another Hastings friend, Hemphill Pride, testified Thursday that
when he told the judge of Borders' arrest later that day, ``he was
shocked, he looked like his mouth went dry, he couldn't believe it
happened.''
   Hastings then hurriedly left Washington to return to Florida.
The judicial investigative panel concluded that Hastings fled
``because he knew he was criminally involved with Borders in the
Romano bribery scheme.''
   His fellow judges, in a 381-page report on the affair, said
Hastings boarded a flight from an airport near Baltimore instead of
Washington ``because he wanted to avoid being interviewed by the
FBI.''
   The results of the 3{-year judicial investigation were outlined
by New York lawyer John Doar, a former assistant U.S. attorney
general and special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during
the Watergate impeachment proceedings against President Nixon in
1974.
   Doar said the appellate panel had uncovered evidence not
available to the trial jury that Hastings had given false testimony
about a series of telephone calls and had drafted phony letters
intended to obscure his alleged involvement in the bribery
conspiracy.
   Under questioning by House investigators, Doar said he had found
no evidence of any racial motivation behind Hastings' prosecution
or the subsequent inquiry by the judicial panel.
   If the subcommittee recommends impeachment, and the full
Judiciary Committee concurs, the House must vote whether to impeach
Hastings. Then the Senate would conduct a trial. A two-thirds
majority vote of the Senate is required for conviction and removal
from office.

<HEAD>Group Says 175 Parks Threatened by Development</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new coalition of preservationists says
national parks across the country face threats from commercial
development similar to a plan by a Virginia company to build a
shopping mall next to the Manassas National Battlefield.
   ``At 175 parks, the threat is so significant that the reason the
park was established may be lost,'' Paul Pritchard, one of the
founders of the National Heritage Coalition, said Thursday.
   Pritchard said other endangered parks include Richmond and
Fredericksburg-Spotsylvania in Virginia; Gettysburg, Pa.; the
Everglades National Park in Florida; and Olympic National Park in
Washington.
   At a press conference, Pritchard and other opponents of the
Manassas shopping mall announced their intention to stop it and any
other project that endangers a historic site.
   President Carter's former press secretary, Jody Powell, is
helping the group free of charge with public relations and
organized the gathering.
   The coalition _ sponsored by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation and the National Parks and Conservation Association _
is calling for Congress to enact legislation giving the federal
government power to halt development temporarily so that
negotiation, compromise or federal acquisition of disputed property
can take place.
   As part of its project to protect the Manassas battlefield, the
coalition is working for passage of a bill recently introduced by
Reps. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, and Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., that
directs the Interior Secretary to acquire the land now owned by
developers.
   Meanwhile, bulldozing is under way to prepare for townhouses and
detached homes that will accompany the shopping mall. Bob Kelly,
spokesman for the developer, Hazel-Peterson Co., said nothing can
stop construction short of an act of Congress.
   The acreage in question includes the site where Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee directed troops for the second battle of Manassas and
includes land used for hospital space and as a burial ground for
some of the war dead.
   Though the land has been part of a master plan for expanding the
4,500-acre park since 1935, it never was acquired by the federal
government and Hazel-Peterson bought it about three years ago for
$10 million.
   The Interior Department is promoting a compromise in which the
developer would move the mall so it is not visible from the park.
   The plan is acceptable to Hazel-Peterson, but not the

<HEAD>US Funds Monitoring Commission, Blasts Sandinistas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has approved $10
million to monitor compliance with the Nicaraguan peace process,
drawing congressional criticism for taking so long to decide how to
use the money.
   The money was part of a $48 million package approved by Congress
in late March, a week after Nicaragua's leftist government and the
Contra rebels signed a temporary truce at Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   That agreement called for the creation of a verification
commission to monitor compliance with the accord.
   Of the funds, $8 million will go for activities of Joao Baena
Soares, secretary general of the Organization of American States,
and $2 million for Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, leader of the
Nicaraguan Roman Catholic Church.
   The allocations are based on a budget submitted by the
commission to which the two men belong.
   Shortly after the grant was announced, House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, criticized the administration for taking six weeks to
determine how to spend the funds. Other Democrats have made the
same criticism.
   Money for the verification commission had been held up because
the State Department and the OAS were unable to agree on a proposal
that met U.S. goverment accounting requirements.
   This drew an angry reaction from Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who
said that U.S. officials were demanding an elaborate accounting
system from the OAS on the one hand while, on the other, they were
giving money to the Contras and letting it ``simply disappear into
the jungle.''
   In announcing the grant, the administration launched a harsh
attack on the Sandinista government.
   The administrator of the Agency for International Development,
Alan Woods, charged that Nicaragua had engaged in a campaign of
``harassment and intimidation'' and ``menacing militarism'' in
apparent violation of agreements signed by Sandinista authorities.
   Alan Woods said in letters to Baena Soares and Obando y Bravo:
``Anyone who shares our interest in peace, democracy and
reconciliation in Nicaragua must be greatly alarmed by the recent
crackdown on human rights and civil liberties by the Sandinista
government.''
   ``This barrage of harassment and intimidation makes it clear
that the verification commission must fully monitor the very
fundamental issues of democracy, civil liberties and human rights.''
   Woods told the commission members that a series of incidents in
recent weeks has undermined ``the process of reconciliation to
which the Nicaraguan government committed itself.''
   He said the process is being further scuttled by the Nicaraguan
government's ``menacing militarism.'' He cited a statement by
Nicaraguan Defense Minister Humberto Ortega in which he threatened
the Contras with ``actions on a scale never before seen in this
war.''
   Woods also said Nicaraguan authorities have placed severe
limitations on press freedom and that more than 30 persons
supporting construction workers conducting a hunger strike were
arrested.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras are attempting to negotiate a
permanent settlement but have made little progress. The deadline
for reaching an agreement is June 1.

<HEAD>Baker Rules Out Sweeping Changes In World Monetary System</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release at 2:30 a.m. EDT, TIME set by source.</NOTE>
<HEAD>With PM-World Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The global economy is changing too rapidly for
governments to successfully impose major changes in the way they
manage exchange rates, U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III
said today.
   Baker said he favors gradual, step-by-step efforts to improve
coordination of monetary policy among the major industrialized
countries.
   He cited as an example a possible broadening of coordination on
national tax reform and deregulation of financial and labor
markets. The United States also could work more closely with its
major trading partners in monitoring the performance of their
economies, he said.
   But in remarks prepared for delivery to the Council on Foreign
Relations, Baker ruled out any ``sweeping, revolutionary changes in
the system.''
   His appearance before the council was closed to the news media.
Copies of his speech were made available in advance.
   Baker met on Wednesday and Thursday in Paris with trade and
finance ministers from the 24 members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
   ``An attempt to make an abrupt or major change in the structure
of the system by imposing a detailed set of formal constraints
might well be viewed by the markets as overly ambitious and
unsustainable,'' Baker said.
   ``The global economy is too dynamic, and the forces of change
too strong, to be able to look ahead with great certainty and
envision a highly defined international monetary structure that
will fit the world economy of 1995 as well as that of 2005,'' he
added.
   Baker told reporters after the OECD meeting Thursday that the
seven largest industrial countries were pleased with the relative
stability of exchange rates since last December, when they jointly
bought massive amounts of dollars in the open market in order to
halt its steep decline.
   ``We see no reason to believe that that won't continue,'' Baker
said.
   In his speech to the foreign relations group, Baker said the
major economic powers' efforts since 1985 to improve monetary
coordination had been a remarkable, although incomplete, success.
   ``I strongly suspect the world economy is better off today than
we would have been had we not followed this course,'' he said.
   Some government officials and private experts have said the
world monetary system should undergo more radical reforms than
suggested by Baker.
   A study published earlier this month by the Institute for
International Economics in Washington said existing international
agreements on ways of keeping exchange rates stable were
``agonizingly fragile.''
   The issue of reforms to the world monetary system is expected to
be discussed at a June 19-21 summit meeting in Tornoto of leaders
from the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy and Japan.

<HEAD>Committee Clears Bill To Strengthen Disclosure Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is expected to act quickly on
legislation requiring lenders to make full disclosure of what one
of the sponsors calls ``the potential pitfalls'' of home equity
loans.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a major sponsor of the bill, said
he expected it to become law rapidly after clearing the House
Banking Committee on Thursday by a unanimous voice vote. He noted
the Senate has already approved a similar, but less stringent,
measure.
   ``Home equity loans can be like a loaded pistol,'' said Schumer.
``Consumers need to beware or they can blow up in their face.''
   The legislation requires lenders to make full disclosure on home
equity loan accounts so that new applicants can know exactly what
it is they are applying for.
   Lenders would have to provide information on the annual interest
percentage rate, any fees associated with the loan, a series of
warnings about the risks involved and a description of repayment
options.
   ``With the passage of the ... bill, the committee is taking the
mystery out of the home equity loans and hopefully providing
consumers with a guide to the potential pitfalls of home equity
loans,'' he said.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
consumer affairs subcommittee which handled the bill, echoed the
sentiments of Schumer and other proponents of the legislation.
   ``This legislation enables consumers to know that home equity
loans have risks as well as benefits,'' Annunzio said. ``This
legislation will assure that they receive, at the time of
application, all the information necessary to make an informed
decision, whether to apply for such a loan.
   ``In addition, it will strictly limit areas which were
susceptible to abuse by the unilateral action of creditors.''
   The bill also provides for other consumer protections:
   -A prohibition on a creditor unilaterally changing the terms of
the loan contract.
   -Requiring the use of publicly available indexes outside the
control of the lender when the rate of interest varies.
   -Restrictions on the lender from calling in the loan before the
term of the loan.
   -A right to obtain a refund of application fees if the lender
changes the terms after an application is submitted but before the
account is opened.
   The committee's action was lauded by consumer organizations, but
the American Bankers Association said the ``disclosure and
advertising provisions are impractical. They will result in an
unnecessary overload of information for consumers, and they will
severely limit the creditors' ability to design informative
advertisements.''
   Home equity loans - a line of credit available to borrowers who
provide their homes as collateral - have grown more popular in
recent years, especially since interest on them is tax deductible
in most cases.
   Consumer groups report that home equity lending doubled between
1986 and 1987 from $40 billion to $80 billion.

<HEAD>Teamsters Accept Contract Although Truckers Voted Against It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters union accepted a new trucking
industry contract that was overwhelmingly rejected in rank-and-file
balloting, with a Teamsters official saying members who didn't vote
probably favored it.
   The union said Thursday that 64,101 truckers voted to turn down
the proposed three-year National Master Freight Agreement while
36,782 supported the new proposal.
   The 63.5 percent opposition vote fell short of the two-thirds
voting majority needed under Teamster bylaws to reject a contract
and authorize a strike. Under the union's constitution, 66.66
percent of those voting have to turn down a proposed contract or it
goes into effect automatically.
   ``Since the constitution requires that the final offer be
accepted as a result of failure to reject by two-thirds vote, any
strike or work stoppage will be a violation of the agreement and
have serious consequences,'' Jack Yager, chairman of the union
negotiating committee, said in a statement.
   Yager said over 57 percent of the ballots mailed out were not
returned. He maintained that it was likely the 80,000 members who
did not return ballots were satisfied with the final offer.
   ``If not, they would have cast ballots rejecting the contract,''
he said.
   The new contract provides annual 35-cents-an-hour wage gains
over the next three years to some 200,000 workers.
   The contract raises the base rate for truck drivers from the
current $14.71 an hour to $15.06 an hour retroactive to April 1.
This would be followed by similar 35-cent hourly raises in 1989 and
1990.
   The contract proved unpopular with union truck drivers because
of certain changes in work rules.
   Locals were upset over a provision of the agreement that would
require all Teamsters members at a trucking company that is losing
money to give back 15 percent of their pay in exchange for a
promised share of any future profits if 75 percent of the union
members vote to do so.
   Another provision could force drivers to pay for loss of freight
or for truck damage if their company proves gross negligence.

<HEAD>Studies Show Benefits Of Additional Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women with early stage breast cancer would
benefit from treatment in addition to initial surgery or radiation
therapy, the National Cancer Institute says, citing three studies
that have yet to be published.
   Such additional treatment _ chemotherapy or hormonal therapy or
both _ has been the institution's formal recommendation for the
past two years in cases involving more advanced breast cancer.
   The NCI announcement Thursday shows the institute views the new
findings significant enough to publicize before they are formally
published in a medical journal or presented at a scientific meeting.
   Women with early stage breast cancer _ before it has spread to
lymph nodes under the arm _ have been regarded as having a
relatively favorable prognosis after primary treatment, but it is
now recognized that up to 30 percent have recurrences of their
cancer, the NCI said.
   ``The richness of the clinical evidence from a variety of trials
now shows that this outlook can be improved upon,'' NCI Director
Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr. said.
   The data that prompted the NCI's statement were presented to the
National Cancer Advisory Board on May 9 and a special clinical
alert was mailed Monday to 13,000 cancer specialists and cancer
organizations.
   ``Each year more than 60,000 women in this country are diagnosed
with node-negative breast cancer ... and we cannot delay informing
them and their physicians that additional treatment beyond surgery
and-or radiotherapy may be beneficial,'' DeVita said.
   Dr. Michael Friedman, an NCI researcher, said future U.S.
studies will focus on which forms of additional treatment are best,
rather than whether there is a benefit from any such treatment.
   It is estimated that 135,000 American women will get breast
cancer this year and that 42,000 will die from it. One in 10 women
will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.
   ``The emerging information from the three American studies is
consistent with a more mature body of information from European
investigators,'' the NCI announcement said.
   One U.S. study of 679 patients found 80 percent of those given
additional treatment were cancer-free after four years compared
with 71 percent who were not given additional treatment.
   The other study involved 2,644 patients in which 82 percent of
those given additional treatment were cancer-free after four years
compared with 77 percent of those receiving a placebo.
   The third involved about 350 patients and found 84 percent of
those given additional treatment cancer-free after three years
compared with 67 percent of those given a placebo.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs $14.3 Billion Foreign Aid Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has been given a $14.3 billion
foreign aid bill that represents a 2 percent increase over last
year's level and largely continues current programs.
   On a voice vote Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee
approved without amendment the bill passed earlier this month by
its foreign operations subcommittee. The bill covers the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.
   There was little debate on the measure because Congress has
little flexibility in dealing with appropriations as a result of
budget-cutting agreements reached late last year.
   Israel again would receive more than any other country under the
bill _ some $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in
economic assistance.
   Egypt, which is favored for making peace with Israel, receives
the second-largest amount _ $1.3 billion in military assistance and
$815 million in economic aid.
   Pakistan, which has been regarded as a front-line country
because of the Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan, would
receive $220 million in economic aid and $240 million in forgiven
loans for purchase of military goods.
   The Philippines would receive $124 million in economic aid and
$125 million in military aid.
   Some $90 million in economic support and $655 million in
economic development money would be used for African countries.
   In Central America, Honduras would get $85 million in economic
aid, Costa Rica $90 million, El Salvador $185 million and Guatemala
$80 million. Military aid for those and other countries was not
earmarked, but would come out of separate military aid and credit
accounts.
   The bill also would give economic aid of $40 million to
Portugal; $20 million to Morocco; $10 million to Tunisia; $15
million to Cyprus; between $10 million and $35 million for Ireland;
and $2 million for Poland's Solidarity trade union.
   Some $34 million would be set aside for Middle East development
projects, of which $11 million is for projects in Jordan and $23
million for those in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The bill would allocate $150 million to the Peace Corps, $101
million for international narcotics control, $362 million for
migration and refugee assistance, $35 million for the prevention of
AIDS worldwide and $254 million to pay past-due debts of
international financial institutions.
   It would send $217 million to support a long list of United
Nations organizations, and stipulate that the money for UNICEF must
be obligated within 30 days of passage of the bill, or the
administration would suffer an automatic cut of $50 million in
money for military aid.
   It is up to the State Department to decide how to divide up the
balance of funds for nations not specifically mentioned in the
bill. About 100 countries receive U.S. aid directly.

<HEAD>Pope's Trip Created Public Forum For Conflicts In Latin America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II created a public
forum for debate during his latest Latin American tour, shedding
light on political conflict, poverty and drug trafficking.
   Paraguay was the last and most sensitive stop on the pontiff's
12-day visit, with local Roman Catholic Church members criticizing
the 34-year authoritarian rule of President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   During his four-nation visit, the pope shared the stage with an
impoverished Bolivian miner, heard pleas by Peru's president to
help end terrorism and attended a gathering in Paraguay that turned
into a political protest rally.
   The tour that began in Uruguay May 7 and ended with his return
to Rome on Thursday was John Paul's ninth to Latin America since
becoming pope in 1978.
   When the pope and Stroessner met at the ornate 19th century
presidential palace, an announcer on the state-run television broke
in to alert viewers that the leader of their country was about to
speak.
   Paraguayans say an emotionless John Paul often looked down at
his hands during the encounter. They also heard the pontiff preach
to Stroessner on human rights and political freedoms.
   It was more remarkable the following day when the TV carried a
speech by actress Heddy Gonzalez Frutos denouncing political
repression during a meeting with the pontiff that the government
initially had canceled.
   ``The society in which we live is marked by a profound sense of
death and violence which are an affront to the rights and dignity
of the children of God,'' she told John Paul.
   An hour later, during a stop in Paraguay's Chaco region, it was
the turn of an Indian leader to denounce whites for stealing their
land.
   John Paul heard other messages as he journeyed high in the Andes
Mountains and nearly to the Amazon River.
   A miner in Oruro, Bolivia, describing the plight of workers hit
hard by the government's austerity program, told the pope in
emotional tones that they were out of work and hungry.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru, his democratically elected
government battling a deep economic crisis and a guerrilla
insurgency, denounced the interest rates his country is charged on
loans from foreign banks and appealed to the pope to do what he
could to halt the terrorist violence.
   For his part, John Paul offered some fresh if general
prescriptions for a region he called ``the continent of hope'' and
which the Vatican estimates will contain half the world's 900
million Catholics by the turn of the century. There now are about
860 million Catholics worldwide.
   Living a Christian life ``does not mean simply accepting with
resignation the difficulties that you encounter.''
   But he emphasized that Latin Americans must help themselves,
work hard and not expect outside aid will solve all their problems.
   He told an audience in Bolivia, a major cocaine-producer, that
they needed to wage an ``urgent'' battle against drug-trafficking
because corruption was destroying their society.
   John Paul heard Stroessner call his government democratic and
extol its law-and-order policies for keeping Paraguay free of
terrorism, hunger and drugs.
   But the following day the pope drew long applause for declaring
that the broad participation of the public was a requisite for
democracy.
   Stroessner, the longest-ruling head of state in the Western
Hemisphere, has been criticized for failing to allow a genuine
political opposition. The pope endorsed the efforts of his local
bishops to develop a ``pluralistic society.''

<HEAD>Private Report Suggests $2.5 Billion For Philippine Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. negotiators should agree to seek $2.5
billion over five years to keep military bases in the Philippines
on the condition that President Corazon Aquino move to allow the
bases beyond 1991, says a report today from a conservative think
tank.
   The report by Heritage Foundation policy analyst Richard D.
Fisher also advocates the sale of modern jet fighters and naval
warships to the Philippine military and a review of ``the entire
range of U.S. actions to keep Manila from expelling U.S. forces.''
   A review of the bases agreement which lapses in 1991 is under
way in Manila, with compensation for the bases a major issue.
   Neither side in the talks has indicated how much might be asked
for or paid. But suggestions by Philippine officials have ranged to
more than $1 billion a year over the current $180 million annual
aid attached to U.S. use of Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base
during the expiring five-year period.
   Actual military aid to the Philippines during the five years
will total about $1.7 billion, says Fisher in his report, ``A
Strategy for Keeping the U.S. Bases in the Philippines.''
   The Heritage Foundation is a privately funded think tank which
generally espouses conservative views, often paralleling those of
the Reagan administration.
   Aid tied to the bases is one of three major financial packages
being considered for the financially troubled Philippines which is
more than $28 billion in debt. The administration, according to
sources, is preparing to back a multinational effort to collect $10
billion over five years in aid, trade concessions and debt relief.
It has also asked Congress to appropriate $257 million in aid for
fiscal 1989, down $90 million from what Congress appropriated last
year.
   U.S. officials have suggested all the aid might be tied
together, but Mrs. Aquino has said she supports the multinational
aid idea only if it is not linked to what the Philippines views as
rent for the U.S. bases.
   Fisher, in his analysis, calls the U.S. military facilities in
the Philippines the ``American Gibraltar in Southeast Asia,''
saying that if the United States abandons them, the Soviet Union
will move in.
   ``Were the United States to withdraw from the bases, Moscow
surely would be emboldened to give direct assistance to the CPP,''
the Communist Party of the Philippines, he said. Philippine
officials estimate that up to 25,000 communist rebels are fighting
the government, and Fisher says the communists now control 20
percent of the countryside.
   Fisher criticizes Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
who lived in U.S. exile during eight years of martial law under
ex-President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The report describes Manglapus as
``a staunch nationalist apparently obsessed with the U.S. colonial
past.''
   Manglapus has said the bases do not protect the Philippines and
if the United States can't increase the rent, it should get out.
   The Heritage Foundation analyst also scores Mrs. Aquino for not
taking a stand on the bases.
   She has said only that she is keeping her options open until the
current agreement is renegotiated, sometime before 1991.
   ``Her vagueness tends to strengthen the hand'' of Manglapus, the
report says.
   A pro-bases view is being expressed by Philippine Defense
Minister Fidel V. Ramos, who was in New York today after five days
of meetings in Washington.
   Ramos, according to Filipino sources close to the former chief
military commander, assured U.S. officials that he believes the
bases aid both Philippine and regional security.
   Fisher said Aquino's view will be crucial if the Philippine
Senate decides to hold a referendum on the future of the bases.
   Fisher notes that while the Philippine constitution proclaims
``a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons in its territory,'' it
also contains a loophole which might allow them because it says the
policy must be ``consistent with the national interest.''
   Philippine officials traveling with Ramos say a bill to
eliminate the loophole has strong support in the nation's Senate,
but has less chance in what they describe as the more pro-American
House of Representatives.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hardly Mentions Jackson As Both Campaign In California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, making only passing
references to the upcoming Democratic presidential primary in
California, was placing his emphasis squarely on the fall campaign
against Republican George Bush.
   The Democratic front-runner, who expects to lock up his party's
presidential nomination with another windfall of delegates in the
closing primaries on June 7, scheduled appearances today in Los
Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco.
   He flew into the state Thursday and told a rally in Los Angeles
that in the fall election voters would have a choice ``between two
fundamentally different sets of values. Between two different sets
of beliefs about how we build a strong economy; about how we build
the best America.''
   Despite heckling by protesters claiming he was not doing or
saying enough about AIDS, Dukakis drew repeated cheers from the
crowd as he delivered a speech that belied his reputation as a dull
speaker.
   Hecklers in the auditorium of the Musicians' Hall on the west
side of Los Angeles held up signs saying, ``Bush + Dukakis More
AIDS Deaths.''
   ``We need a president who's not afraid to talk about AIDS,''
hecklers shouted.
   When Dukakis came to a section of his speech in which he
referred to changing research priorities from the military to
health care, he referred to acquired immune deficiency syndrome as
``a disease that must be conquered'' and said Massachusetts was
spending ``more per case for AIDS than any other state in America.''
   Homosexuals in Massachusetts accused the governor of
discriminating against them when he supported giving heterosexual
couples preference in adopting foster children.
   The only references Dukakis made to his Democratic primary rival
Jesse Jackson were tributes to the fact the Democratic race had
come down to choice between the son of Greek immigrants and a black
man born in poverty in the South.
   He hardly mentioned the June 7 primary, instead referring
several times to the importance of California in the fall election.
   ``The election this fall will be the most important and closest
since 1960,'' he said. ``And it may well be decided right here in
California.''
   He sounded his familiar themes of the need to attract more
people to teaching, of the need for a broader health care system,
for child care, and for a war on drugs.
   One of the loudest cheers came when he said, ``On January 20,
1989, we're going to have an attorney general _ no matter who she
or he is _ that will put the word ``justice'' back in the
Department of Justice.''

<HEAD>President Recalls Conversation Along Lines Speakes Cited in Quote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quotation that former press secretary Larry
Speakes fabricated closely resembles something President Reagan
recalls telling Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Reagan says.
   Speakes' confession of fabricated quotes drew harsh
condemnations from the White House when his book, ``Speaking Out,''
was released early last month.
   But Reagan told foreign broadcasters Thursday that ``actually, I
have to say he was not too far wrong with some of the things that
were said at our (his and Gorbachev's) earlier summit meetings.''
   In his book, Speakes said that during Reagan's first summit with
Gorbachev in Geneva in November 1985, he manufactured a quote in
the president's name. Speakes quoted Reagan as telling Gorbachev
privately that ``there is much that divides us, but I believe the
world breathes easier because we are talking here together.''
   On Thursday, Reagan, when asked to assess the impact of the
Speakes' revelations on the president's dealings with Gorbachev,
recalled the Geneva meeting that led to one of the fabricated
quotes:
   ``I remember that the general secretary and I, together in a
room one-on-one, remarked about the uniqueness of our situation,
and that very possibly, between us, war and peace for the world
could be decided depending on what we did. And I remember also
saying to him that I didn't think that we distrusted each other
because of our armaments, that we armed because we distrusted each
other.''
   Reagan had told the American Society of Newspaper Editors
convention in mid-April that he had not been aware of the
statements Speakes concocted.
   During his April 13 appearance before the newspaper editors
here, Reagan said ``I can tell you right now that I have no
affection for these kiss-and-tell books that are being written and
I find it entirely fiction.''
   After referring to a previous address he had delivered, Reagan
said: ``That's one of the nice things about his job. You get to
quote yourself shamelessly, and if you don't, Larry Speakes will.''

   Presidential candidate Carlos Salinas
de Gortari said Mexico will not pay its foreign debt if the burden
of its loan obligations keeps the country's economy from growing.
   Salinas de Gortari also pledged to open Mexico to foreign
investment, loosen state restrictions on the economy and guide the
nation into the battle for international markets.
   The nominee of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party
and the man virtually certain to succeed President Miguel de la
Madrid chose this conservative industrial city to outline his
economic policy.
   The PRI, as the governing party is known by its Spanish
initials, has not lost a presidential or gubernatorial election
since it was founded in 1929.
   In a speech Thursday night, Salinas de Gortari told businessmen
in this northeastern city near his family home that Mexico's
limping economy will grow again.
   He promised a policy of cooperation with foreign creditors
instead of ``irresponsible formulas of confrontation.''
   Mexico's foreign debt is about $100 billion, the second highest
in the developing world after Brazil. Mexico has been meeting
payments on its foreign loans and has built up a record amount of
foreign reserves.
   It has negotiated with its creditors for easier terms on the
foreign debt and is seeking more ways to ease the payment burden.
   But economic growth will have priority over payments on the
foreign debt, Salinas de Gortari said. ``If we fail to grow because
of the burden of the debt, we will not pay,'' he added.
   The candidate was cheered as he spoke of curtailing government
controls, reducing budget deficits and letting private business
invest in such areas as telecommunications, petrochemicals and
other fields that have been reserved for state investments.
   Previous administations have favored a more centralized economy
and tight economic controls.
   ``We will consolidate the opening of our markets and we will
promote foreign investment,'' Salinas de Gortari told the gathering.
   ``The opening of our economy to the foreign competition is an
irreversible fact,'' he said. ``Foreign investments must play a
more positive role contributing to the creation of jobs, to
technological modernization and the opening of foreign markets.''
   He stressed the need to eliminate subsidies and exercise
``financial discipline'' to make economic growth possible.
   Salinas de Gortari said the time was past in Mexico when the
state was ``the only instrument for the solution of each and every
problem of the economy and society.
   ``In this new strategy to develop exports, you will have to take
chances,'' he told the businessmen.
   Mexico's economy has been seriously affected in the past six
years by rocketing inflation that reached a record 159.2 percent in
1987.
   The government this year has managed to reduce the inflation
rate by persuading labor unions and private businesses to sign a
``solidarity pact'' that has put a lid on prices and wages in
recent months.
   ``We have no option,'' Salinas de Gortari said. ``Either we
succeed in making the economy work or the adverse social impacts
will magnify.''
   Presidential elections are scheduled for July 6, with the winner
sworn in on Dec. 1 for a six-year term in office.

   If the 100 dogs at Nabisco Brands' testing
center are any indication, the cracker company may have a winner on
its hands with its new doggie breath fresheners meant to improve
Fido's social skills.
   The dogs, ``on full-time staff'' at the Sherburne, N.Y., testing
center, have sampled the new version of Milkbone dog biscuits and
are begging for more, Nabisco spokesman Mark Gutsche said Thursday.
   ``They've given it their five-paw rating,'' he said.
   The new product combines dog biscuits with breath mints. The
biscuits, which will debut nationwide by the end of the month, are
designed to clean teeth like regular Milkbones but also improve a
dog's breath.
   ``There is a problem with halitosis among dogs,'' Gutsche said.
``This delivers the regular benefits plus the added benefits of
mint.''
   Others were skeptical.
   ``Milkbone is a good product, but I don't think anything will
work on a dog's breath except activated charcoal,'' which absorbs
odors, said 45-year veteran veterinarian Harold S. Smith of Milford.
   A dog's diet, which consists primarily of meat, lends itself to
bad breath, said Smith, a past president of the New Jersey State
Veterinarians Association.
   ``They don't exactly have the best breath in the world,'' he
said. ``There's no such thing as baby's breath for a dog.''

   The tattered object was pink _
an unusual color for Alan McFarland to spot in his Iowa farm field
_ so he stopped to look.
   What he found was a broken balloon with an invitation attached
to visit Surrey. McFarland's first question was, ``Where the Sam
Hill is Surrey?''
   It's 1,340 miles northwest of Whiting, Iowa _ as the balloon
flies.
   McFarland said he was planting soybeans Monday when he found the
invitation to ``visit Surrey, B.C., Canada.''
   ``If it hadn't been pink I don't think I would have even
stopped, but that's an unusual color to come across out there in
the dirt,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday with the
Vancouver Sun. Surrey is a Vancouver suburb.
   McFarland, 52, called the Surrey Chamber of Commerce and learned
his discovery was one of 2,000 helium balloons released Saturday to
kick off Tourism Week. Each carried a chance to win a trip to
Surrey.
   The trip will be awarded to the person farthest from Surrey who
finds a balloon and contacts the chamber of commerce before May 31.
   Dianne Rempel of the chamber of commerce said Wednesday that two
balloons recovered in Montana were the only others found outside
British Columbia to date.
   Meanwhile, a man in Shawnee, Okla., said Thursday he hasn't had
the same luck tracking down the origins of a balloon he found a few
weeks ago.
   Bob James doesn't have any idea just how far the balloon
traveled before he snared it behind the factory where he works.
Inside, it contained a message from ``Whitmore Elementary,'' but
didn't include the name of the town.
   The Oklahoma Education Department checked its records but could
find no Whitmore Elementary in the state.
   James said he and a co-worker spotted the white balloon May 4 as
it drifted to the ground. They noticed something inside and joked
about splitting the contents.
   But it contained no promise of a free trip _ only a note about
eating plenty of fruit and getting eight hours of sleep a night.

   Faddish ``one-shot'' strategies for quitting
smoking, such as sensory deprivation and injections, usually won't
hack it alone, says a survey that concludes the best course is
getting a doctor's advice and support from others.
   The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed 39 studies of
stop-smoking techniques. They ranged from the ``one-shot''
strategies to combinations of techniques like physician counseling,
nicotine gum and behavioral therapy.
   ``Success was not associated with novel or unusual
interventions,'' the research team reports in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Rather than quick fixes, the best way to stop smoking is through
direct counseling from physicians and other experts, as well as the
use of stop-smoking groups, booklets and self-help tapes, says a
co-author of the report, Dr. Thomas E. Kottke of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
   ``I would ... tell the patient to avoid some of the very
high-cost programs that offer some kind of magical approach,'' he
said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``They aren't worth the
money, and rarely work.''
   Kottke said he advises physicians to find out what kind of
program a smoker would feel most comfortable with, and make a
selection on that basis.
   ``Acupuncture or hypnotism, by themselves, don't seem to work
for long,'' he said, ``but there are cases where the patient has
good rapport with the hypnotherapist or acupuncturist and gets lots
of prolonged contact with them; then they can work.''
   Kottke cautioned in the report: ``There is no single
intervention method clearly more effective for all people than the
other methods.''
   Instead, success in quitting was found to be ``the product of
personalized smoking-cessation advice and assistance, repeated in
different forms by several sources over the longest feasible
period,'' said the survey by the government-coordinated research
group.
   Nicotine gum was helpful, but it is available only through
prescription and not everyone can use it, Kottke said in the
interview.
   He found the rate of smokers taking up the habit again is
``amazingly high.''
   ``About a quarter of (the) people who try to quit relapse within
two days, and half do in a week,'' he said.
   Kottke said researchers found the ``recidivism rate'' was
closely related to the length of time the smoker underwent
counseling. ``Without repeated and prolonged contact _ in person,
by telephone or by letter _ the best techniques can fail.''
   A related report in the journal said a blood-pressure drug
called clonidine has been shown effective in reducing the craving
to smoke and helping people quit.
   That study focused on 71 heavy smokers who had tried
unsuccessfully to quit. Thirty-three took clonidine and 38 took a
placebo, with neither group knowing which it was taking. All
subjects underwent behavioral therapy.
   Six months after discontinuing medication, 27 percent of the
clonidine subjects reported they were still not smoking, compared
with 5 percent of those who took the placebo, the researchers said.
   Clonidine, also marketed as Catapres, inhibits some of the
action of the nervous system.
   Its success in helping people quit smoking is similar to that
reported with nicotine gum, but clonidine may eventually prove
superior because it doesn't perpetuate nicotine dependence, the
study suggested.

<HEAD>Prospective Jurors Screened As Mecham Criminal Trial Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Evan Mecham planned to spend
the weekend weeding out obviously biased candidates for the jury in
the former governor's criminal trial on charges he concealed a
campaign loan.
   The trial began Thursday, when 100 prospective jurors were sworn
in and filled out long questionnaires aimed in part at eliminating
people who may have been influenced by the publicity surrounding
the case.
   ``There goes my weekend,'' said Mecham's defense lawyer, Michael
Scott, noting that attorneys on both sides hope to analyze the
forms before meeting again Monday.
   Mecham, 64, and his brother, Willard, are charged with
concealing the $350,000 campaign loan by failing to report it on
the former governor's campaign or personal finance statements.
   Mecham, a Republican, is charged with six felony counts of
perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. Willard
Mecham, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar
counts.
   Mecham was removed from office last month when the state Senate
convicted him on impeachment charges. He could face up to 22 years
in prison if convicted of all six counts in the trial, while his
brother could be sentenced to up to 9{ years if convicted on the
three counts he faces.
   Neither attended Thursday's initial session in Maricopa County
Superior Court. Scott said Mecham probably will attend court next
week, after the questioning of potential jurors begins.
   The questionnaire was worked out by the prosecution, defense and
trial Judge Michael Ryan.
   Among the 99 questions were whether the panelists know anyone
involved in the case, whether they signed or circulated petitions
for or against Mecham while he was governor and whether they belong
to the John Birch Society.
   Also, they were asked whether they knew anyone on a long list of
people associated with Mecham or his criminal case.
   The former governor has refused to predict whether he will fare
better in court than at his impeachment trial. The Senate removed
Mecham on April 4, 15 months into his first term, by convicting him
of trying to thwart a death threat investigation and of misusing
$80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning the money to
his auto dealership.
   Mecham was also impeached on charges of concealing the $350,000
loan, but the Senate decided not to consider that charge for fear
of prejudicing Mecham's criminal trial.
   Prosecutors said the Mechams failed to report the loan from
Tempe developer Barry Wolfson until after a newspaper reported it
in October 1987.
   On Wednesday, a state Supreme Court justice refused a defense
request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense
motion to return the charges to the grand jury. The Arizona Supreme
Court is to hear arguments on that issue June 1.
   The defense filed two new motions, released Thursday. One asks
the judge to dismiss the charges based on a claim that the campaign
and personal finance reporting laws are unconstitutionally ``vague,
ambiguous, imprecise and overbroad.''
   The other asks that the charges be remanded to the grand jury
for a new finding of whether probable cause exists. That motion
argued that grand jury materials were improperly turned over to the
prosecutors in Mecham's impeachment trial.
   Ryan did not schedule arguments on the motions.

   Sikh radicals were blamed for the
killings of 14 more people in Punjab state. At the Golden Temple,
crews worked today to clear Sikhism's holiest shrine of debris from
a 10-day siege by security forces.
   Five of the victims killed Thursday night in Punjab state were
Hindu migrant workers from the eastern state of Bihar.
   Police said the workers were lined up against a wall and shot by
eight Sikh gunmen, the United News of India reported. The killings
occurred in Chinna Karam Singh village, 18 miles northwest of
Amritsar.
   It was the second attack on migrant workers this week,
suggesting that the extremists are trying to undercut agriculture,
the mainstay of this northern state's economy.
   On Tuesday night, Sikh gunmen killed more than 30 Hindu workers
as they slept at a camp near the state capital of Chandigarh.
   Other deaths reported Thursday night which police blamed on
Sikhs included five people killed in a village in Jalandhar
District and four shot to death as they waited for a bus in
Bhatinda District.
   The deaths raised to more than 1,100 the number of people killed
by Sikh extremists in Punjab this year. In all of 1987, about 1,030
people were slain.
   Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
more political autonomy or an independent homeland in Punjab, where
they are a majority. Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of India's
800 million people and claim they are discriminated against by the
nation's majority Hindus.
   State-run All India Radio today quoted an unidentified
government official in Amritsar as saying cleaning was nearly
complete at the Golden Temple and ``steps are being taken to
restore traditional rituals.''
   The government siege of the temple ended Wednesday with the
surrender of the last Sikh extremists.
   Police cordoned off the complex May 9 after radicals inside
fired on police officers conducting an inspection outside its
walls, wounding five of them.
   Rituals at the golden-domed temple include a continuous reading
of the Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, and the singing of
hymns. Sikhism was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to
Hinduism and Islam.
   Visitors to the inner sanctum of the temple often take a
ceremonial dip in the surrounding pool, which is considered sacred.
   On Thursday, bomb disposal squads searched the temple to make
sure the surrendering extremists did not leave explosives behind.
There were no reports of any explosives being found.

<HEAD>Officials Say Dropping Noriega Charges Could Crush Morale in War
On Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morale among prosecutors and drug agents battling
narcotics trafficking could be undermined if drug charges are
dropped against Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
say those involved in the case.
   ``Why are we prosecuting all these people?'' asked U.S. Attorney
Leon Kellner. ``Why are we investigating all these people who do
drugs, when people who sit outside this country and allow their own
countries to be used for drug trafficking can make deals without
even our input?''
   Jack Hook, spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration in Miami said the handling of the Noriega case
``sends one signal to the law enforcement community and sends a
totally opposite signal to the drug traffickers in South America.''
   ``Are we just wasting our time?'' he asked.
   Kellner, whose office brought the indictment against Noriega,
was in Washington last week to try to block any deal for dropping
the charges. He criticized his exclusion from the Reagan
administration's negotiations with Noriega.
   ``I have not had a single phone call from anybody,'' he said
Wednesday. ``I'm upset. Apparently, I guess, I'm going to find out
what's going to happen to our cases at the same time as everybody
else does.''
   Not long before the reports of the negotiations with Noriega
surfaced, Kellner announced late last month he would be leaving the
U.S. attorney's post to rejoin his old law firm. He said he was
leaving for personal reasons.
   Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie said the
possibility of a political defeat in the Noriega case has crushed
his spirit and that of other prosecutors and agents in Miami who
worked on the case.
   ``We've spent a lot of time and effort making this case,'' he
said. ``The assistants who worked on the case in this office and
myself ... would certainly be most disappointed if the case is not
allowed to go forward.''
   Other prosecutors, however, had mixed reactions to the Noriega
negotiations.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Senatore, a prosecutor in the
public corruption section, said he differentiates between ``any
political decisions that go on in Washington'' and ``my job of
fighting crime here in this district.''
   Noriega was indicted in February in Miami and Tampa on drug and
racketeering charges. The Reagan administration is conducting
negotiations to drop the charges in exchange for Noriega's
agreement to step aside as leader of the troubled nation.

   Lawyers for detained Palestinians claimed the
Israeli military justice system has buckled under a flood of Arab
inmates, but army sources said prisons will be centralized and
computerized for efficiency.
   Many of the thousands of Palestinians imprisoned during the
5-month-old uprising in the occupied lands are held incommunicado
for weeks or miss court appearances because authorities can't
locate them, their lawyers said Thursday.
   ``It's a big mess,'' Israeli lawyer Lea Tsemel told The
Associated Press. ``The army is completely inefficient.''
   Also Thursday, left-wing Israeli legislator Dedi Zucker issued
new figures on detentions. He said 1,900 Arabs _ one in every 200
men over 18 _ are being held in jail for six months without trial.
   Another 8,100 Palestinians are in prison awaiting trial or
serving sentences for specific charges, Zucker said.
   Similar figures were released by Law in the Service of Man, a
human rights monitoring group founded by West Bank lawyers. The
organization said between 7,000 and 9,000 Palestinians are in
jails, in addition to about 2,000 administrative detainees held
without trial.
   Since the uprising started Dec. 8, 17,000 Palestinians _ 4
percent of the male population over 14 _ have been detained, said
Jonathan Kuttab, a lawyer and member of the human rights group.
   Army officials refused comment, saying they had to check their
detention figures.
   Israel radio today quoted the army legal adviser in the West
Bank, Lt. Col. Dudu Yahav, a saying 1,800 Palestinians were being
held without trial in administrative detention.
   Most are leaders of the outlawed youth group Shabibe, which is
linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization's mainstream Fatah
faction, Yahav was quoted as saying.
   He said most detainees were being held without trial because
there was insufficient evidence to bring them to court.
   A military prosecutor said last week that 5,000 Palestinians
were being held, including 1,700 in administrative detention.
   According to U.N. figures, 191 Palestinians have been killed
since anti-occupation protests began in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Two Israelis also have died. Israel seized the lands
from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The army has built five detention centers in Israel and the
occupied lands to accommodate those detained during the unrest and
has housed some detainees in 17 other prisons.
   A military source said Thursday that the army is adopting
several measures to make the West Bank prison system more efficient.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the army
plans to appoint a high-ranking officer to oversee all prisons in
the West Bank, install a computer in each facility to keep track of
prisoners, and close smaller detention centers.
   And a senior officer in the West Bank's central command,
identified only as Lt. Col. Shuki, was quoted as saying that
detainees with the same legal status will be housed in the same
prison.
   All administrative detainees will be moved to a prison camp in
Israel's southern Negev Desert, the domestic Itim news agency
quoted Shuki as saying.
   Lawyers for Palestinian prisoners were skeptical about the plans.
   ``We have filed many complaints, and now they say they are going
to organize everything,'' said Ms. Tsemel. ``We've been hearing
this for two months.''
   Ms. Tsemel said she and several colleagues sent a letter to the
army on Wednesday saying the lawyers strike if the situation does
not improve.
   Lawyer Felicia Langer, who has represented more than 100
Palestinians, said she often searched for clients two or three
weeks before prison authorities located them.
   ``Even those who are charged are sometimes not brought to court
on the date of their trial,'' Ms. Langer added.
   ``The only thing that will improve the situation is to release
people and not to treat them as animals, dehumanize them,'' she
added.
   Israeli officials have denied allegations of mistreatment and
inefficiency.
   Shuki was quoted by Israel radio today as saying that three
soldiers were investigated recently on charges they mistreated
prisoners, and three detainees were released after a probe showed
they were being held without justification.
   In another development Thursday, the West Bank's military
government permitted reunification of 40 Palestinian families as a
goodwill gesture.
   The government applies stringent standards in issuing residency
permits, often granting only temporary tourist visas to
foreign-born spouses of West Bank residents. As a result, hundreds
of Palestinian families are separated.

<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old boy described as a diligent
student was arrested for selling cocaine on a city street corner,
and his mother said she did everything she could to stop him,
including moving to a new home.
   Police said they arrested the boy and Dale Smith, 20, after
watching them conduct several drug sales Wednesday night.
   Sgt. Fred Bealfeld said Smith had used the second-grader to
conduct several drug sales before they were arrested. Police
confiscated 14 bags of cocaine worth about $280 from the child
after a brief chase that ended at his back porch.
   ``Using kids this young is becoming the trend rather than the
exception,`` Bealfeld said.
   The boy's 28-year-old mother said Thursday she had found bags of
cocaine on him in the past and returned them to the dealers.
   ``I told him, `They are going to catch you holding drugs,''' she
said. She even took him on a tour of the Maryland Penitentiary last
month but ``it didn't do any good,'' she said.
   The boy said he spent the money he received, about $4 or $5.
   ``The carnival's been here two weeks, and he played the carnival
all two weeks,'' said the mother.
   The boy was described by his school principal as a diligent
student in his second-grade special education class.
   ``He turns his homework in on time, completes all his
assignments. ... He is really a good student,'' said Bentalou
Elementary School principal Mary A. Winterling.
   ``I think he knew that drugs were somehow bad, but at his age
it's a lot different to say drugs are bad, don't mess with them,
than it is to say the stove is hot, don't touch it,'' Bealfeld said.
   The boy's mother said she moved from a public housing project to
a rowhouse with her twin sister to get away from an environment of
drug dealing but her current neighborhood is just as bad.
   The boy's father was killed in a drug-related shooting in the
housing projects, and the boy witnessed a drug-related slaying of a
23-year-old man three years ago, she said.
   Smith was charged with possession of cocaine with the intent to
distribute, possession of cocaine, conspiracy to distribute cocaine
and using a minor to distribute cocaine.
   The boy was charged as a juvenile with possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute. He was later taken home.

   A new study says the Hispanic vote could be
the deciding factor affecting the results in a close presidential
race in several states.
   The report said Hispanic voters can influence the selection of
71 percent of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
   California, which has 47 electoral votes, and New York, with 36,
were cited as two among nine key states where the strength of the
Hispanic vote could alter statewide results.
   ``The Hispanic vote has the potential of being a true swing vote
in 1988,'' said Harry Pachon, national director of the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which
sponsored the study that was released Thursday.
   The other states mentioned by the group include Texas with 29
electoral votes, Illinois with 24, Florida 21, New Jersey 16,
Colorado 8, Arizona 7 and New Mexico 5.

<HEAD>Rejected Georgia GOP Delegates Can Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In response to a court order, the Georgia
Republican Party has agreed that 968 would-be delegates to the
party's state convention in Albany can appeal their
disqualifications.
   GOP spokesman Lee Raudonis announced Thursday evening that the
delegates could appear today before the party's interim credentials
committee in Albany. They also have a right to appeal to the full
convention, he said.
   The two-day convention was scheduled to start today at the
Albany Civic Center.
   Superior Court Judge William Towson ruled Thursday afternoon
that the 968 disqualified delegates can go to the convention and
appeal their status.
   In his temporary restraining order, the Laurens County judge
enjoined the party from deciding the fate of the contested
delegates without first notifying them of their right to appeal.
   He also enjoined the party from denying them admission to the
convention or restricting their rights.
   Raudonis said the 11-member credentials committee would begin
meeting today and the challenges probably would be heard on a
county-by-county basis.
   After all appeals are heard, the committee will issue a report
to the full convention, which will then hear any appeals and vote
on the list of approved delegates.

   One prominent name will be missing from
the roster of Michigan delegates to the 1988 Democratic National
Convention.
   Richard Austin, secretary of state for the past 17 years and
consistently the highest vote-getter among candidates for statewide
office, has decided to stay in Michigan instead of joining fellow
Democrats in Atlanta.
   He will become Michigan's acting governor while Gov. James
Blanchard is in Atlanta.
   ``I'm going to be minding the store,'' Austin said Thursday.
``The governor has informed me that he has some things that he
feels might develop.''
   If Austin hadn't agreed to stay behind there would have been a
dramatic, though brief, philosophical change in the control of
state government.
   All four of the top elected officials in the state are
Democrats. Blanchard, Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths, Austin, who is
third in line of succession and Attorney General Frank Kelley.
   Kelley, Blanchard and Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths are going to be
convention delegates.
   If Austin joined the other top elected Democrats in crossing the
state line at the same time, Michigan would get a Republican as
substitute governor: Senate Pro Tempore Nick Smith of Addison who
has been fifth in line of succession for 17 months and has yet to
get a shot at the top.

   The law school deans at American University
and Georgetown University announced their resignations the same
day, adding to the list of law school deans around the country who
have quit in recent years.
   Frederick R. Anderson, 46, dean at AU's law school, said
Thursday he will become a professor at the law school June 1. He
will hold the law school's first endowed professorship, for which
he raised $1.5 million two years ago. Anderson was dean for three
years.
   Robert Pitofsky, 58, said he plans to resume teaching at
Georgetown after a one-year sabbatical. He was dean for six years.
   Both cited a desire to devote more time to teaching and
scholarship.
   George Washington University Law School, also in the District of
Columbia, named a new dean last month, and new deans have assumed
positions at the law schools of Catholic and Howard universities in
the past two years. The George Mason University law school in
suburban Arlington, Va., also named a new dean in the last two
years.
   According to the American Bar Association, 86 of the nation's
174 ABA-approved law schools have hired new deans in the last three
years, and the average stay of deans has slipped from six years to
3.2 years.
   Top law school faculty, Pitofsky said, are paid almost as much
as deans. In addition, faculty members have the time and
opportunity for outside earnings, said Pitofsky and others.

   President Gustav Husak has

   The agreement with the Soviet Union and East Germany allows the
United States to make about 400 inspections in the three Warsaw

   The Soviet Union began withdrawing some medium-range and
shorter-range nuclear missiles from Czechoslovakia and East Germany
in March.
   The withdrawals took place under the terms of the superpowers'
treaty calling for elimination of those missiles.
   The removals were made even though the pact, signed Dec. 8 in
Washington, still must be ratified by the U.S. Senate.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz has been urging that
the treaty be ratified before President Reagan travels to Moscow

<HEAD>Rebels Balk At Returning To Managua, Deny New Peace Talks
Scheduled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rebel leaders are refusing to hold the
next round of peace talks in Managua unless the leftist government
lifts restrictions on the media and allows the Contras to move
freely in the capital city.
   The Contras, as the rebels are known, also disagreed on Thursday
with a Sandinista government statement that a third round of peace
talks has been scheduled. The government reported Wednesday that
negotiators would meet May 25-28.
   Contra leaders said they would prefer the talks resume today in
the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Guatemala or Mexico.
   The government statement said the site of the talks was
undecided, but that the Sandinistas proposed that they take place
in Managua, where two rounds of negotiations have been held.
   The U.S.-backed Contras complained that during the previous
sessions the government forced them to remain in a hotel near the
international airport and prevented them from meeting with internal
opposition leaders.
   In their statement Thursday, the Contras said they would return
to Managua only if the government agreed to ``suspend all
censorship of communications media and end the threats and
mistreatment by Sandinista officials against independent
broadcasters.''
   The statement, read to The Associated Press by telephone from
Miami, said the Contras should be allowed to meet local opposition
leaders and make their case on radio and television.
   The government said Wednesday it would allow the rebels to meet
with the main opposition group, the Nicaraguan Democratic
Coordinate, at the hotel where they stayed before. The rebels want
to stay at a more centrally located site.
   Negotiations are aimed at reaching a permanent truce in the
civil war, which began in November 1981. The two sides signed an
agreement on March 23 for a 60-day cease-fire that expires May 30.
   Negotiators have been unable to work out details for a permanent
truce, although they have agreed on seven zones where the rebels
are to gather during a cease-fire.
   The two sides remain far apart on such issues as democratic
reforms and what role Contra leaders will play in Nicaragua's
political future.
   In another development, the Reagan administration on Thursday
announced approval of a $10 million grant to monitor compliance
with the Nicaraguan peace process.
   In San Jose, Costa Rica, Contra rebel leader Alfredo Cesar said
a recent split in Contra ranks over the military leadership of Col.
Enrique Bermudez has been resolved.
   Cesar, a director of the Contra umbrella group, the Miami-based
Nicaraguan Resistance, said: ``The internal military conflict
provoked by several commanders now has been overcome and Col.
Bermudez was confirmed in his job as supreme military chief of our
forces.''
   There were reports late last week that up to 4,000 Contra
guerrillas gathered around a base camp in Yamales, 20 miles north
of the Honduran border, to protest Bermudez' command.
   Sources had said some rebels charged Bermudez with corruption
and inefficiency.
   Cesar said there were only about 200 dissidents at the base camp.
   ``I can guarantee 100 percent that our troops are now unified
again and support the directorship of the Nicaraguan Resistance in
the negotations that we have with the Sandinista government,'' said
Cesar.

<HEAD>Free Trade Agreement Renews Debate Over Exporting Water To The
U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposals are Gargantuan: a 400-mile Grand
Canal from the icy rivers of northern Canada to the Great Lakes, or
an irrigation trench through the Rocky Mountains to the parched
American West.
   Could the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, now in the process
of ratification, make such massive diversions of fresh water a
reality?
   The subject was debated Thursday when two Canadian experts
disclosed that the trade agreement treats water like newsprint,
computers and other ``goods'' now subject to tariffs.
   The treaty will eliminate those tariffs and offer the United
States ``national treatment'' when it comes to Canadian water, said
former trade negotiator Mel Clark and Don Gamble of the Rawson
Academy of Aquatic Science in Ottawa.
   The discovery, they said, contradicts claims by the Conservative
government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that water was not part
of the trade deal.
   When questioned in Parliament, Trade Minister John Crosbie
indirectly confirmed that water exports are possible under the
treaty.
   But Crosbie told opponents that Canada cannot be forced to sell
water or any other natural resource.
   ``We are not obliged to sell one thimbleful of (water) to the
United States,'' he said, citing a federal announcement last
November that large-scale water diversions will not be contemplated.
   Frank Quinn of the government's Inland Waters Directorate told
The Associated Press that Canada wanted water exempted from the
trade deal but abandoned the demand in final compromises with U.S.
negotiators.
   ``In the 11th hour, we didn't get all the changes we wanted,''
he said.
   Quinn said the world General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which both countries recognize, allows a member to ban exports of
natural resources on grounds of conservation and environmental
protection.
   On that basis, he said, Canada will not permit diversions of
fresh water.
   Quinn said Canada's pledge under the Free Trade Agreement to
share energy resources in times of crisis only covers items
currently exported, such as gas and oil.
   ``We're not now exporting water, only dribs and drabs,'' he said.
   Border towns in Alberta, Manitoba and New Brunswick export small
quantities to local water systems in Montana, North Dakota and
Maine, and there are proposals to export water by tanker from
British Columbia and Quebec.
   In any case, Quinn said, even the thirstiest U.S. states are no
longer considering long-distance diversions because of the cost.
Instead, they are focusing on a transition from agricultural to
municipal use of local water.
   Should the United States run dry, Canada does seem a handy
solution.
   With 7 percent of the world's land area, Canada has 9 percent of
its renewable fresh water supply and only 1 percent of its
population. Eight percent of the country is covered by lakes.
   The problem is that 60 percent of the water flows north toward
the Arctic and is inaccessible to most Canadians, who live huddled
near the U.S. border.
   Thus the grand schemes.
   Newfoundland engineer Tom Kierans has spent 30 years promoting
his dream of turning Arizona desert into lush farmland with water
diverted from the rivers of northern Quebec and Ontario, now
flowing north into James Bay.
   Pumping stations would propel the water into a Grand Canal
across the Canadian Shield to the Ottawa River and on to Lake
Huron. From the Great Lakes, it would be pumped to the prairies and
desert. The estimated cost of construction alone: $100 billion.
   The same pricetag was put on a 1964 idea proposed by Ralph M.
Parsons Ltd., California engineers, to divert the Yukon and
McKenzie rivers through the Rocky Mountain Trench of western Canada
into the United States.
   A comprehensive Canadian study in 1985 advised a ``cautious
approach'' to such projects but called it ``imprudent to reject all
exports out of hand.''
   The author of that report, Professor Peter Pearse of the
University of British Columbia, told the AP the Grand Canal was
``not in anybody's interest on ecological or economic grounds.''
   He said it would cost $2,000 per thousand cubic meters simply to
get the water to the U.S. Southwest.
   Environmentalists oppose transferring water from one basin to
another because of the ecological impact and disruption to Indians
and Inuit dependent on fishing and hunting.
   ``It's always been a fear that this is on somebody's agenda,''
said Julia Langer, Canadian director of the Friends of the Earth.
``We haven't paid enough attention to real water conservation to be
even considering these kinds of megaprojects.''

   The United States has agreed to accept
as a political refugee a member of Cuba's cycling team, according
to a local newspaper report.
   El Norte said Thursday that Roger Vazquez Vazquez, 25, was in
the newspaper's offices when U.S. authorities telephoned him on
Wednesday with word of his acceptance.
   Vazquez was then taken to the border town of Laredo, Texas,
according to the news account.
   The U.S. Consulate in Monterrey said the U.S. government cannot
grant asylum to people until they are physically present in the
United States.
   Consulate spokesman Bob Brown said, however: ``We can help them
get to the United States as a refugee if they qualify.''
   Vazquez abandoned his team after a cycling race in Mexico City
last week and was given refuge by Mexican cyclists in this
northeastern industrial town. They cyclists took Vazquez to the
U.S. Consulate where his case was being considered.
   However, Vazquez became impatient and tried to leave Mexico on
his own. He was apprehended Sunday as he tried to go through a
federal migration checkpoint at Nuevo Laredo, about 16 miles south
of Laredo.
   He was jailed in Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo Leon state
about 135 miles south of Laredo, but was later released.
   In a letter published Thursday in El Norte, Vazquez described
himself as one ``who abandoned his beloved country to seek the
liberty that we lost 29 years ago and that we're going to regain in
the future.''
   Vazquez told the newspaper he plans to join family members in
Miami.

<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge revealed
that a Nicaraguan journalist working as a Sandinista agent had
``carried out missions in the heart of the CIA,'' a government
newspaper reported.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the governing Sandinista National
Liberation Front, on Thursday quoted Borge as saying Maria Lourdes
Pallais Checa was ``a counterintelligence agent who worked in enemy
ranks.''
   Pallais, 34, a graduate of Columbia University in New York, is a
niece of the late Anastasio Somoza, the pro-American dictator who
was overthrown by the Sandinistas in July 1979.
   The newspaper said Borge made the remarks Sunday during a tour
of Nicaragua's remote Caribbean coast. The Interior Ministry's
press office said Thursday that it had no further information on
Pallais.
   But a source in the Sandinista front, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Pallais is under protection of state security and
may soon hold a news conference.
   In New York, Pallais' lawyer, Ron Kuby, said: ``My client has
instructed me to confirm the accuracy of Mr. Borge's statement.''
   Kuby said he had no information about whether Pallais worked for
the CIA or the Sandinistas while she was employed by American and
European news organizations during five years in the United States.
   Kuby declined further comment. The CIA in Washington said it
would issue no statement.
   (Pallais worked for The Associated Press in New York from August
1978 until November 1979, first on the editing desk of the Latin
American service and then in the New York City bureau.)
   Borge was quoted as saying: ``She carried out missions in the
heart of the CIA.''
   ``Some have been there for several years and continue there;
others we have been forced to take out of there for different
reasons, and one by one they will continue to be claimed back by
our people,'' Borge said.
   No one answered the telephone Thursday at Pallais' home in
Managua.
   Her brother, Marcel, a supporter of the Sandinistas, was killed
by Somoza loyalists in October 1979.
   (Pallais resigned from the AP in 1979, saying she wanted to
investigate her brother's death and help care for her ailing
mother.)
   The Sandinista victory in July 1979 ended 42 years of rule in
Nicaragua by the rightist Somoza family.

<HEAD>Senate Proposal Would Modify War Powers Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnam-era law that has been the focus of a
long-running fight between the White House and Congress may be
overhauled by a proposal introduced in the Senate.
   ``Our goal is to make the statute more workable,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a sponsor of the measure to
reform the War Powers Act.
   ``Frankly, if I were president, I would thumb my nose at this
legislation. The War Powers Act has never really worked,'' said
Byrd Thursday about the existing legislation.
   The law, enacted in 1973, requires a report from the president
when U.S. military personnel are sent to situations of ``imminent
hostilities.'' Under some circumstances, those troops must be
withdrawn after 60 days or 90 days, unless Congress specifically
votes to authorize them to remain.
   Then-President Nixon vetoed the legislation, arguing that it was
an unconstitutional restriction on his authority, a position taken
by all three subsequent presidents.
   The new proposal would let the troops remain for an unspecified
length of time unless Congress votes to remove them. It also
creates a group of 18 senior congressional leaders who would
regularly meet with the president to discuss national security
matters.
   Congress, most recently threatened to invoke the War Powers Act
when President Reagan instituted his Persian Gulf policy of
reflagging 11 Kuwaiti-owned tankers and protecting them with Navy
warships.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Limits On Children's TV Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee has approved legislation
that would require television stations to limit advertising during
children's programs.
   The measure, approved Thursday in 22-2 vote by the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, is a bipartisan
compromise.
   Stripped from the House subcommittee's version are earlier
proposals to prohibit so-called ``program-length commercials''
built around toy manufacturers' products which Senate legislation
would have barred.
   The bill passed by the House subcommittee would limit TV
stations to no more than 10 1@2 minutes of commercials per hour
during children's shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during
these programs on weekdays.
   The bill, which was scheduled for consideration by the full

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Approving Radioactive Waste Compact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With some reservation, President Reagan has
signed federal legislation approving the Appalachian States
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact.
   In a statement announcing his signature, Reagan Thursday hailed
the more than three quarters of the states that have now entered
compacts on low-level radioactive waste, but he warned the
Appalachian commission against attempting to enforce federal laws. .
   He said the compacts ``underscore this nation's commitment to
take those actions needed to ensure the future availability of
nuclear power as an energy supply option for this country.''
   Reagan objected, however, to a provision of the bill giving the
commission federal law enforcement responsibility without requiring
that commissioners be appointed according to the appointments
clause of the Constitution.
   ``Any effort by the commission to enforce federal regulations
would contravene the Constitution,'' the president said.
   Under the compact _ which includes Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Delaware and Maryland _ the four states are required to ensure that
there is a regional facility sufficient to dispose of the region's
low-level waste, and that each state has equal access to it.

   A truck driver has made state lottery history
by winning two jackpots, with his latest prize totaling more than
$6 million, lottery officials announced.
   Robert E. Humphries of Philadelphia, who said he spends $45 a
week on the game, bought the computer-picked Wild Card Lotto ticket
May 6.
   The total annuity value of the jackpot is $6,364,818.18, the
12th largest individual prize won in lottery history, lottery
officials said Thursday.
   Humphries won his first lottery jackpot on March 7, 1986, and
shared the prize with four other winners. His share totaled
$421,433.25. He is the first person to win two jackpots since the
game began in 1972, said lottery Executive Director James Scroggins.
   Combined, Humphries' prizes have an annuity value of
$6,786,251.43. His net annual earnings from both wins are more than
a $250,000.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Humphries said after receiving his first of 21
payments of $242,469.27. ``I always had it in the back of my mind
that I was going to (win) again.''
   Humphries said he has been playing the Lotto and Super 7
lotteries since the early 1970s.
   He said he buys 15 tickets three nights a week, then carefully
records the winning numbers.
   ``I believe in giving yourself a winning edge,'' he said.
``You've got to try to cut down the odds.''
   His initial reaction to the news was caution, then elation, and
finally speculation about what he should do with the winnings,
Humphries said.
   Cars, homes and other such luxuries first came to mind, he said,
but he and his wife Marie decided instead to spend the money
helping out relatives.
   Humphries said he would take some time off from his job as a
truck driver for Marstan Industries.
   ``I won't be climbing on the truck real soon,'' he said.

   South Korea's Justice Ministry
announced today that 1,013 prisoners will be released Saturday
under special a parole to mark Buddha's birthday.
   No political detainees will be released under the amnesty and
ministry officials refused to comment.
   Opposition groups and dissidents are demanding the release of
all political prisoners. The government was reportedly considering
the release of some political prisoners to seek national
reconciliation.
   The political opposition and dissidents claim there are about
1,000 political detainees. Government officials say there are only
about 340, not counting people convicted of treason and sedition.
   The government freed 125 dissidents from prisons across the
country Feb. 27 in an amnesty marking the inauguration of President
Roh Tae-woo.
   About 15 million of South Korea's 42 million population are
Buddhists.

<HEAD>Self-Described Racist Indicted On Charge Of Threatening Jesse
Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-described racist indicted on a charge of
threatening to kill black presidential candidate Jesse Jackson says
he's innocent and authorities can't ``railroad'' him for his
beliefs.
   ``My views shouldn't persecute me, actions should,'' Londell
Williams said Thursday after a federal grand jury returned the
indictment. ``I haven't done anything. I haven't taken any actions
towards Mr. Jackson. My views haven't pointed a gun at anyone.
   ``They can't railroad me just because of what I believe,'' he
told the Belleville (Ill.) News-Democrat in an interview from the
federal detention facility at the St. Clair County Jail in
Belleville.
   Williams, 30, of Washington, Mo., was named in all four counts
of the indictment. His wife, Tammy, 27, was named in three of the
counts, but she was not accused of being involved in the threat on
Jackson's life.
   Federal agents initially said Williams claimed he belonged to
two violent white-supremacist groups: the Covenant, the Sword and
the Arm of the Lord, otherwise known as CSA, and The Order.
   But Tom Den Ouden, who heads the Springfield, Mo., FBI office,
said he had found no evidence Williams or his wife belonged to the
groups. And leaders of the groups said they never heard of Williams.
   ``It's possible that there are people who say they're in The
Order,'' said Order leader Bruce Carroll Pierce, 34, in a telephone
interview from the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan. ``But
they're not writing me letters telling me what they're planning.''
   Pierce is one of two men convicted in the slaying of Denver
radio personality Alan Berg in 1984.
   Ollie Ellison, one of two wives of imprisoned CSA leader James
Ellison, said Thursday she never heard of Williams. Ms. Ellison,
who is in hiding, answered questions for the Rocky Mountain News of
Denver through a third party.
   Both of the Williamses have denied any links to organized white
supremacist groups, and the Secret Service said Londell Williams
passed a lie detector test on the subject.
   The indictment differs from the initial arrest charges, which
accused the couple of being part of a conspiracy to kill Jackson.
   ``It does not appear to be a large overall plot as was first
reported,'' said Secret Service agent Rich Adams.
   The indictment said that on or about May 10, Williams
``knowingly and willfully did threaten to kill and inflict bodily
harm upon Jesse Jackson.''
   It charges both of the Williamses with possessing an AR-15
assault rifle that had been altered to make it fire like a machine
gun. The gun was to be used in a plot to kill Jackson, the
government said.
   The pair also were charged with two counts of threatening to
harm a government informant in retaliation.
   Prosecutors and the couple's attorneys met for several hours
after the indictments were issued but declined comment afterward.
Cynthia Short, Mrs. Williams' lawyer, would say only that ``They
(the Williamses) are scared.''
   Williams, a construction worker, faces a maximum penalty of
three years in prison and $250,000 in fines on the first count. On
each of the other three counts, the Williamses could be sentenced
to 10 years in prison and fined $250,000.
   U.S. District Judge Edward L. Filippine set arraignment for
Monday.
   The Williamses, who live in rural eastern Missouri with their
three daughters, have been held without bond since federal agents
arrested them Friday at their apartment. The arrests were announced
Tuesday.
   Franklin County, Mo., Sheriff Paul J. Bruns said an informer
told investigators that Williams not only possessed the rifle, but
that he was part of a plot to kill Jackson on June 21 or July 4.
   The sheriff said the informer led officers to a wooded area,
where they found the rifle.
   A Secret Service agent testified Tuesday that agents taped a
conversation in which Williams told the informer that the Covenant
wanted the rifle back and was planning Jackson's assassination.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was little change in the dollar today but
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed higher despite a
computer problem during the morning session.
   The dollar finished the day at 124.82 yen, 0.02 yen higher than
Thursday's close of 128.80 yen. After opening at 124.85 yen, the
dollar moved in a narrow range of 124.80 to 124.90 yen.
   ``Because a long weekend is nearing, traders don't seem to be
enthusiastic about setting up a new position,'' said Hiroaki
Shukuzawa of Sumitomo Bank. Markets in Europe will be closed Monday
in observance of Whitsunday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 20.61
points, or 0.08 percent from Thursday to close at 27,393.85.
   ``The strong dollar lifted share prices, but not as much as the
market expected,'' added Keiichi Nishida of Kidder Peabody's Tokyo
office.
   ``Overall trading was slow because of concern over the inflation
and the beginning of a long weekend,'' he said.
   Traders said the brief computer shutdown during the early
morning session kept the market from recovering further after two
consecutive days of decline.
   The computer system at the Tokyo Stock Exchange shut down
shortly after 9:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) during a bullish period in the
market, traders said.
   ``The computer problem may have had some effects on the market
in the sense that it could discourage investors from taking a
position,'' said a trader at a major securities firm. ``But it is
also true that there are other elements of concern such as
inflation and rising interest rates.''
   Yoshio Hirano of the TSE said they were forced to shut down the
entire computer system briefly to swith the main system to a
reserve system.
   The computer that controlled the trading of Mitsubishi Steel
Manufacturing Co. shares, one of the most popular shares in recent
trading, became inoperable, he said.
   Hirano denied speculation that excess orders for the shares
caused the computer to break down. Investigations were continuing
into the system failure, he said.
   The volume traded today was 800 million shares.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union wants to open a trade
office in South Korea after the Olympic Games in Seoul, local
business leaders said today.
   Some high-ranking Soviet officials expressed their interest when
South Korean businessmen visited Leningrad last week to take part
in an electronics show, officials of Goldstar Co. said.
   Goldstar and three other top South Korean electronics firms are
participating in the ``Leningrad Electronics Show,'' which opened
May 12 in that Soviet city for an 11-day run.
   It is the first time South Korean firms have been invited to a
trade show in the Soviet Union. Despite the absence of diplomatic
relations, the two countries have been expanding sports, cultural
and economic contacts in recent years.
   Koo Young-soo, chief of Goldstar's motor sales department,
quoted I.T. Kanaev, deputy chief of the Soviet Union's Chamber of
Commerce and Industries, as saying: ``We hope to open a trade
office in Seoul immediately after the Olympics.''
   The Games begin in September.
   Kanaev specifically asked Goldstar managing director Shin
Dong-ki to help with the Soviet plan and relay it to the South
Korean government, Koo said.
   Koo, who returned from Leningrad early this week, said Leningrad
Mayor P. Kyurshin also called for expanded trade contact with South
Korea when he visited a Goldstar showroom.
   The Goldstar and other South Korean showrooms attracted about
1,000 people daily and many Soviet officials said they wanted to
import electronic parts such as motors and color television tubes
from South Korea, Koo said.
   Trade between the Soviet Union and South Korea has so far been
conducted through third countries. Their two-way trade was
estimated at $140 million in 1986. Figures for 1987 were
unavailable.

<TEXT>
   Two men who died on the same day were
mistaken for each other, leading one to be cremated in the other's
place while horrified mourners viewed the wrong man in an open
coffin.
   Both men died May 9 and were taken to the morgue at Yale-New
Haven Hospital, authorities said. Both were transported from there
to Sisk Brothers funeral homes in New Haven and in Hamden.
   Patrick Sisk, one of the funeral home's owners, blamed the
hospital.
   ``The tags were wrong,'' he said. Sisk said his attorney was
preparing to file a complaint with the state against the hospital.
   Authorities said the body of Thomas P. Eagan, 68, of North Haven
was to have been buried May 13 but instead was cremated. William J.
Gormley, 73, of East Haven was to have been cremated, but his body
appeared dressed in Eagan's suit in an open coffin May 12 during
calling hours at the funeral home in Hamden, the New Haven Register
reported in today's editions.
   Thomas Urtz, a hospital spokesman, said four bodies were
released May 9 to Sisk Brothers, which was handling arrangements
for all four, and added, ``We take great precautions to make sure
that we appropriately identify bodies before they leave the
hospital.''
   The Eagans filed a complaint Thursday against the funeral home
with the state Department of Health Services. The family also hired
an investigator to find out who made the error.
   ``There had to be an extremely large number of mistakes made in
order for this to have happened,'' said Thomas P. Eagan Jr. of
North Branford, one of Eagan's three sons. ``There had to be major
negligence. I would never want another family to have to go through
this.''
   The Eagans must cope with the knowledge that Thomas Eagan was
cremated against his and his family's wishes, said the family's
attorney, Thomas W. Boyce Jr.
   Eagan died unexpectedly overnight and the wake was important to
the family, Boyce said.
   ``The grieving process is an important part of dealing with it,
and the wake is an important part of the whole structure,'' Boyce
said.
   Gormley's daughter-in-law, Karen Gormley, said the funeral home
did not tell the family what had happened, other than to ask that a
relative on May 13 affirm the identity of the deceased William
Gormley.
   Boyce said Thursday he did not know who was responsible for the
mistake. He said the family filed the complaint to make sure a
similar mistake doesn't happen again. It was filed against the
funeral home because ``they're the ones that ultimately made the
arrangements,'' Boyce said.
   A state medical examiner had signed a certificate that allowed
Eagan's cremation, the newspaper reported.
   Eagan's cremated remains were placed in a casket May 13 by
Keenan Funeral Home, which replaced Sisk Brothers at the request of
the family. A traditional funeral was held, along with a mass of
Christian burial and burial of the remains.
   Gormley's body since has been cremated. A memorial service for
him was held at Sisk Brothers.

   About 400 people led by Tibetan monks
marched today through the streets of Dharamsala to appeal to China
to spare four Tibetans arrested in the death of a Chinese policeman.
   The policeman died during protests in the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa in March.
   Dharamsala, in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, is
the home of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader,
and many of his followers.
   Tibetan shops and businesses were closed today as part of the
protest.
   Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported in April that four men
were arrested April 14 in connection with the March 5 death of the
policeman. As many as 24 people died in clashes that day in Lhasa.
   The Dalai Lama on Thursday issued a statement saying there were
reports that the four Tibetans would be executed and urging that
they be spared.
   The men were identified as Lobsang Tenzin, a student of Tibet
University at Lhasa; Tsering Dhondup, a monk; Gyaltsen Chophel, a
businessman; and Sonam Wangdu, a carpenter.
   Today's demonstration was organized by the Dharamsala Tibetan
Freedom Movement, a lobby group. It said appeals were sent to the
prime ministers of India and China.
   China invaded Tibet in 1959. The Dalai Lama and about 100,000 of
his followers fled to India that year after an abortive Tibetan
uprising.

<TEXT>
   Actor Stuart Whitman says only half the
cremated remains of his friend Peter Lawford were in an urn removed
from a crypt this week for scattering at sea by Lawford's last wife.
   ``We had this big party at my house _ a big one with champagne
and toasts _ right after he died and he had been cremated,''
Whitman said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   ``Then we dumped half the ashes in the ocean,'' Whitman said.
``He was a dear friend. He would have enjoyed it.''
   Whitman, a Malibu resident, said the group of about 10 people
included Lawford's last wife, Patricia Seaton Lawford.
   Mrs. Lawford, reached by telephone, said she could not recall a
scattering of ashes at the Dec. 26, 1984, party. She said she did
attend the party, however.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Lawford scattered the remainder of Lawford's
remains in the Pacific Ocean following a dispute over payment of
funeral expenses.
   Lawford's ashes were taken from a crypt at Westwood Village
Cemetery and turned over to Mrs. Lawford, who said Lawford's
children by his previous wife, Patricia Kennedy Lawford, had
refused to pay the burial bills. Patricia Kennedy Lawford is a
sister of the late President John F. Kennedy.
   Patricia Seaton Lawford, 30, was the fourth wife of ``The Thin
Man'' television star, and was at his side when he died of heart
failure at age 61.
   The $10,000 funeral bill was supposed to be paid by the four
children Lawford had with Patricia Kennedy Lawford, Mrs. Lawford
said. ``The Kennedys wouldn't pay,'' she said.
   However, a statement from Lawford's children in New York
contradicted the unpaid funeral expenses allegation.
   ``The children only recently learned of the existence of
financial problems in connection with their father's funeral
expenses and they have taken care of all such obligations. The
children's primary concern has always been that their father's
remains rest in peace, and they loved him.''
   Only family members and a few close friends attended private
services for Lawford on Dec. 26, 1984. Among the mourners were
Lawford's children, Christopher, Sydney, Victoria and Robin.

   Striking scriptwriters and representatives of
the television and movie industry will have another go-round with a
federal mediator, even though two previous sessions produced little
progress.
   ``The chief negotiators have been exploring a possible solution
to the impasse and feel a meeting at this time is in order,'' both
parties said in a joint statement Thursday.
   The meeting, scheduled for Monday, will be the third such
mediated session since the strike began 11 weeks ago. The last
ended after only 20 minutes on April 18, and a meeting March 14
also failed to bring results.
   The 9,000-member Writers Guild of America struck the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers on March 7 over
disagreements on residual payments for reruns, works distributed in
foreign countries and creative control.
   The strike has hobbled the movie and TV industry, forcing many
TV shows into early reruns and stalling movie production.
   Federal mediator Leonard Farrell scheduled the meeting for
Monday afternoon at the alliance's Sherman Oaks headquarters.
   The meeting comes at a time when guild negotiating committees
are believed to be on the verge of signing at least 20 contracts
with independent production companies desperate to resume work.
Another 60 such companies also are negotiating with the guild.
   While the producers face the possibility of some companies
resuming work while others remain idle, the writers sent letters
Wednesday to 11 production companies, including the Walt Disney and
Paramount studios and several soap opera producers, asking for the
names and addresses of replacement scriptwriters they are using.
   The WGA letters appear to be the first major acknowledgement by
the guild that substantial numbers of replacement writers are being
hired to foil their strike.
   ``Your company apparently has employed one or more persons to
perform WGA-covered writing services since the strike began,'' says
the letter, signed by WGA Executive Director Brian Walton. ``The
WGA is entitled under federal labor law to the name and address of
each of these persons. ...''
   ``We are asking for this information fo the purpose of policing
our contract,'' said guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   On Thursday, the alliance announced it would file an unfair
labor practice charge against the guild.
   The union's decision to publicize its letter ``attempted to
coerce writers and the exercise of their legally protected right to
work,'' which is protected under the National Labor Relations Act,
said alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg.

   Weekend performances by Whoopi Goldberg have been

with a high fever, publicists said.
   Ms. Goldberg's spokeswoman, Nannette Leonard, said late Thursday

Goldberg was to join the non-profit Comic Relief organization in

<HEAD>Report Says Rookie Operator Caused Cable Car Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An error by an inexperienced cable car
operator who nevertheless managed to warn his passengers of danger
caused a crash this week that injured 36 people, a federal
investigator said.
   Gerald Bolden, who had been a cable car gripman less than a
month, did not properly tighten the car's grip on the underground
cable, said Mark Garcia, an investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   A lever operated by gripmen clamps metal dies against the cable,
preventing the car from moving faster than 9{ mph, the speed of the
cable.
   The operator's error Monday allowed the car to slip down Hyde
Street, two blocks above Fisherman's Wharf, and to slam into a
truck at a red light, sending some of the 40 tourists and other
passengers flying into the intersection.
   Garcia recommended gripmen be given more training and that
automobiles be banned from the tracks on the two-block stretch
where the accident occurred.
   Garcia said several factors contributed to the accident,
including rain-soaked tracks on the steep hill, the cable car's
outmoded braking system and the fact that cars and trucks also
drive on the tracks.
   He praised the gripman, however, for yelling to passengers
moments before the crash, ``Hold on!''
   Garcia also contradicted reports by witnesses that the car sped
up to 25 mph. The car was traveling no faster than 15 to 18 mph
when it hit the truck, he said.
   William Stead, manager of the city's Municipal Railway, which
operates the cable cars, had no comment on the report. Bolden also
declined to talk to a reporter.
   Meanwhile, a $2 million claim was filed Thursday against the
city on behalf of a couple injured in the crash. The claim, filed
by attorney Melvin Belli for Harry and Lillian Shuttenberg, was the
first stemming from the accident to be submitted to the city
attorney.

   Prosecutors agreed to drop misdemeanor
charges against the parents of a man convicted in a fatal
drunken-driving accident if they joined their son when he speaks to
students as part of his sentence.
   Elaine Cermak, a city councilwoman, and her husband Michael
agreed to participate in the speaking tour as part of the
settlement of charges that they served alcohol to minors at their
daughter's wedding reception.
   Michael Cermak Jr., 20, is serving a three-year sentence after
pleading guilty Feb. 3 to two counts of DUI-manslaughter. The crash
last June 13 killed Sherri Blundell, 18, and Heather Steverson, 17,
as Cermak was driving them home from the reception.
   Cermak's blood-alcohol level was 0.15 percent after the
accident. A person is considered legally intoxicated in Florida
with a level of 0.10 percent.
   His parents were charged last month with two counts each of
contributing to the delinquency of a minor and giving alcoholic
beverages to persons under 21.
   Prosecutors said Wednesday they would drop the misdemeanor
charges against the parents if they joined their son in talking to
students in all Lake County middle and high schools about the
tragedy and their role in it. The speaking tour was part of the
younger Cermak's sentence.
   ``It was a very easy way out of a very difficult situation,''
said Elaine Cermak, 40, who was set to go to trial with her husband
May 23.
   ``We realized that a trial wouldn't have done anyone any good,''
said Mrs. Cermak, who was re-elected to the council last month
before charges against her and her husband were filed.
   ``The agreement was something that made the point for
everyone,'' said State Attorney S. Ray Gill. ``I told my assistants
from the start that we were not out for blood in this situation.''
   The pre-trial agreement signed Wednesday did not include any
plea or any admittance of guilt. Gill said he did not want the
criminal case to interfere with any civil litigation.
   Arthur Blundell is charging in a civil suit that the Cermaks
caused his daughter's death by letting their son get drunk at the
reception.
   The younger Cermak also pleaded guilty to a charge of altering
his driver's license to indicate that he was 21, Florida's drinking
age.
   He has since been enrolled in a 90-day prison program for
youthful offenders. If he completes it, he could be free about July
25. He and his probation officer will then set up his lecture
schedule.

<TEXT>
   The two remaining Democratic
candidates are planning a meeting to discuss strategy and a
platform for their party's national convention, according to one of
the candidates.
   Jesse Jackson told reporters Thursday that he had spoken to
Michael Dukakis by telephone about the meeting, and he said the two
hoped to get together while they are both campaigning in California
prior to the June 7 primary. Both candidates are scheduled to be in
San Francisco today.
   ``We must keep in mind our role is to expand and unify our
party,'' Jackosn said.
   Jackson gave no other details on the meeting.
   Earlier in the day Jackson took his campaign to California's
farmland, telling students to give life a chance without drugs and
agricultural workers to preserve their fields from dangerous
chemicals.
   Jackson gave several scheduled interviews Thursday morning
before embarking on a full day of appearances in Bakersfield and in
Fresno, stressing agricultural themes such as keeping farms in the
family.
   A private fund-raiser netted $50,000 for the Democratic
presidential hopeful, who faces a tough battle in the state's
primary against Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner.
   Jackson also spoke at a ``Latino Salute to Jesse Jackson'' at
the Civic Auditorium in this San Joaquin Valley city 120 miles
north of Los Angeles.
   At a noon rally before a mostly white crowd of 4,000 Kern County
high school students, Jackson blew a kiss and gave a thumbs-up sign
as multi-colored balloons were released into the sky.
   ``I can sense the joy in the air, the sense of hope, the
celebration of people coming together because we care,'' Jackson
said as students clapped and chanted ``Jesse, Jesse'' from the
bleachers at West High School. At one point, Jackson took off his
suit jacket to put on a yellow and green T-shirt bearing a Viking,
the school's mascot.
   Jackson told the students to chant ``I am somebody'' and asked
those who knew of friends who either tried drugs or attempted
suicide to stand.
   ``That's why my heart is heavy and you bring tears to my eyes,''
Jackson said as nearly the entire group stood up. ``You have to
make a big decision today. You have to give life a chance. You have
to give hope a chance.''
   About 100 students who claimed they had tried drugs joined
Jackson on the field afterward.
   ``He's just not talking politics, he made a lot of sense. He's
the first person I've heard (talk about drugs) who I understood,''
said Jennifer, 16, who declined to give her last name.
   Jackson also went to nearby McFarland, a farming town where 12
children have contracted cancer and half of those have died. While
the cause of the cancer is unknown, parents fear agricultural
chemicals played a part.
   ``So long as we poison the environment, and as we contaminate
the water and the air, we will poison the people,'' Jackson said.
   He ended the evening by bringing the audience of 2,500 to its
feet with cries of ``Jackson, action!''
   Jackson appeared relaxed, just two days after a St. Louis couple
was arrested in an alleged assassination plot against him.

<HEAD>Ex-Polish Leader Follows Love to New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former pro-Soviet Polish leader who helped
crush the Solidarity movement later followed the woman he loves to
the United States and lives a quiet, middle-class life here, The
New York Times reported today.
   ``It's almost as if Al Haig or Caspar Weinberger or someone like
that turned up in a dacha outside Moscow,'' Janusz Glowacki, a
Polish playwright now living in New York, told the newspaper.
   Stefan Olszowski, 57, came to the United States in August 1986
because of his love for Zofia Skowron, a Polish international civil
servant, the Times reported. They were married last month and live
in Queens.
   When he left his wife for Ms. Skowron, the scandal shook the
Polish Communist Party and contributed to his ouster as foreign
minister and Politburo member in 1985.
   Ms. Skowron was transferred to the United Nations office in New
York, where she is a liaison officer with UNESCO, and Olszowski
accompanied her. The couple have a 4-year-old son, Nicholas.
   His move to the United States has astounded U.S. Polish experts,
as well as emigres, many of whom left Poland after Solidarity was
suppressed by martial law in December 1981.
   ``It's a remarkable example of moral cynicism and ideological
hypocrisy,'' Zbigniew Brzezinski, a national security adviser in
the Carter administration, told the Times. ``This is a man who,
back home, is a stalwart doctrinarian who favored the bloody use of
force to crush Solidarity.''
   Olszowski, in an interview with the Times, insisted that he was
here just for ``personal reasons.''
   ``I am just a private person,'' he said.
   Olszowski was twice almost installed as the leader of the
Communist Party, in place of Stansilaw Kania, during the 16 months
Solidarity was a legal union and Poland was reeling through a
period of liberalization and crisis.
   Despite his ouster in 1985, he appears to maintain ties to
Poland's top leadership, meeting with visiting officials at the
United Nations, according to the Times.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-government newspaper published
photographs of U.S. Embassy employees and their families so that
Panamanians will ``know the Gringos who are starving us to death.''
   The supplement in the newspaper Critica, a propaganda organ of
the government, said the Americans ``think the walls of their
embassy are impregnable.''
   U.S. Embassy spokesmen said it was a significant escalation of
what they called a harassment campaign by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who is chief of the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense
Forces and controls the civilian government.
   ``We take this seriously,'' embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone
said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   ``Saying `Panamanians, these are your enemies,' and putting it
in a very shrill way in front of a public in which there are known
paramilitary groups is not a very wholesome thing to do. Combined
with the rhetoric, it is cause for concern,'' Kneebone added.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug-trafficking charges in the
United States and the Reagan administration has imposed severe
economic sanctions on Panama in an effort to make him resign.
   A 10-foot-high fence of iron bars surrounds the U.S. Embassy
grounds on seaside Balboa Avenue. The embassy building is about 25
yards from the fence, within easy reach of projectiles from the
street.
   The embassy's physical barriers are almost identical to those of
the U.S. consulate in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, which anti-American
protesters burned and sacked in April.
   The front page of the 36-page supplement published by Critica on
Thursday shows photos of the embassy building, U.S. Ambassador
Arthur Davis and John Maisto, deputy chief of mission. It says in
bold print: ``Panamanian: Know the Gringos who are starving us to
death.''
   A preface to the list of embassy personnel said: ``These are the
ones who think the walls of their embassy are impregnable, that
their computers are infallible.
   ``These are the ones who carry out the strategy of Elliott
Abrams, who wants to kill thousands of Panamanians in order to
impose a docile government that would hand the country over to
Washington.''
   Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
has been a central figure in the Reagan administration's Panama
policy.
   Critica's list of embassy employees includes the names of 85
diplomats and and 64 dependents, most of them spouses. Following
the list are pages of photocopies of identity documents issued to
embassy personnel by the Panamanian government.
   These include photographs, but most are of such poor quality as
to be unrecognizable in newsprint reproduction.
   In all, the documents of 363 embassy personnel and dependents _
including children _ are reproduced, but many are outdated.
   According to Critica, the source of the list and documents was
The Committee for Panamanian Dignity and Sovereignty. It was the
first known public mention of the committee.
   The newspaper, which includes ranking military officers on its
board, said the committee obtained the information from an
``intelligence branch'' that had the cooperation of ``patriotic
Panamanians and North American friends.''
   It said it would provide addresses and telephone numbers of the
Americans in coming days, which Kneebone said would make the matter
``that much more serious.''

   Sinhalese extremists with automatic
weapons fatally wounded a senior official of the governing United
National Party as he left his Colombo home today, police said.
   Two men opened fire with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles as Nandalal
Fernando was being driven to his office, said police inspector G.
Kalupahana. He said the gunmen and a third suspect escaped on a
motorcyle.
   Fernando was shot in the stomach and hand and died three hours
later at a hospital, police officials said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   They said the attack was carried out by the People's Liberation
Front, a group of ultranationalist Sinhalese who have vowed to kill
anyone who supports President Junius R. Jayewardene's efforts to
make peace with the Tamil minority.
   Fernando held the fourth-highest post in Jayewardene's party as
secretary general. The party's chairman was assassinated last
December.
   The government has blamed the People's Liberation Front for the
killings of about 260 government officials and supporters since
July 29, when Sri Lanka and India signed a peace accord to end the
Tamil insurgency.
   Fernando, like Jayewardene, belongs to the Sinhalese ethnic
group that controls the government and comprises 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils, who account for 18 percent, say
they are discriminated against in jobs and education.
   Tamil militants have been waging a guerrilla war against the
government and Sinhalese civilians for nearly five years. The
rebels rejected the peace accord, which provides greater autonomy
in Tamil-populated areas if the guerrillas surrender their weapons.
   Sinhalese militants also reject the accord, saying it gives too
much to the Tamils.
   To enforce the accord, India has sent more than 50,000 soldiers
to Sri Lanka, an island off its southern coast, but Tamil militants
are now fighting the Indian troops.
   On May 10, the government lifted a five-year ban on the People's
Liberation Front's political activities after announcing it had
signed a peace agreement with the Sinhalese radicals.
   The group denied reaching such an agreement and has continued
attacks on Sinhalese politicians.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Hospital To Eliminate Waiting List For AIDS Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a hospital to eliminate a
waiting list for AZT, the only federally approved AIDS drug, and to
begin offering an experimental treatment to indigent patients.
   State District Judge John M. Marshall signed a temporary
restraining order Thursday against Parkland Memorial Hospital after
the Dallas Gay Alliance and five Parkland patients filed a lawsuit
claiming the hospital failed to provide adequate treatment for AIDS
patients.
   The lawsuit also listed seven ``John Doe'' plaintiffs who
Parkland officials say died in recent months while waiting to
receive AZT.
   Marshall ordered a trial within 30 days to determine whether a
special master should be named to monitor Parkland's handling of
AIDS patients.
   ``To whom must the victim turn?'' Marshall said in a strongly
worded statement. ``Obviously, the public must intervene or else
adopt a policy that says, `Let them die because we can't afford
them.' Such a result is not tolerable in a society that for over
200 years has prided itself on placing human values first.''
   William Waybourn, president of the gay alliance, said he is
``gratified that the judge has ruled in favor of life,'' and added,
``It's unfortunate that Parkland did not listen to us before now.''
   Dr. Ron Anderson, Parkland's chief executive officer, said in a
statement after the ruling that the county's only public hospital
must balance the needs of AIDS patients against increasing numbers
of other indigent patients, including pregnant women, elderly
people and trauma victims.
   ``AIDS patients are very ill at times and require compassionate,
humane care that we are doing our best to deliver,'' Anderson said.
   The patients receive treatment at a clinic that Parkland jointly
runs with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The
clinic is providing treatment for 679 patients suffering from AIDS;
AIDS-related complex, a less-serious form of the disease; or the
virus that causes the disease.
   Tom Cox, chief legal counsel for Parkland, said the hospital
intended to comply with Marshall's order. However, he indicated
that AIDS patients still may have a difficult time seeing a doctor
at the clinic.
   ``I can say we will eliminate the (AZT) waiting list, but when
they (AIDS patients) can get an appointment to the clinic and when
they can see a doctor is another issue entirely,'' Cox said.
   The suit accused Parkland of violating state and federal laws by
not providing enough doctors to handle the number of AIDS patients
and by withholding some treatments that are readily available to
patients at other hospitals.
   Parkland officials said they have been unable to find physicians
interested in working at the AIDS clinic.
   There are 20 patients with AIDS-related complex on the waiting
list to receive AZT, said Parkland spokeswoman Esther Bauer. It was
not known how soon those patients would be given the drug, which
has been shown to prolong the lives of some AIDS victims, she said.
   Parkland also must begin offering an experimental drug,
pentamidine isethionate, to AIDS patients, Marshall ruled.

<TEXT>
   A protective cage like those required on
newer buses would not have prevented the fuel tank of a church bus
from being punctured in a fiery crash that claimed 27 lives, the
state fire marshal says.
   Fire Marshal Bill Martin said the location of a three-inch gash
on the front of the 60-gallon tank and pictures of the metal cages
required in newer buses had convinced him that whatever pierced the
tank probably would have passed between the bars of a cage.
   ``In this situation, the way this accident occurred, that cage
would have had little or no effect,'' Martin said in an interview
Thursday.
   The converted school bus owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of
God Church burst into flames after being hit head-on by a pickup
truck traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton on
Saturday night.
   Twenty-seven of the 67 people on board died of smoke inhalation
in one of the nation's deadliest bus crashes. The driver, who was
allegedly drunk, has been charged with 27 counts of murder.
   Jean Fasone, head of the National Transportation Safety Board
team investigating the crash, said Martin's findings could prove
true. The NTSB team will continue trying to determine whether a
cage would have minimized damage to the fuel tank.
   Although his report will not be complete for several weeks,
Martin said the fuel tank probably was punctured by another piece
of the bus.
   In addition to the gash, NTSB investigators reported this week
that the fuel tank had been pushed back 26 inches and off one of
the two straps that fastened it to the bus.
   A protective cage might have held the tank in place, resulting
in an even larger hole, Martin said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Hit Two Sections of the Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms swept across the northern and mid-Atlantic coastal
states as well as the Great Plains and parts of the Rockies today,
unleasing fierce winds, heavy rains and hail the size of tennis
balls.
   In Midland, Texas, the huge hail accumulated a foot deep,
stripping trees of branches and flooding streets. Early this
morning, a thunderstorm dropped two-thirds of an inch of rain in
less than an hour at Abilene, Texas.
   A tornado touched down in southeastern South Dakota, destroying
a machine shed on a farm. In Canton, S.D., a thunderstorm whipped
winds to 50 mph.
   Thunderstorms also struck parts of Nebraska, Kansas, eastern
Colorado, New Mexico and eastern Arizona.
   In the East, a possible tornado was reported just west of
Fayetteville, N.C. Strong thunderstorm winds in northeastern North
Carolina moved a barn 2 feet off its foundation and uprooted a
large pine tree.
   Recent heavy rains in parts of the East caused flooding of
streams and small rivers. Flooding was a danger in south-central
Pennsylvania, where the flood gates on the dam at Fort Ritchie were
opened.
   Flood watches were in effect in much of Pennsylvania, southern
New Jersey, northern Delaware, much of Maryland, northern Virginia
and northeastern West Virginia.
   Meanwhile, skies were clear this morning over the Gulf Coast
states and much of the Mississippi Valley, while the far West also
saw clear skies.
   Today's forecast called for showers in New York, eastern
Pennsylvania and lower Michigan; showers and thunderstorms from
Ohio and western Pennsylvania across the mid-Atlantic states to
North Carolina, also from Minnesota across the Great Plains to the
central and southern Rockies; widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms in southern Florida; and sunny skies over the rest of
the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 60s from New England to
the northern and central Appalachians; in the 50s or 60s from
northern Minnesota across the Dakotas, western portions of the
central Plains, Texas and the central Rockies to Utah and northern
Arizona; 90 in parts of the Southeast; in the 90s from the Rio
Grande Valley of Texas, the desert Southwest and much of
California; and in the 70s or 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 83 degrees at
Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>FBI Nabs Last Two Suspects In $70 Million Bank Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men arrested by federal agents in Detroit are
the last of seven charged in a failed attempt to defraud the First
National Bank of Chicago and three of its customers out of nearly
$70 million, authorities say.
   Leonard Strickland, 49, an attorney, and the Rev. Ronald G.
Carson, 40, were arrested Thursday at their Detroit homes and later
released on $500,000 bond each, the FBI said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Mendeloff said the two were to be
transported to Chicago after a May 27 hearing before a U.S.
magistrate in Detroit.
   Narly $20 million had not been returned to First National by
Thursday. However, officials at the nation's 10th-largest bank
insisted that neither the bank nor the three corporate customers
whose accounts were involved would lose any money as a result of
the sophisticated wire-transfer scheme to transfer money to two
Austrian banks.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said one Austrian bank,
Creditanstalt, through Citibank, its New York correspondent bank,
returned the $49 million transferred from the First National
accounts of Merrill Lynch & Co. and United Airlines.
   But Focobank of Austria and its correspondent bank in New York,
Chase Manhattan, had not returned $19.75 million transferred from
the First National account of Brown-Foreman Corp., a Louisville,
Ky.-based distiller.
   First National filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Focobank, and
U.S. District Judge Vincent Broderick issued an order freezing
Focobank's account. He also set a May 25 hearing on the matter.
   Prosecutors said two First National employees provided the
schemers with confidential code words and security information,
enabling them to transfer the $70 million on May 13 to the New York
banks, and then into the accounts of the two Austrian banks.
   On Monday, an executive in United Airline's finance division
found a ``substantial overdraft'' in reviewing account transactions
from the previous Friday and notified First National, which in turn
alerted federal authorities.
   Four of the other suspects are being held in a federal detention
center, while the fifth, a bank employee, is cooperating with
authorities and is not being held.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Against Most Currencies, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against most currencies in
quiet European trading early today. Gold prices fell a bit in
lackluster trading.
   Dealers said foreign exchange markets were exceptionally quiet
ahead of a three-day weekend for many European countries because of
a holiday on Monday.
   ``It is as dead as a doornail,'' said one trader in Rome.
   One dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said Tuesday's release of
the surprisingly small U.S. trade deficit for March has lifted the
dollar's range a bit but hasn't changed the lackluster character of
the foreign exchange market.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose fractionally to a closing 124.82 yen from 124.80
yen late Thursday. Later, in London, it was quoted slightly higher
at 125.09 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates:
   --1.7046 West German marks, up from 1.6990
   --1.4215 Swiss francs, up from 1.4155
   --5.7725 French francs, up from 5.7542
   --1.9036 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9042
   --1,261.80 Italian lire, down from 1,262.00
   --1.2445 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2442
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost

<HEAD>Seized Research Vessel Likely To be Returned to Owners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research vessel that was part of the Titanic
exploration, seized under the government's ``zero-tolerance''
policy after a small amount of marijuana was found, will probably
be returned to its owners, officials say.
   Atlantis II was seized here Wednesday after a routine inspection
turned up traces of marijuana and two pipes in the shaving kit of
one of the ship's 25 crew members, a U.S. Customs Service spokesman
said Thursday.
   Spokesman Mike Fleming said it was clear the 210-foot vessel's
owners, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole,
Mass., ``were innocent parties. They've been extremely cooperative
in this matter.''
   Crew member Richard Morris, 27, of Buzzards Bay, Mass., pleaded
guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of drug possession, said
Fleming. Morris was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $100.
   The vessel's owners are forwarding a letter to Customs
supporting the anti-drug effort and assuring officials they intend
to tighten security aboard the ship, Fleming said.
   ``Once we receive their agreement and their letter outlining the
procedures they will take, then we fully intend to return the
Atlantis II to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,'' he said.
   Atlantis II and its contents, including a three-person research
submarine named Alvin, are worth $80 million, Fleming said.
   Atlantis II arrived in San Diego Wednesday from Guatemala, where
it had stopped for supplies after geological and biological
research work near the Galapagos Islands, said Derek Spencer, the
institution's director of research.
   The seizure shocked the scientific community at Woods Hole,
where the ship is based, said Spencer.
   Construction of Atlantis II and Alvin was substantially funded
by federal research agencies, Spencer said. He noted that the
25-foot Alvin is owned by the Navy.
   Scientists aboard Atlantis II used Alvin in 1986 to explore and
photograph the North Atlantic site where the Titanic lies.
   The luxury liner went down 74 years ago after striking an
iceberg only five days into its maiden voyage. More than 1,500
people died. Scientists found the Titanic in September 1985 on a
joint U.S.-French expedition.
   At least 22 vessels have been seized across the country since
the zero-tolerance policy went into effect.

   The aircraft plowed into a field about a half-mile from the end
of the runway at Guetersloh airfield, about 45 miles northeast of
Dortmund, he said.
   Flying debris from the crash damaged a farm building near the
site, but there were no injuries on the ground, he said.
   Henatsch said the name of the pilot was being withheld pending
notification of next of kin and an investigation was launched into
what caused the crash.
   There have been several fatal crashes in recent months in West
Germany involving American, British and French military jets.

   Sikh militants left Chinese-made AK-47
rifles, grenades and ammunition inside the Golden Temple when they
surrendered to police following a 10-day siege, a tour of the
shrine showed today.
   Municipal work crews continued to clean debris from the temple
complex, and police reported 20 more people shot to death by Sikh
extremists overnight.
   Five of the victims killed Thursday night were Hindu migrant
workers who were lined up against a wall and shot.
   Reporters taken to the temple found that one of its windows had
been shattered during the confrontation between the extremists and
police. A bullet hole could be seen in the marble near the entrance
to the shrine.
   The weapons were on the floor above the inner sanctum of the
temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine. The siege ended Wednesday when
the last 46 Sikh extremists holed up inside the temple surrendered
to police.
   The Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, lay covered
under a cloth in the inner sanctum on the ground floor. There was a
burn mark across the cloth, which appeared to have been made by a
bullet passing close to its surface.
   In rooms around the pool surrounding the temple, reporters were
shown the militants' supply of tinned butter, wheat and lentils as
well as army uniforms the extremists apparently used to impersonate
servicemen in some of their raids.
   In Room No. 48, the office assigned to the militant All India
Sikh Students Federation, reporters saw files of threatening
letters that had been sent by the group and other militant factions
to Punjab residents. Some demanded money. In other rooms there were
blood-stained clothing, toiletries and medical kits.
   Police said the migrant workers killed Thursday were lined up
against a wall and shot by a gang of eight radicals, the United
News of India reported. The killings occurred in the village of
Chinna Karam Singh, about 18 miles northwest of the Sikh holy city
of Amritsar.
   It was the second attack on migrant workers this week,
suggesting that the estremists were trying to undercut the mainstay
of Punjab state's economy, which is agriculture. Overnight Tuesday,
Sikh gunmen killed more than 30 Hindu workers from Bihar and Orissa
as they slept at a camp near the state capital of Chandigarh.
   Other deaths reported overnight included six people killed in
Jalandhar district, six in Bhatinda district and three other shot
to death in separate incidents around the state.
   The killings raised to at least 1,108 the number of people
killed by Sikh extremists in Punjab since the start of the year. In
all of 1987, about 1,030 people died.
   Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
more political autonomy or an independent homeland in Punjab, where
they are a majority. Sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of India's
800 million people and claim they are discriminated against by the
nation's majority Hindus.
   State-run All India Radio today quoted an unidentified
government official in Amritsar as saying cleaning was nearly
complete at the Golden Temple and ``steps are being taken to
restore traditional rituals.''
   Police cordoned off the complex May 9 after radicals inside
fired on police officers conducting an inspection outside its
walls, wounding five of them.
   Rituals at the golden-domed temple include a continuous reading
of the Sikh holy book and the singing of hymns. Sikhism was founded
500 years ago as an alternative to Hinduism and Islam.
   Visitors to the inner sanctum of the temple often take a
ceremonial dip in the surrounding pool, which is considered sacred.

   Radical students stormed the U.S.
Embassy compound today, hurled six crude homemade bombs and wounded
a police officer in the fourth day of clashes between
anti-government protesters and police.
   Students staged demonstrations and marches today at colleges in
Seoul and other cities to demand the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo and removal of U.S. troops. Many protests were peaceful,
but some turned into battles with police in green combat fatigues
and black-visored helmets.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and ``Drive out the
Yankee imperialists!'' protesters shouted.
   Students hurling firebombs and rocks battled police around at
least three colleges in Seoul and one in the southern city of
Kwangju.
   Police fired tear gas and formed walls of shields to stop
protesters from marching into the streets.
   Eight students were arrested today in Suwon, south of Seoul,
when they stormed an office of the governing Democratic Justice
Party with firebombs and sticks. Riot police overpowered the
attackers.
   Students carrying a South Korean flag and banners denouncing the
government and the United States scaled the walls of the U.S.
Embassy compound and others rushed the gate, police said.
   They threw six bombs at police guards. One officer was hurt when
four of the devices exploded. The officer was hospitalized with
wounds, police said.
   The intruders ran around the embassy compound for several
minutes, shouting ``Drive out the U.S.!'' and scattering leaflets
before riot police overpowered and arrested seven protesters.
Witnesses said some of the protesters got away.
   The state-run Korean Broadcast System said one student was
injured by a policeman armed with an iron bar, but police said they
could not confirm the report.
   U.S. Embassy officials said the bombs did not damage the
building and no American personnel was hurt. Police said the bombs
were crude chemical explosives packed in soft drink cans.
   Radical groups called for a march in Seoul on Saturday to
denounce the government. Opposition church groups also called for
peaceful protests.
   Police remained on nationwide alert, and riot squads stood guard
at key locations in Seoul or waited out of sight in side streets.
   Protesters have denounced the United States in demonstrations
this week, charging that Washington supports military dictatorship
in South Korea.
   Leaders of the radical students, who represent an important
campus minority, want Seoul to end its alliance with Washington and
expel the 40,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   On Thursday, protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at
the Seoul office of the U.S. Information Agency. The center was
seized in February by radicals who exploded several bombs that
caused minor damage.
   Radical groups reject broad democratic reforms made by the Roh
government since it took power in February. They contend South
Korea is not a democracy and demand a nationwide revolt.
   Many Koreans distrust Roh because of the role he played in the
authoritarian government of former President Chun Doo-hwan, whom he
succeeded.Roh narrowly won the presidency in a December electoral
victory over two candidates who split the opposition vote.
   This week's political violence has been the worst since
nationwide riots last summer. In major clashes in Seoul and other
cities, thousands of students and dissidents threw firebombs and
rocks at riot police, who used volleys of tear gas to scatter the
protesters.
   The protests this week were called to mark the anniversary of an
anti-government uprising in Kwangju on May 18, 1980.
   Some opposition groups contend Roh, as a top general then,
played a leading role in the bloody suppression of the Kwangju
uprising, in which at least 191 people were killed. Radicals demand
that Roh be punished for the incident.

   A man accused of attacking five women was
convicted of rape after the victims identified him as their
assailant by listening to his tape-recorded voice.
   Scott Carroll, 27, a New York City factory worker, was found
guilty Thursday of 31 charges in a 54-count indictment, including
four rapes and one attempted rape.
   The jury, which deliberated for 10 days, deadlocked on 21
charges, including one rape, an attempted rape and robbery. He was
acquitted on two burglary charges.
   Carroll displayed no emotion when the verdict was announced.
   His attorney, Eric Naiburg, conceded during the six-week trial
that one man committed all the crimes but contended that police had
arrested the wrong man. He said he would appeal the conviction.
   In most of the incidents, the assailant wore a mask or it was
too dark to see his face, the victims testified.
   According to Prosecutor Michael Ahearn, Carroll stalked his
victims for days, confronted them in their bedrooms as they slept
and put a screwdriver to their throats. Usually, the victims were
blond and attractive, ranging in age from 10 to 55.
   The attacks at homes on Long Island's affluent South Shore began
in January 1983 and ended in February 1987, when Carroll was
arrested.
   He faces a maximum of 25 years on each rape conviction, and
Ahearn said he would request the maximum on each count to run
consecutively. Suffolk County Judge Stuart Namm set sentencing for
June 22.
   Six victims, four of rape and two of attempted rape, picked
Carroll from a ``voice lineup'' by listening to recordings of his
voice and other male voices and identifying his as that of the man
who had attacked them.
   Mario Puzo, the author of ``The Godfather,'' also testified that
his Bay Shore home was burglarized in 1986 and that several pieces
of luggage were stolen. Luggage given to Carroll's girlfriend was
identified by Puzo as belonging to him.
   Naiburg pointed to discrepancies in the descriptions victims
gave of their assailant's voice. Some said he spoke with a thick
New York accent. At least one recalled the voice of an educated man
with no accent.
   Naiburg directed the bulk of his defense against the ``voice
lineup,'' calling it prejudicial and flawed.

   A school bus overturned on a sharp curve called ``Devil's
Elbow'' and plunged down an embankment in Pennsylvania, injuring 60
people, and another school bus flipped in Iowa, injuring 34
fifth-graders and others.
   Both accidents occurred Thursday afternoon.
   In the accident about 90 miles north of Harrisburg, Pa., the bus
went off the curve, fell about 20 feet and landed upside down,
police said.
   The bus, carrying 45 children and 15 adult chaperones from the
Walnut Street Christian School in Jersey Shore, was returning from
a field trip in Harrisburg.
   Sixteen children and eight adults were treated at Divine
Providence Hospital in Williamsport, nursing supervisor Margaret
Herz said. An adult passenger and a child were hospitalized in fair
condition today, but most of the other injuries were minor.
   Twenty-nine children and seven adults were treated at two other
area hospitals, mostly for bumps, scrapes and bruises, officials
said.
   State police said the driver was unfamiliar with the state road,
which he had taken to avoid a traffic tie-up, and said speed may
have contributed to the accident.
   ``He didn't know the turn was there,'' Trooper Allen Green said.
   In the Iowa crash, 63 people escaped serious injury when their
bus overturned on a county road south of Albion. Thirty-four
passengers were treated at hospitals in Marshalltown and Waterloo
for minor lacerations, bruises and fractures, then released,
officials said.
   The bus was carrying 58 students, two parent chaperones, two
teachers and a driver from Living History Farms near Des Moines
when it slipped off the pavement onto a muddy shoulder.
   The bus flipped on its side and skidded about 40 feet before
stopping on the edge of an embankment.
   ``We were turning the corner and the bus driver started yelling
and the back tires went off the road. Everybody started hollering
and we ran out the back,'' said Quentin Bolden, who said he was
sitting six rows from the front.
   Lowell Elementary School principal Bill Dodd traveled to Albion
to calm the youngsters.
   ``We're taking some of them home in vans because they're afraid
to ride the bus,'' Dodd said.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Janos Kadar
today said the party was responsible for Hungary's economic crisis
but criticized what he said were attempts to undermine the party's
control of the country.
   In a speech opening the first national party conference in 31
years, Kadar acknowledged Hungary's deep economic and social crisis
and said party delegates should ``renew and rejuvenate'' the party
leadership.
   The conference delegates will consider changes in Hungary's
leadership, including the possible replacement of Kadar.
   Kadar, 75, made no direct reference to speculation he will
relinquish the party leadership he has held since 1956. He mounted
a strong attack on reformers who want to see sweeping political and
economic change.
   ``The party condemns independent efforts, even by
well-intentioned people, to weaken the party and youth movements,''
Kadar noted, alluding to the formation last week of communist
Hungary's first independent trade union and recent efforts to set
up an unofficial democratic youth group.
   ``The party will not give way to hostile actions challenging the
social order,'' Kadar said in his address, which was carried by
state-run media.
   He said the party's task is to create socialism that involves
more democracy, but rejected what he called ``efforts to create a
bourgeois democracy, or anarchy.''
   Kadar addressed the party's failure to straighten out the
nation's economic crisis.
   ``No qualitative changes have taken place in our economy,
restructuring is sluggish, and the internal and external financial
balance has deteriorated,'' he said.
   ``As a consequence, conditions are lacking for perceptibly
raising the living standard, and even for safeguarding it in all
respects.
   ``Dissatisfaction has increased, and more people are pessimistic
about the future and confidence in the party and its leaders has
declined,'' Kadar said.
   Last week, the party's policy-making Central Committee said
personnel changes would be high on the agenda of the national party
conference, fueling speculation Kadar's era might be coming to a
close.
   Even Premier Karoly Grosz, a leading contender for the party
chief's post, has suggested that the conference might replace Kadar.
   Central Comittee member Janos Barabas told reporters Thursday
that the conference's 990 delegates would have the opportunity ``to
create a new leadership if they want to.''
   He said a personnel committee would be chosen today to make
recommendations for possible changes in the 105-member Central
Committee.
   Barabas said any leadership changes would be announced on
Sunday. Without elaborating, he said the Central Committee would
vote on the post of party leader.
   Barabas said conference delegates also would discuss ``ways to
speed and broaden economic reforms to every segment of the
country.''
   Kadar has been widely criticized for resisting political reforms
needed to lift Hungary's economy out of stagnation.
   ``Kadar has come to personify the mistakes that have been made
in the past,'' said a party official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``No real change can occur as long as he remains on
top.''
   Kadar pioneered reforms that made Hungary relatively prosperous
in the late 1960s and 1970s, but a series of recent economic
setbacks and austerity measures have angered many Hungarians.
   Some party members say political reforms Kadar has proposed,
including provisions for secret ballots, limited terms of office
for party officials and multi-candidate elections, do not go far
enough.
   A gross foreign debt of more than $17 billion and growing
inflation led Hungary's leaders this year to impose Eastern
Europe's first personal income and value added taxes.
   Meanwhile, an opposition confederation called on the Communist
Party to end its political monopoly, reinstitute parliamentary rule
and freedom of the press and lift state controls on the economy.
   The recently formed Network of Free Initiatives, which comprises
environmental, political, youth and other independent groups,
released its manifesto Thursday at a news conference.

   Gov. Roy Romer will address Agate High School
graduates on Sunday. Both of them.
   Romer's office announced Thursday that the governor will deliver
the commencement address at 2 p.m. in the school gymnasium at
Agate, a tiny farming community about 90 miles east of here.
   The two graduates are Penny Robbins and Richard Padilla.
   ``I came from a small school on the Eastern Plains. I know how
it feels,'' Romer said. ``I simply wanted to send a message that
these two graduates are equally as important as a graduating class
of 2,000. Size doesn't count. Quality and effort are what is
important.''
   Also participating in the ceremony will be five eighth graders
who officially will complete junior high school and enter high
school.
   Marjorie L. Becker, the superintendent of Agate Public School
District 300, said the 1987 graduating class at Agate High also had
just two graduates.

Thursday evening at the Balmoral Show Grounds, where thousands of
people were attending the annual Royal Ulster Agricultural Show.
   One policeman remained hospitalized today with burns, but the
others, including four children, were released after treatment,
police said.
   The explosion set off a fire in the police recruitment stand,
sending the crowds fleeing in fear.
   In a statement to Belfast news media, the IRA said the explosion
was caused by a 7-pound bomb placed under an office adjacent to the
police stand.
   Initial press reports said police believed the explosion was
caused not by a bomb but by a leak in a malfunctioning gas cylinder.
   But a police spokesman, Inspector Jim Robinson, said police were
not ruling out the possibility of a bombing. He said forensic
experts were still examining debris.
   The IRA accused the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's
mainly Protestant police force, of ``attempting to cover their
acute embarrassment (over not detecting the bomb) by releasing
disinformation to the media'' about the cause of the explosion.
   The IRA said it carried out the attack because the agricultural
fair _ the province's biggest such attraction of the year _ ``is
one of the jewels in the crown of Britain's normalization policy
and is protected by a massive Crown police force ... ''
   The province's security forces are the main targets of the IRA
in its guerrilla campaign to oust the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Cellular Phone Sales Boom After Service Disruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cellular telephone companies are enjoying a
``fire sale'' boom because of a blaze at an Illinois Bell switching
center that disrupted phone service for thousands of customers in
Chicago's western suburbs.
   ``It's been a hectic time, but we did enjoy some pretty good
business out of it,'' said Jerry Greenberg, president of Leader
Communications Inc. of Bellwood. ``Cellular telephones were a
lifesaver for many people ... who were not content to sit dead in
the water and had to have some communications.''
   Greenberg estimated sales have doubled since the May 8 fire that
ravaged a key Illinois Bell facility in Hinsdale.
   He said his company couldn't have operated without its own
cellular phones and portable facsimile machines, which were used to
place equipment orders when regular long-distance service was
interrupted.
   An Illinois Bell spokesman said all 35,000 customers in six
western suburbs where customers' phones went dead after the fire
should have some local phone service by Saturday, but will still
have difficulty calling outside their communities.
   As of Thursday, Bell workers had restored limited service to
31,000 of the subscribers, said company spokesman Tim Bannon.
   Bell expects that regional and long-distance lines and special
business lines transmitting computer data that were routed through
the Hinsdale center should be functioning almost normally by
Saturday, Bannon said.
   John Prescott, sales manager for the Cellular Communications
Corp. of Naperville, said cellular phone sales had tripled to 150
per week and profits had doubled since the fire.
   His customers included panic-stricken business people as well as
fence-sitters who moved up plans to buy cellular portable or car
phones.
   ``We probably did three times the business in a week that we
normally do ... and had to add on four workers,'' Prescott said.
   Pat Graham, marketing manager for Ameritech Mobile
Communications Service in Schaumburg said the phone outage boosted
an already booming market for cellular phones.
   ``Sales are better now than they've ever been in the company's
four-year history,'' said Ms. Graham. So far, sales over the first
two weeks of May in the Chicago area have already exceeded the
company's forecast for the entire month, she said.

<HEAD>Australia On Standby To Evacuate Its Nationals From Vanuatu</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that the
political situation remains unstable in Vanuatu and put two
warships on standby near the island nation of to evacuate
Australians if necessary.
   One person was killed and nine injured this week in rioting over
land reform in the South Pacific tax-haven nation and offshore
banking center.
   The Foreign Ministry advised tourists not to visit Vanuatu and
the Defense Ministry ordered the warships Stalwart and Jervis Bay
to extend training exercises in the area and be prepared for a
possible evacuation.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke repeated his statement that Libya was
linked to Monday's rioting in the Vanuatu capital, Port Vila, but
offered no proof. Libya denied involvement.
   News reports said about 750 Australians, residents and visitors,
were in Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides. The mainly
Melanesian island nation of 130,000 people is roughly 1,400 miles
northeast of Sydney.
   Monday's demonstration turned violent when a mob marched on
Prime Minister Walter Lini's office. Demonstrators looted shops and
smashed office windows, causing an estimated $1 million in damage,
Radio Vanuatu reported today.
   The radio said villagers involved in the demonstration had begun
surrendering to police. It gave no details. One demonstrator was
killed when a police vehicle ran over him. Police arrested 30
people.
   Within hours of the trouble, Australia and New Zealand flew
supplies of riot control gear to Vanuatu at Lini's request.
   Australia's Foreign Ministry said today that there was a
possibility of a confrontation this weekend between Lini and the
general secretary of his governing Vanu'uka Parti.
   Australian media reports said the general secretary, Barak Sope,
was behind Monday's demonstration and Hawke said a number of people
around Sope ``have actually been trained in Libya and that is a
matter of concern.''
   Sope last year tried unsuccessfully to gain leadership of
Vanuatu, asserting Lini was unfit for the job after suffering a
debilitating stroke.
   Vanuatu rattled the nerves of generally pro-Western South
Pacific nations with its 1986 decision to establish diplomatic ties
with Libya and the Soviet Union. Since then, Sope's supporters have
visited Libya for what diplomats here described as unspecified
training.
   On Thursday, Libya's state-run JANA news agency quoted an
unidentified Libyan Foreign Minitry official in Tripoli as denying
Hawke's charges.
   Vanuatu was administered jointly by Britain and France from 1906
until 1980, when it achieved independence.

   The 9-year-old boy stole the keys to his
father's bus and went on a careening joyride through his
neighborhood, smashing into cars, a tree and a house as startled
residents tried to stop him.
   The bus finally came to rest in a trailer park. The boy and a
10-year-old friend were treated for minor injuries, but noone else
was hurt.
   ``He took the keys out of his mother's purse and just went for a
joyride,'' said Shelley Hanchett, who works with the boy's mother.
The boy's father drives a 23-passenger bus used to transport
special education students; the bus was severely damaged in the
incident Wednesday.
   ``I heard tires squealing and saw it coming down the street and
it sideswiped my car. It then turned the corner ... on two wheels
and disappeared. I tried to get the license plate number, but it
was going too fast,'' said Reaba Collins.
   The bus sideswiped two parked cars. It turned north, then east
and hit a pickup truck. Then it crossed a street and ripped limbs
from a tree in the front yard of a house.
   ``I saw it hit the tree so I ran out of the house toward the bus
to open its door,'' said Joyce Davis, who was visiting in the
house. ``It backed up and came toward me, so I ran. It then hit the
house. His eyes were wide open. He looked scared.''
   Richard Edwards said he ran out of his house after watching the
bus hit a street sign.
   ``I ran out and tried to reach in the window to stop the kid,
but he started changing gears and sped off,'' said Edwards, adding
that the boy locked the doors when another man tried to reach in
the window.
   Steve Goodwin said he was painting his house when he saw the bus
coming down the street.
   ``The bus finally came to a stop after he hit the last car. He
just let go of the steering wheel and stood up,'' Goodwin said.
   The 10-year-old had been hiding under a seat, Goodwin said. The
two boys then wandered around the bus because they couldn't get out
of the jammed doors, he said.
   ``The driver kept saying, `I can't let my mom catch me now,''
Goodwin said.

<HEAD>Amal Claims Hezbollah Tried to Swap Hostage for Weapons</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Amal saying it blocked attempt
to swap hostage for weapons. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mainstream Amal militia said today
that it blocked an attempt by the rival pro-Iranian Hezbollah to
swap a foreign hostage for weapons and ammunition from Christian
militias.
   ``Amal has thwarted an attempt by Hezbollah to turn over a
foreign hostage to the (Christian) Lebanese Forces (militia) in
return for ammunition and weapons for Hezbollah's besieged base in
Hajjaj Street,'' said Atif Aoun, a member of Amal's politburo.
   Aoun told about 10,000 supporters of the Syrian-backed Shiite
Moslem Amal militia in the southern town of Zahrani that Amal
foiled the alleged swap ``after we found out about the contacts
between Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces.'' He did not elaborate.
   Groups affiliated with Hezbollah, or Party of God, are believed
to hold most of the 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans,
in Lebanon.
   Aoun did not say whether one particular hostage or nationality
was involved in the alleged deal.
   Hezbollah's base is in Hajjaj Street, in south Beirut's Shiyah
district.
   Positions of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia are in the
district of Ein Rummaneh, east of Hajjaj Street.
   The two districts have been separated by a 25-yard-deep
no-man's-land since the Lebanese civil war broke out in 1975.
   There was no way to verify the report independently, and neither
the Lebanese Forces nor Hezbollah had any immediate comment.
   Aoun made the charge as Amal, Arabic for hope, and Hezbollah
battled for a 15th day in the slums of south Beirut, where the
Western hostages are believed held.
   Syrian forces, massed around the disputed area since Saturday,
were threatening to move in and stop the fighting.
   A representative of a Seattle-based human rights group arrived
in Lebanon to try to meet with a Shiite Moslem religious leader and
deliver a petition that calls for the release of foreign hostages.
   In addition, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon
Walters, arrived in the Syrian capital of Damascus today to try to
secure the release of the American hostages.
   Walters, speaking to reporters Thursday in Jerusalem, said his
Middle East mission was prompted by concerns about the hostages'
safety in the face of the intense Amal-Hezbollah fighting. He
refused to elaborate.
   Police said seven people were killed and 38 wounded in today's
exchanges. That raises the toll to at least 251 people killed and
810 wounded since May 6, when the battles broke out.
   On Thursday, Amal leader Nabih Berri, who is also Lebanon's
justice minister, announced a sweeping purge of the militia's
military command. Amal said in a statement that Berri fired the
militia's top military commander, Akel Hamieh, and five senior
aides.
   The statement did not give a reason. However, a ranking Amal
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the six were
fired for ``conspiring with Hezbollah in south Beirut.
   Syria deployed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks on the southern,
western and northern edges of south Beirut over the weekend after
Hezbollah seized about 90 precent of the enclave from Amal.
   Syrian officers have said they were delaying a decision to move
into south Beirut until diplomatic efforts have been exhausted.
   Clashes persisted despite efforts by Iran's acting foreign
minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, to arrange a truce.
   Besharati on Thursday softened his earlier opposition to Syrian
military intervention.
   ``If the entry of the Syrian forces to the suburbs guarantees
security, we will not object,'' Besharati told reporters after
meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's principal
Arab ally in the Persian Gulf war against Iraq. However, Damascus
has become increasingly alarmed by Iran's efforts to dominate
Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the largest single sect.
   Ray Barnett, a Protestant clergyman from Canada representing the
Seattle-based Friends in the West, a Christian human rights group,
arrived in the port of Jounieh today.
   Barnett said he hoped to meet with Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual guide of Hezbollah, to deliver a petition
bearing 40,000 signatures from the United States and Britain.
   In the United States, former hostage David Jacobsen said
Wednesday the petition was expected to be delivered this weekend.
Jacobsen said the petition reads:
   ``As believers in Almighty God we have faith that prayer is more
powerful than armies or contingents of diplomats. Because of this
we respectfully ask you to pray with us and to do whatever you can
to intercede on behalf of all these hostages and captives.''

<HEAD>Authorities Say Physicians Got Kickbacks in Medicare Fraud Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,000 physicans in Pennsylvania and
New Jersey received kickbacks as part of a Medicare fraud scheme
involving a medical laboratory company, say federal officials.
   It is believed to be the nation's largest Medicare fraud case in
terms of the number of doctors involved, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney James G. Sheehan.
   The 987 doctors were paid a $50 kickback by Medical Diagnostic
Services Inc. for each patient referred to the company for a blood
circulation test, Sheehan said.
   The U.S. attorney's office has mailed letters to 382 of the
doctors over the last two days requesting they pay the government
three times the amount they allegedly received in order to avoid
civil action and expulsion from the Medicare program, Sheehan said.
   The 382 doctors received a total of $200,000 in fees, or an
average of about $523. Most of them were calling to offer to settle
the claims, Sheehan said.
   Many of the remaining doctors received less than $150 and are
not expected to be pursued in the case, The Philadelphia Inquirer
reported today, citing unidentified federal sources. Fewer than 100
physicians received more than $5,000 apiece in fees and are
expected to be prosecuted individually, the newspaper said.
   Medical Diagnostic Services billed Medicare $400 to $1,000 per
patient, contending that it had performed a sophisticated test when
in fact it had conducted only a simple, routine test, Sheehan said.
   ``This is a classic Medicare rip-off,'' one investigator
familiar with the case, which is being investigated by the
Inspector General's Office of the Department of Health and Human
Services, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia,
told the Inquirer.
   Between August 1982 and February 1985, Medical Diagnostic
Services, operating under four different corporate names in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, billed Medicare for about $4.5 million,
the newspaper said.
   In July 1987, the owners of Medical Diagnostic Services, Richard
P. Brill and Bruno F. Cortese, each pleaded guilty to one count of
mail fraud in defrauding the Medicare system and agreed to
cooperate with federal prosecutors.

   A police officer who was suspended after she
reported to work with purple hair and a matching purple dress is
trying to get paid for the five days she missed and have the
incident washed off her record.
   Nancy Murphy was charged with willfully disobeying an order _ to
change the color of her hair.
   Covering the purple top with a wig was insufficient, especially
because Murphy did that two days after the order, a police hearing
attorney said.
   Donald Stolberg, an attorney for members of the Detroit Police
Officers Association, said Murphy was blameless in the August 1985
incident.
   ``She didn't order her beautician to turn her hair purple,''
Stolberg said. ``Rather, it was a catastrophe; she was mortified.''
   Stolberg said Murphy tried to comply with the order, but Lt. Joe
McCarroll, representing the Police Department, said Murphy ``had
purple hair and wore a purple dress and came to work like that.''
   There was no immediate decision on Murphy's appeal to the police
hearing board.

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's that time of year when the networks
announce their fall schedules, and Fox Broadcasting Co. is right in
there with the big guys a year after it first started offering
original, prime-time programming.
   Fox's president for programming, Garth Ancier, announced
Thursday that FBC will expand its weekend programming to Monday in
the spring of 1989 with a ``Fox Movie of the Week.''
   Meanwhile, Ancier said, Fox has renewed its ``very successful''
Sunday night lineup of ``21 Jump Street,'' ``America's Most
Wanted,'' ``Married ... With Children,'' ``It's Garry Shandling's
Show,'' ``Duet'' and ``The Tracey Ullman Show.''
   Saturday will be all new in the fall, depending on the end of
the strike by the Writers Guild of America, with a new show from
producer Stephen J. Cannell, ``City Court,'' which will follow
cases from ``21 Jump Street'' through the court system, and
``Angels '88,'' a kind of ``Charlie's Angels'' descendant from
Aaron Spelling Productions.
   Until ``Angels'' premieres later this year, Fox will fill in on
Saturdays beginning this summer with a newsmagazine, ``Page One.''
   Fox canceled ``Werewolf'' and ``Boys Will Be Boys.'' ``The Dirty
Dozen'' is not on the fall schedule, but has not been canceled and
might be brought back after its run this summer. ``Family Double
Dare'' is not on the schedule, but hasn't exactly been canceled yet.
   Like the big three networks, the start of Fox's fall season
could be delayed because of the strike.
   The Monday movie night will be delayed until 1989 because of
uncertainty about the strike, but Ancier said Fox has obtained such
theatrical releases as ``Predator,'' ``Black Widow'' and ``The
Fly'' that can be shown in the time period until original
programming is ready.
   Fox, owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, made its debut in
October 1986 with the ill-fated ``The Late Show'' starring Joan
Rivers. The weekend prime-time schedule was added in April 1987.
   Fox has about 100 affiliated stations, less than half the number
the big three networks have. Fox shows started out with ratings in
the twos and threes. But ``Married ... With Children,'' Fox's
highest-rated show last week, had a 6.0, below the lowest-rated
network show, which last week was ABC's ``Supercarrier,'' with a
6.3. The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million U.S. homes with
television.
   Ancier predicted that the Sunday lineup will improve by a rating
point in the coming season, but withheld predictions on the rest of
the lineup.
   Here is Fox's projected schedule:
   Fall 1988:
   Saturday _ ``City Court,'' ``Angels '88.''
   Sunday _ ``21 Jump Street,'' ``America's Most Wanted,''
``Married ... With Children,'' ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,''
``Duet,'' ``The Tracey Ullman Show.''
   Spring 1989:
   Monday _ ``Fox Movie of the Week.''

<TEXT>
   An Israeli official said Abraham Sofaer, the
U.S. State Department legal adviser, took archaeological artifacts
out of Israel without a required government permit.
   Uri Dahari, head of the archeological robbery prevention section
at Israel's Department of Antiquities, said on Thursday that Sofaer
bought the artifacts from an underground dealer and took them out
of the country without a special permit required from the Israeli
agency.
   The Education Ministry said Sofaer was being investigated but
did not give further details.
   A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said investigators would contact Sofaer but as far as he knew, the
U.S. official would not be prosecuted.
   ``What is clear to us is that Abraham Sofaer violated the law,''
Dahari told Israel army radio Thursday.
   The U.S. State Department said Thursday night that the Israeli
government was not pursuing any investigation. Spokesman Dennis
Harter said Israel has announced ``there is nothing to the
allegation which warrants any action.''
   Sofaer could not be reached for comment, a secretary in his
Washington office said.
   Dahari said his department would view the return of the
artifacts as the end of the incident.
   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted an unidentified aide to
Sofaer as saying the U.S. official purchased arifacts only from
licensed dealers and was willing to return any artifacts found to
have been removed illegally.
   Sofaer was in Israel recently to help settle an Israeli-Egyptian
border dispute.
   David Matnai, minister-counselor for political affairs at the
Israeli Embassy in Washington, said the investigation was over and
that the matter ``was blown out of proportion. I think it was
something minor.''
   Dahari said the activity came to light in an investigation of
several people who were allegedly raiding archeological sites.
   One of those under investigation claimed he sold coins and other
artifacts to Sofaer, Dahari said.

   Demonstrators today smashed five police
cars and ripped down the plaque of Taiwan's legislature in clashes
with authorities, police said. More than 40 people were reported
injured.
   About 3,000 protesters demanding government assistance for
farmers chanted slogans and marched through Taipei streets before
the battles, which marked the worst protest violence since the
government eased restrictions on demonstrations last year.
   Farmers from central Taiwan and members of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party hurled rocks and clubs at 200 riot
police who blocked the entrance to the Legislative Yuan.
   After police dragged three protesters inside, demonstrators
stormed the police lines, broke several windows and tore down the
``Legislative Yuan'' plaque on the building, the home of Taiwan's
highest lawmaking body.
   Police beat back the protesters with clubs and rocks and
dispersed the crowd with water cannons. But it regrouped and
marched to the headquarters of the governing Nationalist Party
headquarters to demand the release of the three protesters.
   Police blocked the way to the party office with barbed-wired
barricades. More clashes were reported outside the party
headquarters and a police station.
   Protest leaders reported at least 10 protesters were injured,
while police said about 20 officers and 12 reporters were hurt,
including six people who were hospitalized. Ten demonstrators were
arrested, police said.
   The violence halted traffic on the main streets of downtown
Taipei for several hours.
   Protesters said the government has helped industry but has
ignored farmers, who have suffered because of low crop prices. One
protest banner read: ``Our president holds a doctoral degree in
agriculture, but farmers are suffering.''
   The United Daily News reported today that President Lee
Teng-hui, an expert in agricultural economics, has instructed
officials to stress the administration is determined to take care
of farmers.
   Reporters at the scene said the fighting was more severe than a
1986 incident in which police kept huge crowds from marching on the
international airport to greet dissident Hsu Hsi-liang.

<HEAD>Former Temptations Singer Found Guilty of Using Cocaine</HEAD>

   Former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin has
been found guilty of using cocaine after being jailed for failing
to appear at his trial.
   Detroit Recorder's Court Judge John O'Brien ruled Thursday there
wasn't enough evidence to convict Ruffin of a cocaine possession
charge, but did find him guilty of using the drug.
   Ruffin faces up to a year in jail at his sentencing, scheduled
for May 31. The singer was being held in Wayne County Jail pending
a hearing on his failure to appear earlier this week.
   He failed to appear for court dates Monday and Tuesday morning
and was arrested on a bench warrant when he showed up in Recorder's
Court late Tuesday.
   Ruffin, 47, originally was charged with possessing a trace of
cocaine after a July 28, 1987, raid on a friend's home. A
co-defendant testified that he and Ruffin were among seven people
who pitched in to buy 42 grams of crack cocaine. Ruffin, who lives
near Detroit in South Lyon, said he went to the house to find a
friend, not to buy drugs. But he admitted Thursday that he had used
cocaine recently after O'Brien threatened to force him to take a
drug test.
   Ruffin, who turned down an offer to plead guilty to a lesser
charge, sang with the Temptations, a top Motown group, from 1963 to
1968. He has recently been performing with another former
Temptation, Eddie Kendricks.

<HEAD>Iran Reiterates It Is At War With United States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS five grafs to UPDATE with Rafsanjani saying women
improperly dressed and blaming U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>

   An Iranian leader today reiterated
statements that his nation is at war with the United States and
called for an arms buildup to confront America.
   ``The Americans have officially entered into a war with us,''
said parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani. ``We are really at war
with the United States at the present time.''
   Rafsanjani, quoted by Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency, made the remarks during a meeting with officials of the
Revolutionary Guards Corps. The agency was monitored in Nicosia.
   Later in the day, he told Moslem prayer worshipers that if the
United States fought Iran, ``they must wait to receive lots of
their youths' dead bodies.''
   It was not the first time Iranian leaders have made such
statements. They have said before that their country is at war with
the United States, especially after American military strikes
against Iranian offshore platforms in the Persian Gulf.
   Rafsanjani, who is close to Iranian revolutionary patriarch
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also repeated previous accusations
that the United States participated in a recent Iraqi attack on
Iran's Larak island oil terminal.
   ``U.S. ships guided Iraqi forces and caused trouble for our
defensive forces,'' he said.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   Rafsanjani said the United States had been ``active in providing
financial and propaganda support for Iraq since the beginning of
the war and is itself responsible for this crime (the war).''
   He said Iran was no longer just at war with Iraq, but also
``with global arrogance,'' a common reference to the United States.
   ``We, too, should increase our military strength ... in order to
take more effective and important steps on the war fronts,'' he
said.
   On April 18, a statement by the Supreme War Council, which
determines Iran's war strategy, called on all Iranians to fight the
United States.
   On the same day a Foreign Ministry statement warned the United
States to expect a severe response from the people of Iran,
alleging that American military helicopters fought on the Iraqi
side in Iraq's recapture of the Faw peninsula from Iran.
   In October 1987, Iran's United Nations ambassador, Said
Rajaie-Khorassani, told reporters in New York: ``We think we are at
war. We think we are being killed by the Americans.''
   Rafsanjani also complained today that some women in Iran were
not covering their bodies sufficiently and blamed the United
States. He appeared to be saying that women were not wearing the
head-to-toe covering called the chador.
   ``America is ... influencing women not to cover themselves the
way they should according to Islam,'' Rafsanjani said on Tehran
Radio. ``But women who commit such crimes must beware that our
nation will not tolerate them.''
   He did not spell out what punishment might await them, but last
week, the Supreme Judicial Council approved a law under which
people who offend ``public morals'' will receive 74 lashes of the
whip.
   The offenses were not spelled out. Under Iran's Islamic
government, even husbands and wives are forbidden to kiss or show
physical affection in public and this is the kind of action usually
referred to as offending public morality.
   In 1963, Rafsanjani organized riots against Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's plan to give new rights to women. He and other clergymen
who are now top Iranian leaders have consistently opposed
Western-style rights for women.

   The prosecutor responsible for
convicting reputed cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas says the
powerful Medellin Cartel's days are now numbered, while a defense
lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned.
   Lehder was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons
of cocaine into the United States. Authorities say the 38-year-old
Colombian was a key figure in the cartel, a violent drug ring
responsible for about 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports.
   The jury reconvened this morning today to decide whether Ledher
should forfeit his millions of dollars worth of real estate on
Norman's Cay and Nassau in the Bahamas to the U.S. government.
   The flamboyant Lehder, described by witnesses as a one-time New
York City street hood, was characterized by U.S. Attorney Robert W.
Merkle, chief prosecutor in the case, as the most important drug
smuggler brought to trial in the United States.
   The verdict capped a seven-month trial on an 11-count federal
indictment charging him with taking over the island of Norman's Cay
in the Bahamas to smuggle cocaine into Florida and Georgia from
1978 to 1980.
   ``In the immortal words of James Brown, `I feel good,''' said a
jubilant Merkle. ``This is truly a major victory in the war on
drugs,'' he added, saying the verdict would put a crimp in the
Medellin Cartel's operations.
   ``I would say they are looking over their shoulders,'' he said.
``I think their days are numbered.''
   However, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House
narcotics committee, said the conviction will by no means solve
this country's drug problem.
   ``Lehder is not the end of the kingpins of the cartel,'' he said.
   Defense attorney Edward R. Shohat, who presented no witnesses on
Lehder's behalf, said, ``We are of the view that Mr. Lehder will be
vindicated on appeal and that he will receive a new trial ... based
only on the charges in the indictment.''
   The trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 government
witnesses, along with mounds of documents. Lehder was extradited to
the United States last year after a firefight and his arrest by the
Colombian army at a Medellin mansion.
   When the verdicts were read, he looked down briefly, then stared
straight ahead. Two female jurors cried, one sobbing into her
hands, as their seven days of deliberations ended. Lehder's aunt in
the audience also cried and slumped on a bench.
   Lehder faces a maximum sentence of life plus 150 years in prison
and $350,000 in fines for his convictions on all 11 counts, ranging
from possession of cocaine to running a continuing criminal
enterprise. Merkle said he will recommend life in prison.
   Lehder's co-defendant, Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro,
Calif., was convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum
15-year sentence.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton scheduled sentencing for
July 20.
   According to Internal Revenue Service figures, the drug kingpin
earned an estimated $250 million in the cocaine business.
   Merkle called Lehder the ``Henry Ford of the cocaine trade,''
the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern, high-tech
operation, using airdrops and speed boats. Prosecutors and
government witnesses described Lehder as an admirer of Adolf Hitler
who put together a vast cocaine-smuggling empire after he was
deported to his homeland.
   In Bogota, Colombia, Attorney General Horacio Serpa Uribe said,
``Everyone in Colombia was hoping for a guilty verdict.'' He
declined further comment.
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III called it ``an excellent
example of international cooperation ... against a major drug
trafficker.''
   Defense lawyer Shohat, who described Lehder as a legitimate
businessman victimized by drug investigators, accused the
government of creating hysteria, convincing jurors their own
security was threatened.
   Lehder ``did not, in my opinion, get a fair trial to which he
was entitled,'' Shohat said.
   Jack Hook, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration,
said the conviction sends a message to other cartel officials that
``you are not able to bribe, intimidate or murder your way out of
custody in the United States.''
   Hook called the cartel the world's largest drug trafficking
ring. By comparison, authorities say the French Connection drug
ring smuggled in about 70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971.
   The principal prosecution witness was Ed Ward, an ex-marine
pilot who ran his own marijuana smuggling operation from Norman's
Cay. He teamed up with Lehder, but eventually fell out with Reed,
he said.
   After his arrest in 1981, Ward began cooperating with the DEA.
He is under federal protection and has been given a new identity.
   Lehder allegedly paid Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the
small island of Norman's Cay, a short hop from Florida.
   Pindling, himself reportedly a target of a Florida grand jury
investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the
allegations a ``fairy tale.''
   The Medellin Cartel has been blamed for a wave of violence
across Colombia, including the assassination of a former justice
minister and the slaying of a top U.S. DEA informant. The trial was
conducted under heavy security.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today
that the United States and the Soviet Union plan to agree at the
Moscow summit on a program of notification of each others'
ballistic missile tests.
   The agreement was to have been a minor part of an overall plan
the superpowers had hoped to reach reducing strategic, or
long-range, nuclear forces by up to 50 percent _ a so-called START
pact.
   Though the two sides have failed to reach that sweeping
agreement, Shultz said, they have developed ``similar language'' on
missile-testing notification _ a program designed to boost
confidence that tests are not a prelude to war.
   ``It's something that conceivably could be lifted out of that
(the START agreement) and signed separately and it would not be a
big deal, but an additional confidence-building measure,'' Shultz
said in a satellite news conference with reporters in Europe and
Canada.
   In addition, President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev are likely to issue a statement outlining other areas of
progress they have made toward the unrealized START agreement,
Shultz said.
   In Moscow, meanwhile, a Soviet spokesman said in an interview
published today that the two sides will include land-based mobile
missiles in their negotiations on a treaty to reduce strategic
nuclear weapons.
   ``We have every reason to believe that the problem of mobile
missiles will be resolved,'' Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, Soviet
Defense Ministry spokesman, told The Washington Post.
   ``We are now coordinating positions on this in Geneva,'' where
U.S.-Soviet arms talks are under way, Chervov said in an interview
in Moscow.
   Chervov said the United States appeared to be moving away from
its demand for a ban on such missiles now that the Pentagon plans
to base MX missiles on railroad cars.
   An American official in Moscow said that there had been no
change in U.S. policy but that the United States has said it is
willing to negotiate on ways to verify an agreement which would
allow both sides to deploy mobile missiles.
   The official was not named. The Reagan administration has
rejected Soviet proposals to include mobile missiles in a START
accord because of verification problems.
   Chervov said U.S. officials have presented ideas in Geneva on
how to verify limits on mobile missiles after earlier seeking a ban
on such weapons when the United States thought its MX missile would
be based in fixed silos and the Soviets were developing mobile
weapons.
   Chervov acknowledged that an agreement on reducing strategic
weapons could not be reached in time for the U.S.-Soviet summit
that begins May 29 in Moscow, as originally had been hoped.
However, he said Moscow would continue to negotiate in hopes of
reaching an accord before President Reagan's term ends.
   ``The problem now is to establish ourselves so we do not go back
from the points we have already reached,'' he said.
   Chervov also said differences over sea-launched cruise missiles
could not be set aside temporarily or solved through unilateral
declarations, as has been formally suggested by U.S. officials. He
said the other major sticking point on a strategic arms reduction
treaty was disagreement over the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative,
also known as Star Wars.

   The county sheriff went into an ailing
prisoner's hospital room, disconnected his oxygen tube and took him
to court even though doctors said he shouldn't be moved, a federal
indictment charges.
   Wyandotte County Sheriff John Quinn was charged with violating a
prisoner's civil rights by interfering with his medical care in an
indictment handed up Thursday. A doctor said the prisoner had to be
put into intensive care after he was returned to the hospital.
   Quinn, who faces up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine if
convicted, said Thursday he had no comment.
   He was accused of disconnecting Damone Lee Cribbs' intravenous
pump and oxygen supply line and taking Cribbs from Bethany Hospital
to a court appearance on July 2, 1986.
   Early that day Cribbs, who had asthma, had complained of
breathing difficulties, and he was taken from jail to Bethany at
about noon.
   At about 3:30 p.m. Cribbs, 19, was taken from the hospital to
the Wyandotte County Courthouse to be sentenced on a misdemeanor
theft charge. He was returned to the hospital about 45 minutes
later.
   By then, Cribbs' condition had worsened and he had to be put in
intensive care, said Dr. John Gamble, physician at the Wyandotte
County Jail. He was hospitalized for several days, Gamble said.
   Cribbs received a year's probation for stealing a wallet from a
woman's purse.

<HEAD>Democratic Chief Blasts Bush as ``Country-Clubber''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 6 grafs with Kirk criticism of Bush, picking
up in 3rd graf pvs, With its; cuts last 4 grafs</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party's national chairman blasted George Bush
today as a do-nothing vice president and a ``quintessential elitist
establishment Republican country-clubber.'' Bush himself sought
black support by meeting with civil rights leaders.
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis and rival
candidate Jesse Jackson were both campaigning in California.
   Today in Atlanta, where the Democrats will have their convention
in July, the chairman of the party's national committee, Paul Kirk,
attacked Bush in a gloves-off speech to the Association of
Democratic State Chairs.
   Kirk said Bush has been ``applauding in the dark shadows of this
Republican administration as it turns thumbs down on public ethics,
thumbs down on the Civil Rights Restoration Act, thumbs down on a
simple 60-days notice to working men and women who are about to
lose their jobs.''
   Bush, the Democratic official said, is ``a quintessential
elitist establishment Republican country-clubber, with no
connection to ethnic America, to minority America, to working-class
America.''
   He said Bush ``has neither the toughness to govern nor the
compassion to care.''
   With its prize of 314 delegates, the California contest on June
7 overshadows the three other primaries the same day _ New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico, which among them offer a total of 152
Democratic delegates.
   Dukakis hopes to clinch the delegates needed to nominate with
that final round of primaries. According to the latest AP delegate
count, Dukakis has 1,645 to Jackson's 974, of the 2,081 needed to
nominate.
   Although Jackson has little chance of overtaking the
Massachusetts governor now, he would like to make California a
staging ground for a final show of strength before the convention.
   At a high school in Bakersfield, Calif., on Thursday, Jackson
spoke of ``the sense of hope, the celebration of people coming
together because we care.''
   Dukakis, arriving in California Thursday night for two days of
campaigning in the state, faced hecklers at his first stop, a rally
in Los Angeles.
   ``We need a president who's not afraid to talk about AIDS,'' the
hecklers shouted. The Massachusetts governor did talk about AIDS,
though, calling it ``a disease that must be conquered.''
   Earlier this month, Dukakis held a stormy meeting with gay
activists in Los Angeles, facing hostile questions about his
opposition to allowing homosexual couples to be foster parents.
   Bush, meanwhile, described his meeting with about 20 civil
rights leaders Thursday night as a ``very good session.''
   But two participants who spoke with reporters afterward
suggested Bush will have to work hard to overcome his association
with the administration's civil rights record.
   ``The Reagan administration record on civil rights is not a
record that anybody can defend,'' said Benjamin Hooks, who heads
the NAACP. ``At this point, I would say the vice president has a
long way to go if he actually expects to get a substantial black
vote.''
   ``I came with a great deal of hope that we'd find in Mr. Bush a
new level of sensitivity to the devastation in the black community
that's escalated and intensified over the past seven years,'' said
Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. ``That hope has not been fulfilled.''
   Nonetheless, Lowery said he hoped to see Bush ``out there
fighting for the black vote.''
   Putting some distance between Bush and President Reagan is
becoming a key part of the vice president's campaign strategy.
   The remaining primaries are something of an afterthought for
Bush, who already has the Republican nomination wrapped up. But a
series of recent polls have suggested that Bush is losing ground
against Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee.
   The vice president acknowledges that controversies over Reagan
administration actions _ such as dealings with Panama's Manuel
Antonio Noriega _ have probably hurt him.
   Noriega is under indictment on drug trafficking charges, but the
administration is said to be ready to drop the charges in order to
get him to step aside.
   Bush has been edging away from Reagan on the Noriega affair,
although he is carefully avoiding any criticism of his boss. The
White House, in turn, is going out of its way to publicly give the
vice president free rein.
   ``As we go through the campaign, I would expect to see the vice
president speaking out on a number of issues,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday. ``I expect a number of
them will be different than existing policies and ... we will not
criticize them ... in any way.''
   The White House reassurance followed Bush's statement this week
that he would not ``bargain with drug dealers.'' Aides said the
message was that as president, Bush would not make a deal with
someone like Noriega.
   The Washington Post, quoting sources, said in today's editions
that Bush, at a high-level meeting, had urged an end to
negotiations with Noriega. Campaign spokesman Peter Teeley said
Thursday night he had no knowledge of Bush's recommendations
concerning Noriega.
   However, Reagan suggested that Bush's comment about not
bargaining with drug dealers had only a limited application.
   ``I think that he was making ... plain that you don't negotiate
with people of that kind with regard to their activity in drugs,''
the president told foreign broadcast journalists in an interview
Thursday.

<HEAD>Art Thieves Steal Three Masterpieces From Dutch Museum</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf, `Stolen were...' to CORRECT date of
Carnations.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thieves smashed a window at the
Municipal Museum today and made off with three 19th-century
paintings worth up to $52 million, including works by Vincent Van
Gogh and Paul Cezanne.
   Museum officials said it was the largest art theft in modern
Dutch history.
   Stolen were ``Carnations,'' an 1888 work by Van Gogh; ``The
House of Maitre Billaud in Nevers,'' by Dutch painter Johan
Jongkind, from 1874; and ``Bottle with Apples,'' an 1894 still life
by Cezanne, the French impressionist.
   Museum director Wim Beeren estimated their combined value at $52
million, but the Christie's auction firm in London set their worth
at $11 million.
   The theft at the downtown museum, also known as the Stedelijk
Museum, was discovered after 5 a.m. when someone broke a window in
the building and triggered an alarm.
   Museum spokesman Maarten Bertheux said no one was inside at the
time. He said the museum's estimated 3,000 works are protected only
by an electronic alarm system when the museum is closed.
   Round-the-clock surveillance by security personnel was abolished
as an economy measure in 1975, Beeren said. ``This is a terrible
loss of prestige for (museum) security,'' he told reporters. The
stolen paintings were not insured.
   The museum, famed for its collection of works by 19th- and
20th-century masters, is a three-story building with large windows
on the street level. The thieves entered through one of those
windows that faces a secluded, tree-shrouded area, officials said.
   They walked through five galleries before reaching the room
where the stolen paintings were on display with two other Van Gogh
works, according to deputy director Rini Dippel.
   Ms. Dippel speculated that the thieves left the other two Van
Gogh paintings, ``The Rocking Chair'' and ``The Diggers,'' because
they were substantially larger than ``Carnations,'' which measures
18.4 by 15 inches.
   There were conflicting accounts on how the theft was discovered.
   Police spokeswoman Heleen van der Weijden police arrived on the
scene after the alarm sounded and entered the museum but failed to
notice the theft. She said the theft was discovered an hour later
by a private security guard.
   Bertheux said museum staffers and police discovered the theft
about 20 minutes after the alarm sounded.
   Recent tests of the alarm system showed it took only three
minutes for police and guards to get there, Beeren said. He could
give no explanation for the delay.
   Mrs. van der Weijden said Interpol and customs services around
the world were alerted.
   The Municipal Museum is next to the Van Gogh Museum, which has
the world's largest collection by the Dutch master. About 200 yards
from the two museums is the Rijksmuseum, the nation's largest
repository of works by Rembrandt.
   According to Christie's, the stolen Van Gogh is worth $1.6
million to $2.1 million; the Cezanne, $7.9 million; and the
Jongkind, $147,000. Ms. Dippel said those estimates were based on
black and white photographs in a museum catalog.
   Beeren said he based his higher estimate on the fact that
``there is a Van Gogh involved, and recent price developments (for
Van Goghs) have been dramatic.''
   In March 1987, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' drew $39.8 million at a
London auction. In November, an unidentified collector paid $53
million for the Dutch painter's ``Irises'' in New York.
   Beeren speculated that the theft may have been commissioned by a
private art collector, since the paintings are too famous to be
sold on the public market.
   ``I've got the impression that they chose the paintings with a
clear purpose in mind,'' he said. ``This'll go straight to
somebody's room or home, I guess.''

   The voice of Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound,
Quick Draw McGraw and dozens of other cartoon characters loved by a
generation of Americans has fallen silent. Charles Dawson Butler is
dead at age 71.
   Daws Butler, as he was professionally known at Hanna-Barbera
Productions, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, the studio announced Thursday. Butler had suffered
a stroke and had been battling pneumonia in the past few months,
the studio said.
   ``I just don't know how the industry will get along without him.
There are a lot of people who can imitate Daws but he was the
original,'' said Janet Waldo, who was the voice of Judy Jetson on
``The Jetsons'' series.
   ``He was one of the most talented artists we've ever been
associated with,'' Hanna-Barbera president Joe Barbera said. ``He
was a little man, but a giant. ... Here's a man that walked into a
studio in 1957 and helped us launch this whole company.''
   Ms. Waldo met Butler on her first cartoon assignment as the
Jetsons' daughter. Butler played her brother, Elroy.
   ``I watched Daws work, and I thought this is impossible that
this one little man can come forward with all these voices,'' she
said of the 5-foot-2 Butler.
   Butler was the voice of 42 cartoon series regular characters,
among them Snagglepuss, Wally Gator, Baba Looey, Augie Doggie, Mr.
Jinks, Lippy the Lion, Snooper and Blabber, as well as hundreds of
other incidental characters.
   Among Butler's well-known lines were Yogi Bear's ``I'm smarter
than the average bear''; Snagglepuss' ``Exit, stage left''; and
Quick Draw McGraw's ``Hold on there! I'm the sheriff around here.''
   Butler also was the voice of Cap'n Crunch for the Quaker Oats
cereal company, and of many characters in Jay Ward's ``Fractured
Fairy Tales'' and ``Aesop and Son.'' Kelloggs used his voice for
Snap, one of the Rice Crispies characters.
   ``He will be terribly missed by everyone at our studio,'' said
Hanna-Barbera co-founder Bill Hanna.
   Mel Blanc, the voice of Warner Bros.' Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig
among others, regarded Butler as ``one of the great voice creators
... an extremely talented individual and very loving,'' said
Blanc's son, Mel Blanc Jr. The elder Blanc was out of town.
   Barbera said there will be a search to replace Butler.
Candidates will practice characters' lines, then give the studio an
interpretation.
   ``If we keep our fingers crossed we may be able to find the
right man. If we don't, we won't (continue the character),''
Barbera said. ``We respect them too much.''
   Butler was born in Toledo, Ohio, and grew up in Oak Park, Ill.
He participated in amateur contests as a young man, doing
impersonations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Rudy Vallee and a Model T
Ford starting up.
   During World War II he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve and was
married. His wife, Myrtis, was from North Carolina, and Butler
maintained that Huckleberry Hound's Southern accent came from
listening to her family and neighbors.
   Butler moved his family to California in 1945, and by 1948 was
starring in ``Time For Beany,'' the West Coast's first TV puppet
show. The show ran for five years. In 1957 he went to work for
Hanna-Barbera.
   Butler is survived by his wife and sons David, Donald, Paul and

   A sculptor says that opponents of a proposed
statue in memory of 20 men and women executed 300 years ago as
witches are just trying to foreget what happened.
   Yiannis Stefanakis is trying to give the city a 14-foot-high
bronze to commemorate the witches, but some residents say greed is
behind the seven-ton sculpture they say will be a tourist
attraction.
   Supporters say the critics want to forget what happened in 1692
and the sculpture is a public apology to the 20 people executed
then.
   ``People like them are the same people who 300 years ago caused
the death of these 20 people. They are still doing it today. It's
an injustice,'' Stefanakis told The Boston Globe in a story
published today.
   Stefanakis, who said he supports himself by making wax molds for
a chocolate company, was inspired to create the statue three years
ago by ``Three Sovereigns for Sarah,'' a film about the Salem
witchcraft trials.
   He said he raised $2,500 in private financing and also got
donations of transportation and a rent-free studio. He said he
hoped to present his work to the city as a gift.
   ``Most people want to forget about what happened in 1692,'' he
said. ``Three hundred years have gone by, and they have done
nothing to commemorate those victims. I decide to step in and make
a statue, and now they form a committee.''
   The Salem Witchcraft Tercentenary Ad Hoc Committee opposes the
statue and is planning an official memorial, said the Rev. John
Szala of the First Salem Church, who heads the committee.
   He said the committee believes planting trees or putting the
names of the 20 victims on plaques with an eternal flame would be
more appropriate.
   And, he said Stefanakis is an outsider who has ignored local
opinion and is ``using a tragic event to make a dollar.''
   ``No one knows how much it cost,'' Szala said. ``To whom does
this man answer? Who receives his financial reports?''
   Stefanakis' publicist, Eleanor Parker, said Stefanakis may make
$40,000 for his three years of work.
   Wayne Higley Jr., a descendant of Rebecca Nurse, one of the
victims depicted in the sculpture, supports the statue.
   ``When the statue is unveiled in October, people will see the
expression of Sarah Cloyce (another victim) looking down at them,''
he said. ``The look on her face says, `Look at what they have done.
Don't let this happen.'

   A fire that began in the chief's office
at police headquarters forced the evacuation of the department and
the city jail, disrupted police communications and injured 10
people.
   The fire Thursday night caused an estimated $1.2 million damage
to the eight-story downtown building, officials said.
   The blaze began in Chief Larry Joiner's fifth-floor office as
workers remodeling the office were spraying lacquer on the walls,
Fire Capt. Joe Galetti said today. The workmen tried to battle the
flames with fire hoses and extinguishers, then called for help.
   The blaze was brought under control in about 90 minutes, Galetti
said.
   About 115 people were evacuated fifteen minutes after the fire
started, including 39 prisoners held in the eighth-floor temporary
holding jail.
   The prisoners were led down nine flights of stairs to the
basement, then transferred to holding cells in the nearby Municipal
Courts building and the Jackson County jail.
   The fire caused disruption in police communications system and
in telephone calls to headquarters. Calls that couldn't be handled
by headquarters were automatically routed to other police and fire
stations.
   Those taken to hospitals included one prisoner, four
firefighters and four police department employees, all treated for
smoke inhalation, and one police employee who had a minor shoulder
injury. Many other people were treated at the scene.

<DATELINE>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tribal chief who witnessed the
arrival of some of the first white settlers a century ago has died
at age 109, it was reported Friday.
   Chief Wavela Mazetese, from the Mwenezi district of Matabeleland
province in western Zimbabwe, died in his village Sunday after a
short illness, the state-owned Chronicle newspaper said.
   Mazetese, in a 1984 newspaper interview, said he was a boy
tending his father's cattle when the first whites he had seen
appeared on horses and in wagons led by oxen.
   Historians said the whites were probably among the first
settlers to arrive in the former British colony of Rhodesia in the
1890s.
   The colony won its independence as a black-governed nation in
1980 following a guerrilla war. It was renamed Zimbabwe, after an
ancient gold-rich African kingdom.
   Mazetese is survived by a wife and 20 children.

<HEAD>Seals Dying of Mysterious Pneumonia Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of seals in Danish waters
are dying of pneumonia, and the mysterious epidemic could spread to
marine mammals in the Baltic Sea, a biologist said Friday.
   More than 200 harp seals are known to have died in recent weeks
on the island of Anholt in Kattegat strait between Denmark and
Sweden, said biologist Paul Mortensen.
   He said the area's entire 1988 generation of seals was lost
because their sick mothers aborted.
   Dying or dead seals also have been found beached on the islands
of Laesoe, Hesseloe and as far south as the port city of
Helsingoer, giving rise to fears that the infection might spead, he
said.
   He said the virus spreads by direct contact between adult seals
as they lie close together on land, adding that it resembles an
influenza that struck hundreds of seals on the Canadian and U.S.
eastern coasts in 1980.
   Another expert, Knud Pedersen of the State Veterinary Serum
Institute, said he suspected a herpes-like virus similar to one
blamed for seal deaths of seals off The Netherlands a few years ago.
   Experts from several government agencies met in Copenhagen to
discuss the crisis. They agreed that more seals will die in the
next few months as the epidemic spreads.
   The harp seal was near extinction in 1975, when it was declared
a protected species. An estimated 5,000 of the mammals inhabit
Danish waters, breeding 500 to 1,000 pups a year.

   Two Kuwaiti men killed when their bomb-laden car
blew up before reaching its intended target were pious Moslems who
were duped by criminals, it was reported Friday.
   The newspaper Al-Qabas also said that fighting terrorism should
include ``immunizing citizens against falling easy prey to
protagonists of crime and deepening sentiments of patriotism with
the youth.''
   The paper warned that more terrrorism should be expected.
   Interior Ministry officials said the two men were planning to
park the car in front of the Kuwait Airways building in downtown
Kuwait on Wednesday, but the explosives apparently went off
prematurely.
   The blast was the third in this northern Persian Gulf country in
less than a month. In December 1983, a car bomb exploded at the
U.S. and French embassies, and in 1985, an attempt was made on the
life of the emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
   Last month, a Kuwait Airways jetliner was hijacked for 16 days
and two Kuwaitis aboard were killed by the gunmen, who have been
described as pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fundamentalists.
   ``We have to shoulder our historic responsibility ... because
confining our attitude to condemation of crimes and counting
casualties will be without avail if we want our country to live in
peace and security,'' Al-Qabas said.
   The two young Kuwaitis, who have been identified as Nasser
Mohammed Ali Hassan Ahmed, 22, and Walid Abdel-Nabi Mohammed Mousa
Al-Mousa, 23, were killed when the car they were traveling in
exploded near the airline's head office.
   Al-Qabas quoted a sister of Ahmed as saying that her family was
surprised to learn about the incident. She described her brother as
``a fervent Moslem who strictly performs his religious obligations
and leads a normal life. We did not discern anything abnormal in
his day-to-day behavior.''
   She said he was a teacher at an elementary school, unmarried and
owned the car that exploded. Her family did not know the companion
killed with him, she said.
   Al-Qabas said Al-Mousa was a geography student at Kuwait
University, and was married with no children.
   The paper quoted Al-Mousa's brother, Adnan, as saying his
brother was ``a very committed Moslem.'' His brother recently
traveled to Turkey and Greece, he said.

   A strong earthquake shook the northern
city of Arica, causing panic but no injuries or damage, authorities
said.
   The quake at 11:20 p.m. EDT Thursday night measured 5.2 on the
Richter scale, said Waverly Person of the National Earthquake
Information Service in Golden, Colo. He said it was centered 125
miles north of Arica in Peru near the Bolivia border.
   Arica is a sea port city on the Pacific ocean 1,240 miles north
of Santiago. It has a population of 120,000.
   Person said the quake was felt across a wide area because it was
centered 75 miles below the earth's surface.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas.

<HEAD>Narita Airport Still Source Of Tension A Decade Later</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONIKA JAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NARITA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after its opening, Narita Airport
is still surrounded by barbed wire and riot police _ bitter
reminders of the often violent war between disaffected farmers and
the government.
   Now an ambitious expansion plan threatens to bring more trouble.
   Since its conception 22 years ago, farmers and demonstrators
have clashed ferociously with riot police over plans to expropriate
vast amounts of fertile farmland and polish it into a gleaming
international gateway.
   Today, the sprawling New Tokyo International Airport, located 40
miles from Tokyo, resembles a beseiged city, patrolled day and
night by 700 policeman.
   Departing passengers and guests are frisked with metal detectors
at several security checkpoints and at times required to produce
identification when entering the airport grounds.
   Six lives have been lost in bloody battles since the 1966
government decision designated Narita as the site for a new
airport. But Koji Kitahara, leader of a group of airport opponents,
claims the figures mean nothing.
   ``More lives will be taken in the fight,'' he vows.
   Together with the Chukaku-ha, Japan's largest radical group,
anti-Narita protesters have sabotaged construction work and even
managed several times to delay the airport inauguration, originally
scheduled for March 1971.
   In one such clash, a handful of leftists crept into Narita's
16th-floor control tower through a sewer tunnel and destroyed its
radar, weather and communications equipment. Outside, about 6,000
demonstrators fought pitched battles with 13,000 policemen.
   The sabotage pushed back the opening for another two months and
it was not until May 20, 1978, that the first flight took off from
the heavily guarded Narita.
   ``For 22 years we have fought the government for disrupting our
lives and taking away our right to a normal livelihood,'' said
Kitahara, 66.
   ``If we allow the completion of the second-phase construction
project, we will have no future,'' he said in an interview at his
home 500 yards from Narita's only runway. Overhead, a jet roared by.
   Kitahara, who has been arrested three times in his fight against
the airport, said many of the displaced farmers have been reduced
to working as day laborers on construction sites. Some wives have
taken up part-time jobs and ``a few of the men even work as guards
at the airport'' to make ends meet, he added.
   ``But many of them come to me now and say they wished they never
sold their land,'' Kitahara said. ``They're no longer their own
boss. They have to take orders from someone else.''
   Government plans call for Narita to be doubled in size by March
1991 with the construction of two runways measuring 8,250 feet and
10,560 feet, and a second terminal building to increase the current
capacity of 11 million passengers annually to 23 million.
   But like the first stage, construction for the expansion has
encountered strong opposition and plans originally targeted for
completion in 1974 have only reached the ground-breaking stage.
   A protest rally has been scheduled for Sunday.
   According to the New Tokyo International Airport Authority,
eight families are thwarting the expansion by refusing to give up
52.6-acres of farmland.
   ``We hope to come to terms with them through talks,'' said
Masataka Takemoto, chief of public relations at the airport
authority office. He said about 325 families have been resettled in
nearby farmlands since 1966 after agreeing to cede their properties.
   Takemoto claims about 200 members of the Marxist Chukaku-ha, or
Middle Core Revolutionary Group, live around the airport and are
threatening to harm the farmers if they sell their land. They
maintain the airport may be used for military purposes.
   ``Even if the farmers want to sell, they can't because of fear
of what the Chukaku-ha will do,'' he said.
   Known for violent tactics and using homemade projectiles and
flamethrowers, the radical group has spearheaded the anti-Narita
movement. It was blamed for forcing the temporary closure of Narita
for one hour in 1985 after firebombs were hurled on the runway.
   ``The group has taken up the matter as just another way of
rebelling against the government,'' said Masahiro Gamo, deputy
chief of public relations of the airport authority. ``As soon as
they find some other anti-government cause to support, they'll
latch onto it.''
   Despite the protests, initial work on the second runway has
begun, tightly cordoned off by coils of barbed wire and guarded
closely by riot police.
   Should the farmers refuse to sell their holdings, Takemoto
added, ``we will take the land through legal means.''
   ``We will finish the airport,'' Takemoto said. ``As a major
power in the world, we have an obligation to complete the
construction.''

   The Senate today overwhelmingly rejected an
attempt by conservative critics of the U.S.-Soviet missile treaty
to link the pact to alleged Soviet cheating on five other
arms-control agreements.
   In a series of five votes, the Senate killed, piece by piece,
the amendment proposed by Steve Symms, R-Idaho.
   Symms' amendment noted that Reagan has told Congress the Soviets
are violating the SALT I and SALT II arms-limitation treaties, a
1963 pact banning open-air atomic tests, a 1925 Geneva protocol
banning chemical weapons and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   His proposal would have required that the administration certify
the Soviets are in compliance with all these pacts before the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty could have taken
effect.
   Conservatives, using Senate rules, insisted on five separate
votes rather than a single roll call. In the tallies, the votes to
kill Symms' proposal were 85-11, 87-10, 86-11, 82-15 and 89-8.
   The decision came after Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas called on his fellow Republicans to speed up the action.
   ``We need to start making real progress on the treaty itself,''
Dole said. ``Time is of the essence; the president leaves next
Wednesday'' for his Moscow summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Dole said Republican senators have ``a special burden'' to
assure that Reagan does not go to Moscow without ratification of
the INF treaty.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, a member of the Senate observer term
which monitored the INF talks, told the Senate, ``As one of them, I
can stand before the Senate and say I have confidence in this
treaty, it need not be changed at all.''
   Symms said his amendments ``simply mean that the treaty does not
go into effect until the president can report the Soviets are in
compliance with existing arms treaties.''
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., opposed the Symms proposal
because he said ``it is designed to kill the INF treaty, not to
produce Soviet compliance.
   Sen. James J. Exon, D-Neb., complaining of Republican stalling,
referred to Symms' proposal as ``nonsense and extraneous.''
   ``I think this is a terrible situation,'' Exon said. ``It would
cripple the president as he represents the United States and the
free world.'' ''
   Exon said Reagan will be partly to blame if the treaty isn't
approved before the summit. ``The president could put his foot
down. He is the president. He is the leader of the Republican Party
without question. I think he is contributing to his own problems.''
   As debate on the amendments opened Thursday, Symms told the
Senate: ``The Soviets cheated in the past and I think we can expect
they're going to cheat in the future.''
   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, noted that the Reagan administration says this
treaty should be considered on its own merits.
   ``To my mind, the important thing is what does this treaty do;
does it help our security or harm it?'' Pell asked. ``I don't think
we ought to be in the position of cutting off our nose to spite our
face.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty ``stands on its own merits. ... It's nonsensical to
tie this to other treaties.''
   The INF treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, calls for
the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of
300 to 3,400 miles.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Reagan ``deserves an
opportunity for this body _ before he goes to Moscow _ to say yes
or no'' to the pact. ``The American people want this treaty
ratified and they want this president to have the opportunity to
maximize what may flow from it.''
   Domenici said he would be surprised if more than 10 of the 100
senators vote against the pact. Ratification requires 67 votes and
Domenici's estimate is similar to forecasts by Senate leaders of
both parties.
   But the opponents could delay the final vote with parliamentary
maneuvers and by introducing numerous amendments.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., leader of the opponents, objected
Thursday when Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., sought approval
to move from consideration of the treaty itself to the separate
resolution of ratification.
   Under Senate rules, designed to protect the rights of the
minority, Helms' objection meant that the chamber couldn't move to
the resolution. Both the treaty and the resolution will be
considered in separate votes.
   Helms said he objected because three other senators, whom he did
not name, planned to offer amendments to the text of the treaty.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., another critic of the pact,
responded to Dole's plea by saying, ``For us to be hurried to suit
the climate of a summit is just a wrong urging at this moment.''

<TEXT>
   Marion G. Romney, president of the Mormon
Church's Council of the Twelve Apostles and one of the faith's
general authorities for 47 years, died today. He was 90.
   Romney died at home of causes incident to age, according to
church spokesman Don Lefevre.
   As the most senior member of the Twelve, Romney was next in line
to become president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. However, because of his advanced age and failing health,
Romney had not been active in church leadership for several years.
   Church President Ezra Taft Benson recently appointed the
next-most-senior apostle, Howard W. Hunter, as acting president of
the Twelve.
   Romney was one of the architects of the church's extensive
welfare system, which was created in 1936. He was called to general
leadership in the church in April 1941 as an assistant to the
Council of the Twelve.
   He was named in October 1951 to the Twelve, which helps the
governing three-member First Presidency, and became a member of the
First Presidency in 1972.
   During his career Romney supervised missionary efforts of the
church in Mexico, Europe, South Africa and Asia. In 1961, he
formally organized in Mexico City the church's first
Spanish-speaking stake, a geographical unit comprised of several
congregations.
   The welfare system he helped develop is based on a philosophy of
self-sufficiency and consists of a network of farms, bakeries and
canneries that provide jobs and goods for church members in need.
Recipients are required to work at one of the welfare enterprises
or perform some other service in return for assistance.
   He shunned public attention and was known for his
self-deprecating wit.
   When responding to his appointment as an apostle in 1951, the
small-statured Romney said: ``This call has set up a tremendous
emotional reaction in me. I didn't think there could be such a big
tempest in such a little teapot.''
   Romney was a counselor to the late church presidents Harold B.
Lee and Spencer W. Kimball between 1972 to 1985. When Kimball died
at age 90 on Nov. 10, 1985, Romney was named president of the
Council of the Twelve by Kimball's successor, Benson.
   Romney, born Sept. 19, 1897, in Colonia Juarez, Mexico, was
forced to flee the country when he was 14 by revolutionaries in
northern Mexico.
   ``We came away with only one trunk holding the belongings of a
family with seven children,'' he later recalled.
   His father had left him in charge of getting the family to
Texas, but as the boy steered the horses and wagon down the road,
members of the rebel army stopped them and took their total savings
of 20 pesos.
   ``Then they turned around, drew their guns, and I looked down
the barrels of rifles that seemed very large to me,'' he said. ``I
expected them to shoot, but for some reason they did not and I have
lived to tell the story.''
   The family lived in El Paso, Los Angeles and Oakley, Idaho,
before settling in Rexburg, Idaho.
   After serving in the U.S. Army, the future church leader
graduated in 1920 from Ricks Normal College in Rexburg. He served
three years as a missionary in Australia before continuing his
education at the University of Utah as an undergraduate and at the
law school.
   Romney is survived by two sons and eight grandchildren. His
wife, Ida Jensen Romney, died March 9, 1979.

   An American Airlines jet bound for
Puerto Rico made an emergency landing in Bermuda last week after a
leak began spewing fuel into the Atlantic Ocean, officials said
today.
   No injuries were reported when the twin-engine jet, a new
wide-body Airbus A300-600R, landed after losing fuel through a
crack in the right engine, American spokesman Steve McGregor said.
   The flight was en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport on Tuesday, May 10, when a pump
casing split, he said.
   The pilot attempted to stop fuel from flowing to the damaged
engine pump, but the shut-off valve was beyond the crack.
   He then released fire-extinguisher bottles inside the engine to
shut it down and diverted to Bermuda, McGregor said.
   The spokesman said he didn't know how much fuel was left on
landing and added that authorities have not yet determined the
cause of the split.

   A judge has released three men
detained without charges for more than four months for alleged
links to a fatal bombing on a house occupied by the African
National Congress, their attorney said Friday.
   High court judge Fergus Blackie ruled May 13 that detention of
the three white farmers from the Matabeleland district of Shangani
was illegal, said attorney Steve Richardson.
   Brothers Harry and John Bawden and Gregory Sloggett were among
18 people detained under the Law and Order Act after the Jan. 11
car bombing of a house near the southern Zimbabwe city of Bulawayo
occupied by the ANC, which is fighting for the overthrow of South
Africa's government.
   The ANC had said two people were killed in the blast, but police
said one person was killed.

   A woman opened fire with a handgun at an
elementary school in this affluent north Chicago suburb today,
wounding as many as eight children, police said.
   Patrolman Gary Schultz said the woman, who appeared to be in her
20s, opened fire at Hubbard Woods Elementary School without
warning. The shooting ended around 11 a.m. and the woman was not in
custody, Schultz said.
   ``We have six kids here that have been shot,'' said spokeswoman
Mary Harris at Evanston Hospital. ``They appear to between 5- and
6-years old. I can't give you a condition report at this time.''
   One youngster was being treated at Highland Park Hospital and
another was expected there, said spokeswoman Sue Masaracchia. The
child at the hospital, who was around 8 years old, was alert, she
said.
   The school is one of three elementary schools in Winnetka. The
kindergarten through fifth-grade schol is located in a residential
neighborhood, said Bobbi Eilers, a Winnetka resident.

   Maple syrup production was up by 225,000
gallons this year, but producers didn't have the banner year they
had been hoping for this spring.
   According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, New England and
New York state produced 805,000 gallons in 1988, with a gallon of
syrup costing an average $34.72 in New England and $25 in New York.
   Vermont again led the nation in production, with 370,000
gallons. New York followed with 310,000 gallons, while New
Hampshire produced 74,000 gallons, Massachusetts produced 44,000
gallons and Maine produced 7,000 gallons.
   In addition, 69,000 gallons of syrup were produced in northern
Maine, on land owned by paper companies near the Canadian border.
   In 1987, the 1987 yield was 580,000 gallons, the worst in 16
years.
   ``The season was a short one, I think _ 28 days,'' said John
Ketcham of the USDA's New England Agricultural Statistics Service.
``A good share of the producers only got one good run, especially
in northern Vermont.''
   If the yield wasn't superior, the quality was.
   ``As far as color this year, it was great, mostly medium to
light and there was a lot of light. It was good quality syrup,''
Ketcham said.
   ``The percentage of the crop that was in the top grades is
high,'' said Everett Willard, maple marketing specialist for the
Vermont Department of Agriculture.
   The sugaring industry was worth $17.188 million in New England
and $7.75 million in New York, up from $11.078 million last year in
New England and up from $5.243 million in New York.

<HEAD>Remains of 14th Century Royal Palace Found In London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have unearthed the 14th century
remains of King Edward II's palace where he relaxed with his
homosexual lover before being deposed by his wife and murdered, as
tradition has it, with a red hot poker.
   The archaeologists have also found on the same London site the
remains of a house owned by Sir John Fastolf, thought to have been
the model for William Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff.
   Falstaff, the hard-drinking, knight-turned-robber, is one of the
great comic creations of English literature.
   The London Museum hailed the find of enormous historical
importance but a member of its archaeological team, Michael
Hammerson, said that under terms of an agreement with a
construction company, the museum must halt its work sometime this
fall. After that, bulldozers will move in to clear the site.
   ``The most important thing now is to record the exact details
before the site is destroyed,'' he said.
   Hammerson said that the developers, St. Martin's Development
Corp., had sponsored the archaeological work.
   The remains of the palace and Fastolf's house were discovered on
a construction site at Hayes Wharf on the south bank of the River
Thames where St. Martin's wants to build offices and apartments.
   A large stone corner of the palace was unearthed last week but
the archaeologists tried to keep the find quiet for fear of
attracting treasure hunters, said the The Times of London which
reported the find Friday.
   The Times said St. Martin's is also wary of publicity because
its development plan is already the subject of an official public
inquiry to decide whether or not it should go ahead.
   The palace was a large moated building covering about 80 square
yards. Known to historians as the ``Rosary,'' it was a retreat on
the far side of the Thames where the king could escape the cares of
office.
   The paper quoted historian Dr. Colin Lucas of Oxford University
as saying this was where Edward enjoyed a reign of dissolution with
his male lover, Piers Gaveston, before being deposed and murdered
at Berkeley Castle in western England in 1327.
   Edward was born in 1284, the son of King Edward I by his Spanish
first wife, Eleanor of Castile. His father trained the prince in
warfare and statecraft but the son acquired habits of extravagance
and frivolity which he retained throughout his life.
   Edward I attributed his son's attitude to the influence of his
French friend Gaveston, a Gascogny knight, and drove the Frenchman
into exile. But when Edward I died in 1307, his son's first act on
becoming king was to bring back to England the man he called his
``brother Piers.''
   Gaveston acted as regent in control of the realm when Edward
went to France to marry Isabella, daughter of the French king
Philip IV, in 1308. She was to bear the king two sons and two
daughters.
   Edward's barons grew indignant over Gaveston's influence and
twice insisted on his banishment. But on each occasion, Edward soon
recalled his friend.
   The barons finally went to war against the king and Gaveston,
killing Gaveston and forcing Edward to stand aside while a baronial
committee took over the government.
   In 1327, Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer deposed Edward.
He was imprisoned and one of his sons was chosen as king.
   Tradition has it Edward was murdered with a red hot poker.
   The palace is mentioned in the 19th century antiquarian study,
``A History of the King's Works,'' and an illustration of the site
appears in a map by the 16th century cartographer Ralph Agas.
   Shakespeare is believed to have modeled Falstaff, a rambunctious
lover of life who appears in both the ``King Henry IV'' plays and
``The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' on Fastolf.
   But The Times said the discovery near the house of jetties and
inlets suggested Fastolf in fact was not much like the character
the Elizabethan playwright created.
   ``There are far more docking installations than we had
suspected. The evidence suggests that he was an important
merchant'' and therefore not a knight, Hammerson said.
   The Times said Fastolf built the house in 1446.
   It said the finds at the site of the house were known to include
large amounts of leatherwork, pewter ware and a tall felt hat.

<HEAD>Kasparov Ahead In Dutch Tournament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet world chess champion Gary
Kasparov has taken the lead in a four-player spectacular that pits
him against arch-rival Anatoly Karpov in their first meeting since
the championship last year.
   Halfway through the tournament, Kasparov topped the standings
Thursday with four points for an unbeaten performance of two wins
and four draws from the six rounds played so far in the event.
   Karpov, also from the Soviet Union, was running a close second,
lagging half a point behind the champion.
   Kasparov beat Karpov in 1985 to become world champion and
retained his title last year in Seville, Spain.
   In their first match since Seville, the two drew. In the second
match, Kasparov came out on top in a fantastic win.
   That game, in which Kasparov played white against his arch
enemy's pet Caro-Kann defense, was one of the wildest and most
exciting in recent tournament play at the grandmaster level,
according to visiting British grandmaster Tony Miles.
   After the ``great K's'', as they have become known, drew their
first encounter since last year's world title match in Seville,
Spain, experts were predicting the same result in Wednesday's match.
   But Kasparov sprung a surprise on Karpov and on the all-knowing
experts.
   After just 16 moves, he sacrificed a knight and followed up with
an all-out attack on the black King's side that grandmaster Miles
said was ``a perfect example of pure fighting chess.''
   Experts in the press room were at a loss to explain Kasparov's
daring play and the one-hundred strong audience in the tournament
hall were standing on their seats to miss nothing of the
hair-raising duel.
   Karpov initially weathered the onslaught, capturing a second
piece and countering with a mating threat of his own.
   But problems arose as he ran into time trouble.
   On the 25th move, he missed a chance to win in one move. On the
39th, he exceeded the time limit where he was one move short of the
control in a position that the experts afterwards said was probably
a draw.
   Against Holland's John van der Wiel in Thursday's sixth round,
Karpov was his old self again, coolly making the most of his slim
advantage in a Queen's Indian, gradually increasing the pressure
against black's weakened center and clinching victory on the 39th
move.
   Kasparov's encounter with Dutchman Jan Timman, ranked third on
the world rating list, was more of an anticlimax.
   The world champion, playing white, refrained from taking the
initiative against his theoretically weaker opponent.
   Visiting grandmaster Miles hypothesized that Kasparov was still
``somewhat dizzy'' from his victory over Karpov.
   Early on, Timman had some trouble in stopping white's attack,
but eventually evened out around his 40th to sign the peace five
moves later.
   The tournament, with a World Chess Federation category 17 and an
average rating of 2,674 points _ the strongest ever held _ will
continue Sunday with Kasparov facing Van der Wiel and Karpov
playing Timman in seventh-round action.
   After six rounds, Kasparov had 4 points; Karpov 3{; Timman 3;
and Van der Wiel 1{.

<HEAD>Kim Proposes Political Talks With North Korea On Olympics</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Korea, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on
Friday proposed that South Korea and North Korea hold talks on
being co-hosts for the Olympic Games opening in Seoul in September.
   Kim, head of the largest opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, made the proposal at a meeting of 71 party members who
were recently elected to the National Assembly.
   ``If possible, we need to explore ways to co-host the Olympics
through talks between political parties of the two sides,'' he said.
   Kim, 62, said he believes North Korea is less enthusiastic about
taking part in the Olympics but South Korea should persuade them to
attend.
   The opposition leader said he would inform the government of his
idea when he visits the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee on
Saturday.
   Kim said if the issue of being co-hosts is solved, South Korea
would benefit by ensuring the security of the Olympics and forcing
North Korea to open its closed society, thereby promoting chances
of national unification.
   Roh's governing Democratic Justice Party denoucned Kim's
statement as ``a irresponsible political maneuvering'' that may
compound the Olympic and other inter-Korea issues.
   Democratic Justice Party spokesman Kim Jung-wee said although
all South Korean people are free to debate the Olympics matter, it
is necessary that the government should serve as a ``unified''
channel of dialogue with North Korea.
   The nation's two other opposition groups, Kim Young-sam's
Reunification Democratic Party and Kim Jong-pil's New Democratic
Republican Party, reacted with skepticism to Kim Dae-jung's
proposal.
   Reunification Democratic Party spokesman Suh Chung-won quoted
his party leader, Kim Young-sam, as saying, ``The proposal is
impossible to be be put into practice.''
   New Democratic spokesman Cho Yong-jik said, ``All
unification-related debate should be open, but it is desirable that
dialogue with North Korea should be conducted through concerned
government authorities.''
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics in Seoul
unless it is made a co-host. Despite its threat to organize a
Communist-bloc boycott, a record 161 nations, including the Soviet
Union and China, have said they would send athletes to Seoul.
   The International Olympic Committee said any idea of having both
nations serve as hosts would be a violation of the Olympic charter.

<HEAD>Police Disperse Anti-U.S. March; Aquino Urged to Take Stand on
Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police wielding riot sticks dispersed
about 300 demonstrators Friday who marched near the U.S. Embassy
and demanded removal of American military bases in the Philippines.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel urged President Corazon Aquino to
notify the United States immediately if she doesn't plan to extend
the lease on the six bases.
   A crowd of anti-nuclear activists chanting anti-American slogans
marched to within 20 yards of the U.S. Embassy. Police moved in
after the protesters refused to stop the march.
   Reporters said some demonstrators sat on the ground and were
dragged away by police. At least 11 demonstrators were taken to a
nearby precinct, but police said they didn't make any arrests.
   Laurel told a civic group that Mrs. Aquino should take a public
position on the issue, the subject of talks between the United
States and the Philippines.
   The president has pledged to allow the bases to remain here
until their lease expires in 1991, but she has refused to say
whether she would agree to an extension.
   ``You cannot keep your options open until 1991, because one year
before 1991 you must already give notice of your intention to
terminate,'' Laurel said.
   In related development, Sen. Rene Saguisag filed a bill Friday
banning the use of ``futuristic'' weapons in the country. The
proposal supplements earlier congressional bills outlawing the use
of any part of the Philippines for storage of nuclear weapons.
   ``It is hereby declared illegal for any part of the Philippine
territory to be used for assembly, storage, deployment, transit, or
any other use of any futuristic weapons like laser beams, laser
rays and particle beam generators,'' the bill said.
   The bill would make it illegal for a person to bring into the
country even components of such weapons. Violators could face 10
years to life in prison.
   The bill proposes that foreigners found to have violated the ban
be deported after serving the full prison sentence.

   Funerals for 14 young people who died in a
fiery bus crash were being held today after a huge memorial service
for all 27 victims, at which a minister told tearful mourners,
``Don't blame God.''
   A mass funeral is scheduled tonight for seven of the victims at
the First Assembly of God Church, which owned the bus. Separate
funerals for the other four were being held today and tonight.
   Three victims of the disaster were eulogized this morning in
funeral services in two Kentucky towns and in Florida.
   ``It just got terribly emotional at the Our Father. I just got
all choked up. It was a moment when the whole church just let go
together,'' said the Rev. Jim Graf, pastor of St. Monica Catholic
Church in Bardstown, where a funeral Mass was said for Sandy
Brewer, 12.
   In his homily, Graf likened the child's death to Paul's final
departure from his beloved church at Ephesus, where ``in tears (the
Ephesians) gave him up because they would not see him again.''
   An estimated 6,000 people, including Gov. Wallace Wilkinson,
packed North Hardin High School's football stadium for the memorial
service in this town near Fort Knox Thursday night. The stadium is
next to the cemetery where many of the victims are being buried.
   ``Why do bad things happen to good people?,'' asked the Rev.
Gene Waggoner, whose Baptist church lost two members in the crash.
``None of us can answer that question. And if we could, it wouldn't
take away your grief.''
   ``I suggest that you do not blame anybody on that bus. I suggest
that you don't blame God; God did not cause this,'' he added.
``There is sin in this world ... and there are those who make wrong
choices, and innocent people pay the price.''
   Twenty-four children and three adults were killed Saturday night
when a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 struck
the bus, rupturing its fuel tank and setting it ablaze. The truck's
driver allegedly was drunk and has been charged with 27 counts of
murder.
   The crash occurred 100 miles northeast of this Army post town,
as the bus carried members of First Assembly's youth group and
guests home from a day at an amusement park north of Cincinnati.
   At the stadium Thursday, many people broke down during the
singing of ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus'' at the start of the
service. Many clasped hands and supported others during prayers.
   Bleachers in the stadium can hold 2,400 people, and chairs were
set up on the field to boost capacity to about 4,000. Rows of
people crowded around the perimeters of the field.
   W. Don Tennison, pastor of the First Assembly of God Church,
read letters from President and Nancy Reagan and Vice President and
Barbara Bush.
   ``Your pain and loss is ours too,'' said the Reagans' letter.
``Your countrymen are with you in prayer.''
   The mass funeral here tonight was for Dwailla Fischel, 12;
Richard Keith Gohn, 19; Anthony Marks, 15; Phillip Lee Morgan, 13;
William J. Nichols Jr., 17; Emillie S. Thompson, 13; and Crystal
Erin Uhey, 13.
   Miss Fischel was to be buried in Denver. The other six were to
be buried inNorth Hardin Memorial Gardens cemetery, which is next
to the stadium.
   Funerals were conducted this morning for Cynthia Anne Atherton,
13, in Central City; April Mills, 15, in Fernandina Beach, Fla.;
and Miss Brewer, who is to be buried in Stuttgart, West Germany.
   A memorial service was scheduled at a Fort Knox chapel for Lori
Kathleen Holzer, 11, whose body was cremated.
   Seven victims were buried Thursday. The remaining funerals are
scheduled Saturday and Monday.
   The driver of the pickup, Larry W. Mahoney, was in the prison
unit of Humana Hospital-University of Louisville. A hospital
spokeswoman said Mahoney's family refused to allow release of
information about his condition.
   Two more school bus accidents were reported elsewhere Thursday.
In Harrisburg, Pa., a bus overturned on a curve and plunged down an
embankment, injuring 60 people returning from a church outing, and
in Albion, Iowa, more than 20 fifth-graders were hurt in a crash,
authorities said.
   No one was killed in either accident. Officials said most of the
injuries apparently were bruises, cuts and broken bones.

   The pop of a burning piano's strings was
sweet music to its owner, who credits the noise with awakening him
in time to escape a fire that destroyed his home.
   ``I was awakened by a ping, ping, ping,'' said Bennie Conner,
41. ``It sounded like someone playing it, but it was a high, shrill
sound.''
   Thursday's fire, apparently sparked by a faulty electrical
heater in the basement, quickly enveloped the two-story wood house
in this western North Carolina town, fire officials said.
   Conner's wife and a son had already left for work and school
when the fire spread and the sound of the piano woke Conner. Flames
caused the piano's strings to snap, creating the ``pinging'' sound.
   Conner said he opened his eyes to see smoke curling under the
door of the bedroom. He grabbed his clothes and made his way
through thick, black smoke to the front door, he said.
   Conner said he and his wife bought the piano for their younger
son to practice on. An older son no longer lives at home.
   ``I'm just thankful we had the piano,'' Conner said. ``I'm not
sure I would have awoke if it hadn't been for it.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Team Tracks Down the Uncommitted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Away from the balloons and the lights of
politics, a lawyer and a onetime bricklayer run a computer-driven
operation pulling in the delegates Michael Dukakis needs to win the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   Until recently, they have worked in obscurity, but as Dukakis
has gotten closer to his goal they've been getting more recognition.
   ``My profile has gotten raised so much in the last week it's
frightening,'' said Tad Devine, the 32-year-old lawyer who oversees
delegate selection for the Dukakis campaign.
   While the candidate was on Capitol Hill meeting with
congressional leaders during a recent trip to Washington, Devine
was across town having quiet discussions with labor union officials.
   ``Just kind of floating around'' is how he describes his
activities that day. The previous day, he said, he, too, had been
up at the Capitol ``and had floated around a little.''
   Susan Brophy, the deputy director of delegate selection, was
back at campaign headquarters in Boston, minding the store.
   More than 85 percent of the 1,645 delegates Dukakis has gained
so far have been won in primaries and caucuses. But the rest,
including party leaders, politicians, the uncommitted and delegates
originally supporting other candidates, have been won one at a time.
   Winning them has risen in importance as Dukakis strives to nail
down the total needed for nomination _ 2,081 _ by the end of the
primaries on June 7.
   Devine and Ms. Brophy run a 15-member staff whose mission is to
soft-sell delegates on the idea of voting for the Massachusetts
governor at the Democratic National Convention, although ``sell''
is a work neither of them likes to use.
   ``I hate to think of a person running for president of the
United States as a product,'' Devine says.
   The job is about 70 percent science and 30 percent art, Devine
says.
   Computers keep track of how many times a delegate has been
contacted and by whom, along with political and biographical
information.
   ``It goes through various stages,'' Ms. Brophy says. ``At the
initial stage it's just sort of introductory. Then it goes more to
the persuasion stage and then to the conversion stage.''
   The marching orders: Be persistent, be helpful but don't be
pushy.
   ``The train-leaving-the-station and other similar approaches are
not effective,'' Devine says. ``It causes resentment.''
   On occasion, the staff lines up calls for Dukakis himself to
make to close the deal.
   ``He's very good on the phone,'' Ms. Brophy says. ``He's very
persuasive on the phone.''
   The operation runs from around 9 a.m. to nearly midnight, and
someone is working every day, she says. The pace will pick up in
June, when many states that started their processes months ago
finally get around to picking their delegates.
   Devine gained experience in delegate tracking for Walter Mondale
in 1984 and before that for Jimmy Carter. Dukakis was one of three
presidential candidates who wanted to hire him for 1988, Devine
says. He won't name the other two.
   He and Dukakis met one night as the candidate was being driven
around New Hampshire, attending house parties for his long-shot
campaign.
   The impression was strong enough that Devine, whose wife was
pregnant at the time, quit his job at the Washington law firm of
Winston and Strawn, took a nearly 50 percent pay cut and moved to
Boston to work for Dukakis.
   Ms. Brophy had known Dukakis for 14 years, having worked on his
first gubernatorial campaign and later having been his student at
the John F. Kennedy School of Public Affairs at Harvard.
   In the meantime, she has been policy director for the Democratic
National Committee, has run a program to help women get jobs in the
construction industry and has been a communications director for
the bricklayers union.
   She also learned how to lay bricks and says she can swing a
hammer with skill.
   The caution of a lawyer and the methodical approach of a
bricklayer have met with success.
   For example, Mary Sue Gutierrez, a Democratic national
committeewoman from New Mexico, says she gets about two calls a
week from the Dukakis campaign, and while she's still uncommitted,
she's leaning toward the Massachusetts governor.
   But for some phone-weary delegates the sale may be tough.
   Keron Kerr of Maine has an answering machine on her telephone
that says, ``Hello, this is Keron Kerr. My delegate status is still
uncommitted.''

<HEAD>Money Crunch Causes Pentagon to Cut Buying, Hiring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government accounting practices and the
deficit-reduction drive prompted the Pentagon on Friday to stop
buying office supplies, ban overtime and limit civilian hiring for
at least the next six weeks.
   All new contracts for research and development work also have
been put on hold temporarily, as have purchases of everything from
magazine and newspaper subcriptions to television sets, library
materials, recreation equipment, lawn mowers and furniture.
   Tools, paint, lumber, air conditioners and forklifts also are on
the prohibited list for the time being, as are plans to lease cars,
office space or computer equipment.
   The new restrictions, ordered by Deputy Defense Secretary
William H. Taft IV, will remain in place at least through June 30.
   They were prompted by the terms of a deficit-reduction
compromise reached by President Reagan and Congress last November.
That compromise was crafted to control government outlays _ the
amount of money actually spent during a fiscal year.
   Within the Defense Department, however, the number that counts
is one known as budget authority _ the amount of money that can be
obligated, regardless of when it is going to be spent.
   For example, if Congress authorizes $100 million for the Navy to
buy a new ship, the Navy has $100 million in multi-year budget
authority but might pay out only $10 million for work performed the
first year.
   All that makes it difficult for the Pentagon to project
precisely how much it will pay out in a fiscal year; a contractor
might get more or less work done than originally expected.
   Taft said the Pentagon now has to worry as well about the fiscal
1988 outlay estimate contained in the deficit-reduction agreement _
$277.3 billion.
   ``One dollar of obligations almost always results in one dollar
of outlays,'' he told reporters.
   ``Whether it results in a dollar of outlays on Sept. 28 (fiscal
1988) as opposed to Oct. 2 (fiscal 1989) certainly shouldn't be a
large management concern. And yet, because of the focus on the
deficit, which is toted against outlays, this is our problem ....''
   Based on spending reports received in March and April, the
Defense Department is paying out dollars at a rate that by the end
of the year on Sept. 30 would put outlays some $2.5 billion above
the $277.3 billion total, Taft said.
   While the outlay totals for those two months might be ``an
aberration'' and spending will even out in future months, the
Pentagon can't take any chances, Taft said, ``so we are trying to
get at discretionary spending that can be deferred for six weeks
....''
   The spending hold will probably slow only about $500 million in
outlays, Taft said, but that will start attacking the problem while
figures for May are compiled and officials see just how serious a
problem they have.
   One wild card in the projections involves the value of the
dollar against foreign currencies, Taft said. Up to $1 billion of
that $2.5 billion in faster-than-expected outlays was needed to
shore up allowances for soldiers overseas, he said.

<HEAD>Network Seeking To Stop State From Enforcing Ban on Exit Polls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC is seeking an injunction against the
state of Montana to keep it from enforcing its prohibition on exit
polls, used by the media to forecast the winners of elections.
   Montana law forbids anyone to question voters about their
choices within 200 feet of a polling place. Violations are
misdemeanors punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of
$500.
   NBC maintains the law violates its First Amendment rights of
free speech and commentary on the electoral process. The ban
interferes with the gathering and reporting of truthful and
significant information about the political process on election
day, the network argued in federal court papers.
   ``Carried to its logical extreme, two neighbors coming out of a
polling place after voting could not ask how the other voted,''
said Billings attorney Sid Thomas, who is representing NBC. ``Those
who seek accurate, legitimate information cannot do so.''
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday, asks for preliminary and permanent
injunctions to stop the state from enforcing the 200-foot
prohibition.
   Defendants in the suit are Attorney General Mike Greely and
Commissioner of Political Practices Dolores Colburg.
   Both Colburg and Greely were out of their offices today and
unavailable for comment.
   The 1985 law was an outgrowth of the 1980 presidential election,
when the major TV networks declared Ronald Reagan the winner before
polls had closed in the Mountain and Pacific time zones. The
restriction was sought so that voters in the West would not be
discouraged from voting because the election was already declared
over by the media.

   A stockyard worker has been arrested on a
federal warrant for allegedly making a death threat against
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson.
   Leland Duane Bowden, 33, was arrested last Saturday and was able
to post bond Monday after appearing before a U.S. Magistrate,
authorities said.
   La Junta police detective John Spencer said his agency made the
arrest in cooperation with the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service.
   Bowden could not immediately be reached, but La Junta Livestock
bookkeeper Mary Marincich said he was back at work Thursday.
   Noone answered the telephone today at the Secret Service office
in Denver, which is handling the case.
   A Denver law enforcement source involved with the case told The
Rocky Mountain News the charges against Bowden involved using a
fictitious identification to cash a government check, violation of
tax laws and making threats against a presidential candidate,
identified as Jackson.

   King Birendra dissolved the National
Sports Council after a government report blamed the group for
failing to control a stadium stampede in which more than 70 people
died, the royal palace said Friday.
   The action backed the request from Prime Minister Marich Man

negligent in its ownership, control and protection of the stadium
and for failing to keep the stadium gates in proper condition.
   On March 12, panic broke out in the crowd watching a soccer
match when a hailstorm began suddenly. Fans rushed toward the exit
gates _ which were all locked except for one exit _ and more than
70 people were killed and 100 injured in the stampede.
   The government earlier dissolved the All-Nepal Football
Association, which organized the match, saying it failed to handle
the incident properly.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen-year-old Niveen
Dahman does the housework for her family now that her mother is in
jail. She cooks and cleans, and when clashes with Israeli soldiers
erupt, she runs to the streets to help youngsters choking on tear
gas.
   ``I am doing the same as my mother. It's my duty,'' said Niveen,
sitting in her family's cement block house in the Shati refugee
camp. In the next room was a box full of chickens that the family
is raising to eat as the Arab uprising persists, bringing with it
worsening economic conditions.
   A new role for Moslem children and women, both held under strict
rule in the traditional religious society, is one of the changes
spawned by the nearly six-month rebellion against Israel's
occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   According to U.N. figures through April, a quarter of the 4,344
Palestinians in Gaza injured in the revolt were under 16.
   Israeli authorities complain that their soldiers are
increasingly facing women and children rioters.
   ``Now we are the leaders,'' said 19-year-old Rafat, sitting on
the floor of another cement block house down the street from Niveen
Dahman's home.
   ``Youth are leading, burning tires, stoning soldiers,'' said
Rafat, who would not give his last name. ``Women try to help the
boys who are arrested or try to stop arrests. They go to the kids
when soldiers throw tear gas.''
   Niveen Dahman's mother, Widad, was arrested this month as an
``inciter'' along with two other women in Shati. They were the
first women to be jailed in the Gaza Strip under administrative
detention laws, where no trials or specific charges are required.
Each was given six months in prison.
   Palestinian activitist Mary Khas says the arrests showed that
Israel has recognized the new power of women in the uprising.
Women, allowed out during curfew, became messengers and lookouts,
she said.
   ``Women found their authority and strength and started
organizing,'' said Ms. Khas, who runs a kindergarten program
throughout the Gaza Strip.
   As for Palestinian youth, Ms. Khas said, ``They did what
youngsters do _ try to change things. It was a spontaneous mass
revolt.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and fundamentalist Moslem
groups are behind the rebellion, but Ms. Khas said it was the
young, ``the grassroots leadership,'' that kept the uprising going.
   She pointed out that Israel had arrested many traditional
leaders active in PLO-organized committees of lawyers, doctors and
other professionals, but still the revolt persists.
   ``They're all the time arresting what they call the leadership,
but they haven't gotten the leaders,'' she said.
   Riad Al Agha, a former president of Gaza Islamic University,
said the stifling life of the refugee camps has spawned young
leaders who do not have their parents' fear of Israeli soldiers.
   ``The uprising right now is led by youth age 15 to 25. Most live
in the refugee camps around the strip and the West Bank,'' he said.
``They will never listen to the older generation.''
   Agha described the revolt this way: ``Most of the men go to work
in Israel and leave their sons at home to throw stones.'' He said
sons sometimes stop fathers from going to work, but not forever.
   Agha, who has a Ph.D. from the University of Kansas, said many
of the youth in Gaza have taken up the hard-line ideas of the
Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, a radical fundamentalist group that
wants an Islamic state including all of what is now Israel.
   He said if the revolt persists with no Israeli concessions,
youth will emerge as political leaders and replace so-called
moderates who would be satisfied with a Palestinian state alongside
Israel.
   The young men on the streets think they are winning, since they
have faced Israel's might with only rocks and painted slogans.
   One day last week, a group of boys and young men set a tire
ablaze at the entrance to Gaza City. They were waiting by the road
with stones in hand.
   Hamad, who said he was 15 but looked years younger, said they
wanted revenge for Arabs beaten earlier, and they hoped Israeli
soldiers would come by. They also were targeting cars taking
workers to Israel, he said.
   ``I don't go to Israel,'' Hamad said. ``My work is here _
throwing stones.''

<HEAD>Cash for Food Said `Last Resort' to Aid Starving Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's plan to give cash
to the Contra rebels inside Nicaragua is ``a last resort'' aimed at
feeding the starving remnants of the guerrilla force, the head of
the U.S. foreign aid program said Friday.
   ``There are people inside Nicaragua who are desperate ... we've
had reports of people eating tree roots,'' Alan Woods,
administrator of the Agency for International Development, told a
Senate subcommittee.
   Woods said AID plans to send cash at the rate of $1 per day per
rebel, but is still working out the details.
   A March 23 agreement between the Contras and Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government permits humanitarian aid to be sent to the
rebels while the two sides hold peace talks.
   But a dispute over how the aid should be delivered has meant no
help has yet been sent, and the State Department came up with the
cash plan as a substitute, Woods said.
   ``We have taken this particular step as a last resort,'' he
said, to keep the Contras inside Nicaragua while the peace talks
are proceeding and thus keep the pressure on the Sandinistas.
   Up to 3,000 rebels have reportedly fled across the Nicaraguan
border into Honduras to search for food in recent weeks.
   ``We are seeing resistance fighters coming out of Nicaragua at a
high rate,'' Woods said.
   Details of the cash plan are still being worked out, Woods said,
but that at the rate of $1 per rebel per day for a 30-day period,
the program will cost an estimated $450,000.
   The money, in the Nicaraguan currency of cordobas, will sent by
courier, he said.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Western Hemisphere subcomittee, was skeptical about the
proposal.
   ``This is a pretty weak accounting system,'' Dodd said, adding
that the plans ``raise serious questions about compliance with
existing legislative restrictions.''
   Congress specifically banned spending any of the aid money for
weapons, and Woods said that will be difficult to do because
cordobas are not generally accepted outside Nicaragua.
   He said ``we are concerned'' about accounting for the money, but
he told Dodd on several occasions, ``We're doing the best we can
under the circumstances.''
   Woods won praise from two Republicans on the subcommittee, Sens.
Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota and Paul Trible of Virginia.
   Boschwitz said, ``It really is a difficult situation'' while
Trible said, ``It's very easy to criticize, but you're operating
under very difficult circumstances.''
   The direct shipments of food have not begun because the two
sides cannot agree on a neutral organization, a requirement spelled
out by Congress in March when it voted $48 million in humanitarian
aid.
   Woods said the International Red Cross has been rejected by the
Contras as a delivery agency, but he didn't know why.
   ``The simple bottom line ... is that if they'd reach agreement,
we'd start delivering food,'' he said.
   AID will use any agency the two sides approve, even the Soviet
airline Aeroflot, Woods told the subcommiteee. ``Any mechanism the
two sides approve is better than what we're doing,'' he said.
   The Contras and the Sandinistas signed a temporary truce in
Sapoa, Nicaragua, on March 23. They agreed to try to negotiate a
permanent cease-fire during a 60-day period starting April 1.
   With the deadline for reaching agreement on formally ending
their six-year war just two weeks away, there has been virtually no
progress toward that objective.

<HEAD>Kentucky Land Bank To Receive $90 Million Under New Farm Credit
Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About $90 million in federal aid has been
approved for the Federal Land Bank of Louisville, Ky., the Farm
Credit System Assistance Board announced Friday.
   Eric P. Thor, the board's chief executive officer, said the
Louisville bank will receive assistance through the sale of up to
$90 million in preferred stock to the Financial Assistance Corp.,
which will raise funds for that investment by selling 15-year bonds.
   The board and corporation were created by last year's
Agricultural Credit Act to help bail out the financially distressed
Farm Credit System, a network of cooperatively owned farm banks and
associations.
   Thor said the Louisville bank, which serves borrowers in Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, applied to the board for financial
help in February. He said the board and the bank have ``reached
agreement on a number of steps which will continue to strengthen''
the institution's financial management.
   Although the Louisville bank had presented ``a well-thought-out,
workable plan for financial recovery,'' its stock had dropped to 65
percent of par value and was unable to implement the plan without
federal help, he said.
   ``The bank has made substantial progress in resolving its own
financial problems over the past two years,'' Thor said.
   Programs included an asset-liability management program in 1986
to control interest rate risks and reduce costs, and a market-based
loan pricing system in 1987 to provide competitive rates to
borrowers. Also, he said, the bank ``reduced its non-performing
loans and inventory of acquired property by 30 percent, and
projects a similar reduction this year.''
   Jeanne Kling, a spokewoman for the board, said the $90 million
for the Louisville bank was ``the first full-blown'' assistance
designated under the new law.
   Earlier this year, the board approved $25 million in ``limited
purpose'' assistance in short-term funding to help the Federal Land
Bank of Jackson, Miss., stay in business. And $20.5 million was
provided to retire stock in six financially troubled production
credit associations in the Omaha, Neb., and Spokane, Wash.,
districts.
   ``But this is the first one that we've done under the general
context of helping the bank'' in general, Ms. Kling said.

   A man who allegedly swindled nine former
wives was arrested after people who saw an episode of NBC's
``Unsolved Mysteries'' called the FBI and said they knew a man who
looked like him.
   FBI agents on Thursday arrested Louis Carlucci, a chef wanted by
New York police on grand larceny charges. He went by the name Louis
Serra in Tennessee.
   Carlucci, 44, was the subject of a segment on the television
show, which features dramatizations of wanted criminals.
   Authorities say Carlucci has been married nine times and has
more than 30 children. According to New York police, he is believed
to have fleeced his wives of at least $1 million by running their
credit card accounts to the limit, draining their savings and
encouraging them to invest in jewelry, restaurants and cars.
   U.S. Magistrate Kent Sandidge ordered Carlucci jailed Thursday,
pending extradition to New York.
   Carlucci said from jail that he was host of a birthday party
Wednesday night and did not see the show.
   ``I saw the show last week, but it never dawned on me they'd run
a show about me,'' he said. ``I'm glad it's over. It's no fun being
on the run. I'm not saying I'm an angel, but I'm not a murderer,
either.''
   Carlucci lived less than a block from a police station in
Nashville.

   Victory by the Boston Celtics over the hometown
Hawks in the National Basketball Association playoffs would be a
relief to one group in Atlanta _ the planners of the 1988
Democratic National Convention.
   The longer Atlanta prevails in post-season play, the longer the
Democrats must wait to move into the Omni, where they will convene
July 18-21 to choose their presidential nominee.
   After losing the first two games of the NBA Eastern Conference
semifinal series, Atlanta captured the next three in a row, the
latest a 112-104 victory in Boston Wednesday night.
   ``The Celtics let us down last night,'' Sky Johnson, convention
hall manager for the Democratic National Convention Committee, told
broadcasters Thursday.
   If Atlanta survives to the final round of the NBA championship,
the party can't claim the hall until late June, which would mean
around-the clock construction shifts to prepare the Omni in time,
Johnson said.
   ``If we lost that whole month, we'd have to compensate
somehow,'' he added.

<HEAD>High School Senior Taps Out Winning Essay In Morse Code</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took Kimberly Estes eight painstaking
hours to tap out the essay that won her first place and $2,000 in a
contest.
   Miss Estes, who suffers from cerebral palsy, wrote her essay in
Morse code.
   She can't walk, talk or move her arms well. But the 18-year-old
high school senior earned a 4.0 average at McGavock High School and
was the top French student at Apollo Middle School.
   Miss Estes plans to attend David Lipscomb College this fall,
where she may major in biochemistry.
   She communicates with Morse code, using a computer system her
father and a friend devised. At home, she communicates by gesturing
and nodding her head.
   ``She loves to write, and she has a lot to say,'' her father,
Wayne Estes, said. ``Even now, she says a great deal with her eyes.
She is very expressive.''
   Miss Estes was stricken at birth with cerebral palsy, a disorder
of the central nervous system that results from brain damage. It is
characterized by paralysis and difficulty with motor movement.
   She tries to control her tremors and spasms by concentrating on
relaxing, using an electrode to measure her heart rate.
   The theme of Miss Estes' essay was doing one's best.
   The assigned topic was the media's role in reporting on the
politicians' private lives. Miss Estes criticized Sen. Joseph Biden
of Delaware, the Democratic presidential candidate who admitted
plagiarizing part of a speech.
   Her essay began, ``For many years, the American people have been
producing shoddy manufactured products; their children have been
socially promoted and have received diplomas without really being
educated or appreciating the value of education.''
   Miss Estes plans to donate part of her prize money from the
annual Metro Public School Essay Contest to a shelter for the
homeless and use the rest for a trip to Hawaii.

   President Reagan sat down with two television
correspondents from Moscow on Friday for a 30-minute interview that
will be broadcast in the Soviet Union on May 27, two days before he
begins summit talks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The session was similar to the television interview Gorbachev

the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Washington. That interview lasted
one hour.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was
questioned by Valentin Zorin and Boris Kalyagin from Soviet
television.
   Fitzwater said the interview will be broadcast May 27 at 7 p.m.
Moscow time. A transcript is to be released at that hour to
reporters accompanying Reagan, who then will be visiting Helsinki,
Finland.
   ``They have agreed to carry the entire interview in its entirety
on Soviet TV _ approximately 30 minutes _ and then they are
entitled to cut it up for individual news segments as they want to
do,'' Fitzwater said.
   Joking about the president's performance, Fitzwater said, ``He
was exciting, stimulating, brilliant, forthcoming, decisive.''
   Gorbachev's interview with Brokaw, after being shown in the
United States, was broadcast in the Soviet Union. It covered arms
control, human rights and Afghanistan. However, the Soviet version
omitted a segment in which Gorbachev indicated that he talks with
his wife, Raisa, about top government affairs.
   In addition to the television interview, Reagan has approved
written responses that were prepared by his staff for questions
submitted in writing from a Soviet magazine, Fitzwater said.

   Devastating earthquakes have occurred
only every 200 to 400 years on the northern San Andreas Fault, says
a study that provides some comfort for San Franciscans worried
about a repeat of the deadly 1906 quake.
   California Institute of Technology geologist Carol S. Prentice,
who presented her study of earthquake frequency Friday at the
American Geophysical Union's spring meeting in Baltimore, said she
found evidence of six great quakes in the last 2,000 years along a
260-mile stretch of the fault. The last was the 1906 shaker that
killed at least 2,500 people.
   At this interval, it would mean that the San Francisco Bay area
is unlikely to have a devastating quake within the next 100 years
and possiby much longer, said Prentice's professor and co-author,
geologist Kerry Sieh.
   However, Sieh cautioned the study is preliminary, so while ``one
is tempted to conclude (with certainty) that a great earthquake is
not likely in the near future in Northern California, that would be
a premature conclusion at this point.''
   The study involved only the northern San Andreas. The Hayward
Fault and other faults in Northern California also pose a threat,
and the state Office of Emergency Services says the probability of
a damaging earthquake in the Bay area in the next 30 years is about
50 percent.
   So ``people shouldn't get too complacent'' because of the new
study, Prentice said Thursday in a telephone interview from
Washington.
   Prentice made excavations across the San Andreas near Point
Arena about 160 miles north of San Francisco and found evidence of
at least six large quakes in the last 2,000 years, suggesting an
occurrence of every 300 to 400 years.
   However, the study also found evidence the fault is building up
strain at a rate that suggests the interval between large quakes
might be only 200 years, Sieh said.
   The 1906 quake ruptured a stretch of fault that starts just
south of Cape Mendocino, then runs south through Point Arena, Marin
County and the San Francisco Peninsula to San Juan Bautista.
   Federal emergency officials have estimated a repeat of the quake
would kill up to 11,000 people, seriously injure up to 44,000 and
cause $38 billion in damage.
   For Southern California, forecasts of a great quake's advent are
grimmer. Based on other studies, including work by Sieh, the state
Office of Emergency Services says another major devastating quake
in Southern California is more than 50 percent likely within the
next 25 years.
   Federal officials have projected that a great quake on the
southern San Andreas would kill up to 14,000 people, injure up to
55,000 and cause $17 billion in damage.
   Sieh's research on the southern San Andreas Fault suggests great
quakes occur an average of every 140 years on the section from
Tejon Pass, northwest of Los Angeles, to Cajon Pass, north of San
Bernardino. The last such quake occurred in 1857.
   He also found the next segment to the southeast, from Cajon Pass
through Palm Springs to the Salton Sea, breaks in a great or major
quake an average of every 200 to 250 years, with the last such
quake more than 300 years ago, suggesting the segment is overdue
for a big quake.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Jail Release of Prostitute with AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prostitute arrested on charges of
attempted manslaughter for selling sex while carrying AIDS has been
sent home because of her failing health.
   Elizabeth Kay Sherouse, 24, was released from jail and placed
under house arrest.
   Ms. Sherouse was arrested five months ago after investigators
said she twice had sex with men knowing she carried the deadly
virus. The charges were later dismissed for lack of evidence, but
she remained in jail while the prosecution appealed the dismissal.
   On Thursday, Circuit Judge Michael Cycmanick reduced her bail
from $14,000 to $1,000 because of her declining health and a
doctor's prognosis that she had less than three years to live.
   ``There is no way this girl will physically be able to get on
the streets again,'' her attorney, William Sheaffer, said at the
hearing. ``I believe her last days should be spent with some degree
of dignity. We shouldn't allow her to die like we wouldn't allow
some animals to die.''
   The AIDS virus triggered severe infections in most of her vital
organs last month, said her doctor, Phillip Sanchez. She had
surgery, a seizure and almost died twice of heart failure, he said.
   ``I feel real great about going home,'' said Ms. Sherouse, frail
but smiling as she left the Orange County Jail. She was steadied by
her attorney.
   Sanchez wrote the judge that he counseled Ms. Sherouse about the
possibilities of transmitting the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome virus through sex, but added, ``The ability to understand
the gravity of the situation was found to be uninterpretable by the
patient.''
   Prosecutor Rick Bogle argued that her release could endanger the
public, noting she had ignored previous counseling against having
sex because she carried the AIDS virus.
   Her mother, Jeanette Sherouse, burst into tears when asked by
Sheaffer if her daughter's grave condition would make her watch her
daughter more closely. Mrs. Sherouse, a nurse's aide, said she and
her son would supervise her daughter.

   Senators exposed their personal finances to
public view today _ sort of _ disclosing such minutiae as $2,000
speech fees, a $60 refund for football tickets and the gift of a
``Lenox Octagonal Server.''
   There were the usual disclosures of millionaire status for many
members of what has been called the world's most exclusive club,
but Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia was not among
them. His assets were reported to be between $22,000 and $70,000.
   Every member of Congress is required to file an annual
disclosure form listing honoraria, gifts, assets, income and
liabilities. In most cases, members need only report the finances
in broad dollar ranges, such as $15,001 to $50,000. They are not
required to list their homes or furnishings.
   The wealthiest men in the Senate include, as usual, three with
the best-known names: John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., an heir to a
vast oil furtune, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and John Heinz,
R-Pa., of the ketchup family. Another is John C. Danforth, R-Mo., a
member of the family that formed the giant Ralston-Purina company.
   Among the others in the well-populated millionaire's club in
1987 were William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., Lowell
Weicker, R-Conn.
   At the opposite end of the scale, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.,
listed as his only assets the cash value _ less than $5,000 _ of a
life insurance policy and $7,037 retirement equity earned as a
member of the Maryland House of Delegates.
   Although he was not required to do so, Sarbanes listed the value
of his Baltimore residence in the $100,000 to $250,000 range and
disclosed he owes less than $10,000 on the 20-year, 7.75 percent
mortgage he placed on it in 1970.
   Also among the least rich, Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii,
listed assets of $19,000 to $70,000 and liabilities of $10,000 to
$15,000. Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., had assets of $21,000
to $45,000 and liabilities in the $20,000 to $30,000 range.
   One of the senators who usually is in the millionaire's group,
former astronaut John Glenn, D-Ohio, asked for an extension of time
for his filing for the second straight year.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., appeared eligible for membership
based on the reports, which are only guideposts to actual wealth.
Cranston listed assets of $901,507 to $1.229,496 but his
liabilities _ also listed in ranges _ were $65,002 to $150,000.
   Kennedy listed at least $596,747 income but not his assets. He
also listed no honoraria.
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., filing his first report, had assets
in the range of $1.9 million to $3.3 million and liabilities of $1
million to $1.8 million. He listed income of $681,488 to $694,488.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., put down assets in the range of $1.2
million to $2 million and liabilities of $590,000 to $1.1 million.
Assets in the names of his dependent children totaled $1 million to
$1.3 million and more.
   Sen. Quentin N. Burdick, D-N.D., listed assets of $457,000 to
$1.2 million with no liabilities; Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
listed asets in the $900,000 to $1.9 million range with liabilities
of $375,000 to $565,000. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., had assets of $1.2
million to $1.6 million and higher and liabilities of $165,000 to
$400,000.
   Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas did better than
his Democratic counterpart, Byrd. Dole reported assets of between
$275,290 and $579,277, mostly invested in mutual funds, Keogh plans
and rental property in his hometown of Russell, jointly owned with
his daughter.
   Dole, who had been a contender for the Republican presidential
nomination until he quit the race in April, reported income between
$310,310 and $329,995, including his $99,500 Senate salary.
   He was popular on the speaking circuit, even while running for
the presidential nomination, taking in $106,050 for nearly four
dozen speeches, three articles and a videotape. He kept $26,050 and
gave $80,000 to charity.
   Dole also received $50,000 royalties from a joint autobiography
with his wife, Elizabeth, and $30,000 for a daily radio talk show
with Sen. Edward Kennedy. Mrs. Dole, a former Secretary of
Transportation, had income between $221,538 and $301,025, received
more than $100,000 from a blind trust and $50,000 from the book.
   Byrd's outside income consisted mostly of honoraria for
speeches, most of them at the $2,000 limit, but also one to a
Baptist church for $200 and one to a high school for $100. He alwo
wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times that brought him $250.
   Byrd receives a salary of $99,500 a year. His income for
speeches and the article totaled $41,050. He gave $2,043 to
charity, putting him just under his personal limit of $39,800. The
rest of his income was from interest in checking, savings and IRA
accounts.
   He listed a single gift, the Lenox server. Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., also listed a single gift: a framed illustration of the
Battle of Corinth worth $175, from the Chamber of Commerce of
Corinth, Miss. Sen. Sanford put a $275 silver statue from the
Durham Chamber of Commerce on his form.
   Former presidential candidate Paul Simon of Illinois, a
Democrat, listed assets of $361,978 and liabilities of $219,243.
His income for the year was $121,850, of which $22,826 was in
honoraria.
   His filing included a $3,000 expense reimbursement from his
campaign, a $1,250 reimbursement from Northwest Airlines for lost
luggage, a $60 ticket refund from the Chicago Bears of the National
Football League and royalties of $478 from 11 books he has written.
   One of the Senate millionaires is Alan Dixon of Illinois, whose
income was $143,141 to $191,324. His assets include $487,000 in
real estate _ homes in Washington and Belleville, Ill., a lot at
Rose Hill Plantation in South Carolina and half-interests in a
Florida condominium and land at Lake Kinkaid in southern Illinois _
as well as stocks, bonds, notes, mortgages, three cars and savings
of nearly $317,000.
   Rockefeller, the senator with the oil-plated name, listed at
least $390,000 as income, assets of at least $882,008. But as an
heir to the Standard Oil fortune and one of the richest men in
Congress, Rockefeller is far wealthier than these numbers suggest.
Most of his wealth is held in three trusts. Two were established by
his grandfather, John D. Rockefeller Jr. The other is a blind trust
Rockefeller established when he became governor of West Virginia.
   Rockefeller's wife _ Sharon Percy Rockefeller, the daughter of
former Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill. _ also is wealthy. Her income is
listed as at least $258,115, with assets of at least $617,010.
Their four children are beneficiaries of trusts worth at least
$1,045,010.

<HEAD>Reagan Assures Cuban-Americans Freedom in Cuba Is `Non-Negotiable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan told a cheering audience of
Cuban-Americans on Friday that he considers the freedom of Cuba ``a
non-negotiable issue.''
   Reagan spoke to a small gathering in the White House Roosevelt
Room at a ceremony marking the 86th anniversary of the
establishment of the Cuban republic.
   The walls of the room are adorned with pictures and other
memorabilia of Theodore Roosevelt, who led a detachment of
volunteer cavalry known as the Rough Riders in action in Cuba
during the Spanish-American war in 1898.
   Vice President George Bush stood by the president's side as he
spoke.
   The audience frequently interrupted, standing to applaud and cry
out ``bravo.''
   Reagan ended his speech ``Viva Cuba libre,'' or ``Long live free
Cuba.''
   ``Cuban-Americans have demonstrated that free people can come
together unencumbered by tyranny, and I am confident the time will
come when the spirit of freedom will reign in Cuba itself,'' he
said.
   ``Having suffered personally the evils of communism, you have an
acute understanding of the danger that communist expansion poses to
this hemisphere,'' Reagan told the Cuban-Americans. ``You have
stood in support of people everywhere who seek freedom, such as the
people of Nicaragua.''
   ``Let me assure you, as far as this administration is concerned,
the freedom of Cuba is a non-negotiable issue.''
   ``We will never, ever negotiate away the dream of every
Cuban-American, a dream that I too hold in my heart, that Cuba will
again join the family of free and democratic nations,'' the
president said.
   ``Only 90 miles of ocean separate the island of Cuba from the
United States, but between our governments is an unbridgeable
gulf.''

   Savings institutions will be required
beginning Oct. 1 to offer prospective borrowers a clear and concise
description of their adjustable-rate mortgage programs, the
government said Friday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates 3,120
federally insured savings institutions, said S&Ls must provide the
information either when a mortgage application form is offered or
before the borrower pays any non-refundable fees, whichever occurs
first.
   Lenders must include an historic example of how mortgage
payments would have changed over the past 15 years using the index
or formula on which interest rate changes are based.
   S&Ls must also notify borrowers at least 25 days in advance of
any change in monthly payments.
   The new rules were adopted last week and became effective
Monday, however the bank board did not announce adoption of the
regulation until Friday. S&Ls will have until Oct. 1 to begin
complying.
   They are similar to rules for banks and bank holding companies
adopted in December by the Federal Reserve Board and by the
Comptroller of the Currency in March.

   Elementary school lessons still play a
role in his life, the Boston Celtics' Kevin McHale told a
fifth-grade class that produced a biography of the basketball
player, the school's most famous alumnus.
   ``I still remember the books you read for us back in school,''
McHale wrote to Pat Mattson, who was his language arts teacher in
the late 1960s. ``I read a book or two every week now. It must have
been that good schooling.''
   Earlier this year, students in Mattson's creative writing class
at Greenhaven Elementary School produced nine pages of verse
titled, ``The Tall Tale of Kevin McHale.''
   But McHale first saw a copy of the book when interviewed by CBS
Sports for a feature on the class project. The feature was
broadcast May 8 during half-time of a National Basketball
Association game.
   ``Like most things that happen, I was one of the last people to

   Art thieves smashed a window in
the Municipal Museum early Friday and stole three masterpieces
worth up to $52 million, including works by Vincent Van Gogh and
Paul Cezanne. It was the biggest art theft in Dutch history.
   The burglars broke a ground-floor window before dawn in the
museum's north wing, which is relatively sheltered from public
view, said museum spokesman Maarten Bertheux. The thieves then
walked through five galleries to reach the room where the works
were hanging, he said.
   Stolen were ``Carnations,'' an 1888 work by the Dutch painter
Van Gogh; ``Bottle with Apples,'' a still life painted in 1894 by
the French master Cezanne; and ``The House of Maitre Billaud in
Nevers,'' an 1874 painting by Dutch artist Johan Jongkind.
   Two other valuable Van Gogh paintings, ``The Diggers'' and ``The
Rocking Chair,'' were hanging in the same gallery but were not
taken.
   Rini Dippel, the museum's deputy director, said they may have
been left because they are substantially larger than the others.
   Museum director Wim Beeren said the stolen paintings are worth
an estimated $52 million, although experts from Christie's auction
house in London estimated their worth at $11 million.
   The Municipal Museum houses a collection of about 3,000 works
from the 19th and 20th centuries and is next door to the Van Gogh
Museum, which has 220 paintings by the Dutch master, the world's
largest collection.
   Beeren and other art experts speculated that the theft was
commissioned by a private art collector, since the Van Gogh and the
Cezanne are too famous to be sold publicly and since the other Van
Gogh works weren't taken.
   ``I've got the impression that they chose the paintings with a
clear purpose in mind,'' Beeren said. ``This'll go straight to
somebody's room or home.''
   ``There's a very good reporting system (on art thefts) these
days ... If they're offered for sale at a bona fide art dealer or
auction house, that'll be known right away,'' said Fred Leeman of
the Van Gogh Museum.
   Bertheux told The Associated Press that there was no one in the
museum at the time of the burglary. Around-the-clock surveillance
by security personnel was abolished in 1975 to save money.
   Authorities were alerted when an alarm went off about 5 a.m.,
but there were conflicting accounts on when the theft was
discovered.
   Police spokesman Joost van Wijngaarden said police arrived at
5:10 a.m., entered the museum through the broken window and ``found
nothing missing.''
   He said officers then left the museum and that private security
guards discovered the theft about 90 minutes later.
   But Bertheux said museum officials discovered the theft almost
immediately when they entered the building's main lobby and ran
past the targeted gallery on their way to investigate the broken
window.
   ``This is a terrible loss of prestige for (museum) security,''
Beeren told reporters at an impromptu news conference. He appeared
shaken and pale.
   The paintings were not insured against theft.
   Beeren said he based his loss estimate on the fact that ``there
is a Van Gogh involved, and recent price developments (for Van
Goghs) have been dramatic.''
   In March 1987, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' fetched $39.8 million
at a London auction. In November, an unidentified collector paid
$53 million for Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in New York.
   Ms. Dippel said experts from Christie's based their estimate on
black and white photographs of the paintings in a museum catalog.
According to Christie's, the Van Gogh is worth $1.6 million to $2.1
million; the Cezanne is worth $7.9 million; and the Jongkind is
worth $147,000.
   The nation's last major art theft was in February 1987, when
nine pieces, including works by French painter Jean-Auguste Renoir
and Dutch master Pieter Bruegel, vanished from an art gallery in
the southern city of Maastricht.
   The loss was estimated at $2.65 million. The paintings were
never recovered.

<HEAD>Merchant Seamen to Sail Again - This Time As Veterans</HEAD>

   Merchant seamen who braved
submarine-infested waters to keep weapons flowing to World War II
battlefields will sail again, finally recognized as veterans of a
war that ended four decades ago.
   Their voyage on Saturday will last only a few hours, but it will
be aboard a ship sure to recall for many the hazardous days of
their youth. The five-hour cruise will be on the SS Jeremiah
O'Brien, America's last Liberty Ship still in operating condition.
   The O'Brien will go out the Golden Gate where wreaths will be
cast on the sea in memory of the more than 5,000 merchant seamen
who died in the war _ they, too, veterans at last.
   In January, prodded by a federal judge, the Defense Department
recognized the civilian sailors who served on ocean-going merchant
ships during World War II as veterans _ a title it extended earlier
to 13 other civilian groups, including women who served as wartime
telephone operators in Europe.
   The designation makes the former seamen eligible for certain
veterans benefits, including the right to be buried in a national
cemetery.
   George Tuttle, 72, who will be aboard the O'Brien on Saturday,
said the delay in the granting of veteran status stemmed in part
from jealousy.
   ``There was a lot of animosity toward us from members of the
other services,'' said Tuttle, who was a captain on a ship that was
sunk by a mine off Italy. ``We got a lot more money and our pay
went up when we entered a combat zone. Some guys thought of us as
draft dodgers.''
   But he noted that there were also benefits provided to members
of the Army, Navy and other services but not to merchant sailors.
   ``For one thing, our pay stopped if we were captured,'' he said.
   The merchant sailors are old now, and few will use such benefits
as the GI Bill, which helped educate so many former sailors and
soldiers.
   ``Most are dead,'' said Tuttle. ``There were about 250,000
members of the merchant marine but only about 80,000 are still
alive.''
   There's one benefit Tuttle is particularly glad he is now
entitled to.
   ``There'll be an American flag given to my relatives when I
die,'' he said with pride.
   Tuttle, like many former merchant sailors living in the San
Francisco Bay area, spends time working as a volunteer on the
441-foot O'Brien, the last unaltered example of 2,751 Liberty Ships
built between 1941 and 1945.
   Except for the annual cruise, the ship stays docked near
Fisherman's Wharf where it is visited each year by thousands of
tourists who want to see the type of ship that was part of
``America's Bridge to Victory.''
   Another sailor veteran, William Krasnosky, 76, recalls voyages
during which ``the Germans hit us with everything _ subs, planes.''
   In one case, his convoy was abandoned by the British destroyer
that was escorting it, and 23 out of 33 of the merchant ships were
sunk by the Germans.
   ``But I never got sunk,'' said Krasnosky, who plans to make the
trip on the O'Brien. ``I was lucky.''
   ``The guys at the union hiring hall would all want to know what
ship I was going to sign on,'' he said. ``They'd want to sign too
'cause I was so lucky.''

   A teen-ager charged with killing a
playmate during a ``Dungeons and Dragons'' game three years ago
pleaded guilty as jury selection in his retrial was to begin.
   ``I just wish this never happened,'' David K. Ventiquattro, 17,
of Herrings said Thursday before pleading guilty to the Nov. 12,
1985, shotgun slaying of 11-year-old Martin Howland.
   Ventiquattro was preparing to stand trial in Jefferson County
Court a second time in the slaying. His 1986 conviction was
overturned for shooting Howland, whom he testified had to be killed
because he had become an evil character in the fantasy game, which
involves medieval monsters.
   The Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court ruled in March
that the youth's confession was inadmissible because he was
isolated from his parents and attorney during eight hours of
questioning by state police.
   Onondaga County Judge J. Kevin Mulroy sentenced the teen-ager to
five years-to-life at the Brookwood Center, a youth detention
facility in Claverack, where he already has served 2{ years.
   Defense attorney William J. McClusky said Ventiquattro pleaded
guilty in hopes of avoiding incarceration at a maximum-security
prison for adults. Ventiquattro also waived his right to appeal.

<TEXT>
   Indiana censored it, the Fish Head Kazoo
Band played it and the state of Washington rejected it. But
ignoring the three-chord rock classic ``Louie, Louie'' will be
difficult in many cities this weekend.
   Not in Indianapolis, however.
   The Indiana city is one of 45 around the country holding
``Louie, Louie'' parades this year to raise funds for the Leukemia
Society of America.
   But in Indianapolis, where a national movement to ban the song
and its supposedly obscene lyrics began nearly 25 years ago, the
parade will be in late June or early July.
   It can't be held this weekend because of scheduling conflicts
associated with time trials for the Indianapolis 500 auto race,
said Deborah Eschenbacher, executive director of the group's local
chapter.
   The Leukemia Society's national headquarters, recognizing the
song's history, even sent copies of the lyrics in its information
packets.
   ``They wanted to make sure that we, as executive directors, knew
that they were all OK words, something we could publish,'' Ms.
Eschenbacher said.
   Thirty parades were scheduled this weekend in cities including
Washington, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Columbus, Ohio, and St.
Louis, Mo.
   The Philadelphia parade, in its fifth year, has drawn 70,000
spectators and 50 floats, brigades and marching bands. The groups,
who play only ``Louie, Louie,'' include the Bucks County Fish Head
Kazoo Band and the Future Yuppies of America Brigade.
   The rhythm-and-blues ditty concerning a sailor telling a
bartender about his girlfriend has come a long way since it was
first recorded in 1956 by the Pharaohs.
   The 1963 version by the Kingsmen, a Portland, Ore., bar band,
reached No. 2 in the charts and the controversy began early the
following year when an Indiana teen-ager wrote then-Gov. Matthew
Welsh.
   If the song was played at a slow speed, the boy said, the lyrics
sounded dirty. Welsh asked the state's radio stations not to play
the song.
   The matter eventually was turned over to the Marion County
prosecutor, the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S.
Justice Department.
   Leroy K. New, chief trial deputy of the prosecutor's office,
said he heard nothing obscene.
   ``The record is an abomination of out-of-tune guitars, an
overbearing jungle rhythm and clanging cymbals,'' he said.
   The FCC, meanwhile, pronounced the recording ``unintelligible at
any speed.''
   Dick Peterson, an original member of the Kingsmen, said the song
had become a theme of sorts in the Northwest before his
instrumental group decided to record it in hopes of landing a job
on a cruise ship.
   ``Jack Ely, our original singer, knew more words than anybody
else, so he yelled the majority of it,'' Peterson said in a 1986
interview. ``It was basically done to feature the drums and the
guitar, so Jack just kind of yelled into the drum mike. It turned
out that you couldn't understand what was being said, part of the
beauty of the recording process.''
   The song was revived in the hit movie ``Animal House'' and was
selected by a wine cooler company to promote its product.
California Coolers even put the Kingsmen on the road for a series
of free concerts a couple of years ago.
   Rhino Records has issued a ``Best of Louie, Louie,'' complete
with versions of the song as done by the Sandpipers, the Rice
University Marching Band and others. And there was a movement to
have the tune proclaimed the Washington state song three years ago,
which failed.
   As for those controversial lyrics to ``Louie, Louie,'' which was
written by Richard Berry in 1956:

   The U.S. Navy has decided to recover the
wreckage of a helicopter gunship that went down in the Persian
Gulf, rather than blowing it up on the seabed, a military official
said Friday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Navy
reversed its decision ``to better enable investigators to determine
the cause of the crash,'' specifically whether the Marine Corps
AH-1 Cobra was lost to gunfire or missiles.
   The helicopter vanished on a night reconnaissance mission April
18, a few hours after U.S. and Iranian naval forces had fought a
series of day-long clashes in the southern gulf.
   It went down about 15 miles southeast of Abu Musa island, where
the Iranians have a military base.
   Tehran later claimed that its forces shot down the helicopter.
The Iranians said they had recovered the wreckage, but offered no
evidence.
   U.S. officials have said the Cobra's pilots reported in their
last message that they were being tracked by hostile radar.
   There were no reports or indications of weapons being fired in
the area afterward, the officials said.
   The Navy announced several days ago that the wreckage, in
several pieces about 130 feet deep off the United Arab Emirates
coast, would be ``destroyed in place'' by underwater demolition
divers.
   But Friday's statement said that ``in order to facilitate
further investigation, given the condition of the wreckage, the
decision was made to recover the aircraft wreckage except for the
ordnance.'' The weapons would be ``destroyed separately,'' it said.
   The debris will be lifted by a seagoing crane that has been at
the crash site for the past week with two salvage tugboats.
   The U.S. official also said the bodies of the two pilots,
recovered earlier, will be flown to Dover Air Base in Dover, Del.,
on Friday.
   The two Marines, Capt. Kenneth Hill, 33 and Capt. Stephen
Leslie, 30, based at New River, N.C., have been declared ``Killed
in Action,'' although the cause of the crash has yet to be
estabished.
   Navy officers said that ruling could be made even if the
aircraft was not actually shot down, but crashed while trying to
evade hostile fire.
   The pilots were the only U.S. casualties in the April 18
clashes, and raised to 46 the number of Americans killed in
military operations related to the gulf in the past year.
   The biggest single casualty toll was 37 sailors killed aboard
the U.S. frigate Stark May 17 last year when the warship came under
a missile attack by an Iraqi warplane.
   Baghdad said the pilot had mistaken the Stark for an Iranian
warship.

<HEAD>Iran Again Says It Is ``At War'' With U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's powerful Parliament speaker on
Friday repeated his government's claim that Tehran is at war with
the United States and called for an arms buildup to fight the
Americans in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The Americans have officially entered into a war with us,''
Hashemi Rafsanjani told Revolutionary Guards commanders. He was
quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, which was
monitored in Nicosia.
   ``We are really at war with the United States at the present
time.''
   Six newly arrived U.S. warships took up station in the Arabian
Sea, and two others sailed into the gulf.
   But there was no sign of hostilities as the U.S. frigates
Pharris and Elmer Montgomery, accompanied by the missile frigate
John H. Sides, passed through the Strait of Hormuz where Iranian
speedboats have attacked two commercial ships in recent days.
   The Pharris and Elmer Montgomery are part of an eight-ship
battle group, headed by the aircraft carrier Forrestal, that
arrived in the Arabian Sea this week to provide air support for
U.S. convoy and patrol operations in the gulf.
   Rafsanjani also told Moslem worshipers at a weekly prayer
session in Tehran University that if the United States fought Iran,
``they must wait to receive lots of their youths' dead bodies.''
   Iranian leaders have repeatedly said they consider that their
country has been at war with the United States since the U.S. Navy
buildup in the gulf in July to protect American-flagged ships from
Iranian attack.
   IRNA quoted Rafsanjani as saying: ``Should this war extend to
new frontiers, the Americans will simply take delivery of the
bodies of Americans throughout the world.''
   Tension heightened since the Americans destroyed Iranian
offshore oil platforms and sank an Iranian minelayer in the gulf
last year.
   U.S. warships and aircraft sank or disabled six Iranian vessels
in a string of clashes April 18 in the most serious confrontation
since the U.S. intervention.
   Iranian anger mounted after a long-range raid by Iraqi warplanes
on the Larak Island oil terminal in the southern gulf May 14 in
which five tankers were set ablaze.
   Iran claimed the Americans jammed its radar and radio systems to
help the Iraqis. U.S. officials denied that.
   Rafsanjani reiterated that allegation Friday and said: ``U.S.
ships guided Iraqi forces and caused trouble for our defensive
forces,'' Iran reported.
   Despite the fiery rhetoric, the Iranians are clearly outgunned
by the U.S. Navy in the gulf, especially since two of their
frigates were either sunk or crippled in last month's naval clashes.
   Those two British-built warships comprised half the major
operational warships the Iranians had.
   The Iranians still have several missile boats and a fleet of
armed speedboats manned by Revolutionary Guards, which have
attacked two neutral merchant ships in the gulf this week after a
three-week lull.
   Following Baghdad's recapture last month of the Faw peninsula in
southern Iraq, seized by the Iranians in February 1986, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini dismissed the armed forces chief of staff, Brig.
Gen. Ismael Sohrabi.
   Unconfirmed reports from Tehran noted that other senior officers
have been replaced, heightening the belief that Khomeini seeks a
more aggressive strategy to make up for the chain of recent defeats.
   Rafsanjani, closely allied with the Revolutionary Guards Corps,
is considered the most powerful figure in Iran after Khomeini and
is the revolutionary patriarch's represenative on the Supreme
Defense Council.
   The council determines Iran's military strategy in the
7{-year-old war.
   The Supreme Defense Council called April 18 on Iranians to fight
the United States.
   A Foreign Ministry statement on the same day warned the United
States to expect a severe response from Iran, alleging that
American military helicopters fought on the Iraqi side in the
recapture of Faw.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Lesbianism, Drug Addiction at Penal Colony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women prisoners in a Soviet penal colony are
driven to lesbianism and drugs by a demeaning life of ugly clothes
and too many rules, a newspaper reported Friday in an unprecedented
article about prison conditions.
   ``The regime of the colony gives rise to a destructive process
in a woman,'' a prisoner identified only as Kutsyenkova told the
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   ``Marching in formation, ugly clothes, banging of iron,
commands, meatless diet _ this makes one insipid, dull, leads one
to search for emotional relief at any price,'' said the inmate, a
former college lecturer whose doctoral dissertation was about the
family.
   She told the newspaper that prisoners could fight off ``a
breakdown'' for five years at the most, but ``then the organism
catastrophically weakens'' and prisoners seek solace in smoking,
lesbianism and narcotics.
   Kutsyenkova said the prisoner ``experiences an atrophy of will
and initiative, a growing of uncontrollable rage.''
   The article was one of the first about conditions in camps for
women prisoners. Conditions at the country's notorious penal
colonies and labor camps for men, described in the books of exile
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, were once taboo subjects for the Soviet
media. But Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of open
discussion of the country's problems has produced several reports
exposing deficiencies in the criminal justice system.
   The article described conditions at Corrective Labor Womens
Colony No. 65-15 in Kuybyshev, 620 miles southeast of Moscow on the
Volga River.
   The man in charge of the prisons, Alexander V. Vlasov,
acknowledged in a commentary accompanying the article that
improvements are needed.
   ``Quite a few problems have piled up in the system of corrective
labor institutions,'' wrote Vlasov, minister of internal affairs.
``Perestroika is needed also in this sphere in which the human
factor should be made predominant too.''
   Perestroika is Gorbachev's term for his administrative and
economic overhaul of Soviet society.
   The article said punishment of prisoners is often
counterproductive, causing them to get into more trouble rather
than lead them to rehabilitation.
   Kutsyenkova said some inmates don't want to be freed because
they have no families left outside after serving long prison terms.
Two freed prisoners slept several nights outside the colony gate,
``praying to be taken back into the colony'' because they couldn't
live on their own, the article said.
   The article did not say why Kutsyenkova had been jailed but said
the colony's inmates had murdered husbands and children, taken
bribes or engaged in other forms of corruption. Among the inmates
were a director of a large store, senior lecturers at colleges, a
chief bookkeeper and an engineer-economist, Sovietskaya Rossiya
said.
   Prisoners are forced to work shifts as long as 10-12 hours in
sewing shops with poor ventilation, the article said.
   Punishment of 10-15 days in an isolation cell is meted out for
such things as going out without a shawl, loudly saying goodnight
to cellmates and smoking in a prohibited area, the newspaper said.
   Vlasov said his ministry is trying to improve the quality of its
personnel at the colonies and labor camps. New criminal and
corrective labor codes are being drafted to make the punishment
more appropriately fit a convict's crime and to provide for a
reduction of sentences in some cases.
   An experiment is planned in which prisoners will be released
early for good work and good behavior.
   He did not specifically address the problems of lesbianism and
drug addiction among the women prisoners.
   In May, the Tass news agency carried a report saying life in one
camp outside Moscow is hard but that prisoners are treated fairly
and given free time and an opportunity to get an education.
   Soviet officials say the camps are designed to make inmates take
a conscientious attitude toward work and teach them to abide by the
law. Western organizations estimate the camps hold 1 million people.

   Thousands of paramilitary troops and
police fanned out across Punjab state Friday and raided Sikh
hideouts after reports that militant Sikhs murdered 43 people in an
overnight crime spree.
   Police said a security red alert was issued in Punjab, where
Sikhs have allegedly murdered 195 people since May 9, when a
government hold on the Sikhs' Golden Temple began.
   The siege of the holy shrine ended Wednesday with the surrender
of the last of the militants holed up inside. At least 42 people,
mainly Sikh militants, were killed during the 10-day standoff.
   Reporters were taken to the temple Friday for the first time
since the siege and saw bloodstains, bullet marks, and arms and
ammunition.
   The temple complex, normally visited by 10,000 pilgrims a day,
looked shabby and deserted. A stench came from canisters used by
the radicals as toilets during the siege.
   The Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, lay under a
cloth on the floor. There was a burn mark across the cloth that
appeared to have been made by a bullet passing close to its surface.
   At least 43 people were killed in seven separate attacks in
Punjab late Thursday and Friday, United News of India reported.
   Five of the victims killed Thursday night were Hindu migrant
workers from the eastern Indian state of Bihar, who were lined up
against a wall and shot, UNI said.
   It was the second attack on migrant workers this week,
suggesting that the extremists were trying to undercut the mainstay
of Punjab state's economy, which is agriculture.
   Other victims Thursday night included six killed in Jalandhar
District, six killed in Bhatinda District, and three people were
shot to death in separate incidents around the state.
   On Friday, five people were killed in a bomb attack on a bus
near the town of Pathankot, 90 miles north of Amritsar. Police
imposed a curfew in Pathankot after 10 others were killed in
separate bomb attacks, UNI said.
   Eight other deaths occured in Gurdaspur district on Friday.
   ``We fear Sikh terrorists will start a new wave of violence, in
fact they are already on a killing spree,'' the director general of
Punjab police, K.P.S. Gill, told reporters in Amritsar.
   He said police were put on extended hours and were under order
to arrest and interrogate any suspect. UNI said police imposed a
curfew on Pathankot.
   ``Time has come to hit the terrorists with iron fist, and this
is what we are going to do,'' he said.
   At least 9,000 police and paramilitary troops raided suspected
hideouts of Sikh radicals in Amritsar, Gurdashpur and Jalandhar
districts, a police officer told The Associated Press. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The districts are considered strongholds of Sikh militants, who
have been fighting since 1982 for an independent homeland in
Punjab. The Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, has become a
base for guerrillas waging the war.
   Gill said authorities recovered 44 weapons, including
Chinese-made AK-47 rifles, light machine guns, grenades and 4,900
rounds of ammunition from inside the temple Friday. He said police
also found $340,000 in Indian currency.
   The latest killings raised to at least 1,131 the number of
people murdered by Sikh extremists in Punjab this year. In all of
1987, about 1,030 people died.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by Hindus. Sikhs are a minority in India but comprise a
majority in Punjab.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted
unanimously Friday to approve a full-power license to Commonwealth
Edison Co. for the second reactor at its Braidwood nuclear power
plant near Chicago.
   The decision came five months after the commission granted the
utility a low-power license for the reactor, NRC spokesman Frank
Ingram said.
   The reactor will be brought up to full power gradually and is
expected to be fully operational by fall, generating 1.1 kilowatts
of electricity, the company said.
   The first of Braidwood's two reactors was licensed for
full-power operation on July 2, 1987, Ingram said.
   The NRC action brought to 12 the number of fully licensed
reactors Edison operates at six Illinois plants and marked the
completion of a nuclear-plant construction program it began in the
early 1970s, the utility said.

   Farmers and members of the political
opposition tore down the plaque of Taiwan's legislature, and
smashed and burned police vehicles in clashes with authorities that
injured more than 100 people, police said.
   Riot police wielded clubs and erected barbed-wire barricades to
disperse demonstrators in separate battles outside the legislature,
a police station and the headquarters of the governing Nationalist
Party.
   About 3,000 protesters demanding government assistance for
farmers chanted slogans and marched through Taipei streets before
the battles, which marked the worst protest violence since the
government eased restrictions on demonstrations last year.
   Taipei Deputy Police Chief Wang Hwa-cheng told reporters that
the injured included policemen, protesters and reporters. He said
police had detained 31 protesters.
   Wang said an unidentified protester exploded a firebomb outside
the police station. The police official did not say if the
explosion caused any injuries or damage.
   The demonstrators hurled rocks and clubs at 200 riot police who
had blocked the entrance to the Legislative Yuan, where they had
planned to hand in a petition for more farm aid.
   After police dragged three protesters inside, demonstrators
stormed the police lines, broke several windows and tore down the
``Legislative Yuan'' plaque on the building, the home of Taiwan's
highest lawmaking body.
   Police beat back the protesters with clubs and rocks and
dispersed the crowd with water cannons. But it regrouped and
marched to Nationalist Party headquarters to demand the release of
the three protesters.
   More protesters were detained in clashes outside the party
headquarters and a police station.
   Demonstrators burned one police motorcycle and smashed five
police cars during the fighting at the police station, police said.
   Wang said a load of rocks was found hidden in one of the vans
used by the protesters.
   Protesters said the government has helped industry but has
ignored farmers, who have suffered because of low crop prices. One
protest banner read: ``Our president holds a doctoral degree in
agriculture, but farmers are suffering.''
   The state-run Broadcasting Corporation of China reported that
President Lee Teng-hui was deeply saddened by the news of the
clashes and had instructed the Cabinet to act in accordance with
the law.
   Demonstrations were banned in Taiwan until martial law was
lifted last year.

<HEAD>University Gets $8.5 Million From Nautilus Founder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur A. Jones, whose invention of
Nautilus exercise equipment revolutionized the fitness industry, on
Friday announced the gift of nearly $8.5 million to the University
of Florida.
   The donation will be shared by the school's Health Science
Center and Center for Exercise Science, Jones said.
   The center is operated by the colleges of Medicine and Health
and Human Performance. The center is testing Jones' latest
invention, a computerized machine designed to evaluate and
rehabilitate the lower back.
   Jones' donation of $8.47 million was announced at a morning news
conference at his 500-acre ranch near Ocala.
   ``I have a longstanding interest in physical training and
wellness, and my support of the University of Florida will boost
the research of lower back pain, one of man's most nagging
problems,'' Jones said.
   ``As the beneficiary of the largest gift in the history of the
University of Florida and our state university system, we welcome
the opportunity to join in his crusade against lower back
problems,'' University President Marshall Criser said.
   Officials said the health center's share of Jones' donation will
help pay for a $39 million research building under construction.
   In the past six years, Jones has donated more than $1 million
for medical research and continuing medical education programs, and
two years ago he funded the early clinical trials of his new lumbar
machine at the university with a $350,000 grant and equipment
donated by his MedX Corp.
   He sold his Nautilus empire in 1986 to devote his time and
energy to MedX, which began marketing the Lumbar Extension Machine
later that year.

   A wall of dirt collapsed at an building
renovation project today, killing one person and injuring another,
police said.
   A father-son team was working with two other men on a two-car
underground garage and elevator shaft at the four-story apartment
house, digging by hand when the accident occurred, according to
officials and witnesses.
   Marcelino Herrejon, 48, said his 20-year-old son, Pedro Herrejon
Velasquez, was killed in the accident in the city's Russian Hill
neighborhood.
   A 33-year-old man whose name was not immediately released was in
good condition at San Francisco General Hospital Mission Emergency,
said spokeswoman Ruth Rankin.
   Herrejon said he was outside the building when he heard the dirt
give way.
   ``I told them to run, but they didn't all get out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Police Say Teens Who Stole Blasting Caps Planned to Blow Up
Bridges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three teen-agers arrested late last week had
planned to blow up Illinois River bridges using 2,400 stolen
blasting caps, police said Friday.
   ``The kids who stole the dynamite caps were telling other kids
about it and they made comments about their plans to blow up
bridges,'' Peoria County Sheriff's Lt. Jerry Sample said. ``I
didn't take it as a joke at the time. And they certainly didn't
tell us it was a joke during interrogation.''
   Police arrested Kenneth Johnson, Tyrone Gayton and Christopher
Caho, all 17, in the May 9 theft of 2,400 explosive blasting caps.
   The caps are owned by a mining equipment and supply company.
Some are fused caps, which are extremely sensitive to shock, and
others are electric caps that can be detonated by radio
transmissions, police said.
   The suspects were jailed on felony burglary and theft charges.
Their bond ranges from $5,000 to $10,000.
   In an interview from jail, Johnson told the Peoria Journal Star
he was joking when he told friends he might blow up a bridge.
   ``Most of the things we did were just spur-of-the-moment
ideas,'' Johnson said. He added he planned to sell the caps.
   Sample said it's unclear whether the blasting caps would have
been powerful enough to blow up the highway bridges.
   ``The experts ... said that if you take 1,000 caps and put them
together, you can make a 10-foot crater in the ground,'' Sample
said. ``Whether they would hurt a steel bridge, we don't know.''
   He said all but about 60 of the stolen caps have been recovered.

<HEAD>Tutu Compares Apartheid to Nazism At Militant Campus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
compared apartheid to Nazism during an emotional ceremony Friday in
which he was installed as chancellor of the country's most militant
university.
   The black Anglican leader, who returned Thursday from a month in
Europe and the United States, also defended his controversial
appeals for tougher Western sanctions against South Africa.
   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' Tutu
told students and staff at the University of the Western Cape. ``I
want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can be done away with
without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''
   Tutu's calls for punitive sanctions were covered extensively by
the South African media during his trip. His remarks have been
denounced not only by the government but also by white and black
moderates who contend that sanctions will increase black
unemployment without inducing whites to accept reforms.
   ``There are those who seek to generate hysteria,'' Tutu said of
his critics. ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide
a viable, non-violent alternative.''
   Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, was greeted by several hundred cheering students when he
arrived at the university's main hall before the ceremony.
   His aides had to form a human wall around him as they ushered
him through a crowd that chanted the archbishop's name and waved
placards with slogans like ``Viva Sanctions'' and ``Viva Tutu.''
   Tutu said he accepted the chancellorship on behalf of detainees,
political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of ``this vile
and obscene system'' of apartheid.
   He said apartheid is ``so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical and
unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil
system _ Naziism.''
   As chancellor at University of the Western Cape, Tutu will be
the honorary leader of a university that the government established
for mixed-race students in 1960 as part of its segregated
educational system.
   He praised the university, near Cape Town, as South Africa's
``most potent academic institutional dissident.''
   In the past decade, the university has increased its black
enrollment from a handful to 13 percent of the 11,500 students. Its
students and staff have grown increasingly militant in their
opposition to apartheid, under which the nation's black majority
has no voice in national affairs.
   The university's chief administrator, Rector Jakes Gerwel, says
the campus will be ``an intellectual home for the left.''
   Tutu has been the target of government wrath for years because
of his support of sanctions. Recently, the archbishop has drawn an
unprecedented degree of criticism from white liberals.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper often critical of the
government, said in a recent editorial that blacks should insist
that Tutu live in the same conditions as the poorest unemployed
black squatter.

<HEAD>VA Raises Mortgage Interest Rate to 10.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration said Friday it was
raising its maximum interest rate for federally backed VA home
mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10.5 percent.
   VA spokeswoman Pam Siciliano said the agency was making the
change, which will take effect Monday, to reflect recent increases
in interest rates in financial markets.
   In the past 16 months, the VA rate has fluctuated between 8.5
percent and 10.5 percent. It has changed three times this year,
with the last change coming on April 4 when the rate was increased
from 9.5 percent to 10 percent. On Feb 1., the rate had been
lowered a full percentage point to 9.5 percent from 10.5 percent.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Friday that the
national average for 30-year, conventional mortgages _ those
without government guarantees _ rose to 10.52 percent this week
from 10.40 percent last week.
   The VA said that effective Monday a variety of other mortgage
rates will also rise by one-half percentage point. Graduated
payment mortgages will increase to 10.75 percent, home improvement
loans will rise to 12 percent and loans for mobile homes will
increase to 13 percent.
   The VA rates apply to new loans, not existing ones. VA mortgages
peaked at 17.5 percent in September 1981 before beginning a decline
and reaching a low for this decade of 8.5 percent in January 1987.

<HEAD>Armenians Demand Trials Be Opened To Observers And TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demonstrators converged on the Soviet Supreme
Court building Friday to demand that the trials of those charged in
ethnic rioting that killed 32 people be opened to television
cameras and Armenian observers.
   An Armenian activist said in a telephone interview from the
republic's capital, Yerevan, that the city was quiet after two
large public gatherings earlier in the week.
   The demonstration by about 30 Armenians across the street from
the downtown Supreme Court building indicated continuing skepticism
about the prosecution of those suspected of involvement in three
days of ethnic rioting that began Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani city
of Sumgait.
   Twenty-six Armenians and six Azerbaijanis were killed in the
violence, which was touched off by a dispute between the two
southern Soviet republics over control of the mountainous
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.
   Most residents of Nagorno-Karabakh are ethnic Armenians, and
they began agitating in February to be annexed to Armenia. That
touched off large demonstrations in Yerevan in support of their
demand.
   Uniformed and plainclothes police lined the sidewalk in front of
the six-story Supreme Court, but did not interfere with the protest.
   Armenian painter Koryun Nagapityan, 60, said he would present a
declaration to the Supreme Court from unions representing Armenian
artists, writers and other creative workers calling for ``full
openness'' in criminal proceedings against more than 80 people
charged in the rioting.
   Nagapityan read the declaration demanding several Armenians be
allowed to attend the Sumgait trials as observers, that proceedings
not be left in the hands of Azerbaijan authorities, that the names
of the dead and missing in Sumgait be published, and that the
trials be carried live on state-run TV.
   Demonstrators unrolled paper signs reading, ``Recognize the fact
of Armenian genocide in Sumgait,'' ``Strictly punish the organizers
of the Sumgait slaughter,'' and ``We know the names of 50 victims
of the Sumgait slaughter.''
   On Monday, an Azerbaijani metalworker, Talekh Salekh Ogli
Ismailov, was found guilty of premeditated murder in the rioting,
and given the maximum sentence of 15 years. Ismailov was the first
person convicted for taking part in the unrest.
   But Armenian sources said about 150,000 people gathered the next
day in Yerevan to stress that conviction of people involved in the
rioting did not meet their demands for solving the region's
problems.
   They said several thousand people also gathered in Stepanakert,
the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday, and that the
atmosphere in Nagorno-Karabakh was tense.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said in a telephone
conversation from Yerevan on Thursday that thousands more gathered
that evening in a main city square.
   Contacted Friday, he said the Thursday gathering apparently
broke up after about four hours with nothing happening, and that
the city was quiet on Friday.
   Demonstrators in Moscow differed over the sentence given
Ismailov. One Armenian who refused to give his name said: ``15
years is not the issue. The issue is bringing those who organized
the butchery to trial.''
   But Nagapityan shouted ``Why does the person who committed such
a crime have the right to live?''
   One middle-aged Russian woman who said she was married to an
Azeri argued briefly with the demonstrators, saying she disagreed
with their version of the events in Sumgait, but she soon left.
   The Soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction
over Nagorno-Karabakh, opting instead for a long, expensive program
of social and economic development.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of London's leading bookmakers has stopped
taking bets on the sex and name of the Duchess of York's unborn
child because her husband, Prince Andrew, was quoted as saying it
will be a girl called Annabel.
   The Sun newspaper reported Friday that Andrew told a Yorkshire
cricket team about his prediction this week after the team offered
him a child's cricket bat.
   ``It won't be much use. I'm sure we are having a girl,'' the
paper quoted Andrew as saying. It said the 28-year-old prince, a
Royal Navy helicopter pilot, told the guests the baby will be
called Annabel.
   In Britain, cricket is primarily played by boys.
   The former Sarah Ferguson, who married Queen Elizabeth II's son
in July 1986, is expecting their first child in August.
   Buckingham Palace said the report that the 28-year-old duchess
was expecting a girl was just speculation.
   ``Certainly, we are not in a position to talk about the private
coversations of the Duke of York. It's all speculation,'' said a
spokeswoman, who by custom was not identified.
   But Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for bookmakers William Hill,
said: ``We decided that the reported remarks of the Duke of York
represented an ideal opportunity for us to close the book on the
sex and name of the baby.''
   Sharpe said if Andrew's quote had surfaced soon after the
duchess become pregnant, ``we might not have given it credence.''
   But now that she's six months along, he said, ``they must have a
good idea of what they would call the baby, be it male or female.
After six months, if they want to know what the sex of the baby is,
it's very easy to find out.''
   In recent weeks, he said, Annabel went from a 20-1 to 3-1
favorite.
   ``The last time anything similar happened was when we had heavy
backing for the name William to be chosen as the name of Charles
and Diana's firstborn, and of course we all know what happened
there.''
   Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, and his wife, Princess
Diana, chose William as the name of their first son, who was born
in June 1982. William is second in line to the British throne
behind his father.
   Sharpe said William Hill had taken in about $56,000 in bets on
the name and sex of the baby.
   ``It's not as much as was bet on William, but it's more than on
Harry,'' he said. Prince Harry, the second son of Charles and
Diana, was born in September 1984.
   Sharpe said punters with an appetite for things royal would
still be able to bet on the weight of the duchess' baby and its
birth date. ``We're offering 7-1 against them being able to tell us
the date on which the baby is born,'' he said.

   The ninth person in the last two
months has died of malaria in this provincial capital, a newspaper
reported Friday.
   The Chronicle, controlled by the state-owned Mass Media Trust,
said the death Tuesday of Nancy Stewart raised questions about the
insistence by local health authorities that anti-malaria drugs were
needed only for people traveling out of the city.
   The paper said Mrs. Stewart had not traveled outside Bulawayo,
administrative capital of Matabeleland province in western
Zimbabwe, for more than a year.
   The City Council said last month the number of malaria cases
treated at municipal clinics in the city had soared from 50 in
October to 774 in March.
   No deaths have been reported in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe.
   Travelers to Zimbabwe routinely are advised to take anti-malaria
tablets when visiting rural areas but not cities.

   Scattered fog caused a 118-car

injured 19 people, five of them critically, police said.
   Police said drivers traveled at too high a speed after the fog
reduced drivers' visibility in a hilly region near the southern
West German city.
   ``It's the usual here. People do not know enough to slow down

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday backed
down from previous threats to act against the CBS television
network for a documentary about apartheid, but it warned of a
larger crackdown on the media.
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha told Parliament he was
considering the establishment of a government disciplinary body to
monitor the press and criticized what he called ``media
terrorists.''
   In December, Botha had said he might take unspecified actions
against the CBS News bureau in Johannesburg following the broadcast
in the United States of the documentary, ``Children of Apartheid.''
   The government had described the documentary, narrated by Walter
Cronkite, as ``blatant distortion.''
   Botha said Friday that the president of CBS News, Howard
Stringer, had issued a statement and that no action would be taken.
   The program consisted largely of interviews with young people in
South Africa, both black and white. Among those interviewed were
the daughters of President P.W. Botha and Nelson Mandela, the
jailed leader of the African National Congress.
   The government complained about the way the film was made as
well as the content. Botha said Cronkite and CBS producer Brian
Ellis had misled the government about the project and had failed to
obtain work permits.
   On Friday, Botha quoted CBS as saying that ``the circumstances
surrounding the making of the program were such as to give grounds
for objection by the South Africa government and (CBS) regretted
that it has not been meticulous in complying with South African
procedures regarding foreign media.''
   A CBS spokesman in New York said the network acknowledged that
South Africa has complex procedures and requirements that must be
followed.
   ``We're proud that the documentary was broadcast,'' said the
spokesman, Tom Goodman.
   Botha also said that the Media Council, an independent body
established by newspapers in 1983 to monitor the news industry, had
failed to act against publications that allegedly promoted
revolutionary causes.
   ``Freedom of expression in South Africa will not be allowed to
such an extent that it fosters chaos and revolt in the country,''
Botha said.
   Botha suggested that the government body would be aimed at
``media terrorists.''
   ``Media terrorists (are) people who do not have the guts to be
terrorists themselves,'' Botha said. ``I've heard it said it's an
ego trip by dropouts from other fields of endeavor.''
   South Africa already has extensive press restrictions. State of
emergency regulations in effect since June 1986 restrict reporting
on unrest, security force actions and many types of anti-government
protests.
   Two anti-apartheid newspapers have been suspended by the
government for publishing purported subversive material and several
others have been warned that they could face action.
   By South African law and custom, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Greek Leader Says Base Negotiations Likely to Continue Into 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou was quoted
Friday as saying he expects negotiations for a new agreement on
U.S. military bases in Greece to run into 1989.
   In an interview published in the satirical left-wing weekly
Pontiki, Papandreou said he did not think ``that we can easily
finish in 1988.''
   Under the present accord, the four American bases would have to
close down 17 months after it expires Dec. 31, 1988. A shutdown
notice has to be issued five months earlier.
   ``We'll denounce the agreement ... Therefore the bases won't
exist de jure (legally) after January 1989,'' Papandreou was quoted
as saying.
   Four U.S. military bases have been operating in Greece since the
early 1950s _ two near Athens and two on the southern island of
Crete.
   But Papandreou described the negotiations as ``very serious''
and said they could lead to an agreement.
   In Washington this week, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne Ridgway also said the United States was expecting Greece to
issue the shutdown notice.
   Greece wants a new agreement to be linked with progress on its
``national interests,'' a reference to longstanding regional
disputes with Turkey.
   U.S. officials want to avoid mixing regional politics in the
negotiations.
   Greece and Turkey are NATO allies but have differences over
Aegean airspace and seabed mineral rights as well as the military
status of some Greek islands.
   They also have disputes over the divided island of Cyprus, where
the Turkish army invaded in 1974 after a short-lived coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
   Turkish Cypriots declared the northern third of the island an
independent state in 1983.

   He said the costs included construction work and maintenance of
a permanent garrison of 2,000 soldiers on the Falklands, as well as
military spending during the 1982 war between Argentina and Britain.
   Britain ousted an Argentine invasionary force from the South
Atlantic archipelago in a 74-day war.

   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk unveiled
the party line against Republican nominee-in-waiting George Bush on
Friday, calling him ``a quintessential elitist establishment
Republican country-clubber'' and a do-nothing public official.
   Kirk's broadside came during a meeting of the Association of
Democratic State Chairs, which drew party leaders from throughout
the country to review arrangements for the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta this summer.
   Kirk said Bush ``has neither the toughness to govern nor the
compassion to care. ... It's debutante balls and `deep doo-doo'
when he speaks for himself. But when his image-makers tell him what
to do, it's `kick a little ass' and climb aboard an 18-wheeler.''
   The phrase ``deep doo-doo'' has been attributed to the vice
president, and after his debate with Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 he said he had ``kicked ass.''
   Kirk said the challenge for Democrats this fall is to ``make
sure that when people go to the polls in November, George Bush will
have a rendezvous with his own record.''
   The Democratic chairman noted that Bush was given responsibility
for a task force to stop drugs at the U.S. borders.
   ``Isn't it fair,'' Kirk said, ``for voters to ask of the person
entrusted with that special responsibility not only why are we
losing the war against drugs, but also ... how could you not have
known about drug thug Noriega dealing drugs and laundering money
and running guns?''
   Kirk also noted that in March 1986, Bush released the report of
the anti-terrorism task force, in which he said this country would
offer no concessions to terrorists. Just one week earlier, the
White House completed the first delivery of missiles to the
Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran.
   Bush has maintained that he had reservations about the
Iran-Contra dealings and was excluded from decision-making on the
matter.
   After Kirk's address, which anticipated the general election
campaign in the fall, state party leaders were reminded by Jesse
Jackson's campaign that the contest for the Democratic nomination
isn't over yet.
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, a Jackson supporter, said
Democrats can win the election in November only if they are unified
after leaving the convention. And that could depend on not writing
off Jackson too soon, he said.
   ``You don't have to be a professional politician to know that
this type of thinking will allow you to win the nomination and lose
the election,'' Rangel said.
   A somewhat different view came from Robert A. Farmer, treasurer
of front-runner Michael Dukakis' campaign:
   ``History suggests that where a party has been able to identify
a candidate early, he has a stronger chance of success in the
fall,'' he said. ``And I think we don't want to appear arrogant and
we don't want to appear cocky, but we're very pleased the way
things are going. And if we can ... identify the nominee early, I
think we can all begin to work together.''
   Outside the meeting room, there was scattered talk of a vice
presidential running mate for Dukakis.
   Georgia party chairman John Henry Anderson said he'd heard home
state Sen. Sam Nunn's name mentioned frequently. As proof, he
steered reporters to Alabama party chairman John Baker.
   Baker commented, ``I personally think that the best ticket from
the Alabama standpoint is the Dukakis-Nunn ticket. I think Dukakis
stands a chance to carry Alabama, maybe with some other people
(than Nunn), but I believe that would be by far the strongest
ticket.''
   Ohio chairman Jim Ruvolo said he is pushing Ohio Sen. John
Glenn, who sought the party's presidential nomination in 1984.
   ``We think Glenn balances the ticket in terms of his strength as
someone experienced in defense issues, foreign policy issues,
someone who's viewed as a moderate,'' he said. ``And certainly his
record on important issues like civil rights is right there in the
mainstream of the party.''

   Radical students on Friday scaled the
walls of the U.S. Embassy, tossed homemade bombs at its buildings
and shouted ``Yankee go home!'' in protests called to mark a bloody
demonstration eight years ago.
   Witnesses said two people were injured in the attack which broke
out shortly before noon. Seven attackers were arrested.
   U.S. Embassy officials said the bombs didn't damage the
buildings and no Americans were hurt.
   Witnesses said students, some of them armed with steel bars,
hurled six homemade bombs at police and over the embassy walls
topped with barbed wires.
   Four of the devices, made from crude chemical explosives packed
in soft drink cans, exploded with big bangs, sending about 100
people waiting for visa applications running for cover, witnesses
said.
   A police officer was hospitalized with blast wounds on his neck
and hands, they said. A student was also injured when he was hit by
a policeman armed with an iron bar.
   Five students carrying one South Korean and two U.S. flags
climbed over the 6-foot-high fence and ran around the embassy
compound for several minutes, scattering leaflets.
   One student draped a South Korean national flag over his
shoulder while other students tried to destroy two U.S. flags
before being overpowered by police, the witnesses said.
   The students also tried to unfurl a placard which read, ``Drive
out America, culprit of the Kwangju massacre,'' they said.
   The placard refered to an anti-government uprising in Kwangju on
May 18, 1980, during which hundreds were killed. Friday's protests
and others earlier this week were called to commemorate the
bloodshed in that southern city.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
the embassy incident lasted only about five minutes. Redman said
five policemen and one student were injured.
   He added, ``There's no excuse for this kind of behavior. There
is a political system now in Korea that provides for the expression
of political views and participation in the political process.''
   National police remained on full alert to cope with the
demonstrations.
   Radical groups called for another march in Seoul on Saturday to
denounce the government. Opposition church groups also called for
peaceful protests.
   In other parts of Seoul and two provincial cities, hundreds of
students staged demonstrations and marches, demanding the fall of
the government of President Roh Tae-woo and the withdrawal of
41,000 U.S. troops stationed here under a mutual defense treaty.
   Many of the protests were peaceful but some turned into battles
with riot police who retaliated with tear gas. In Kwangju, 400
students clashed with police, hurling firebombs and rocks.
   Eight students were arrested in Suwon, 25 miles south of Seoul,
when they stormed an office of the governing Democratic Justice
Party with firebombs and sticks. Riot police overpowered the
attackers.
   Protesters have denounced the United States in demonstrations
this week, charging that Washington supports military dictatorship
in South Korea.
   Demonstrators broke windows and hurled firebombs Thursday at the
Seoul office of the U.S. Information Service. The center was seized
by radicals in February who exploded several bombs that caused
minor damage.
   Radical groups call for the overthrow of the Roh government
which they consider a continuation of its predecessor ``military
dictatorship'' led by former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Roh is distrusted by many Koreans because of the role he played
in Chun's government. Roh narrowly won presidential elections in
December after two opposition candidates ran and split the
opposition ticket.
   On Friday, Roh's government and the opposition failed to break a
stalemate over clearing the way for talks between the president and
opposition leaders.
   Both sides have called for negotiations between the two camps
after last month's legislative elections in which the opposition
took control of the National Assembly.
   Officials of the rival parties have met several times during the
past week, but failed to work out details on opening the assembly.
   One major stumbling block has been Roh's plan to include the
head of his Democratic Justice Party in the summit with Kim
Dae-jung and the two other main opposition party leaders, Kim
Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil.
   The opposition leaders want only Roh to meet with the opposition
chiefs.
   Chun used to include the chairman of his ruling party in
summits, but opposition leaders, emboldened by their election
victory last month, now object to the idea.

   A truck lost its brakes and rammed a
restaurant Friday, injuring five people, including a policeman and
the owner of the restaurant.
   ``The officer told me he was just sitting at the counter and he
turned his head and saw the walls coming down and the cab of the
truck coming at him,'' said Detective Lt. John Ferraro.
   The truck was traveling down a slight incline in heavy rain at 6
a.m. when the brakes failed and the driver swerved to avoid other
vehicles.
   ``I looked to the front and saw the light pole, then saw nothing
more,'' the driver, Nelson Lopez, 22, of Springfield, said in a
police report. ``Next thing I knew I was inside the building.''
   The impact caved in the front wall of Frenchy's Restaurant.
   All of those injured, including Patrolman Kenneth Racine and
owner Gilbert Cote, had been eating breakfast, police said. The
crash apparently threw patrons into the counter and pinned Cote and
Racine.
   Racine, 37, managed to free himself and pull Cote and other
patrons from the wreckage, police said. Racine was treated for leg
injuries at a hospital and released.
   Cote, 43, was admitted to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield
with multiple injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Cote, known as ``Frenchy,'' was one of four Chicopee
restaurateurs to hand out vouchers to poor people for food at a
nearby food bank. He also was known for slipping free sandwiches to
those who looked like they couldn't afford them, customers said.
   One person was admitted to Mercy Hospital in Springfield in fair
condition. Two other people were treated at hospitals for minor
injuries and released.
   Lopez was cited by police for having defective equipment and for
not having a driver's license.

   U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II will formally
announce Saturday that he will run for re-election to the seat once
held by his late uncle John F. Kennedy and former House Speaker
Thomas P. O'Neill.
   The 35-year-old son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy enters
the 1988 race with a significant advantage over two years ago _ the
backing of 16 Democratic state representatives in his 8th
Congressional District.
   Kennedy won the seat in 1986 after surviving an 11-candidate
primary and spending a state record $1.8 million. That debt is now
retired and he faces no Democratic opposition this year, aide Jim
Mahoney said. Kennedy is expected to face a Republican opponent in
the fall.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide strike by journalists left Italians
without their Friday morning and evening news broadcasts and no
weekend newspapers.
   Journalists at the two major national news agencies AGI and ANSA
joined their colleagues at RAI state television and radio offices
as well as private broadcast disputes in the dispute.
   Newspapers won't appear Saturday or Sunday.
   The strikers have announced which days they will stay off the
job this month, with newspapers scheduled to appear on Monday
before disappearing again later that week for a few days before
resuming publication.
   The ``newsless'' days are the latest in a series of protests led
by the National Press Federation to protest a breakdown in talks
for a new contract.
   Italian publishers claim their labor costs would increase 70
percent in three years and that many newspapers would have to fold
if they met the union demands. The unions dispute the figures,
saying costs would rise 40 percent.
   Unions also want a clause that would prevent newspaper chains
from using one central newsroom to provide national and
international news for the group.

   The head of the NAACP said Friday that
if the fall presidential race is as close as he thinks it will be,
blacks could swing the election either way.
   ``Black participation could be awesome in terms of its effect on
the race,'' said Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``Based on what I've seen, this will be a very close race and 8
percent to 10 percent can be decisive,'' said Hooks. ``The black
vote will be large and it will be predominantly Democratic.''
   Still, Hooks said, blacks must not appear ``the captive of one
party. For if that becomes the fact, then we will be ignored by the
Democratic Party and overlooked by the other party and we become of
no consequence.''
   He said Democrat Jesse Jackson now appeared to have little
chance of becoming his party's presidential nominee, but added, ``I
think he'll be running for president for the next 20 years and
maybe one of these years he'll make it.''

   The U.N. Disaster Relief Organization and a U.S.
government assistance office will send 250 tons of emergency aid to
Ethiopia in case the number of displaced people increases, an U.N.
spokesman said Friday.
   The spokesman, Mohammad Khatib, said the aid, including tents,
blankets, kitchen utensils and building materials, would be sent to
Asmara on Wednesday.
   The U.N. organization is contributing 100 tons and the Office of
U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, part of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, is sending 150 tons, he said, adding
that the two agencies are cooperating to save costs.
   The equipment is being sent as a precautionary measure, to be
used if there is a mass displacement of people in northern Ethiopia
because of the food shortage there, Khatib said. The supplies could
help 150,000 people.
   Khatib said there are about 40,000 displaced people in the
north, but that they continue to move from place to place.
   He said officials wanted to avoid a repeat of the 1984-85
drought and famine, when many people left their villages and camped
out near food distribution centers.

<TEXT>
   Jurors in the case of Carlos Lehder
Rivas decided Friday that the government can confiscate millions of
dollars in real estate on a Bahamian island, as well as several
planes and other items owned by the convicted drug dealer.
   ``The island is wrecked. It is trashed. But that is not to say
it would not be of some future value,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle
said.
   The same jury had found the 38-year-old Colombian guilty on all
11 drug-trafficking counts Thursday after seven days of
deliberations. Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, was found guilty
on one count of conspiracy.
   The issue of property forfeiture has to be considered separately
under federal law.
   During Thursday's hearing on that, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst
Mueller urged the jurors to allow the government to confiscate a
large portion of Norman's Cay, an airstrip, a marina, three homes,
a condominium and several planes. The island was Lehder's smuggling
base from 1978 to 1980.
   ``If you prosecute a drug smuggler without taking his property,
only part of the job has been accomplished,'' said Mueller.
   According to Internal Revenue Service figures, Lehder earned an
estimated $250 million in the cocaine business.
   After 10 hours of deliberations the jury agreed Friday to all
the forfeitures. But the question of how the government could take
control of property in the Bahamas was not clear.
   Lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines when he is sentenced July 20. Reed faces a maximum of 15
years and $25,000 in fines.
   Lehder's attorney, Edward Shohat, told U.S. District Judge
Howell W. Melton after the jury was dismissed Friday that under the
U.S.-Colombia treaty in existence at the time of Lehder's
extradition, his client might face a maximum of only 30 years in
prison. Merkle disagreed, and the judge asked both sides to submit
briefs on the question.
   Meanwhile, Merkle refused again Friday to confirm reports that
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling _ who trial witnesses
said received million-dollar bribes from Lehder _ is his next
target.
   Pindling and his aides have denied taking bribes, but have said
they understand a Florida grand jury is investigating the matter.
   Merkle said he could not confirm the existence of such an
investigation.
   Although Lehder was only on trial for smuggling 3.3 tons of
cocaine from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas into deserted
airstrips in Florida and Georgia, the government presented
testimony that Lehder smuggled 18,000 kilos.
   Lehder has been identified as being one of the leaders of the
violent Medellin cartel, the Colombian organization also reputedly
headed by Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Jose
Rodriguez Gacha.
   The seven-month trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115
government witnesses, along with mounds of documents. Lehder was
extradited to the United States last year following a firefight and
his arrest by the Colombian army at a Medellin mansion.
   During the trial, Merkle called Lehder the Henry Ford of drug
trafficking, the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern,
high-tech operation, using airdrops and speed boats.
   Lehder also is under indictment in Miami for his role in the
cartel and a sealed indictment in Los Angeles, but officials said
it is unlikely that he can be tried for those offenses.

   The Democratic National Convention staff, trying
to plan for any disaster that might beset the gathering, listed
among its 179 bad-news scenarios the potential for Jesse Jackson's
supporters to block the entrance of a hotel.
   Disaster specialists reviewed the scenarios on Thursday with
administrative personnel from police, fire and medical teams
planning for the Atlanta convention.
   The Jackson scenario assumes that disgruntled Jackson delegates,
holding a ``Draft Jesse for President'' rally, might block the
entrance to a hotel in protest.
   Other scenarios included:
   _A water main breaks, leaving the Omni, site of the convention,
without water.
   _Five Missouri delegates report their credentials are stolen.
   About 35,000 people are expected for the July event, not a large
crowd by Atlanta convention standards. A computer conference
earlier this month drew twice that many.
   ``But we'll have the eyes of the world on us,'' said Ellis
Stanley, director of the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management
Agency. ``We've got to know where all the duties and
responsibilities will fall.''

<HEAD>Honored, Popular Gifted Teacher Told She Must Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman honored recently as the Bay Area
Gifted Teacher of the Year has been told by school officials she
must retire next month so the district can save money.
   ``I feel they are dishonoring the teacher of the year,'' said
Flossie Lewis, 63, a teacher for 37 years. ``I understand the
bureaucratic mentality. But what are we in education for? To treat
people like robots?''
   The San Francisco Unified School District has said Lewis must
retire, although a state law would allow her to continue with the
district's permission.
   Rod Hong, district personnel director, said the system has about
550 teachers over age 59 earning top pay. The system is seeking
their retirements to cut costs.
   Hong also noted that Lewis' five years are up on a statewide
reduced workload program that allows her to work half a year and
receive half her $40,000 salary, yet still get full retirement
benefits.
   Previous state law required teachers to retire after five years
in the program, but last year the law was changed to permit school
districts to extend the program to 10 years.
   Chris Karlen, executive director of the San Francisco Classroom
Teachers Association, said he asked officials to permit the
extension for Lewis, but they refused. However, schools
Superintendent Ramon Cortines indicated Wednesday the district
would be willing to negotiate.
   While most teachers use the reduced workload program as a way to
ease into retirement, Lewis, a published author of fiction, essays
and literary criticism, has started working on a doctorate in
English at the University of California at Berkeley.
   Hong said Friday he doesn't have a figure on how much money the
district would save if all the teachers eligible to resign or
participate in reduced workload program _ like Lewis _ did so. He
did say at least 25 teachers are in the reduced workload plan.
   Still, Hong said he will not make an exception for Lewis.
   ``It's not that we're trying to be mean or cruel to her,'' he
said. ``She's just one teacher. We have to treat all district
employees equally. She wants her cake, and she wants to be able to
eat it, too.''

<HEAD>Trial Of Suspected TWA Hijacker To Start On July 5</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged
with murder and air piracy in the 1985 TWA hijacking is expected to
go to trial in juvenile court in July, a court spokesman said
Friday.
   The Frankfurt trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi is expected to begin
July 5 and continue at least two months, said spokesman Falk Thomas.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987,
carrying liquid explosives and false documents. He was charged Feb.
8.
   The air piracy and murder charges are in connection with the
June 14, 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut, Lebanon, in
which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed. The hijackers held
39 Americans captive for 17 days.
   Hamadi was indicted in the United States on air piracy and
murder charges but West Germany refused to extradite him.
   Hamadi will be tried before a juvenile chamber of the Frankfurt
state court, although he could be treated as an adult and receive
the maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.
   The court will first try to determine if Hamadi was under 21
years old during the hijacking. He first told investigators he was
born June 13, 1964, but later said he was two years younger.
   Under West German law, juvenile courts can handle cases of
defendents under 21.
   A juvenile court can impose a life sentence on an adolescent
despite the age.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas, was found guilty by a Duesseldorf court
last month of organizing the kidnapping of two West Germans in
Lebanon to force the West German government to release his brother.
Abbas Hamadi was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   The two West Germans were abducted within a week of Mohammed
Hamadi's arrest. Alfred Schmidt was released in September. Rudolf
Cordes remains a hostage.

   The Soviet Union is about to get a taste
of Cajun-style diplomacy as chef John Folse carries his fiery
recipes abroad and artist George Rodrigue introduces a new audience
to his haunting portraits of Acadiana.
   The two left New Orleans on Friday for a 10-day trip to the

and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Seeds for the trip were planted in August, according to
Rodrigue, when a Soviet delegation of scientists and public
officials visited Folse's restaurant, Lafitte's Landing, in
Donaldsonville.
   It was, Rodrigue said, the delegation's first glimpse of rural
culture in America.
   ``This was not part of their typical American concept. We were
the people living off the land,'' the artist said in a telephone
interview as he prepared for his departure.
   The Soviets met Folse and sampled his food. ``I doubt the
Soviets ever ate a better meal,'' Folse said later.
   The Soviets also met Rodrigue and saw his art. ``I told them I
paint the people of the land,'' he said.
   Rodrigue's portraits of Acadians, often posed against the
backdrop of moss-draped oak trees on bayou shores, captured the
imagination of the Soviets.
   Soviet officials commissioned a Gorbachev portrait and Rodrigue
painted him in a yellow suit ``because yellow is a color of
peace.'' Gorbachev is depicted in front of the Kremlin, with a
bright sun shining and smaller figures of himself as a child,
standing with his parents, in the background.
   The Gorbachev portrait, and one of Reagan, will make the trip to
the Soviet Union, along with about 20 Rodrigue paintings depicting
Cajun life.
   ``I tried to pick things that were kind of universal, one is a
horse race, one is a story of a church in the aftermath of a
hurricane, one is of a dog, my dog ... one is my little boy with
the saying `Kiss me, I'm Cajun' on his T-shirt,'' said the artist.
   Rodrigue credits Folse with arranging the trip. Folse got help
from the Louisiana congressional delegation. Earlier this week, he
said he had raised more than half the $130,000 he needed to cover
the costs of food and expenses.
   He said, he won't keep any of the money, however.
   ``The Soviets will keep every nickel of revenue,'' he said. ``I
hope Reagan makes a better deal than I did.''
   Rodrigue said he hopes both world leaders will visit the
temporary Cajun restaurant, Lafitte's Landing East, where he and
Folse will display their artistry.
   ``We're pretty sure about Gorbachev (paying a visit to the
restaurant),'' Rodrigue said. ``The president, we don't know.''

   The nation's future Galileos and Einsteins
arrived Friday for the National Science Olympiad, testing
brainpower and ingenuity in events from egg dropping to rocket
firing.
   Delaware State College is playing host to nearly 1,300 junior
and senior high school students, representing 36 states, for the
competition Saturday. Winners receive scholarships, trophies,
medals and other awards.
   The competition, sponsored by the Army Reserve Officer Training
Corps, consists of 22 events for junior high students and 23 for
high school.
   The students have already competed at the local, state and
regional levels, said John C. Cairns, event coordinator and science
supervisor for the Delaware Department of Public Instruction.
   The competition involves chemistry and physics, and tests
student' laboratory skills and the application of scientific
principles.
   Among the events will be an egg drop, which will require
students to make a device to safely catch a raw egg dropped from a
given height. The smallest device that can keep the egg from
breaking will win the event. The purpose is to test students'
knowledge of physics and the strength of materials.
   The U.S. Forestry Service has flown in about 40 seedlings from
across the country for the tree identification competition.
   This is the fourth national contest, which is modeled on
competition begun in Delaware 12 years ago.
   The event became a nationwide competition after Cairns helped
the Macomb County Intermediate School District in Michigan put
together its own contest.
   Cairns and Gerard J. Putz, science consultant for the Michigan
district, were discussing a competition between the two states
during a science conference in Boston.
   ``We were talking about it in front of an Army recruiting booth
... and the Army guy said the Army was looking for something
hi-tech to associate its name with. It went national the following
year,'' Cairns said.

   A woman walked into a second-grade
classroom and opened fire with a handgun today, killing one child
and critically wounding five others before barricading herself in a
nearby home and shooting a young man, authorities said.
   The woman ``just walked into the classroom, went past the
teacher who was there, indicated the gun was real and began firing
at random,'' said Winnetka Police Chief Herbert Timm.
   The woman fled Hubbard Woods Elementary School and went to a
home several blocks away. A 22-year-old man was wounded when he
tried to wrestle a gun away from the woman, but he and four other
people in the house were able to escape, said Joe Sumner, director
of operations for police.
   The woman barricaded herself inside and rifle-toting SWAT team
members in flak jackets with black daubs below their eyes
surrounded the area in this affluent north Chicago suburb.
   ``It's extremely scary. She's just an ordinary citizen and she
went through and set all this up. She isn't exactly stable,'' said
Northbrook poice commander Randy Walters, who was assisting at the
barricade site.
   Sumner said a negotiating team was unable to establish contact
with the woman. No motive for the shootings was immediately known.
   Police recovered a .32-caliber handgun from the school bathroom
and the woman was believed to also have a .22-caliber gun and a
third, unidentified weapon, Sumner said.
   The woman was believed to have set fire earlier this morning to
another house in Winnetka where she worked as a housekeeper. A
woman and several children who lived in the house escaped from the
basement through a window, said Sgt. Michael Geier of the Wilmette
police, who was also assisting Winnetka police.
   Patrolman Gary Schultz said the woman had opened fire without
warning when she got to the school . The shooting ended around 11
a.m., Schultz said.
   Parents rushed to the school and gathered outside, many of them
weeping as they waited for word of their children. School officials
said they would keep remaining children in school until the end of
the day.
   Sumner said the woman barricaded inside the home used three
different names, one of which was Laurie Dann. The FBI has an
``investigative interest'' in a woman of the same name, said
spokesman Tom Wronski, but he declined to give further information.
   Police in Madison, Wis., said they had been in contact with
Winnetka police about a woman named Laurie Dann, and said they had
once arrested the 31-year-old woman.
   Four children were taken by ambulance to Evanston Hospital, and
two children and one adult were being treated at Highland Park
Hospital, officials said.
   ``We have two girls and two boys. They're all critical, between
the ages of 7 and 9,'' said Evanston Hospital spokeswoman Mary
Harris. ``Three are in the operating room and one is in the
emergency room.''
   Three of the children suffered chest wounds and a fourth
suffered a neck wound, Evanston Hospital officials said.
   One 8-year-old boy died at Highland Park Hospital, said hospital
spokeswoman Sue Masaracchia. One other boy and a 22-year-old man
were in critical condition, according to spokesman Mark Newton.
   Police cars were ``everywhere,'' said Anne Belmont, who lives
nearby. ``There've been fire trucks, ambulances.''
   The kindergarten through fifth-grade school is located in a
residential neighborhood, said Bobbi Eilers, a Winnetka resident.
The neighborhood is ``incredibly quiet ... a family neighborhood,''
Belmont said.

   A federal magistrate agreed Friday to grant bond to
a Colombian vice consul arrested for drugs here, but the suspect
will have to remain in jail pending a prosecution appeal of the
decision.
   Ernesto Delgado Salazar, 58, was arrested Feb. 11 for allegedly
agreeing to store cocaine at a ``stash'' house in Miami, as well as
import the drug. He has been held without bond in the Metropolitan
Correctional Center south of Miami.
   Delgado was vice consul in Miami until his arrest, and allegedly
used his office for some of the dealing.
   On Friday his former boss, Consul General Roberto Garcia, told
U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo he would ensure Delgado was not given
a passport to flee the United States.
   Delgado's attorney, Bonnie Phillips-del Corral, also introduced
a score of people at the hearing who, she said, would testify
Delgado is not a risk of flight.
   Palermo agreed to grant a $250,000 bond which Delgado's family
would sign for, but Assistant U.S. Attorney William Jung filed
notice of intent to appeal.
   Delgado must stay in jail until the appeal is decided. His
trial, which has been delayed twice, is set for July 18.

<HEAD>Clark Resigns After `Gallant' Attempt To Keep PTL Intact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL bankruptcy trustee David Clark
announced his resignation Friday after a ``gallant'' but
unsuccessful attempt to keep the scandal-tainted organization
intact.
   ``I came here in November to do all in my power to preserve and
reorganize the PTL ministry and Christian retreat,'' Clark said in
a letter Friday to U.S. Trustee John Waites, a justice department
official in Columbia who presides over bankruptcy cases.
   ``It is now clear that much of PTL must be sold to pay
creditors,'' Clark, 47, said. ``Although I have no desire to
preside over the sale of PTL assets, I maintain a strong commitment
to the survival of the ministry and I hope to be of assistance to
that end.''
   Clark's resignation was provided for in a revised reorganization
plan filed with the federal bankruptcy court Monday, but no time
was specified. The filing outlined plans to sell the Heritage USA
theme park in Fort Mill and lease the property required to carry on
its church and television ministry to a separate corporation.
   In the court filing, Clark had blamed the financial failure on a
drop in contributions after the ``various scandals'' and warned,
``Because of past scandals and credibility problems, PTL and other
television ministries are facing extinction.''
   If the new reorganization terms are approved by the bankruptcy
court, Clark would stay on as initial president of the non-profit
corporation, Heritage Ministries Inc., that would run the church
and cable television network. Later, a board of directors would
determine who would serve as permanent president.
   Clark had previously served as vice president of marketing at
the Christian Broadcasting Network.
   In addition to sending the letter to Waites, Clark announced his
resignation on the ``PTL Club'' TV show Friday and told viewers he
is taking a week's vacation. He did not indicate whether he would
continue as host of the show.
   Clark could not be reached for comment later Friday. His office
said he had gone for the day.
   He is the third television evangelist to resign as head of PTL
in 14 months. Jim Bakker, who founded PTL in 1974, resigned in
March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal and turned the ministry
over to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral Majority.
Falwell resigned in October 1987 amid disenchantment with his
leadership.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds approved Clark's
resignation and the appointment of M.C. Benton to succeed Clark as
trustee to manage the day-to-day operations of PTL, Waites said.
   Benton, former mayor of Winston-Salem, N.C., has served as PTL's
executive vice president for accounting and operational affairs
since Feb. 1.
   PTL, approximately $130 million in debt, filed for
reorganization and protection from creditors in bankruptcy court in
June 1987. The ministry's assets are valued at $160 million.
   ``Dr. Clark made a gallant effort to ensure the successful
reorganization of PTL,'' Waites said. ``Considering the problems
which preceded him at PTL, and the troubled times for television
ministries generally, the financial support of PTL during Clark's
tenure was impressive.''
   However, PTL failed to raise enough money to make the initial
payment of its debt as required under a reorganization plan filed
in December. A modified reorganization plan filed Monday called for
the trustee to liquidate the assets of PTL to the extent necessary
to pay creditors.
   Two parties interested in buying PTL are George Shinn, a sports
entrepreneur from Charlotte, N.C., who wants to build a
professional baseball and basketball complex; and Family
Entertainment America, a California-based corporation with links to
Bakker.
   FEA will make a bid by the end of next week to take over the
assets of PTL, according to various officials with the firm.
   Bakker told the Los Angeles Times, in a story published
Thursday, that FEA offers ``the best hope on the table at this
moment'' for him and his wife, Tammy, to return to PTL.
   However, FEA spokesman Kerry Moody said the organization has not
invited Bakker ``to come back in any capacity.''

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Calls for Slower Star Wars Deployment Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon should take a slower, more
measured approach to the deployment of a Star Wars anti-missile
defense system, a scientific advisory panel said in a report
released Friday.
   The panel, a special task force of the Defense Science Board,
said the administration's plan of setting up even an interim
``Phase 1'' system all at once is too ambitious.
   ``In view of the technical, budgetary, political and arms
control uncertainties surrounding the ballistic missile defense
program, the panel recommends planning a number of steps in the
technical development and deployment of a system ... rather than a
single major action,'' the report said.
   The task force suggested the Defense Department start by
deploying 100 ground-based interceptor rockets as allowed under the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, either outside Washington,
D.C., or at Grand Forks Air Force Base, N.D.
   The next step, it said, should be deployment of a new generation
of ``space surveillance systems to improve our early warning
detection and assessment of a ballistic missile attack ....''
   That could be followed by deployment of new, short-range
interceptor missiles around Washington, with the next phase
consisting of ``additional bases and ground-based interceptors and
improved sensors to cope with counter-measures.''
   Only then would a move be made to deploy defensive weapons in
space, the panel said, with the final step being the addition of
ground- or space-based lasers.
   ``This approach would allow for more confident decisions and
more flexibility in the face of uncertainties and would probably
not require any more time in the long run,'' the task force
contended.
   The science board task force was asked to take a fresh look at
the Star Wars program early this year by Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci. Its report was dated April 13 but was not cleared for
unclassified release until Friday.
   The Pentagon, in finally releasing the study, stressed the
findings were ``solely those of the authors and the submission of
the report to the secretary in no way signals a change in U.S.
policy with respect to the (Star Wars) program.''
   The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons
that could be deployed either in space or on the ground to
automatically shoot down enemy nuclear missiles.
   Last September, then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger
selected five Star Wars technologies for concentrated research,
saying they would form the heart of an initial Phase 1 system.
Among the five were some space-based as well as ground-based rocket
systems.
   Ever since then, the Pentagon has suggested the research results
involving all five technologies would be evaluated sometime in the
early 1990s and a decision made on constructing an initial system.
   ``We believe that the difficulty of supporting such a large
decision all at once and of bringing all system elements to a
satisfactory stage at the same time make the all-at-once plan very
risky,'' the task force said.
   ``The stepped plan allows much more confident decisions and much
more flexibility in the face of uncertainties.''
   The Pentagon also should consider giving the highest priority to
development ``of the sensors, processing and communications
necessary'' to detect a nuclear attack and track and target
incoming missiles, it said.
   Moreover, it said, the Defense Department and Congress must
resolve their dispute over what research the ABM Treaty allows.
``There is not a force acting on the SDI program that is more
damaging or more insidious ...,'' the 11-member group wrote.
   ``Because the Soviets exploit ambiguities to the limit, a U.S.
policy that restricts us to activities that are unambiguously
permitted by the treaty could seriously impair our security,'' the
panel said.
   ``We believe the Defense Department should define a technically
optimum testing and deployment program and should then adhere to
that program except when treaty constraints unambiguously require
it to do otherwise.''
   The assessment requested by Carlucci comes at a time when the
defense secretary has been studying changes to the Star Wars
research schedule caused by congressional budget cuts.
   Carlucci said earlier this month he would recommend a budget
veto if the Star Wars request of $4.55 billion in fiscal 1989 was
cut too deeply.

<HEAD>Soviets Accuse Pakistan of Violating Geneva Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry on Friday accused Pakistan of
shipping arms and military hardware to Afghan rebels and violating
the agreement under which Soviet soldiers are leaving Afghanistan.
   The official news agency Tass quoted ministry officials as
saying Pakistan was not living up to the April 14 Geneva agreement
that prohibits it from assisting Afghan anti-government forces.
   In a separate commentary, Tass criticized Pakistani Foreign
Minister Zain Noorani for allegedly inciting the rebels to military
action.
   According to Soviet media reports, the Afghan Foreign Ministry
has complained twice this week to U.N. observers that Pakistan is
helping arm the Afghan rebels.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry officials said ``the shipping of arms
and ammunition from Pakistan into the territory of the Republic of
Afghanistan is an obvious violation of the Geneva agreements which
entered into force on May 5,'' Tass reported.
   Terms of the Geneva agreement mean Pakistan ``should discontinue
the entire range of actions and activities to interfere in the
affairs of Afghanistan,'' it said.
   Pakistan has officially denied helping ship arms to the
guerrillas but Noorani said Thursday that his country will observe
the policy of ``symmetry,'' in which the guerrillas receive U.S.
aid as long as the Soviet Union arms the Marxist government.
   Soviet soldiers began withdrawing May 15 and the first convoy to
leave Afghanistan crossed the border Wednesday. According to the
agreement, all of the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers must be
withdrawn within nine months.
   A Soviet journalist indicated Thursday that between 12,000 and
15,000 Soviet soldiers had been killed in fighting since Soviet
troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979.
   In its commentary, Tass said Noorani promised Soviet officials
on a recent trip to Moscow that his country would abide by the
Geneva agreement, but said on his return home Thursday that
Pakistan will continue to help the United States aid the rebels.
   commentator Valery Vavilov said.
   The Afghan peace process requires strict observance of all its
terms, and ``any deviations, and `free' and `broad' interpretations
of separate articles and clauses of the accords are intolerable,''
said commentator Valery Vavilov said.
   He quoted Western press reports as saying unprecedented arms
shipments were en route to the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan,
where the Afghan insurgents have their bases.

   G. William Cox, who resigned as managing editor
of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin in 1986 after revealing he was
suffering from AIDS, died Friday at his home in Manhattan Beach,
Calif. He was 39.
   Cox resigned from the Star-Bulletin on Sept. 2, 1986, saying he
was unable to continue working because he was suffering from
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
   ``As a journalist, I have spent my career trying to shed light
in dark corners,'' he wrote in revealing his illness in an
editorial page article on the day of his resignation. ``AIDS is
surely one of our darkest corners. It can use some light.
   ``By writing about AIDS, I am following a tradition of
journalists who have written about their illnesses to help educate
and, if blessed by finding the right words, to help others with the
disease feel less alone,'' he wrote.
   ``Most of all, I am writing to say if we don't want to be
treated as a pariah, we have to stop acting like one,'' he said.
   During his tenure at the Star-Bulletin, Cox fought for
reporters' access to government records and meetings so they could
keep the public informed.
   He served as president of the Hawaii chapter of Sigma Delta Chi,
the Society of Professional Journalists, and as chairman of its
Freedom of Information Committee.
   Cox joined the Star-Bulletin in January 1984 after serving five
years as city editor of The Courier-Journal in Louisvlle, Ky. He
was a 1971 graduate of the University of Missouri School of
Journalism.
   He is survived by his parents, Homer and Ann Cox of Louisville.
   Services will be held in Louisville.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Approving Radioactive Waste Compact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed federal legislation
Thursday approving the Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Compact but warned the compact commission against attempting
to enforce federal laws.
   In a statement announcing his signature, Reagan said more than
three quarters of the states have now entered compacts on low-level
radioactive waste.
   He said such actions ``underscore this nation's commitment to
take those actions needed to ensure the future availability of
nuclear power as an energy supply option for this country.''
   Reagan objected, however, to a provision of the bill assigning
federal law enforcement responsibility to the commission without
requiring that commissioners be appointed consistently with the
appointments clause of the Constitution.
   ``Any effort by the commission to enforce federal regulations
would contravene the Constitution,'' the president said.
   ``While I hope that no such effort would occur, I expect the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take note of and report to the
attorney general on any such actions of the commission in this
area.''
   Under the compact _ which includes Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Delaware and Maryland _ the four states are required to ensure that
there is a regional facility sufficient to dispose of the region's
low-level waste, and that each state has equal access to it.
   The commission created under the compact is empowered to set
regulations on waste disposal and to impose fines or other
penalties for violations.
   During consideration of the bill, the Justice Department told
Congress that this part of the bill was unconstitutional because it
applied to federal as well as state regulations.
   The department said enforcing federal regulations pursuant to a
congressionally approved interstate compact constitutes the
exercise of ``significant authority pursuant to the laws of the
United States.''
   In order to do this, the department said, the compact members
would have to be appointed by the president or by other federal
authorities designated by Congress, as provided in the Constitution.
   Instead, the commission members are appointed by the states.
   In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the governors of
the compact states said they did not believe a constitutional issue
would arise because ``the compact was never intended to apply to
activities over which the federal government has exclusive
jurisdiction.''

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said
Friday the Soviet Union has agreed to join an international peace
conference on the Middle East and reiterated his belief that peace
would come to Israel.
   However, Peres, who returned home from a 13-day trip, said many
problems remained with the Soviet Union.
   Also Friday, Israel radio reported that President Chaim Herzog
commuted the sentences of three Jewish underground members from
life in prison to 15 years for staging a deadly gun and grenade
attack at Hebron Islamic College in 1983.
   Three Palestinians were killed and 33 were wounded in the attack.
   The three convicted men _ Menachem Livni, Shaul Nir and Uzi
Sharbaf _ were among 25 Jews arrested in 1984 and charged with
planning or carrying out attacks against Arab targets.
   In other developments:
   _Israeli troops shot and wounded a 15-year-old Palestinian
during a demonstration in Jabaliya refugee camp, officials at Shifa
hospital in Gaza City said. The youth was shot in the hand after
protesters threw stones at Israeli troops.
   _The army command said a border policemen was slightly injured
by a knife-wielding Palestinian woman in Nablus in the West Bank.
   _The army confirmed that 1,770 Palestinians are being held in
administrative detention but the chief military attorney, Brig.
Gen. Amnon Shtresnov, denied the arrests without trial were a
violation of human rights.
   During his trip, Peres visited Hungary; Spain, where he attended
the Socialist International, and the United States.
   He met with key Soviet officials in Madrid and Washington,
including Moscow's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dubinin.
   In an interview at Ben Gurion International Airport, Peres told
The Associated Press the Soviets agreed to an international peace
conference which would not have the power to impose an agreement on
the parties.
   However, he said, ``the argument with the Soviet Union has not
reached a conclusion.''
   One major disagreement concerns Moscow's insistence on the right
of the Palestinians to self-determination. Both Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and Peres reject establishment of an independent
Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Peres told a group of supporters at the airport that Israel
would always insist on three points: defensible borders; refusal to
talk to the PLO and refusal to give up all of the territories
occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
   He said that during his travels, he tried to improve Israel's
image abroad.
   ``Our situation is very difficult, especially with the Socialist
International and the European Economic Community,'' Peres said.
``I tried to present a balanced picture of Israel in front of the
world.''
   An Arab uprising broke out in the occupied territories on Dec.
8, and Israel's strong measures to quash the insurrection drew
world criticism.
   Shtresnov said on Israel television in reporting on the
detainment of Palestinians that the army closely examined each
suspect before making the arrest and gave detainees the right to
appeal. He said the detentions ``are in accordance with Israeli and
international law.''
   He denied charges that the military justice system had collapsed
under the weight of the mass arrests which took place after the
uprising began.
   Shtresnov conceded that there were problems initially in
locating and identifying detainees, but said these were quickly
solved and that computers were now being used to keep track of
jailed Palestinians.
   Lea Zemel, an Israeli lawyer who represents Palestinian
prisoners, described the situation as ``a big mess.''
   According to estimates by left-wing legislator Deddi Zucker,
8,100 Palestinans are in jail after trial or pending trial, in
addition to 1,900 other detainees.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez
bruised four ribs in a car accident, but the Colombian-born writer
is recovering nicely in a Caracas clinic, the newspaper El Diario
de Caracas reported Thursday.
   ``By a hair I didn't stay forever in Venezuela _ can you
imagine?'' Garcia Marquez joked in an interview, the newspaper said.
   The writer, winner of the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature, was
injured Saturday in a collision between a bus and the car in which
he was riding. He was being driven to Maiquetia International
Airport outside Caracas, where he expected to take a plane to Cuba.
   Initial press reports said Garcia bruised one rib.
   Garcia was in Venezuela to research the life of South American
liberator Simon Bolivar (1783-1830) for a novel, tentatively titled
``The General in His Labyrinth.''
   His latest novel, ``Love in the Time of Cholera,'' was recently
released in an English translation.

<HEAD>US and Panamanian Negotiators Agree on a Noriega Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Panamanian negotiators have
tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to leave Panama next August and stay away until May 1989
and gives him a role in setting up a transition government
beforehand, an administration official said Friday.
   In return for Noriega's departure, the United States would agree
to drop federal drug smuggling indictments against him, said the
official, who has followed the negotiations but insisted on
anonymity.
   The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments,
allows Noriega to return to Panama for holidays and to go back
permanently after presidential elections set for May 1989, said the
official, who described himself as opposed to the arrangement.
   He said Vice President George Bush has expressed reservations.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said Friday that the vice
president Bush opposes negotiating with Noriega over the conditions
under which Noriega might surrender power.
   ``The administration sources who have suggested that the vice
president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy
back to Washington are essentially correct,'' Fuller said.
   Bush had lunch with President Reagan Friday, but the vice
president's aides would not say whether they discussed the Noriega
negotiations.
   The official who discussed the tentative deal also said Bush has
recommended that the State Department recall deputy assistant
secretary Michael G. Kozak from Panama. Kozak has spent virtually
all of May in Panama trying to work out an agreement.
   The official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an
Associated Press reporter said, ``If it gets accepted, it gives
Noriega everything he wants.''
   The official said there were no assurances that Noriega was
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the
defense chief has no intention of resigning his post, as the
agreement specifies.
   If the deal receives final approval, the official said Noriega
would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of
authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the
transition government.
   Late Friday, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Kozak was returning to Washington for consulations.
   He said Kozak's return does not mean any change in the process.
   ``The process continues,'' Redman said, declining further
comment.
   Associates of Noriega have said in recent weeks that Noriega
sees Aug. 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the
fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Defense
Forces.

   The staccato beat of a samba band
sounded in front of City Hall on Friday as this old Southern port
unveiled the 12th edition of its Spoleto Festival U.S.A. arts
showcase.
   About 1,000 people looked on as schoolchildren sent dozens of
colored balloons lofting into a pale blue sky.
   Then the musicians, in white slacks and metallic silver shirts,
played a variety of drums and tambourines as they spun and danced
on a platform stage.
   An hour later, the strains of a chamber music concert sounded at
the nearby Dock Street Theater, the first of dozens of performances
indoors and out throughout Charleston over 17 days.
   The festival was founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti and is
named after the similar festival he founded in Spoleto, Italy.
   Friday's opening ceremonies also kicked off four days of events
celebrating the bicentennial of South Carolina's ratification of
the Constitution.
   Charles Way Jr., the chairman of the Spoleto board, noted people
sometimes take the Constitution for granted and, in the same way,
he would like to see the day when folks take the festival for
granted.
   ``Right now, after 12 years, we are still a very fragile
organization. We're still a fragile dream that becomes a reality
for 17 marvelous days,'' he said.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. called the festival
Charleston's ``great contribution to the nation and the world,''
adding ``we make this gift proudly and happily.''
   But he said the festival ``is not given to this city. It is
earned. And each year we must strive to earn it anew.''
   During the course of the festival there will be 700 performances
by 2,000 performers, including productions staged in Piccolo
Spoleto, the city's companion arts festival, Riley said.
   Alex Sanders Jr., the chief judge of the South Carolina Court of
Appeals, spoke briefly about the Constitution, saying that when the
American experiment is measured against the ideals of its framers,
it may have fallen short.
   ``But when you measure the United States against the other
nations of the world, one cannot but be amazed at how well it has
worked,'' he said.
   The samba band was part of the cast of ``The Warrior Ant,'' a
work by director Lee Bruer and composer Bob Telson which features
over 50 dancers, musicians and actors and which will have its
premiere during Spoleto.
   The festival's major opera, Dvorak's ``Rusalka,'' which is
seldom performed in this country, was to open Friday evening.
   Menotti said later he feels the Spoleto production, splashed
with special effects, will be well received.
   ``It is beautiful work, very melodic ... the story has magic,''
he said. ``It is done very simply like a Japanese play. I think
people will come from all over the country to see our production.''
   Festival General Manager Nigel Redden said that over $1 million
in tickets had been sold by the opening of the festival. The
festival has a $3.7 million budget and about half that total is
generated through earned income, he said.

<HEAD>Call for Boycott of `24 Horas' News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A citizens' group is calling for a boycott of
the major news program in Mexico, accusing it of dedicating 97
percent of its time the presidential candidate of the governing
party.
   The Active and Peaceful Civic Resistance organization
distributed handbills calling on the public to stop watching 24
Horas, the nationally broadcast news program of the private
Televisa network.
   It said news of candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari dominated
the broadcasts.
   ``The public has a right to choose with its preference or
rejection of the type of information that it wants to receive,''
the handbills say.
   ``Let the public make it's decision and maintain it until it can
be proven that these news shows have stopped being instruments of
one party and have become true outlets of objective information,''
the handbills conclude.
   No one was immediately available at Televisa offices to comment
on the boycott call.
   Salinas deGortari, candidate of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party known as the PRI, is certain to win the July 6
elections over five minority party candidates.
   Rodolfo Bermejo, who identified himself as Civic Resistance's
training director, said in a phone interview Friday that the group
is an independent non-partisan organization in 29 Mexican cities.
   He said it formed in 1986 after controversial elections in the
northern border state of Chihuahua, won by the PRI and considered a
major setback to the opposition National Action Party.
   Televisa reorganized its news programs in response to numerous
complaints of biased coverage in the Chihuahua elections, adding an
evening news program that it said would emphasize provincial
coverage and add additional viewpoints.
   Minority candidates have complained frequently that they are
prevented from equal access to broadcast media and newspapers but
President Miguel de la Madrid and other PRI and government leaders
reject the accusation.
   Civic Resistance did not explain how it arrived at the figure of
97 percent of 24 Horas' programming being dedicated to Salinas de
Gortari.
   A study done by the government's Channel 11 found that 24 Horas
in February dedicated 67 bites, or 86 percent, of its campaign
coverage to Salinas de Gortari, said Raul Trejo, a researcher at
the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
   In an interview in this week's Mexico Journal magazine, Trejo
attributed the heavy coverage to ``the political ties that exist
between the heads of this communications enterprise and the PRI and
the insistence by the party that Televisa provide coverage of the
PRI candidate.''

<HEAD>DOT Probing Plans by Boston Airport to Sharply Boost Landing Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department, concerned about
local officials interfering in the free flow of air travel,
announced an investigation Friday into plans to sharply increase
landing fees for small aircraft at Boston's Logan International
Airport.
   Private pilots and some commuter airlines have complained loudly
that the higher fees will amount to them being driven from Boston's
major airport.
   At the same time, Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley asked the
operators of Logan to hold off on the landing fee increases, which
are to go into effect July 1, until the department's investigation
has been concluded next November.
   Despite the federal urging, officials of the Massachusetts Port
Authority, the state agency that runs the airport, said they plan
to go ahead with the higher landing fees as scheduled.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to delay (the fee increase),''
David Davies, executive director of Massport, said in a telephone
interview.
   A spokesman for Massport, Thomas Champion, said the higher fee
structure remains ``an essential first step in our overall program
to improve service at Logan for all New England travelers. It
should be implemented without delay and we're committed to a July 1
startup date.''
   The Transportation Department in a statement called the Massport
decision to proceed with the higher fees ``disppointing'' but said
it is ``premature to speculate whether the new fee schedule will
actually go into effect.''
   The plan calls for base landing fees to be increased from $25 to
nearly $100 with an additional charge pegged to the weight of the
aircraft. This would sharply increase the fees required from
operators of small, personal planes, business aircraft and
commuters, while the costs to the major airlines in some cases
would decline, critics complain.
   Burnley has been under intense pressure in recent months from
groups representing private pilots and commuter airlines as well as
some members of Congress to intervene in the Massport issue, which
is seen as a maneuver by the airport's operators to drive away all
but the scheduled airlines.
   Officials at crowded airports around the country are known to be
closely watching the Massport case and what actions the federal
government might take.
   Legislation designed to prevent the Logan plan from being
implemented has been introduced in Congress, but its chances for
passage seem slight this year.
   ``This is just the first foot over the line,'' Rep. Sherwood
Boehler, R-N.Y., said recently of the Massport proposal. ``There
are airports all over the country sort of foaming at the mouth,
just waiting to follow suit.''
   The Transportation Department said its investigation
specifically would examine complaints received about the higher
fees at Logan from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the
National Business Aircraft Association and the Regional Airlines
Association.
   These complaints indicate that ``reasonable grounds exist to
investigate whether Massport's action violates'' federal aviation
laws, the department said. Burnley said he would decide whether
further action is necessary after the report is received sometime
before Nov. 15.
   In a letter to Massport officials, Burnley urged that the new
landing fee structure not be implemented until the federal
investigation is completed because of ``the potential impact'' and
because the complaints about the fees ``raise questions involving
national transportation policy.''
   Davis said he was perplexed by the DOT request because a federal
court in Boston had already agreed to consider expeditiously a suit
challenging the higher fees with hopes of a ruling before they are
imposed. The court case is expected to give the issue a full
review, he suggested.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Allows Force-Feeding Of Hunger Striker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cuban prisoner who lost 21{ pounds
while fasting for three weeks to protest his possible deportation
is being force-fed, officials said.
   Esteban Manzo-Mart ``offered no resistance,'' said Brian Ross, a
spokesman for the Talladega federal correctional institution.
``He's being fed liquids intravenously.''
   The feeding began Thursday following an order that day by U.S.
District Judge James H. Hancock at Birmingham.
   Hancock acted after the chief of health programs at the
hospital, Dr. Roger Stanmore, said Manzo-Mart was ``increasingly
dehydrated, and was experiencing progressive decline in his blood
pressure.'' The doctor said the prisoner showed ``every sign of
approaching a life-threatening situation.''
   Manzo-Mart was one of 14 Cubans served with deportation papers
at Talladega April 29. He began the hunger strike two days earlier
and was joined by another Cuban prisoner, although the second man
later halted his fast.
   Manzo-Mart has appealed his deportation.
   Ten other Cubans have been served with deportation papers since
Manzo-Mart and the others were notified last month.
   Ross said there are 77 Cuban detainees at Talladega, all of whom
were in prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., when rioting over
deportation orders began last November.

   The State Department view is that dropping the indictments
against Noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in Panama.
   It contends that if Noriega's price for leaving Panama is
dismissal of the indictments, this would be a low cost way of
resolving the 12-week old crisis, which has dropped U.S.-Panamanian
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in Panama.
   According to a published report earlier this week, the United
States would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once
Noriega returns to Panama.
   The Reagan administration has been calling on Noriega to step
down since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega on Feb. 25
but was ousted himself the following day by the pro-Noriega
National Assembly. The United States continues to recognize
Delvalle as the legitimate authority in Panama.
   A series of U.S. economic sanctions have contributed to Panama's
economic demise.
   U.S. apprehensions about Noriega were heightened on Thursday
when a pro-government newspaper published photographs of U.S.
Embassy employees and their families so that Panamanians will
``know the Gringos who are starving us to death.''
   The supplement in the newspaper Critica, a propaganda organ of
the government, said the Americans ``think the walls of their
embassy are impregnable.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the supplement
has been ``noted with concern'' and that appropriate security
measures have been taken.
   He declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any
Americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated.
   ``We have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in
Panama,'' Redman said. ``This appears to be part of that. The way
to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need
to be taken.''
   Redman had no comment on the negotiations. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater also refused comment except to say they were
continuing.

   Marion G. Romney, president of the Mormon
Church's Council of the Twelve Apostles and a developer of the
faith's extensive welfare program, died Friday at age 90.
   Next in line by tradition to become president of the 6.5
million-member church, Romney died at his home of causes related to
his age, said church spokesman Don LeFevre.
   ``The major missions of the church will forever reflect the
kindliness, wisdom, gospel scholarship and faith of President
Marion G. Romney,'' said a joint statement issued by the church's
governing First Presidency.
   Romney's funeral was scheduled for noon Monday in the Tabernacle
on Temple Square.
   As the most senior member of the Twelve, Romney, by tradition,
was the likely successor to the presidency of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints had he outlived President Ezra Taft
Benson, the former U.S. agriculture secretary.
   However, because of failing health, Romney stopped participating
actively in church affairs well before Benson, 88, became church
president in November 1985.
   With Romney's death, Howard W. Hunter, acting president of the
Twelve for more than a year, becomes the group's official leader
and probable successor to Benson. Church presidents serve for life.
   Among Romney's achievements was creation, as a Salt Lake City
leader, of a prototype for the church's welfare system, organized
in 1936 to combat the impact of the Great Depression.
   The system, a network of farms, canneries and bakeries that
provide employment and goods for needy church members, is based on
a philosophy of self-help that has drawn praise from President
Reagan. Recipients are required to work at one of the enterprises
or perform some other service in return for assistance.
   After Romney was called to general leadership in the church in
April 1941 as an assistant to the Council of the Twelve, he was
named assistant managing director of the church welfare program, a
position he held until 1959. He served as general chairman of the
welfare committee from 1959 to 1963.
   He also was named in October 1951 to the Twelve, which assists
the three-member First Presidency. He became a member of the First
Presidency in 1972.
   ``He was a man of great warmth, love, kindness and patience,''
said Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter, a former Mormon stake president.
   Former Gov. Scott M. Matheson, Romney's cousin, recalled ``a
long and very gratifying association with him. He has been a great
inspiration to me.''
   Romney also was a cousin to George Romney, the former governor
of Michigan and candidate for the Republican nomination for
president in 1968.
   During his career, Romney supervised missionary efforts of the
church in Mexico, Europe, South Africa and Asia. In 1961, he
formally organized in Mexico City the church's first
Spanish-speaking stake, a geographical unit comprised of several
congregations.
   Romney had been a counselor to the late church Presidents Harold
B. Lee and Spencer W. Kimball between 1972 and 1985. When Kimball
died at age 90 on Nov. 5, 1985, Benson, his successor, replaced
Romney on the First Presidency and Romney became president of the
Twelve by seniority.
   Romney was born Sept. 19, 1897, in Colonia Juarez, Mexico, where
many Mormon families had settled after the church dropped its
doctrinally based practice of polygamy in 1890.
   Romney and his family were forced out of Mexico by
revolutionaries when he was 14. They eventually settled in Idaho.
   After serving in the U.S. Army in 1918, Romney graduated in 1920
from Ricks Normal College in Rexburg, Idaho. He served three years
as a missionary in Australia before enrolling at the University of
Utah, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1926 and, later, a law
degree.
   Romney is survived by two sons and eight grandchildren. His
wife, Ida Jensen Romney, died March 9, 1979.

   Delegates from the all-Swiss International
Committee of the Red Cross will begin visiting political prisoners
in Cuban jails in early June, a spokesman said Friday.
   The visits are the result of an agreement concluded in April
during a visit to Cuba by the group's president, Cornelio
Sommaruga, who met with President Fidel Castro, said Carlos
Bauverd, an ICRC spokesman.
   The four-delegate team will visit prisoners ``according to
standard ICRC procedures,'' meaning without witnesses present,
Bauverd said.
   Details of the visits, including the starting date, how many
prisoners would be registered and which prisons would be visited,
have yet to be worked out and will be announced later, he said.

<HEAD>State Says No Tiny Cubicles at Martinique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials said Friday they found no
evidence that rooms in a welfare hotel had been divided into ``tiny
cubicles,'' and said it was acceptable for two families to share a
bathroom.
   Social Services Commissioner Cesar Perales rejected charges by
the Legal Aid Society of illegal and substandard conditions at the
Martinique Hotel in Manhattan. But a Legal Aid lawyer said Perales
was wrong and pledged a lawsuit.
   ``To call a room that's 9-by-12 not a cubicle is no consolation
to a family living in it,'' said the lawyer, Steven Banks.
   ``State regulations require that rooms in which homeless
families are placed contain private bathrooms,'' Banks said. ``Even
the commissioner conceded today that these rooms do not have
private bathrooms.''
   Perales ordered an investigation after Banks charged this week
that as many as 80 rooms at the Martinique had been subdivided into
9-by-12-foot cubicles and lacked sufficient furniture.
   City officials and a hotel co-owner said some two-room suites
used in the past by one large family had been split up for two
smaller families, and that bathrooms were shared legally. Perales
said the same Friday.
   ``We observed no evidence of new construction or of rooms being
divided into tiny cubicles, and we observed no evidence of major
infestations of roaches or rats.''
   While some suites were split, with bathrooms shared, ``each
family has a private entrance,'' Perales said. ``Each bathroom can
be locked on both sides to ensure total privacy.''
   Banks said the issue was not new construction and he had not
alleged rat or roach infestations, but that families were being
crammed into small rooms and forced to share bathrooms.
   The city houses 5,189 homeless families, of which 3,437 are in
hotels and the rest in shelters. It recently announced a plan in
which it hopes to have homeless families out of all welfare hotels
in five years.

<HEAD>Fed Policymakers Opted for Higher Interest Rates in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top policymakers at the Federal Reserve,
worried about growing inflationary pressures, decided in late March
to push interest rates slightly higher, according to a record of
the discussions released Friday.
   The minutes of the March 29 meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee said the credit tightening was approved on a 10-1 vote,
with board member Martha Seeger voting no.
   The minutes said Ms. Seeger objected to the tightening because
she did not see a significant risk of higher inflation. It said she
remained concerned that higher interest rates could have an adverse
impact on economic growth, jittery financial markets and
financially troubled banks.
   The minutes were the first official confirmation of the Fed's
move to tighten interest rates in early April. The move was noted
at the time by economists, who said they also believe the Fed
tightened once again earlier this month.
   The closely watched federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other to make overnight loans, has moved higher and
averaged 7.04 percent in the past week, the highest it has been
since last October.
   A move by the Fed to lower the amount of money the banking
system has available shows up first in an increase in the federal
funds rate. With their own cost of money rising, banks are forced
to hike the interest rates they charge their customers.
   After the second round of credit tightening by the Fed, major
banks last week raised their prime lending rate from 8.5 percent to
9 percent, the first hike in this benchmark lending rate since
before the October stock market collapse.
   The committee met again Tuesday and many analysts believe it
left credit conditions unchanged, deciding to wait and see whether
inflationary pressures continue building.
   Many economists believe the Fed will be forced to act again with
another round of credit tightening, possibly as early as next
month. Because of this belief, they are forecasting that various
interest rates, including mortgage rates, will be headed higher in
the months ahead.
   In the minutes of the March meeting, Fed policymakers noted that
economic growth had been much stronger than was being predicted
right after the Oct. 19 stock market plunge. They noted that U.S.
factories were operating at the fastest pace in eight years while
unemployment was dropping to the lowest levels of this decade.
   Several of the participants cited these developments as evidence
that the Fed needed to boost interest rates to ``prevent the
business expansion from gathering excessive and unsustainable
momentum that would lead to higher inflation. ... Moreover, action
at this time might preclude the need for more substantial
tightening later.''
   At another point, the minutes said, ``The economy might well be
near the point where faster growth in business activity would
induce a higher rate of inflation, and in the view of several
members there was a potential for a sharp escalation in prices.''
   The Federal Open Market Committee is made up of six members of
the Federal Reserve Board and six of the 12 Fed regional bank
presidents, who serve on a rotating basis. There is currently one
vacancy on the panel.
   The minutes of Tuesday's meeting will not be released until
after the next strategy session is held on July 6-7.

<TEXT>
   A woman carrying at least two handguns
opened fire in an elementary school Friday, killing one child and
critically wounding five others. She then fled to a nearby home and
shot a seventh person, police said.
   ``There was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked
over'' as the children panicked and attempted to flee or hid under
desks, said Glencoe Patrolman John Ceglieski.
   Police believe the woman had set fire earlier in the day to
another home eight blocks away where she worked as a housekeeper in
this affluent North Shore suburb of Chicago, according to Sgt.
Michael Geier of the Wilmette police. He was assisting in the arson
investigation.
   Joe Sumner, director of operations for Winnetka police,
identified the woman as Lori Dann, 30. The FBI said it had ``an
investigative interest'' in her and Madison, Wis., Police Lt.
William Sprague said she had been arrested there March 14 on a
charge of retail theft. He gave no further details.
   More than five hours after the initial shooting, the woman
remained barricaded inside the home along a tree-lined
neighborhood. Heavily armed police encircled the dwelling and a
hostage-negotiating team was on the scene, but had not established
contact with the woman.
   ``It's extremely scary. She's just an ordinary citizen and she
went through and set all this up. She isn't exactly stable,'' said
Northbrook Police Commander Randy Walters, who was assisting local
police at the barricade site.
   ``The idea is to go in and take custody, not to kill her,'' he
said. ``If you go storming in, there's going to be a gunfight and
somebody might get shot _either her or one of our officers.''
   Winnetka Police Chief Herbert Timm said the woman walked into
the one-story, red-brick Hubbard Woods Elementary School, shot one
boy in a bathroom, then entered a second-grade class, ``went past
the teacher who was there, indicated the gun was real and began
firing at random.''
   Police recovered a .32-caliber handgun from the school bathroom
and the woman was believed to also have carried a .22-caliber gun
and a third, unidentified weapon, according to Sumner.
   Sumner said the woman then ran through the woods from the school
and entered the home, where four members of a family and their maid
were present.
   ``Apparently, she just walked in and confronted the
homeowners,'' Sumner said. ``The mother came running out and said,
`There's a woman in my home with a gun.'
   ``Then we heard a shot. The son came out, holding a gun, and
fell over in the driveway,'' Sumner said.
   The son apparently struggled with the suspect, grabbed one of
her weapons, and was shot in the chest, Sumner said.
   The father, maid and grandfather fled by side door, leaving the
suspect alone inside, Sumner said.
   He said he believed the woman had three weapons and police had
recovered two of them.
   Geier said the suspect was believed to have set fire to the home
where she worked while a mother and her children were in the
basement doing laundry.
   ``This woman set a fire in the house, trapping the people in the
basement,'' he said. ``They escaped, got out, apparently without
serious injury.''
   The shooting erupted at about 10:45 a.m. CST and police said it
lasted 15 minutes.
   An 8-year-old boy died at Highland Park Hospital, said
spokeswoman Sue Masaracchia.
   Another 8-year-old boy and the 22-year-old man shot at his home
were in critical condition at the hospital, she said.
   The four children at Evanston Hospital were reported in critical
but stable condition with gunshot wounds following surgery, said
spokeswoman Mary Ash.
   They were identified as Mark Teborek, 8, who suffered a gunshot
wound to the neck; Lindsay Clark-Fisher, 8, wounded in the chest
and stomach; Kathryn Ann Miller, wounded in the wrist and chest;
and Robert Trossman, 6, wounded in the chest.
   At the school, meanwhile, parents clustered in groups, consoling
each other and attempting to make sense of the incident.
   ``I ran here all the way from downtown (Winnetka),'' said
Benjamin Randall, waiting outside the school later Thursday for his
son to be released.
   ``I guess we're all vulnerable,'' he added. ``It' a sad
commentary on society.''
   Village Manager Robert Buechner said children were released in
small groups throughout the afternoon to ensure their safety.
   ``We're trying to keep the children calm and safely inside. We
will release them, but not until it's entirely safe to do so,''
said Buechner.

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy allegedly beaten by his father
while an emergency dispatcher listened was taken into protective
custody by child welfare officials who earlier decided to let him
stay with his family.
   Police on Thursday criticized the Harris County Children's
Protective Services' decision to let the boy go home despite a
tape-recording rescue officials had of the alleged attack.
   Hours later, the boy was taken into protective custody.
   An emergency dispatcher received a telephone call May 12 from
the boy, who thought his father was having a heart attack. But the
dispatcher soon heard the boy crying out and being beaten, police
said.
   Calls to the 911 emergency line routinely are recorded.
   The boy's father, John Thomas Whiddon, 40, has been charged with
felony injury to a child and is free on bond. The boy was not
seriously injured.
   After authorities went to the home where the call was made, the
boy was taken away. But hours later, he was returned to his family,
Children's Protective Services' officials said.
   The boy's initial return to his father came after a worker
determined he would not be in a ``life-threatening situation,''
spokeswoman Judy Hay said. The worker did not listen to the
recording before making the decision, she said.

   U.S. and Panamanian negotiators have
tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to leave Panama next August and stay away until May 1989
and gives him a role in setting up a transition government
beforehand, an administration official said Friday.
   In return for Noriega's departure, the United States would agree
to drop federal drug smuggling indictments against him, said the
official, who has followed the negotiations but insisted on
anonymity.
   The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments,
allows Noriega to return to Panama for holidays and to go back
permanently after presidential elections set for May 1989, said the
official, who described himself as opposed to the arrangement.
   He said Vice President George Bush has expressed reservations.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said Friday that the vice
president Bush opposes negotiating with Noriega over the conditions
under which Noriega might surrender power.
   ``The administration sources who have suggested that the vice
president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy
back to Washington are essentially correct,'' Fuller said.
   Bush had lunch with President Reagan Friday, but the vice
president's aides would not say whether they discussed the Noriega
negotiations.
   The official who discussed the tentative deal also said Bush has
recommended that the State Department recall deputy assistant
secretary Michael G. Kozak from Panama. Kozak has spent virtually
all of May in Panama trying to work out an agreement.
   The official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an
Associated Press reporter said, ``If it gets accepted, it gives
Noriega everything he wants.''
   The official said there were no assurances that Noriega was
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the
defense chief has no intention of resigning his post, as the
agreement specifies.
   If the deal receives final approval, the official said Noriega
would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of
authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the
transition government.
   Late Friday, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Kozak was returning to Washington for consulations.
   He said Kozak's return does not mean any change in the process.
   ``The process continues,'' Redman said, declining further
comment.
   Associates of Noriega have said in recent weeks that Noriega
sees Aug. 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the
fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Defense
Forces.
   The State Department view is that dropping the indictments
against Noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in Panama.
   It contends that if Noriega's price for leaving Panama is
dismissal of the indictments, this would be a low cost way of
resolving the 12-week old crisis, which has dropped U.S.-Panamanian
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in Panama.
   According to a published report earlier this week, the United
States would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once
Noriega returns to Panama.
   The Reagan administration has been calling on Noriega to step
down since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega on Feb. 25
but was ousted himself the following day by the pro-Noriega
National Assembly. The United States continues to recognize
Delvalle as the legitimate authority in Panama.
   A series of U.S. economic sanctions have contributed to Panama's
economic demise.
   U.S. apprehensions about Noriega were heightened on Thursday
when a pro-government newspaper published photographs of U.S.
Embassy employees and their families so that Panamanians will
``know the Gringos who are starving us to death.''
   The supplement in the newspaper Critica, a propaganda organ of
the government, said the Americans ``think the walls of their
embassy are impregnable.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the supplement
has been ``noted with concern'' and that appropriate security
measures have been taken.
   He declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any
Americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated.
   ``We have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in
Panama,'' Redman said. ``This appears to be part of that. The way
to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need
to be taken.''
   Redman had no comment on the negotiations. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater also refused comment except to say they were
continuing.

<HEAD>White House Dismisses Report Soviets Tap Mrs. Reagan's Astrology
Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House dismissed as ``foolish'' a
report Friday that the administration is trying to determine
whether telephone calls between first lady Nancy Reagan and her San
Francisco astrologer had been intercepted by Soviet spies.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``If the Soviets
wanted to monitor White House phone calls to get information on the
president, there are thousands of calls a day from White House
staff of more significance (than Mrs. Reagan's).
   ``The most definitive information they're likely to get (from
Mrs. Reagan's calls) is how many pizzas are ordered by the first
family,'' he joked. He said the column ``seems foolish to me.''
   On a more serious note, he said Mrs. Reagan does not have or use
a secure telephone, designed to prevent conversations from being
overheard.
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, said Mrs.
Reagan routinely places her calls through the White House
switchboard.
   In addition, Mrs. Crispen said Mrs. Reagan has paid the
astrologer an undisclosed amount of money out of her own pocket.
   Fitzwater's comments came in response to a column by Jack
Anderson and Dale Van Atta that said a White House official had
been asked to quietly find out whether Mrs. Reagan had a secure
line to astrologer Joan Quigley.
   The Soviet consulate in San Francisco can listen in on
long-distance microwave-transmitted telephone calls coming into
that city, the column said.
   The Soviets would, however, have to recognize and select the
calls from an immense volume of telephone traffic.
   Unnamed sources in the White House, CIA and National Security
Council said they have been asked to conduct the investigation
without telling President Reagan for fear of offending him,
according to the column.

<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed Contra rebels have still
not responded to a government proposal to extend the civil war
cease-fire past the May 30 deadline, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor
Hugo Tinico said Friday.
   ``They still haven't answered a government proposal to call off
for another month offensive operations,'' he said at a breakfast
meeting with foreign correspondents.
   The leftist government and the U.S.-supplied rebels known as
Contras have been exchanging charges on who's responsible for the
faltering peace plan to end more than six years of war.
   Almost two months after the two sides signed the pact, they
agree only on the desire to end the fighting. The government has
warned it will stage the largest offensive to date if the
cease-fire is not extended after May 30 or if no progress is made.
   The Contras, meanwhile, are suffering from infighting, a move
that favors the ruling Sandinistas. From the government's point of
view, the best way for the war to end would be for the enemy to
self-destruct.
   Pro-Sandinista newspapers were giving widespread coverage to the
Contra bickering. At the same time, the government last weekend
cautioned private radio station directors against broadcasting news
that violates the public order law and warned of permanent
suspension.
   Radio station directors called the warning a ``direct threat''
and described it as self-censorship that replaces the harsh media
restrictions withdrawn by the government to comply with last
August's regional peace plan.
   The problems surrounding the cease-fire plan appear to have
started almost immediately after the March 23 signing. All of the
meetings held since then have been marked by mutual distrust.
   The government announced on Wednesday a tentative agreement for
a new round of peace talks to be held May 25-28, but the Contras
immediately disagreed.
   The years of civil war have left deep scars in this nation of 3
million. Families are divided; sons have gone off to fight with one
side or the other.
   If all had gone according to plan, the war would just about be
over and Nicaragua would be well on its way to full democracy.
   A state security officer argued recently that Nicaragua already
was a democracy. His comments came minutes after police hauled off
several opposition political leaders who spoke to journalists near
a building where workers staged a hunger strike.
   Because the cease-fire plan has not moved forward, the
Sandinistas have not freed more than 3,000 political prisoners nor
permitted the Contras to have a say in internal politics.
   Talks with the internal opposition political parties stand at an
impasse. The meetings were suspended by the opposition as a show of
support for the strikers. The government responded by saying it
would consider whether future talks would be held.
   According to the cease-fire plan, the first measures should have
been completed by April 15. In exchange, the Contra rebels would
have gathered in agreed upon cease-fire zones and been permitted to
receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization.
   The Sandinistas have said the insurgents could now receive food,
medicine and clothes distributed by the International Red Cross.
But the Contras rejected that, saying the organization sympathizes
with the government.
   ``The tactics used at the last meeting were almost to torpedo
the agreement,'' Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in a recent
interview. ``They put into question everything we had agreed upon.''
   Meanwhile, thousands of rebel troops, according to sources,
moved toward the northern border. The U.S. Agency for International
Development is providing supplies to the Contras through Honduras.
   A group of rebellious Contras has demanded the ouster of the top
Contra military officer, Col. Enrique Bermudez, a former officer
under the ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Matamoros, the Contra's main spokesman, said recently the talk
of divisions was exaggerated.
   Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez said Sunday that the
Contra infighting puts into doubt future cease-fire negotiations.
   ``In Honduras the mercenary forces (the Contras) are on the
verge of civil war,'' he said. ``The political heads that come here
to negotiate have very little influence.''
   The people, meanwhile, are war weary. The Sandinistas continue
to draft youths into the military. The economy is in shambles. And
farmers who fled the war zones in the northern mountains cannot yet
go home to plant.

<HEAD>Senate GOP Group Says Displaced Workers Getting Inadequate
Assistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's displaced workers are not
receiving adequate job search assistance, training, counseling or
benefits, a study group for Senate Republicans reported Friday.
   The report by a task force of the Senate Republican Conference
said that of the more than 1 million American workers displaced
annually due to plant closings or layoffs, more than one-third of
them have extended periods of unemployment while some never return
to the workforce.
   Of those who do return, almost one-half take pay cuts and more
than one-third earn less than four-fifths of what they previously
had earned, according to the study group which was chaired by John
H. Chafee, R-I.
   The group recommended that Congress enact a $980 million Reagan
administration proposal which would consolidate two current
education and job training programs _ the Job Training Partnership
Act and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act.
   The new worker adjustment program is designed to serve an
estimated 700,000 workers and would seek to eliminate costly
duplication of effort. It would also provide substantially greater
emphasis on actual retraining.
   The 69-page report said that poor publicity, a general lack of
coordination among different federal assistance programs and a
``slow response rate'' when the programs have actually have been
implemented ``have plagued the delivery and quality of assistance''
to displaced workers.
   Projections for the next 15 years, it said, indicate that
millions of Americans are not only ill-prepared for existing jobs
but will have even more difficulty finding and holding jobs in the
future ``unless the work force is retrained and continuously
prepared for marketplace change.''
   The United States ``is faced with the creation of a growing
underclass, increasingly made up of former manufacturing and
industrial workers without the skills to enter (the work place),''
the report said.
   The GOP conference is an organization made of all 46 Republican
senators.
   In addition to Chafee, Sens. Dave Durenburger of Minnesota,
Orrin Hatch and Robert Stafford of Vermont were members of the task
force which held three field hearings of March and April of last
year and conducted interviews with dislocated workers, union and
business representatives, service providers and program directors.

<HEAD>Protesters Disrupt Opening Of Georgia GOP Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disgruntled Republicans, upset over the
disqualification of 968 would-be delegates, disrupted Friday's
opening session of the Georgia GOP convention by chanting ``no, no,
no'' and parading around the hall carrying placards.
   Many of the protesters were supporters of Pat Robertson's
presidential candidacy, but there were also supporters of Vice
President George Bush, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas.
   Meanwhile, party officials refused to register any of the
estimated 1,600 people attending the convention at the Albany Civic
Center.
   State Republican Chairman John Stuckey told the crowd the party
was barred from officially seating any delegates until the
credentials committee had issued its report on the disqualified
delegates.
   ``I can't proceed with registration until I know who is a
delegate,'' he said. ``I am acting on the advice of counsel. I
don't intend to register anybody.''
   The credentials committee began the court-ordered review process
Friday morning, just hours before the convention opened. Supporters
of Pat Robertson's presidential candidacy boycotted the review
process, however, saying they would attempt to seat their own
delegates.
   Stuckey called the convention to order about 2 p.m. amid boos.
On two occasions when party leaders were speaking, many of those on
the floor of the convention hall stood up and shouted.
   The dispute was over a May 11 letter sent by the credentials
committee to 968 of the delegates elected at county conventions,
informing them they had been disqualified as delegates to the state
convention.
   Most were rejected because local party officials had not
provided evidence that the county conventions were advertised in
newspapers. Many of the disqualified delegates charged that that
technicality had never been used before.
   A major order of business at the two-day convention is the
election of the final 18 of the state's 48 delegates to the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans. All 48 are committed
to vote for Bush on the first two ballots at the August convention
because the vice president swept Georgia's GOP presidential
primary. But Robertson supporters are seeking to attend, hoping
they can influence selection of the vice presidential candidate and
the party platform.

   The Syrian-backed Amal militia claimed
Friday it had foiled an attempt by guerrillas of the pro-Iran
Hezbollah group to trade a Western hostage for arms from a
Christian militia.
   The claim came as Amal and Hezbollah, or Party of God, battled
for the 15th day for control of south Beirut's slums. Police said
rival Palestinian factions fought house-to-house in nearby Bourj
el-Barajneh and Chatilla refugee camps.
   In the Palestinian fighting, police said one guerrilla was
killed and 36 people were wounded in combat that first flared in
Bourj el-Barajneh and then spread to Chatilla.
   They said guerrillas of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah
faction flushed out Syrian-supported dissidents of Col. Saeed
Mousa's Fatah-Uprising group from their five bases in the sprawling
shantytown near Beirut airport.
   The dissidents shelled the camp with long-range artillery in the
mountains overlooking Beirut in a bid to blunt the assault by
Arafat's loyalists, police said. They was no immediate report of
casualties.
   Amal politburo member Atif Aoun told 10,000 Shiites in the south
Lebanon town of Zahrani that Hezbollah had worked out an
arms-for-hostage deal with the Lebanese Forces, the Christians'
main militia.
   Amal foiled the alleged swap ``after we found out about contacts
between Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces,'' he said without
elaboration.
   Most of the 18 Western hostages held by Shiite factions allied
with Hezbollah are believed held in the embattled southern slums.
   Militia officials declined to identify the hostage or say how
the reported trade was thwarted.
   Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces denied the Amal claim.
   ``It's an attempt to distort Hezbollah's image,'' said a
Hezbollah spokesman, who refused to be identified.
   George Adwan, the Lebanese Forces political head, said: ``Atif
Aoun's baseless accusations constitutes a cheap attempt to cover up
Amal's military losses in south Beirut.''
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon Walters,
arrived in Damascus on Friday, but told reporters his visit was
``not specifically for the hostages.''
   The Syrians have been helpful in the past in securing the
release of foreign hostages, ``but I don't want to be in the
position of telling the Syrians what to do,'' he stressed.
   Hezbollah and the right-wing Lebanese forces are bitter foes in
Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war. The only thing they have in common
is that both oppose Syrian efforts to control Lebanon.
   Hezbollah has seized control of most of south Beirut in recent
fighting. But the Iranian-backed fundamentalists are penned up in
the slums by the Syrians on three sides and the Christians to the
east and apparently unable to get weapons and ammunition in.
   Amal remains entrenched in the Shiyah district on the northern
edge of the shantytown, where they have surrounded a Hezbollah base
in Hajjaj Street.
   A senior Amal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the arms-for-hostage exchange was to have taken place there.
   The Lebanese Forces hold the Christian district of Ein Rummaneh,
east of Hajjaj street. The two districts have been separated by a
25-yard-wide no-man's land since the civil war broke out in 1975.
   Police said the two factions fought with howitzers and mortars
Friday.
   Nine people were killed and 42 wounded in the fighting. That
raised the toll since May 6 to 253 killed and 814 wounded.
   The Syrians have deployed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks along the
southern, western and northern edges of south Beirut since Sunday,
but have made no move yet to push into the labyrinthine slums to
end the fighting and aid Amal, its battered proxy.
   Syrian officers have said this was to give political efforts a
chance to end the fighting, but those efforts have failed.
   In Paris, Le Monde reported that Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, the
Syrian intelligence chief in Lebanon, said Syria's entry ``into the
southern suburbs is inevitable.''
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's principal
Arab ally in its war against Iraq.
   But Damascus has been alarmed by Iranian efforts, through
Hezbollah, to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's
largest Moslem sect.
   In a change of stance, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
Hezbollah's spiritual guide, voiced cautious approval of a Syrian
deployment.
   ``The entry of Syrian troops is a possibility. No one is
thinking of confronting the Syrians,'' he said.
   A Canadian Protestant clergyman arrived Friday seeking to
deliver a petition from a Christian human rights group to Hezbollah.
   The Rev. Ray Barnett, representative of the Seattle-based
Friends in the West, said he hoped to hand the petition signed by
40,000 people from various countries to Fadlallah.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.

   A top aide to Vice President George Bush
invoked executive privilege Thursday when asked what was said about
narcotics when Bush met with the U.S. ambassador to Panama in 1985
in Bush's office.
   During a three-hour deposition, Col. Samuel J. Watson III,
deputy national security adviser to Bush, did answer some questions
posed by Lewis Pitts, the attorney for a group of plaintiffs in a
private civil lawsuit.
   Watson said he had prepared a memorandum to set up Bush's Dec.
16, 1985 meeting with Ambassador Everett Briggs. Briggs wanted to
discuss a situation involving Nicholas Barletta, who had been
ousted as Panama's president by military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, and the subject of narcotics, Watson said.
   Watson testified in the sworn deposition that he was present at
the meeting along with Bush's top national security aide, Donald
Gregg, and an official from the State Department.
   But when asked what Briggs told Bush on the subject of
narcotics, Watson's lawyer, Richard Stearns, objected and
instructed his client not to answer on grounds of executive
privilege. Stearns later said the privilege applies because it
covers conversations of the president and vice president.
   Pitts then asked Watson whether narcotics was discussed at all
in the meeting.
   ``I don't recall specifically whether they were or not. I could
make that assumption, but I will not state it as a certainty,'' he
said. Watson said he had since searched for any memorandum
summarizing the meeting, but could find no such document.
   Watson said he had only a vague knowledge of narcotics issues
involving Panama at that time. ``There were vague, unsubstantiated
rumors around that ... people in the PDF (Panamanian Defense
Forces) were facilitating trafficking of drugs,'' Watson said.
   The New York Times reported May 8, citing administration sources
it did not identify, that Briggs briefed Bush at the 1985 meeting
on allegations that Noriega was involved in the drug trade. Briggs
has since denied that he could have given clear indications of
Noreiga's drug involvement at that meeting, saying he himself did
not have any solid evidence at the time.
   Bush has repeatedly denied that he was aware of any clear
evidence of such involvement by Noriega before this February, when
the Panamanian general was indicted by two grand juries in Florida
on drug charges. His Democratic opponents in the presidential
campaign have questioned how much Bush knew about Noriega's alleged
drug involvement.
   Watson's statements came during a deposition for a $24 million
damage and racketeering lawsuit charging that a group of defendants
_ including some involved in the Iran-Contra affair _ supplied the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels with weapons in trade for cocaine. The
suit also accuses the group of planning the May 1984 bombing that
injured maverick rebel leader Eden Pastora in Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Famed WWII Agent Peter Julien Ortiz To Be Buried at Arlington
Cemetery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Marine Col. Peter Julien Ortiz, one of
the corps' most colorful and highly decorated World War II
veterans, will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday,
the Pentagon announced Friday.
   Ortiz, 75, died May 16 in Prescott, Ariz., of cancer. He was the
most decorated Marine to serve with the Office of Strategic
Services, the forerunner of the CIA.
   His exploits during the war were the subject of two different
motion pictures: ``13 Rue Madeleine,'' starring James Cagney; and
``Operation Top Secret,'' starring Cornel Wilde.
   Ortiz, born in New York City and educated in France, received
numerous decorations from the French and British governments for
his exploits, in addition to two Navy Crosses, the Legion of Merit
and two Purple Hearts.
   He was best known for his work in organizing French resistance
units and coordinating the delivery of arms, ammunition and
equipment to the underground after being dropped behind the lines
with a British-organized OSS team in 1943.
   Ortiz, who once assisted four downed RAF pilots in escaping
occupied territory, became the subject of an intense search by the
German Gestapo and ultimately turned himself in to the Germans in
1944 to spare local villagers from reprisals. He spent the
remainder of the war as a prisoner.
   Ortiz will be buried with full military honors at Arlington at 1
p.m. Monday, the Pentagon said. He is survived by his wife, the
former Jean Morlan, and a son, Marine Maj. P.J. Ortiz Jr.

<HEAD>Quake Fears Spur Exodus of Cambodian Refugees from Southern
California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recent powerful earthquake and an unfounded
prediction of a devastating temblor have spurred many Cambodian
refugees to leave Southern California, members of the community
said Friday.
   Fears have been widespread in the community since a quake Oct. 1
that measured 5.9 on the Richter scale, and were revived by recent
publicity about a purported prediction by the 16th-century seer
Nostradamus that Los Angeles would be destroyed by a temblor.
   ``How many people are leaving for this I really don't know. But
people are talking about it. People are leaving, are scared,'' said
Than Pok, executive director of United Cambodian Community, a
center for immigrant education and vocational training that serves
about 10,000 people a year.
   One reported estimate put the number of Cambodians who have fled
at 2,000.
   ``My real gut feeling _ 1,000 may be more realistic,'' Than said.
   An estimated 35,000 Cambodian refugees live in Southern
California, mainly in Long Beach. It is the largest Cambodian
community in the nation. Most came after the Vietnamese invasion of
Cambodia in 1979, Than said.
   Until last October there had been no significant earthquake or
other natural disaster in the Los Angeles area in the time since
the Cambodians arrived.
   The reaction to the October quake is based in Cambodian culture,
Than said. ``The Cambodian culture is a mixture of Buddhism,
Hinduism and animistic belief. They believe in the super (natural)
power, the storm, the earthquake, the fire, the flood. So this
theory is in the back of their mind. They think they cannot
control; they just fear,'' he said.
   Ben Kelly, director of the Department of Social Services in
Fresno County, 200 miles northwest of Los Angeles, said that 343
people of Cambodian ethnicity have been added to the welfare lists
since last October.
   ``That is unusual growth,'' he said, although he did not know
whether quake fears were behind the influx.
   Namany Keam, operator of the private Cambodian Translation
Bureau, said she did not know anyone who had moved, but there has
been a great deal of talk about people leaving to join friends and
relatives in such places as Arizona or Washington.
   ``Everybody is scared. Some of them just move. ... They'd rather
go to the cold states than the earthquake state,'' she said.
   Impetus to the exodus apparently also came from publicity about
a video, ``The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which a filmmaker
interpreted a vague prediction by Nostradamus to mean Los Angeles
would be destroyed by an earthquake in May.
   The purported prediction was dismissed both by scientists and
experts on Nostradamus.
   ``Cambodian culture really believes that ... somone can tell the
future,'' Ms. Keam said. ``When they talk about the fortune teller
in the newspaper and TV, they really believe.''
   Than agreed that such fears can be triggered by things such as
children being put through earthquake drills at school and the
frequent discussion of earthquake preparedness in California.
   ``This kind of thing, unless you make an effort to communicate
to people, they're never going to understand it,'' he said.
   Than said he wasn't certain whether the refugees were leaving
permanently.
   Vora Kanthoul, associate executive director of United Cambodian
Community's Orange County office in Santa Ana, said, ``There are
some fears around. To actually leave because of that fear, there's
only a small percentage.''
   He cautioned that exact estimates would be unreliable because
there is also migration north for economic reasons.
   ``People are moving. Quite a few businessmen are going up there
because of the opportunity, because Fresno, as far as the Cambodian
population, is growing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressional Negiotators Compromise on New Prescription Drug
Benefit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators reached tentative
compromise Friday on a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that
could clear the way for final votes on a catastrophic health
insurance bill next week.
   Rep. Fortney H. Stark, D-Calif., told reporters the drug issue
was the most complicated item separating House and Senate members
of a conference committee.
   Asked when the committee would have a final compromise ready for
submission to the House and Senate, Start said, ``I hope next
week.''
   But Stark noted that several other issues are outstanding,
including the precise way flat and sliding-scale premiums will be
imposed on the 31 million Medicare beneficiaries to pay for
additional benefits and whether participation in the expanded
coverage will be mandatory or voluntary.
   The tentative drug compromise being recommended by an
eight-member working group to the full conference committee calls
for the new benefit to be phased in starting Jan. 1, 1991.
   Medicare does not now cover any outpatient drugs except for a
handful of particularly costly medications such as anti-rejection
drugs for transplant recipients.
   Under the recommended compromise, Medicare would pay half the
cost of prescriptions in 1991 after a $600 deductible is met.
   Medicare would pay 60 percent of drug costs the following year
and 80 percent in subsequent years _ but still only on that portion
that exceeds $600 a year.
   The premiums charged beneficiaries to cover the new benefit
would be indexed each year to cover the cost of the program, which
is expected to grow each year.
   The initial level of those premiums and details of the indexing
are to be worked out in subsequent negotiations of the full
conference committee.
   The full conference also has to resolve several other, albeit
less thorny, differences.
   However, there is broad support for the legislation and
negotiators expressed confidence at their first public meeting
earlier this month that a compromise would be reached quickly.
   Both bills passed their respective houses by overwhelming
margins and are patterned after the basic framework proposed by
President Reagan.
   Neither measure makes provisions for long-term nursing home care
under Medicare, but would shield Medicare beneficiaries against
financially crippling out-of-pocket doctor and hospital bills.
   While the cap on how much beneficiaries would have to pay is one
of the issues still to be resolved, it is expected to be between
$1,043, the latest House offer, and $1,370, the latest Senate
offer. Medicare would pick up all hospital and physician costs for
a beneficiary after the cap is met in a given year.
   Medicare now pays full costs of only 60 days of a hospital stay
in a given year, minus a first-day deductible, and pays only 80
percent of doctor bills, no matter how high they range.
   On the cost side, the major disagreement is how to distribute
the additional premium Medicare enrollees will have to pay _
particularly the so-called supplemental premium that is tantamount
to an income tax surcharge for the estimated 60 percent of retirees
who would be subject to it.
   Each beneficiary will have to pay a flat monthly premium for the
catastrophic coverage, but about 40 percent do not have enough
income to make them also subject to the sliding-scale supplemental
premium that will be based on their ability to pay and be collected
through the income tax system.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's once-poor presidential
campaign raised and spent as much as front-runner Michael Dukakis
as they battled in last month's crucial Democratic primaries,
records filed Friday showed.
   With the expensive races in California and New Jersey still
ahead, Dukakis and Jackson each entered the month of May with $1
million-plus bank accounts.
   Jackson actually spent more than Dukakis during April, but a
good chunk of his spending _ $804,570 _ went to pay off loans,
according to the financial disclosure report he filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
   Jackson reported spending $4 million during the month, while
Dukakis spent $3.7 million as they dueled across such expensive
states as New York and Pennsylvania. Dukakis, the best financed
Democrat throughout the campaign, has borrowed no money.
   Jackson took out another $624,000 in loans in April, for a total
of $1.4 million in loans since the beginning of the year. Spokesman
Tom Schade said the loans borrowed and repaid last month reflected
a rotating line of credit the campaign has for operating expenses.
   Jackson ended the month with $1.1 million in cash on hand and
$548,741 in debts, his report showed. Dukakis had $1.4 million on
hand, and $699,906 in obligations.
   On the Republican side, certain nominee George Bush ended April
with $4 million in cash on hand after raising $2 million for the
month, including $1.2 million in matching funds, and spending $1.7
million. Bush also reported taking out a $20,000 loan for general
election campaign start-up costs.
   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, who suspended his campaign
last week, showed a debt of $1.4 million at the start of this
month, after raising $1.1 million, with $341,523 of that in federal
matching funds, and spending $1.1 million during April. Robertson
had only $29,473 in the bank.
   Jackson continued his steady upswing in fund-raising, with total
receipts of $4.2 million, including the loan and $1.7 in federal
matching funds, while Dukakis took in $3.4 million, including $1.1
million in matching funds.
   In receipts from contributors, the two remaining Democratic
contenders were almost dead even, each taking in about $1.9
million. While Dukakis has had many high-dollar months and has
proven a consistent fund-raising power, the April numbers reflect
the sophistication of Jackson's fund-raising arm.
   During the first half of April, Jackson was riding high on the
success he had achieved with his upset Michigan victory and wins in
other states. But he subsequently suffered heavy losses to Dukakis
in state after state.
   Dukakis' campaign said he has raised $23.6 million from the
start of his campaign through the end of April, including $6.8
million in matching funds, which are based on the amount a
candidate raises on his own. Jackson's campaign total through April
was $11.7 million.
   Dukakis' campaign is penny-pinching these days so it can spend
enough on the expensive June 7 California primary and still have
enough money for the summer convention operations without
surpassing the $27 million maximum set by federal law.
   The rules say candidates who receive federal matching funds can
spend no more than $23 million on their primary campaigns, plus
another $4 million for fund-raising costs.
   Dukakis through April had spent $18 million against the $23
million cap. But current spending is budgeted ``to the dime'' so
the campaign will leave itself with money to spend on the party
convention in Atlanta this July, said campaign spokesman Steve Akey.
   Dukakis treasurer Robert Farmer said in a statement that the
campaign has received money from 80,000 individuals whose
contributions averaged $170 each. He said his candidate's
fund-raising success reflects an ``excitement and enthusiasm
Americans feel'' toward Dukakis.

<HEAD>Singapore To Elect Future Presidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singapore plans to convert its largely
ceremonial presidency into an elected post with executive powers
and Lee Kuan Yew seems likely to seek that role after he retires as
prime minister.
   Confirmation that an elected president is in the works was made
in parliament Thursday.
   Legislation described as ``only a very preliminary draft which
needs considerable revision and improvements,'' has been prepared,
said Phua Bah Lee, a senior parliamentary secretary.
   Phua's brief statement was a written reply to a question
submited by Chaim See Tong, the only opposition member of
parliament. It ended four years of speculation that basic changes
were planned in the way this bustling island republic is governed.
   The president is now named by Parliament to a four-year term.
Wee Kim Wee, 72, a former diplomat and journalist, has been
president since 1985.
   In his national day address in 1984, Lee said the constitution
might be changed to prevent any future government from squandering
Singapore's ample reserves. He said an elected president with veto
power over access to these assets might be the answer.
   Lee has for years said he would like to follow the example of
many U.S. corporate leaders and step down at 65. He reaches that
age on Sept. 16.
   Goh Chok Tong, 46, who was named first deputy prime minister
after the 1984 elections, is positioned to succeed Lee. The prime
minister's eldest son, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
36, is also regarded as eventual prime ministerial material. A
retired army general, he entered politics less than four years ago.
   Observers here say the elder Lee would be a natural candidate
for the presidential post.
   A Cambridge-educated lawyer, Lee became prime minister in 1959
on a wave of anti-colonialism and with the help of Communists, whom
he later purged. But steady economic growth has endeared Lee to a
population of 2.6 million that enjoys one of the highest living
standards in Asia.
   On Friday, the island republic's Home Affairs Ministry said a
prominent Singapore lawyer arrested for plotting subversive
activities admitted he had links with a recently expelled U.S.
diplomat.
   The arrested lawyer, 59-year-old Francis Seow, was taken into
custody earlier this month under Singapore's tough Internal
Security Act for questioning into possible foreign interference in
domestic affairs.
   At the time, Singapore also ordered E. Mason Hendrickson, a
first secretary in the U.S. Embassy's political section, out of the
country for allegedly urging people to run for public office
against the governing People's Action Party.
   ``I found Hank (Hendrickson) to be a pleasant person. I
maintained cordial relations with him as he had been supportive of
my political intentions, which I found most encouraging,'' Seow
said in a sworn declaration made public by the Home Affairs
Ministry on Friday.
   The government also called on Washington to reprimand two of
Hendrickson's State Department superiors, who were not publicly
named.
   The United States denied the allegations and expelled Robert
Chua, a first secretary at the Singapore Embassy in Washington, on
May 11.

   President Reagan on Friday signed an executive

Administration at Bay St. Louis, Miss., as the John C. Stennis
Space Center in honor of the retiring senator.
   Reagan said in a statement that Stennis ``has steadfastly
supported the nation's space program since its inception. He has
demonstrated visionary leadership and has consistently worked to
assure United States world leadership and pre-eminence in space.''
   The president said the laboratory to be renamed ``has played and

   The 8-year-old boy accused of holding cocaine
for a dealer making sales in his neighborhood said Friday he has
worked for dealers for two years and spends the money he earns on
candy and ice cream.
   The boy said he made $5 to $30 a day as a ``stash,'' holding
drugs while the dealers made sales.
   ``It kills people,'' he said, when asked if he knows what
cocaine does. ``I'm gonna stop doing it.''
   In the last 10 years, police say, 10 children under age 10 have
been arrested for drug offenses.
   The boy's mother said drugs are rampant in the area, a poor
neighborhood of row houses west of downtown.
   His back door faces a debris-filled alley and the lot at the end
of the block is littered with empty liquor bottles, clothes and a
broken television.
   When he came home from school Friday, he announced he had read a
book and learned some new spelling words.
   ``I done all my work. I done my spellin' words. They's hard,''
he said.
   The boy was arrested Wednesday and charged as a juvenile with
possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He allegedly held 14
vials of cocaine, worth about $280, in his sweatsuit while Dale
Smith, 20, of Baltimore, allegedly made sales a few feet away.
   Smith was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and employing a minor
to distribute narcotics, police said. He was being held Friday
without bail.
   Police have withheld the boy's name because of his age. He is a
second- grader at Bentalou Elementary School, and has a learning
disability, school officials said.
   His 28-year-old mother, who is unemployed and has three other
children, said she would punish her son by prohibiting him from
watching television or playing outside all summer.
   ``Everybody is going to put the blame on me, and it's not my
fault,'' she said. ``I'm not out there seeing what these guys are
giving him.
   ``I'd suspected it. He'd come in the house with money. When I'd
be taking him outside, older guys would be calling to him. I'd say,
`Y'all giving my kid drugs?' They said no. I never found drugs on
him.
   ``I asked him, `Where'd you get the money?' He'd say, `My friend
give it to me.''
   Juvenile authorities are to determine if the boy should remain
with his mother or be sent to an institution or foster home.
   His father was killed in a drug-related shooting several years
ago, police said, and the boy was a witness to a drug-related
killing three years ago, his mother said.
   Mary A. Winterling, principal of Bentalou Elementary School,
said the boy is popular with teachers and pupils.
   ``He's made a lot of progress this year. He's become proud of
himself and proud of his work,'' she said in an interview Friday.
   The family moved from a public housing project two years ago
because of drug dealing and because two of the woman's older
children were molested.
   At Bentalou, teachers tried to keep the attention about the
arrest to a minimum, Ms. Winterling said.
   ``We have very young children here,'' she said. ``This morning
we wanted to make it as normal as possible. He has been through
enough.''

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis said Friday the Reagan administration ``owes the
American people an explanation'' of why it was doing business with
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   At a news conference at the Sacramento airport, Dukakis said,
``I and the American people want an explanation. ... Unless and
until we have that explanation, I'm not going to be satisfied.''
   Dukakis said President Reagan or Vice President George Bush or
``somebody in the administration'' should tell the American people
``who it was who thought it was in the interests of the American
people and this country that we do business with somebody who was a
known drug peddler and who was suspected of murder.''
   Meanwhile, in Washington, an administration official said U.S.
and Panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that
calls for Noriega to leave Panama by August and stay away until
next May.
   In return, the United States would agree to drop federal drug
indictments against him, said the official, who has followed the
negotiations. He commented only on condition he not be named.
   On another subject, Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis' administration
and finance secretary, Frank Keefe, announced new proposed spending
cuts, efficiency steps and revenue plans designed to improve the
bottom line of Dukakis' $11.9 billion state budget proposal for
next year by $217 million.
   Faced with a shortfall in tax collections, Dukakis is proposing
to cut $92 million from expansions he had previously proposed in
dozens of individual programs. He also signed off on a hoped-for
$47 million in savings through improved government operations. He
also hopes to raise millions more through bottle deposits and a
higher tax on cigarettes.
   In Sacramento, Dukakis addressed a rally in a plaza in front of
the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament as hecklers stood on the
steps of the church holding signs denouncing his stance in favor of
a right to abortion.
   ``Real Greeks don't kill babies,'' read one sign.
   As he spoke, hecklers chanted, ``Baby killer, baby killer.'' But
the chants were largely drowned out by the loudspeaker system.
   Asked about his position on abortion at the news conference,
Dukakis said, ``I don't favor abortion. I don't think it's a good
thing. I don't know anybody who does.''
   However, he said that he believes it is a matter of an
individual woman's choice, to be made according to the dictates of
her conscience.
   He said he understood people who had a different view but wished
``they could keep the decibel level down.''
   Earlier Friday, in Los Angeles, Dukakis said he expects to hold
regular meetings with rival Jesse Jackson, who has stepped up his
criticism of party rules as his presidential hopes dimmed.
   ``We meet,'' Dukakis said after an appearance at an East Los
Angeles high school. ``We met Sunday, we'll be meeting regularly.''
   Jackson has been pressing Democratic Party leaders to give him a
greater share of the votes of so-called ``super delegates,'' the
party and elected officials given automatic delegate status at the
nominating convention in Juy.
   Most of those delegates have been falling in line behind the
Dukakis candidacy, prompting Jackson to complain that he is
receiving a disproportionately small number compared to his primary
and caucus showings.
   Jackson said Thursday he expected to meet soon with Dukakis to
discuss strategy and issues.
   Dukakis campaigned in Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco
with less than three weeks before the June 7 California primary,
one of four that day. Dukakis expects to collect enough delegates
on the final primary day to put him over the 2,081 delegates needed
for a convention majority.
   When Dukakis took questions from the predominantly black student
body of the George Washington Preparatory High School, the very
first was, ``Is this a token visit?''
   When the Massachusetts governor appeared puzzled by the
question, the student said she wanted to know if his visit was a
rare appearance in a black neighborhood.
   Dukakis, who has made few appearances in black communities and
has largely conceded the black vote to Jackson, replied, ``I've
been in black schools for years. ... I'm here because this is a
very, very special place with a great reputation.''
   One student asked Dukakis if he was interested in running for
vice president on a ticket heaed by Jackson.
   Dukakis grinned and said, ``I'm not interested in the vice
presidency.''
   Dukakis' wife, Kitty, told the students how she became dependent
on diet pills and urged them to use her example to stay away from
drugs and alcohol.
   After the question-and-answer session, students had Dukakis don
a baseball-style jacket and then led him and his wife onto a stage,
which was set up for a performance of the musical ``Grease.''
Dukakis and his wife sat on stools at center stage while students
performed ``Summer Loving,'' a song from the show.
   The students tried to get Dukakis to wear sunglasses. At first,
he pushed them back on his forehead, then finally took them off and
handed them back.

<HEAD>WWII Vets No Longer Need Prove Atomic Radiation Caused Illnesses</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 3 grafs to show how many veterans affected and at
what cost. Picks up 4th graf pvs, The legislation</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Friday
making it easier for hundreds of thousands veterans to receive
disability benefits for exposure to radiation from the World War II
atomic blasts in Japan or from nuclear test explosions.
   Ordinarily, veterans claiming disability benefits must prove the
disability was connected with their military service. The bill
bypasses this requirement for a limited group of veterans with
respect to specified diseases.
   It applies primarily to cancer of various organs. The Office of
Management and Budget said more than 300,000 veterans would be
affected by the legislation, and the first-year cost was estimated
at $65.6 million.
   The legislation affects veterans who served with U.S. forces
occupying Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan. It covers the period from
Aug. 6, 1945, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima,
through July 1, 1946.
   Also covered are veterans held as prisoners of war in Japan
during World War II, or who served on active duty in Japan
immediately following such internment if they were subject to
exposure to radioactivity comparable to that of the veterans who
served at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   The bill also applies to veterans who participated in tests
involving atmospheric detonation of a nuclear device.
   Norman Solomon, Washington spokesman for the Alliance of Atomic
Veterans, called the new law ``a long overdue step toward taking
care of a very large and serious problem.''
   ``Deadly legacies of radiation exposure hang heavily over every
American community,'' Solomon said.
   The legislation would apply only to ailments that manifest
themselves within 40 years after the veteran's last possible
exposure to the specified sources of radiation or, in the case of
leukemia, 30 years afterward. This period already has passed for
veterans who served in Hiroshima and Nagasaki or were prisoners of
war in Japan.
   ``Enactment of this legislation does not represent a judgment
that service-related radiation exposure of veterans covered by the
act in fact caused any disease, nor does it represent endorsement
of a principle of permitting veterans to receive benefits funded
through veterans programs which bear no relationship to their
former military service,'' Reagan said.
   ``Instead, this act gives due recognition for the unusual
service rendered by Americans who participated in military
activities involving exposure to radiation generated by the
detonation of atomic explosives. The nation is grateful for their
special service, and ... (this bill) makes clear the nation's
continuing concern for their welfare.''

   The president of Panama told Vice President
George Bush in December 1983 of allegations that officials in his
country were connected to drug trafficking, but he also told Bush
the charges were untrue, a top Bush aide present at the meeting
said Friday.
   Bush's national security adviser, Donald Gregg, said that
then-Panamanian President Ricardo de la Espriella mentioned the
allegations at the end of a meeting in Panama. Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, now the de facto ruler of Panama, attended the meeting,
Gregg said.
   ``The vice president said he had not been aware (of the charges)
or he would have raised them'' with de la Espriella, Gregg
testified in a sworn deposition for a private civil lawsuit.
   ``We did nothing to follow that up'' after returning to
Washington, Gregg said. Bush was then chairman of the South Florida
Drug Interdiction Task Force.
   Gregg also testified that he was aware at the time that the
government of Panama had been helpful to the United States in
getting military supplies to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   Bush has said he had no reliable information connecting Noriega
to the drug trade until Noriega was indicted in February on drug
charges by two Florida grand juries.
   Gregg's testimony came during a day-long deposition as part of a
$24 million suit by the Christic Institute, a liberal policy group,
charging that a list of defendants, some of whom were involved in
the Iran-Contra affair, supplied the Contras with weapons in trade
for cocaine, and conspired in a failed attempt to assassinate a
maverick Contra field commander, Eden Pastora.
   Gregg's Justice Department attorney, Richard Stearns, voiced
repeated objections throughout the day to the questioning, charging
that it ranged far from the subject matter of the suit and was
being done for political purposes. ``I think it's quite clear you
have some other agenda in mind,'' he said at one point to Michael
Withey, an attorney for the plaintiffs.
   On Thursday, another Bush aide, Col. Samuel J. Watson, invoked
executive privilege and declined to answer when asked during a
similar deposition what Bush and the U.S. ambassador to Panama,
Everett Briggs, discussed about narcotics at a Dec. 16, 1985,
meeting.
   When Withey asked Gregg about the same meeting on Friday, he
agreed to discuss it but said his recollection was not specific.
   ``I think we came away from the meeting with Ambassador Briggs
with the sense that Noriega was a growing problem _ politically,
militarily and possibly in the drug area,'' Gregg testified. But he
said any drug problems involving Noriega ``were not highlighted''
by Briggs.
   Later in the day, Withey asked Gregg: ``The fact that General
Noriega may have had some involvement in the narcotics problem,
that was coming out of the December '85 meeting at that time, isn't
that correct?''
   Gregg responded: ``It would have been part of the general
picture of Noriega as a political problem, as corruption, and as a
general policy problem, yes.''
   But talking with reporters later, Gregg said he did not recall
any discussion of Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking. ``I am
saying that narcotics as a problem in Panama was part of the agenda
of the meeting. ... There was no discussion of any direct
connection between that and Noriega.''
   Earlier this month, Briggs denied a published report that he had
briefed Bush on allegations that Noriega was involved in the drug
trade.
   By the time of that meeting, Gregg said, Bush was chairman of
the president's anti-narcotics task force.
   It was ``certainly in the realm of the possible'' that Gregg was
aware of charges that Noriega was linked to drugs, Gregg said, in
part because he knew of similar charges that had been made against
a brother of Noriega's predecessor, Gen. Omar Torrijos, during
Senate debate over the Panama Canal treaties in 1978.
   ``Noriega was now in power, and it was possible to conjecture
that he'd become involved in some of that,'' Gregg said.
   Gregg also testified that a State Department briefing paper
would have been prepared for Bush's meeting with Briggs outlining
the background of the ambassador's concerns, and that the paper
would have been placed in Bush's briefing book to prepare him for
the meeting.
   That document is among papers sought by the plaintiffs in the
suit, but which have not been turned over by the government.
   After Noriega's indictment, Gregg said, the vice president's
office searched for documents relating to past Bush-Noriega
dealings.
   The search turned up ``a couple'' of documents from the CIA and
a State Department cable prepared after the 1983 meeting in Panama,
he said.

   The cocaine-smuggling conviction of Carlos Lehder
Rivas has heartened the front line in the drug war, but officials
acknowledged Friday they are far from destroying the violent
Medellin drug cartel.
   In the past month alone, drug agents have seized 3.7 tons of
cocaine in a single shipment of lumber, taken two tons from a
speedboat making a run into the Keys, and confiscated two tons more
hidden in food shipments.
   That dwarfs the 3.3 tons Lehder was convicted of smuggling into
the country from 1978 to 1980, though he is considered responsible
for much more.
   ``You've got an awful lot of heads on the Hydra you have to cut
off,'' Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr Jim Simpson said Friday, referring to
the multiheaded creature of Greek mythology. ``Lehder was one of
them.''
   In Jacksonville on Friday, the jury that convicted Lehder
decided the government can confiscate millions of dollars in real
estate on a Bahamian island, as well as several planes and other
items owned by Lehder. The issue of property forfeiture has to be
considered separately under federal law.
   According to Internal Revenue Service figures, Lehder earned an
estimated $250 million in the cocaine business. But it remained
uncertain how the government could take control of property in the
Bahamas.
   During the year Lehder has been in U.S. custody, cocaine
shipments into the country actually increased, and the absence of a
current U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty clouds future anti-drug
efforts, said Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook.
   ``We'd all be pretty silly if we thought that the arrest and
conviction of one man would stop drug trafficking,'' he said.
``It's very positive news, but it's just one small battle.''
   Simpson and other South Florida officials emphasize their
efforts to block drug imports are continuing.
   The Customs Service's ``Blue Lightning'' speed boat task force
released its 1987 statistics Friday, showing it helped arrest 255
people and intercepted almost seven tons of cocaine, along with
more than 200 tons of marijuana.
   The Colombia-based Medellin Cartel still ships up to 80 percent
of the cocaine that makes its way into the United States. The DEA
considered Lehder one of the four managers of the cartel until his
arrest early last year. The others have evaded _ and sometimes
defied _ Colombian and U.S. justice.
   The reputed top leader, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, has twice been
seized by Colombian authorities, and twice succeeded in slipping
from their hands. Another of Lehder's reputed co-leaders, Pablo
Emilio Escobar Gaviria, has been sighted frequently in Colombia but
never caught.
   The cartel has turned to violence to intimidate Colombian
authorities into abandoning cooperation with U.S. anti-drug
efforts, Hook said.
   In 1984, Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla was assassinated
by traffickers, and in January, Colombia's crusading Attorney
General Carlos Mauro Hoyos was gunned down. The successful
anti-drug candidate for mayor of Bogota was briefly kidnapped
during this year's campaign. And many believe the 1985 guerrilla
attack that killed many Colombian supreme court justices was
coordinated with the traffickers.
   Whether because of the violence or not, the U.S.-Colombia
extradition treaty has been invalidated by Colombia's supreme court
since Lehder's capture, and the issue is now on hold.
   ``The extradition treaty was the only tool the drug-trafficking
kingpins ever feared,'' said Hook, adding he hopes the conviction
will encourage Colombia to renew it.
   The lack of a treaty and the continued cocaine trafficking
doesn't mean Lehder's prosecution was a meaningless gesture, law
enforcement officials said.
   ``It shows this country does very well mean business when we
have a drug trafficker anywhere in the world,'' said Gerald
Hochman, director of a federal task force on the south Florida drug
trade. ``There is no way out _ if he's committed the crime, he's
going to pay the price.''
   The conviction was a boost to front-line officers combating drug
traffickers on a daily basis, especially those who have become
discouraged by talk of a deal to drop the drug indictment against
Panama's ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, officials said.
   ``We're delighted,'' the Coast Guard's Simpson said. ``One of
the complaints peope have been lodging for many years is that you
always get the small fry. This time we got one of the big guys.''
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who prosecuted Lehder in
Jacksonville, said the conviction is a psychological boost to all
agencies fighting drug trafficking.
   ``Every war in history has seen battles which have practical
consequences byeond the immediate consequence of the battlefied,''
he said. ``By that, I mean that they serve to catalyze national
will to win the war, or serve as a pyschological defeat for the
other side.''
   In that sense, Lehder's conviction was ``a very real, tangible
victory for the American people and for Colombia,'' Merkle said.

   A group of air travelers paid nearly $1,000 for
a champagne flight to nowhere, but there wasn't a complaint in the
bunch.
   Thursday's flight was aboard the supersonic Concorde, which is
starring at the Air-Space America '88 show at Brown Field, flying
passengers halfway to Hawaii and back on demonstration flights
scheduled to continue through Sunday.
   ``For me it was a dream of a lifetime to get a chance to go up
and do that sort of thing,'' said Barbara Hayes, 57. ``It was
especially wonderful to see how much darker outer space looks when
you're at 70,000 feet.''
   During the journey, the plane reaches Mach 1, the speed of
sound, and Mach 2, about 1,400 mph and twice the speed of sound. It
travels at a maximum altitude of 59,000 feet, from which the
Earth's curvature is visible.
   The flight includes a lunch of caviar canapes, smoked salmon,
chocolate mousse and French champagne. San Diego Postmaster
Margaret Sellers stamped post cards and letters with a
commemorative postmark featuring the Concorde.
   About 700 people are expected to pay $985 for the privilege.
   ``It's the excitement of it, the exclusivity of it,'' said Joan
Berliner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles insurance broker aboard the
first flight Thursday.
   ``I'm glad I did it,'' said Dick Davis, 64, a retired pilot who
figured he'd flown ``everything but the Concorde and a rocket.''
   ``I'm getting old now ... and I figured it was time to try it,''
he said.

   Sinhalese assassins shot and killed
the general secretary of the governing United National Party in
Colombo on Friday and fellow extremists killed four other people in
southern Sri Lanka, police said.
   Police Sub-inspector G. Kalupahana said two men opened fire with
AK-47 automatic rifles as Nandalal Fernando was being driven to his
office. Kalupahana said the killers and a third man escaped on a
motorcyle.
   Fernando was shot in the stomach and hand and died three hours
later at a hospital, according to police officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They blamed the attack on the People's Liberation Front, a group
of ultra-nationalist Sinhalese who vowed to kill anyone who
supports President Junius R. Jayewardene's peace efforts with the
Tamil minority.
   General secretary is the fourth-highest post in Jayewardene's
political party. The party chairman was assassinated in December.
   Military officials said other Front gunmen killed a postal
officer in Kotegoda town in an attempt to disrupt the delivery of
postal ballots for provincial elections early next month. The
victim's name was not disclosed.
   In a similar attack at Hakmana, also in the south, Front gunmen
tried to kill a mailman. He escaped unhurt, but his wife and two
neighbors were killed.
   The Front opposes the elections which are to be held as part of
the peace accord to halt bloodshed in this Indian Ocean island
nation.
   The government has blamed the People's Liberation Front in the
deaths of about 260 government officials and supporters since July
29, 1987, when the Tamil peace accord was signed.
   Fernando, like Jayewardene, belongs to the Sinhalese ethnic
group that controls the government and makes up 75 percent of the
nation's 16 million people. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the
population, say they are discriminated against in jobs and
education.
   Tamil rebels have fought a guerrilla war for nearly five years
for a separate homeland on Sri Lanka. They rejected the 1987
accord, which provides greater autonomy in Tamil-populated areas if
the rebels give up their weapons.
   India sent more than 50,000 soldiers to Sri Lanka, just off
south India, to enforce the accord, but the Tamils are now fighting
the Indians.
   On May 10, the government lifted a 5-year ban on political
activities by the People's Liberation Front after announcing it
signed a peace agreement with the Sinhalese radicals. The Front
denied reaching any agreement and pressed its attacks against
Sinhalese politicians.

   The Soviet Union's new space shuttle, a
reusable craft that lands on a runway, will make its maiden voyage
at about the same time that the U.S. space shuttle is scheduled to
return to orbit for the first time since the Challenger disaster,
an industry magazine reports.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology released a report Friday
saying the Soviet shuttle will be launched in August and ``roughly
coincide'' with the return to flight of the American space shuttle.
   Launch of the U.S. space shuttle is now expected in late August,
probably on Aug. 29, according to NASA sources.
   The Soviet space shuttle, which closely resembles the American
original in exterior design, is to carry two cosmonauts into orbit
in what is expected to be a short test mission.
   Earlier reports said that the Soviet shuttle's initial test
flight would be conducted unmanned, but officials disclosed last
week that the plans call for two pilots.
   Aviation Week quoted Soviet Lt. Gen. Vladium Shatalov, chief of
the Soviet space program, as saying, ``When the Americans tested
their shuttle, two men took off. I believe that this experience is
reasonable and can be used in our country.''
   The Soviet space shuttle is launched on a liquid-fueled rocket
called the Energia. Unlike the American craft, the launch rockets
are not a part of the orbiting craft. Instead, the Soviet shuttle
includes jet engines which can be used when the craft returns to
the atmosphere. This will give the Soviet shuttle a greater range
to manuever than the U.S. shuttle, which returns from space as a
glider with no engines.
   Challenger exploded shortly after launch from the Kennedy Space
Center on Jan. 28, 1986. Seven crew members were killed. Since
then, the shuttle fleet has been grounded while National
Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers redesigned and
tested flawed equipment, including the solid-fueled rocket engines
that were blamed for the accident.
   In August, space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to be launched
from the Kennedy Space Center with a crew of five, all veteran
astronauts, and land four days later at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif.
   Aviation Week said the Soviet shuttle flight is part of an
``unprecedented'' series of space missions over the next three
months.
   ``Never before has the USSR attempted so many major new space
missions withing the same period,'' the magazine said.
   Among the Soviet flights are:
   _Two robot craft to be launched to Mars and to the Martian moon
Phobos. The craft will lift off on July 7 and July 12 for the most
complex planetary missions yet attempted by the Soviets. The craft
will include instruments provided by eight countries and the
European Space Agency. The United States is not participating.
   _On June 7, a Soyuz spacecraft with a Soviet and a Bulgarian
cosmonaut will be launched to the space station Mir for an
eight-day mission. In August, a second Soyuz will be launched with
a Soviet and an Afghan on board.
   _Last Sunday, the Soviets launched a military intelligence craft
the size of a school bus in a 530-mile circular orbit.
   Two cosmonauts aboard the space station Mir completed their
150th day in orbit last Monday. The Soviet Union has now exceeded
128,000 man-hours in space, more than triple the U.S. total of
42,463 hours.

   Two days before he was found dead,
businessman Stephen Small taped a message to his wife said he was
buried alive ``inside some ... box'' and would die unless a $1
million ranson was paid.
   Tapes made by Small were played by the prosecutors Friday in the
trial of Daniel J. Edwards, 31, of Bourbonnais, who is charged with
kidnapping and murdering Small, a member of a prominent media
family.
   Small's widow, Nancy, was the final prosecution witness in the
5-day-old trial. She told jurors that her husband's comments were
on a recording played to her during a telephone call made early
last Sept. 2, shortly after he was lured from their home and
kidnapped.
   ``I'm inside some, I guess, a box,'' Small says on the tape.
``It's under a couple of feet of sand or something, like
underground ... and I want you to get $1 million.''
   The kidnapper spoke first, warning her not to call the police
but to raise the money quickly or ``he would never tell me where my
husband was buried,'' Mrs. Small said.
   Mrs. Small said her husband assured her it was not a joke, and
that the kidnapper wanted the ransom in 50- and 100-dollar bills.
   ``He said he hd enough air for 48 hours,'' Mrs. Small said,
recalling her husband's final words in that 3:30 a.m. telephone
call.
   Police unearthed Small's body two days later, buried in rural
Kankakee County in a homemade wooden box in which he suffocated.
   More than 100 people, including members of the Small family,
packed the Kankakee County courtroom to hear Mrs. Small's testimony
and to listen to the recordings.
   The defense was expected to begin its case Saturday.
   The first tape of Small and his kidnapper was found along a
road, and was reconstructed by the FBI. It was difficult to
understand at times, but the jury was given a transcript.
   Another call at about 11:30 p.m. Sept. 2 includes a recording of
Small reading instructions to his wife for delivery of the cash.
   The money was raised and the family was prepared to pay the
ransom, said Mrs. Small, but the quality of the recording was so
poor she could not understand all the instructions for delivery.
   ``I could hear another voice in the background swearing,'' Mrs.
Small testified. ``Then I realized it was Steve's voice. He was
giving me instructions ... where to take the money.''
   Small told his wife that after the cash was delivered and
counted, a map would be mailed to her giving directions to the
burial site.
   Mrs. Small said the kidnapper's voice came on the telephone and
she tried to get clarification of the delivery orders, but soon
``he just hung up the phone.''
   Small was lured by a telephone call from the family's Victorian
home near the Kankakee River shortly after midnight Sept. 2, 1987.
   Previous testimony has linked Edwards to the coffin-sized box,
which witnesses said they saw him building, and to a public
telephone at about the time a ransom call was being recorded by the
FBI.
   The woman with whom Edwards lived, Nancy D. Rish, 26, also was
charged with murder and kidnapping and was awaiting trial.

<HEAD>President Asks Senate to Ratify Anti-Torture Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan asked the Senate on Friday to
ratify a United Nations treaty against torture and ``demonstrate
unequivocally our desire to bring an end to the abhorrent
practice.''
   Reagan said, however, that if the treaty is ratified he will
declare that the United States does not recognize the competence of
an international committee it sets up to investigate charges of
systematic torture in the United States.
   ``I believe that a final United States decision as to whether to
accept such competence of the committee should be withheld until we
have had an opportunity to assess the committee's work,'' the
president said.
   The treaty was unanimously adopted by the U.N. General Assembly
in 1984 and was signed by the United States last month.
   ``It marks a significant step in the development during this
century of international measures against torture and other inhuman
treatment or punishment,'' Reagan said.
   ``Ratification of the convention by the United States will
clearly express United States opposition to torture, an abhorrent
practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today.''
   The treaty requires each signatory country to either prosecute
torturers who are found in its territory or extradite them to other
countries for prosecution.
   ``By giving its advice and consent to ratification of this
convention, the Senate of the United States will demonstrate
unequivocally our desire to bring an end to the abhorrent practice
of torture,'' the president said.
   Reagan also submitted to the Senate for ratification a treaty
signed in Montreal in February, under auspices of the International
Civil Aviation Organization, providing for international
cooperation in combatting terrorism at airports.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government regulators closed the doors Friday
of the Federal Land Bank of Jackson, Miss., named a receiver to
take over its troubled finances and vowed that it would soon reopen
under new management.
   Officials moved swiftly to reassure borrowers that the move was
made to strengthen the billion-dollar Farm Credit System
institution and that it would continue to meet needs of farmers as
well as obligations to those who hold the bank's securities.
   ``We have taken this prudent action in order to enable the Farm
Credit System to continue to provide a full range of credit
services to the borrowers in the three-state area,'' said a
statement from Frank W. Naylor Jr., chairman of the Farm Credit
Administration.
   The FCA, the federal agency that regulates the Farm Credit
System, placed the bank in receivership. The bank and its 90
branches in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana were closed
simultaneously at 5:30 p.m. EDT.
   Naylor said the bank, under the management of the receiver,
would be open during normal operating hours ``as soon as is
practicable.''
   ``The Farm Credit Act of 1971 as amended provides mechanisms to
assure that there will be no disruption of payment of principle and
interest on the banks' outstanding securities,'' Naylor said.
   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide network of borrower-owned
banks and lending institutions that has been a prime source of
credit for American agriculture for decades. Its heavily
spotlighted financial problems led Congress last year to approve a
major bailout bill.
   The Jackson bank earlier had received $30 million in assistance
under bailout legislation to raise funds. But it had been losing
$4.7 million a month since the first of the year.
   Its loan portfolio at year's end totaled $1.68 billion. As of
March 31, 40 percent of that amount represented loans classified as
not performing or at least at high risk. It reported liabilities of
$1.909 billion.
   Ronald E. Watkins, head of REW Enterprises Inc., Jackson, was
named receiver. His company issued a letter to customers saying
that ``every available effort will be made to continue serving ...
all borrowers.''
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. (Kika) de la Garza,
D-Texas, issued a statement calling it ``unfortunate that the
situation in regard to the Jackson Federal Land Bank has come to
this stage.''
   ``But I have been assured by FCA personnel that the liquidation
procedure will be similar to the procedure that the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation uses when closing a commercial bank,'' de la
Garza said. ``In fact, FDIC personnel are assisting with the
liquidation arrangements today.''
   ``Borrower stock and rights will be protected and operations
will begin almost immediately under a new bank structure,'' he
said. He added that he had been ``assured that other banks will
assist in providing necessary credit so that there will be no
interruption in providing for the needs of farmers.''
   The assistance board set up under last year's bailout
legislation recommended placing the bank in receivership, according
to an FCA statement.
   ``Borrower stock is protected by the recently passed
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 and will be retired by the receiver
with funds provided under that act,'' Naylor said.

<TEXT>
   A resolution presented to African
foreign ministers on Friday calls on all U.S. presidential
candidates to pledge to introduce comprehensive mandatory sanctions
against South Africa if elected.
   The ministers began a 5-day meeting Thursday to prepare
resolutions and an agenda for a summit meeting next week of the
Organization of African Unity.
   The ministers met in private, but sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the resolution was proposed by Zimbabwe's
foreign minister, Nathan Shamuyurira.
   The OAU, celebrating its 25th anniversary, has long tried to
persuade the United States, Britain, France and West Germany to
take the lead in mandatory sanctions against white-dominated South
Africa to try to bring about a peaceful end to apartheid. Its usual
tack has been to condemn the Western governments in end-of-summit
resolutions.
   This year, the OAU seems to be considering new strategies.
   Several states are pushing for a U.N. Security Council meeting
in southern Africa to dramatize what they say is the Pretoria
government's undermining of neighboring black states.
   Johnny Makatini, ``foreign secretary'' of the African National
Congress, the biggest guerrilla group fighting the South African
government, said in an interview that the ANC wants African leaders
to mount a new type of diplomatic offensive.
   ``For example, we have hardly been making use of the U.S.
lobbying system,'' he said. ``We want to establish contact and
solicit support of legislators in Washington for the sactions bill
before the Congress.''
   Makatini said the same strategy should be adopted for Britain,
France, West Germany and Japan.
   ``We're going to go for individuals,'' he said. ``For 25 years,
we have been relying on government or parties in power. But when it
suits a government it takes a militant position, when not, it
retreats.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruled Friday that
women in the black homeland of KwaNdebele must be allowed to vote
and nullified all-male elections held in 1984.
   Justice C.F. Eloff declared invalid a proclamation signed by
President P.W. Botha that denied women the right to vote or sit in
the homeland's legislative assembly.
   Botha and members of the legislature who opposed the court
action by five KwaNdebele women were ordered to pay costs. About 50
women wearing traditional colorful blankets attended Friday's
session at Pretoria Supreme Court.
   KwaNdebele is the only of South Africa's 10 black homelands
where women have not been allowed to vote.
   The judge also said the 1984 elections for 16 legislative seats
were null and void. One of the 16 seats was captured by Majozi
Mahlangu, who later was elected chief minister of the homeland by
the assembly. Of the 77 seats in the assembly, 61 are appointed.
   It was not immediately clear how or when the empty seats will be
filled and whether Mahlangu will be allowed to remain chief
minister.
   KwaNdebele is an impoverished area the size of Luxembourg with
almost no resources or infrastructure. About 400,000 people live in
the territory northeast of Pretoria, and many workers spend up to
eight hours a day commuting to jobs in white areas.
   The homeland currently has ``self-governing'' status but is
considering opting for independence, as four homelands already have
done. KwaNdebele authorities have been accused of harsh treatment
toward dissidents who oppose independence.
   Nic de Villiers of the Pretoria Legal Resource Center said the
police play an ``overtly political role'' in the homeland and often
mistreat activists.
   ``Not only does the tone of the police leadership permit
assaults, it positively encourages them,'' de Villiers said at a
recent conference organized by Lawyers for Human Rights.
   The South African government said it created the homelands so
that each major black tribe could exercise self-government on its
own territory. Critics of the system say it is part of the
government's effort to splinter the black majority so that
white-minority rule can more easily be maintained.

   Michael Somare, known to

stepped down Friday as opposition leader.
   Australian officials called it the end of an era in Pacific
politics.
   Somare, 52, told reporters he was ``calling it a day'' after
handing over duties as leader of the Pangu Party to his deputy,
Rabbi Namaliu. He gave no specific reason for his action.
   He is known as ``the chief'' in this Melanesian island nation of
3.3 million people. He led it to independence from Australia in

   The driver of the pickup truck that
slammed into a church bus last week pleaded innocent to 27 counts
of murder on Friday, one count for each person killed in the fiery
crash.
   Larry W. Mahoney, 34, of Worthville in Carroll County, was taken
to the psychiatric unit at the Kentucky State Reformatory in
LaGrange, where doctors will determine whether he is competent to
stand trial.
   The pickup was traveling in the wrong direction on Interstate 71
Saturday night when it plowed head-on into a bus from the First
Assembly of God Church in Radcliff. The bus was carrying 67 people,
mostly teen-agers, on their way home from an outing at an amusement
park near Cincinnati.
   The pleas were entered by Mahoney's attorney, Gary Sergent.
   Meanwhile, funerals were being held Friday in three states for
15 of the 27 crash victims, including an evening service for nine
youths and one adult at the church that owned the bus, Radcliff
First Assembly of God.
   In Bardstown, the funeral Mass for Sandy Brewer, 12, at St.
Monica Catholic Church ``just got terribly emotional,'' said the
Rev. Jim Graf.
   Family, clergymen and choir joined hands and wept in front of
the altar, he said, calling it ``a moment when the whole church
just let go together.''
   Mahoney, who police said was legally drunk at the time of the
crash, kept his head bowed or his eyes lowered throughout the
18-minute arraignment. He did not say anything.
   Earlier in the day, Mahoney had been released from Humana
Hospital-University of Louisville, where he had been treated since
the accident.
   That left 13 people injured in the crash still hospitalized
Friday, five of them in critical condition.
   After the hearing, State Attorney General Fred Cowan announced
that former Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney Paul
Richwalsky was named special prosecutor for the case to replace
Carroll Commonwealth's Attorney John L. Ackman Jr., who suffered a
heart attack Wednesday.
   Cowan said prosecutors still intend to seek the death penalty in
the case, and it was too early to consider a plea-bargain.
   ``We'll be going to the grand jury directly,'' Cowan said, ``and
the case will proceed from there.''
   Richwalsky said he believed the case was the first time in
Kentucky that the death penalty would be sought in a vehicular
homicide case.
   When asked how difficult the case would be to prosecute,
Richwalsky said: ``I can't answer that. You can't forecast what a
jury might do in a particular case.''
   Mahoney's mother, Mary, wept occasionally during the hearing,
while his father, John, also had to wipe tears from his eyes.
   About 50 people _ some of them Mahoney's friends _ gathered
outside the courthouse door as Mahoney was led to a state police
cruiser, some shouting ``Larry, we're with you'' and ``Hang in
there, Larry.''
   ``Larry loves kids and he would never have done this on
purpose,'' said a friend, Juanita White.
   ``He's a loving, caring person,'' she said. ``I don't think he
needs the death penalty. I think he's got enough to live with this
(the 27 deaths).''
   Billingsley set a bond hearing for May 25 and a preliminary
hearing for June 2 in Carroll District Court.

   More than 280 Vietnamese refugees sailed into
Hong Kong Friday aboard 14 boats, a government spokesman reported.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
refguees were intercepted by marine police throughout the day.
   He said no other details of the refugees were available.
   According to the spokesman, the latest arrivals brought to 2,107
the number of Vietname refugees who arrived in this British colony
this month.
   At present, there are more than 12,000 Vietnamese boat people in
Hong Kong awaiting resettlement overseas.
   More than 9,000 of them are housed in closed camps because they
arrived here after the government introduced a tough new policy in
1982 to deter the refugee influx.
   The others live in open camps, where they have freedom of
movement and are allowed to take jobs in the British colony.
   The Hong Kong government is currently considering whether to
scrap the policy of offering Vietnamese refugees temporary asylum
in the colony in order to stop the influx from Vietnam.

   The legal problems of soul singer James
Brown and his wife, Adrienne, continued Friday with Mrs. Brown
arrested for the third time in a little over a month and charged
with possession of the drug PCP, police said.
   Mrs. Brown's arrest came two days after her husband was arrested
on drug and weapons charges, assaulting his wife and resisting
arrest.
   Brown, 55, denied he has a drug problem when he posted bail
Thursday, and his lawyer said he would petition the court to let
the man known as ``The Godfather of Soul'' leave the country for a
European concert tour.
   Mrs. Brown, 38, of Beech Island, S.C., was arrested at the
airport in nearby Augusta on Friday afternoon after arriving on a
flight from New York. Police acted on a tip that she would be
carrying drugs, said Ron Maher of the Augusta Police vice and
narcotics unit.
   Narcotics investigators stopped Mrs. Brown in the Bush Field
parking lot and confiscated a wet, leafy substance believed to
contain PCP. She was taken to the Richmond County-Augusta Law
Enforcement Center, where police said a search turned up a further
two vials suspected to contain PCP hidden in her blouse. She was
charged with possession of PCP.
   PCP, also known as ``angel dust,'' is a powerful psychedelic
drug.
   On May 10, Mrs. Brown was arrested in Bedford, N.H., after a
small fire in her hotel room and later charged with possession of
PCP, criminal mischief and arson. Bedford Police Chief Richard
Audette said Mrs. Brown is due to appear in Bedford District Court
on Wednesday.
   She also was arrested in Augusta on April 9 and charged with
possessing PCP. She claimed at the time that she had been set up by
a friend of her husband's.
   On Thursday, Brown posted $24,218 bond and was released from
Aiken County jail on condition that he not leave South Carolina,
Magistrate Max Meeks said.
   He was arrested near his home Wednesday after his wife called
police and said he was abusing her. Brown was charged with
possession of PCP, resisting arrest, illegal possession of a
pistol, failure to stop for a police car and simple assault and
battery.
   The arrest was his third in six months.
   ``It's getting to the point where we're spending a lot of time
investigating Mr. Brown's domestic problems,'' said Capt. James
Whitehurst of the Aiken County Sheriff's Department.
   Brown said Thursday his wife planted the drugs on him and that
he was working ``to keep the city and the world clean'' of drugs.
   ``I don't have a drug problem,'' he said.
   Brown's attorney, Bill Weeks, said he expects to ask that Brown
be allowed to go on the tour.
   ``That's how (Brown) earns his livelihood,'' Weeks said.
   Brown was allowed to tour in Brazil in April after posting bond
on charges of assault with intent to kill his wife and with assault
and battery of a high and aggravated nature.
   Mrs. Brown has filed for divorce, and her husband said he plans
to do the same.

<HEAD>Blacks Could Swing Presidential Election to Democrats, Hooks Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks could provide the crucial votes that swing this fall's
presidential election to the Democrats even though Jesse Jackson is
not likely to be the party's nominee, Benjamin L. Hooks, head of
the NAACP, said Friday.
   Hooks talked about the presidential campaign at a news
conference before making a commencement address at Central
Connecticut State University in New Britain, Conn.
   The head of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People forecast that the black vote ``will be predominantly
Democratic,'' but he said he hoped that ``both parties will look at
this black vote, which can constitute 10 to 12 percent of the
general electorate vote, as a vote that ought to be pursued
diligently.''
   He said blacks should make efforts not to appear to be the
captives of one party. ``If that becomes the fact, then we will be
ignored by the Democratic Party and overlooked by the other party
and we become of no consequence,'' he said.
   Hooks said Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis appears to have
locked up the Democratic presidential nomination. Jackson will have
a hard time deciding whether to accept the vice presidential
nomination, if it is offered, he added.
   ``The only thing you could give (Jackson) that would be bigger
than what he has would be the presidency and it appears at this
point he won't get it,'' Hooks said. ``He's a young man and I think
he'll be running for president for the next 20 years and maybe one
of these years he'll make it.''
   In his address, Hooks urged 2,015 graduates to vote and noted
that fewer than 60 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the
1984 presidential election.
   In Charleston, S.C., former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
urged graduates of the Medical University of South Carolina to
combat the use of illegal drugs and said exporting health care will
help friendly democracies take hold overseas.
   ``Only healthy people have the strength really needed to win
freedom and maintain it against all manner of tyranny,'' Weinberger
told a commencement audience of about 4,000, including 554
graduates.
   Some graduates circulated a statement during the ceremonies
protesting Weinberger's selection as speaker and the university's
proposed involvement in research and health at the Savannah River
Plant, the nation's only plant making weapons-grade plutonium.
   In New Haven, Conn., actress Susan Saint James received an
honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Southern Connecticut
State University Friday for her contributions to the international
Special Olympics.
   The Connecticut resident is vice president of the state's
Special Olympics and chairwoman for national affairs for the
national organization.

   A Justice Department employee fired because he
has AIDS-related complex is being reinstated in his old job on a
part-time basis, the department said Friday.
   Mark W. Gregory, a clerk-typist in the department's community
relations service, will return to work Monday and work 4{ hours a
day five days a week, department spokesman Patrick Korten said.
   Gregory was dismissed April 11 because he was absent for 30 days
during the nine months he worked for the service.
   He said a supervisor suggested he take 10 days leave without pay
after he was diagnosed as having AIDS-related complex, a less
severe form of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Gregory said he
took 14 days' leave without pay to participate in an experimental
treatment program at the National Institutes of Health.
   After his dismissal was publicized this month, the Justice
Department offered to rehire him in a temporary one-year post.
Gregory rejected that offer this week, saying he wanted to be
reinstated in his old job because it was a permanent position
carrying more protections and benefits.
   Korten said the department reached the latest decision to
reinstate him after considering new conditions relating to his
health, including a stabilization of his physical condition. Korten
said the department also wanted to conclude the matter in a fair
and humane manner.
   ARC is a contagious condition that indicates a victim has been
exposed to the AIDS virus. ARC patients don't necessarily develop
AIDS, however.

<TEXT>
   As the Japanese planes headed toward Pearl
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, Pfc. Joseph Lockhard tracked mysterious
blips on his radar screen on the island of Oahu.
   ``We picked up a huge indication on the scope of something. We
had no idea what it was,'' he said Friday. ``We didn't know if it
was a bird, Superman or a plane.''
   He and another young serviceman were alone in the radar room,
watching the pulsing signal move steadily toward the island.
   Lockhard relayed the information by telephone to a lieutenant,
who brushed aside the concerns of the 19-year-old Army Signal Corps
radarman, noting that it was probably a squadron of B-17s en route
from California.
   ``We continued to plot it and track it and called back again. I
was more insistent. But nothing was done,'' he said. ``We plotted
it to within 20 miles of the island, and at that point, the signal
became lost in the terrain.''
   Moments later, ``We had been attacked. You could see the smoke
rising. We immediately knew what we had seen.''
   About 3,700 American servicemen and civilians were killed in the
attack.
   Friday, Lockhard and other members of the Signal Company, Air
Warning, Hawaii, met in Baltimore for the first time in 47 years,
and a visit to the Historical Electronics Museum Inc. in this
suburb, where a model of the SCR-270 radar is on display. The
device was built by Westinghouse Defense in Baltimore.
   The SCR-270, which tracked the approach of the planes, was ``the
Model T of radar,'' said Lockhard, a retired project manager at AMP
Inc. in Harrisburg, Pa., a maker of electrical connections.
   ``Many people had faith in it, but there were also a lot of
doubting Thomases. A lot of military people looked on it as a
toy,'' he said. ``They didn't believe in it enough to believe it
was the valuable tool that it was.''
   Six radar units had been delivered to the island about three
months earlier, he said.
   ``It was a brand new animal,'' Lockhard said. ``We had no idea
it was an enemy attack, other than we thought something was wrong
with the equipment. I ran it through a series of checks.
   ``The feeling was more like incredulity. It was phenomenal. It's
one of the footnotes to history. You can play out all sorts of
`what if' games.
   ``The real value to the whole thing, I've always felt, was it
gave credibility to the equipment. Everybody recognized the
potential, where some didn't before.''

<HEAD>Japan Must Offer New Ideas On Beef, Citrus Imports, U.S. Aide Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. negotiator Michael B. Smith served notice
Friday that America is willing to pursue talks on opening the
Japanese market for imported beef and citrus, but that it is up to
Japan to offer new proposals.
   Smith, the deputy U.S. trade representative, was in Japan to
attend the three-day Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, which
ended Friday. He met for unofficial talks with officials at the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Thursday.
   On Friday, he told a news conference at the U.S. Embassy, ``The
U.S. is prepared to listen, but we feel the Japanese must show more
flexibility in their position. ... It is not up to the United
States to make more proposals, but up to Japan.''
   ``We're over here and they're over there,'' he said, adding that
as a negotiator he saw no reason for optimism yet.
   Smith said Japan's semi-governmental Livestock Industry
Promotion Corp., which controls imports of beef, ``interferes in
the market'' and ``should stay out of our business.''
   The corporation charges a 50 percent tax on imported beef before
it is sold to wholesalers.
   He reiterated the U.S. position against surcharges on beef
imports, saying such surcharges hurt foreign exporters and violate
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based forum
for international trade disputes.
   Smith said that unlike tariffs, surcharges are unilateral
measures which involve no ``swapping'' with trading partners and
``upset the balance set in tariff negotiations.''
   He said surcharges fluctuate to stabilize prices and add an
element of uncertainty to exporters, while tariffs are fixed and
transparent.
   In response to a reporter's question, Smith also said an
increase in Japan's tariffs ``would seem exceedingly strange''
since tariffs are a transitional measure to cushion producers
during structural changes.
   Instead, Smith suggested that Japan establish a domestic income
maintenance system that would not burden foreign exporters.
   Though both sides have expressed a desire to settle the dispute
between themselves, the United States has brought the issue before
GATT and will keep pursuing GATT action ``until and unless there is
a bilateral decision,'' Smith said.
   An earlier U.S.-Japanese agreement setting quotas on U.S. beef
and citrus exports to Japan expired in March. Talks to set a new
timetable for market liberalization broke down, and Washington took
its case to GATT on May 4.
   Australia, another major exporter of beef to Japan, has also
filed a complaint with the international body.

   Senators gave the public a peek at their
personal finances Friday, disclosing a generally well-to-do group
that loves to talk for money, collects interesting gifts and leans
toward conservative investments.
   Release of the financial disclosure forms, required annually,
showed there are far more millionaires in the Senate than are found
in most other 100-member groups. Some, although not many, of the
senators are not doing nearly so well, including Joseph R. Biden
Jr., D-Del., the former presidential candidate, and Robert W.
Kasten, R-Wis.
   Biden's assets, not including the family home, total only
$21,000 and his liabilities are at least $260,000. But he earned
more than $110,000 last year, including his $87,483 Senate salary.
   Kasten reported assets of $21,000 to $45,000 and liabilities of
$20,000 to $30,000.
   Although it is possible that as many as three-dozen senators are
millionaires, it is difficult to determine real financial worth
from reading the disclosure reports. Senators are required to
report income, assets and liabilities only within a broad range;
for example, a $10 million investment need be reported only as
exceeding $250,000.
   On that basis, John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., the Standard Oil
heir who could be the Senate's richest member, is shown as having
assets of at least $882,000 and income of at least $390,000.
Another millionaire, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., put no dollar
value on the trusts that make up the bulk of his wealth although he
reported income of at least $596,747. Kennedy has the type of
trusts whose worth are not subject to the disclosure law.
   Some other probable millionaires: John C. Danforth, R-Mo., a
member of the Ralston-Purina family; John Heinz, R-Pa., of the
ketchup-and-pickle family; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; Lowell Weicker,
R-Conn., of the Squibb drug fortune; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; John
Warner, R-Va.; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; and Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; John Stennis,
D-Miss.; and Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas won top honors in the
talk-for-pay category last year. He reported $106,050, mostly for
speechmaking, and gave $80,000 of it to charity. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., picked up $47,350 in honoraria, giving $12,500 to charity.
   Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., reported $37,350 in honoraria; David
Boren, D-Okla., $59,175, almost $30,000 of which was given to
charity; Tom Daschle, D-S.D., $60,450, including $23,450 given to
charity; and Sam Nunn, D-Ga., $50,500, of which $16,007 went to
charity.
   Senators are allowed to earn as much as they like by
speechmaking, but they cannot keep for their own use honoraria
exceeding 40 percent of their Senate salary. The salary reached its
current annual level of $89,500 in March, meaning that members
earned slightly less than that in 1987.
   Several senators picked up pocket change last year by writing
for newspapers and magazines. The New York Times' standard fee
appeared to be $100; the Los Angeles Times paid $150 or $200; USA
Today paid $150; the Christian Science Monitor paid $33.33. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., pocketed $300 for an article in Conservative
Digest.
   A few listed among their honoraria fees for ``appearances'' _ no
writing or speaking, just appearing. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was
paid $2,000 for an appearance before McDonnell Douglas aircraft
company in St. Louis. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., got $1,000 for an
appearance before the American Business Conference.
   Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., whose panel
oversees the securities industries, owns not one share of stock.
Like many colleagues, he favors tax-free municipal bonds; freshman
Robert Graham, D-Fla., a millionaire, laid out a list of
municipal-bond holdings that appeared to include an issue for every
hamlet in his home state.
   Senators consider banks a safe place to put their money.
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., reported all his assets _
a maximum of $70,000 _ in bank accounts. The largest single
investment held by David Durenberger, R-Minn., outside his blind
trust was in a bank certificate of deposit.
   Senators visited the far reaches of the Earth last year, and in
many cases, a special-interest group of one kind or another picked
up the tab.
   Tom Harkin, D-Iowa., was reimbursed for travel to Hollywood to
give a $2,000 speech to the International Foundation for the
Conservation of Birds. Kasten and his wife, Eva Jean, went to
Santiago, Chile, at the expense of the U.N. Economic Commission for
Latin America. Daschle got $2,000 and expenses for speaking to the
Chamber of Commerce of Curacao.
   Among the gifts: Thad Cochran, R-Miss., got a framed
illustration of the Battle of Corinth; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a
$180 case of scotch; DeConcini, two clock radios and a Navajo rug;
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a $150 ring to commemorate Texas A&M's Cotton
Bowl championship; Kent Conrad, D-N.D., World Series tickets valued
at $320 from baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth.
   Some other disclosures:
   _A dozen senators list zero liabilities.
   _Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., was paid an $800 advance for
his new book.
   _Paul Simon, D-Ill., a former candidate for president, was paid
$1,250 by Northwest Airlines for losing his luggage.
   _Armstrong, a millionaire, had no honoraria, no liabilities and
no gifts to report.
   _J. James Exon, D-Neb., spoke to the American Association of
Airport Executives in Waikowa, Hawaii. He was paid $1,000 plus $934
``mounting of fish for Mrs. Exon.''
   House members' disclosure forms will be released next Wednesday.

<HEAD>Turkey Rejects Negotiations With Greece For Full EEC Membership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkey has rejected a West German proposal
that it negotiate with Greece in a move to improve Turkey's
association with the European Economic Community, Foreign Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said Friday.
   Turkey also said it will not discuss with Greece the dispute
over Cyprus, divided between Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot communities.
   Greece is a member of the European Economic Community, or Common
Market. Turkey has been an associate member since 1966 and a year
ago it applied for full membership.
   West German officials have told Turkey that an EEC meeting with
associate members cannot be convened before Germany's rotating
presidency of the organization ends June 30, Yilmaz said.
   Greece then will assume the presidency for six months.
   ``We were told that the future of the meeting depended upon
bilateral talks between Greece and Turkey,'' Yilmaz told reporters.
   Yilmaz will go to Athens Monday for talks with Greek officials
but he said neither Cyprus nor the EEC issue would be discussed.
   ``In our understanding the Cyprus problem is not a bilateral
issue even though it influences these relations,'' he said. ``Our
relations with the EEC is not a bilateral issue either. It is out
of the question that the matter will be raised in my talks in
Greece.''
   Monday's meeting in Athens will be the first of a Turkish-Greek
political committee established under a recent accord to improve
relations between the historic rivals.
   Another joint committee to consider cultural exchanges and
cooperation in trade and tourism will meet in Ankara Tuesday.
   The two committees were set up following a meeting in the Swiss
resort of Davos last January between prime ministers Turgut Ozal of
Turkey and Andreas Papandreou of Greece.
   But Greece maintains that the presence of Turkish soldiers on
Cyprus is a major obstacle fo improved bilateral relations and
Turkish links with the European Economic Community.
   Turkey insists that Cyprus is not part of the Davos
reconciliation and that dispute should be resolved under United
Nations sponsorship.
   Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after Greek-Cypriot national guard
officers briefly seized control of the government in an effort to
make the island part of Greece. Northern Cyprus now is controlled
by Turkish Cypriots and the southern zone by Greek Cypriots.

<HEAD>Communist Official Rejects Cardinal's Letter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior government official on
Friday dismissed a critical letter from a Roman Catholic leader as
too confrontational, an official report said.
   Deputy Premier Matej Lucan rejected the cardinal's letter at a
meeting of church dignitaries and cultural officials. He said the
letter ``adopts and authorizes opinions of those who actually try
to misuse the interests of believers and churches for political
purposes leading to pressure.''
   In the letter, dated April 23, Czechoslovak Catholic primate
Frantisek Tomasek demanded a new state policy toward religion. He
signaled Catholics were ready to fight for religious freedom.
   Relations between the Communist authorities and the church have
been strained over the government's refusal to allow any bishops to
be appointed in the last 15 years. The Vatican has refused to
accept candidates from the state-sponsored clergy association Pacem
in Terris.
   Half a million Catholics signed a petition organized by a
Catholic lay activist in December to demand more bishops, more
priests and an end to harassment for churchgoers.
   The cardinal, in the letter sent to Premier Lubomir Strougal,
said that force used by police to break up a peaceful demonstration
in Bratislava in March illustrated the need for a new policy of
dialogue.
   Tomasek said contacts between the state and church had reached a
state of crisis. He said that Catholics who ``are conscious of
their rights will demand them and are prepared to make sacrifices.''
   Lucan, however, responded that ``due to its confrontation
platform and tactless procedure, the letter cannot create a basis
for constructive relations, and the government is therefore forced
to reject it.''
   Lucan also complained that the letter was made available to the
Western media ``as background material for new attacks.''
   Authorities and the church recently reached agreement on the
appointment of two bishops to assist Tomasek and an apostolic
administrator for the Slovak diocese of Trnava.
   Still, 10 of the country's 13 bishops' posts remain vacant, a
situation the cardinal described as ``catastrophic.'' The three
bishops are all over 75.

   The U.S. conviction of Colombian drug
trafficker Carlos Lehder Rivas received scant attention in
Colombia's press Friday with most papers concentrating on
Colombia's 3-1 soccer victory over Finland.
   None of Colombia's 20 daily newspapers ran editorial comment on
the case and several did not mention the case at all.
   No public demonstrations for or against the conviction were
reported. Indeed, the legal aspects of the case drew the most
attention.
   Former Justice Minister Felio Andrade said Friday that a
U.S.-Colombia treaty limits to 30 years the U.S. sentence that may
be imposed on convicted drug traffickers extradited from Colombia,
echoing a point that Lehder's lawyer tried to make in the United
States.
   Lehder's seven-month trial in U.S. District Court in
Jacksonville, Fla., ended Thursday when he was convicted of
smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine and of related charges. He faces up
to life plus 150 years in prison and $350,000 in fines when he is
sentenced July 20.
   In an interview with the radio chain Caracol former Cabinet
member Andrade said, ``The Colombian government should make a case
in the U.S. courts to the effect that a Colombian citizen cannot be
sentenced ... to a term not encompassed by Colombian law.''
   The maximum sentence in Colombia is 30 years in prison.
   Another former justice minister, Jose Manuel Arias Carrizosa,
criticized the trial for using evidence from criminals trying to
get lighter sentences. However, Colombia's attorney general,
Horacio Serpa Uribe, said soon after the conviction that Lehder was
known to be involved in the drug trade.
   Colombian authorities captured Lehder on Feb. 4, 1987, and he
was extradited the same day.
   Lehder is the biggest Colombian drug trafficker ever convicted
in a U.S. court. He was identified as belonging to the Medellin
Cartel, a group of Colombians who control cocaine smuggling into
the United States.
   A 1979 treaty says no Colombian extradited to the United States
can be sentenced to more than the maximum penalty _ 30 years in
this case _ that the defendant would have faced in Colombia.
   After Lehder was extradited last year, Colombia's Supreme Court
ruled the extradition treaty unconstitutional on a technicality.
Lehder was the last of 15 people sent by Colombia to the United
States to face drug charges.
   The U.S. State Department insists that the treaty is valid.
   Former Minister Arias Carrizosa suggested in a broadcast
interview Friday with Caracol that Lehder did not get a fair trial
because much of the evidence against him came from criminals on the
lookout for reduced sentences for themselves.
   Serpa Uribe told reporters during an impromptu news conference
Thursday that Lehder's conviction did not surprise him since
``Lehder's link to drug trafficking was common knowledge.''
   While in Colombia, Lehder bragged publicly about being involved
in drug trafficking.
   Earlier this year in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras,
thousands of people rioted to protest the extradition to the United
States of Juan Ramon Matta, accused of being a major drug smuggler.

<HEAD>US and Panamanian Negotiators Agree on a Noriega Deal</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 3 grafs after 8th graf bgng, `The talks,' to UPDATE
with Noriega not commenting on reports of deal, saying there can be
no discussions without respect for the Panamanian president</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Panamanian negotiators have
tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to leave Panama for nine months starting this August and
for the United States to drop drug smuggling indictments against
him, an administration official said Friday.
   The arrangement would give Noriega a role in setting up a
transition government before leaving, said the official, who has
followed the negotiations but insisted on anonymity.
   The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments,
allows Noriega to return to Panama for holidays and to go back
permanently after presidential elections set for May 1989, said the
official, who described himself as opposed to the arrangement.
   He said Vice President George Bush has expressed reservations.
   However, one of Noriega's criminal attorneys in Miami said
Friday night that no agreement has been reached.
   ``I've just talked to a high-ranking member of General Noriega's
staff in Panama City, and he denies that any deal has been
struck,'' Raymond Takiff said.
   Roman Popadiuk, deputy White House press secretary, also denied
that a tentative agreement had been reached.
   ``The talks have not broken down, nor has there been any
agreement,'' he said. ``The process still continues.''
   Noriega on Friday made no reference to the reports of a deal
when he addressed thousands of supporters in the San Miguelito
district outside the capital of Panama City.
   In response to questions from local officials about talks with
the United States, Noriega said any discussions must be based on
``respect for the president of the republic, Manuel Solis Palma.''
   ``There cannot be conversation, there cannot be a solution if an
exaggerated number of troops remain on our territory as
psychological aggression,'' Noriega said. ``Neither can there be
any solution as long as the popular forces and a militantly
recognized government are not part of it.''
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said Friday that the vice
president opposes negotiating with Noriega over the conditions
under which Noriega might surrender power.
   ``The administration sources who have suggested that the vice
president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy
back to Washington are essentially correct,'' Fuller said.
   Bush had lunch with President Reagan on Friday, but the vice
president's aides would not say whether they discussed the Noriega
negotiations.
   The official who discussed the tentative deal also said Bush has
recommended that the State Department recall deputy assistant
secretary Michael G. Kozak from Panama. Kozak has spent virtually
all of May in Panama trying to work out an agreement.
   The official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an
Associated Press reporter said, ``If it gets accepted, it gives
Noriega everything he wants.''
   The official said there were no assurances that Noriega was
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the
defense chief has no intention of resigning his post, as the
agreement specifies.
   If the deal receives final approval, the official said Noriega
would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of
authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the
transition government.
   Late Friday, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Kozak was returning to Washington for consultations.
   He said Kozak's return does not mean any change in the process.
   ``The process continues,'' Redman said, declining further
comment.
   Associates of Noriega have said in recent weeks that Noriega
sees Aug. 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the
fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Defense
Forces.
   The State Department view is that dropping the indictments
against Noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in Panama.
   It contends that if Noriega's price for leaving Panama is
dismissal of the indictments, this would be a low cost way of
resolving the 12-week old crisis, which has dropped U.S.-Panamanian
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in Panama.
   According to a published report earlier this week, the United
States would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once
Noriega returns to Panama.
   The Reagan administration has been calling on Noriega to step
down since the indictments were returned on Feb. 5.
   President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega on Feb. 25
but was ousted himself the following day by the pro-Noriega
National Assembly. The United States continues to recognize
Delvalle as the legitimate authority in Panama.
   A series of U.S. economic sanctions have contributed to Panama's
economic demise.
   U.S. apprehensions about Noriega were heightened on Thursday
when a pro-government newspaper published photographs of U.S.
Embassy employees and their families so that Panamanians will
``know the Gringos who are starving us to death.''
   The supplement in the newspaper Critica, a propaganda organ of
the government, said the Americans ``think the walls of their
embassy are impregnable.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the supplement
has been ``noted with concern'' and that appropriate security
measures have been taken.
   He declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any
Americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated.
   ``We have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in
Panama,'' Redman said. ``This appears to be part of that. The way
to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need
to be taken.''
   Redman had no comment on the negotiations. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater also refused comment except to say they were
continuing.

<HEAD>Coast Guard May Back Off Boat Seizure Policy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS two grafs after fourth graf pvs, ``The Atlantis

   The furor over expensive yachts confiscated for as
little as a single marijuana cigarette has led the Coast Guard to
review, but not abandon, the ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy.
   Civil libertarians have attacked the seizures as
unconstitutional, arguing searches are often illegal and owners are
being punished for something done by others.
   U.S. Customs Service Commissioner William Von Raab said Friday
the Atlantis II, which explored the wreck of the Titanic, was the
latest confiscated vessel to be returned to its owners. The ship
was seized in San Diego when a crewman was found with a small
amount of marijuana.
   ``The Atlantis II is being given back because the owners were
perfectly innocent, and they're actually shocked because they were
trying to improve their security,'' said Von Raab.
   The crewman pleaded guilty Thursday to misdemeanor drug
possession and was sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation
and fined $100, said Mike Fleming, a Los Angeles-based Customs
spokesman.
   Under an agreement reached Friday, the Atlantis II will resume
scientific expeditions technically under Customs' control while its
owner, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of Massachusetts,
petitions the seizure, he said.
   Privately, Customs officials have expressed anger at the Coast
Guard's highly publicized aggressive seizures of boats.
   ``They are destroying the program,'' said one Florida Customs
official who spoke on condition of anonymnity.
   In Florida, the Coast Guard boarded and confiscated the $2.5
million Ark Royal, as well as the Monkey Business, notorious as the
Bahamas vacation boat of Gary Hart and Donna Rice and their
friends. Both yachts carried only minute amounts of drugs.
   Under zero tolerance, the Coast Guard is supposed to turn over
all vessels seized for drugs to Customs.
   But Customs refused to take custody of the Monkey Business
because officials felt the search was poorly done. That yacht had
to be returned to its owners by the Coast Guard without fines or
penalties.
   The Coast Guard has now agreed to take another look at such
seizures.
   Specific changes will be implemented ``within a couple of
weeks,'' Capt. John C. Trainor, who heads the Coast Guard's
enforcement division, said Thursday.
   ``We realized that, although the owner is responsible for that
boat, there had to be some reasonableness to it,'' Trainor said.
``We're not in the business of harassing boaters, and we're not in
the business of seizing boats,'' he said.
   Among changes being considered are delaying seizures of charter
vessels until after the boats return to port and drop off their
passengers, employing ``technical seizures'' that allow owners to
keep their vessels while they argue against forfeiture, and
educating Coast Guard officers on exemptions in the zero tolerance
policy.
   But Trainor said the changes don't mean the Coast Guard is
abandoning enforcement of the policy.
   ``We are part of the national effort to stamp out drugs in this
country,'' Trainor said. ``We're holding everybody accountable for
his own actions.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union is conducting a review of its
own, said attorney Barbara Levinson.
   ``From reports I've heard, Coast Guard officers are jumping on
board and not bothering to check safety _ they're going right to a
search. That means people's billfolds, that means drawers, that
means closets,'' she said. ``The search of every nook and cranny
when there's no reasonable cause _ that violates people's
constitutional rights.''

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up Again as Higher Inflation Looms</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf pvs bgng, `The April,' to FIX month to March,
sted May</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big increases in food, energy and clothing
costs sent consumer prices up 0.4 percent in April, an annual rate
of increase of 5.3 percent, as the country got its second monthly
dose of higher inflation, the government reported Friday.
   Inflation, which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six
years, is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight
labor markets, high factory operating rates and a weak dollar,
analysts said.
   The April price increase followed a 0.5 percent March advance,
which had been the sharpest monthly gain since January 1987.
Analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two months is
worrisome because it reflected price increases in a variety of
areas.
   In April, grocery store prices shot up 0.8 percent, the biggest
increase in 20 months, while gasoline costs, which had fallen from
September though February, jumped 1.1 percent.
   Clothing costs, which had surged a record 2 percent in March,
posted another 2 percent rise in April, reflecting higher costs of
imports.
   ``We have an unacceptably high rate of inflation that is
widespread,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
``This is the consequence of both the strength in the economy and
the effect of the weaker dollar on imported goods prices.''
   Seven months after the October stock market crash raised fears
of a recession, analysts have now switched to worrying that the
economy is growing so strongly that inflationary pressures are
building. They cite the fact that factories are now operating at
the highest level in eight years while unemployment has fallen to a
14-year-low of 5.4 percent.
   The Federal Reserve already has boosted interest rates twice in
the past two months in an effort to dampen demand and head off
further inflationary pressures.
   But the tightening has done little to reassure financial
markets, which have been in a tailspin in recent days, driven down
not only by inflation concerns but fears that interest rates will
go higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 6.13 to close at
1,952.59, bringing the loss for the week to 37.95 points as
concerns about inflation and higher interest rates continued to
dominate the market.
   Top Reagan administration officials, including Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, have contended the market's
inflationary fears are overblown.
   In a statement Friday, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said ``inflation remains under control'' with no significant
acceleration from recent years.
   But private economists disagreed. David Jones, an economist with
Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer, predicted
consumer prices would rise by 5.5 percent this year. That would be
the fastest inflation rate since 1981 and up substantially from the
4.4 percent increase in 1987.
   ``The fears that people have had about higher inflation are
justified,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch.
``The general message in this report is that prices have been
rising in the past two months at a faster pace and they will
continue to do so.''
   Steinberg said the Fed will be forced to keep pushing interest
rates higher to fight rising inflationary pressures and that this
eventually will lead to a recession sometime next year. But other
economists said it was too soon to predict a recession from the
upturn in inflation.
   The Labor Department gave these details of its Consumer Price
Index for April:
   _More than one-fourth of the monthly increase came from the 2
percent rise in clothing costs, paced by a 3.5 percent jump in
women's apparel, a 2.7 percent rise in the prices for children's
goods and a 2.1 percent increase in men's clothing.
   _The 0.8 percent rise in grocery store prices, the biggest since
August 1986, reflected higher prices for beef (up 2.3 percent),
fish (up 2.9 percent) and fruits and vegetables (up 1.4 percent).
The higher food costs contributed another one-fourth of the overall
price increase in April.
   _In addition to the 1.1 percent rise in gasoline prices, home
heating oil rose 0.9 percent and natural gas and electricity costs
were up 0.4 percent. Some analysts predicted further gasoline price
increases in May, but they said prices should moderate after that
because of the failure of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to reach agreement with non-member nations to limit
production.
   _New car prices were unchanged in April, but the cost of public
transportation jumped 0.8 percent, reflecting higher airline ticket
prices.
   The various increases left the consumer price index at 117.1,
meaning a market basket of consumer goods costing $10.00 on average
between 1982 and 1984, cost $11.71 last month.
   The Labor Department said in another report Friday that
Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,
rose 0.9 percent in April as the 0.4 percent rise in inflation was
offset by increases in hourly pay and number of hours worked.
   The changes left Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings 0.3
percent above a year ago.
   In other economic news Friday:
   _Income tax collections helped shrink the federal budget deficit
by $13.9 billion in April, but the deficit for the first seven
months of the fiscal year, $105.0 billion, was running 24.6 percent
ahead of last year. Economists said the Reagan administration would
have difficulty meeting its deficit projection for 1988 of $146.7
billion.
   _The Veterans Administration announced that effective Monday it
was increasing the maximum interest rate on federally-backed VA
home mortgages by 0.5 percentage points to 10.5 percent.
   _Average rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages
increased to 10.52 percent this week, up from 10.40 percent last
week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said.

   U.N. Undersecretary-General Diego
Cordovez, the diplomat who helped negotiate the Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan, was named Ecuador's next foreign minister on
Friday by President-elect Rodrigo Borja.
   Borja told reporters that Cordovez had accepted the Cabinet post
and would take up his new position when Borja takes office in
August. Cordovez, 52, has served since 1981 as the U.N. official in
charge of special political matters.
   Borja, of the Democratic Left Party, was elected president on
May 8. He said one of Cordovez's first jobs will be to help restore
diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.
   Outgoing President Leon Febres Cordero, a conservative, cut ties
with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government in late 1985
following an argument with President Daniel Ortega.
   Cordovez has served at the United Nations since 1963.
   ``The management of international policy could not be in better
hands,'' Borja said of the diplomat.
   Cordovez arrived Thursday night in Quito to discuss the offer.

   A woman opened fire in an elementary
school, killing one child and critically wounding five others
Friday. She was found dead when a SWAT team stormed a house where
she had wounded a seventh person.
   ``I've just received information that the suspect has been found
and she is dead,'' Police Chief Herbert Timm said about 7:30 CDT.
   ``The situation is over. I don't have any information about how
she died. She has been found in the home, and she is dead. There
have been no other injuries,'' Timm said.
   The woman, identified as Lori Dann, 30, was carrying at least
two handguns when she opened fire in a classroom of the one-story,
red-brick Hubbard Woodsk Elementary School, killing a child and
wounding five others.
   A hostage negotiating team arrived at the house moments after
the woman took it over around 11:30 a.m, Timm said. Ms. Dann spoke
by telephone to her parents, who were brought to the house in hopes
of talking her out.
   Asked why police had not attempted to storm the house earlier,
Timm replied, ``We've had seven people shot already. We're not
going in there without taking every precaution.''
   Timm said he decided to send the SWAT team into the house after
repeated efforts by police and Ms. Dann's parents failed to contact
her.
   He said the SWAT team was accompanied by FBI agents using
sound-detecting devices to try to detect any movement in the house.
   Timm said police had yet to establish a motive for the rampage.
   ``There was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked
over'' as the children panicked during the 15 minutes the shooting
lasted, said Glencoe Patrolman John Ceglieski.
   ``Kids were lying around in very serious condition,'' in the
one-story, red-brick Hubbard Woods Elementary School, Timm said.
``Kids were hiding under the desk as well as well as they could.''
   Police believe she had set fire earlier in the day to another
home eight blocks away where she worked as a housekeeper in this
affluent North Shore suburb of Chicago, said Wilmette Sgt. Michael
Geier.
   
   The FBI said it had ``an investigative interest'' in Ms. Dann
and Madison, Wis., police Lt. William Sprague said she had been
arrested there March 14 on a charge of retail theft. He gave no
further details.
   Keith Wilson told the Wisconsin State Journal from his home in
Los Angeles that he had roomed across the hall from Ms. Dann when
they attended the University of Wisconsin. He described her as
``just an absolutely bizarre lady'' and said ``sometimes she'd
wander the halls and try to open doors.''
   Timm, the police chief, said when the woman walked into the
school around 10:45 a.m., her first stop was a boys' bathroom,
where she shot a youngster.
   ``She left him and ran into one classroom, telling the teacher
there that a boy had been wounded,'' said Timm. ``Then she entered
a second classroom, announced she had a gun and opened fire.''
   Police recovered a .32-caliber handgun from the school bathroom
and the woman was believed to also have carried a .22-caliber gun
and a third, unidentified weapon, according to Sumner.
   Sumner said the woman then ran through the woods from the school
and entered the home, where four members of a family and their maid
were present.
   ``Apparently, she just walked in and confronted the
homeowners,'' Sumner said. ``The mother came running out and said,
`There's a woman in my home with a gun.'
   ``Then we heard a shot. The son came out, holding a gun, and
fell over in the driveway,'' Sumner said.
   The son apparently struggled with the suspect, grabbed one of
her weapons, and was shot in the chest, Sumner said. The father,
maid and grandfather fled by side door, leaving the suspect alone
inside, Sumner said.
   He said he believed the woman had three weapons and police had
recovered two of them.
   Geier said the suspect was believed to have set fire to the home
where she worked while a mother and her children were in the
basement doing laundry.
   ``This woman set a fire in the house, trapping the people in the
basement,'' he said. ``They escaped, got out, apparently without
serious injury.''
   Timm also said Ms. Dann apparently had planted a number of
incendiary devices in North Shore communities. He said some devices
were found in her car in the neighborhood near the house, but he
refused to elaborate. Timm refused to say exactly what the devices
were and did not say whether they were planted or found Friday. The
fire at the house where she worked was caused by one of the
devices, he said.
   Eight-year-old Nick Corwin died of his wounds at Highland Park
Hospital, said spokesman Mark Newtwon.
   Another 8-year-old boy and the 22-year-old man shot at his home
were in critical condition at the hospital, said spokeswoman Sue
Masaracchia.
   The four children at Evanston Hospital were reported in critical
but stable condition with gunshot wounds following surgery, said
spokeswoman Mary Ash. They were identified as Mark Tebourek, 8,
Robert Trossman, 6, Lindsay Fisher, 8, and Kathryn Ann Miller, 7,
said another spokeswoman, Cheryl Soohoo.
   At the school, meanwhile, parents clustered in groups, consoling
each other. Village Manager Robert Buechner said children were
released in small groups throughout the afternoon to ensure their
safety.

   A western cold front spawned thunderstorms, high winds and hail
over most of the Great Plains and central United States Friday,
while the rain-saturated East Coast got still more precipitation.
   Severe thunderstorms blanketed the Great Plains, with clusters
of showers over central Texas, northern Oklahoma and southern
Kansas, as well as eastern Nebraska to southwest Minnesota.
   Residents in Hobbs, N.M., reported seeing two tornadoes touch
down Friday. One twister tore part of the roof and a side from a
building, uprooted trees, knocked down telephone poles and
overturned a pickup truck, slightly injuring the driver. The second
tornado destroyed an unoccupied mobile home, and tore off parts of
the roofs of two houses, a witness said.
   The storm system brought golf ball-sized hail at Hunt and
Kerrville, Texas, and marble-sized hail near El Dorado, Kan.
   Showers over the central High Plains and southern and central
Rockies were accompanied by blustery north winds gusting to 40 mph,
sending the mercury plunging into the 40s and 50s.
   Rain and drizzly weather continued in the Northeast, with severe
storms stretching from Maryland to eastern North Carolina during
the afternoon and evening.
   In Pennsylvania, where 8 inches of rain have fallen in parts of
the state since Monday, a 16-year-old youth drowned Thursday night
while rafting with some friends on a rain-swollen creek in
Fayetteville, state police said.
   The heavy rains have caused creeks and streams to overflow, as
well as minor flooding in low-lying areas.
   Southwestern and eastern Pennsylvania, parts of eastern New York
state, northern and western New Jersey, northern Delaware, northern
and central Maryland, northern Virginia and the eastern Panhandle
of West Virginia had all issued flood watches through the evening.
   Sunny skies prevailed west of the Rockies and in the Southeast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Limon, Colo., to 100 at Palm Springs, Calif. The morning
low for the nation was 19 degrees in West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Saturday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms
stretching from New England to the upper Ohio Valley, Virginia and
eastern North Carolina and from the southern Plains throughout the
central Plains and the lower Missouri Valley to the upper
Mississippi Valley, with rain heaviest over Oklahoma and northwest
Texas. Sunny skies were predicted for the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures should remain below 70 in the central High
Plains and the central Rockies, with highs only in the 50s in
eastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming, and in the 60s in
northern Minnesota, as well as southern and eastern New England.
Highs should rise into the 80s west of the Rockies and in the South
Atlantic Coast, reaching into the 90s from southern Arizona through
southern Nevada and western California into southwestern Oregon,
topping 100 in desert areas of California and Arizona.

<HEAD>Banks Are Asked to Waive Debtor Countries' Interest Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank suggested Friday that
commercial banks in the United States and other countries
voluntarily give up $5 billion to $6 billion of interest owed them
by 17 heavily indebted countries.
   In a special report, the bank, which is owned by 151
governments, said interest waivers of about two percentage points
on the debt owed by the so-called ``middle income countries'' would
generate the same financial relief in the first year as a $5
billion to $6 billion loan.
   The ``middle income countries'' in question are Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Ivory Coast,
Jamaica, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Uruguay,
Venezuela and Yugoslavia. They have foreign debts of about $500
billion.
   The 42-page report, ``The World Bank and the Heavily Indebted
Middle-Income Countries,'' did not say how long the waivers should
be continued.
   The same suggestion was made privately last month by Barber B.
Conable, the bank's president, to representatives of member
countries.
   Conable and government financial leaders including Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, have criticized commercial banks for
not lending more.
   The commercial banks, meanwhile, say governments and
intergovernmental bodies like the World Bank and its sister body,
the International Monetary Fund, should do more lending.
   The report said governments of borrowing countries are reluctant
to borrow more without some relief. They complain they are already
paying out $30 billion a year to more prosperous countries, mostly
on old debt.
   ``In many of these countries, per capita income and consumption
have fallen considerably over the past five years and are for some
countries back to levels that were already attained in the early
1960s,'' according to the report.
   The average Argentine earned $2,350 in 1986, compared with $160
for the average Nepalese, $17,840 for the average Swiss and $17,500
for the average American, according to the World Bank's figures.
   The report cites Mexico, where 700,000 teen-agers reach working
age every year and few jobs have been created since 1981.
Unemployment in Mexico increased by 70 percent between 1981 and
1984, it says.
   The World Bank is the largest source of aid money to nearly 120
countries, lending about $17 billion annually. That figure is
expected to increase to more than $20 billion in the 1990s.

   A 2-week-old American Airlines jet made
an emergency landing in Bermuda last week after a leak spewed fuel
into the Atlantic Ocean, officials said Friday.
   No injuries were reported when the twin-engine jet, a wide-body
Airbus A300-600R, landed with one engine operating after losing
fuel through a crack in the right engine, American spokesman Steve
McGregor said.
   The flight was en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport with 90 passengers aboard on May 10,
when a fuel pump split in the right engine, he said.
   The pilot tried to stop fuel flowing to the damaged pump, but
the shut-off valve was beyond the crack. He then released
fire-extinguisher bottles in the engine to shut it down and
diverted to Bermuda, McGregor said.
   He said the jet did not run out of fuel and added that
authorities have not determined the cause of the split.
   After the incident, repairmen from General Electric _ which
manufactures the plane's engines _ flew people to Bermuda to fix
the pump, said David Venz, spokesman for Airbus Industrie of North
America Inc. of Herndon, Va.
   The plane was then flown back to New York and put back into
service the next day, McGregor said.
   Venz said the 267-person-capacity jet, designed so it can
operate on just one engine if necessary, was delivered to American
two weeks prior to the incident.

<HEAD>Police Can Now Wiretap Telephones of Suspected Drug Dealers Under
New Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian signed a law Friday
permitting state law enforcement officers to wiretap suspected big
time drug dealers, but officials said the bill won't add much punch
to the war against drug-dealing street gangs.
   The law is a long-sought, if partial, victory for police and
conservatives, who spent decades seeking far broader powers to
conduct electronic surveillance.
   Outrage over drug-related gang violence overrode concerns about
privacy and helped win passage of the bill, but some officials said
the powers are too weak to be of much use against gangs.
   Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates said most gangs don't deal
in large enough quantities of drugs to trigger wiretapping.
   ``If you're able to use it extensively for gangs, it would give
law enforcement an insight into the structure of gangs,'' Gates
said. ``They are very smart; much smarter than our legislators,
unfortunately.''
   Gates also criticized the bill because it only applies to drug
crimes.
   ``It should be used for murders, kidnappings and terrorists.
(But) we're only using it for narcotics,'' he said, adding that
federal investigators can use wiretaps to investigate a greater
array of crimes.
   Beginning Jan. 1, state and local law enforcement agencies may
tap telephones in drug cases involving at least 10 gallons or three
pounds of heroin, cocaine, PCP or methamphetamine.
   Police must obtain permission to tap from a Superior Court
judge. Officers conducting taps would have to go through special
training, could not enter a private residence covertly to install a
listening device and would have to report to the judge every 72
hours on the progress of the tap.
   Unauthorized use of information obtained through a wiretap could
result in a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment.
   ``The bill is not as strong as we'd like it to be. However, it
is going to be an effective tool,'' Deukmejian said in signing the
law at the Hall of Justice.
   ``This is not a panacea that will end all the drug abuse in
California, but it's a small tool we can use,'' said Grover Trask,
the Riverside County district attorney and president of the
California District Attorney's Association.
   Under the federal wiretapping law adopted in 1968, federal
investigators can use electronic surveillance in certain murder
cases, such as political assassinations and murders-for-hire, drug
cases, and other suspected crimes such as bribery, racketeering,
treason and sexual exploitation of children, said Jim Sander,
assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles.
   There are no quantity limitations on the drug cases that can be
investigated, he added.
   The state Senate has approved wiretap legislation several times
since 1970, but all previous attempts died in the Assembly. Many
legislators and the American Civil Liberties Union have opposed
wiretapping as an invasion of privacy.
   But aided by the rising concern over gang activities, a
coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats this year
pushed the proposal around a committee that has blocked previous
efforts in the lower house. The bill was approved by votes of 31-3
in the Senate and 49-19 in the Assembly.
   ACLU officials did not return phone calls Friday.

<HEAD>Reports Military Considered Crackdown in Slovenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official statement issued Friday
confirmed that federal military commanders met in March and
considered ways to quell dissent in Slovenia.
   The statement by Slovenia's Information Ministry followed
reports published by the Slovenian youth magazine Mladina that
there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic.
   Slovenia is considered the most liberal of Yugoslavia's six
republics and two autonomous provinces.
   The ministry statement said the federal military council met on
March 25 and concluded that ``dissident tendencies'' in Slovenia
were part of a foreign-backed conspiracy to overthrow the country's
Communist government.
   But it said there was no discussion at the meeting ``about a
plan for action against special warfare in Slovenia.'' The term
special warfare refers to subversive actions.
   The statement did not identify the foreign elements and said
Slovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such a
conspiracy.
   It said the police disputed the military council's conclusion at
a later meeting between the republic's police authorities and
Ljubljana's military command.
   The police said ``they had no available data which would justify
such evaluations,'' according to the ministry statement. It
reported the police also said there were no ``subversive forces
behind'' articles carried in the Slovenian news media.
   Slovenia's Communist Party presidium also ``expressed
disagreement with part of the military council's opinions,'' said
the statement.
   Some army commanders have been increasingly critical of
Slovenia's leadership, saying it should act firmly against
political dissidents. And Slovenian Communists have frequently
criticized the way the federal government is dealing with the
country's economic and social problems.
   Mladina, the official publication of the Socialist Youth
organization, wrote of possible military intervention in its
current issue.
   It published a letter to Slovenia's Communist Party leader Milan
Kucan from two student unions that said military action had been
planned earlier this year, including the arrests of ``nonconformist
journalists, writers and officials.''
   The letter said military units would be used to crush
demonstrations that were expected to be called to protest the
arrests.
   It also said the army did not notify Slovenia's civilian
leadership of the planned intervention. The plan was blocked by
Kucan and Stane Dolanc, Slovenia's member in Yugoslavia's
collective presidency, after they were told about it by Slovenian
security organizations, the letter said.
   Svetozar Visnjic, commander of Ljubljana's military command,
dismissed the reports of planned military action as ``nonsense and
a fabrication.'' He made the comment in an interview with the
Belgrade Politika Ekspres newspaper.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday temporarily
blocked Reagan administration plans to start random drug testing of
all 13,000 federal prison workers, saying the testing of
``law-abiding employees'' posed constitutional problems.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel issued a temporary
restraining order sought by a labor union against the Bureau of
Prisons, one of the first federal agencies scheduled to begin drug
testing under President Reagan's September 1986 executive order.
   ``The program would force law-abiding employees of the Bureau of
Prisons to submit to testing even though not suspected of any
wrongdoing, negligence or dereliction of duty,'' Weigel said in his
order.
   The 750,000-member American Federation of Government Employees,
the largest union representing federal workers, also has challenged
Reagan's entire drug testing program, covering 345,000 employees in
40 agencies, in a separate lawsuit.
   The union chose the federal court in San Francisco for both
suits because of favorable precedents from the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which has ruled against post-accident testing of
railroad workers.
   The Supreme Court may resolve the issue in a case scheduled for
argument this fall involving the testing of applicants for jobs and
promotions in the Customs Service.
   Weigel's order blocks testing of prison workers, which had been
set to start Monday, until at least next Thursday, when a hearing
is scheduled on a longer-lasting preliminary injunction. The
injunction, if granted, could be appealed to higher courts.
   Weigel pressed a government lawyer, apparently without success,
to bypass the preliminary injunction hearing and allow the ban to
stay in effect until a full-scale trial of the lawsuit June 16.
   ``I don't think the world's going to come to an end because the
program is delayed until a full, careful consideration,'' the judge
said.
   But Justice Department lawyer Richard Lepley said the government
was unwilling to let the temporary ban, which cannot be appealed,
stay in effect longer than the 20-day legal limit for restraining
orders.
   At a hearing Thursday, Lepley said the Bureau of Prisons had
concluded that even a few days' delay in testing ``would cause a
great chance of serious injury, even death.'' Both Weigel and a
union lawyer questioned that claim.
   Under Reagan's 1986 order, federal agencies are to conduct
random urinalysis testing of employees in ``sensitive'' jobs, and
also test applicants for new jobs and promotions, workers involved
in accidents, and supervisors. Workers who fail the tests can be
fired if they decline rehabilitation and lesser discipline.
   The Bureau of Prisons has declared that all its employees hold
``sensitive'' jobs and therefore are subject to random testing,
with 5 to 10 percent of the staff tested each year.
   The AFGE suit contends the program violates constitutional
standards for unreasonable searches by allowing testing without
individual suspicion of drug use. The suit also claims violations
of federal laws forbidding discrimination against the handicapped
and requiring employee discipline to be related to job performance.
   In his order, Weigel said Supreme Court and appellate rulings
``cast serious doubt upon the constitutionality and lawfulness'' of
the program.
   The judge said his order does not prohibit testing of any prison
employee based on a reasonable suspicion of drug use that impairs
job performance. That is the standard the government has been
following since 1985, Lepley said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Egypt's foreign minister
Friday that any Middle East peace settlement has to take both
Palestinian and Israeli interests into account.
   The Soviet leader reiterated in his talks with Foreign Minister
Esmat Abdel-Meguid the comments he made at a meeting last month
with Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat.
   ``Without the PLO's involvement the process of a settlement will
not go forward,'' Gorbachev said according to a report published by
the official Tass news agency.
   ``But it is no less important to take account of the interests
of other sides, namely Syria, Jordan and Israel,'' Tass quoted him
as saying. ``The present situation opens up opportunities to
convene an international conference under the U.N. aegis. These
opportunities should not be missed.''
   Gorbachev offered much the same formula at his April 9 meeting
with Arafat.
   The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war but recently has moved to improve relations with
the Jewish state.

<DATELINE>SAN MIGUELITO, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega said Friday that talks between Panama and the United States
cannot be held ``if the aggression continues.''
   Noriega told thousands of supporters in the San Miguelito
district outside the capital that: ``There cannot be conversation
if aggression continues, aggression at whatever level, whatever
magnitude, whether it be psychological or economic aggression.''
   He made no reference to reports in Washington that U.S. and
Panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal calling
for Noriega to leave Panama in August and stay away until May 1989
when presidential elections will be held.
   A Reagan administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told reporters that in return for Noriega's departure,
the United States would agree to drop federal drug smuggling
charges against him and give him a role in setting up a
transitional government.
   The agreement, subject to final approval by both governments,
allows Noriega to return to Panama for holidays and to go back
permanently after the presidential elections, the official said.
   Noriega, in response to questions from local officials about
talks with the United States, said any discussions must be based on
``respect for the president of the republic, Manuel Solis Palma.''
   ``There cannot be conversation, there cannot be a solution if an
exaggerated number of troops remain on our territory as
psychological aggression,'' he said.
   ``Neither can there be any solution as long as the popular
forces and a militantly recognized government are not part of it,''
he said at the inauguration of a grandstand at a sports complex in
San Miguelito.
   Noriega, as head of the 15,000-member Panamanian Defense Forces,
is the power behind the civilian government.
   The Reagan administration has imposed sweeping economic
sanctions against the country in an effort to force Noriega's
ouster.
   The United States still recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle, who has
been in hiding, as Panama's legitimate president. Noriega allies in
the National Assembly dismissed him Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle
tried to fire Noriega.
   There are about 10,000 U.S. military personnel stationed at 10
installations in Panama.
   Noriega said Panama is a democratic country but it is a
democracy, ``without the U.S.A. label, democracy with the
Panamanian tricolor, with the taste of Panamanian soup and with the
tone and the tune of the little drum.''
   Arrayed on the field before Noriega were hundreds of members of
so-called Dignity Battalions. The volunteer battalions have been
formed to confront what the Noriega-controlled government says is
the danger of a U.S. invasion.
   About 30 volunteers, clad in T-shirts and blue jeans and
carrying World War II-era rifles, ran through an obstacle course,
then jabbed or battered a dummy dressed in olive green as a
demonstration of their training.
   ``San Miguelito will be the tomb of Yankee imperialism,'' said
an announcer through loudspeakers as the volunteers went through
their paces.
   Noriega said the militias would fight any invaders.
   ``Those powerful ones who think they can come to this territory
without getting a whipping are mistaken,'' he said.
   The master of ceremonies who introduced the general addressed
himself to the foreign journalists gathered below him.
   ``If there is an invasion, you won't be filming Panamanian
cadavers, but the cadavers of North American soldiers that we will
send home to North American mothers,'' he said.
   Noriega concluded the list of conditions for a U.S.-Panama
solution by saying, ``If I have said nothing, it is because I know
them (the Americans), and because I know them, I remain silent.''

<TEXT>
   Acting Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
won approval Friday to form a new government after two other
leaders failed during a political crisis over NATO and the
country's ban on nuclear weapons.
   Schleuter had hoped for a clear mandate from May 10
parliamentary elections for full Danish participation in NATO and
against a stronger anti-nuclear ban.
   However, Schlueter's center-right coalition merely kept its 70
seats in the 179-member legislature. The two-party socialist
opposition lost ground but still holds 79 seats, making it
difficult for Schlueter to form a new government.
   Schleuter, now caretaker prime minister, was asked to try to
form a new government by Queen Margrethe II.
   ``It's a hard task and far from certain that I will succeed,''
said Schlueter on Friday.
   The socialist opposition pushed a resolution through Parliament
April 14 calling on Schlueter's government to notify each visiting
warship of Denmark's longstanding peacetime ban on nuclear weapons.
   
   Schleuter said he hoped a new government would be in place for
the opening of Parliament on Thursday.
   The non-partisan chairman of Parliament and the leader of the
centrist Social-Liberal Party both failed to forge a ruling
coalition among the eight parties elected to the legislature on May
10.

   An 84-year-old woman trapped 10 days in her
bathtub after a fall was in critical condition Friday after being
rescued, police said.
   Ariadna Lohmann was in the critical care unit of Midway Hospital

   Sgt. Al Pesanti said the woman suffered a broken leg.
   Neighbors became concerned whennewspapers and mail began to pile
up outside Lohmann's home. They summoned police Thursday night.
   Officers found lights on and a radio playing, but got no
response when they knocked on the door at 8:45 p.m. They kicked the
door in and found the woman lying on her left side in the tub,
which contained no water, Sgt. Len Hundshamer said.
   ``She was very weak and dehydrated. She could talk weakly to
officers,'' Pesanti said.
   ``Police have been to her house in the past. She has fallen down
and can't get up,'' Pesanti said. ``She's kind of heavyset,'' he
said.

   The government Friday arrested 20

   It was the biggest sweep since President Joseph Momoh declared a

   Most of the 20 were in custody Friday night and officials said
they would be formally charged in High Court.
   Officials said the charges mainly involve forged government
documents which led to the payment of millions of leones, the local

given of the alleged criminal actions. Among those arrested were
Peter Kuyembeh, the financial secretary in the Finance Ministry;

<HEAD>Demonstration Reported in Port City of St. Marc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A protest against a customs
officer's arrival in the port city of St. Marc turned into an
anti-government demonstration by more than 5,000 Haitians on
Friday, the Radio Metropole station reported.
   It was one of the first demonstrations reported in Haiti against
the government of Leslie Manigat since he was elected president in
January.
   The station said hundreds of protesters took to the streets
after learning that a customs officer arrived in St. Marc to
enforce a government order to stop illegal entry of imported goods
into this Caribbean island country.
   The officer ordered a halt to the unloading of cargo ships in
St. Marc harbor, about 55 miles northwest of the capital city of
Port-au-Prince.
   Demonstrators first turned their wrath on the unidentified
customs officer.
   Armed with machetes, sticks, knives and stones, they set up
flaming tire barricades and shouted, ``I am going to eat you! I am
going to devour you!,'' the station said.
   Two hours later, the number of protesters swelled to about 5,000
and they turned on the government, shouting, ``Down with
Manigat!,'' Radio Metropole reported.
   No injuries were reported.
   Manigat earlier announced he intended to stop the illegal flow
of goods into Haiti that has flourished since former
President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into French exile Feb.
7, 1986.
   The president said his program was aimed at stabilizing the
economy of Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.
Although figures have never made public, the contraband helped
drive down prices in Haiti but cut into government tax revenue.
   Contraband brought to Haiti comes mostly on ships from Miami and
includes second-hand clothing, canned food, cigarettes, rice, and
other consumer goods.
   Since then, port cities have been the focal point of the
government plan.
   Goods valued at $250,000 were confiscated at Miragoane, a port
city 50 miles west of Port-of-Prince. Imported passenger cars were
held at other ports until import duties were paid.
   Radio Haiti-Inter reported two weeks ago that the military
stopped merchants from taking possession of goods at the port of
Cap Haitien on the north coast.

<TEXT>
   The Eagan family was horrified when they
saw a stranger in the casket at a Hamden funeral home and found out
that the man they came to mourn had been cremated by mistake, a
newspaper reported Friday.
   Thomas P. Eagan, 68, of North Haven, died May 9, as did William
J. Gormley, 73, of East Haven. Both men were taken first to the
morgue at Yale-New Haven Hospital and then to separate branches of
Sisk Brothers funeral homes in New Haven and Hamden, a town about 8
miles to the north, the New Haven Register reported.
   Eagan was to have been buried May 13 but instead was cremated.
Gormley was to have been cremated, but his body appeared dressed in
Eagan's suit in an open coffin May 12 during calling hours at the
funeral home in Hamden, according to the newspaper.
   The Eagans Thursday filed a complaint against the funeral home
with the state Department of Health Services and has hired an
investigator to find out who made the error, the newspaper reported.
   ``There had to be an extremely large number of mistakes made in
order for this to have happened,'' Thomas P. Eagan Jr. of North
Branford, one of Eagan's three sons, was quoted as saying.
   ``I would never want another family to have to go through this.''
   Patrick Sisk, one of the funeral home's owners, blamed Yale-New
Haven Hospital and said his attorney was preparing to file a
complaint against the hospital, the newspaper reported.
   ``The tags were wrong,'' he was quoted as saying. ``They
released the wrong bodies to us.''
   But Thomas Urtz, a hospital spokesman, said Friday that the
mixup had to have occurred at the funeral home.
   ``One was taken to the morgue five hours before the other man
arrived in the emergency room. These individuals went to the morgue
properly tagged and were properly identified,'' he said.
   A state medical examiner, Audrey Goldstein, had signed a
certificate which had allowed Eagan's unintended cremation, the
newspaper reported.
   Gormley's daughter-in-law, Karen Gormley, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying that the funeral home did not tell her family
what had happened and only asked that a relative identify Gormley's
body on May 13.
   Karen Gormley said her husband found it strange that Gormley's
body was dressed in a stranger's suit. ``We didn't know where the
suit came from. No one had sent it,'' she was quoted as saying.
   The Eagans' attorney, Thomas W. Boyce Jr., said Thursday he did
not know who was responsible for the mistake but filed a complaint
against the funeral home because ``they're the ones that ultimately
made the arrangements.''
   Eagan's cremated remains were placed in a casket on May 13 by
Keenan Funeral Home, which replaced Sisk brothers at the family's
request, and were buried after a funeral mass, the newspaper
reported.
   Gormley was cremated and a memorial service for him was held at
Sisk Brothers, the newspaper reported.

   A hospital worker winced and shut his eyes
at the pain of a young, bloodied shooting victim in Evanston
Hospital's emergency room, as the little victims of a schoolhouse
shooting began arriving Friday.
   ``It was a big trauma. Everybody was running around,'' said
Adrian Hatter, a supply technician who was in the emergency room
when ambulance drivers said they were coming from the school in
Winnetka with four children, victims of the shooting. Both cities
are affluent northern suburbs of Chicago.
   ``It kind of affected me because I've got kids of my own,''
Hatter, 26, said.
   He said he was especially moved by a young blonde girl who was
shot in the wrist and chest.
   ``She looked like she was fighting for her life; she was rolling
back and forth on the cart,'' Hatter said. ``I had to close my eyes
a couple times and listen for my next orders.''
   Parents of the wounded children were secluded in a room to await
word and to avoid reporters.
   ``In view of these circumstances, they are doing remarkably
well,'' Dr. David Winchester, a surgeon who operated on some of the
children, said of the parents.
   The four children _ Mark Tebourek, 8, Robert Trossman, 6,
Lindsay Fisher, 8, and Kathryn Miller, 7 _ were in critical
condition with neck and chest wounds, said hospital spokeswoman
Cheryl Soohoo.
   ``It was like a zoo,'' said Tyrone Harris, 31, a nursing
assistant at Evanston Hospital. ``At first, people were running
everywhere. We had regular cases scheduled but we had to cancel
them to make room for the patients who came in from the shooting.''
   Police said a woman armed with at least three guns walked into
the Hubbard Woods Elementary School. Two other children were rushed
to Highland Park Hospital where one 8-year-old boy died. A seventh
person was shot at a home were the woman fled from the school.
   Police stormed the Winnetka house Friday evening and found the
woman, identified as Lori Dann, dead of a single gunshot wound to
the head.

<TEXT>
   The U.S-backed Contras agreed Friday
to Nicaragua's proposed dates for the next round of peace talks,
but the two sides suggested different sites.
   Jorge Rosales, spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, said in
a phone interview from Miami that leaders of the Contra rebels will
attend two days of peace talks beginning Wednesday, as the
government has proposed.
   He said the rebel leaders will arrive for talks at the border
town of Sapoa, where the agreement was reached in March for a
60-day cease-fire lasting until May 30.
   But Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said in a note to
the rebels that the talks must be held in Managua.
   To hold the discussions outside of the capital, he said, ``is to
go back in the advances that, with great difficulties, have been
achieved'' in the cease-fire talks.
   Tinoco said earlier that the rebels had not yet responded to a
government proposal to extend the cease-fire one month past the May
30 deadline.
   The Interior Ministry, meanwhile, ordered Radio Catolica to pull
off the air until Tuesday a news program that carried an interview
with a rebel chief, according to Auxiliadora Echegoyen, director of
the program.
   She said the suspension notice cited ``an interview which we
transmitted with a rebel chief, whose pseudonym is Tigrillo, and
which we monitored from another radio.''
   She did not say which station had originally carried the
interview.
   The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the station
should have cleared the interview with the government.
   Radio Catolica, which is operated by the Roman Catholic Church,
was one of three privately owned radio stations barred from
broadcasting news programs earlier this month because it reported a
workers' strike.
   The Sandinista government and the Contras have been blaiming
each other for the faltering peace plan to end more than six years
of war.
   Almost two months after the two sides signed the pact, they
agree only on the desire to end the fighting. The government has
warned it will stage the largest offensive to date if the
cease-fire is not extended after May 30 or if no progress is made.
   The Contras, meanwhile, are suffering from infighting, a move
that favors the ruling Sandinistas. From the government's point of
view, the best way for the war to end would be for the enemy to
self-destruct.
   Pro-Sandinista newspapers were giving widespread coverage to the
Contra bickering.
   The problems surrounding the cease-fire plan appear to have
started almost immediately after the March 23 signing. If all had
gone according to plan, the war would just about be over and
Nicaragua would be well on its way to full democracy.
   Because the cease-fire plan has not moved forward, the
Sandinistas have not freed more than 3,000 political prisoners nor
permitted the Contras to have a say in internal politics.
   Talks with the internal opposition political parties stand at an
impasse. The meetings were suspended by the opposition as a show of
support for the strikers. The government responded by saying it
would consider whether future talks would be held.
   According to the cease-fire plan, the first measures should have
been completed by April 15. In exchange, the Contra rebels would
have gathered in agreed upon cease-fire zones and been permitted to
receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization.
   The Sandinistas have said the insurgents could now receive food,
medicine and clothes distributed by the International Red Cross.
But the Contras rejected that, saying the organization sympathizes
with the government.
   Meanwhile, sources said thousands of rebel troops moved toward
the northern border. The U.S. Agency for International Development
is providing supplies to the Contras through Honduras.
   A group of rebellious Contras has demanded the ouster of the top
Contra military officer, Col. Enrique Bermudez, a former officer
under the ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Matamoros, the Contras' main spokesman, said recently the talk
of divisions was exaggerated.
   Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez said Sunday that the
Contra infighting puts into doubt future cease-fire negotiations.
   ``In Honduras the mercenary forces (the Contras) are on the
verge of civil war,'' he said. ``The political heads that come here
to negotiate have very little influence.''

   The prosecutor responsible for
convicting reputed cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas says the
powerful Medellin Cartel's days are now numbered, but a defense
lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned.
   Lehder was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons
of cocaine into the United States. Authorities say the 38-year-old
Colombian was a key figure in the cartel, a violent drug ring
responsible for about 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports.
   The flamboyant Lehder, described by witnesses as a one-time New
York City street hood, was characterized by U.S. Attorney Robert W.
Merkle, chief prosecutor in the case, as the most important drug
smuggler brought to trial in the United States.
   The verdict capped a seven-month trial on an 11-count federal
indictment charging him with taking over the island of Norman's Cay
in the Bahamas to smuggle cocaine into Florida and Georgia from
1978 to 1980.

   Trade ministers from leading industrialized
countries have set the stage for what some say will be a crucial
year-end showdown over a call by the United States to end public
subsidies to the world's farmers.
   Wrapping up two days of talks on world economic issues, the
ministers agreed Thursday to work for ``tangible progress'' in
liberalizing global trade in agriculture and other fields.
   Such liberalization is generally considered a key step for
ensuring the long-term health of the world economy. The aim is to
suppress tendencies in some nations, including the United States,
to shield domestic industries from foreign competition.
   The Paris meeting brought together trade and finance ministers
from the 24 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation

   Faddish ``one-shot'' strategies for quitting
smoking, such as sensory deprivation and injections, usually won't
hack it alone, says a survey that concludes the best course is
getting a doctor's advice and support from others.
   The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed 39 studies of
stop-smoking techniques. They ranged from the ``one-shot''
strategies to combinations of techniques like physician counseling,
nicotine gum and behavioral therapy.
   ``Success was not associated with novel or unusual
interventions,'' the research team reports in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Rather than quick fixes, the best way to stop smoking is through
direct counseling from physicians and other experts, as well as the
use of stop-smoking groups, booklets and self-help tapes, says a
co-author of the report, Dr. Thomas E. Kottke of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.

   Amid growing pressure from Republican leaders
to speed action, the Senate on Friday crushed a bid by the GOP's
right wing to tie the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty to
ending Kremlin cheating on other arms control accords.
   All five sections of the amendment offered by Sen. Steve Symms,
R-Idaho, were overwhelmingly rejected in back-to-back roll call
votes of 85-11, 87-10, 86-11, 82-15 and 89-8.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas repeatedly urged his
GOP colleagues to ``start making real progress'' on the treaty so
President Reagan can take a ratified agreement with him when he
leaves on Wednesday for his May 29 Moscow summit meeting with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   The Reagan administration's plan to give cash
to the Contra rebels inside Nicaragua is ``a last resort'' aimed at
feeding the starving remnants of the guerrilla force, the head of
the U.S. foreign aid program said Friday.
   ``There are people inside Nicaragua who are desperate ... we've
had reports of people eating tree roots,'' Alan Woods,
administrator of the Agency for International Development, told a
Senate subcommittee.
   Woods said AID plans to send cash at the rate of $1 per day per
rebel, but is still working out the details.
   A March 23 agreement between the Contras and Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government permits humanitarian aid to be sent to the
rebels while the two sides hold peace talks. But a dispute over how
the aid should be delivered has meant no help has yet been sent,
and the State Department came up with the cash plan as a
substitute, Woods said.

walked through five galleries to reach the room where the works
were hanging, he said.
   Stolen were ``Carnations,'' an 1888 work by the Dutch painter
Van Gogh; ``Bottle with Apples,'' a still life painted in 1894 by

   The cocaine-smuggling conviction of Carlos Lehder
Rivas has heartened the front line in the drug war, but officials
acknowledged Friday they are far from destroying the violent
Medellin drug cartel.
   In the past month alone, drug agents have seized 3.7 tons of
cocaine in a single shipment of lumber, taken two tons from a
speedboat making a run into the Keys, and confiscated two tons more
hidden in food shipments.
   That dwarfs the 3.3 tons Lehder was convicted of smuggling into
the country from 1978 to 1980, though he is considered responsible
for much more.

   Big increases in food, energy and clothing
costs sent consumer prices up 0.4 percent in April, an annual rate
of increase of 5.3 percent, as the country got its second monthly
dose of higher inflation, the government reported Friday.
   Inflation, which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six
years, is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight
labor markets, high factory operating rates and a weak dollar,
analysts said.
   The April price increase followed a 0.5 percent May advance,
which had been the sharpest monthly gain since January 1987.
Analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two months is
worrisome because it reflected price increases in a variety of
areas.

<HEAD>Walters Art Gallery Reopens After $6 Million Overhaul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years after the original 1904 Walters Art
Gallery closed for a $6 million overhaul, Baltimore's Renaissance
palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate
Henry Walters envisioned for one of the greatest private art
collections in the world.
   The renovation has created for Walters' precious jewels,
bronzes, paintings and sculpture _ what gallery director Robert P.
Bergman calls a ``seamless museum environment'' that is easy on the
eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history.
   ``In a lot of ways, we think the public is going to see the
collection for the first time,'' Bergman said recently, pointing
proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure
viewers. ``We direct people directly to the object through the
lighting.''
   The massive stone building with a marble-columned court
fashioned after the 17th-century Palazzo Balbi in Genoa, Italy, is
one of six comprehensive museums in the United States. Walters
bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931, along with the
22,000-piece collection.
   The leaking roof, blackened marble, drab painted walls and
poorly lighted rooms Bergman inherited when he left an art history
post at Harvard University and arrived here are gone. In their
place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring
gleaming stone; rich, silk moire; red, blue and gold cotton damask;
polished woods, glass, lucite and plaster. The works themselves
were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden
for centuries.
   The renovated gallery holds some of the 30,000-object collection
spanning 5,000 years of history. A 1974 addition that stayed open
during the renovation holds many of the works, while thousands more
lie in storage.
   Walters, who made his fortune with the Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad, left the collection _ along with a $3 million endowment _
to his native city ``for the benefit of the people.''
   The works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving
14th-century Italian perspective paintings called ``View of an
Ideal City,'' an early life-size Italian crucifix from the school
of Cimabue, the first Raphael Madonna to come to America and one of
only 12 known paintings by Hugo Van Der Goes.
   Now, however, their future is assured by a climate and
light-controlled environment that is so high-tech that special
louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights,
and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent
oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces.
   Bergman jokingly calls the project a ``modest calling.''
   ``We wanted to create the finest facility possible for this
collection of Renaissance, Baroque and 18th-century paintings and
sculpture and decorative arts,'' he said.
   ``To do that was a special project. The building is a work of
art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark
structure,'' said the medievalist who moved from the rarified
atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as
ceaseless champion of his world-class museum.
   Bergman is satisfied with the effort, financed with $1 million
in city funds, $1 million in state funds and another $4 million in
contributions. In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the
money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches
original woods and marble-painted sculpture bases mimic the marble
columns for a consistent look.
   Going room to room, Bergman marvels at the miraculously
preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for Marie
Antoinette; a collection of European porcelains considered second
only to the British royal collection at Windsor Castle; and some of
the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient
Egypt to art nouveau.
   The installation includes a 19th-century alcove modeled on a
French goldsmith's shop for Walters' delicate Faberge enamels, an
iris corsage ornament created by Tiffany and Co. and an ivory
orchid comb by Lalique.
   The gallery went up between 1904 and 1909, and before Walters'
death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge
admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father,
who began the collection, had done.
   More recently, the gallery has been drawing 150,000 to 200,000
visitors a year, including 1,500 museum members who celebrated the
official opening on May 15. The first visitors to the reopened
gallery included former employees as well as local visitors
seasoned by a lifetime of trips.
   One after another, they stopped Bergman to thank him for
restoring the collection to splendor.
   ``Just hearing these people convinces me we did the right
thing,'' he said.

   Tigermania is here.
   The Grammy award-winning Tigres del Norte, the kings of northern
``ranchera'' music, are performing the songs that champion
struggling, working-class people.
   At a recent concert, the outdoor arena in this town in the
northern border state of Nuevo Leon was so tightly packed with fans
that those in the front rows had to brace their arms against the
stage to keep from being smashed into it.
   And fans of all ages struggled through the crowd to hand
requests and flowers to the five-man band which has sold more than
20 million albums to date.
   It's their music, after all _ northern ``ranchera,'' polka-style
ballads backed by an accordion, two guitars, a saxophone and drums.
   And for the past 18 years, Los Tigres del Norte, the Tigers of
the North, have been making it famous in Latin neighborhoods
throughout the United States and Central America.
   The Grammy award for best Mexican-American performance has
opened new doors for Los Tigres, they said. And now they're hoping
to be able to perform with artists from the United States. They won
for their Grammy-winning album, ``Gracias ... America ... Sin
Fronteras,'' or ``Thanks ... America ... Without Borders.''
   Their new album, ``Idols of the People,'' contains two songs
sung in English and Spanish, marking their first attempt to reach
an English-speaking audience.
   ``It's part of the folklore of the north. It's strictly northern
and we don't want it to die,'' said guitar player Raul Hernandez
about ranchera music.
   Los Tigres _ brothers Jorge, Raul and Hernan Hernandez, cousin
Oscar Lara and friend Jose Guadalupe Olivo _ have recorded 18
albums and performed in 12 movies based on their songs in the two
decades since they moved from northwestern coastal Sinaloa state to
California seeking a record contract.
   ``Our music wasn't accepted here in Mexico,'' said Jorge, the
oldest Hernandez brother at 37 and leader of the band. ``Nobody
would put it on the radio.''
   Their lyrics speak of national pride and the realities of their
lives: ``I'm proud to be called Mexican, because there is nothing
else like it,'' one song says.
   They now are residents of San Jose, Calif., and record their
music there.
   Just teen-agers at the time they left Mexico and without a name
for the band, an American immigration agent at the border city of
Calexico, Calif., ``baptized'' the group ``Los Tigres del Norte,''
Jorge Hernandez said.
   From working-class families, only Jorge finished junior high
school and received some formal musical training. They all play
music by ear.
   Tigres producer, Enrique Frinco writes the lyrics and is the
major contributer on the melodies.
   Los Tigres started out singing songs of drug deals gone bad,
such as the 1971 hit ``Contraband and Betrayal'' that launched
their musical career.
   Although the drug theme _ the smuggler always dies _ still is
prevalent in their music, they often sing about the status of
Mexicans living in the United States, such as their hit, ``The
Other Mexico,'' nominated last year for a Grammy.
   ``Don't criticize me because I live on `the other side','' the
lyrics say.
   ``I'm not rootless, I live for necessity.
   ``Already many years since I came as a `wetback,'
   ``my customs haven't changed,
   ``nor my nationality.
   ``I'm like so many other Mexicans, beaten by life, working under
the sun.''
   In ``Gracias ... America ... Sin Fronteras,'' the America of
which they sing is all of North and South America.
   ``America is the whole continent, and he who is born here is
American,'' the song says.
   But the song also says: ``I was born the color of the earth. By
inheritance my language is Spanish. In the north, they call me
Latin. They don't want to call me American.''
   Los Tigres didn't intend to give the impression that America no
longer has borders, or that the group was thanking America for not
having borders.
   ``It's a little confusing,'' acknowledged Raul Hernandez, who
added that fans often request the song ``America Without Borders.''
   ``Our idea was to make it known to the people that buy our
albums that they should feel American,'' said Jorge Hernandez.
   Los Tigres said they were kicked out of restaurants in the
United States because they spoke only Spanish when they first began
touring in the 1970s. They say Mexican-Americans still are made to
feel like second-class citizens in the United States.
   ``Our songs tell Mexicans that they can triumph in other
countries,'' said Jorge Hernandez, ``and not just as laborers, but
looking for the best opportunities the country has to offer.''
   All married and with children, their music in recent years has
included the theme of Mexican-American children and their identity
with Mexico. In ``The Gold Cage,'' the father speaks in Spanish and
the child in English.
   Hernan Hernandez said the best thing about receiving the award
is that it's focused more attention on the group.
   ``To be Mexican and be able to show it to the rest of the world
is the best there is,'' he said.

   Are things really that bad?
   Is the economy ready to swell into inflation and plunge into
recession? Are interest rates about to soar? Are we helpless
against the enemy? Or are there tools for dealing with problems?
   During the past week, a cloud of pessimism descended upon those
who look into the future. It blotted out the sun and obscured
vision, and it induced a lot of people into stating that the dark
ages had returned.
   Good news became bad news. Small, fractional increases in
various economic measurements were projected to the extreme. Tools
to contain inflation, soften recession or keep interest rates in
check suddenly seemed useless.
   Contradictions were presented as wisdom. If interest rates were
to soar, for instance, how could the economy simultaneously turn
into a runaway bull? Wouldn't the sky-high interest rates prevent
that?
   Faith was abandoned. What ever happened, for example, to the
notion that growth needn't be inflationary if based on productivity
gains? Or that the economy could be influenced by the Federal
Reserve, albeit with great limits?
   What became of restraint? Does a small increase in interest
rates mean that huge increases will follow and persist for years?
Or that the economy will pitch forward into the worst recession
ever?
   A lot has to do with the perspective, and that perspective has
been marked for years by wariness, weariness, doubt and probably
mean-spiritedness.
   Economist Paul Craig Roberts says one reason for the gloomy
perspective is that supply-side economics was supposed to fail; the
recovery wasn't supposed to happen and interest rates and inflation
weren't supposed to fall.
   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president of Gruntal & Co., a securities
firm, says that positive events have left so many forecasters with
egg on their faces that it is hard for them to be pleased with the
economic recovery.
   It is similar in the securities markets, as described by John D.
Connolly, senior vice president at Dean Witter. He observes that
``two of the casualties of the stock market crash last October were
analysis and imagination.''
   Rather than assessing the interplay of forces for change and the
inertia of the status quo, he says, a ``great deal of energy has
been expended in trying to force the present into some historical
mold.''
   It won't fit, he says.
   ``Chronicling the surface similarities between now and 1929 was
an amusing exercise, but it has lost its persuasiveness since the
economy has refused to contract.
   ``Therefore, the hunt is on for another analogy, this time
including overheating and inflation. The analysis and imagination
brought to bear involve annualizing the last numbers.'' That is,
extrapolating them to the extreme.
   Nobody knows what the economy holds in store. It might be
recession. It might be high interest rates. It could mean lower
stock prices. And all these possibilities could be faced in the
extreme.
   But if all this happens you may be sure that recovery will
follow. If there is one thing known for certain about all
industrial economies it is that they are cyclical. Ups and downs
precede and follow each other.
   While today's consensus seems to view the world through dark
glasses, you can still find some rose-tinted views, such as this
encouraging observation from Gerald W. Perritt, publisher of the
newsletter Investment Horizons.
   He writes: ``Do not be frightened by bear markets. On the
contrary, since they present a rare opportunity to accumulate the
shares of good companies at bargain prices you should view bear
markets in a favorable light.
   ``Remember, the only time you want stock prices to be at their
peak is the day you plan to sell. In the meantime, you should be
glad that the stock market periodically places its merchandise on
sale.''

   The nation's first law making recycling
mandatory across a state has forced New Jersey residents to become
more intimate with their trash.
   No longer can one toss the chicken bones, the baby food jars and
the bean cans into the garbage bag and forget about them. Recycling
isn't just for Boy Scouts operating Saturday newspaper collections
anymore.
   To 79-year-old Vera Collett, this means converting her kitchen
into a mini recycling center. She has to collect newspapers,
bottles and garbage in separate containers and then remember which
day to carry each bag downstairs for pickup.
   ``Well, for us old folks it's a pest,'' she said, adding, ``I
guess we can struggle through if we have to.''
   Her resigned acceptance is echoed across New Jersey as county
governments tackle the logistical difficulties of recycling and
residents contend with separating coffee grounds from cans and
soaking labels off bottles.
   ``It's not pleasant, and to tell you the truth, it's a pain in
the neck. But it has to be done,'' said Mark Hart of Fair Haven.
   Brian Krulick, an 11-year-old from Manalapan whose chores
include most of his family's recycling, said he hears many similar
complaints from the grown-ups around him.
   ``They think it's a pain in the neck, but it's worth it,'' he
concluded. ``It's a good law because you're throwing away a
resource, but it's a lot better to use it again.''
   New Jersey's law was the most sweeping in the nation when it was
signed by Gov. Thomas Kean in April 1987. It requires every
community to compost leaves and recycle three materials, chosing
from aluminum, glass, tin, plastic and newspapers.
   By the end of 1988, all of New Jersey's 567 communities are
scheduled to be recycling.
   Under a Rhode Island law that took effect last fall, communities
must recycle trash or be charged higher rates at the state
landfill. Most towns are planning to avoid the higher rates by
refusing to pick up residents' garbage that is not recycled. So
far, two of the state's 39 communities have launched pilot programs
and 16 more are scheduled to begin by the end of the year.
   Connecticut enacted a more comprehensive measure in July 1987
requiring nearly a dozen materials to be recycled, but it is not
scheduled to be in full force until 1991.
   In early May, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a mandatory
recycling law that requires all communities to recycle by late
1992. Oregon has a law requiring recycling in larger communities,
and Pennsylvania is considering a similar statute.
   The state recycling laws have been spurred by the need to ease
solid waste burdens on dwindling landfill space.
   ``New Jersey is probably feeling the pinch of the solid waste
crisis harder than other states because of its limited landfill
space,'' said Judy Roumpf, publisher of the Oregon-based trade
magazine ``Resource Recyling.''
   ``Unfortunately, we tend to be crisis-oriented,'' said Jerry
Rhodes, the recycling coordinator in Paramus, which has faced
soaring rates for dumping garbage at landfills as space became more
scarce.
   Paramus' pilot program for 220 homes allows residents to mix
their glass and metal waste, and bundle their newspapers separately.
   ``The easier it is for the people, the more cooperation you're
going to see. By letting them co-mingle the waste, we meet about
half the resistance,'' said Rhodes. ``We're trying a pilot because
we don't want to make an 8,000-home mistake.''
   Implementation has not been without some hitches.
   Officials report problems with curbside scavengers stealing
valuable aluminum, which is commanding up to 50 cents a pound.
   Midnight dumpers have dropped unwanted couches and refrigerators
at community recycling centers.
   Oceanside communities are gearing up for seasonal problems when
vacationers are likely to ignore local recycling pickup schedules.
   Other towns have encountered problems with waste haulers who get
paid by the ton and cart away garbage, even if it is improperly
loaded with newspapers and glass.
   Still others say they have heard of residents bragging that they
circumvent the law simply by sticking to plastic bags that can't be
seen through.
   State Sen. Paul Contillo, who created the law, said he wants to
revise it to eliminate loopholes and make it easier to go into the
recycling business. At the same time, he said, the state must avoid
opening the field to organized crime, which controls some waste
haulers.
   Another obstacle has been generating markets for the recycled
plastics. The state must report back to the legislature by the end
of the year on what steps have been made.
   Many local recycling coordinators say compliance has been good.
   But residents continue to grumble. Some complain the new law
makes them giftwrap their garbage, and others grow angry when their
rubbish is left by the curb because a hauler spotted a wayward
glass jar.
   ``There's always going to be maybe 5 percent of the people who
feel you are asking them to do something they should not have to do
because they're paying their taxes,'' said Ann Moore, the
coordinator in Burlington County.
   Ms. Roumpf said the resistance is no surprise.
   She cited opinion polls showing most people support recycling
``like they support apple pie and motherhood'' _ until they are
asked whether they recycle or if they would want to.

<HEAD>Comic Books Come of Age</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's no bird. He's no plane. And in the first
issue he makes the mistake of trying to rescue Superman.
   He's ``The Tick,'' a clumsy, muscle-bound comic book superhero
in a tick costume who has escaped from a Minnesota insane asylum to
become the protector of Boston.
   ``The Tick'' is also the first publishing venture of New England
Comics, a bookstore chain anchored in Boston that is thriving on a
resurgent national interest in comic books.
   Comic books have come of age along with their readers. Old
favorites are being remodeled, and a new generation of adult comics
takes chances with art, content and subtle humor. Vivid drawings
are richly detailed and often seem charged with an electric current.
   ``It's exploded,'' said George Suarez, a 33-year-old accountant
who co-founded New England Comics five years ago. ``Comics are
being read by more and more of the general population. It used to
be you didn't admit you read comics if you were over 13.''
   Comic books are proliferating in a way not seen since the early
1950s when readership was estimated at 4 million. But it's not all
the same old Superman and Lulu that generated $300 million in
retail sales last year.
   ``Wonder Woman,'' for instance, created in 1941 and published by
DC Comics, recently relocated to intellectual Boston and took as
her mentor an archaeologist at Harvard University.
   Her new artist and writer, George Perez, is 33 and based in New
York. He consulted with former Ms. magazine editor Gloria Steinem
before modernizing Wonder Woman.
   ``I try to hold on to some fans, trying to `adultify' her
without ignoring our younger reader,'' said Perez, who said Wonder
Woman has soared out of a slump to become one of DC's top five
sellers.
   ``Wonder Woman is most definitely a feminist, or a humanist, in
no uncertain terms,'' he said. ``Her prime goal in life is to teach
peaceful coexistence and equality.''
   Other adult comics include Omaha Cat Dancer, which deals with
male-female relationships, and the Punisher, about a Vietnam
veteran whose adventures address such contemporary issues as drugs
and white-collar crime on Wall Street.
   Comic books emerged in 1933 as an evolutionary offshoot of comic
strips, neatly reflecting the churnings of American popular culture.
   In the mid-1950s, comic books were widely read for their
detailed and energetic violence and often moralistic messages
railing against war and racism. But their very popularity
frightened people, and in a McCarthy era backlash, comic books were
accused of causing juvenile delinquency.
   Senate hearings were held. The industry retreated and comic book
publishers instituted self-censorship with the Comics Code
Authority. With comic books tamed, their audience shrank.
   Comic books began to recover, however, in the '60s when products
of the baby boom toddled off to college and found the superheros
waiting for them.
   Like everything else, that revival of mainstream fare also had
its anti-establishment variety in underground ``comix,'' with their
stories about hippies, long-haired motorcyclists and loose sex. Zap
Comics and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers were among the stars
of the underground comix market.
   The future computer scientists, engineers, defense analysts and
psychologists who read those comic books still buy them. But their
tastes have aged.
   ``Today's comics readers expect more, they expect depth of
character,'' said Marc Dolan, who is earning a doctorate at Harvard
University in the history of American civilization and is a student
of comics. ``They want earthy realism, like the way Stephen King
blends werewolves with Burger King.''
   These grown-up comic books can be read on two levels, he said.
``It's sort of like Huck Finn. You can have fun, or you can say
this thing is coming down the river and what does it mean?''
   Comic books have eclipsed stamps, coins and wine as collectible
investments, according to Jerry Weist, a Boston comic book
collector and dealer for 28 years.
   However, while Weist estimated the number of collectors today at
around 250,000 million, he said few will make anywhere near the
$60,000 fetched in the past year by a single mint-condition issue
of the first Marvel Comics.
   ``A lot of it has gotten out of hand,'' he said. ``Collecting is
risky. ... Stamps, coins and wines have been around for three
centuries and they will outlast comic books.'' Weist predicted that
the cheap paper on which comics are printed will not allow them to
last, and in 50 or 75 years those precious early copies of Superman
and the others won't be worth holding on to.
   The Boston area is thick with stores that specialize in the
higher-priced comic books than run from 75 cents to $15 and
supplement newsstand offerings.
   That's the story around the country, said John Davis, a
co-founder of Capital City Distribution in Madison, Wis., the
country's biggest comic book distributor, carrying every one of the
approximately 400 titles available.
   Davis said in a telephone interview that the average comic book
reader is a 20-year-old male, although about 20 percent of comic
book fans are older. He estimates there are just half a million
regular readers of comics, about 5 percent of them female.
   ``These are an example of the growing sophistication of comic
books as an art form in the past five to 10 years,'' Davis said.
``In a way, that may be a result of the fact that the baby boom is
growing older.
   ``Comics today are better than they ever have been. Comics have
grown up.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Play Becomes a Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If it bombed in Pretoria, will it play in
Peoria? Paul Slabolepszy hopes so.
   At one theater in South Africa, the entire audience walked out
on Slabolepszy's new anti-apartheid film, ``Saturday Night at the
Palace.'' Now he's looking for a more sympathetic crowd in the
United States.
   ``People couldn't take it,'' Slabolepszy said of the movie's
South African run. ``It's kind of like showing a movie of someone
dying of lung cancer to an audience who are all heavy smokers. It's
so real and so close.''
   The movie is based on a real event _ a rampage by two white men
at a black-run roadhouse on the outskirts of Johannesburg. It was
made into a play that ran in South Africa and Europe.
   Slabolepszy, 40, who wrote the successful play on which the film
is based, plays Vince, a white racist who winds up at a diner late
one night with his nerd of a roommate, Forsie. The black manager of
the roadhouse, played by Tony Award-winning actor John Kani, is
just closing up for the night.
   Forsie wants only to use the telephone, but Vince demands that
the manager, whose name is September, reopen for business. In a
scene that encompasses the last half of the movie, an increasingly
ugly confrontation pits the characters, in shifting allegiances,
against one another.
   The movie, produced and directed by South African Robert Davies,
is a catharsis of sorts for Slabolepszy, who based Vince's
character _ loud, abusive, violent _ on some of the people with
whom he grew up in a small South African town. The son of Polish
immigrants, he moved to South Africa when he was 3 years old.
   ``I grew up in a kind of white racist area _ the attitudes were
very deep,'' he said in a recent interview. ``And when I went to
college (University of Cape Town) ... I was studying alongside
blacks and meeting them socially, and it was a stunning
transformation. Because all of the prejudices I'd grown up with
suddenly melted away, and I realized I'd been living in the middle
of this kind of lie.
   ``I can't watch the movie,'' he said. ``I just slide down in my
seat and I'm praying for someone to get rid of this guy (Vince).
It's just too much _ it assaults and assaults and assaults. But in
a way it's a story that has to be told.''
   At one point in the film, Vince, the unemployed roustabout,
delivers a monologue that frames the movie's political message.
   Enraged at the stubborn gentility of September, he roars,
``Who's he to be in charge of a roadhouse when I'm out of work?
Everywhere you go, all you see is black faces. Bus drivers, bank
tellers _ bloody three-piece suits, man!''
   Apartheid, says Slabolepszy, ``comes from the soul of that kind
of character. It comes from fear _ it's a fear of being swamped.''
   ``This character, Vince, has, I think, the central line of the
(film) when he says, `My old man said if you let a black man get
the better of you, that's the end, you're finished; there's no
going back.' That's his belief.''
   This is a heady time for Slabolepszy and others in South
Africa's artistic community. A series of hit plays have emerged
from Johannesburg _ ``Master Harold ... and the Boys,''
``Sarafina,'' ``Woza Albert,'' among others. South African music
has become an international rage and there is an emergence of black
South African art and literature.
   ``History is happening,'' said Slabolepszy, who yearns to
someday ``make a picture of hope.'' Perhaps, he muses, there will
be a ``happy accident'' in South Africa. In the meantime, he finds
his drama in turmoil.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Chinese Fleeing to Canada and Investing Heavily</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: dollar figures are U.S. unless specified as Canadian.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Chinese first came to Canada as cooks and
launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago. Today they flying in
from Hong Kong with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and
real estate.
   For the large majority, Canada is a hedge against Hong Kong's
reversion to Chinese Communist sovereignty in 1997.
   While Hong Kong entrepreneurs find easy entry under Canada's
``investor immigrant'' program, hospitals in Toronto and Vancouver
in British Columbia report an increase the number of Hong Kong
women who come to have babies because the infants automatically
become Canadian citizens.
   Other Chinese come as students and professionals.
   But the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome.
   ``They have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars (U.S. $4
million) for a house because in Hong Kong it would be 20 million
($16 million),'' said Premier David Peterson of Ontario.
   One recent buyer was Stanley Ho, whose casino and ferry empire
in Hong Kong and Macao makes him one of Asia's richest men. He paid
5.5 million Canadian dollars ($4.4 million) for a 25-room mansion
on Bridle Path, Toronto's millionaire's row.
   Across the country in Vancouver, Li Ka-shing, whose companies
represent 20 percent of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, won the
bidding in April for the right to develop the choice 210-acre site
of Expo '86.
   Through his 25-year-old son, Victor, a Canadian citizen, Li
plans to spend $1.6 billion to turn the choice downtown strip into
``Pacific Place,'' a high-rise complex that will consist of a
24-hour global financial center, a 400-room hotel, manmade islands
with 10,000 housing units and a 630-berth marina.
   Li and his son also control 52 percent of Husky Oil Ltd.,
Canada's 12th largest oil company, and his Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp. bought the ailing Bank of British Columbia this past
November.
   Officials estimate the current flow of Chinese investment at
$1.6 billion a year, half of it in real estate. Hong Kong Chinese
own one-third of the shopping malls in the Toronto suburb of
Scarborough, one of three metropolitan Chinatowns.
   Edward Hou, a Canadian-Chinese community leader, said his real
estate company deals with 100 Hong Kong investors a month.
   After the first Chinese came for the gold rush and later to work
on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Canada
discouraged further immigration by imposing a tax of $50 a head on
new arrivals. Those who stayed were denied citizenship until 1947.
   Today, 600,000 Canadians are of Chinese descent, including more
than 200,000 in Toronto and 175,000 in Vancouver.
   At any one time, 18,000 Hong Kong students are enrolled at
Canadian universities.
   Hong Kong has become the leading source of immigrants to Canada,
with 22,100 visas issued last year.
   ``I came in 1967,'' said David Lam, a 65-year-old Vancouver real
estate magnate who has donated more than $5 million to British
Columbia universities and the Sun Yat-sen Classical Chinese Garden
in Vancouver, a replica of the ancient gardens of Suzhou.
   Lam pulled off the biggest real estate deal in Vancouver's
history in 1972 and has since built a fortune as a conduit for
other Hong Kong investors.
   ``Now we're seeing more than just flight capital,'' Lam said in
an interview. ``There's a second strata of people, young
professionals who see the writing on the wall for Hong Kong and are
afraid.''
   The Chinese Communists have agreed to allow Hong Kong to
maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after the reversion of
sovereignty, but many Hong Kong Chinese are hedging against that.
   ``Canada is seen as desirable because of its political stability
and large Chinese population.'' said Andrea Eng, a Vancouver
realtor.
   Canada's ``investor immigrant'' program offers a visa in
exchange for investment of 150,000 Canadian dollars ($121,500) to
500,000 dollars ($405,000) in approved businesses.
   Government figures show Hong Kong investment under the program
totaled 776 million Canadian dollars ($628 million) last year and
created 4,500 jobs.
   Premier Peterson of Ontario said he welcomes the well-heeled
arrivals.
   ``Canada has been built by foreign capital _ over 50 percent of
our manufacturing industry is foreign-owned,'' he said.

<HEAD>Short Sellers, `Bear Raiders' New Subject of Post-Crash Concern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the search for stock saboteurs and
bear-market villains hiding in the aftermath of the October crash,
a new group of suspects has emerged _ the short sellers, investors
who bet money that prices will drop.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Stock
Exchange have quietly been probing allegations that improper short
selling may have contributed to the crash, though evidence of
wrongdoing hasn't yet emerged.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the
over-the-counter market, is considering whether to implement
restrictions on short selling.
   In addition, several companies have raised a post-crash clamor
about alleged manipulation of their stock by users of the trading
tactic. The head of one such company, Urgent Care Health Systems
Inc., is co-sponsoring a conference Monday on short selling, titled
``Is Anyone Really Safe?''
   Short selling in itself isn't a crime. In theory, short sellers
sell borrowed stock they believe is overvalued, on the hunch the
price will decline. Potential profits can be immense.
   For example, if a short seller borrows 100 shares at $1 a share
and sells them, he earns $100 and uses the money as collateral for
the borrowed shares. If the stock drops to 50 cents a share, the
short seller buys 100 shares, returns the borrowed stock and
pockets $50.
   Defenders of short selling argue that it injects liquidity into
the market and helps all investors more accurately determine
whether a touted stock is worth buying or not.
   ``Selling short enables market participants to adjust positions
and causes stock to be more responsive,'' said Peter J. DaPuzzo,
head of retail equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
``I think short selling has a lot of positive attributes.''
   Critics say short selling can be disastrous to fledgling
companies trying to raise capital, especially in the post-crash
environment when so many investors already are avoiding the stock
market.
   ``There's nothing illegal about selling short if you think a
company is going to be in decline. What's bad is when people
deliberately circulate adverse information that may be false for
the purpose of causing a stock to go down,'' said A.A. Sommer, a
former SEC commissioner and securities lawyer in the Washington,
D.C., law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.
   Foes of short selling often recall how the strategy was widely
abused after Crash of 1929, when it played a central role in the
``Bear Raids'' in which speculators would relentlessly gang up on a
target company, spreading lies about it to drive down the stock
price.
   Such abuses led the NYSE to implement the short-sale rule, also
known as the uptick rule, which theoretically prevents short
sellers from mercilessly depressing a stock price.
   Under the rule, a short sale may be executed only if the
previous sale moved the stock up at least [ point, or one ``tick.''
But there are strategies for sidestepping this rule, and a debate
has intensified on whether it works.
   Moreover, the stocks most susceptible to short-selling assaults
haven't been protected by the uptick rule, since they are usually
small, over-the-counter issues such as upstart high-technology or
research concerns.
   These stocks soared in value in the 1982-87 bull market and
became visible targets for short sellers.
   In the case of Occupational Urgent Health Care Systems, for
example, founder James Cameron has contended that short sellers
tried to destroy his company by spreading vicious rumors about its
management.
   The stock of Carrington Laboratories, a drug firm working on a
substance that could advance treatment for AIDS, sank after false
rumors surfaced that the company was prohibited from testing in the
United States. Carrington's management claims short sellers spread
the rumors.
   Still, many investment professionals believe the argument
against short selling isn't persuasive and that further regulation
would make U.S. stock markets less attractive.
   ``We're not going to try to defend anybody who lies about a
company to knock its stock down. That's wrong,'' said Michael
Murphy, a short-selling strategist who publishes the Overpriced
Stock Service Newsletter. ``But 98 percent of the effort in the
securities business is aimed at touting stocks. There's far, far
more lying pushing stocks up then pushing them down.''
   The real effect of short sellers, Murphy argues, is to expose
companies that have serious deficiencies.
   ``People say short selling is un-American. But it's the reason
America has the best capital market in the world,'' Murphy said.
``You need to get a lot of opinions into the market.''

   There is something so sad about the rows of
graves freshly cut into the bright green grass.
   Something so wrong about magnolias coming alive in these days of
mourning. Spring is a time of rebirth and renewal.
   A week ago, the children of Radcliff were planning their
summers, playing ball, practicing the trumpet. But these have been
seven days of sorrow. Each day, tears. And one question with no
answer: Why?
   Most of the children, many of them classmates, were buried in
the warming soil this past week, seven days after their church bus
was hit head-on by a pickup truck heading the wrong way on the
interstate highway.
   The pickup driver, who police said was drunk, has been charged
with 27 counts of murder _ one for each of 24 children and three
adults.
   It was one of the nation's worst bus crashes and every parent's
worst nightmare. In this Army town, next to Fort Knox, these have
been seven days in which faith has been tested, dreams destroyed
and pain endured.
   ``The shock really hasn't worn off,'' said the Rev. Dan
Mattingly of the First Assembly of God, which lost 13 members.
``It's going to take a long, long time to heal the hurt.''

   It began as a journey home, the end of a day's outing at Kings
Island amusement park near Cincinnati.
   It ended in the still of the night May 14 on Interstate 71.
   At 10:55 p.m., the bus was near Carrollton, 100 miles from home,
heading south when it was rammed by the pickup, driven by Larry
Mahoney, traveling north on the wrong side of the road. Tests
showed his blood-alcohol level was 2{ times the legal limit.
   The collision ruptured the bus gas tank, turning the front of
the vehicle into a smoky fireball. Screaming, panicked children
piled on top of each other in their struggle to escape.
   With 67 people inside, the front door blocked by flames and just
one working door in back, dozens were trapped. Many were saved.
Joshua Conyers, 14, died a hero _ pushing his critically burned
brother, Aaron, 13, out a window.
   ``He loved his family and his little brother,'' recalled Martha
Tennison, wife of the pastor of the First Assembly of God.
   By the time Trooper Jim Mudd arrived half an hour later,
helicopters had ferried some of the injured to Louisville, about 50
miles away.
   ``There was quietness, somberness,'' he recalled. ``There was
smoke, the heavy stench of death from the remains.
   ``Being a father and a parent,'' he said, ``it hurts so much
more when you see young people, teen-agers, so many of them dead at
one particular scene.''

   For the 27 dead, the trip home finally ended three days later in
a procession of gray hearses from Carrollton, traveling the same
route the bus would have taken. At the accident site, someone has
since placed a cross of pink plastic flowers.
   The grim task of identification took two days. Dental records
were used for most, clothing, shoes and jewelry for others.
   Most bodies were taken to the Radcliff area; others went to
Missouri, Florida, Colorado and Tennessee.
   It took nearly four hours for all the hearses to leave.
Departures were staggered to ease the pain.
   ``The idea of seeing a bunch of hearses in front of the funeral
home ... we thought would be devastating to the community,'' said
Aaron Smith, a Lexington funeral director who helped out.
   ``I cannot identify with those families,'' he said softly. ``I
have not lost a child. It is normal for them to start thinking
about their children burying them in 40 or 50 years. They are
suddenly having to bury their own children. ... How can anybody
deal with it?''

   Talking. Day and night, people have met at churches, schools and
Fort Knox, where a 24-hour crisis phone line was set up.
   Seventeen of those killed had some link to the Army post. A
sergeant lost his entire family: his wife _ a childhood sweetheart
_ and his two daughters.
   ``If you're in the Army, the job is to do a soldier's work,''
said Maj. John Eagles, a spokesman. ``That might include getting
killed. (But) the children have been killed. Everything you've
trained for _ all that is out the window.''
   Every day people ask why _ a question with no answer.
   `They're confused,'' said the Rev. Danny Glover, who counseled
students at one middle school. ``They want to know why God let that
happen.''
   There is anger, too, he said. ``At the same time, that anger is
mixed with a feeling of pity for the driver _ human justice will
never be able to do anything worse than having him (live) with the
memory of what happened.''

   They are now names and faces in the newspapers. A week ago, they
were sons and daughters, husbands and wives, leading quiet lives.
Each has a story.
   Robin Williams, 10, whose sister and mother were also killed,
played her first softball game last week.
   Phillip Lee Morgan, 13, a drummer, was to play in his first
concert Monday.
   Shannon Rae Fair, 14, was baptized on Easter last month.
   And Jennifer Ann Arnett, 13, ``just wanted everybody to be
happy,'' said Mrs. Tennison. ``She didn't want anybody to be hurt.
And she loved to play her trumpet.''
   And then there's John Pearman, the bus driver who died trying to
save his passengers. His 14-year-old daughter was critically
injured.
   Neighbors remember Pearman from the child they held in their
arms to the man who grew to be a soldier in Vietnam, Hardin circuit
court clerk, member of the Radcliff City Council. Last month, he
was ordained as a minister at the First Assembly of God.
   John loved children, attended softball games with his girls and
``wouldn't have left that bus with one person on it,'' said his
uncle, state Sen. Virgil Pearman.
   Ironically, he said, John was always the one who consoled
mourners. ``He always had the right words to say and was always the
person who took over.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Praying. All week, mourners have come to the Assembly of God,
where scores of arrangements of roses, lilies and chrysanthemums
from across the nation are lined up at the altar.
   The church has received nearly 1,000 letters, some from young
children expressing their condolences.
   Folks here hold fast to their religion. ``This is a time you
have to draw on your faith,'' said Betty Durrance, whose
16-year-old son escaped the bus.
   Mrs. Tennison's son also got out safely. ``Someone pushed him
out of the back door,'' she said. ``I'd rather say he's blessed
than lucky. God just blessed us.''
   This week, the funerals will be over. The anguish will remain.
   ``The worst is yet to come,'' said Pearman. ``As families try to
get back to their ordinary lives, there's not going to be those
friends and that support. They will get over it. Time's the only
thing that heals the wounds.''

   Lawmakers are accusing the authors of a White
House report on financial markets of ignoring the exchanges' wildly
swerving behavior and the resulting flight of small investors from
Wall Street.
   But the top-level federal officials who conducted the study
defended their recommendations Thursday and insisted the economic
forces responsible for the market volatility of recent months are
beyond government control.
   The officials recommended instituting a ``circuit breaker'' to
temporarily halt trading on the nation's stock, futures and options
exchanges should the Dow Jones industrial average fall by 250
points in a single day.

   George Bush may be getting valuable
election-year help from Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III,
according to some economists who suggest Baker has been leaning on
U.S. allies to maintain Bush's most valuable campaign asset, the
65-month economic recovery.
   The Treasury Department wouldn't comment Thursday on such
speculation. But the economists point to recent activity in
international markets to bolster their contention.
   The activity includes intervention in currency markets by other
nations' central banks and heavy foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities.

   The Wall Street Journal said Thursday that documents it obtained

   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at $17.45 per

   Among June contracts for refined products traded on the
exchange, wholesale prices for unleaded gasoline rose 0.03 cent to
52.26 cents per gallon, while heating oil rose 0.56 cent to 47.63
cents per gallon.
   June crude prices were down for most of the day, pressured
partly by market awareness of abundant inventories, said Chris
McCormack, an analyst at the Drexel Burham Lambert Inc. securities
firm.
   By the close, however, crude had joined the unleaded gas and
heating oil in moving into the black, mainly because of technical
reasons, he said.

<HEAD>Ministers Set Stage For Year-End Showdown In Farm Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ministers from leading industrialized countries
have set the stage for what some said would be a crucial year-end
showdown over a U.S. call for ending public subsidies to the
world's farmers.
   After two days of talks on trade and other world economic
issues, the ministers agreed Thursday to work for ``tangible
progress'' in liberalizing global trade in agriculture and other
fields.
   Liberalizing the rules of trade generally is considered a
crucial step for ensuring the long-term health of the world
economy. A key aim is to suppress tendencies by some nations,
including the United States, to shield domestic industries from
foreign competition.
   The Paris meeting brought together trade and finance ministers
from the 24 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development.
   The ministers said they would try by December to agree on a
``framework approach'' to the trade negotiations, which were
launched in September 1986 under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The 96-nation GATT, which sets and monitors world trade rules,
has scheduled a December ministerial meeting in Montreal to review
progress in the talks.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said the December
meeting must produce agreement on the long-term goal of the farm
trade talks, as well as a ``road map'' and timetable for reaching
that goal.
   All major industrial countries agree that government subisidies
to farmers have grown too large, but they don't agree on how to
correct the problem.
   Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, told Thursday's
meeting that all industrialized countries are guilty of excessive
aid to farmers.
   ``We are all milking our taxpayers to force-feed our cows,
paying huge subsidies to make two blades of wheat grow where one is
more than enough,'' he said.
   New Zealand's finance minister, Roger Douglas, said government
aid to farming in Britain, France, West Germany and Italy alone was
costing them 3 million jobs _ equivalent to the entire population
of New Zealand.
   A main sticking point in the GATT farm negotiations is European
resistance to a U.S. proposal for phasing out all trade-distorting
farm subsidies by the end of the century.
   Willy De Clercq, the European Economic Community's top trade
official, said the EEC, or Common Market, would never agree to
eliminate such subsidies, although it favors unspecified reductions.
   The EEC believes some government aid is needed to protect
farmers' incomes and to keep enough people living in rural areas.
   Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. special trade representative,
acknowledged differences in the U.S. and European approaches but
said officials from both sides of the Atlantic were ``basically on
the same wavelength.''
   He added that the Montreal meeting would be difficult if De
Clercq did not agree with the U.S. view that the December talks
should produce tangible results on farm policy reform.
   Austrialian Foreign Minister Bill Hayden said the December
meeting would be crucial to the prospects for success in the GATT
trade talks, which are expected to last at least until 1990.
   ``If there are no constructive results (in Montreal) there could
be a great loss of confidence'' among the participating
governments, he said.
   Officials from other countries sought to play down the
differences.
   The Paris meeting ``found some middle ground that all sides can
live with,'' said Michael Wilson, Canada's finance minister.
``We're setting ourselves clear objectives for the next few
months.''

<HEAD>Boston Attorney Seeks Nationwide Coalition Of Computer Users</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Facing an apparent trend toward unified standards
among computer giants, a Boston attorney is seeking to organize a
nationwide coalition representing up to 20,000 corporate computer
users to call attention to their needs.
   Peter Marx, head counsel for a group of customers of Data
General Corp., said he plans a meeting Monday in Boston with
representatives of at least a dozen similar groups connected to
other computer firms, including International Business Machines
Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and NCR Corp.
   The proposed coalition of user groups would establish a stronger
voice and greater clout for users concerning development of new
software systems, said Marx. It also would serve as a liaison
between the computer users and the public and Congress, he said.
   A user group is an umbrella organization composed of companies
using the same type of computer system. The members generally use
the group to share information and express concerns to individual
manufacturers.
   ``You look at the articles written about the computer industry
and there is hardly any mention of users, and users are what it is
all about,'' said Marx, who also serves as counsel for the
Washington, D.C.-based Information Industry Association and
chairman of the New England Computer Law Forum in Boston.
   ``There is no voice now for the users. There are some years of
chaos ahead until this issue of a standard operating system is
settled. It's time the users should be united.''
   On Tuesday, four American and three European computers announced
formation of a joint $90 million project to create a software
package modeled after the Unix operating system by American
Telephone & Telegraph. Unix, which controls the basic operation of
a computer, has been sought by non-AT&T customers because it allows
computers from different manufacturers to use the same programs.
   ``If we're moving in the direction of a standard, then it's
vital we make our presence known,'' said Marx. ``It would be too
costly to have a system we can't live with. Leverage is important.''
   Others agreeing to attend the Monday meeting include
representatives of the user groups for Honeywell Bull Inc., Prime
Computer Inc., Xerox Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. Marx would
not name the other user groups planning to attend the meeting.
   Several computer industry analysts question the feasibility of a
nationwide coalition of user groups.
   ``It would be noble cause, but I'm pretty skeptical it could
succeed because there are too many vested interests among the
users,'' said Robert Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research Inc.
in Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``there is a strong need for the
user to speak in unison rather than be led by vendor interest.
Users have generally been meek and mild and non-confrontational,
and this has actually hurt them right in the pocketbooks.''
   Michael Geran, an analyst at Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. in New York, said the push toward connectivity among different
computer systems could unite users in the future, but the variety
of needs may pull apart the proposed coalition.
   ``What's good for one user is not good for another at this
point,'' said Geran. ``It seems there are just too many
applications and needs to unite the users.''

<TEXT>
   Payless Cashways Inc. says takeover strategist
Asher B. Edelman and his partners _ who control 7.6 percent of the
building materials retailer and may make a takeover offer _ have
``nothing to contribute to this company.''
   Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc. of Kansas City,
Mo., disclosed Thursday they had bought about 2.56 million shares
of Payless, the nation's third-largest building materials retailer.
   With about 33.66 million shares outstanding, Kansas City-based
Payless has a market value of about $728 million based on
Thursday's closing price.
   Payless stock rose $1.37{ a share to close at $21.62{ in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   The Edelman-Sutherland holdings were disclosed in a Securities
and Exchange Commission filing.
   Perry Sutherland, one of the family members who runs
privately-held Sutherland Lumber, said he had no comment on a block
of 519,000 shares of Payless stock that was traded Thursday. If the
block went to the investment group, that would boost its stake to
about 9.2 percent.
   David Stanley, chairman and chief executive of Payless, said in
a statement that ``in our view, Mr. Edelman and his group have
nothing to contribute to this company or its shareholders, nor do
we believe the reported plan to dismantle the company serves any
constructive purpose.''
   The Edelman group said in its SEC filing that it would consider
selling Payless operations as ``going concerns'' in many regions of
the country.
   Sutherland called it a ``possibility'' that his company would
acquire at least some of the Payless operations that would be sold.
``Our expertise in management is part of the partnership'' with
Edelman, he said.
   Payless has 194 retail facilities in 23 states and reported 1987
revenue of $1.7 billion.
   Spokeswoman Brenda Nolte confirmed that the Payless board of
directors approved a complex shareholder rights plan last week to
``protect shareholders from attempts to acquire control of Payless
at an inadequate price.''
   Nolte noted the board said the plan was intended to
``encourage'' buyers to negotiate with the board before attempting
a takeover.
   Perry Sutherland said his father has had a business relationship
with Edelman for several years. He said Dwight Sutherland, the
company's chief executive officer, serves on the boards of
directors of United Stockyards Corp., Datapoint Corp. and Intelogic
Trace Inc. along with Edelman, who has large investments in these
companies.
   Edelman has launched unsuccessful takeover bids for a gamut of
companies, including Lucky Stores Inc., Fruehauf Corp. and
Burlington Industries Inc., earning millions in the process.
   He acquired the restaurant chain Ponderosa Inc. but is believed
to have made no profit when he sold it.
   National Home Center News, an industry trade publication,
recently ranked Payless the third-largest building materials and
do-it-yourself retailer in the nation.
   The magazine ranked Sutherland Lumber ninth, with estimated
annual revenue of about $650 million. Sutherland Lumber's 86 stores
are concentrated in the Midwest and South.
   In an investment report last month, Sutro & Co. noted Payless
had been considered a potential takeover target for three years.
Sutro contended an acquirer could boost its earnings instantly by
closing down a score of Payless stores in the depressed oil patch
region, where sales were off 45 percent last year.
   Sutro also said pieces of Payless, such as its New England
operation, could be sold at ``substantial premiums ... After some
paring, an acquiror could still retain a major national presence in
the industry through 125-150 profitable, well-located stores.''

<HEAD>Bear Stearns Re-Evaluating Index Arbitrage Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
remarks strongly supporting program trading have prompted Bear
Stearns & Co. to reconsider its recent move to halt its use of the
controversial strategy, the firm says.
   Bear Stearns, one of several major Wall Street firms to reduce
their program trading activity, will ``re-examine its position'' in
light of Greenspan's remarks and other factors, Alan Greenberg,
Bear Stearns' chairman and chief executive officer, said Thursday.
   Bear Stearns went further than four other investment firms when
it announced last week it would stop index arbitrage _ a major form
of program trading _ not only for its own accounts but also for its
customers.
   Salomon Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Group
Inc. and Kidder Peabody & Co. halted index arbitrage for their own
accounts amid concern that the popular form of program trading was
at least partly responsible for the stock market's volatility.
   Greenspan, testifying before the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee, said Thursday that excessive restriction of
index arbitrage would limit market liquidity and tend to
destabilize the market.
   He said ``insufficient arbitrage between cash and futures can be
a destabilizing force in a declining market.''
   In index arbitrage, traders use computers to buy or sell baskets
of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to help
them profit from brief price discrepancies.
   Greenspan said that ``reduced arbitrage implies less connection
between cash and futures markets and more price disparities across
these markets.''
   He also said, ``it is a mistake to single out one segment of the
broad marketplace as the culprit for large and rapid price
movements.''
   Bear Stearns' Greenberg said his firm had been ``monitoring
closely the action and the liquidity problems of the stock market
for the past week.''
   He also pointed to other firms' ``suspension of index arbitrage
activity for themselves but (continuation of) those activities for
customers'' as further reason for the firm to re-evaluate its
position.
   ``If we do decide to re-enter index arbitrage, we will consider
limiting our activities to buying on a downtick and attempting to
sell on an uptick in the stocks involved,'' Greenberg said in a
statement.

<HEAD>Pressure Off Steel Wages, But Not Work Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new buoyancy in the long-floundering steel
industry has eased downward pressure on blue-collar wages, but
companies will continue demanding cost-saving changes in work
rules, companies and analysts say.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chairman Walter Williams says a United
Steelworkers union representative told him recently that 1989
``will not be a concession year.''
   ``I guess with the industry looking better they have a right to
say that,'' Williams told reporters during the American Iron and
Steel Institute annual meeting in Washington.
   Even at LTV Steel Co., which is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws, ``there's not been tremendous pressure
from creditors to cut labor costs,'' President David Hoag said
Thursday.
   Those remarks and others could hearten USW members who retreated
on wages, benefits and featherbedding work rules in two rounds of
bargaining since 1982.
   Contracts at the major producers are due for renegotiation
beginning next year.
   ``If we have a somewhat inflationary labor increase in the U.S.
I think the stock market would overlook it,'' said securities
analyst Peter Marcus of PaineWebber Inc.
   Plant closings and automation have combined with contract
givebacks to help cut labor costs for a ton of shipped steel from
$262 in 1982 to $160 last year. That shift lessened the impact of
wages on production costs.
   ``Also we have had fairly fearsome increases in wages abroad,''
Marcus said Thursday during a panel discussion. ``In Korea last
year they had a 23 percent wage increase, and the Korean won
increased on the order of 10 percent.''
   Analyst James Rudolph of Buckingham Research Group said that
with no signs of rampant inflation, wage increases would not
necessarily hurt steel companies, which are enjoying a recovery of
uncertain duration after five years of devastating losses.
   Peter Anker of First Boston Corp. was more concerned about wage
hikes and encouraged managers to offer stock or a share of profits
to workers instead of ``just another escalation of wage costs.''
   Willaims said he hopes USW negotiators realize ``we're not out
of the woods yet.''
   He stressed the need for further work rule changes that would
``foster more efficient job combinations, reduce idle time and
allow greater flexibiliy in job assignments.''
   Williams said each job eliminated through work rule changes
saves as much as a 10 percent cut in labor costs for 15 workers.
   Labor costs _ including wages, benefits, unemployment insurance,
pension payments and other costs _ peaked for blue-collar steel
workers in 1982 at $26.29 per hour and declined to an average of
$23.70 last year, according to the AISI.
   Blue-collar employment fell from about 190,000 in 1982 to
121,000 in 1987.

<HEAD>Beazer Group Says 75 Percent Of Koppers Stock Owned Or Tendered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investor group waging a $1.7 billion
hostile takeover offer for Koppers Co. says it controls or has been
tendered more than three-quarters of the company's outstanding
common shares.
   The group led by the British construction company Beazer PLC and
the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. stated Thursday
that about 73.2 percent of outstanding common shares and about 68.7
percent of outstanding preferred shares had been tendered as of
Wednesday under its $60 a share tender offer.
   The group also extended its tender offer through midnight EDT
Wednesday.
   The common shares tendered, together with 2.1 million common
shares already owned by related entities, represent about 75.2
percent of the outstanding common shares, the Beazer group
indicated.
   The group must acquire 85 percent of Koppers' shares in order to
complete the deal under the anti-takeover law in Delaware, where
Koppers is incorporated.
   Right now, the group may not purchase Koppers' shares under
terms of federal court injunctions in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.
   It appealed the Los Angeles ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in San Francisco, but a decision has not been announced.
   Also Thursday, U.S. District Judge Maurice Cohill said he would
hold a hearing May 31 on the question of whether the hostile bid
violates federal securities rules.
   The hearing specifically will address whether the $540 million
of preferred securities that the group plans to issue to Shearson
in return for $540 million of its financing should be considered
stock or debt.
   Cohill said the tender offer as currently structured must be
permanently enjoined if the stock in question is found to be a debt
security. If that is the case, the Beazer group could restructure
the financing to comply with regulations.

<HEAD>Castle & Cooke Raises Stake In Amfac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amfac Inc.'s proposed $807.7 million
leveraged buyout apparently was a move to stave off a takeover
threat by Castle & Cooke Inc., which is seeking to sharply raise
its stake in the company, analysts say.
   Los Angeles-based Castle & Cooke on Thursday raised its holdings
in Amfac to 7.3 percent from 4.9 percent, and said it had received
federal clearance to buy up to 15 percent of Amfac's roughly 17.2
million outstanding common shares.
   Castle & Cooke chairman David H. Murdock owns another 2.6
percent share of Amfac, according to documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Amfac management proposed its $41 a share buyout offer on
Wednesday to the company's board of directors.
   The company's stock soared $6.75 to $45.12{ a share Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange, indicating speculation a higher offer
would emerge. Castle & Cooke stock closed at $24.75, up 50 cents a
share.
   The buyout would be led by Amfac President and Chief Executive
Officer Richard L. Griffith, who has said it would strengthen the
company's ability to develop Amfac's Hawaii asset base ``in a paced
and profitable manner.''
   Amfac is a diversified services company with main lines of
business in food processing, hotels and resorts, retail,
agriculture and property. It had revenue of $2.2 billion last year.
   Castle & Cooke has operations in food production, through its
Dole Food company, the world's biggest pineapple producer;
transportation equipment leasing; and real estate development.
   San Francisco-based Amfac is Hawaii's largest landowner, while
Castle & Cooke is No. 2.
   Murdock, who has made his reputation by buying and turning
around failing companies, met with Amfac officials in January to
talk over a real estate venture Amfac did not pursue, the
Securities and Exchange filing said.
   Amfac said Murdock proposed merging some of his property into
Amfac in exchange for Amfac stock.
   Securities analyst Kevin Skislock, of Rotan Mosle Inc. in
Houston, said Murdock's aim is to control Amfac's 56,400 acres of
Hawaiian real estate and Amfac's buyout offer is an attempt to
prevent such a move.
   Analyst Randy Havre of J.B. Havre Securities Inc. in Honolulu
said Amfac's valuable Hawaiian land made the $41-a-share buyout
offer ``too cheap.''
   ``My feeling is that shareholders should not tender for less
than $50,'' Havre said. ``Hawaiian real estate is a hot commodity.''
   Analyst Charles Bureker, of Sutro & Co. Inc. in San Francisco,
said there has been speculation that Murdock might be working with
Japanese investors to gain control of Amfac's real estate.

   Stock market crashes similar to last October's
could happen again even if market procedures are changed, say the
top-level federal officials who produced a White House study of the
nation's financial markets.
   The officials told the House telecommunications and finance
subcommittee Thursday that their proposals for changing some market
procedures could do little about external factors that influence
investors.
   Their report is being criticized by lawmakers for its lack of
significant recommendations.
   ``We cannot provide an ironclad guarantee that there will not be
another Oct. 19 in our future,'' said Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan, one of the report's authors. ``Unforeseen
economic forces could, on their own, conceivably trigger such an
event.''
   The White House report, released Monday, focused on the record
508-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of last Oct. 19,
and the unusually large price swings that have occurred repeatedly
ever since. The report was written by Greenspan, Treasury
Undersecretary George D. Gould, Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman David S. Ruder and Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Chairwoman Wendy Gramm.
   The officials recommended instituting a ``circuit breaker'' that
would temporarily halt trading on the nation's stock, futures and
options exchanges in case the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped
by 250 points in a single day. That has happened only once, last
Oct. 19.
   The report also urged that improvements be made in the credit,
clearing and settlement procedures the markets use to complete
transactions.
   But the working group suggested no limitations on computerized
program trading, some forms of which have been blamed for adding to
market volatility. It also failed to agree on whether to change the
margins, or up-front payments, required for futures transactions.
Margin requirements are lower on futures exchanges than for stock
markets, which critics say causes speculation.
   The group ignored as well a recommendation made by an earlier
White House panel headed by Nicholas F. Brady, an investment
banker, that the Fed or some other agency oversee issues that
affect all markets.
   The working group's members have cautioned that it would be
unrealistic to take steps such as curbing program trading.
   ``We cannot go back to the days of the abacus or mechanical
adding machines,'' Gould said.
   Lawmakers, however, accused the report of not going far enough
to ease volatility and soothe worried investors.
   ``It is you and your panel who continue to embrace anachronistic
regulatory reforms that have been outstripped by new
technologies,'' said the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass.
   Further criticism came from Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which the finance
subcommittee is a part. He accused the working group of having
``given birth to a mouse'' and of failing to take steps to restore
investors' confidence.
   ``You should not come by my office when people start buying rope
and heating pots of tar and collecting feathers to apply to persons
... who have sat idly by ... while the financial situation of this
nation erodes,'' Dingell said.
   The subcommittee has been holding hearings on the market's
problems for months, but so far has written no legislation. Asked
outside the hearing room when a bill would emerge, Dingell said,
``As soon as circumstances permit.''

<DATELINE>KELLOGG, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Picketing has ended at the nation's
largest silver mine after a 4{-hour negotiating session produced
tentative agreement on a three-year contract.
   Negotiators for 260 striking miners and Sunshine Mining Co.
announced the agreement late Thursday, the ninth day of the walkout.
   The union's negotiating committee will recommend ratification
when members of United Steelworkers of America Local 5089 vote on
the offer a week from Saturday, said Steve Brown, union
international staff representative.
   ``It took a lot of work and two years,'' Brown said.
   Workers will return starting with the graveyard shift Sunday,
Brown said.
   Production work will resume Monday, said Harry Cougher, vice
president of Sunshine's local operations.
   Both sides refused to release details on the settlement until
union members could review it.
   Workers at the Sunshine Mine downed tools and walked out at
midnight May 10 after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract offer.
Medical coverage, pay, job classifications and production
incentives were among the unresolved issues.
   The mine reopened last November after an 18-month shutdown due
to depressed silver prices. Union members agreed to return under
company-imposed terms while negotiations continued, then struck
when the talks broke down.
   Negotiations resumed Tuesday, ran well into the night Wednesday
and returned Thursday afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Britain's annual inflation rate rose to a
faster-than-expected 3.9 percent in April from 3.5 percent in the
previous month, the government said Friday.
   Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in April from March, the
Department of Employment said. The index rose 0.4 percent in March
from the previous month.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 105.8
in April, 104.1 in March, and 101.8 in April 1987.
   Annual increases in local property taxes and rents and water
charges accounted for nearly half of the monthly rise in the index,
the department said. The department added that most of higher
duties on alcohol, tobacco and gas outlined in the budget for the
current fiscal year, which began in April, were reflected in prices
for that month.
   Market forecasts had called for April's index to post an
increase of between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent from March, and an
increase of 3.5 percent to 3.8 percent from April 1987.

<HEAD>U.S. Urged to Prosecute Oil Company For 1984 Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Labor Department has asked the Justice
Department to consider criminal prosecution of Unocal Corp. and its
executives for a 1984 refinery explosion in south suburban Lemont
that killed 17 people.
   The Labor Department made its request Thursday, following a
finding by an administrative judge that Unocal, then called Union
Oil Co., violated federal health and safety regulations overseen by
the Ocupational Safety and Health Administration.
   Unocal is appealing OSHA citations and the administrative
finding to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   While it does, the company faces the prospect that it and
individual employees could be found in criminal violation of
federal safety regulations.
   OSHA has the right to seek criminal prosecution for such
violations, but rarely has done so during the Reagan
administration, according to the National Safe Workplace Institute.
   OSHA found that Unocal violations included inadequate
inspections for cracks in a pressure tank that exploded, as well as
poor training for its fire brigade.
   In addition to the 17 killed, the July 23, 1984 explosion
injured 21 others.
   After reviewing government and company claims, OSHA
administrative Judge R.M. Child concluded that the company ``failed
to adequately inspect for the presence of cracks in pressure
vessels, which exposed employees to increased likelihood of fire or
explosion.''
   Child also found that the company failed to use inspection
techniques to determine the presence or absence of cracks and that
``this was a willful failure.''
   He said the company ``willfully failed to provide
fire-protective clothing to persons required to handle fires'' and
``willfully failed to provide adequate firefighting and education
to its shift fire brigade.''
   Child rejected one alleged violation and reduced the original
fine levied against Unocal to $22,000 from $31,000.
   Officials of Los Angeles-based Unocal declined to comment
pending a review of the OSHA action.

<HEAD>Minute Maid Launches All-Natural Juice In New England</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new all-natural orange juice has been introduced
in New England to challenge Tropicana Products Inc.'s domination of
the estimated $1.6 billion ready-to-serve orange juice industry.
   The Minute Maid Premium Choice, which contains no additives,
marks Houston-based Coca-Cola Food's entry into the
not-from-concentrate orange juice market, which surpassed frozen
juice in sales in 1986.
   Vice President of Marketing George G. Woody III would not
comment on when the product may be sold in other sections of the
country. It will be available in about 1,200 New England stores.
   Woody said growth in the orange juice market contributed to the
decision to challenge Tropicana, which has a virtual lock on
all-natural orange juice sales.
   ``We consider ourselves the leaders in total orange juice sales
and this is one segment of the market where we looked to expand,''
said Woody on Thursday.
   Woody said New England was chosen for the introduction due to
strong all-natural juice sales, which represent less than 20
percent of the total ready-to-serve orange juice sales.
   Since 1979, orange juice sales in the United States have
increased by 23 percent, with most growth in the chilled,
ready-to-serve market, Coca-Cola Foods reported.
   Per capita consumption of juice in 1987 was 6.1 gallons, down
from a peak of 7.8 gallons in 1983, according to Cleveland-based
Beverage Industry magazine.
   Chilled, ready-to-serve orange juice accounted for 57 percent of
total orange juice sales of about $2.8 billion last year.
   Coca-Cola Foods, a division of The Coca-Cola Co. in Atlanta,
reported sales of approximately $1.2 billion last year. The
division also produces Hi-C fruit juices and Bacardi cocktail
mixers.
   Tropicana, a subsidiary of Beatrice Cos. Inc., is ranked second
by most industry publications, but the Florida-based company does
not release sales figures.
   Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. of Plymouth, the third-ranked juice
company, reported sales of about $735 million last year.

   Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April, only marginally
better than March's 0.5 percent gain, the government reported today.
   More than one-fourth of the April rise came from a steep 2.0
percent jump in clothing costs, tying March for the greatest
one-month gain since price records were first kept in 1947.
   Grocery prices climbed at their fastest pace in 20 months, while
energy prices were up sharply as well _ reflecting the steepest
rise in gasoline prices since August.
   The April gain meant that for the first four months of 1988
retail prices were up at an annual rate of 4.5 percent.
   While this was little changed from the 4.4 percent for all of
1987, economists were concerned because much of the inflationary
pressure has shown up in the last two months. Analysts noted that
the March rise had been the most severe since January 1987.
   On Thursday, investors set aside worries about inflation long
enough to help the stock and bond markets break their recent slides.
   A number of senators, meanwhile, have reaffirmed the
government's pledge to stand behind deposits in the nation's
savings and loan institutions after a congressional agency reported
the doubling of the deficit in the federal S&L insurance fund.
   ``There is absolutely no doubt the U.S. Congress stands behind
our deposit insurance program,'' Banking Committee Chairman William
Proxmire, D-Wis., said at a hearing Thursday by his panel.
   On Wall Street, stock prices staged a partial recovery Thursday
that traders attributed to ``bargain shopping'' and lessening of
recent tension over inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell a total of
56.54 points Tuesday and Wednesday, rose 7.63 to 1,958.72. Broader
market gauges were mixed.
   Bond prices advanced after falling in the first three sessions
this week. The price of the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose
nearly $2.50 for every $1,000 in face value as its yield slipped to
9.27 percent from 9.29 percent late Wednesday.
   In the report on thrifts, Frederick D. Wolf, director of the
accounting and financial management division of the General
Accounting Office, said the liabilities of the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp. exceeded its assets by $13.7 billion at the
end of 1987, up from $6.3 billion a year earlier.
   He also said the money available to the insurance fund _ $28
billion over the next 10 years _ ``probably will not be adequate''
to restore the industry's health by closing or merging 505
institutions listed as insolvent.
   Wolf estimated it would cost $30 billion to $35 billion to clean
up the S&L mess, which is centered primarily in Southwestern states
hard hit by depressed real estate and oil markets. That estimate
does not include an additional 435 ``barely solvent'' institutions,
he said.
   In other economic developments Thursday:
   _The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in
early May while a narrower measure fell, the Federal Reserve Board
reported.
   _The nation's 24 largest investor-owned utilities charged their
commercial and industrial electric users an average 6.28 cents per
kilowatt-hour over the 12 months ended April 30, down from 6.29
cents a year earlier, a study by the consulting firm National
Utility Service Inc. said.
   _Assets of the nation's 425 money market mutual funds rose $3.70
billion to $274.12 billion in the latest week, more than offsetting
a $3.35 billion drop the previous week, the Investment Company
Institute said.

   International Business Machines Corp.,
confirming an important legal victory, said Friday that that the
European Community Commission has dropped an antitrust inquiry
against the computer maker.
   The European Community Commission inspected IBM's computer
leasing operations in the Netherlands last year in response to
complaints by three Dutch leasing companies that IBM engaged in
predatory pricing.
   IBM said the last complaint has been withdrawn and the
commission has decided to close its books.
   ``We are pleased that the commission has confirmed our view that
the allegations of illegal behavior were unfounded,'' the company
said in a statement.
   The probe in the Netherlands was the first notable antitrust
challenge the company had faced in Europe since the settlement in
1984 of an 8-year-old antitrust case. In that case, IBM agreed to
give rivals the technical information necessary to make computers
and related products compatible with its System 370 mainframe
computers.

   The stock market advanced in moderate trading
early today, extending Thursday's rebound, as Wall Street drew some
reassurance from the latest news on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 5.80 points
at 1,964.52 at 10 a.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 2-to-1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 639 issues advancing, 278 declining and
452 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled 20.6 million shares
in the first half-hour of trading.
   The government reported today that consumer prices rose 0.4
percent in April, a level that had been widely anticipated by
economists and traders.
   The retail inflation report ``really was right on the money,''
said Jack Baker, the head of block trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. ``Everyone felt much better ... People seem to be more
willing to bid for stocks today.''
   The stock and bond markets have been haunted this week by fears
that inflation could be rekindled, and the anxiety pushed the Dow
average down a total of 56.54 points on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   If the April rise in consumer prices had been more than the
expected 0.4 percent, many analysts said, stocks and bonds would
likely have taken another sharp hit today.
   Despite today's reprieve, though, analysts said concern about
inflationary pressures continues to hang over the market.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed issues was up 0.40 at
143.41. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose
0.38 to 292.17.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 7.63 to close at
1,958.72 after dropping 25 points in early trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 843 down, 640 up and
496 unchanged. NYSE volume totaled 165.16 million shares, down from
209.42 million shares in the previous session.

<HEAD>Officials Say American Nearing 757 Purchase</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Wednesday is correct in 2nd graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is closing in on a
deal to buy as many as 100 Boeing 757 jets for as much as $4.2
billion to replace aging 727s, company officials say.
   Robert Crandall, chairman and president of American and its
parent company AMR Corp., told shareholders Wednesday at the
company's annual meeting that the airline plans to use the jets to
expand its fleet and phase out 34 727-100s and 125 727-200s.
   Crandall added that American would be following the lead of
other carriers by reducing or canceling the most expensive parts of
its frequent-flyer program. He was not specific about changes, but
said that in general more miles would be required to gain bonuses.
   Al Becker of American in Dallas told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer he did not have a specific figure but that a
100-plane order for delivery in the 1990s was in the ballpark.
   In Seattle, David Himenez of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said
only, ``we're in conversation with them.''
   A final decision on a new $700 million terminal American began
developing last year at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
won't be made before late 1989, Crandall told shareholders.
   The 757 is larger than the three-engine 727 but uses two engines
that are quieter and more fuel-efficient.
   The most recent order for 757s was last month, when
International Leisure Group of Great Britain ordered 22 planes,
boosting total orders to 279. It was second in size of 757 orders
only to the 66 planes sold to Delta Airlines in 1980.

<HEAD>Report Says Cablevision Industries Close to Buying Part of Wometco
Cable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cablevision Industries Inc., a cable television
operator, is close to acquiring some of the assets of Wometco Cable
Co. from the Robert M. Bass Group Inc. for stock valued at about
$750 million, a published report said today.
   The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed industry executives for
its report.
   Calls were placed to Cablevision, which is based in Liberty,
N.Y., and to Wometco, which is based in Miami, but spokesmen were
said to be unavailable.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Bass Group, based in Fort
Worth, Texas, said the company has a policy of not commenting on
its activities.
   The newspaper said the Bass Group quietly put part of the assets
of Wometco up for sale last month.
   Wometco has about 440,000 subscribers and operates cable systems
mostly in the Southeast.
   The story said Cablevision will acquire systems serving about
300,000 subscribers for stock and will assume certain Wometco debt.
The Bass Group will retain about 140,000 subscribers from Wometco
systems and also has an interest in a cable system acquired earlier
this year in Atlanta, the story said.
   Cablevision Industries is a privately-held concern controlled by
its founder Alan Gerry and is currently the 21st largest cable
company with about 600,000 subscribers, the story said.
   The Bass Group purchased Wometco in a 50-50 venture with Taft
Broadcasting Co. in 1986 for about $620 million, and later acquired
Taft's interest, the report said.

   Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April as
clothing costs gained for the second straight month and grocery
prices climbed at their fastest pace in 20 months, the government
said today.
   Energy prices were up sharply as well, reflecting the steepest
rise in gasoline prices since August.
   The overall gain, only marginally better than March's 0.5
percent gain, meant that for the first four months of 1988 retail
prices were up at an annual rate of 4.5 percent.
   While this was little changed from the 4.4 percent for all of
1987, economists were concerned because much of the inflationary
pressure has shown up in the last two months.
   Analysts noted that the March rise had been the most severe
since January 1987. Last month's 0.4 percent overall gain was
equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 5.3 percent.
   ``The general message in this report is that prices have been
rising in the past two months at a faster pace and they will
continue to do so,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with
Merrill Lynch. ``The fears that people have had about higher
inflation are justified.''
   Steinberg said that the underlying inflation rate is now
somewhere around 5 percent, about 1 percentage point higher than it
has been for the last year.
   The stock market, which had fallen sharply on Tuesday and
Wednesday because of worries about inflation and interest rates,
took today's report in stride, with the Dow Jones industrial
average edging up slightly in early trading.
   Analysts said the overall gain did not prompt a new sell-off
because the report was in line with expectations. But they
cautioned that financial markets remain edgy about the building
inflationary pressures.
   More than one-fourth of the April gain in consumer prices came
from a steep 2.0 percent jump in clothing costs, tying March for
the greatest one-month gain since price records were first kept in
1947.
   As was the case with March, analysts said the more expensive
clothing was chiefly the result of higher priced women's clothing
lines.
   Grocery store prices rose 0.8 percent in April, the biggest
advance since August 1986. Leading the way were sharply higher
prices for beef (up 2.3 percent), fish (up 2.9 percent), and fruits
and vegetables (up 1.4 percent).
   Gasoline prices climbed 1.1 percent last month after a 0.4
percent March rise. Last month's jump was the steepest since a 3.3
percent rise in August. After that, gasoline prices had fallen for
six straight months.
   The gasoline price increases over the last two months largely
reflected concern that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would agree with non-member nations to limit production.
   But those talks ended in failure and world oil prices have since
fallen substantially, leading analysts to believe that retail
prices will soon turn downward.
   The department gave these other specifics on April retail price
activity:
   _The record gain in clothing costs reflected an average 3.5
percent gain in the prices of women's apparel, a 2.7 percent rise
in the prices for children's goods and a 2.1 percent jump in men's
clothing costs.
   _New car prices were unchanged while automobile financing costs
fell by 1.1 percent.
   _Public transportation expenses, reflecting a jump in airline
fares, rose 0.8 percent.
   _Home heating oil prices rose 0.9 percent, while natural gas and
electricity costs rose 0.4 percent.
   The April increase left the overall index at 117.1, meaning that
a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84
base period would have cost $117.10 last month. Unlike the other
figures in the report, the overall index is not adjusted for
seasonal fluctuations.
   Fears of inflation have stirred up financial markets in recent
days and economists.
   Stocks barely broke a two-day losing streak Thursday after
worries about inflation and rising interest rates pushed the Dow
Jones industrial average down sharply Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Investors have viewed with some alarm a string of seemingly good
economic reports in recent weeks. Unemployment in April fell to a
14-year-low of 5.4 percent while the factory operating rate climbed
to an eight-year-high of 82.7 percent.
   While evidence of better-than-expected economic activity, the
reports also
   raised fears in financial markets that the economy is growing
too strongly and soon tight labor markets and high factory
operating rates will translate into higher wages and rising prices.
   The Reagan administration maintained that the concerns about
inflation have been overblown. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III told reporters Thursday that the administration saw no reason
to change its forecast that consumer prices would rise by 4.3
percent this year. In 1987, consumer prices climbed 4.4 percent.
   Private economists are in general agreement with the
administration's forecast, contending that the inflation worries
exhibited by the market would subside once the impact of a spike in
oil prices abates.
   ``The markets discovered inflation and now they are overdoing
it,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting
project at Georgia State University. ``Inflation is going to rise,
but I don't see it going above 5 percent even next year.''
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
was not looking for inflation to get above 4.5 percent this year
because of the actions already taken by the Federal Reserve.
   Twice in the past two months, the Fed has tightened up on credit
conditions and pushed interest rates higher in an effort to dampen
economic demand.
   ``The Fed has tightened and it will tighten more and that will
keep inflation in check,'' Evans predicted.

   Coleco Industries Inc., which is
battling to avoid bankruptcy, has lost its license to market the
popular Trivial Pursuit board game.
   The West Hartford toymaker also faces the possibility of losing
its valuable license to market Cabbage Patch Kids products and
dolls, according to officials.
   Coleco will lose the right to market Trivial Pursuit after Dec.
31. Horn Abbott Ltd. of Toronto, the company with the rights to the
game, said Thursday that Tonka Corp. of Minneapolis will
manufacture and market the game beginning in January 1989.
   ``It was a business decision on our part,'' said James G. Ware,
Horn Abbott president.
   Sean McGowan, a vice president with Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. in
New York, said the license for Cabbage Patch Kids, which accounted
for 25.1 percent of Coleco's sales in 1987, may be affected by the
company's financial troubles.
   ``There is no question it is in jeopardy,'' McGowan said.
``There is no question Xavier Roberts does not want to do business
with a company that is in bankruptcy.''
   Roberts is the creator of Cabbage Patch Kids.
   Coleco reported Wednesday that it lost $47.4 million in the
first quarter. The company has a negative net worth of $130.7
million. The company has cut its blue-collar work force in half and
trimmed its corporate staff by more than 30 percnti bid to remain
in business.

   Stock prices eased this morning morning in quiet
trading after a partial rebound from the previous session over
mildly eased concerns about inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 5.47
points to 1,953.25 as of 11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street. Broader market
indices also were slightly lower.
   Gaining issues narrowly led declines on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 658 up, 502 down and 510 unchanged. Volume on the
Big Board totaled 39.68 million shares in the first 90 minutes.
   The government reported today that consumer prices rose 0.4
percent in April. Although that level was widely anticipated by
economists and traders, it substantiated some anxiety about
inflation that has been haunting the market.
   As with other recent sessions, NYSE volume was partly inflated
by trading strategies aimed at capturing dividends of selected
stocks. The Big Board's most active issue was a dividend trade,
Ohio Edison at 17|, down \. More than 4 million shares were traded.
   Among other active NYSE issues, Texaco fell ~ to 48{. There were
reports that the company was contemplating a restructuring plan
that would reduce the 14.8 percent stake of its largest
shareholder, takeover strategist Carl Icahn.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed issues fell .10 to
142.91. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell
0.23 to 291.56.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 7.63 to close at
1,958.72.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 843 down, 640 up and
496 unchanged. NYSE volume totaled 165.16 million shares, down from
209.42 million shares in the previous session.

<HEAD>Goodyear Workers Begin Voting; Firestone Walkout Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative contract settlement between the
United Rubber Workers and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. has been
approved by four of the five union locals that have voted on the
pact, a union spokesman said today.
   Voting by the remaining six locals continues through Monday. The
union represents 15,000 workers at 11 Goodyear plants nationwide.
   Meanwhile, a walkout by 4,700 Firestone Inc. union workers in
six states continues for a sixth day with no contract talks planned.
   URW workers in Union City, Tenn.; Marysville, Ohio; and Topeka,
Kan., voted in favor of the proposed Goodyear contract on Thursday
and workers in Sun Prairie, Wis., approved it today, said URW
spokesman Curt Brown said.
   Workers in Madisonsville, Ky., rejected the offer Thursday, he
said.
   With the approval by Union City, the proposal appears headed for
ratification nationwide. Under URW bylaws, ratification must be
made by a majority of the locals representing a majority of the
membership.
   An earlier tentative agreement with Goodyear was rejected, and
Union City, with about 2,500 members, was one of the pivotal locals
because of its size.
   If the voting by the remaining locals follows the first
ratification vote, the three-year pact would be approved.
   ``It would appear that the improvements made to the contract
during the negotiations session May 17 turned around the vote in
Union City, Tennessee and satisfied their needs and their
concerns,'' said Brown.
   Firestone workers in six states went on strike Sunday after
union negotiators rejected Firestone's offer, saying it didn't
match an earlier agreement with Goodyear.
   Brown said a local in Danville, Va., is voting today; locals in
Akron and St. Mary's, Ohio; Lincoln, Neb.; New Bedford, Mass. vote
on Sunday; and Gadsden, Ala., on Monday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, with soybeans slightly higher, wheat
slightly lower and corn prices mixed.
   The higher soybean opening surprised many traders who had
expected a continution of Thursday's late sell-off and quieter
activity after the exchange increased margins overnight for the
second time this week.
   The price to play the grain futures market has more than doubled
since Monday, with initial margins on soybeans now $2,000 compared
to $900 on Friday. For that reason, traders expected small
speculators to shy away from the soybean market this morning.
   Many of the weaker players did take profits on Thursday. But
with forecasts calling for continued dry weather in the Midwest,
speculators were still betting that grain and soybean prices will
go higher, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``There is still very strong support here for the grains,'' he
said. ``The market did start steady to easier, but then everybody
wanted to buy it.''
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.40{ a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to { cent higher with July at $2.18 a bushel; oats were {
cent to 1 cent lower with July at $1.71\ a bushel; soybeans were 1
cent to 1} cents higher with July at $7.69 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .38 cent higher with June at
73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .30 cent
higher with May at 80.75 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .28
cent higher with June at 53.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to .60 cent higher with May at 53.20 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Thursday.

   California investor Burt Sugarman today
urged the family that controls Media General Inc. to consider
splitting the company into two or more publishing and broadcast
firms.
   Sugarman, who is engaged in a takeover bid for Richmond-based
Media General, said at the annual stockholders meeting that his
interest ``is not in taking the newspapers away'' from company
Chairman D. Tennant Bryan and his family.
   Sugarman and two associates were submitted as candidates for
election to the company's board of dierectors. Stockholders will
vote on board members today, but the results will not be announced
until later, after all proxies have been counted.
   One item not on the agenda for the meeting was Sugarman's buyout
offer. Media General officials rejected Sugarman's original
$61.50-per-share offer to buy all the company's stock. That offer
was made Feb. 29, and Sugarman has since sweetened his bid to $70 a
share.
   Sugarman and his associates own 10.1 percent of Media General
Class A stock, an investment of more than $111 million.
   Members of the Bryan family own 70 percent of the company's
Class B stock, which controls seven of the 10 board seats. The
Bryan family also owns about 12 percent of the publicly traded
Class A stock.
   Sugarman is seeking to have himself, Harold Simmons and David
Gotterer named Class A directors. Media General has recommended
that its three directors be re-elected.
   The days leading up to the annual meeting were marked by charges
and countercharges between the two parties.
   On Saturday, lawyers for Media General and Sugarman aired their
allegations of unfair tactics in the proxy battle before U.S.
District Judge Richard L. Williams. Both sides had filed motions
for injunctions to stop the opposition from delivering what they
characterized as false and misleading information to shareholders.
   Williams denied both sides' motions, calling adversaries in
proxy fights ``the world's most thin-skinned people'' and saying he
found no evidence of irreparable harm by either party. The judge
also said the proper time for the parties to assess damages was
after the annual meeting.
   Earlier this week, Media General officials said Sugarman had
offered to end his attempt to land three board seats in exchange
for control of the company's cable television franchises in Fairfax
County and Fredericksburg.
   Sugarman strongly denied ever making such an offer, and called
Media General's claim ``a desperate move to make it appear as
though we are losing the proxy contest. In my opinion, this
last-minute trick just won't work.''

<TEXT>
   Bond prices slipped in light dealings this
morning as inflation worries continued to weigh on the market
despite a new government report that consumer prices rose only
modestly in April.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond edged down [ point, or
about $1.25 for every $1,000 in face value, by midday as its yield
rose to 9.29 percent from 9.27 percent late Thursday.
   As trading got underway today, the government said consumer
prices rose 0.4 percent in April, compared with a 0.5 percent rise
in March.
   While low inflation is usually seen as good news for bond
investors, the report failed to inspire any buying in today's
market.
   That was partly because the size of the increase had been widely
expected, and partly because investors remain fearful that the
economy is growing so quickly that inflation may eventually
accelerate, analysts said.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the reaction ``is the hallmark of a
bear market.''
   ``There is some good news in the April statistics that should
allay concerns that inflation is accelerating, and the market
ignores that. It gravitates to bad news,'' he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments slipped 1-32 point, intermediate maturities fell 3-32
point and 20-year issues were off 9-32 point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, was off 0.07 at 108.68. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell
0.95 to 1,137.11.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, was up 0.02 at 274.66.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 10 basis points to
6.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 5 basis points to 6.60 percent and one-year
bills rose 4 basis points at 6.95 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7[ percent, up from 6 15-16 percent late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Nova Pharmaceutical Corp. has agreed to a joint
venture with SmithKline Beckman Corp. to develop and market a
variety of painkilling and central nervous system drugs, pending
approval from both firm's boards, Baltimore-based Nova announced.
   The preliminary agreement, estimated to be worth $72.5 million
to Nova, eventually will give Philadelphia-based SmithKline an
estimated 20 percent stake in Nova, which was founded in 1982.
   The two firms would be advancing work on a range of drugs Nova
has developed, including a class of painkillers targeted at
bradykinin, which Nova and the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions
report plays a key role in relaying pain messages to the nervous
system. The findings were reported in the current issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
   ``This is quite significant for Nova,'' Arda M. Minocherhomjee,
a health-care analyst with Cable, Howse & Ragen Inc. in Seattle,
said of the joint venture. ``It gives them access to an excellent
marketing partner, and, furthermore, it gives them the capital
needed to develop their products.''
   After the agreement was announced Thursday, Nova's stock closed
unchanged in over-the-counter trading at $8.25 a share.
   ``Nova cut a very attractive deal as far as they're concerned,''
said David M. Bartash, pharmaceutical analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds in New York. ``It's very good, and they get SmithKline to
carry some of the development costs.''
   ``You need to raise the funds when you don't need them,'' said
Dr. Hans Mueller, president and chief executive of Nova, which
analysts estimate had $2.4 million in cash and more than $15
million in available funds as of March 31, more than enough to
finance its research and development expenses this year.
   For the first quarter ended March 31, the company lost $1.4
million, compared with a loss of $2 million a year ago. Revenues
increased to $4.1 million from $1.6 million.
   Nova received Food and Drug Administration approval in January
to start clinical testing on an analgesic that blocks the
transmission of bradykinins, a powerful pain-producing substance in
the body.
   The company is conducting clinical trials on a nasal spray form
of the drug to block symptoms of the common cold and plans to seek
FDA approval to test the drug's effectiveness in relieving
inflammation and blocking burn pain.
   Analysts estimate that the potential annual market for the
analgesic could easily top $100 million three or four years after
it is released.
   Nova also is developing compounds to treat central nervous
system disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and
Huntington's chorea.
   Under the terms of the agreement, Nova and SmithKline would form
separate partnerships to develop and market the painkillers and the
central nervous system products.
   As part of the latter agreement, SmithKline would make an
immediate cash payment of $25 million to Nova in return for 2.7
million newly issued common shares and warrants to purchase 775,000
shares of SmithKline at $9.28 a share.
   SmithKline has also agreed to purchase by December 1991 $24
million worth of Nova common stock and warrants to purchase an
undisclosed number of shares at 15 percent above market price at
the time of the purchase.
   The partnership, which is to be 60 percent owned by SmithKline,
would receive the right to license SmithKline's psychiatric drugs,
including Thorazine and Stelazine _ which currently account for
about $40 million in annual revenues _ once the first central
nervous system product was marketed.
   The analgesics partnership calls for SmithKline to pay an
initial $1 million and assume $21.5 million of debt primarily to
commercialize the painkiller. SmithKline would manufacture it and
obtain exclusive worldwide marketing rights, while Nova would
retain a 50 percent share of control over that partnership and half
the profits obtained from product sales.
   ``We fully expect to take a leadership role in the evolving
field of neurobiology,'' Henry Wendt, SmithKline's chairman and
chief executive, said in a prepared statement. ``Nova's exciting
research projects, together with our drug development and marketing
capability, makes a powerful combination.''

<HEAD>British Rail Reportedly Under Study For Privatization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government is considering selling off
British Rail, the national railroad system, the Economist magazine
reported in its latest issue.
   The plan is being worked on by a policy unit within Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's office, the magazine said in its May
21 issue, which was made available Friday.
   Spokesmen for the prime minister, British Rail and the
Department of Transport said Friday they were unaware of any plans
for the privatization of the railway.
   A report in London's Evening Standard, however, said the prime
minister's office confirmed that a study of the state company's
privatization is in progress but stressed that it was at an early
stage.
   The Economist said three options are being explored. The first
is selling the entire network as a going concern. But that would be
made difficult by British Rail's current troubled financial state,
which requires government subsidies for operation.
   A second option calls for splitting British Rail into regional
companies. The magazine said this option is under study by Greg
Bourne, a special adviser in the prime minister's policy unit.
   Bourne declined to answer questions about the reports.
   The third option would be to form a ``track authority'' which
would put operation of British Rail's track and signaling hardware
up for private bidding, the magazine said.
   The Economist said plans for a split-up of British Rail into
regional companies are also being studied by the Center for Policy
Studies, a private think tank, which will publish its conclusions
next month.
   Mrs. Thatcher's government has sold off billions of pounds worth
of state assets, including British Telecom PLC, the phone company,
British Gas PLC, and British Airways PLC, since she came into power
in 1979.
   It currently is in the process of preparing the sale of the
electicity industry of England and Wales.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Up 9.6 Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
higher, but below their best levels Friday as an uncertain start to
business on Wall Street reduced London trading volume to a trickle.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 9.6
points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,770.2.
   Volume came to 493 million shares compard with 442.3 million
shares on Thursday.
   Equities continued to closely track performances in overseas
stock markets. Gains in New York on Thursday and in Tokyo earlier
Friday, pushed up the 100-share index more than 14 points in late
morning.
   But shares drifted back Friday afternoon as Wall Street
surrendered early gains and moved back into negative territory. By
the end of London trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was
barely changed on the day.
   Dealers said institutional activity was light, with selling
interest roughly offsetting purchases.
   ``U.K. institutions really aren't showing direction,'' one
dealer said.
   The market shrugged off news that British retail prices rose a
greater-than-expected 1.6 percent in April. Dealers said the
inflation figures are frequently distorted by seasonal factors in
April, the first month of Britain's fiscal year.
   London players kept a closer eye on the release of U.S.
inflation figures, but they were in line with many economists'
forecasts and ended up having little effect on London equities.
   The U.S. consumer price index gained 0.4 percent in April,
compared with an 0.5-percent increase in March.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 7.1 points at 1,415.2
at the close.
   The Financial Times 500-share index rose 5.77 points to close at
1,000.80.

<HEAD>20 Years Later, PSNH Still Faces Nuclear Hurdles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after Public Service Company
of New Hampshire announced it would build it own atomic reactor,
the ill-fated Seabrook project has become a symbol for the problems
that extinguished many of America's grandest hopes for nuclear
power.
   Public Service is the first major public power company to seek
refuge from its creditors in bankruptcy court, and there remains no
assurance that Seabrook, its pricetag now at $5.4 billion and
rising $50 million a month, ever will clear evacuation-planning
hurdles and generate electricity.
   Spokesman Nicholas Ashooh conceded this week that, with the
benefit of hindsight, Public Service would have followed a
different course if the decision to build were being made again.
   ``But that's irrelevant,'' Ashooh said. ``The bigger question
is, how can we have a regulatory system that after 20 years cannot
make a decision on a major power project?''
   Public Service narrowly averted bankruptcy in 1984, completing a
$425 million bond sale that was the largest financing in utility
industry history. But nuclear disasters _ first at Pennsylvania's
Three Mile Island in 1979 and then at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union
in 1986 _ dealt Seabrook a devastating blow.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, now the likely 1988
Democratic presidential nominee, cited Chernobyl when he decided to
oppose evacuation planning for Massachusetts communities near
Seabrook. Dukakis has since become a key obstacle, though New
Hampshire's evacuation plans also still lack final approval.
   The environment surrounding nuclear power in May 1968 and Public
Service's early experiences with it gave little clue of the
troubles that lay ahead.
   A byproduct of research that produced the atomic bomb during
World War II, nuclear power in the 1940s and 1950s was seen by many
as ``the key to the world's future,'' Christopher Flavin of the
Worldwatch Institute wrote in his 1983 report ``Nuclear Power: The
Market Test.''
   ``It would supply infinite amounts of energy indefinitely and
remove many of the constraints under which humanity had struggled
for millennia,'' Flavin wrote.
   Another early claim by nuclear proponents was that it would
provide energy too cheap to meter. Energy from New England's first
nuclear plant, Yankee Rowe in Rowe, Mass., wasn't too cheap to
meter. But it was only pennies per kilowatt-hour, cheaper than
other alternatives at the time.
   Public Service owned 7 percent of Yankee Rowe, which cost $44
million to build and began operation in 1960 as one of a half-dozen
prototype reactors nationwide funded by the U.S. government. By
1968, Public Service also had investments in other nuclear plants
operating or under construction _ Connecticut Yankee, Vermont
Yankee and Maine Yankee.
   After conducting studies that projected continued strong growth
in energy demand, Public Service decided to join dozens of other
utilities that were jumping on the nuclear bandwagon.
   New Hampshire's largest power company announced on May 20, 1968,
that it would build an 860-megawatt reactor on the Piscataqua River
in Newington, N.H. Public Service was to own 50 percent of the
plant, with United Illuminating of Connecticut to pick up most of
the rest of the tab.
   The plant was to cost $150 million and be operating commercially
by the fall of 1974, company Chairman Avery Schiller announced.
   But the federal government squelched the original plan, saying
the Newington location was too close to Pease Air Force Base.
Public Service chose an alternate site on marshland at Seabrook.
   Public Service shelved the plans in 1969 after problems arose in
financing the plant. Later, utility studies showed a need for a big
new power plant, and the company revived its nuclear plans on Feb.
1, 1972.
   The plans were subsequently revised to include two
1,150-megawatt reactors, the first to be operating commercially in
1979, the second in 1981. The total cost was estimated at $850
million.
   Although the oil crisis of 1973 heightened awareness about
energy, Seabrook began running into problems that earlier nuclear
plants had not faced. Ashooh drew a comparison between Seabrook and
Maine Yankee in Wiscasset, an 826-megawatt reactor that began
operating in 1972 at a construction cost of $239 million.
   ``They went through their environmental (impact) hearings in an
afternoon,'' Ashooh said. ``It took Seabrook several years.''
   Controversy over Seabrook's cooling-water system wasn't finally
settled until August 1978, causing years of delays and adding
hundreds of millions of dollars to the plant's cost. By then,
Seabrook also had become the target of highly visible opposition.
   Civil disobedience actions began at the plant site in 1976,
months before groundbreaking, and a May 1977 protest that ended
with 1,414 arrests _ the largest at any U.S. nuclear plant at that
time _ made Seabrook the focus of the nation's anti-nuclear
movement.
   As further delays kept boosting the project's pricetag, interest
rates skyrocketed in the late 1970s, and Public Service's financial
health deteriorated.
   In the aftermath of the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island,
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission enacted rules that now represent
the final major obstacle to a commercial license for Seabrook,
requiring approved evacuation plans for a 10-mile zone around all
nuclear power plants.
   Also in the spring of 1979, New Hampshire Gov. Hugh Gallen
signed a law barring utilities from charging ratepayers for power
plants before they operate.

   Stock prices were mixed today in quiet trading,
which brokers described as a brief pause following the market's
declines earlier this week over fears of higher inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 1.16 points
to 1,959.88 as of 2 p.m. EDT. Broader market indices were mixed.
   Gaining issues narrowly led declines on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 722 up, 594 down and 544 unchanged. Volume on the
Big Board totaled 76.82 million shares with two hours of trading

   The government reported today that consumer prices rose 0.4
percent in April. Although that level was widely anticipated by
economists and traders, it substantiated some anxiety about
inflation that has been haunting the market.
   As with other recent sessions, NYSE volume was partly inflated
by trading strategies aimed at capturing dividends of selected
stocks. The Big Board's most active issue was a dividend trade,
Ohio Edison at 17}, down [. More than 4 million shares were traded.
   Among other active NYSE issues, Texaco fell 1] to 48. There were

<HEAD>Dollar Rises In Quiet European Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: AMs version expected by 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in lackluster European trading
Friday. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said trading was extremely thin and quiet, partly
because many traders on the Continent went home early before a
three-day weekend.
   ``You could hear a pin drop in the trading room today,'' said
one dealer at a British merchant bank.
   The dollar's slight gains were due to a flurry of buying in the
morning after Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's parliament,
reiterated that his country was at war with the United States and
called for an arms buildup.
   The dollar jumped up on the report. But then it barely moved for
several hours until it edged back late in the day, dealers said.
   One dealer said market players did not take the report seriously
but that it gave them something to do.
   The dollar was not affected by news that the U.S. consumer price
index rose 0.4 percent in April because the rise was in line with
expectations, dealers said.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. The
pound fell to $1.8615 from $1.8665 late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose fractionally to a closing 124.82 yen from 124.80
yen late Thursday. Later, in London, it was quoted at 124.85 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.7030 West German marks, up from 1.6990; 1.4195 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4155; 5.7560 French francs, up from 5.7542;
1.9070 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9042; 1,263.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,262.00; and 1.2420 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2442.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 45 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid
$458.01 an ounce.
   Later gold fell in London to a late bid price of $455.20 a troy
ounce from late Thursday's $456.90. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid
$455.50 a troy ounce compared with $458.00 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.64 a troy ounce, compared
with late Thursday's $6.72 an ounce.

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter warned Friday that the sharp narrowing in the nation's
trade deficit in March does not necessarily signal a trend.
   The gap narrowed to $9.75 billion from $13.83 billion in
February, catching the markets and some government officials off
guard.
   Yeutter, the top U.S. trade official, said the improvement was a
``pleasant surprise,'' but said he preferred to look at quarterly
averages, which give a better idea of trends.
   ``We have to be concerned that this isn't an aberration,'' he
said.
   Yeutter said a $1.3 billion rise in U.S. imports to $38.7
billion did raise concern.
   He called on foreign firms to ``stop dumping'' but added: ``We'd
have a healthy situation if our consumer demand were a bit less
strong.''
   Yeutter was in Zurich during a European trip to address the
Swiss Farmers' Union.

<HEAD>Bregman Partners May Seek Control of Multifoods, Filing Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bregman Partners, which broke off takeover
talks with International Multifoods Corp. on Thursday, said it
still may launch a tender offer for the food giant, government
documents show.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday, Bregman Partners said it may ``seek control of the
company through negotiations with the board of directors and
management, through a tender offer,'' or through the purchase of
additional shares of Multifoods stock.
   But the filing, which contained a laundry list of alternatives,
also stated the group may simply opt to sell its Multifoods
holdings.
   Last December Bregman Partners disclosed in an SEC filing that
it held 10.7 percent of International Multifoods' outstanding
common stock. Earlier, it had sought federal government clearance
to raise its stake to as high as 25 percent.
   Bregman Partners said in its Thursday filing that it has
``contacted several third parties regarding their possible interest
in providing financing'' for a takeover of Multifoods. The Canadian
group also said it has contacted a number third parties that may be
interested in buying certain Multifoods business units.
   Bregman Partners, which consists mainly of the Bregman family of
Toronto and Belzberg banking family of Vancouver, said last year it
might seek control of International Multifoods, an international
food manufacturer and distributor.
   The Minneapolis-based company said Thursday it had received a
letter from Bregman Partners ending the Canadian group's
consideration of an acquisition and thus terminating a standstill
agreement between the two concerns.
   Bregman Partners had agreed not to purchase additional
International Multifoods shares while negotiations were under way.
   The company has said it would oppose any takeover attempt by
Bregman Partners, and in October filed suit alleging that the
partnership had illegally caused speculation in its stock and filed
misleading government disclosure statements.

   Pennzoil Co. said Friday that 95 percent of
Facet Enterprises Inc.'s common stock has been tendered into its
$32-a-share cash offer for the filter maker.
   The $250 million offer expired at 11 p.m. Thursday, and more
than 5.7 million Facet shares were tendered by the deadline, the
oil giant said.
   Tulsa-based Facet sought Pennzoil as a ``white knight'' to help
fight off hostile bidder Prospect Group Inc.
   The Facet board rejected a $27.50-a-share offer from Prospect
and instituted anti-takeover provisions. Prospect dropped its $199
million bid shortly after Pennzoil came on the scene.
   Facet is Houston-based Pennzoil's first acquisition since it
received $3 billion in cash from Texaco Inc. as settlement in their
four-year legal dispute over control of Getty Oil Co.
   Pennzoil officials have said, however, that the Facet purchase
is not part of their strategy for using that money. Pennzoil
officials will meet next month to discuss further acquisitions.
   Pennzoil, Facet's largest customer, has said it will operate the
company from its current headquarters as a separate entity.
   As part of the deal, Pennzoil reportedly will assume $50 million
in Facet debt, which resulted mostly from its $67 million
acquisition of Purolator Products Inc. last year.
   Facet President James Malone said the company would be in a
better position to accelerate its expansion plans under Pennzoil
control.
   Facet is considering acquisitions _ in the aviation and auto
filter businesses as well as in the medical and food filtration
businesses _ to help boost its annual revenue from the current $350
million to $1 billion by 1990, Malone said.

<TEXT>
   Lazarus, a division of Federated Department
Stores Inc., announced Friday it is laying off 1,200 employees as a
result of Federated's purchase by Campeau Corp. of Canada.
   Lazarus, a Cincinnati-based department store group, said 600
employees will lose their jobs in the company's central
organization and the remaining 600 will be laid off from the 43
stores and regional organization. Lazarus has 15,000 employees and
operates in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia and Michigan.
   All of the employees will know their status by June 11, company
officials said. Those laid off will be given severance money and
benefits and will be offered help finding jobs elsewhere, Lazarus
said in a statement.
   The layoffs are part of a ``streamlining plan'' developed by the
Lazarus management team, the company said.
   Beth Charlton, public relations spokeswoman for Lazarus, said
she could not discuss details of the severance packages for those
being laid off.
   Asked whether there will be further layoffs, Ms. Charlton said,
``I have no way of telling that, but this is all that's been given
to us.''
   ``The reduction of approximately 1,200 associates is due to the
uncertain retail environment that the Midwest has experienced since
last October, to streamline structural problems resulting from two
mergers and an acquisition, and the need to service the financial
cost of the purchase of Federated,'' Lazarus said in its statement.
   Campeau Corp., headed by Canadian businessman Robert Campeau,
recently won the right to buy the Cincinnati-based Federated for
$6.6 billion, ending a takeover battle begun Jan. 25. Campeau
Corp., a Toronto-based development company, bought Allied Stores
Corp. in December 1986. Federated operates more than 650 stores
nationwide and had 1987 sales of $11 billion.
   Campeau has said its costs of the Federated purchase, including
borrowing money for the deal, will be more than $8 billion.
   Prior to the takeover battle, Federated had consolidated its
retail operations in 1986 and 1987 by merging eight of its store
groups, including Lazarus, into three retail units. The other store
groups involved were Foley's, Sanger Harris, Levy's, Shillito's,
Rike's, Gold Circle and Richway.

<HEAD>Farmers Has Hands Full In Warding Off Takeover Bid, Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Group Inc. faces a
difficult challenge in attempting to defeat BAT Industries' $4.5
billion takeover bid, the insurer's chairman said Friday.
   The $63-a-share offer is ``perhaps the test of Farmers'
mettle,'' Leo E. Denlea Jr., Farmers' chairman, told about 500
people attending the company's annual meeting here.
   The offer by BAT and its American subsidiary, Batus Inc., has
been vigorously opposed by management at Farmers, the nation's
third-largest home and auto insurance company and the
seventh-largest property and casualty insurer.
   Denlea warned shareholders against becoming confused by the
offer.
   ``Farmers' record is unparalleled. We are supremely confident we
can continue to enhance shareholder value in the future,'' Denlea
said.
   Results of a non-binding shareholder resolution proposed by
Batus, which urged Farmers' board to negotiate, will not be
available for at least a week, Denlea said.
   Also addressing Farmers' shareholders was BAT's chairman, Pat
Sheehy. He agreed with Denlea's upbeat forecast for Farmers and
reiterated earlier statements that BAT would pay substantially more
than $63 a share if Farmers would only negotiate.
   ``We want to buy Farmers because it's a first-class organization
that has excellent growth prospects,'' Sheehy said.
   ``We are pleased with the support that we received from Farmers
Group shareholders on our resolution recommending the Farmers'
directors reconsider their refusal to negotiate with us,'' Sheehy
said. ``We look forward to receiving the actual tally.''
   Batus, a diversified company whose better-known interests
include Kool cigarettes and Saks Fifth Avenue stores, said Thursday
about 18 percent of the company's shareholders had offered to sell
their stock to Batus at the offered price of $63 a share.
   The outcome of the proxy vote may not be known for some days,
because anything other than an obviously overwhelming vote one way
or the other will have to be independently verified, said Jerry
Faulwell, Farmers vice president and treasurer.
   The battle for control of the company has been spirited, with
Farmers criticizing BAT for doing business in South Africa and
suggesting its tobacco holdings make it unfit to control an
insurance company that gives non-smoker discounts.
   Louisville-based Batus, for its part, has responded by pointing
out that Farmers has invested $200 million of the money collected
from policy holders in U.S. companies that do business in South
Africa.
   Batus has committed to maintaining non-smoker discounts, and
points out that British insurers owned by BAT Industries have
instituted non-smoking rates since BAT acquired them. BAT does less
than 1 percent of its business in South Africa and subscribes to
Common Market guidelines for such businesses aimed at bettering the
lot of blacks under apartheid, spokesmen have said.
   Batus owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., maker of Kool,
Viceroy, Raleigh and Belair cigarettes, and retailers including
Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's. It also owns Appleton
Papers Inc.

   Grain and soybean futures closed higher Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans up sharply on fears of
continued dry weather.
   Weekend weather forecasts were mixed, but even the most
optimistic outlooks called for scattered showers to bring only
slight moisture to parts of the Corn Belt, analysts said.
   With soybean stockpiles declining, a poor crop this year could
lead to tight supplies next year.
   ``My weatherman is the market and the market says we're not
going to get much rain this weekend, so that's what I'm going by,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   But if more rain should fall than expected this weekend, grain
and soybean prices probably would plummet on Monday, Lespinasse
said.
   ``It's a very nervous market,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 5\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.46{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 3} cents higher with July at $2.21\ a bushel; oats
were \ cent lower to 1\ cents higher with July at $1.73 a bushel;
soybeans were unchanged to 12 cents higher with July at $7.80 a

   Stock prices closed mostly lower today in some
of the lightest trading this year, capping a loss-riddled week in
which apathy and tension over higher interest rates dominated the
market.
   ``It's just a continuation of complete lack of interest by the
public,'' said John Muldowney, head of equity trading at the
Richmond, Va. investment firm of Scott & Stringfellow Inc.
   Although the market showed little reaction to a government
report that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in April, the figure
helped substantiate existing fear that higher inflation is
inevitable.
   Since inflation means higher interest rates, yields in the bond
market rose and became an increasingly attractive alternative to
stocks, driving prices lower.

<HEAD>Canada Won't Withdraw From Free Trade Pact, Minister Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada won't withdraw from a proposed free-trade
agreement even if the United States carries through with proposals
to restrict imports of Canadian lobster and plywood, Trade Minister
John Crosbie said Friday.
   Crosbie told the Commons he has sent diplomatic notes to
Washington and telephoned U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
in Paris to protest recommendations by the Senate Finance Committee
which Canada says would violate the agreement negotiated last fall.
   Yeutter is in Paris for an international economic meeting.
   But Crosbie shied away from opposition demands that he threaten
to kill the deal unless the Americans back down.
   ``When we encounter a problem we don't throw up our hands and
withdraw altogether and leave chaos in its place,'' Crosbie told
the Commons.
   Crosbie said if the United States doesn't eliminate the
provisions from its legislation, Canada could take the issue to the
bilateral trade panels, which would be set up under free trade to
settle disputes, or could take ``counter-measures'' _ presumably
restrictions on American goods.
   Under the free-trade deal to take effect in January, Canada and
the United States would phase out tariffs and a wide range of other
barriers.
   However, both the Canadian Parliament and the full U.S. Congress
must still approve the necessary legislation. Crosbie said he
intends to introduce the Canadian legislation in the Commons on
Tuesday.
   Liberal leader John Turner and New Democratic Party leader Ed
Broadbent both prodded Crosbie to draw a firm line against any
concessions the United States wants to add to the free-trade deal.
   ``Just for once will this government stand up for Canadian
interests before something is done against us instead of after?''
said Broadbent.
   Crosbie replied: ``What is it you want _ do you want me to go
down there with a machine gun?''

<HEAD>Pilots Say Eastern to Cut Back Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially strapped Eastern Airlines will cut back
its operations by nearly 20 percent starting this summer, its
pilots union says.
   The Air Line Pilots Association said Eastern officials told
union representatives of the plans at an April 29 meeting during
discussion of pilots' scheduling, The Miami Herald reported in
Friday's editions.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the 20 percent ``is a
speculative figure.''
   ``That's from ALPA,'' she said. ``We haven't determined or
finalized our flying plans beyond July.''
   But Eastern, a subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp., said in its
most recent quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission that more cutbacks and losses are imminent.
   ``In anticipation of continuing losses, Eastern is considering
and anticipating a further downsizing of the operations,'' said the
report made public this week.
   Eastern sustained a net loss of $30.9 million in the first
quarter.
   The union representing some 3,500 Eastern pilots said they were
told by Eastern that the planned flight reductions stem from a
worsening pilot shortage, a huge backlog of pilot vacations
postponed by the company to keep planes flying and a ``training
logjam'' on A300 and Boeing 757 jetliners.
   According to union calculations, Eastern would operate 56,812
block hours this September, down sharply from 78,236 this month. A
block hour measures how long it takes a plane to taxi and fly from
one airport to another. Flight levels have not been that low since
1968, the pilots said.
   ALPA said, though, there was no indication that Eastern would
lay off more workers to adjust for the cutbacks.
   The union also said Eastern estimates it has lost 1,037 pilots
since July 1986. A total of 392 will have been hired, for a net
reduction of 645. Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the carrier
has enough pilots to meet its planned schedules.
   Employment at Eastern has been slashed from 40,000 to around
32,000 workers since Eastern's 1986 takeover by Texas Air.

<HEAD>Judge To Rule Monday on Murray Ohio Hostile Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARGARET HABERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Friday that he
would rule after the financial markets close Monday on Murray Ohio
Manufacturing Co.'s attempt to block a $182 million hostile
takeover by AB Electrolux of Sweden.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman said he would review the
case over the weekend before ruling on Murray Ohio's request for a
preliminary injunction against the Swedish appliance manufacturer.
   Murray Ohio produces lawn mowers and bicycles.
   A five-day hearing had focused on the New York law firm Sullivan
& Cromwell, which represented AB Electrolux in its $48-a-share
offer made May 6. But the firm also offered advice in 1987 to
Murray Ohio on strategy for fighting takeovers, testimony showed.
   In closing arguments, Murray Ohio attorney Robert J. Walker
contended that the huge Electrolux benefited from inside
information provided by Sullivan & Cromwell.
   Walker said the law firm was privy to sensitive information
about Murray Ohio, including financial projections and takeover
tactics.
   He said Neil Anderson, a Sullivan & Cromwell partner advising AB
Electrolux on the takeover, knew that his firm had confidential
information about Murray Ohio in its files,
   Anderson then told Daniel R. Elliott, an AB Electrolux vice
president, of the existence of the information and then advised the
Swedish company on what price to offer for Murray Ohio's shares,
Walker said.
   ``He (Elliott) was being told how to bet by one who knew,'' he
said.
   But AB Electrolux attorney William G. McGuinness said his
clients were ``innocent bystanders.''
   He said that no witness, including those from Murray Ohio,
testified about any specific insider information being given to AB
Electrolux.
   In addition, he said thousands of pages of files produced for
the hearing offered no evidence that Electrolux ever used
confidential information to analyze Murray Ohio for the takeover.
   The analysis was based on public sources, he said.
   ``If Electrolux had any inside information ... you would think
some of it would be documented somewhere,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cap Cities-ABC Plans To Buy Back 1 Million Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc., the broadcasting and
entertainment giant, said Friday it intends to buy back up to 1
million of its 16.2 million shares of common stock currently
outstanding.
   The company said it would make the purchases from time to time
on the open market.
   The company said it intended to hold the stock in its treasury
so it would be available for issuance under employee stock
incentive plans and other corporate purposes.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Capital Cities-ABC
fell $2 a share to $305.
   The company operates the ABC Television Network and eight
television stations, six radio networks and 21 radio stations. It
provides programming for cable television, publishes nine daily
newspapers, weekly newspapers and shopping guides and distributes
information from electronic databases.
   It earned $279.1 million, or $16.46 a share, in 1987, compared
with $181.9 million, or $11.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose 8 percent to $4.4 billion from $4.1 billion.
   In the first quarter, Capital Cities-ABC reported a profit of
$70.3 million, or $4.16 a share, compared with $23.9 million, or
$1.43 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 34 percent to $1.29
billion from $959.2 million.

   Income tax payments in April helped shrink the
federal budget deficit, but the monthly surplus was less than a
year ago, leaving government red ink so far this year 24.6 percent
higher than 1987, the Treasury Department said Friday.
   The April surplus of $13.9 billion, representing the difference
between what the government took in and what it spent last month,
helped hold the deficit for the first seven months of the fiscal
year to $105.0 billion.
   But that figure was much higher than the $84.3 billion in red
ink during the first seven months of fiscal year 1987, when the
total annual deficit eventually amounted to $150.2 billion.
   Economists say the April report indicates the Reagan
administration will have a tough time meeting its goal of a $146.7
billion deficit for fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30, or even the
Congressional Budget Office projection of $157 billion.
   Michael K. Evans, head of an economic forcasting service in
Washington, said the April report indicates the deficit for the
year will be between $170 billion and $175 billion.
   ``April's the big month. After that, it's all arithmetic. ...
The belief that it was going to stay below $150 billion was just
pure fiction,'' he said.
   The 1988 deficit target in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law is $144 billion. Budget Director James C. Miller III warned
Congress on Tuesday that an across-the-board cut in federal
programs, which would occur in October under the law, was
``perilously close.''
   The April surplus, bolstered by $53.3 billion in individual
income tax payments, was about $5 billion less than expected by
private economists. They had been waiting for the report to see
what effect the new income tax law would have. Some had thought the
new tax law would provide a small windfall.
   However, Evans said the average, median taxpayer enjoyed a tax
cut.
   ``People who used deductions and shelters paid more than they
did the year before, but the rank and file paid less,'' he said.
   April income tax collections were 25.8 percent less than the
same month a year earlier, which was inflated by the rush to take
capital gains in 1986 before the favorable rates on that kind of
income disappeared under the new tax law.
   Personal income tax collections of $237.6 billion for the first
seven months of the fiscal year are running 2.7 percent behind last
year. However, that has been offset somewhat by corporate income
tax collections of $50.6 billion, 8.4 percent greater than last
year.
   In April, all government revenue totaled $109.3 billion, 11.0
percent lower than April 1987. Spending totaled $95.4 billion, 13.6
percent ahead of the same month a year earlier.
   For the first seven months, revenues totaled $522.1 billion, up
3 percent over 1987, while spending was $627.1 billion, up 6.1
percent from the same period a year ago.
   As usual, the largest spending categories in April were the
military, followed by Social Security, other programs in the
Department of Health and Human Services and interest on the
national debt.
   Military spending totaled $26.1 billion last month and $168.4
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 6.3 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $16.3 billion last month
and $121.3 billion for the past seven months, up 5.7 percent from
the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. Social Security is
exempted from budget limitations under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law and most months has been showing faster
spending increases than the other categories.
   The other programs in the Department of Health and Human
Services, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent $15.7 billion in
April and $93.2 billion so far this budget year, a 6.5 percent
increase over 1987.
   Interest on the $2.5 trillion national debt totaled $14.9
billion last month and $120.1 billion so far this fiscal year, an
increase of 9.5 percent over the same period last year.

   The Pentagon selected four contractor teams
Friday to develop a new type of high-speed, gallium arsenide
computer chip.
   The three-year contracts, ranging in value from $49 million to
about $69 million, call for each team to design, fabricate, package
and test the same type of computer chip. Each team, however, is
pursuing development of the chip with an eye toward its use in
different weapons or communications systems, the Pentagon said.
   The chips ``are expected to be of great value for radar,
electronic warfare, communications and smart munitions systems,''
the Pentagon said.
   It said the four contracts were awarded by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, under a program known as MIMIC
_ Microwave-Millimeter-Wave Monolithic Integrated Circuits.
   The four contractor teams are led by the Martin-Marietta Corp.
and ITT Corp.; TRW Inc.; Raytheon Co. and Texas Instruments Inc.,
and Hughes Aircraft Co. and General Electric Co.
   The Martin-Marietta-ITT team includes four other partners and
received a contract totaling $49.3 million. The TRW team includes
three other partners and received a contract worth $57.5 million.
The Raytheon-Texas Instruments team includes eight other partners
and received a contract totaling $68.6 million. And the Hughes-GE
team includes seven other partners and received a contract worth
$50 million.

   Hundreds of General Motors Corp. retirees marched
outside GM's annual shareholders meeting Friday to protest changes
in health-care benefits they say discriminate against salaried
workers.
   ``We retirees all retired with what we thought was an implied, a
moral and a legal contract that we would have our health insurance
benefits for life,'' said Leonard Moeller, a retiree who lives in
Grand Blanc.
   ``What right does General Motors have to discriminate against
salaried GM employees?'' he said.
   Of GM's 309,000 retirees, about 84,000 were salaried workers.
Hourly workers' pensions and other retirement benefits are
negotiated by the United Auto Workers union, which does not
represent salaried workers.
   In July, GM will change its health care plan for salaried
workers _ both active and retired _ to encourage the use health
maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations over
GM's traditional Blue Cross-Blue Shield health insurance by forcing
users of the traditional plan to pay deductibles and half of each
monthly premium.
   Single salaried workers will be required to pay $200
deductibles, families will pay $250, and both pay 20 percent of the
next $2,500 in medical charges.
   Workers who opt for HMOs and PPOs pay no deductibles or premiums
and only 30 percent of charges for each office visit, said John D.
Butler, GM's general director of employee benefits.
   GM also moved vision and hearing care from separate plans that
covered all costs into its optional comprehensive coverage, which
has deductibles and premium cost-sharing, Butler said.
   Butler said Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. made similar
changes in 1984. Only 13 percent of GM salaried workers now
participate in managed health care plans. None of the changes
affects hourly workers.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith said the company made the changes to
stem costs and halt abuses. GM spent $2.9 billion on employee and
retiree health care in 1987 and faces higher costs in the future as
its work force ages and the number of active workers supporting
each retiree shrinks.
   Separately, GM increased salaried pensions by $850 a year.
Butler said the increases will total $3,400 by 1990, while the
changes in the health care plan could cost salaried workers and
retirees $750 a year.
   ``We are No. 1 in benefits literally in the world by almost any
measure,'' Smith said. He said the retirees' anger ``would be an
easy thing to fix ... next time it comes around, we don't put the
money in cash, we put it back in the benefits. But that means the
people who don't use the benefits are going to get hurt and the
people who do use them, or abuse them, are going to be better off.
That's what we tried to avoid.''
   A typical GM salaried employee who retired at age 65 in 1985
receives about $40,400 a year in pension benefits and Social
Security payments, Butler said. Smith said GM retirees earn more
than 66 percent of active workers in the United States.
   At a news conference after the nearly five-hour meeting, Smith
also told reporters GM spent $3 billion on buyer incentives in
1987, which helped improve GM's share of the U.S. vehicle market to
37.4 percent in first-quarter 1988 from 33.4 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   Smith said he believes any savings from eliminating incentives
would be overcome by resulting lost sales.
   Smith also said GM hasn't decided whether it will need
additional plant closings to shrink the company's production
capacity to fit its market share, which is still well below the 45
percent GM held several years ago.

influence of dividend-capture trading in selected stocks, the
volume would have been substantially lighter.
   ``It's just a continuation of complete lack of interest by the
public,'' said John Muldowney, head of equity trading at the
Richmond, Va. investment firm of Scott & Stringfellow Inc.
   The government reported that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in
April. Although that level was widely anticipated by economists and
traders, it substantiated some anxiety about inflation that haunted
the market all week.
   This concern pushed yields on the key 30-year Treasury bond to
the 9.34 percent Friday, the highest of the year, making bonds an
increasingly attractive and less risky alternative to stocks.
   ``The market has said something loud and clear: I'm going to
attach myself to the tail of the bond market,'' said Stephen
Shobin, a vice president and market analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co.
in New York.
   Nevertheless, Shobin said he saw the potential for a stock
rally, arguing that fears over inflation are highly exaggerated and
that any further substantial rise in interest rates is unlikely.
   ``I think the market has very little vulnerability here,''
Shobin said. ``The level of fear is very high right now, but fear
is very fashionable. The market rarely rewards what the Street
considers fashionable.''
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3-to-2 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 841 issues up, 605
down and 514 unchanged.
   Among the most prominent Big Board issues, Texaco fell 1~ to 45|

   Investor Burt Sugarman, apparently conceding
that his $1.8 billion bid for Media General Inc. has stalled, on
Friday suggested splitting the communications firm into two or more
parts.
   Speaking at the company's annual shareholders meeting, Sugarman
also played down the bitter proxy fight he has waged with Media
General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan over the election of directors to
the company's board.
   ``The questions that I have are not based on personalities,''
Sugarman said. ``It's time to get down to business ... Let's meet
together. Let's talk together.''
   Bryan, whose family owns 71 percent of Media General's powerful
Class B shares, presided at the meeting but did not respond to
Sugarman's offer to negotiate. Bryan has said the family's stake in
the company is not for sale.
   Sugarman, who controls about 10 percent of the company's Class A
shares, initially offered $61.50 a share, but later boosted his bid
to $70 a share.
   Subsequently, he and two allies have challenged three directors
seeking re-election to Media General's nine-member board.
   Sugarman told the stockholders that his slate would be fair to
the Bryans and would seek to split the company's assets in a way
that preserved the family's publishing concerns. ``My interest is
not in taking the newspapers away'' from the Bryans, he said.
   In addition to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News
Leader, the Tampa Tribune and other daily and weekly newspapers,
Media General owns several television stations and cable television
operations.
   Bryan, meanwhile, received a lengthy ovation from the crowd of
about 400 shareholders when he read his own name for re-election to
the board.
   Because of delays in counting proxy votes, the tally on the
election of directors will not be released until May 27. But Media
General President and Chief Executive Officer James R. Evans, said
``based on the proxies that we have received, we believe the
incumbent ... directors have defeated Sugarman and his dissident
slate.''
   Sugarman, however, said after the two-hour meeting that he
believed the vote was nearly even. ``I think you'll find I was not
the only shareholder who voted for our slate,'' he said.
   But several shareholders said Sugarman's proposal to split the
company indicated some doubt about his chances.
   Still, Sugarman said his $70-per-share bid still stands.
   Media General closed Thursday at $42.62{ a share. ``Look at the
disparity in those numbers,'' he said.
   The stock dropped $1.12{ a share Friday to close at $41.37{ on
the American Stock Exchange.
   Sugarman criticized the two-tier stock arrangement and said he
was seeking congressional action to eliminate such structures. Last
month a federal district court in Richmond rejected Sugarman's
challenge to the system.
   Like several media companies including the New York Times Co.
and the Washington Post Co., Media General has two classes of stock
to keep control of the company in the hands of a few. While there
are fewer Class B shares outstanding, those shares are more
powerful than the Class A shares.
   Under Media General's arrangement, the Bryan family controls the
election of a majority of the board through its Class-B shares.
   Sugarman is chairman of the California-based Barris Industries,
which produces ``The Dating Game'' and other popular television
game shows and the South Carolina-based Giant Group Ltd., a cement
company.

<HEAD>Platinum Surges As Inflation Signals Strengthen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices jumped more than $11 a troy ounce
Friday, leading other precious metals higher as key indicators
reinforced ideas that inflation is worsening, analysts said.
   On other markets, most livestock and meat futures gained; the
pork markets received some startling news about supplies; grains
and soybeans advanced; energy futures were mixed; and stock index
futures retreated.
   A combination of inflationary signals and indications of
economic growth have made platinum the leader of the
precious-metals complex because platinum is used as both an
industrial metal and a hedge against inflation, analysts said.
   Friday's government report showing a 0.4 percent increase in
consumer prices in April supported the metals rally on Friday. But
the real boost came late in the day when a sudden surge in soybean
and grain futures prices propelled the Commodity Research Bureau's
price index of 21 commodities up sharply.
   With Friday's 1.31-point gain, the CRB index for May delivery
ended the week at 246.11, up 6.81 points from the previous Friday's
close on the New York Futures Exchange.
   ``That's really a fantastic move,'' said Craig Sloane, metals
analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York. ``All
these things _ commodity prices, strength of the economy _ they're
all feeding into why the metals are beginning to move.''
   Platinum settled $11.10 to $11.20 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in July at
$568.60 a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold was 50 cents to 70
cents higher with June at $458.70 a troy ounce; silver was 7.5
cents to 7.9 cents higher with May at $6.69 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mostly higher in light,
pre-weekend trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. But a
government cold-storage report released after the close prompted
predictions that pork futures would open lower on Monday.
   The Agriculture Department said the number of hams in cold
storage nearly doubled during April to 51.6 million pounds. That
compares with 24 million pounds on April 1 and 11.3 million pounds
on May 1, 1987.
   The USDA said the total amount of pork in cold storage was up 82
percent from last year, including 102.5 million pounds of frozen
pork bellies, the third-largest May 1 total ever, said Chuck
Levitt, an analysts in Chicago with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The large stocks of frozen pork won't have an immediate impact
on futures prices but will begin exerting heavy price pressure in
July, when demand for pork products typically outstrips the supply
of fresh meat, Levitt said.
   Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June
at 73.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent
higher with May at 80.90 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to
.35 cent higher with June at 53.87 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .75 cent lower to .37 cent higher with May at 53.25
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures closed higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade with soybeans up sharply on fears of continued dry weather.
   Weekend weather forecasts were mixed, but even the most
optimistic outlooks called for scattered showers to bring only
slight moisture to parts of the Corn Belt, analysts said.
   With soybean stockpiles declining, a poor crop this year could
lead to tight supplies next year.
   The National Weather Service, in a six-to-10 day outlook issued
after the close, predicted warm temperatures and normal rainfall
for most of the Midwest during the latter half of next week and the
Memorial Day weekend.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 5\ cents higher with July at $3.46{ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 3} cents higher with July at $2.21\ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with July at $1.73} a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 11} cents higher with July at
$7.78} a bushel.
   Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as the contract for June delivery of crude oil expired at
$17.17 a barrel.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled unchanged to 8 cents
higher with July at $17.70 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent lower
to .11 cent higher with June at 47.71 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .12 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 52.36
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled .20 point lower at 252.70.

   Steel company executives and industry analysts
say downward pressure on wages has eased, but savings from other
production costs are still top priorities.
   Even at LTV Steel Co., which is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws, ``there's not been tremendous pressure

said.
   His and other statements were made Thursday at the American Iron

<HEAD>Judge Grants Limited Extension in Bankruptcy Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY MITMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday
granted Public Service Company of New Hampshire at least four extra
months to come up with a reorganization plan, and may grant another
two months after that.
   After a seven-hour hearing, Judge James Yacos said he doubted he
would grant the utility the eight months it had requested.
   But he said the utility was entitled at least to a four-month
extension because ``the first 120 days have been used for
organization in a rather unique case.
   ``Realistically, (Public Service) is only now in a position they
would be in the first few weeks of a normal case,'' Yacos said.
   Federal bankruptcy law gives a debtor the exclusive right to
propose a reorganization plan for 120 days after it files for
protection from creditors. The exclusivity period for Public
Service _ the state's largest electric utility and main owner of
the stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant _ ends May 27.
   It had asked for an eight-month extension, citing the complexity
and uniqueness of the case.
   Yacos said he would consider lengthening the extension later if
he was assured that parties involved in the reorganization had
adequate access to information needed to develop and negotiate a
plan.
   Yacos said he either would grant a four-month extension with a
hearing in September to consider more time, or would grant a
six-month extension with a hearing in September to be certain that
necessary information is being made available to all involved.
   Several lawyers representing other parties to the bankruptcy had
proposed shorter extension periods.
   But Yacos said he was not convinced that it yet was appropriate
to open up the reorganization process to other proposals, although
he noted that ``one way to make things move is to make them
concrete, put them on the table.''
   Public Service sought bankruptcy protection because of financial
problems stemming from its 36 percent share of the $5.4 billion
Seabrook plant. It blames its woes largely on political opposition
to Seabrook and a state law barring the company from charging
customers for the plant until it operates commercially, which had
forced the company to borrow heavily.

<TEXT>
   AMAX Inc. said Friday it has repurchased
15.2 million shares from Chevron Corp. for $23 each, or about $350
million.
   A statement from the companies said Chevron has a one-time
option to request additional payment for the shares over the next
two years if AMAX stock rises above $23 a share, with a ceiling of
$28 a share.
   Chevron, which acquired its interest in AMAX in 1975, was the
largest shareholder in the metals, oil and gas company.
   Analysts said the move highlights Chevron's interest in focusing
on its basic oil businesses.
   Jordan Estra, vice president of S.G. Warbug & Co. in New York,
said, ``What it really means is Chevron is focusing its effort back
to its basic businesses and its interest in diversification is
diminished.''
   Alan Born, president and chief executive officer of AMAX, said
the company will have to borrow to finance the repurchase, but he
expected the funds to be repaid from the current year's cash flow.
   ``AMAX has completed a number of major steps to improve its
profitability and potential and is experiencing significant
improvement in its operating results,'' Born said. ``This share
purchase will not dilute the earnings of AMAX's remaining
shareholders.
   ``We are currently expecting AMAX's net income in 1988 to be in
the order of $4 per share and with this purchase of shares, those
expected earnings should increase to about $4.25 per share,'' he
said.
   The repurchase represents Chevron's total holdings in AMAX.
   Although corporate headquarters for AMAX are in New York, the
company's headquarters for its metals businesses are in Greenwich.
Chevron is headquartered in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Four Union Locals Ok Goodyear Settlement; Firestone Strike
Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at four Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
plants approved a contract settlement, among them a key
2,500-member local union in Tennessee that had rejected an earlier
contract proposal, a union spokesman said Friday.
   Voting by six union locals is scheduled through Monday on the
tentative settlement reached by Goodyear and the United Rubber
Workers union shortly before a noon strike deadline last Tuesday.
   The URW represents 15,000 workers at 11 of Goodyear's 42 U.S.
plants.
   Meanwhile, a walkout by 4,700 Firestone Inc. union workers in
six states continued for a sixth day Friday. URW spokesman Curt
Brown said the union's president, Milan Stone, has asked
negotiators to return to the bargaining table in Akron on Saturday.
The talks will be the first in a week.
   Firestone spokesman Mike Connor confirmed that talks would
resume.
   URW workers in Union City, Tenn.; Marysville, Ohio; and Topeka,
Kan., voted in favor of the proposed Goodyear contract on Thursday
and workers in Sun Prairie, Wis., approved it Friday, Brown said.
   Workers in Madisonville, Ky., rejected the offer Thursday with
54 percent voting against the proposal, he said. Brown did not
release vote totals.
   The approval by the Union City local could be a key to its
ratification nationwide because of its size. Under URW bylaws,
ratification must be made by a majority of the locals representing
a majority of the membership.
   Firestone workers went on strike Sunday after union negotiators
rejected Firestone's offer, saying it didn't match the first
agreement with Goodyear, which was intended to served as a pattern
for Firestone.
   Firestone officials contended their latest offer was equal to
the Goodyear pattern. The Akron-based URW represents Firestone
workers in Noblesville, Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.;
Russellville, Akr.; Oklahoma City and Akron.
   Goodyear and the union reached its first tentative settlement on
April 21, but it was rejected a week later.

<TEXT>
   Lucky Stores Inc. has agreed to be acquired
by American Stores Co. for $2.5 billion in cash in a deal that
would create one of the nation's biggest supermarket concerns, both
companies announced Friday.
   At the same time, Lucky said its board terminated an April 28
agreement to merge with the New York investment firm Gibbons, Green
van Amerongen Ltd. for $2.35 billion in cash and stock.
   The three principals said they agreed to dismiss all pending
litigation involving the four-month takeover battle. Lucky said it
would pay Gibbons, Green a $20 million fee plus expenses for
breaking the pact.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lucky
closed unchanged at $64.37{ Friday while American Stores fell $1 to
$53.25.
   The offer from Salt Lake City-based American Stores is subject
to certain conditions, including the tender of at least a majority
of Lucky's 38.6 million outstanding shares. American Stores said it
has received written commitments from commercial banks for all
financing required.
   The American Stores offer expires at midnight EDT June 1.
   ``We are extremely pleased that an agreement has been reached,''
said American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs. ``American Stores has
always considered Lucky to be the leading supermarket chain in
California and is enthusiastic about the combination of our Alpha
Beta (grocery store) operations with those of Lucky.''
   Under the agreement, any Lucky shares not purchased by American
Stores in the tender offer will be converted into the right to
receive $65 in cash in a merger between Lucky and a subsidiary of
American.
   On Tuesday, American Stores had raised its bid for Lucky to $65
a share, following the earlier Gibbons, Green offer of a leveraged
buyout that would pay $61 a share in cash for about 92 percent of
Lucky's outstanding shares. Gibbons, Green would also have issued
preferred shares valued at $7 a share for the remaining shares.
   American Stores' second bid followed the disclosure of
confidential information by Lucky to American, under the
stipulation that American would either sweeten its offer or end its
hostile bid.
   American Stores initiated the bidding with a $45-a-share offer
that Lucky rejected in March. Lucky also turned down an American
Stores' proposal to increase the bid to $50 a share in a negotiated
acquisition. The company stated at the time that it considered both
offers inadequate.
   In 1986, Lucky underwent a series of restructuring moves
designed to thwart a takeover bid by New York investor Asher
Edelman.
