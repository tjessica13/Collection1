<HEAD>State Workers' Calls To Radio Station Knock Out Phone System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State employees trying to ``Stump the
Dummy'' or win ``Loot in the Boot'' were outfoxed when their bosses
blocked calls to radio station contests after learning the calls
had caused the government's phone system to crash.
   Over the past few days, state officials thought they had major
phone problems when the phone system went down for up to 20 minutes
three or four times a day.
   When they checked into the problem, they learned the phones
weren't working because so many state workers were clogging phone
lines by calling KLIK to play such games as ``Loot in the Boot,''
in which players guess how much money the country music station is
giving away.
   Officials on Friday had the phone company restrict state
employees' access to all Jefferson City radio station contest
lines. Workers using a state phone to call the stations now receive
a recorded message preventing them from getting through.
   Office of Administration Director John Pelzer said he did not
know how many of the 12,000 state employees who work in the capital
area were trying to get through to contest lines.
   ``The phone company said thousands and thousands of people _ and
not just state employees _ were calling. I don't know how many
employees would have to be on the phone at the same time to bring
it down, but this is the first time in the five years we've had
this system that it has been brought to its knees,'' Pelzer said.
   One enterprising employee devised a method using the ``flash''
and ``redial'' buttons on her phone to call KLIK's contest line on
eight different lines at once, Pelzer daid.
   ``We've always had a reasonable policy toward personal phone
calls,'' Pelzer said. ``If you need to call home to take care of a
problem, OK. If you're sitting around listening to the radio all
day waiting for the disc jockey to say, `I'll take the seventh
caller'' so you can win $1,000, that is not reasonable and I don't
think anybody could argue that it is.''

<HEAD>Ducklings Cross The Street, Fall Into Storm Sewer In A Row</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Why did the 18 ducks cross the busy
street?
   They were trying to get to the other side, but they didn't make
it. Seventeen fell into a storm sewer.
   Louie DeLuca said he was looking out the window of his
woodworking shop Friday when he saw a wood duck hen with 17
ducklings trailing behind cross the busy street in downtown
Papillion.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``They were certainly in the
wrong place.''
   DeLuca, 42, said he and his 12-year-old son, Danny, ran outside
and stood in the middle of the street ``directing and stopping
traffic'' so the ducks could pass.
   But the mother duck began to run when she spied DeLuca.
   ``She ran right over a sewer grate and naturally the little ones
followed,'' DeLuca said.
   And one by one, the baby ducks disappeared through the openings
in the grate. The mother continued to run and eventually flew off,
DeLuca said.
   ``My son and I got a box and, as each baby duck jumped out of
the sewer grate, we caught them and put them in the box.''
   The nimble brown-and-yellow ducklings were about the size of
tennis balls, DeLuca said. All but one jumped out of the sewer, he
said.
   ``The last one seemed kind of scared.''
   So the duck Samaritan called the Public Works Department and a
crew came out with a crane, lifted off the grate and pulled the
last duckling out.
   DeLuca said his son and daughter took the ducklings to the Henry
Doorly Zoo.
   ``The mother never returned,'' he said.

<HEAD>TV Station Replaces Morton Downey Jr. With `Love Boat'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loudmouthed talk show host Morton
Downey Jr. has been replaced by reruns of ``The Love Boat'' on a
television station that canceled his show after just four days
because it was too obscene, a spokesman says.
   Downey, who often gets into shouting matches with guests and
audience members, was pulled Thursday, four days after his debut on
WRGB-TV, station general manager David Lynch said.
   The language and material of the syndicated ``Morton Downey Jr.
Show'' were too obscene for ``the image of the station,'' Lynch
said.
   Employees of the CBS affiliate spent 30 to 40 hours trying to
edit the one-hour show to be suitable for viewing in its 9 a.m.
time slot, he said. The show starts at 9 p.m. on its home station
of WWOR-TV in New Jersey.
   Until further notice, WRGB will replace the show with reruns of
``The Love Boat,'' Lynch said.
   In his Philadelphia debut, Downey more than doubled the ratings
that ``Hill Street Blues'' had received in the same time slot,
WPHL-TV officials said.
   ``To tell you the truth we're not surprised,'' said Karen
Corbin, WPHL programming director. Downey is ``a phenomenon; there
was never any doubt in our minds that if Philadelphia viewers were
given a chance to watch Mort Downey, they'd rush to do it.''

<HEAD>Defense Secretary and Japanese discuss plans for jet fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and Japanese
officials have discussed Washington's plans to develop a jet
fighter known as the FSX, a Carlucci aide said Friday.
   He also said Carlucci is ``very pleaced'' with American-Japanese
defense cooperation including sharing the costs of maintaining U.S.
servicemen in Japan.
   The aide, a senior Defense Department official, spoke with the
condition he not be indentified.
   Carlucci held two days of talks with senior Japanese Defense and
Foreign Ministry officials and there were no areas of significant
disagreement, according to the official.
   Carlucci arrived in Tokyo Thursday to brief Japanese authorities
on the U.S.-Soviet summit conference in Moscow and discuss
bilateral issues.
   The aide said Carlucci and Japanese defense officials discussed
only in general terms the plans to jointly develop the FSX fighter.
   ``However this works out it will be in a positive way,'' he
said. ``It is a signpost for the future for both of us because an
essential part of our defense relationship will be the exchange of
technology, a two-way flow.''
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp., a public television network, said
the two sides agreed to set up a ``technology steering committee''
to oversee the transfer of FSX technology between the Japanese
Defense Agency and the U.S. Air Force.
   It said the $1.3 billion needed for developing the jet fighter
will come from Japanese firms, with U.S. companies as
subcontractors, and the United States will develop the plane's
engines and Japan its radar system.
   Carlucci's aide said both countries ``are constantly
addressing'' the issue of financial support for the more than
50,000 American military personnel stationed in the main Japanese
islands and Okinawa.
   Some U.S. congressmen have said Japan should do more because of
the enormous increase in the value of the yen, which has more than
doubled against the dollar in the last three years.
   ``We're not going around with a tin cup because we need help
with our budget problems,'' the aide said. ``You can't go around
poor-mouthing your friends _ they get tired of it.
   ``When you talk about burden-sharing, we should talk about
mutual security and joint cooperation, and identify areas of
weakness.''
   Japan provides more than $45,000 worth of support annually for
each U.S. serviceman stationed here, Assistant Defense Secretary
Richard L. Armitage told Congress March 17. It also helps pay some
expenses of the 21,000 Japanese working at U.S. bases.
   ``Altogether, Japan will spend $2.5 billion ... the most
generous host-nation support arrangement the U.S. enjoys anywhere
in the world,'' Armitage said.

<HEAD>Military Says It's Ill-Equipped And Ill-Trained For Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Pentagon official admits the military
faces a tough obstacle in the drug war _ itself.
   For starters, there are surveillance planes with cracked wings,
supersonic fighters that could fall from the sky while tailing
slow-moving drug planes, and military police whose training does
not include reading suspects their rights.
   Nonetheless, the Joint Chiefs of Staff are preparing battle
plans for an escalated anti-drug effort by the military, Marine Lt.
Gen. Stephen G. Olmstead told a House Government Operations
subcommittee on Friday.
   As deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug policy and
enforcement, Olmstead is responsible for coordinating the
military's anti-drug effort, which was ordered by Congress in
legislation authorizing Defense Department spending programs.
   Olmstead said that use of airborne warning planes is the only
immediate way to detect smuggler aircraft flying over the
U.S.-Mexican border.
   That's where the military's problems begin.
   Navy E2C surveillance planes, one of three types of detection
aircraft that could be used, are ``in bad trouble with cracked wing
problems,'' the general said. Thirty-four planes in the fleet of 85
are currently out of service, he testified.
   ``The Navy has a major rehabilitation problem,'' he added. ``I'm
not sure any would be available. We have just reduced the force by
a drastic number the past year.''
   The Coast Guard and Customs Service each have two E2C's on
anti-drug patrols, but they face the same wing problems and may be
grounded.
   Another solution is the Air Force AWACS, a much larger
surveillance plane.
   But Olmstead said that the Air Force has only 33 AWACS on active
missions, a third of them overseas. Of the 22 in the United States,
he said, the initial estimate is that five or six would be needed
each day to cover the U.S.-Mexican border.
   It costs $9,400 an hour to operate such a plane, Olmstead said,
adding that the AWACS and the carrier-based E2C are far too
sophisticated to be operated economically for anti-drug missions.
   Olmstead did acknowledge that the land-based Navy P-3
surveillance plane is a good option. The plane is used by the Coast
Guard and the Customs Service in anti-drug patrols.
   Committee Chairman Glenn English, D-Okla., then asked if the
military could provide combat aircraft _ such as the F-14, F-15,
F-16, F-18 and F-4 _ to intercept drug smugglers.
   Olmstead said using such planes to follow slow-moving drug
planes would cause them to stall and fall out of the sky.
   The general also said that military police are not trained to
perform civilian arrests. ``They're not concerned with civil rights
and Miranda (reading a defendant his rights when arrested).''
   And, Olmstead said, to have the military seal the borders
against air and sea smugglers, as some lawmakers are demanding, the
armed forces would have to ``stop everything else we're doing.'' He
estimated that just to seal the ground border with Mexico would
take between 20,000 and 40,000 troops.
   Olmstead was asked by Rep. Bill Grant, D-Fla., if the Navy would
have to cut back its military mission by increasing drug patrols.
   ``Yes, I suspect it would,'' the general said.

   Here is the transcript of President Reagan's
remarks upon return Friday from the Moscow summit and the
introduction by Vice President George Bush:
   BUSH: Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan, I'm delighted to say, on
behalf of the people of the United States of America, welcome home
and well done.
   Everyone in America watched your historic trip and hoped for the
best, and pulled for you. And now it's over and we can all say that
you've made a historic contribution to peace in the world.
   On arms control, (British Prime Minister) Mrs. (Margaret)
Thatcher probably put it best when she said that, ``You have
bravely gone forward, in spite of the voices of denial and doubt.
You showed the only way to succeed is by retaining your resolve and
speaking with conviction.''
   As for the latter, I suspect you know, Mr. President, that you
caught a little flack for bringing up the issue of human rights so
forcefully, right there in the heart of the Soviet system. But most
Americans _ most Americans felt, as I did, we have a tradition of
freedom and a history of free speech, and what's wrong with telling
the other guy how you feel?
   The fact is, you made us proud. This week, an American president
strode the hard ground of Red Square, and reminded the world,
through the sureness of his step and the lilt of his words, what a
bracing thing freedom is _ what a moving and bracing thing.
   So welcome back, Mr. President. It's good to see you. God bless
you and Nancy.
   REAGAN: Thank you. Thank you. Well, thank you all very much. As
some of you may have heard, (Soviet leader) Mr. (Mikhail S.)
Gorbachev and I have been trading Russian proverbs this week. But,
you know, flying back across the Atlantic today, it was an American
saying that kept running through my mind. Believe me, as far as
Nancy and I are concerned, ``There's no place like home.''
   We want to thank all of you for coming out today. We're grateful
for your enthusiasm and for the warmth of your welcome. And take it
from me, all this red, white and blue scenery hits these two weary
travelers right where we live. If I might paraphrase George M.
Cohan, some may call it flag waving, but right now I can't think of
a better flag to wave.
   We're a little tired, but we're exhilarated at what has
happened, exhilarated, too, at the thought of the future and what
may lie ahead for the young people of America and all of the world.
   The events of this week in Moscow were momentous _ not
conclusive, perhaps, but momentous. And believe me, right now,
momentous will do just fine.
   You know, it's occurred to me that time does have a way of
sorting things out. For many years now, Americans have seen the
danger of war and pleaded the cause of peace. And other Americans
have seen the danger of totalitarianism and pleaded the cause of
freedom. So I was just thinking, why don't we just agree today on
something that maybe we should have been saying to each other all
along: that we're all Americans, and that we all have one and the
same burning cause in our hearts, the cause of world peace and the
cause of world freedom.
   Peace and freedom are what this trip was about, and we saw some
real progress in several areas in Moscow _ on human rights, on
regional conflicts, on greater contacts between the people of the
Soviet Union and the United States. We exchanged the documents that
put into force an historic treaty that eliminates for the first
time an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons, and
establishes real breakthroughs in verification procedures. And we
made tangible progress toward an even more historic treaty on
strategic weapons. Yes, a 50 percent reduction in nuclear weapons.

   All of this was good and promising for the future.
   But there's something else I want to tell you about. I wish you
could have seen the faces we saw in the Soviet Union. As I said to
the young people at Moscow State University, it was hard really to
tell them apart from any other group of students, in our country or
anywhere else in the world. And as I told Mr. Gorbachev, there were
also the faces, young and old, we saw on the streets of Moscow. At
first, more than anything else, they were curious faces. But as
time went on, the smiles began, and then the waves. And I don't
have to tell you, Nancy and I smiled back and waved just as hard.
   The truth came home to us once again. It isn't people, but
governments, that make war. And it isn't people, but governments,
that erect barriers that keep us apart. Much is happening in the
Soviet Union. We hope and pray that the signs of change continue
there. Our pledge, Mr. Gorbachev and I, is to work to continue
building a better understanding between our two countries.
   But let's remember, too, that just as our forward strategy of
peace and freedom anticipated positive changes, it remains ready to
take us over any bumps in the road. And that's because our strategy
is based on faith in the eventual triumph of human freedom. That
faith in human, that abiding belief in what the unfettered human
spirit can accomplish, defines us as a people and a nation.
   And you know, I've been told that even a few veteran journalists
said a chill went through them this week at a sight they never
thought they would see in their lifetime: An American president,
there in the heart of Moscow, talking about economic, political and
individual freedoms to the future leaders of the Soviet Union,
explaining that freedom makes a difference and explaining how
freedom works. Talking too, about the possibility of a new age of
prosperity and peace, where old antagonisms between nations can
someday be put behind us, a new age that could be ours, if only
we'll reach out to it.
   Ladies and gentlemen, all across our country, during these weeks
of spring, it's graduation time. And I hope our young graduates
know what a sudden, startling future may now be before them, a
future brought about by a technological and information revolution
based on a growing understanding of the nexus between economic
growth and creative freedom. But I hope too, that young Americans,
and all Americans, will always remember that this revolution is
only the continuation of a revolution begun two centuries ago, a
revolution of hope, a hope that someday a new land might become a
place where freedom's light would beacon forth.
   That faith in freedom, that belief in the unalienable rights of
man, begun in Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia, traveled last week
to the Lenin hills in Moscow. It was the selflessness of so many
Americans that brought it there, selflessness by Americans for over
two centuries, but especially by those Americans who fought what
has truly been called the twilight struggle of the postwar years.
(It was) a struggle where national interest was not always clearly
defined or adversaries easily identified, or sacrifice fully
appreciated.
   Now, more than ever, we must continue. The judgment of future
generations will be harsh upon us if, after so much sacrifice, and
now at the hour of hope, we falter or fail. Let us resolve to
continue, one nation, one people united in our love of peace and
freedom; determined to keep our defenses strong, to stand with
those who struggle for freedom across the world, to keep America a
shining city, a light unto the nations.
   And let us remember, too, that there's work remaining here at
home, that whatever the accomplishments of America we must never be
prideful toward others. We have much to learn from peoples of
foreign lands and other cultures. Nor should we ever grow content.
   Let us never rest until every American of every race or
background knows the full blessing of liberty, until ``justice for
all'' is truly justice for all.
   And most of all, let us remember that being an American means
remembering another loyalty, a loyalty, as the hymn puts it, ``to
another country I have heard of, a place whose King is never seen
and whose armies cannot be counted.''
   And yet if patriotism is not the only thing, it is one of the
best things. And we can be grateful to God that we have seen such a
rebirth of it here in this country.
   And you know, it's true frequently when such moments happen in a
nation's history, there's a popular saying or song that speaks for
that time. And just maybe this verse sounds familiar to you: ``If
tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life, and I
had to start again with just my children and my wife, I'd thank my
lucky stars to be living here today 'cause the flag still stands
for freedom and they can't take that away.''
   Nancy and I have full hearts today. We're grateful to all of you
and to the American people, Grateful for the chance to serve,
grateful for all of the support and warmth that you've given us
over the years.
   And do you know what else? We think our friend Lee Greenwood has
it just right: ``All our days and especially today, there ain't no
doubt we love this land. God bless the USA.''

<HEAD>Cargo Rocket To Be Launched From Wing Of B-52</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A small Virginia aerospace firm says it has
signed a Pentagon contract to launch an unspecified cargo next year
with a new rocket strapped under the wing of a bomber until
released and fired.
   Orbital Sciences Corp. said Friday the first launch of its
Pegasus rocket is scheduled for mid-1989. The customer is the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   David W. Thompson, president and chief executive officer, said
the firm expects to launch satellites of up to 600 pounds for less
than $10 million each, a fraction of the cost of vehicles launched
conventionally from the ground.
   OSC's partner in the venture is Hercules Aerospace Co., an
old-line rocket maker that had a part in the Polaris, Trident,
Pershing, Peacekeeper (MX), Poseidon and Minuteman missiles.
   Thompson said no government money was spent to develop the new
rocket. He said the company expects to build, sell and launch a
payload a month with the rocket.
   The company will launch the Pegasus from a 36-year-old Air Force
B-52 bomber _ the same one that carried the X-15 on its first
flight in 1962. The rocket will be strapped under the ship's right
wing and released over the ocean at 40,000 feet.
   ``It has twice the payload capability of a comparable
ground-launched vehicle,'' Thompson said.
   The winged, three-stage, solid-fuel Pegasus is 50 feet long and
50 inches in diameter _ about the size of the X-15, the first
aircraft to reach the fringes of space.

<HEAD>Bill Would Mandate Random Testing of Railroad Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sponsor of a bill that would require
railroads to randomly test their employees for drug and alcohol
abuse says he believes the measure protects workers against
erroneous readings and harassment.
   But Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, who introduced the legislation
Friday, said at a news conference that even if railroad unions
decide not to support the bill, ``We'll continue to forge ahead.''
   Congress has been focusing on drug and alcohol abuse by
transportation workers ever since the Jan. 4, 1987, collision
between an Amtrak passenger train and linked Conrail locomotives in
Chase, Md. Sixteen people were killed and 175 hurt in the accident,
in which Conrail crewmen have admitted they were smoking marijuana
shortly before the wreck.
   But bills that would require random drug testing have been
bogged down, with labor and other opponents arguing that such
procedures violate the right of privacy and leave employees
vulnerable to harassment and incorrect test results that could
threaten their careers.
   Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce transportation
subcommittee, has been among those arguing that laboratory tests
are so unreliable that large numbers of workers should not be
subjected to tests.
   He pointed Friday, however, to evidence of accidents caused by
drug and alcohol abuse and said, ``We do have a great demand for
this kind of thing.''
   On April 25, Dr. Roger Horn of Hunt Valley, Md., whose daughter
Ceres, 16, was killed in the Chase accident, visited television and
radio stations and newspapers in Luken's Cincinnati district and
argued that a random testing bill was needed. Horn is a member of
Safe Travel America, a group of relatives and friends of the
crash's victims who have lobbied for such legislation on Capitol
Hill.
   Many railroad union officials have also dropped their outright
opposition to random testing and now say they are willing to try to
help craft Luken's legislation.
   Lawrence L. Mann, attorney for the Railway Labor Executives'
Association, which represents rail unions, said labor officials
like the protections Luken put in his bill, but are still concerned
that the testing would be an invasion of privacy.
   ``We're not going to push this bill,'' he said after Luken's
news conference. ``We're going to try to improve it.''
   The legislation would give the Department of Transportation 90
days to set up procedures for administering the tests.
   Workers testing positive would be suspended and required to
undergo rehabilitation programs. They would be given their jobs
back after successfully completing the treatment.
   The bill establishes a series of requirements designed to
protect workers against inaccurate test results and to protect them
from harassment. It also sets penalties for falsifying results and
avoiding testing by leaving accident scenes.
   ``This strikes a fair balance between protecting the public from
the lethal threat of drug use by railroad personnel and affording
the drug abuser human treatment that allows him a real opportunity
to put his life in order again,'' said the subcommittee's ranking
Republican, Rep. Bob Whittaker of Kansas, who appeared with Luken.
   The measure would also require testing after accidents, before
hiring, for reasonable cause and as part of annual physical
examinations.
   On May 5, the Federal Railroad Administration proposed rules
that would require railroads to randomly test many of their
employees for drugs, but not alcohol. The government already
requires drug and alcohol testing for employees involved in
accidents, but the constitutionality of those rules has been
challenged in federal court.

   An FBI report says guidelines the bureau used
to conduct a two-year investigation of a group opposed to
administration policies in Central America were too vague and
should be tightened, say government sources familiar with the
report.
   An FBI spokesman, however, said it would be premature to say
whether the bureau planned to change procedures as a result of the
inquiry into how it investigated the Committee in Solidarity with
the People of El Salvador.
   The investigation came to light after a New York lawyers' group
obtained documents in February showing that FBI agents photographed
protesters at peace rallies, recorded license plate numbers and
investigated nuns, union members and college students.
   The internal FBI review was launched in February amid
allegations by CISPES that the investigation had been politically
motivated and had violated civil liberties.
   The investigation, conducted from 1983 to 1985 and involving
nearly all the FBI's field offices, was conducted under the
bureau's anti-terrorism guidelines.
   The tenor of one of the recommendations in the FBI report was
that ``the guidelines need to be made more specific to keep us out
of trouble,'' one source said Friday.
   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich said FBI Director William Sessions
and his senior staff are reviewing the report, will promptly
provide detailed information to congressional oversight committees
and that it is ``premature'' to say whether the bureau will change
any procedures.
   The report is highly critical of how the FBI handled informer
Frank Varelli, whose information supplied much of the basis for the
bureau's investigation of CISPES.
   The internal report said there was a lack of proper supervision
of Varelli and that he received certain information from FBI files
that he should not have gotten, according to the sources.
   The investigation of CISPES began March 30, 1983, prompted by
tips that key members were involved in covertly furnishing funds
and material to the FMLN, a leftist group seeking to seize power in
El Salvador.
   It was closed in June 1985 when the Justice Department concluded
the group was involved in political activities protected by the
First Amendment and not in international terrorism.
   Varelli, a former evangelist from El Salvador, became a paid
informer for the FBI's Dallas office in 1981, the same year the
bureau began a probe of CISPES for possible violation of the
Foreign Agents Registration Act.
   That probe was closed after 18 months, but the FBI opened the
1983 probe under much broader authority granted by Justice
Department guidelines governing inquiries into international
terrorism.
   Many provisions of those guidelines are secret, but in general
terms they allow inquiries into groups and individuals who could
possibly represent a terrorist threat to the United States or aid
and abet others who would undertake violent terrorist activities.

<DATELINE>HUDSON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anesthesiologist says he is quitting his
practice to run a self-service laundry and dry-cleaning business
because the wash carries a lot less liability than medicine.
   ``When doctors have a malpractice suit, it's a $3 million to $5
million loss. If someone's laundry doesn't come out right, I just
pay them the $40 or so to cover it and it's done,'' said Dr. Joseph
J. Merigo.
   Merigo, 57, took over the Hudson Coin-Op on March 1. He said
insurance rates drove him out of his 20-year practice as an
anesthesiologist at Boston-area hospitals.
   ``A lot of people think you make a lot of money as a doctor,''
Merigo said. ``But you don't have any choice, your bills are so
high.''
   Merigo said his liability insurance premiums just about equal
his annual income, although he has never been sued.
   Merigo still works three mornings a week at Bournewood Hospital,
a psychiatric facility in Brookline, whose electroconvulsive
therapy center he helped found. He will stop practicing medicine
Oct. 23, when his insurance policy runs out.
   He admitted to some hesitation about the career switch. ``You
don't get the same kick from doing a suit that you do after doing a
good job in a life-threatening situation,'' Merigo said.
   And he has found that old habits die hard. He recently tended to
a customer who turned gray while dragging a bag of clothes into the
store.
   ``I asked her if she had problems with her heart and if she was
taking medicine. She said she was. I made her sit down and catch
her breath,'' Merigo said.
   ``That woman was in congestive heart failure right here in that
chair,'' he said, pointing to a seat near the cash register.
   But the laundry business has its rewards, he said. ``I figure if
I can buy another one of these, I'll be making about what I was
making as a doctor.''

<TEXT>
   Five more bodies were found Friday in a
mound of debris in the Sikhs' bullet-scarred Golden Temple in
Punjab state, the Press Trust of India reported.
   That increased the number of bodies of hostages recovered from
the temple complex to 21, the news agency said.
   Militant Sikhs who surrendered after troops assaulted the temple
in Amritsar last month said the Sikh separatists had held at least
40 people as hostages in the complex before the army siege began.
Based on that report soldiers are still searching for the bodies of
19 other victims.
   United News of India said the militants extorted money from the
captives' families on the false promise that they would be freed.
   It said among the victims were four women, and it was believed
the hostages had been tortured before they were killed in the
temple complex in Amritsar, 260 miles northwest of New Delhi. The
temple is the Sikhs' holiest shrine.
   More than 200 Sikh militants surrendered after the 10-day siege
of the temple ended on May 18. During the siege, 41 Sikh fighters
were killed along with five civilians caught in the crossfire,
according to authorities.
   They said the hostages were killed by the militants before and
during the siege.
   Sikh activists have been blamed for killing more than 1,240
people in northern Punjab state this year in their batle for an
independent homeland.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's population of 800 million people
but are in a majority in Punjab. The separatists launched their war
in 1982, claiming discrimination by Hindus who comprise 80 percent
of the population.

   Leonard, a 7-foot-long boa constrictor who
disappeared from his job as a night watchman at a car lot,
mysteriously returned three days later, his owner says.
   ``We don't know how he got here or where he came from, but we're
happy he's back,'' said Reggie Roberts. ``We're going to have to
tighten our security. We're going to get two guard snakes, one to
watch the other.''
   Leonard was reported missing Monday from T.R. Roberts Motors,
where it was kept in a glass showcase during business hours. At
night, the snake was freed to roam the locked office as a ``guard
snake.''
   ``Beware! Guard Snake on Duty,'' reads a sign on the office door.
   Leonard went off duty Monday, apparently after a vandal broke a
window. Roberts believes either the vandal stole the snake or the
reptile escaped through the window.
   Roberts posted a $100 reward _ no questions asked _ for
Leonard's safe return, and The Gadsden Times ran a front-page story
on the snake's disappearance.
   The snake mysteriously reappeared Thursday afternoon at the door
to Roberts' office, perhaps because he was hungry and missed his
old job, Roberts said.
   ``We're just tickled to have him back,'' he said.

   Leonard Gooding's remodeling project
turned into a major restoration effort when he removed some siding
and discovered his old house was actually a log cabin.
   ``I was going to tear the siding off it and rent it out,''
Gooding said Friday in a telephone interview. ``I eliminated all
the siding and came up with a log cabin. It's in perfect shape.''
   The 50-foot-long, 30-foot-long building is constructed of round,
hand-hewn white oak logs. It has no plumbing, but is wired for
electricity.
   Gooding bought the house from his nephew, Milton Gooding, who
owned it for 10 years and lived in a newer, concrete-block addition
to the rear of the house. The part built of logs was used as a
day-care center.
   Before Milton Gooding bought it, the structure was used as a
church for dozens of years, Leonard Gooding said.
   ``We know it goes back at least until 1939, but I think that
date applies only to the new part, not the logs,'' he said.
   Gooding is considering what to do instead of adding the building
to his list of rental properties.
   ``I'm already getting some interest and some offers on it,'' he
said. ``I think it would make a nice antique store, or lake home or
even a restaurant. I may sell it to someone who wants to move it.''

   A car jumped a curb and ran into a large group of
children walking home from a middle school Friday, killing one and
injuring several others, police and witnesses said.
   The students were walking home from nearby Rosa Parks Middle
School when the car went up on the sidewalk and lawn, striking the
children about 2:30 p.m.
   Ernest Powell, 14, of Detroit died shortly after arriving at St.
John Hospital, hospital spokeswoman Dorothy Colombo said.
   The driver of the car, Johnnie Person, 66, of Detroit was
arrested, and was scheduled to be arraigned Saturday, but no
charges were filed as of Friday night, Officer Eric Gensley said.
   Three youngsters were hospitalized in fair condition with arm,
leg and head injuries. They were identified as Jamel Thompson, 12;
Dwayne Greer, 11; and Derrick Davenport, 12, all of Detroit,
Colombo said.
   Rose Robertson, a nurse at Henry Ford Hospital who was aiding
injured students at the scene, said she heard the driver tell
police that children threw a bottle at his car.
   She said other students were injured but chose to go home
instead of the hospital.
   ``The scene was chaotic. There were injured students laying on
the grass and there were adults and children trying to help,''
Detroit police Sgt. Martin Joseph said from the scene.
   Joseph said the driver did not appear intoxicated or high on
drugs.
   ``I didn't smell alcohol and the guy was walking OK,'' Joseph
said.
   After the late model Cadillac hit the students, it struck a
parked car and came to rest by a fire hydrant, Joseph said.
   Ken Smith said he was picking up his son at Rosa Parks Middle
School when he saw the accident at 2:30 p.m.
   ``One of the kids bounced a basketball out in the street,''
Smith said. ``An old black Cadillac _ I don't know what speed he
was going _ he hit the ball and went out of control and crashed
into a crowd.''
   Principal Raymond Demeulemeester said he was following the
children home when the accident happened ahead of him.
   ``There were children on the ground and some were screaming and
some were trying to help,'' Demeulemeester said.
   The principal said police arrived at the scene about three
minutes after the accident occurred.

   About $1.4 million in old postage
stamps destined for collectors in Britain has disappeared from an
airport warehouse in Liberia, the government said.
   The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications confirmed Friday
that the stamps were missing after two daily newspapers broke the
story.
   The Daily Observer, one of the newspapers, reported that the
Liberian stamps had been stored at the warehouse and were to be
shipped to London to be sold to collectors.
   The government was taking the old stamps out of circulation and
replacing them with commemoratives. It had hoped to earn some hard
currency by selling the old stamps to British collectors.

   Police in riot gear arrested at least 11
people Friday night when protesters in a ``bash the rich''
demonstration threw rocks and smoke bombs at passing cars. No

   About 200 people, many calling themselves anarchists,
demonstrated in the city's Uptown area to call for an end of
wealth, pornography and corporate exploitation. Organizers called
the action a ``bash the rich'' protest.
   ``There's a small group of anarchists, about 30 to 35, that
marched down Lake Street throwing rocks at cars, damaging property
... and they're going to jail for it,'' said Deputy Police Chief
Bob Lutz.
   Two of the 11 arrested were juveniles, said police commander
Sherman Otto, and all but one face misdemeanor disturbing-the-peace
charges. One was arrested on an assault charge after hitting an
undercover officer with a protest sign, Otto said.
   One car was damaged by a rock, but no other property damage was
reported, Otto said.
   A group known as the Revolutionary Anarchist Bowling League was
blamed by police for inciting vandalism at protests earlier this
spring against U.S. military involvement in Central America.

<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old Japanese schoolboy,
kidnapped one week ago, has been found alive in a Taipei alley, his
eyes covered by tape and his head wrapped in a white cloth, police
said today.
   Police today launched a massive manhunt for the boy's kidnappers
who reportedly received $63,000 to free the youth.
   Police found Tetsuyoshi Ohta after the kidnappers informed his
parents of the boy's location, Taipei Police Chief Liao Chao-hsiang
told reporters.
   The boy had been missing since May 27 when he was abducted while
walking to a calligraphy lesson in suburban Taipei, according to
police.
   Newspapers, without naming sources, said the boy's mother
delivered a ransom of $63,000 to a hotel in Kaohsiung, 216 miles
south of Taipei, on Thursday. The newspapers gave no further
details and the mother refused to comment on the reports.
   Newspapers reported that Tetsuyoshi, in a white T-shirt and blue
jean shorts, looked startled when found by the police and said: ``I
am hungry. I want to go home.''
   Tetsuyoshi told reporters at the police station he was
blindfolded during the entire ordeal and was taken to several
places. He said he was not beaten.
   The boys' parents met him at the police station and were
escorted home by the police, the reports said.
   Police chief Liao said authorities were combing the island for
the two men and one woman whom the boy said were his kidnappers.
Liao said Tetsuyoshi was too frightened to give descriptions of the
three.
   Kidnappers, if convicted, can receive the death penalty in
Taiwan.
   According to police accounts, a man called the boy's parents on
the evening of the kidnapping and demanded $63,000 for the boy's
return.
   The next afternoon the boy's mother gave the money to taxi
driver Yeh Shao-ming, who honked his horn three times outside a
fast food restaurant in downtown Taipei, a signal specified in the
ransom demand.
   About 100 plainclothes police arrested Yeh on the spot and
retrieved the money. They were unable to find the boy, who police
believed was in a white sedan not far from where Yeh was waiting.
   Police said the taxi driver claimed he knew nothing of the
kidnapping and was paid by a woman to run the errand.
   In an open letter to a leading newspaper that appeared Monday,
the Ohtas pleaded for the release of their child.
   ``Please don't hurt our son and understand how we feel as
parents,'' the handwritten letter in the Chinese-language United
Daily News said. ``Release the child as soon as possible.''
   On Thursday night, news reports said, the boy's mother delivered
the ransom.

   A severe drought in Northern Mexico is
killing cattle by the thousands, turning cropland into brittle
cakes of scorched soil and threatening to destroy farm workers'
livelihood.
   ``We're looking at a very ugly situation,'' said Teofilo
Anchondo, a farmer and cattle producer on a communal farm just
outside this Chihuahua state capital.
   ``Our animals are very skinny and a lot have died,'' said
Anchondo, who has lost eight of his 50 cows to the drought in
recent weeks.
   The semi-arid north averages only 10 to 12 inches of rainfall a
year and estimates on the current season average about half that,
although some ranchers say the situation is even worse.
   Miniscule rainfall last fall in the north-central and
northwestern states and lack of rain and snow in the Sierra Madre
Occidental during the winter has left thousands of acres of
pastureland barren, nonirrigated fields blistered, dams and wells
low.
   The rich agricultural and grazing lands of northwestern Sonora
and Sinaloa states are also drying up due to the almost yearlong
drought there.
   And Sonora Gov. Rodolfo Felix Valdez announced this week the
suspension of the fall planting season _ due to lack of water in
the Ruiz Cortines reservoir _ and an emergency employment plan to
put farm laborers to work repairing roads and canals and clearing
land.
   ``Northwestern Mexico is weathering one of its worst droughts in
20 years,'' said Hector Cordova, Agriculture Department spokesman
in Mexico City.
   The drought also has hit some parts of central and southern
Mexico.
   Barren pastures in the sprawling states of Sonora, Chihuahua and
Coahuila on the U.S. border are forcing beef producers to buy
thousands of tons of alfalfa and other feed to sustain cattle that
usually would be put out to graze.
   Milk producers who buy feed even in normal years are finding the
cost skyrocketing each week as competition for the scarce alfalfa
heats up.
   May, usually a good month for rain in eastern Chihuahua and
western Coahuila, didn't bring a drop this year.
   ``It hasn't rained since October. I'm very worried,'' said
Anchondo.
   In Chihuahua and Coahuila states, farmers who work nonirrigated
land are foregoing the current corn-planting season in the hope
that June brings rain _ and favorable bean-planting conditions.
   In Nuevo Leon on the northeastern border with the United States,
cattle are dying in unsuccessful attempts to jump ditches in search
of water and fields are dried out.
   Residents report drinking water supplies are precariously low in
some poorer areas, but the drought has not reached a critical stage
in homes.
   Several thousand cows have across the north died because grass
remaining in the pastures lacks vitamins and proteins, the cattle
are walking too far for water or they're eating toxic herbs,
ranchers said.
   Scores of calves are born dead or die shortly after birth
because their mothers are in such poor shape, the ranchers said.
   ``We're getting cattle that can't even stand up,'' said Alonso
Baeza, general manager of a Chihuahua meat-packing plant.
   Baeza said the plant slaughters 150 to 200 head a day under
normal circumstances.
   ``Now 80 head is a good day and only about half of them are in
good shape,'' he said.
   ``The small farmer is suffering the most because he doesn't have
the resources to buy feed,'' Baeza said.
   Although Sonora alone has lost more than 2,000 insured head of
cattle, total cattle losses throughout the north cannot be
calculated because most ranchers don't take out insurance, and
therefore do not report deaths.
   Likewise, it's impossible to estimate the degree of the economic
disaster now looming in the north, especially for the small farmer
who lives a hand-to-mouth existance even in the best of times.
   ``There's no bank but our own pocketbooks and we're using up all
our savings,'' said Alejandro Villalobos, 35, a Chihuahua farmer
and cattle rancher.
   Said Villalobos: ``You go along and when it's time to sell
cattle you owe almost as much as you get.''

   Spring, who was selected to be an astronaut in May 1980, was a
mission specialist on the space shuttle Atlantis flight that
launched in November 1985.
   During that mission, Spring helped deploy three communication
satellites, and went on two spacewalks that totaled 12 hours.
   Spring logged 165 hours in space on that mission. Since then, he
has been doing general technical support work for the space station
project.

   A physics professor honored for his
breakthrough in the field of superconductivity says he will leave
the University of Alabama to join the faculty of Columbia
University.
   Maw-Kuen Wu will join Nobel laureate T.D. Lee at the New York
City school.
   ``This was sort of a long dream,'' Wu said Friday. ``As a child,
he was one of my heroes, when I decided to be a scientist at a very
young age.''
   Wu last year led research that raised the temperature of
superconducting materials. The discovery improved the prospects for
taking superconductivity from laboratory experiments to practical
applications.
   After the discovery, scientists talked about transmitting
electricity over long distances without losses, magnetically
levitated bullet trains, faster computers and small but powerful
medical scanners.
   In January, Wu and a colleague on the project were awarded the
National Academy of Sciences' Cyrus B. Comstock Prize, presented
every five years for the most important discovery or investigation
in electricity, magnetism or radiant energy.

   Mother Teresa arrived in preparation for her visit
to three state prisons amid reports that the prison pen pal who
invited her to Massachusetts is a sex offender.
   The 77-year-old Yugoslavian-born nun was greeted at the airport
Friday by four members of the Missionaries of Charity shelter in
Mission Hill.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn greeted Mother Teresa at the shelter when

   During a news conference at Walpole Thursday, inmate Donald
Ouimet said he was serving his second sentence in prison for
assault and battery and that he was once a Franciscan monk.
   The Patriot Ledger of Quincy reported Friday that Ouimet is
serving an 18- to 20-year year sentence for luring minors to his
West Springfield home and sexually assaulting them.

   The 4,500-member Screen Extras Guild
has approved a three-year contract with the producers of TV
commercials, a spokesman announced Friday.
   Members voted 1,633 to 81 to accept the contract, said Paul
Antico, a member of the SEG board of directors.
   In March SEG members staged a four-week walkout against
producers of television commercials, advertising agencies and
advertisers who wanted to cut the actors' $232.37 daily rate in
half, Antico said.
   The new contract preserves the daily rate and also provides a
slight raise for hand models and a wardrobe allowance for other
actors. The union did accept language that will slightly cut the
number of guild members that producers are required to hire on a
given project, Antico said.

<HEAD>European Blast at Wheat Decision `Disappoints' Lyng</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European complaints about the decision to
increase U.S. wheat production have been disappointing and at
variance with the facts, says Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   ``I was terribly disappointed in your response to our decision
to lower the set aside requirements for wheat producers,'' Lyng
said Friday in a letter to European Community Agriculture
Commissioner Frans Andriessen.
   He took issue with a statement by EC officials in Brussels on
Wednesday that the U.S. decision to reduce the acreage idling
requirement for wheat growers from 27.5 percent of planted acreage
to 10 percent would result in an additional 10 million to 12
million tons of grain on the world market.
   ``The prospects are really quite different,'' he said.
   Lyng expressed hope ``that in the future we can respond to each
other's policy announcements with a greater regard for the facts of
the case.''
   He also complained in the letter that European wheat production
``continues at high levels despite repeated assurances that
production will be lowered.''
   In a strongly worded statement, the European commissioners
declared that the United States was violating international trade
agreements by increasing farm subsidies to American wheat producers.
   Farmers are required to idle the acreage specified by the
Agriculture Department if they are to be eligible for government
programs that include price support loans and income support
payments.
   ``U.S. wheat supplies available for export will be smaller''
than previously, even with less acreage idled, Lyng said. He
attributed this to lower stocks of wheat at the outset of the
marketing year.
   ``Smaller carry-in stocks will mean U.S. wheat supplies will
total about 90 million metric tons, nearly 3 million tons less than
a year earlier,'' he said. An attached chart showed overall
supplies at 109.4 million for 1986-87, 107.3 million for 1987-88,
93 million for 1988-89 and 90.4 million for 1989-90.
   He also said that because of participation by farmers in two
other acreage idling programs, ``the U.S. will continue to idle a
large amount of wheat land in 1989, about the equivalent to the
harvested wheat area of France, Spain and Portugal.''
   Lyng said the U.S. share of the world wheat trade was likely to
decrease even with the increased acreage to 40 percent or less,
compared with 42 percent last year and more than 45 percent in the
1970s.
   He said higher prices for wheat in the United States combined
with a 6.4 percent reduction in target prices ``will lower the
amount of subsidies paid to wheat farmers and increase their degree
of market orientation.''
   Target prices are set by Congress and adjusted by the
Agriculture Department to help determine the size of income support
payments made under some of the farm programs.

   Bigger supplies of some kinds of livestock and
poultry are leading to lower prices and driving down the return to
farmers on the food they produce, Agriculture Department economists
say.
   But moderate food price inflation overall is expected this year,
according to an economic analysis from USDA.
   The gap between consumer spending on food and the amount of
money farmers actually get out of it most likely will rise 6.6
percent this year to a total of $302 billion, according to the
analysis.
   Spending for domestically produced food is expected to rise 4eside
livestock and poultry supplies are
causing the change. A 50-cent cut in the milk support price is
expected to result in somewhat lower return to the dairy farmer
despite a slight increase in consumption.
   Fruit and vegetable prices are actually expected to be lower
amid expanded supplies of lettuce, potatoes, apples, pears and
strawberries.
   But stronger export demand for grains and oil crops as well as
reduced supplies of them should drive up prices somewhat and at
least partially offset a portion of the decline in farm value.
   Consumer food spending is expected to increase at about the same
rate as last year. Increased supplies of pork, poultry and some
other major commodities are expected to lower retail prices, but
the analysis foresees moderate food price inflation overall.

<HEAD>Doctors Try To Decide On Treatment For Duarte's Cancer</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be topped if developments warrant; no statement expected
from hospital before Monday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte
began his fourth day in a Washington hospital today, where doctors
are trying to decide how best to treat his liver and stomach cancer.
   Walter Reed Medical Army Medical Center issued a statement
Friday saying doctors at the hospital and Duarte's personal
physician would look at test results and ``present treatment
alternatives to the president and his family.''
   The hospital did not specify when a decision would be made. It
said Duarte was in guarded but stable condition.
   Both the hospital and Duarte's personal physician, Benjamin
Interiano, who is from El Salvador, have been reluctant to discuss
chances of Duarte's recovery. But a State Department official,
insisting on anonymity, told The Associated Press on Friday that
Duarte is suffering from terminal cancer.
   ``The only question is how long he will live. It's probably
measured in months,'' the official said.
   The official added there have been informal discussions in El
Salvador about the possibility of Duarte resigning his office. The
next in line in the order of succession is Vice President Rodolfo
Castillo Claramount, who is serving as acting president in Duarte's
absence.
   Duarte received a get-well visit from Vice President George Bush.
   Bush met with Duarte for 30 minutes in the Salvadoran
president's room at Walter Reed. During the visit, Bush ``wished
Duarte well and expressed his gratitude for what he's done for
democracy,'' Kristin Taylor, a spokeswoman for the vice president,
said.
   Duarte, 62, has been undergoing tests since his arrival at
Walter Reed on Tuesday night. He visited a special clinic Thursday
for magnetic resonance imaging tests to determine the extent of his
cancer.
   Duarte, who was born Nov. 23, 1925, in San Salvador, received a
civil engineering degree in 1948 from the University of Notre Dame
in South Bend, Ind.
   In 1960, he co-founded the Christian Democratic Party in El
Salvador and four years later was elected to the first of three
terms as mayor of San Salvador.
   He was expelled from the country by the military in 1972 while
running for president. He returned from exile in 1979 following a
coup by reformist-minded military officers. The next year he was
named a member of a military-civilian junta. He became president of
a new junta in December 1980.
   He won a five-year term in a presidential election in 1984 and
was hailed as a leader who could extricate his country from decades
of poverty and conflict.
   But an eight-year-old civil war with leftist forces continues
unabated, and the Central American nation's economy is in a
shambles. Duarte's party suffered a major defeat in municipal and
legislative elections in March.
   The Salvadoran constitution prohibits Duarte from running for
election again next March, and the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance appears to be in good position to win the presidency.

<HEAD>CIA Says Producing Documents Would Disclose Sources, Methods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The CIA says Oliver L. North and three
Iran-Contra co-defendants should not be shown spy agency documents
they requested, because they include information known only to the
president and a handful of other officials.
   Even at the CIA, only the director of the agency and his deputy
have knowledge of all the secret programs in the requested
documents, CIA General Counsel Russell J. Bruemmer said Friday.
   In a declaration filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell, Bruemmer said, ``Even the existence of certain of the
information ... cannot even be confirmed or acknowledged ...
without causing extreme damage to the national security of the
United States.''
   Bruemmer said CIA officials cannot recall a request in any
previous court case that sought a greater compilation of sensitive
information.
   ``To my knowledge, very few persons in the United States
Government other than the president hold the security clearances
necessary to review all the documents'' sought by the defense, he
told the court.
   The counsel said the information would reveal sources and
methods used by the United States to acquire intelligence and
conduct covert operations.
   The people providing information to the CIA, the technical
collection methods, and cooperative arrangements with foreign
intelligence services cannot be compromised without gravely
damaging the nation, the statement said.
   Seeking the documents were North, a former National Security
Council staff member; former National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter; and two businessmen, retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord, and Albert Hakim.
   They are charged, in part, with conspiring to use the profits
from presidentially authorized arms sales to Iran to aid the
Nicaraguan Contras when such assistance was banned by law.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Says It Captured Two Honduran Spies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua said it captured two
Honduran soldiers inside Nicaraguan territory and accused them of
spying in the latest incident of tension between the two countries.
   A Defense Ministry statement said two Honduran army troops
carrying M-16 rifles were caught near the town of Teotecacinte in
northern Nuevo Segovia province, more than a mile inside Nicaragua.
   The statement identified the two as Gilberto Moncada Miranda and
Gustavo Adolfo Caliz Gamero of Honduras' 6th Infantry Battalion,
based in Aguas Calientes, Honduras.
   It said the soldiers ``were found doing intelligence work in our
territory'' and called the incident an ``open violation of national
security.''
   There was no immediate comment from the Honduran government.
   The incident followed an exchange of accusations between
Nicaragua and Honduras earlier in the week over fighting between
Sandinista troops and U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels based in
Honduras.
   On Wednesday, the Sandinista government denied Honduran claims
that its soldiers crossed into Honduras to attack a border post.
   The Honduran armed forces had said a number of Sandinista troops
were killed in the fighting, and Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos
Lopez protested the incident.
   Nicaragua said an army patrol was attacked inside Nicaragua by a
group of Contra rebels based in Honduras and that a Sandinista army
soldier was captured and taken to a post six miles inside Honduras.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto protested the
``crude manipulation of the facts'' to Lopez and accused Honduras
of trying ``to create an incident between Honduras and Nicaragua.''
   The body of Porfirio Cruz Lopez, a Sandinista army soldier
mortally wounded in the May 31 fighting with rebels, was returned
Friday to Nicaragua from Honduras at the Las Manos border post in
Nueva Segovia.
   No Honduran military officials were present when the casket
containing Cruz Lopez's remains arrived in Las Manos.
   A Sandinista military delegation received the remains.
   Also Friday, the rebels' military leader said the leftist
government violated a temporary cease-fire in at least 30 recent
attacks against Contra forces in the southeastern part of the
country.
   Enrique Bermudez, speaking on the rebels' clandestine Radio
Liberacion, said the Contras suffered six casualties. He did not
elaborate.
   The Defense Ministry issued a statement saying six rebels were
killed in recent days in northern Nicaragua after Contra forces
attacked army troops who were abiding by the cease-fire.
   Bermudez said in a broadcast monitored in the capital city of
Managua that the fighting could affect the next round of peace
talks scheduled to begin Tuesday between high-level government and
Contra officials.
   The two sides signed a preliminary peace accord March 23 and
agreed on a 60-day truce to give them time to negotiate a permanent
end to the 6{-year-old war.
   The truce expired on Tuesday, but both sides agreed to extend it
until the next round of negotiations. President Daniel Ortega
previously had announced a unilateral 30-day extension.
   Bermudez, a former National Guard colonel during the
dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, took part in the last round of
peace negotiations in Managua held May 26-28. The Sandinistas
blamed his presence in the rebel delegation for the failure of the
talks to produce concrete results.
   In the radio broadcast, Bermudez said the Sandinista attacks on
the rebels occurred in the southeastern provinces of Chontales and
Rio San Juan.
   The Defense Ministry statement said the Contra attacks were
carried out in Nueva Segovia and Jinotega provinces.

<HEAD>Jackson Back In California To Campaign In Town With High Cancer
Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUTTE, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson left the hectic pace of
delegate-rich California for a day to woo voters in less-populous
Montana and New Mexico where, he said, the people's concerns count
more than their political importance.
   Jackson was heading back to California Friday night to spend
today in the rural town of McFarland, which has a mysteriously high
cancer rate. He called on supporters to join him in McFarland to
call for government action in finding and correcting the cause of
the cancer.
   Montana and New Mexico will hold primary elections Tuesday, the
last day of the primary season. But they have been overshadowed by
the expensive contest in California, whose 314 delegates are the
richest prize of all the primaries, and New Jersey, which has 109
delegates.
   By contrast, New Mexico has 24, and Montana 19.
   But Jackson, speaking against a backdrop of white-capped
mountains, a deep blue Montana sky and expansive green plain, told
an airport rally in Bozeman:
   ``We cannot measure human beings and their needs just by their
political capital. ... It's their humanity that's at stake.''
   Later Jackson spoke at a dinner sponsored by the state
Democratic Party in Butte, where he was warmly received by the few
hundred in attendance, most of whom wore Michael Dukakis buttons.
   Jackson told the gathering that in Democrats across the nation,
``There is a rising spirit in the air that we can win.''
   He offered a prayer for Dukakis' wife, Kitty, who underwent
spinal surgery on Friday.
   Noting that the Massachusetts governor was home by his wife's
side, Jackson joked, ``He has done such a good job in
Massachusetts, I'm trying to keep him there four more years.''
   Also speaking at the dinner was John Dukakis, the son of the
front-runner.
   At the Bozeman airport, Jackson talked about the state's Indian
population and the need to respect their culture and religion,
about loss of family farms and ranches, and the need to fight
environmental pollution.
   The crowd of more than 300 was smaller than what Jackson is used
to, but some of his California audiences in the waning days of the
campaign also have lacked the size of his earlier rallies.
   Earlier, he spoke to more than 1,500 people in the trendy
central plaza of Santa Fe, N,M.
   There he said that environmental concerns are ``No longer a
fringe issue'' but are central to human existence.
   He spoke on the sun-baked plaza surrounded by the city's
trademark Indian sidewalk vendors who sell an array of turquoise
and silver jewelry.
   Jackson spoke of the controversy about federal plans to store
nuclear waste near Carlsbad and said, ``Safety before waste, that
must be your watchword.''
   Jackson said he did not know the context of reported comments by
his campaign manager Gerald Austin that the strongest Democratic
ticket would be Dukakis and Sen. John Glenn of Ohio.
   But he told reporters, ``Don't take that seriously.''
   Austin was quoted in the Boston Herald as saying Jackson was his
first choice for vice president with Dukakis, but that Glenn would
make for an almost unbeatable ticket.
   Jackson dismissed the report, repeating his earlier assertions
that if Dukakis wins, Jackson deserves consideration for vice
president, and vice versa.
   Jackson has taken up the McFarland issue as a central cause of
his campaign in its closing days. He mentioned it in all his Los
Angeles speeches over the past two days.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Assess Impact of Navy's Shipyard Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers reacted to Navy forecasts of reduced
workforces at eight public shipyards with letters, planned
legislation and a resolve to keep employment at current levels.
   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., said Friday that the Navy's public
yards face a tough fight in the coming years.
   ``I can see a day where one or two of the public yards might not
exist because of the downturn of overhaul work,'' he said. ``It's
an ongoing struggle.''
   A Naval Sea Systems Command planning document obtained Wednesday
by The Associated Press projects a reduction from 71,100 to 56,400
jobs at the public yards by the end of 1991.
   The document contains job estimates based on anticipated ship
overhaul and modernization schedules.
   The systems command, which oversees the Navy's eight yards, said
Wednesday that ``exact naval shipyard employment figures will not
be determined until the budget process is completed for fiscal year
1989 and beyond.''
   The planning document was born out of a fleet scheduling
conference in May during which the Navy and its shipyard commanders
took a long-range view of the overhaul workload.
   The Navy still can adjust its assignments to reflect overhaul
budgets set by Congress for individual years. In addition, Congress
occasionally forces the Navy's hand by mandating that a certain
ship or class of ships be assigned to a specific yard for repairs.
   Congress has not yet completed work on the federal budget for
fiscal year 1989, which begins Oct. 1. Even after the spending bill
is passed, however, the Navy is given discretion to juggle
workforce sizes. In effect, the process of assigning overhaul work
and fixing employment levels never ends, so long as the Navy
remains within its budget.
   The employment forecasts and planned overhaul assignment
schedules alarmed Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., who said he would take
steps to prevent or minimize job losses at the Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard, which now employs about 8,700.
   Heinz said the Philadelphia area congressional delegation will
introduce legislation to require that the Philadelphia yard have
the opportunity to compete for electronics and computer work on
ships.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., wrote to Navy Secretary
William L. Ball III and to fellow Appropriations Committee members
warning that a plan ruling out the electronics upgrades at
Philadelphia until 1991 would cause the yard to lose skilled
workers who represent a valuable Navy investment.
   The Philadelphia yard's workforce could be as low as 6,800 at
the end of the 1991 fiscal year, according to projections in the
working document.
   Dicks, whose district contains the Puget Sound yard, termed the
planning document ``a bare-bones projection'' and said he did not
believe employment would drop as low as predicted because past
forecasts of employment have normally been lower than the job
levels actually recorded.
   Dicks said employment at the yards, already down 9 percent since
January 1985, should not drop further for reasons of national
security.
   ``I think they should stay where they are now, and I'm going to
do everything I can to fight the decline,'' Dicks said.
   He said Puget Sound and other public yards ``have been quite
competitive'' so far in their battle to keep from losing too much
ground to private yards.
   Private yards, which already handle all new Navy ship
construction, have been competing for a larger share of overhauls.
   A General Accounting Office report in March found that,
``Overall, private shipyards are being awarded an increasing share
of the funds for all overhaul and repair work.''

<TEXT>
   Sales of domestic cars and trucks picked up late
last month, helping produce a 15.8 percent increase for the month
against a year ago, while import sales declined 3.1 percent, auto
companies reported.
   The eight companies that build cars and trucks in the United
States sold 437,233 vehicles in the eight selling days from May
21-31, up 14.8 percent from 380,732 in the identical period a year
ago.
   Together, domestic automakers sold 12.5 percent more North
American-made cars and 19.2 percent more domestic trucks than in
late May 1987.
   Overall sales of cars and light trucks, imported and domestic,
were up 10.8 during the month compared with May 1987.
   ``With less generous (sales) incentives ... we've still got some
momentum underneath this market, some good underlying strength,''
said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in
New York.
   Domestic car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. rose 13.4 percent in late May from a year ago, while
Big Three domestic light truck sales jumped 17.9 percent, the
makers reported.
   In late May, GM and Ford increased their shares of the domestic
car market while Chrysler's share slipped slightly despite a 6.5
percent increase in sales. Together, the Big Three held 89 percent
of the domestic market.
   GM's late May domestic car sales rose 14.3 percent from a year
ago; Ford's rose 15.2 percent.
   Ford's domestic truck sales slipped 1.7 percent in late May,
along with its share of the market, while GM's truck sales rose
44.3 percent and its share grew to 42.9 percent from 35.4 percent
in late May a year ago.
   Chrysler's domestic truck sales, which include Jeep products,
were up 10.6 percent, but its share of the market fell slightly.
The Big Three control 97 percent of the domestic truck market.
   During all of May, foreign and domestic makers together sold
1,433,365 cars and light trucks. Domestic car sales rose 12.8
percent while domestic truck sales jumped 21.4 percent from May
1987.
   But while import car sales rose 3.6 percent from May 1987,
import truck sales fell 25.5 percent.
   During May, imported Japanese cars and light trucks made up 17.1
percent of all vehicles sold, a decline from 19.7 percent in May
1987. European car sales remained 23 percent lower than in May a
year ago.
   However, makers of some luxury European models, including
Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, reported a gradual return of customers who
were scared off earlier by the stock market collapse and
skyrocketing prices.

   A report of a possible explosion and
radiation leak at a Martin-Marietta research facility near
Catonsville late Friday resulted from a false alarm, authorities
said.
   ``It was an apparent malfunction of the alarm system,'' said
James Friedline, a supervisor at the Baltimore County Fire
Department. Twenty firefighting units, with some 60 firefighters
rushed to the scene after the initial report, Friedline said.
   Cpl. Kevin Novak, a supervising dispatcher at the Baltimore
County Police Department said initial radio reports from the scene
indicated a possible radiation leak inside the building. But
emergency crews reported finding no leak and no sign of an
explosion.
   No one was evacuated. Interstate 95, which runs near the plant,
was not closed to traffic.
   The research facility is located in southeast Baltimore County,
about 5 miles south of the Baltimore city limits. It conducts
wide-ranging research in areas ranging from artificial intelligence
to chemistry and metallurgy.

<HEAD>Heir Apparent to Western Samoan Throne Gets Diploma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALISBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of his prep-school classmates
expect to be doctors, lawyers or businessmen one day, but
17-year-old Malietau Malietoa has bigger plans _ ruler of Western
Samoa.
   Malietoa, who graduated Friday, is a prince of Western Samoa and
heir apparent to the tiny Pacific island nation's throne.
   ``Often I sit up late at night and think about this,'' said
Malietoa, who is known as Tau among his classmates.
   The student who would be king _ or tupu, as it is known in the
Samoan language _ spent the past year at the Episcopal all-male
school to learn Western ways to help him lead his country, now
ruled by his 73-year-old grandfather.
   An uncle who is an adviser to his grandfather suggested the
school in northwest Connecticut, and Malietoa agreed because he
wanted to live in a cold climate for a change.
   He has tried skiing, and played on the school basketball team,
although he confesses he did not totally understand the game.
   ``I think I was a wing or a guard,'' he said recently. ``Yes, I
think I was a guard.''
   His grandfather is the latest head of state in a dynasty that
goes back 1,500 years. Malietoa's father died in 1984. His son says
that made him the heir apparent.
   However, Nusi Mavala, chief administrator of the Samoan Mission
at the United Nations, said the matai, a group of titled heads of
leading families, would vote on a new head of state if anything
happened to Malietoa's grandfather, and there could be other
claimants. He said Malietoa could be the leading claimant.
   Malietoa has been a good student and has fit in well with other
students, ``but he's more serious than most,'' said the Rev. Peter
W. Sipple, head of Salisbury.
   Malietoa has no immediate plans for college, but is looking into
the possibility of enrolling at Harvard University as a special
tutorial student in studies that would be useful in governing a
nation.
   There are two countries in the Samoan chain of 16 volcanic
islands in the South Pacific.
   Six of the islands make up American Samoa, which has been under
U.S. control since 1900. The others make up Western Samoa, a
country of 1,130 square miles, about one-fifth the size of
Connecticut, with a population of 165,000.
   Malietoa describes Western Samoa as a benevolent but absolute
monarchy. Its economy is tied to bananas, copra and taro roots, as
it has been for centuries. It has its own currency but only for
internal use.
   ``We are poor, but we do not have hunger,'' he said.

   Six miners buried 330 feet
underground for more than two days after an explosion in a coal
shaft were found alive early Saturday, Hesse State radio said.
   The radio said the six were discovered by rescuers in a pocket
of air. They were exhausted but otherwise appeared not be seriously
injured, the report said.
   The six men were among 57 miners in the shaft when the explosion
occurred Wednesday. The radio said there was hope that more
survivors may be found.
   By late Friday, rescuers had found 36 bodies and had brought 28
bodies to the surface.
   The first of the six survivors was brought to the surface at
about 5.30 a.m., the radio said.
   The blast at the Stolzenbach mine in the town of Borken, 72
miles northeast of Frankfurt, trapped the miners 330 feet below the
surface and by Thursday mine officials had given up hope of finding
anyone alive.
   The survivors were found about 60 hours after the accident.
   Rescuers said earlier that there were high concentrations of
deadly carbon monoxide in the mine.
   The survivors may have been helped by fresh air being constantly
pumped into the mine to aid the rescuers, the radio said.
   Experts were still trying to determine what caused the blast.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for movie and television
producers and scriptwriters agreed to continue contract talks this
weekend in an attempt to resolve a 13-week strike by the Writers
Guild of America.
   Both sides met Friday at the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers offices in Sherman Oaks but refused to say
what progress was made.
   ``People were very frank and candid. I think there is certainly
a new commitment to try on both sides,'' Brian Walton, executive
director of the guild told reporters after the meeting. He refused
to give details.
   Both sides said talks would continue over the weekend.
   Earlier Friday, striking scriptwriters sought to enlist owners
of ABC-TV affiliate stations nationwide in their labor dispute,
claiming the strike has caused television audiences to dwindle.
   The guild sent letters to owners and managers of 198 ABC
affiliates, urging them to press ABC to give ground in negotiations
to prevent further delays in the start of the fall TV season.
   The union will send similar letters to CBS and NBC affiliates,
said Cheryl Rhoden, spokeswoman for the guild. The ABC letters went
out first because the network's annual meeting for affiliates will
begin Monday in Los Angeles, she said.
   The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute that centers on
residuals, the payments they receive for reruns of one-hour
television shows. Demand for one-hour shows in rerun, or
syndication, is declining, and the producers had sought to index
residual payments to a show's rerun success.
   Lack of material has forced the networks to delay the fall
premieres of a number of series, and the writers, in their letter
to ABC affiliates, suggested quality had suffered as well.
   ``This strike is not only hurting writers. It's hurting you,''
the union letter said.
   TV's viewing audience declined 3 percent in the May rating
period, the letter said, ``and it's only going to get worse.''
   The absence of writers has forced studios to order TV movies
without needed rewrites, and the delayed fall shows will be rushed
into production, the letter said.
   In addition to residuals, other issues in the strike are
writers' demands for more say over changes made in scripts during
filming and greater credit for their work both on and off screen.
   The guild has signed independent contracts with about 80
independent producers, but the producers alliance maintains that
none of its large members have signed and that the producers who
did defect employ only a tiny fraction of the 3,000 active writers.

   One man served American presidents from
Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy, the other served Soviet leaders
in the central committee of the Communist party. Now they've
written a book together to show the faults and virtues of the
Soviet Union and the United States.
   ``We wanted to discuss the failures of the two systems,''
explained John Kenneth Galbraith, a former ambassador to India and
at 79 one of this country's best known economists.
   Stanislav Menshikov, 61, is the son of a former Soviet
ambassador in Washington. He agrees with Galbraith that the worst
problem the two systems have in common is bureaucracy. Galbraith is
concerned about bureaucracies in corporations; Menshikov about the
Soviet government.
   ``Our bureaucracy is more dangerous, more stifling, because it's
running not only the government but industry,'' Menshikov says.
   He now edits ``World Marxist Review'' in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
It is an official Communist organ published in 42 languages.
   They came together Friday night in a gilt-and-cream colored
salon of the Soviet embassy. They have met many times since they
first were introduced 24 years ago in a similar setting: Spaso
House, residence of the U.S. ambassador in Moscow.
   This time they were publicizing their book: ``Capitalism,
Communism and Coexistence: from a Bitter Past to a Better
Prospect.''
   The two spoke in brief interviews between greeting guests,
giving autographs and posing for pictures.
   Galbraith cited what he sees as parallels between Soviet and
American problems: the shortage of labor in ``low prestige''
industries, what he called the hardening of the arteries in big
industrial organizations.
   ``Some Soviet steel complexes are a lot like Pittsburgh,'' he
said.
   Menshikov compared the changes Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to
make in the Soviet Union with those made in this country under
Franklin Roosevelt. Both sets of reforms were designed to change
their systems in order to preserve them, he said.
   ``In Roosevelt's case what was the alternative?'' he asked. ``A
right-wing dictatorship, fascism _ or maybe communism.''
   He did not suggest what the alternatives to Gorbachev's reforms
would be.
   There are two kinds of coexistence, Menshikov explained.
   ``One is based on fear, on nuclear weapons _ it's unstable and
it can take you to the brink in no time: two ships that collide in
the Black Sea, two ladies who disagree and influence their
husbands,'' he said.
   Then he added: ``That's just a joke, of course, about the
ladies.''
   He suggested that in another kind of coexistence different
systems could live side by side just as different religions live
side by side in many countries.
   ``You remember there was a time when just to belong to a
different religion meant you were a hateful enemy,'' he said.
   The two men want to believe that kind of relationship will no
longer exist between people in the Soviet Union and the United
States.
   ``Our deeper purpose was to show that an American and a Russian
of different views could engage in civil and, we hoped, informative
discussions of our different and common problems,'' Galbraith
writes in the introduction to the American edition.
   Menshikov has written an introduction to the Russian edition, to
appear soon in Moscow.

   The military is buying more parts than it
needs because of problems identifying the items in its inventory
catalog, a congressional study says.
   The U.S. General Accounting Office report, released Friday, said
the Federal Catalog System does not meet the congressional mandate
that every cataloged item be identified in a way that distinguishes
it from other parts.
   The GAO said it is conceivable that millions of dollars are
being needlessly spent to buy, catalog, store and issue duplicates
of items.
   ``The extent of duplication and other logistics problems caused
by inadequate item identification, or the unnecessary costs
incurred as a result, are largely unknown,'' the GAO concluded.
``However, these problems may be serious and costly.''
   The Federal Catalog System was established in 1952 to provide a
uniform cataloging system among the military services. By
identifying and differentiating supply items, cataloging enables
the government to know what it has in stock so it does not buy
items already in its inventory.
   The GAO said that as of the end of 1986, 30 percent of all
cataloged items did not have approved names and 29 percent were
described just well enough to meet minimum requirements.
   ``Thousands of items were misclassified or assigned duplicate
numbers in the federal catalog,'' the GAO added.
   Defense Department officials said the use of approved item names
has received greater emphasis in the past two years.
   ``The need to improve item identifications and reduce duplicate
items in the Federal Catalog System are central to many of the
ongoing efforts in the cataloging community,'' Jack Katzen, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for systems, said in a letter to the
GAO.
   The GAO said the Defense Logistics Agency has recently taken
several steps to improve item identification, but that for the most
part it is too early to gauge their effectiveness.

   Six miners buried 330 feet
underground for more than two days after an explosion in a coal
shaft were found alive early Saturday.
   Hesse State radio said rescuers discovered the survivors in an
air pocket. They were exhausted but otherwise appeared not be
seriously injured, the report said.
   A spokesman for Preussen Elektra, the company which owns the
mine, also said the six did not suffer serious injuries and were
reunited with their families.
   The six men were among 57 miners in the shaft when the explosion
occurred Wednesday. The radio said rescuers were now hoping to find
more survivors.
   On Thursday, mine officials had given up hope of finding any of
the minors alive. By late Friday, rescuers had found 36 bodies and
had brought 30 bodies to the surface, according to the company
spokesman. Fifteen miners were still missing.
   The first of the six survivors was brought to the surface early
Saturday morning, about 60 hours after the explosion.
   Of the six, five were West Germans and one a Turk. There were 14
Turkish workers among the 57 miners trapped by the blast.
   Rescue workers said earlier that there were high concentrations
of deadly carbon monoxide in the mine. The radio report said the
survivors may have been helped by fresh air pumped into the mine to
aid the rescuers.
   Wednesday's blast at the Stolzenbach mine in the town of Borken,
72 miles northeast of Frankfurt, trapped the miners 330 feet below
the surface. The methane gas explosion rocked the ground like an
earthquake.
   On Friday, before the survivors were found, grieving family
members gathered at a makeshift morgue to say farewell to the
victims of West Germany's worst mining disaster in 26 years.
Turkish immigrants were among the dead.
   Also Friday, Heinz-Werner Meyer, the head of the union
representing 350,000 West German miners and energy workers, called
for ``an improvement of safety underground.''
   ``A thorough investigation of the causes of the accident and the
implementation of all possible safety measures are needed to
minimize the danger of an accident,'' Meyer said in an interview on
Saarland Radio.
   But Heinz Cramer, a member of the board of the company that owns
the ill-fated mine, said after the disaster: ``All safety measures
were adhered to.''
   A local prosecutor in the town of Borken was investigating the
accident to see if any criminal charges were warranted.
   Experts were still trying to determine what caused the blast.
   Rescue workers pulled the bodies to the surface using breathing
masks to shield them against dangerous levels of the deadly carbon
monoxide that had killed some of the miners.
   Many of the miners whose bodies have been retrieved suffocated
from lack of air after their emergency breathing masks ran out of
oxygen, while others died from their injuries, officials said.
   The blast killed about one-third of the work force at the
Preussen Elektra mine. The company is the leading employer in
Borken and one of West Germany's largest utilities.
   Peter Carl Ruehland, spokesman for Preussen Elektra, said the
company would pay funeral costs and the costs of flying the
immigrant workers' bodies back to Turkey, if family members
requested it.
   The Borken explosion is the worst West German mining accident
since 299 men died in 1962 at the Luisenthal mine in Saarland state
along the border with France.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Military Burden Forced Gorbachev's Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has to reform the Soviet Union because his people can no
longer endure their military burden.
   ``They could not have gone on surviving as they were,'' the
British leader told a television interviewer at her 10 Downing
Street office Friday night.
   She spoke a few hours after saying goodbye to President Reagan,
who stopped over in London on his way home after his Moscow summit
with Gorbachev.
   In a separate interview with commercial Independent Television
News, Mrs. Thatcher said she knew it was impossible for the two
superpower leaders to reach agreement on strategic nuclear arms
reductions this week in Moscow.
   She said: ``It is a very complicated equation. I knew it was not
possible to do it. So, I think, did Mr. Gorbachev.''
   Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. program
``Newsnight,'' Mrs. Thatcher, who herself met with Gorbachev in
Moscow in spring 1987, said: ``I had the feeling that certainly
many people at the top in the Soviet Union _ and I believe many
other people as well _ knew they could not have gone on surviving
as they were.
   ``They could not go on with that military strength because
people wanted a higher standard of living.
   ``They had to change, and when you change, you do not know quite
the speed at which it will go. You do not know the difficulties,''
she said.
   Gorbachev has pushed a wide-ranging program of social and
economic reforms, which he calls ``perestroika'' or restructuring.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies
said in its annual, ``The Military Balance,'' in November that
while there was very little reliable information on Soviet defense
spending over the past year, it had announced at the end of 1986 a
record defense budget of $30.4 billion.
   However, the institute said most Western observers believed the
announced Soviet defense figures are only one-tenth or less of what
is actually spent. U.S. officials have put Soviet defense spending
at 16 to 17 percent of the country's gross national product.
   The institute said that would amount to $700 billion, compared
to the U.S. congressionally-approved figure of $296 billion for the
1988 U.S. defense budget.
   Mrs. Thatcher described Gorbachev's vision for his country as a
``miracle'' and said he was sticking to his reforming vision with
``great constancy and determination.''

   A strong earthquake rattled the
lower part of New Zealand's South Island today, cutting electricity
to thousands of customers, shattering windows and causing several
landslides, officials said.
   No-one was reported injured by the quake, which registered 6.5
on the Richter scale, police said.
   In Washington, the U.S. Geological Survey reported that the
quake was the strongest tremor in the general area in more than 12
years, since a magnitude 6.7 earthquake on May 4, 1976.
   The 11:37 a.m. quake was centered in the Southern Alps near the
southwest corner of South Island, near Lake Te Anau and about 450
miles southwest of Wellington.
   Landslides closed two roads. Several water mains also burst
because of the tremor.
   The New Zealand Seismological Observatory said the quake was
similar to the one which caused severe damage to the town of
Edgecumbe and other parts of the Bay of Plenty district in March
last year.
   ``If it had occured in a more populated area there would likely
have been a lot of damage,'' said Dr. Ewan Smith, seismologist at
the Wellington observatory.
   Senior Constable Lloyd Matheson of Te Anau police station
described the quake as ``a very strong rocking motion _ shuddering
with a large roaring noise.''
   In addition to cutting power to an estimated 40,000 consumers in
Christchurch, the quake interrupted power supplies to the town of
Te Anau and parts of the city of Invercargill, 80 miles south of
the lake, police said.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by
an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

<HEAD>Democrats Say GOP Vulnerable on Family Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Democratic party's
platform committee says the party can regain the White House by
focusing on issues affecting U.S. families and developing proposals
that are affordable.
   ``We are picking this issue because we felt it is a new frontier
for America. We have a good record of family issues,'' said
Michigan Gov. James Blanchard Friday at an issues forum.
   ``The Republicans have spent the last eight years trying to
regulate our bedrooms and tell us what prayers to pray,'' added
Blanchard, who heads the 163-member panel that will prepare a
platform for the Democratic National Convention in July.
   Blanchard said Republicans had gutted programs affecting
low-income families, the young and the elderly, and Americans see a

voters such initiatives are financially feasible.

<HEAD>Bush Campaign `Preferred Delegates Lists' Irritates Colorado GOP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some state Republicans are angry because Vice
President George Bush's Colorado campaign is pushing so-called
``preferred delegates lists'' as state delegates to the Republican
National Convention.
   The handpicked choices being supported by the Bush campaign are
made up mostly of his campaign workers.
   Bush's son, Neil of Denver, has been campaigning for the slates
and said the move is not divisive.
   ``We're doing it for party unity sake, because we've included in
our statewide delegate list for tomorrow people from (New York Rep.
Jack) Kemp and (Kansas Sen. Bob) Dole,'' he said Friday.
   Eighteen delegates have been picked and the remaining 18 are to
be selected today at the party's state convention at McNichols
Sports Arena.

   An Army sergeant decorated
for heroism in Vietnam was sentenced to 10 years in prison and
ordered discharged for passing military documents to an FBI agent
posing as a Soviet spy.
   The military jury that convicted and sentenced Sgt. Daniel
Walter Richardson, 42, on Friday also fined him $36,000, demoted
him and stripped him of his Army pension.
   Richardson, whose 19 years in the Army include 2{ tours of duty
in Vietnam, a commendation for heroism while there and other
honors, was to begin serving the prison term immediately.
   ``I'm still taking care of business right now,'' the Oakland,
Calif., native said. ``My lawyers have advised me not to say
anything at this time.''
   The jury found Richardson guilty of selling unclassified pages
from a military manual and describing circuitry in the M1 tank on
Jan. 13, but acquitted him of a charge that he met with the FBI
agent Jan. 14 and accepted a $1,500 down payment on a $50,000 deal
before his arrest that day.
   Richardson contended throughout his weeklong court-martial at
this Army base nearly 10 miles northeast of Baltimore that he was
not trying to sell out his country, but was trying to catch a spy
to impress his superiors.
   He was convicted of attempted espionage, stealing government
property, the unauthorized sale of government property and failure
to report an attempt by an unauthorized person to obtain classified
information, but was cleared of a second count of attempted
espionage.
   Richardson was demoted from a class E5 sergeant to an E1,
cutting his pay in half until his discharge, which will become
effective after the sentence is reviewed.
   The conviction and sentence must be approved by the commander of
Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maj. Gen. George Akin, and automatically
will be appealed to the Army Court of Military Review.
   If the conviction is upheld, Richardson will receive a
bad-conduct discharge and will lose all pay and pension benefits,
said Army spokesman R. Rex Brookshire.
   The jury took 2{ hours to decide on the sentence.
   Defense attorney David Heubeck said he believed the panel did
not hand his client the maximum penalty of life in prison because
lawyers described him as a man who loved his country, was
distraught over the 1987 slaying of his son and was troubled by
alcoholism, depression and gambling problems.
   Richardson's stepbrother, Frank Workman, testified that he
believed the defendant's account. ``He did it to catch a spy, it's
plain and simple.''
   Prosecutors portrayed Richardson as a greedy, vengeful man who
was willing to jeopardize national security for money.
   ``He has an anti-social personality,'' said the chief
prosecutor, Capt. Wellington T. Matthews Jr. ``He's a crook. He's a
criminal.''
   According to testimony, Richardson phoned the Soviet Embassy in
Washington in July 1986. Eighteen months later, the FBI agent
called him, posing as a Soviet operative.
   Richardson had been demoted from instructor in the Tank Turret
Division at the proving ground to supervisor of the tool room for
repeatedly failing to show up for work.
   ``I figured that I needed to do something to get everybody off
my back, so I called the Russian Embassy, to try to get a KGB
agent,'' Richardson testified Thursday.
   ``It seemed like everything I tried to do right, it got screwed
up,'' he said. ``I felt that I was under so much pressure all the
time, I felt like I was going to explode from the inside out.''

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   JESSE JACKSON, assuring smaller crowds that greeted him as he
campaigned in Montana that he was as concerned about them as he was
about the larger groups that he had met earlier in the campaign:
``We cannot measure human beings and their needs just by their
political capital. ... It's their humanity that's at stake.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, saying his wife who is recovering from delicate
back surgery won't join him when he resumes campaigning for
Tuesday's final four primaries: ``I talked to Kitty in the recovery
room and she said she wanted an ice cream and a massage. I'm
prepared to provide both. ... She certainly is not going to be able
to do any serious campaigning for a while.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, saluting President Reagan on his return from the
Moscow summit: ``This week, an American president strode the hard
ground of Red Square and reminded the world through the sureness of
his step and the lilting of his words ... what a moving and bracing
thing freedom is. The fact is, you made us proud.''

<HEAD>Testimony About Meese At Wedtech Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III asked about a
contract for Wedtech Corp., a witness in the racketeering trial
involving the scandal-plagued defense contractor said in the first
testimony on what Meese allegedly said.
   Meese has denied helping the Bronx contractor obtain the Navy
pontoon contract.
   However, former Wedtech President Anthony Guariglia on Friday
testified at the U.S. District Court trial of U.S. Rep. Mario
Biaggi and six others that Meese asked about the contract at a
diplomatic ball in Washington in 1985.
   Biaggi and the others are accused of turning Wedtech, which is
now in bankruptcy, into a racketeering enterprise for the payment
of bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts.
   Guariglia is the last of four former Wedtech officials who have
pleaded guilty to corruption charges to testify at the trial in
exchange for leniency.
   He was the first witness to testify at the 13-week-old trial
about anything Meese allegedly said about the contract.
   Guariglia and other company officials have said they paid
$800,000 to attorney E. Robert Wallach, a close friend and
associate of Meese, to influence the attorney general.
   They have said Wallach told them he got Meese to intercede on
Wedtech's behalf for a series of contracts worth $143 million to
build pontoons.
   Wallach is under indictment on federal racketeering charges for
allegedly taking payoffs from Wedtech officials to influence Meese
and other public officials.
   Guariglia told the jury that Wallach introduced him, Wedtech
founder John Mariotta and other company officials to Meese and his
wife at an ambassador's ball in Washington.
   ``Mr. Wallach said to Mr. Meese what a fine job we were doing in
the South Bronx, that the company was growing and employment was
growing,'' said Guariglia.
   ``Mr. Meese asked how we were doing with the pontoon contract.
Mr. Mariotta said `Fine.' Mr. Meese asked if we were on time with
our deliveries, and I believe Mr. Mariotta said `Fine,' and that
was the end of the meeting.''
   Meese, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, has denied
any involvement in that contract, but admitted intervening with the
Army to help Wedtech win an engine contract in 1982 while he was
presidential counselor.
   Meese attorney Nathan Lewin said Friday that because the
attorney general was in Germany, ``I can't give any direct comment
on whether he recalls or doesn't recall making that statement.
   ``If that statement was made by him (Meese), it is consistent
with his statements concerning his limited involvement or knowledge
of Wedtech matters,'' said Lewin, reached at his Washington office.
   Lewin said Meese ``has acknowledged that he had been told by
Wallach that Wedtech had obtained a pontoon contract.''

<HEAD>Brazilians Want No More Excuses From President</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRAZILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that President Jose Sarney has won
his coveted fifth year in office, Brazilians say he has also lost
his excuse for not boosting the nation's faltering economy.
   Congressmen, even leftists opposed to Sarney, expressed relief
the controversial issue was finally laid to rest when lawmakers on
Thursday gave him his long-sought extra year.
   However, many also said it was time for Sarney to show his stuff.
   ``Now, he has no more excuses,'' said Rep. Delfin Netto.
   Added Sen. Mario Covas, ``We'll see if finally his government
takes some initiative.''
   For his part, the president promised action. ``I will now
perform my duties with even more responsibility,'' said Sarney, the
nation's first civilian leader after 21 years of military rule.
   Legislators, who since February have been rewriting Brazil's
eighth constitution, voted in an historic session to give Sarney
the five years he fought so hard for. The vote was 328 in favor,
222 against, with three abstentions.
   The vote means 75 million Brazilians, including a generation in
their 40s who have never voted for president, will go to the polls
in November 1989, 29 years after the last presidential balloting.
   Polls have shown in the past year that most people in this
country of 143 million people wanted elections for president in
November 1988. Instead, elections will be held a year later, and
Sarney will step down in March 15, 1990.
   Sarney has said he has been ``hostage'' to the Constituent
Assembly, which took nearly a year and a half to lengthen his
four-year term.
   The president said uncertainty over his political future was at
the center of Brazil's triple-digit inflation, which has hit an
all-time high under his administration.
   Sarney also said he needed an extra year to consolidate Brazil's
transition to democracy. He said it would help in negotiations with
the International Monetary Fund and international bankers on
Brazil's $121 billion debt.
   He further hinted Brazil's democracy was at risk if he was
ousted after a four-year term, meaning Brazil's armed forces
wouldn't accept elections this year for fear of a leftist surge.
   Yet opponents of the five-year term see it differently.
   Sarney critics who crowded the public stands as voting took
place Thursday unfurled a flag reading: ``Five years _ betrayal to
the people.''
   Sarney's term was up for a vote because he was not popularly
elected. The 57-year-old provincial politician and poet from the
poor northeastern state of Maranhao came to power as the vice
president for the popular statesman Tancredo Neves, who died before
taking office.
   They were elected in indirect electoral college voting called by
military generals, who put Sarney on the Neves ticket. The vote was
to pave the way for non-miliary rule in this country where the
armed forces had governed since a 1964 coup.
   Although legally entitled to six years under the existing
constitution, Neves promised his transition government would end
after four years and that the Constituent Assembly would decide on
the next elections.
   Sarney initially said he only wanted a four-year term. Last
year, he said he needed another year because he had been unable to
put into effect the government programs he wanted and that there
was political uncertainty.
   Newspapers criticized the longer term and charged Sarney used
his political influence unethically.
   The powerful daily Folha de Sao Paulo wrote: ``The five-year
vote cost how many privileges and at what cost to the taxpayer?''
   The influential Rio de Janeiro newspaper said: ``President
Sarney obtained what he wanted: a fifth year to try to do what he
was uncapable of doing in three.''

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 supporters of Ferdinand
Marcos marched behind his mother's hearse today and flashed victory
signs as her body was brought home to await burial.
   The exiled president's family, which had hoped to convince
President Corazon Aquino to allow Marcos to return for the funeral,
said they had not yet set a burial date. It has been one month
since 95-year-old Josefa Edralin-Marcos died.
   Today's 90-minute procession accompanied her body from a
suburban Roman Catholic church, where it had lain in state, to her
home several blocks away.
   At least four police cars headed the procession. Traffic jammed
on many streets as the procession inched its way to the house in
the Manila suburb of San Juan.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body had been kept at the Santuario de San
Jose church since she died in a hospital on May 4.
   Her two children in Manila, Pacifico Marcos and Fortuna
Marcos-Barba, had set no date for the funeral in hope that their
exiled brother would be allowed to attend the burial.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly said she won't allow Marcos to return
to the country for fear his presence would endanger national
security.
   Marcos' supporters have held numerous street demonstrations
since Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' death to demand that Mrs. Aquino change
her mind and allow him to return.
   Marcos lives in Hawaii, where he fled with his immediate family
after the February 1986 civilian and military revolt that ended his
20-year rule and swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Asked when the funeral would be held, Pacifico Marcos said,
``It's very hard to predict.'' He said he was still hoping his
elder brother would be able to come home for the burial.
   But Mrs. Marcos-Barba told reporters later that she would
telephone Marcos in Honolulu in two or three days to set a date for
the funeral in the family's hometown of Batac, 240 miles north of
Manila.
   ``We really have to start planning, and I suppose we'll have to
do that,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of ``Casey at the Bat,'' by
Ernest L. Thayer:
   
   The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;
   The score stood four to two with but one inning more to play.
   And then Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
   A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.
   
   A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
   Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
   They thought if only Casey could but get a whack at that _
   We'd put up even money now with Casey at the bat.
   
   But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
   And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake;
   So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
   For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.
   
   But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
   And Blake, the much despis-ed, tore the cover off the ball;
   And when the dust had lifted, and the men saw what had occurred,
   There was Johnnie safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.
   
   Then from 5,000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
   It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
   It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
   For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.
   
   There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
   There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face.
   And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
   No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.
   
   Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
   Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.
   Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
   Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.
   
   And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
   And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
   Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped _
   ``That ain't my style,'' said Casey. ``Strike one,'' the umpire
said.
   
   From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled
roar,
   Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.
   ``Kill him! Kill the umpire!'' shouted some one on the stand;
   And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his
hand.
   
   With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
   He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
   He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;
   But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, ``Strike two.''
   
   ``Fraud!'' cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered fraud;
   But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
   They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles
strain,
   And they knew that Casey wouldn't let the ball go by again.
   
   The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in
hate;
   He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.
   And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
   And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.
   
   Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;
   The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,
   And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;
   But there is no joy in Mudville _ mighty Casey has struck out.

<HEAD>Sunken Japanese Ships Found in Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOROR, Palau (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divers have discovered 55 Japanese warships,
cargo boats and submarines sunk during World War II off Palau in
the western Pacific Ocean, the government announced.
   ``No one knew they were there,'' government spokesman Bonifacio
Basilius said Friday.
   Elderly Palauans believe the vessels were part of the Japanese
fleet used to protect the Philippines that had moved to Malakal
Harbor off Koror, Palau's capital, Basilius said.
   Japanese ships anchored at Malakal and Airai Harbor were
attacked by U.S. carrier-based fighter planes in March and July
1944, he said.
   Japan occupied Palau, which is about 600 miles east of the
Philippines and nearly 2,000 miles south of Tokyo, from 1922 until
American forces captured the island chain in 1945.
   The ships were found during the past four weeks by U.S. Navy
reservists on summer duty from Honolulu, Long Beach, Calif., San
Diego, and Texas, Basilius said.
   The U.S. National Park Service has been locating and marking
sunken ships, the spokesman said. The joint Park Service-Navy
project is expected to end in two weeks.
   Most of the search has been in and around Palau's rock islands,
which are limestone coral reefs with a mushroom-like appearance
created by wave erosion. None are inhabited.
   The divers are using underwater robots with cameras, Basilius
said. None of the ships were visible from the ocean surface, and
some have been found in waters 150 feet deep. Most were less than
five miles from shore.
   Divers were able to read the names on five of the ships, which
they described as in good shape for being under water for more than
40 years, Basilius said. The warships seemed to be destroyers.
   Palauans have known about a dozen other sunken Japanese ships,
Basilius said.

<HEAD>Jurors Clear Blood Bank in AIDS Liability Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state jury cleared a blood bank of liability in
the AIDS infection of a woman who received a tainted transfusion,
and a defense attorney said it was a victory for blood banks facing
similar lawsuits.
   The Denver District Court jury on Friday found United Blood
Services not liable for damages in the case of Susie Quintana, 50,
of Dolores, who contracted AIDS from a 1983 transfusion after an
accidental gunshot wound. The blood was from the United Blood
Services bank in Albuquerque, N.M.
   The six-member jury Thursday ordered an infectious disease
expert whose AIDS test falsely found Mrs. Quintana free of the
virus to pay $70,000 in damages, but found no liability on the part
of her former family doctor.
   Lawyers have said the case may be the first in the nation in
which a jury decided an AIDS victim's claim against a blood bank.
In a similar case in California in 1986, a settlement was reached
before the trial ended.
   ``There are many lawsuits, and they (the jurors) have done a
great service to blood banks around the country,'' defense attorney
Steve Labensky said after the verdict. ``Defense attorneys around
the country were watching this. A victory here will probably assure
a victory elsewhere.''
   Wiping tears from her eyes, Mrs. Quintana said she knew the jury
faced a ``tough decision'' in her case. ``But it means AIDS
patients will just have to keep fighting,'' said the mother of
four. ``I've fought this thing every since I found out I had it,
and I'll continue to fight it.''
   Mrs. Quintana and her 53-year-old husband, Chris, have not
decided whether to appeal, said their attorney, Maureen Reidy Witt.
   The southwest Colorado couple's suit sought unspecified damages,
but Witt asked the jury in closing arguments to award Quintanas
more than $13 million.
   The jury said the infectious disease expert, Dr. Donald Kearns,
was liable because he failed to explain precautions the couple
should have taken to avoid exposing Mrs. Quintana's husband to
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Although the Quintanas testified they had sex after the tests,
Quintana has tested negative for the AIDS virus.
   Dr. Edward G. Merritt, the former family physician, was also
accused of failing to diagnose the virus and not recommending
precautions but was found not liable.
   The couple's lawsuit named the blood bank, Kearns and Merritt.
The Quintanas did not sue Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez,
where Mrs. Quintana received the transfusion.
   In closing arguments, Witt said the blood bank was negligent for
failing to properly screen donors and test its blood supply.
   She said testing routinely used at the time to detect the
hepatitis-B virus in blood could have been useful in eliminating
homosexual blood donors, who are at high risk for that disease as
well as AIDS.
   Douglas Irish, an attorney for the blood bank, said tests for
AIDS in blood were not available until two years after Mrs.
Quintana's transfusion.
   Labensky said his client felt ``what they were doing was
reasonably prudent at the time, and apparently the jurors agreed.''
   Jurors said they had difficulty deciding what AIDS screening
standards were at the time and whether the blood bank lived up to
them.
   ``Three of us felt they met the industry's requirements, and
three did not,'' said foreman Albert Gonzales. ``I was surprised we
came up with an answer.
   ``While there was tremendous sympathy for Mrs. Quintana and her
family, we had to set that aside and look at the evidence.''
   AIDS breaks down the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   Jiang Qing, the widow of Chinese leader Mao
Tse-tung who played a key role in China's Cultural Revolution, has
throat cancer but is refusing a treatment that would leave her
voiceless, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported today.
   Jiang Qing, 74, is receiving treatment for the cancer at a
Beijing tumor hospital and was told by doctors she needed an
operation, the Chinese-language Wen Wei Po said in a front page
article that did not cite sources.
   But she refused the operation because she no longer would be
able to talk, the report said.
   Jiang was a member of the notorious ``Gang of Four,'' who were
accused of ordering illegal arrests during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution and trying to seize total power after Mao died in 1976.
   They and six other Cultural Revolution leaders were convicted in
1981 after a lengthy show trial. Jiang was initially sentenced to
death but the sentence was later changed to life in prison.
   Chinese officials earlier this year said Jiang was under
treatment in prison for an unspecified ``geriatric disease.'' But
the Wen Wei Po story said she received permission to be treated in
the hospital.
   The newspaper also reported that Chen Boda, formerly a close
aide to Mao and one of the fallen power-brokers of the Cultural
Revolution, was at the tumor hospital being treated for cancer.
   Officials earlier confirmed that Chen, 83, one of the most
fervent and hated persecutors of alleged rightists during the
Cultural Revolution, had been released on bail for medical
treatment. He was serving an 18-year term.

<HEAD>U.S. Arms Adviser Says START Treaty Will Be Difficult</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading U.S. arms official said today that it
is still ``theoretically possible'' for the superpowers to reach an
accord on long-range nuclear weapons before President Reagan leaves
office.
   However, Edward Rowny, who serves as special adviser to the
president and secretary of state on arms control, said serious
obstacles remain.
   ``If the Soviets were to work as hard and as fast as they worked
the last couple days in Moscow, yes, we could have a treaty,''
Rowny said at a news conference. ``It remains to be seen whether
they will show that much interest.''
   Rowny came to Beijing to brief Chinese officials on the
just-ended Moscow summit Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
Reagan, whose term ends this year.
   ``I don't want to say there couldn't be a START (strategic, or
long-range, nuclear arms) agreement. I'm also saying it's extremely
difficult and many, many difficult issues remain,'' he said.
   Among those issues are verification of air- and sea-launched
cruise missiles and mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles as
well as differences over Reagan's so-called Star Wars plan to put
defensive weapons in space, he said.
   Rowny said Washington ``recognizes China's support'' in bringing
about the just-signed Soviet-U.S. treaty to abolish
intermediate-range missiles. He declined to characterize his
meetings today with Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen and other
Chinese officials, saying only, ``I get good questions and good
support from the Chinese.''
   The official Chinese media has been mildly critical of the
fourth Reagan-Gorbachev summit, particularly on the issue of
disarmament.
   ``This summit had few concrete achievements to its credit,'' the
official China Daily said today in an editorial.
   The people of the world, it said, are happy to see U.S.-Soviet
dialogue but ``are far from satisfied when it (the summit) ended
without a breakthrough in the talks on a treaty cutting by half the
strategic offensive nuclear arsenals of both superpowers, which the
summit was previously intended for.''
   Rowny said, ``We believe we have done all that the traffic will
bear'' on strategic disarmament for now.
   He also expressed concern that momentum on arms control will be
lost as Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders prepare for a major
Communist Party meeting in the coming weeks.
   ``He'll be distracted and others will be distracted,'' he said.

   A teen-ager was killed and at least eight other
classmates were injured when a car hurdled a curb and plowed into
them, leaving bloodied bodies and school papers on the ground.
   ``Everybody was screaming, running around. Nobody knew what to
do,'' sixth-grader LaKeisha Alexander said after the accident
Friday afternoon.
   Two witnesses said they heard the driver tell police the
children had thrown a bottle at his car. Police Sgt. Martin Joseph
said he could not confirm the report.
   Six students with various injuries were in fair condition today
at two hospitals, officials said. Two who were less seriously hurt
said they would seek private treatment.
   The driver, Johnnie Person, 66, was being held in a police jail,
and was to be arraigned today said Officer Eric Gensley. No charges
had been filed, Gensley said.
   The accident occurred around 2:30 p.m. Friday two blocks from
Rosa Parks Middle School as students 11 to 14 years old walked home
from the school.
   ``I just saw a car going crazy and didn't know whether to run
like the guys that got hit or what,'' said Kevin Washington, 12.
``So I just stood there. He started coming at me but, lucky for me,
he curved at the last second.''
   After the late-model Cadillac hit the students, it struck a
parked car and came to rest by a fire hydrant, Joseph said.
   Police arrived three minutes later, said Principal Raymond
Demeulemeester, who had been following the children home.
   ``The scene was chaotic,'' Joseph said. ``There were injured
students laying on the grass and there were adults and children
trying to help.'' Bloodstained school papers were scattered on the
sidewalk.
   Ernest Powell, 14, died shortly after arriving at St. John
Hospital, hospital spokeswoman Dorothy Colombo said.
   Demetrius Garrett, 13, who witnessed the accident, said he
overheard the driver's conversation with police. ``He said they
threw a bottle at his car, so he drove up on the curb and started
hitting kids,'' Demetrius said.
   Rose Robertson, a nurse at Henry Ford Hospital who helped
injured students at the scene, also said she heard the driver tell
police the students threw a bottle at his car.

<HEAD>27 Miners Feared Dead In Tunnel Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DIPOLOG, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 27 gold miners were
believed killed when mine tunnels crudely dug on a remote
mountainside caved in after a heavy rain, a local official said
today.
   One miner was rescued by fellow workers shortly after the
accident occurred Friday night but his left leg was so badly
injured that doctors had to amputate it when he arrived at a
hospital here today, the official said.
   Benito Tolentino, mayor of the municipality of Sibutad where the
cave-in occurred, told reporters that a lack of equipment was
hampering rescue efforts on Mount Lablab, 30 miles from here and
450 miles southeast of Manila.
   Tolentino, who accompanied the unidentified survivor to report
the accident, said rescuers were armed only with picks and shovels
and were having difficulty reaching the trapped miners.
   He said there was little hope that any of them was still alive.
   Tolentino said 28 people were working in a network of tunnels
below a 45-foot-deep shaft when the surface caved in after two days
of heavy rain. He said he has ordered a temporary halt to any more
gold prospecting at the site.
   About 20,000 prospectors from different parts of Mindanao island
have converged on this area since gold was discovered there last
September, Tolentino said. He added that at least 12 people had
been killed in previous cave-ins.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in similar accidents
throughout Mindanao over the years.
   Armed only with picks and shovels, the miners often work without
any professional supervision. Some of the men burrow into
mountainsides while others use wooden pans to wash dirt away from
gold nuggets or dust in streams.

<HEAD>R.I. House Passes Bill To Require AIDS Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rhode Island House passed a sweeping
bill requiring the AIDS virus test for all prison inmates and for
marriage license applicants, hospital patients and others unless
they sign a waiver.
   ``I think it's something everyone can live with,'' Rep. Anthony
Carnevale Jr., Democratic chairman of the House Health, Education
and Welfare Committee, said following the action Friday.
   The measure was expected to receive Senate approval. It closely
resembles a bill originally proposed by Republican Gov. Edward D.
DiPrete, and he said he would sign it.
   The bill would require the test for the virus that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome for prison inmates and people
convicted of prostitution and intravenous drug use.
   It requires that marriage license applicants, hospital patients
and clients of family planning and sexually transmitted disease
clinics be tested unless they sign a waiver.
   The bill contains language to prevent discrimination against
those who carry, or are perceived to carry, the virus. It requires
health care providers to report the names of those testing positive
to the state Department of Health.
   ``Rhode Island has been a national leader on the AIDS problem,''
DiPrete said. ``I think you'll soon find other states following our
leadership.''
   As of Jan 1., Illinois has required marriage license applicants
to take the test.
   The House also approved two of five proposed amendments. The
bill was expanded to include testing for disability insurance
applicants, and a provision was dropped that would have seen the
measure expire July 1, 1990, if insurance companies had not
established a high-risk insurance pool for those who test positive
by then.
   ``If the insurers don't want to come through the way they say
they will, you will already be back in session'' and can deal with
it then, Carnevale told the House.
   Legislators tabled an amendment to require physicians only to
inform marriage applicants of the hazards of AIDS and the
availability of tests.
   Rep. Nicholas Tsiongas pleaded passionately for dropping the
requirement that the names of those testing positive be reported to
authorities.
   The Democrat, who is the Legislature's only physician, said a
central registry would deter those in high-risk groups from being
tested. The House rejected his amendment.
   The House also defeated an amendment to remove
anti-discrimination language.
   ``This is a health care bill and not one that emphasizes civil
rights,'' said Rep. Bradford Gorham, the amendment's Republican
sponsor. ``What we're doing is saying people with AIDS have all
sorts of rights that those people with other deadly diseases''
don't, he argued.
   Carnevale disagreed. ``It's the heart of the bill. You can't
tell someone to be tested without giving them protection.''
   Rep. Ray Rickman, a Democrat who voted against the bill, said it
would waste enormous sums of money testing people not at high risk.

<HEAD>Government Agrees To Base Planes From Spain In Italy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 7 grafs with details of decision.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Italian government today agreed to accept the
U.S. F-16 fighter planes being evicted from Spain, a cabinet
minister announced.
   The decision, which had been expected, followed a formal request
from NATO to transfer the 72 nuclear-capable jet fighters to Italy.
   The planes, which make up the U.S. Air Force's 401st Tactical
Fighter Wing, are now based at Torrejon air base near Madrid. Spain
has said they must be withdrawn within three years.
   Remo Gaspari, a Christian Democrat minister, announced the
decision to reporters while the Cabinet meeting led by Premier
Ciriaco De Mita was still under way.
   ``We have taken the decision naturally hoping it will be like
the missiles in Comiso,'' Gaspari said.
   Comiso is the Sicilian base where U.S. cruise missiles were
installed as part of NATO's response to a Soviet missile buildup.
The missiles will now be removed from Comiso under the U.S.-Soviet
treaty on medium-range nuclear missiles.
   There was no immediate announcement on where in Italy the planes
will be based.
   Italian government officials have said the transfering of the
F-16s would be examined by Parliament but that a vote would likely
not be needed.
   The Communists, Italy's second largest party, are opposed to the
transfer. But De Mita's coalition of his Christian Democrats
together with Socialists, Republicans, Social Democrats and
Liberals has a comfortable majority in both houses.
   NATO's defense ministers made the formal request to Italy during
a meeting in Brussels on May 26.
   Lord Carrington, secretary general of the Western alliance, said
then that the planes represent ``a considerable portion of our
strength in the southern region.''

   An opposition leader accused the
government today of holding him and six other political activists
on false charges and demanded freedom for other political prisoners
in Malaysia.
   ``We have been detained under trumped-up charges,'' said Tan
Seng Giaw, vice chairman of the opposition Democratic Action Party
who was released Friday after spending more than six months in jail.
   Another opposition leader, also released, said he was looking
forward to getting back to politics and union work and that the
prison experience had left him unbowed.
   ``I want the Prime Minister to release all those who were
arrested with me and are being held under the ISA,'' Tan said
during the conference held at the party's national headquarters.
   Tan was referring to Malaysia's Internal Security Act which
allows imprisonment without trial for activities which challenge
the Malaysian government. Under the act, individuals may be
imprisoned indefinitely with a board reviewing the detention every
six months.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad later told reporters the
government does not intend to detain forever those arrested under
the ISA.
   ``We are not keeping them forever. It depends on them,'' he said
when commenting on Friday's release. Mahathir said the prisoners
would get a fair review in front of the appeal board.
   The bespectacled Tan, stroking a goatie beard grown while he was
in the Kamunting Prison near Ipoh, said he had not been subjected
to physical torture.
   Tan came to the press conference directly from the prison, 120
miles north of here.
   The six others released Friday included opposition figures, a
Christian social worker, a university lecturer and Chinese
educators.
   Tan said the conditions for his release restrict him to his home
at night, and he must tell police when he plans to leave the Kuala
Lumpur area.
   The acting secretary general of Tan's party, Lee Lam Thye, said
the party launched a signature campaign to urge the prime minister
to release the remaining detainees.
   A total of 109 people were detained during a two-month period
beginning last October. Tan was jailed on Nov. 2, 1987.
   Prime Minister Mohamad Mahathir has maintained the detentions
were necessary because the individuals contributed to racial
tension and their arrests were needed to prevent Malay-Chinese
racial clashes.
   On Oct. 28 last year, the government also banned the
English-language Star daily, the Chinese-language Sin Chew Jit Poh
daily, and the Malay bi-weekly Watan for fanning racial tension.
   Tan said that while in jail the detainees were allowed to
exercise and read, but newspapers and magazines were censored
before delivery.
   Asked if he was interrogated, Tan replied, ``What is there to
interrogate?'' He said he had not advocated violence and that he
was not a subversive.
   Tan added the detention has not changed his views in any way and
he was determined to continue his fight for ``a better country for
all''.
   The 46-year-old physician was joined by his wife and two
daughters after the conference.
   Democratic Action Party parliamentarian and Central Committee
Member Vethamuthu David, who was also released, said detention was
difficult but that it failed to change his political views.
   David at a press conference at his residence today said he was
looking forward to going back to his political and union work
   David is Secretary General of the Malaysian Trades Union
Congress and General Secretary of the Transport Workers Union. He
denied he had fanned racial tensions.

   A two-year-old boy who was
abducted 17 months ago in Thailand for sale on the baby black
market has been reunited with his mother in Malaysia.
   The joy of meeting with her baby was reflected on Sompis
Kleepjampee's face at the Tengku Ampuan Fatimah Children's Home in
Kuantan on Friday.
   Sompis, 32, lost her youngest child, Nui Kleepjampee, in
February 1987 in Prakanong, Bangkok, the National News Agency
Bernama reported from Kuantan.
   Sompis told reporters through an interpreter that her son was
kidnapped by an old woman who had offered her a job. The baby was
then sold to a ring that markets babies for adoption.
   Sompis said the woman came to her house in Prakanong, Thailand,
and offered her a job because the woman said she felt pity for her
after learning that her husband had left her and that she supported
four children, including Nui.
   She said the woman later took her to a beauty salon and carried
Nui, who was then nine months old.
   The woman ran off with the baby while she was shampooing her
hair in the salon, she said.
   Today, a court ruled that Sompis could take the child home to
Thailand.
   Sompis, shed tears of joy, soon after magistrate Mrs. Mariana
Yahya, gave the order in Kuantan, 120 miles east of the capital,
the national news agency Bernama reported.
   Nui was among five Thai children who were rescued and placed in
the children's home under protection of the Welfare Services
Ministry after they were kidnapped and sold in Malaysia by a
criminal syndicate.
   Thai police and Malaysian authorities found Nui and three other
babies in Mentakab, Malaysia, and the fifth one was found nearby in
Jerantut earlier this year.
   The baby found in Jerantut was reunited with its mother in the
home in February. Santi Isrowuthakul, a staff member of the Center
for the Protection of Children's Rights in Bangkok, said his
organization was still trying to contact families of the other
three Thai babies.
   He said the syndicate that was involved in kidnapping the five
babies had been smashed after the March arrest of a 72-year-old
woman in Thailand.

   ``A strong blow was struck against criminal organizations that

   The arrests were carried out Friday in Naples, Rome, Milan,

   Thunderstorms produced severe weather Friday afternoon across
parts of Texas, Louisiana and South Carolina, but weakened during
the evening hours.
   The storm system hitting the northern Rockies produced wind
gusts to 60 mph at Conrad Airport in northwestern Montana on Friday
evening, but those thunderstorms also dissipated.
   Early this morning, showers and thunderstorms were scattered
across eastern Texas, southern Arkansas and western Louisiana.
Showers and thunderstorms also dotted the coast of the Carolinas

Gulf Coast from southeast Texas into northern and central Florida;
numerous thunderstorms across southeast Texas and southern
Louisiana; showers and a few thunderstorms across the Pacific
Northwest; and mostly cloudy skies across southern New England.
Elsewhere, mostly sunny skies were expected.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation; in the 70s from the Great Lakes region through the
lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys into Arkansas and the Carolinas;
in the 60s from the central Appalachians and upper Ohio Valley into
New England; in the 60s and 70s from the Pacific Northwest into the
northern half of California; and 100 to 110 in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Notes At Issue In Mecham Trial</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutors in former Gov. Evan
Mecham's criminal trial asked that the jury be allowed to see a set
of notes once considered a ``smoking gun'' in the charge he
concealed a $300,000 campaign loan.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan said Friday he
would rule before the trial resumes Monday on whether to allow
testimony on the three pages of notes by Vern Gasser, a former
member of the Mecham Finance Committee.
   Meanwhile, former U.S. Rep. Sam Steiger, who was convicted of
pressuring a parole board member while working as a gubernatorial
aide to Mecham, was sentenced Friday to four years probation, a
$5,480 fine and 700 hours of community service.
   Steiger, 59, was convicted April 7 of theft by extortion in
threatening Board of Pardons and Paroles member Ron Johnson over a
personnel vote.
   Mecham and his brother, Willard, are charged with concealing the
$350,000 loan from Tempe developer Barry Wolfson. Willard Mecham
was his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer.
   The notes, which Gasser took during a finance committee meeting
in fall 1986, were considered a ``smoking gun'' against Mecham
during January's House impeachment hearings. The notes say, ``show
Evan borrowed money'' and ``don't show borrowed money.''
   However, Gasser said in court Friday he could not recall who
made the statements or who attended the meeting.
   In arguments with the jury absent, Willard Mecham's lawyer, Joe
Keilp, said the notes and testimony should not be admitted. Keilp
said he feared there would be implications that Willard Mecham may
have made the statements Gasser's notes referred to.
   Prosecutor Barnett Lotstein said the notes should be admitted
because they referred to a meeting involving Mecham campaign
strategists.
   Earlier Friday, Ryan rejected a motion for a mistrial by the
defense, which contended the prosecution presented improper
evidence implying wrongdoing in the handling of the Mecham
campaign's checkbook.
   The judge said he thought the testimony Thursday from a state
handwriting expert was ``quite innocuous'' and may prove relevant
regarding Willard Mecham's bookkeeping practices.
   Handwriting expert William Flynn had testified there had been a
number of ``whiteouts, erasures and alterations'' in the checkbook.
He did not speculate on the reasons for the changes.
   The Mecham brothers sat with their attorneys and declined to
talk to reporters.
   Jurors were read parts of Willard Mecham's January testimony to
the state grand jury in which he denied wrongdoing when he lumped
the $350,000 loan into a $465,000 total listed on financial reports
as a contribution from Evan Mecham.
   ``I felt he (Evan Mecham) would eventually be responsible for
paying it back,'' Willard Mecham told the grand jury. ``I didn't
feel I was doing anything wrong at the time and certainly didn't
feel I was violating the law.''
   The transcript also showed Willard Mecham said he did not know
until after the loan's existence was diclosed by the news media
about a letter in which his brother promised Wolfson the loan would
remain confidential.
   Willard Mecham testified at the time that he was told by the
secretary of state's office that similar amounts could be lumped
together, but he did not ask whether amounts from different sources
could be combined.
   If convicted on all six counts of perjury, willful concealment
and filing false documents, Evan Mecham faces up to 22 years in
prison. Willard Mecham faces three similar counts and up to 9{
years in prison if convicted.
   The first-term Republican governor was removed from office April
4 when the state Senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment
counts.

   A radical protester tried to burn
himself to death and four student leaders were arrested at a U.S.
Army base today as the government ordered a crackdown on violent
unrest.
   A student identified as Park Rae-chun, 24, doused himself with
inflammable liquid and ignited it in an anti-government protest at
Soongshil University in southern Seoul.
   ``Overthrow military fascists,'' Park shouted before setting
himself afire. Hospital officials said he was in critical condition.
   Two other radical students have killed themselves in the past
month as part of anti-government protests. Ritual suicide is a
traditional form of protest to try to shame the government.
   Four radical student leaders were arrested at U.S. Army
headquarters in Seoul after they tried to force their way through
its main gate. The students, who were seized by South Korean
police, wanted to see U.S. Army commander Gen. Louis Menetrey to
demand permission to march to the North Korean border.
   Radical students plan to march to the Communist North Korean
border June 10 to try to force reunification of the divided Korean
peninsula. A U.S. Army spokesman said that only the South Korean
government can grant permission for civilians to visit the border
and that it was a purely domestic matter.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae warned in a nationally
televised speech that the government would not tolerate violent
protests by radical students and striking workers. He said the
government was determined to maintain law and order.
   ``The government will sternly deal with all violent acts,'' he
said.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent
weeks with students demonstrating against the government and the
United States. In addition, striking factory workers have been
seeking pay hikes.
   Authorities said students attacked two police stations in the
southern city of Kwangju with firebombs before dawn today and
caused minor damage. No arrests or injuries were reported.
   Lee accused radical students who plan to march to the border
June 10 of being pro-North Korean and threatening the safety of
South Korea. The pro-Western south and the totalitarian north are
bitter enemies who often clash.
   ``North Korea has been strengthening its stance ... apparently
encouraged by South Korean students,'' Lee said.
   Radical students plan to march June 10 to the border truce site
of Panmunjom to meet with North Korean students and reunite the two
nations.
   Unification of the two Koreas, divided since 1945, is a highly
emotional issue for many Koreans, and radicals have been attempting
to use it to gain support. Most people in the south are distrustful
of the north, which invaded the south in 1950 and started the
Korean War.
   The prime minister said the government agreed free discussion of
reunification was necessary, even though authorities limited the
issue in the past.
   Students elected 13 representatives at a meeting today at Yonsei
University in Seoul to take part in the proposed talks with North
Korean students. Some students yelled ``Yankee go home'' and
``Unite the fatherland.''
   Four student leaders then went to the U.S. Army headquarters to
demand they be allowed to go to the border next week. The Panmunjom
truce site is under U.S. military control.
   The four were seized by police as soon as they arrived at the
U.S. base. A U.S. officer briefly met with one of the leaders
before they were taken away by police as they yelled anti-U.S.
slogans.
   Police repeated warnings today that students would not be
allowed to march to the border and said anyone doing so would be
arrested. The heavily militarized border 30 miles north of Seoul is
off limits to civilians.
   Radical students have been pushing for reunification with the
north, claiming that the United States enforces the division so it
can rule the south as a colony. The students demand expulsion of
42,000 U.S. troops based in the south under a defense treaty.

<HEAD>Not All Reformers Elected As Moscow Delegates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with list of delegates showing some reformers
not going to conference, no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Party leaders in the capital restored the names of
many reformers to ballots for a key Communist conference over
conservative objections, but a list published today showed some
reformers lost election.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and five other members of the ruling
Politburo, including KGB chairman Viktor M. Chebrikov and Kremlin
No. 2 Yegor K. Ligachev, were among 319 delegates elected after
what media accounts described as sharp debates at a Moscow party
meeting to name delegates on Friday.
   The delegate battle has been the talk of Moscow for days as the
state-run media and even political street protests, unusual for the
Soviet Union, brought the internal party battle over reform into
the open.
   Late Friday, the state-run media reported that the Moscow party
hierarchy had restored the names of prominent intellectual
reformers who had been axed from the delegate list in initial
politicking at precinct level.
   But a final list of the 319 Moscow delegates published today in
Moscow's Communist Party daily Moskovskaya Pravda showed that key
reformers such as sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, playwright
Mikhail Shatrov and economist Nikolai Shmelev had not won election
in secret ballots.
   Filmmaker Elem Klimov and economist Leonid Abalkin _ other
liberals who were restored _ were named as delegates, however.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of the pro-reform weekly Ogonyok, was
one Moscow-based reformers eased off the delegate list in Moscow,
but state-run media now say the Ukrainian-born writer will be a
delegate for Kherson, a Ukrainian port city on the Black Sea.
   It was not clear whether other reformers would be named
delegates from other regions of the vast nation.
   The openness of the battle in Moscow and the restoration of
reformers to the delegate list by the city party hierarchy could
affect similar battles reported by state-run media to be going on
across the country.
   With close to 1 million members, many of them the nation's
leading intellectuals and officials, the Moscow Communist party is
the nation's largest, most prestigious and influential party body.
   Gorbachev himself attended the meeting of Moscow party leaders
Friday that named the final delegate list after weeks of discussion
over who attends the conference, due to open June 28. It will be
the first of its kind since 1941.
   Moskovskaya Pravda printed only a summary of his remarks and did
not make clear whether Gorbachev had spoken in favor of the
restored candidacies or scolded party conservatives for attempting
to ease out reformers.
   Other Politburo members named as delegates are President Andrei
A. Gromyko, Moscow party boss Lev N. Zaikov and Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov.
   Defense Minister Dmitri A. Yazov, a candidate or non-voting
Politburo member, was also among those named as delegates.
   Other Politburo members are likely to be elected from other
parts of the country. Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, for
instance, has his Communist Party base in the southern republic of
Georgia.
   One name not on the list of delegates was that of Boris N.
Yeltsin, the former Moscow party boss ousted in November after
making a still unpublished speech to the Central Committee in which
he is said to have fiercely criticized the pace of reform.
   On Monday, Yeltsin took the unprecedented step of using Western
television interviews to call for the resignation of Ligachev on
grounds he is is blocking more reform.
   At an unprecedented Moscow news conference on Wednesday,
Gorbachev denied there was any question of Ligachev's removal but
skirted mention of the party conference and the delegate battle.
   Ligachev has often appeared to be more cautious about reform
than Gorbachev and is widely rumored to head a conservative faction
in the party.
   There are expected to be about 5,000 delegates to the
conference, which will consider a document published eight days ago
outlining potentially radical reforms to introduce political
accountability into the Soviet Union's one-party system.
   It is felt that the reforms, most of which are vaguely outlined
in the document, could be in jeopardy if conservatives dominate the
conference hall.
   Ms. Zaslavskaya and other reformers noted in the pre-conference
maneuvering that it would be even more important which of the
delegates gets the privilege of speaking at the party conference,
whose duration is so far uncertain.
   The Moskovskaya Pravda list showed that the delegates
represented all walks of Soviet life: the military, science, the
arts, economists, industrial managers and workers.

   Government troops killed
eight communist rebels in two encounters with them on the southern

   Col. Rogelio Villanueva of the Philippine Army's 4th Infantry
Division said troops intercepted a group of 20 rebels fleeing
another military operation in Agusan del Norte province on Friday
and killed five of them.
   He said two government militiamen were wounded in the 35-minute
battle near the town of Buenavista, 60 miles from here and 500
miles southeast of Manila.
   In Misamis Oriental province, three guerrillas were killed in a
skirmish Friday that began when soldiers on patrol caught five
rebels collecting ``taxes'' in Lagonglong, a military report said.
One soldier was wounded in the clash, it added.
   Rebels frequently extort cash payments from peasants.

<TEXT>
   A bank robber's getaway was foiled by a car
wreck, a former policeman who shot him twice and a witness who ran
him down with a station wagon, and the man died hours later, police
said.
   John Thomas Barthelemy, 28, died late Friday at St. Joseph's
Hospital of wounds to the side of the neck and the abdomen. Alleged
accomplice Dianna Sue Cardiff, who is pregnant, was in stable
condition at Tampa General Hospital.
   Police said both were shot by Dr. Robert Dinsmore, a
chiropractor and former Tampa policeman, who saw the mid-afternoon
holdup at a Southeast Bank branch and pursued the robbers in his
car.
   A mile from the bank, at an intersection in a subdivision, the
suspects ran a stop sign and their car collided with two others.
   Dinsmore stopped his car and got out holding a gun. Barthelemy
was wielding a gun when he and Ms. Cardiff jumped out of the
getaway car, and a shootout began at close range, police said.
   A fourth person, whose car had collided with the robbers' sports
car, also pulled out a gun and fired one shot, but he wasn't hurt.
The driver of the other car involved in the wreck ``stayed in his
car and stayed out of the way,'' Lt. Jesse James said.
   ``Bullets were flying everywhere,'' James said. He said Dinsmore
and Barthelemy each fired several shots.
   Dinsmore was shot once in the shoulder and hospitalized in
stable condition. Lt. T.A. Ressler said it's doubtful he will be
charged.
   ``He apparently was acting within the law at the time to
apprehend a felon violator,'' Ressler said.
   Ms. Cardiff, 21, who lived with Barthelemy in Tampa, was charged
with attempted first-degree murder and armed robbery with a
firearm. Police said Barthelemy robbed the bank at gunpoint and
took a bag full of money, while Ms. Cardiff drove the getaway car.
   After the shootout, Barthelemy and Ms. Cardiff ran down the
street, and a witness pursued in a station wagon. Barthelemy
pointed his gun at the witness, who reacted by hitting the suspect
with the car. Barthelemy then dropped his gun and the money.
   Police found the robbers a short time later hiding behind bushes
about 60 yards from the site of the shootout. They were captured
without further incident and taken to separate hospitals.
   The bank's money was recovered, but Sgt. R.J. Reynolds said
police hadn't determined the total.

   Country music singer Barbara Mandrell
used ringers to win a come-from-behind victory over a team led by
Bob Hope in the Barbara Mandrell Celebrity Softball Classic.
   A host of celebrities including talk show host Oprah Winfrey,
entertainer Dick Clark, rock musician Meat Loaf and rap musician
L.L. Cool J turned out for the 18-17 victory Friday by Mandrell's
AT&T Ringers over Hope's Pepsi Challengers.
   Before the game, Hope was anything but pessimistic.
   ``Pay no attention to Barbara's team,'' the comedian said.
``We're gonna kill 'em. We're gonna win, even if we have to cheat.''
   Mandrell literally got a lift from former Pittsburgh Steelers
great Lynn Swann during one of her trips to the plate. Swann
hoisted the petite singer parallel to the ground, and began
swinging his new ``bat.''
   In the second inning, John Stamos, the heartthrob of the ``Full
House'' television show, strutted to the plate and made two strikes
before grounding to Ron Perlman, star of the ``Beauty and the
Beast.'' TV show. Stamos joked he ``was a lover not an athlete.''
   ``I'll be the judge of that,'' said pop star Sheena Easton.
   Proceeds from the game went to the Vanderbilt University Medical
Center transplant program.

<TEXT>
   George Mickelson was 7 when he watched his
father, the governor, help sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski dynamite the
first rock from a rugged Black Hills mountain that the artist
wanted to shape into a likeness of Sioux Indian leader Crazy Horse.
   Mickelson, now governor himself, planned to help Ziolkowski's
widow set off another explosion today to mark the 40th anniversary
of the start of that project, which is still under way in western
South Dakota.
   Mickelson said his return to Crazy Horse Memorial, about 10
miles west of Mount Rushmore National Memorial, would follow the
Indian theme that life moves in circles.
   ``We've now come full circle,'' Mickelson said. ``It's something
I've kind of grown up with. It's special to me.''
   Ziolkowski died in 1982 at age 74. His wife, Ruth, and eight of
their 10 children have continued to blast and carve Thunderhead
Mountain.
   Mickelson said he remembers that at the time of the first blast,
many people were skeptical whether the project would be completed.
He said that over the years he's seen the dedication of Ziolkowski
and his family keep the dream alive as rock has been steadily
removed from the mountain.
   The project not only draws more than 1 million tourists a year
to help the Black Hills economy, but also helps improve relations
between Indians and non-Indians, the governor said.
   ``We tend to focus too much on our differences, when in fact
this gives us an opportunity to give a prominent role to a great
Indian leader,'' Mickelson said.
   Crazy Horse helped lead the Indians who defeated Gen. George
Custer at the 1876 battle of the Little Big Horn in Montana. But
after he and 1,000 starving followers were forced to surrender, he
was killed by a soldier's bayonet in prison in 1877 at an estimated
age of 34.
   Five Indians who fought with Crazy Horse at Little Big Horn
attended the first blast on the mountain.
   When completed, a statue 563 feet tall and 641 feet long will
show Crazy Horse astride a horse and pointing east to the Plains.
The statue will be so large that all four president's heads on
Mount Rushmore would fit inside Crazy Horse's head, and a 10-story
building could stand in the opening between the horse's back and
the Indian's outstretched arm.
   Ziolkowski said the statue would depict Crazy Horse's answer to
a white man who asked what had become of his lands. Crazy Horse
pointed over his horse's head and replied, ``My lands are where my
dead lie buried.''
   Ziolkowski, an acclaimed self-taught sculptor born in Boston,
worked briefly at Mount Rushmore, but didn't get along with chief
sculptor Gutzon Borglum.
   Then some Sioux leaders asked Ziolkowski to create a monument.
``My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red
man had great heroes, too,'' wrote Chief Henry Standing Bear.
   Unlike Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse is being carved in the round
so it can be viewed from all sides.
   And also unlike Rushmore, Ziolkowski's dream is financed
strictly by private donations and entrance fees. The mountain was
purchased from the federal government and is owned by Crazy Horse
Memorial Foundation.
   About 8.2 million tons of rock have been removed from the
mountain, which can be worked only in the summer, and it is
beginning to take on the rough form of Ziolkowski's dream.
   Family members say they don't know how long the project will
take.
   ``It's 40 years. We started with absolutely nothing. If it
hadn't been for Korczak, nobody would have started it,'' Mrs.
Ziolkowski said. ``As Korczak said, `It isn't how fast you go, it's
that you do it right and you never stop working.'''

   The group watched the meeting this week between Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Lowery, an Atlanta minister, told
a news conference Friday.
   ``We observed with appreciation the president's emphasis on
human rights in the Soviet Union, with particular concern for the
right of dissent and freedom of religion,'' Lowery said.
   Lowery said the group wants to meet with Reagan, Vice President
George Bush and Secretary of State George Shultz to ``assist the
president in developing and shaping our nation's policies in
opposing apartheid and calling for protection of human rights in
South Africa.''
   Apartheid is South Africa's system of racial segregation.
   Joining Lowery were the Rev. Patricia McClurg of the National
Council of Churches, Rabbi Alvin Sugarman of Reformed Judaism and
several area ministers.

<TEXT>
   Thurman Z. Luke wore denim overalls and
lived in what some considered a modest house, but when the
75-year-old died he left a $275,000 estate to the U.S. Treasury.
   Luke, who died at his Baxter home in east Tennessee last March,
directed in his will that all his property be sold and the proceeds
be given to the Treasury to help pay off the national debt.
   The property included four money-market certificates in
Cookeville banks worth $215,000, a checking account with an $18,299
balance and a home worth $25,000.
   Also included in the will dated December 1983 were various
household furnishings.
   The document was filed in Cookeville's Probate Court and
attorney Don Dickerson was appointed as executor. Luke's two living
brothers and sisters signed waivers declining administration of the
will.
   ``I have never been married, and so I have no natural object of
affection to whom to pass my estate,'' Luke said in the will.
   Luke grew up in Appalachia and like many farm boys traveled to
Michigan in the 1940s, when the auto industry thrived. He served in
World War II and saved his Army paychecks, accumulating $17,000 by
the time he left the military.
   He pre-arranged his burial, and requested that no public
announcement be made at the time of his death.
   His only other request was that his rank in the military _
corporal _ be included on his tombstone.
   Friends said he frequently talked about the problems of the
government and liked to discuss politics.
   ``I would call him one of those natural-born `agitators' _ a
person that just delighted in arguing some issue,'' said his first
cousin, Billy Luke of Cookeville.
   ``You know, he just liked to take the other side, to argue. He
was sharp and very well read, especially on politics and history,
and he did worry about the government being in debt,'' he said.

   The House moved one step closer to funding for
the superconducting super collider, voting overwhelmingly to
approve a Department of Energy spending blueprint that includes
$1.6 billion for the project.
   The super collider, a massive high-energy physics project which
advocates say could lead to breakthroughs in understanding basic
matter, would be authorized $147 million in fiscal 1989 and $675
million and $774 million the following two years.
   There is no guarantee that the money would flow to developing
the superconductor following Friday's vote since actual spending is
controlled by separate appropriations legislation.
   The bill sent to the Senate on Friday by a 290-27 vote would
authorize continued spending on a wide variety of research and
development by the Department of Energy, including clean-coal
technology and alternative motor fuels.

   All 11 people in the plane were killed, the communique said.
   All of them were soldiers.
   Police at the scene said the plane crashed into a mountain three
miles from downtown Quito and tumbled into a small river.
   A spokesman for the Office of the Presidency, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, also confirmed the generals' deaths.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known.

   Three owners of Suzuki Samurais have filed a
class action contending the vehicles have design flaws that make
them unsafe.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Circuit Court against American
Suzuki Corp. of Brea, Calif., seeks full refunds as well as an
unspecified amount of damages for all Suzuki Samurai owners.
   The plaintiffs were identified in the lawsuit only as Steven and
Linda Newmark of Missouri and Lynn Romanek of Illinois.
   Citing an article in Consumer Reports magazine, attorneys for
the plaintiffs contend the Suzuki Samurai vehicles are unstable and
can roll over at speeds as low as 40 mph. The company has defended
the vehicles as safe.
   ``Basically, the suit contends Suzuki had the knowledge of the
problem but did not notify the owners or rectify it,'' said Aron
Robinson, an attorney for the law firm of Holstein, Mack & Dupree,
which is working on the suit.
   Suzuki offices in Brea were closed late Friday, and officials
could not be reached for comment on the lawsuit.
   However, Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of
American Suzuki, said, said earlier, in response to the Consumer
Reports article, ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling
a safe and stable vehicle.''
   The company said the Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the United
States in November 1985.

   About 300 passengers were delayed up to an hour
at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when an old artillery shell
a youngster had packed aboard a flight from Europe caused a bomb
scare.
   The shell, the size of two oil cans, was picked up from a
battlefield in France by a teen-ager. It dropped out of a bicycle
box being unloaded Friday from Scandinavian Airlines System Flight
937 from Copenhagen, Port of Seattle police Chief Ed Ingram said.
   The shell was reportedly of World War I vintage. It was exploded
late Friday by munitions experts at the Army's Fort Lewis, near
Tacoma. It wasn't clear whether the shell could have exploded on
its own.
   The teen-ager was on a trip arranged through the Bush School, a
private school in Seattle, said Kerri Lauman, the mother of one of
four students who returned Friday and were questioned about the
shell.
   The students, returning from a three-month tour of France, said
the boy who packed the shell in the box was still in Europe.
   The students who were questioned, three girls and Ms. Lauman's
son, David, knew the other student had found the shell, but thought
he had heeded advice not to try to send it home, Ms. Lauman said.
   The four were released after questioning, said airport
spokeswoman Margo Spellman.
   The shell was about a foot long and three inches in diameter,
Ms. Spellman said. It was placed in a steel drum, loaded on a truck
and taken to a concrete bomb bunker away from the terminal.
   Leif Eie, an SAS spokesman in Seattle, said transporting the
shell wasn't illegal because ``we permit live ammunition in the
baggage compartment like all other carriers.''

   A landslide smashed a shanty in a
Manila suburb, killing five people and bringing to seven the
official death toll in the wake of tropical typhoon Susan,
officials said today.
   The landslide occurred Friday in the Guadalupe district of
suburban Makati, where earth and rock loosened by heavy rain
cascaded onto a shanty at the foot of a hill, according to Crispina
Abat of the Office of Civil Defense.
   The other fatalities were a 9-year-old boy who drowned in floods
in the Manila suburb of San Juan and a 5-year-old boy crushed by a
landslide in Zambales province, 50 miles northwest of Manila, Mrs.
Abat said.
   In the central Philippine city of Cebu, the coast guard said 13
crewmen were missing after a 700-ton cargo ship carrying 40,000
cases of beer sank in rough seas Thursday. Four people, including a
10-year old boy, were rescued.
   The ship was en route from Cebu City to Legazpi when it sank off
Leyte island about 300 miles southeast of Manila, shipping
officials said. They said the ship went down between two small
islands and some of the missing crewmen may have been able to swim
to safety.
   Susan battered the northern Philippines as a tropical depression
earlier in the week and returned late Wednesday as a typhoon with
winds of up to 87 mph. Its accompanying heavy rains flooded wide
areas of Manila and Luzon island.
   Meanwhile, weathermen today were closely watching a tropical
depression brewing some 320 miles east of northern Luzon's eastern
coast. A weather bulletin said the depression had winds of about 35
mph.

   Arabs in the occupied territories ignored
appeals by the Israeli army and kept shops shuttered today for the
second day of a strike called by the underground Palestinian
leadership.
   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded a 55-year-old Palestinian
woman in a clash today in the occupied Gaza Strip, an Arab reporter
said. She was shot in the hand in the Nusseirat refugee camp when a
melee broke out as soldiers went to a school, said the reporter,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said soldiers severely beat a 15-year-old boy in the clash.
   A military spokesman said he was unaware of any disturbances in
Gaza or the West Bank. Israel army radio said the Nusseirat camp
and Bureij refugee camp, also in Gaza, were put under curfew.
   Stores were closed and buses and most cars stayed off the
streets in the territories. In Gaza City, at least 15 burning tires
were blocking main roads and troops fired tear gas to clear away
protesters, the Arab reporter.
   Leaders of the 6-month-old Arab uprising called the strike to
protest the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz to the
region to promote a peace initiative.
   Shultz arrived Friday in Cairo and was traveling to Jordan and
Syria today and Israel on Sunday.
   Major General Yitzhak Mordechai, who commands the Gaza area,
appealed to residents to maintain calm during today's anniversary
of Israel's invasion of Lebanon, promising aid and relief to those
who complied.
   On Friday, soldiers and unidentified civilians shot two
Palestinians to death and wounded at least five other West Bank
Arabs.
   Since the beginning of the uprising Dec. 8, 201 Palestinians and
two Israelis have died.
   An Israeli army officer shot and killed a 26-year-old Arab
Friday in Tzafa village near Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, after
unidentified Israeli civilians killed a 20-year-old man in Shuyukh
village near Hebron.
   The civilians also wounded three others in the incident,
hospital officials in Hebron and police said.
   ``Just before nightfall, a military patrol in the village was
surrounded and showered with rocks,'' an army spokesman said. ``An
officer shot first in the air, but when he was in danger for his
life, he shot at the people's legs, and the 26-year-old was
killed.''
   Israeli radio identified the dead man as Muhamad Ranen.
   In a separate incident Friday, troops shot and wounded two Arab
youths after they blocked roads with rocks and threw stones at an
army patrol in the market area of the West Bank city of Nablus.
   The army maintained curfews and movement restrictions on about
200,000 residents of the territories in order to squelch unrest.
   Police said they suspected a group of four Jewish youths may
have been involved in the killing of the Shuyukh man, identified as
Mustafa Ahmed Halaika.
   An army spokesman said no soldiers were in the area when the
shooting took place.
   As Shultz launched the fourth round of his peace mission, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated his staunch opposition to the
American plan to promote an international Middle East peace
conference.
   Shamir insists on direct bilateral talks between Israel and its
Arab neighbors.
   His political rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, said he was
optimistic about an international conference because of what he
said were encouraging changes in Soviet attitudes.
   A poll published Friday in the Hebrew daily Hadashot newspaper
indicates Peres' left-of-center Labor party has gained in
popularity in recent months and could win 53 parliament seats in
the November elections, up from 50 in March.
   Maj. Gen. Mordechai used the platform of Israeli television's
Arabic service to appeal to Gaza Strip residents to ignore today's
anniversary as well as the Sunday anniversary of the 1967 Six Day
War, when Israel captured the land.
   He promised to lift curfews and release prisoners if residents
returned to ``life, work, trade and school.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he would release 120
teen-age boys from prison Sunday as a gesture of goodwill.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Guarantee of Legal Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has affirmed the right
of death row inmates to legal aid in what lawyers say is the first
ruling of its kind in the nation, though most states already
guarantee such aid.
   ``Obviously we're very pleased,'' Richmond attorney Gerald
Zerkin said Friday. ``It resolves a very difficult situation in
which men on death row did not have access to counsel to challenge
their death sentences.''
   The ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a
1986 decision by U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. That
decision had been overturned last year by a three-judge panel of
the appeals court.
   Friday's 6-4 ruling means that Virginia will have to provide
legal counsel for death row inmates who request representation for
their appeals, Zerkin said. He said the specifics of how
representation will be provided remain to be worked out.
   Jonathan Sasser, a Durham, N.C., attorney involved in the case,
said the ruling gives impoverished death row prisoners access to
the courts.
   ``For a death row inmate in Virginia, it means you have to have
a living breathing attorney to represent you,'' he said from his
Durham office.
   Virginia law provides no guarantee of legal assistance once an
inmate's sentence has been affirmed by the state Supreme Court.
   The 11-page ruling is ``the first decision of its kind,'' Zerkin
said, but he added that it is ``grounded in the particular facts of
Virginia's death row.
   ``Many, I would say most, states already provide representation
without having been required to do so,'' Zerkin said.
   The case was brought to federal court in 1986 by death row
inmate Joseph Giarratano, who was disturbed by the case of Earl
Washington, another death row inmate who could not afford a lawyer.
   No volunteers could be found to handle Washington's case until
about a week before his execution date, when he won a stay. His
appeals are still continuing.
   ``He was sitting there waiting to be executed and he couldn't do
anything about it, because he didn't have an attorney,'' Sasser
said. ``The importance of this case is that that won't happen
again, unless the Supreme Court reverses it.''

<HEAD>Doctors Warn Against Cocaine Use with Sex</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Contents of story may be offensive to some readers</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe complications may result if people inject
cocaine into their sex organs to enhance sexual performance or
pleasure, physicians warned in a leading medical journal.
   A letter printed in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association said one man who injected the drug into his urethra
suffered gangrene that led to the amputation of both his legs, nine
fingers and his penis.
   It was not clear how this use of cocaine led to such
``extravagant complications,'' Dr. John C. Mahler and two
colleagues at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said in
the letter.
   The 34-year-old patient, who was not identified, was admitted to
the hospital with an abnormally persistent erection he said had
started three days before, accompanied by painful swelling, the
doctors said.
   The patient told doctors that prior to having sexual intercourse
in previous weeks, he had occasionally injected cocaine into his
urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body.
   The patient said he had taken the drug ``to enhance sexual
performance,'' the doctors said.
   After three days of treatment, the erection and swelling
disappeared, but the patient began developing blood clots in his
limbs, genitals, back and chest, and skin problems so severe that
the patient had to be moved to the hospital's burn unit.
   Eventually, due to necrosis and gangrene, or the death of
tissue, doctors amputated the man's legs above his knee, nine of
his fingers and his penis.
   The New York doctors said they were reporting the 1987 case to
warn doctors about ``this new method of cocaine abuse and ... its
rare and previously unreported complications.''
   Injection or topical application of cocaine to sexual organs in
a bid to heighten sexual pleasure has been reported but is not
believed to be a widespread practice, according to experts on
sexuality and drug abuse cited in Friday's editions of The New York
Times.
   Dr. John Money, an expert in sexuality at Johns Hopkins Medical
School in Baltimore, expressed doubts whether cocaine alone could
have produced the severe complications cited in the letter.
   Some other factor, such as an impurity in the drug, may have
been the cause, he said.
   Mahler said his team had considered such a possibility, but
found no evidence to document it.

   A Nigerian air force MiG crashed into a
police barracks near an air base and killed 12 people, including
the pilot, the military said today.
   Newspapers said at least 21 others were badly burned.
   The air force's logistics command said the Soviet-made fighter
plane crashed into the administrative building of the Nigeria
Police ``C'' division in Makurdi on Friday night.
   The pilot, six policemen, and several civilians died, the
command said in a statement. The civilians had come to the station
to file complaints, it said.
   The statement did not give any other details.
   The 30-year-old plane burst into flames near the city of Makurdi
before crashing, the newspapers said. They said more than 20 other
policemen and a child were badly burned.
   A major air base is located at Makurdi, 370 miles northeast of
Lagos.
   No other details were immediately available.
   Nigeria's air force has at least two versions of the MiG-21.

<TEXT>
   Miami has adopted Tampa's plan to systematically
demolish abandoned houses believed to harbor drug addicts and thugs.
   Heavy bulldozers razed two abandoned houses Friday to initiate
the ``crack attack'' designed to wipe out drug dens in declining
neighborhoods.
   ``This is the kind of full-force effort we need in our city to
get rid of the crack problem,'' said Vice Mayor Rosario Kennedy.
   Ms. Kennedy, with Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman at her side, went
to the dilapidated Overtown section of Miami to announce the plan.
Ms. Freedman began the policy last week when she coaxed private
demolition companies to voluntarily level 50 vacant houses in three
days.
   On Friday, Ms. Kennedy urged other cities to adopt the ``crack
attack'' policy and raze unsafe abandoned structures that create a
haven for drugs and crime. She said Miami had more than 100 such
unsafe structures she would like to see demolished, but first they
have to go through routine condemnation procedures.
   Hector Lima, chief of the Code Enforcement Department, said
Miami has 238 buildings that are being condemned.
   The Miami demolition policy follows a rash of crack-house
burnings in March believed to be the work of anti-drug vigilantes.
Miami fire investigators instituted round-the-clock patrols of
suspected crack houses looking for one or more arsonists, but no
one was arrested.
   After advocating a public-private partnership in the demolition
program, the women climbed up onto a frontend-loader and, with the
guidance of operator Gerardo de Aza, crashed into one of the houses
set for demolition.
   ``The (crack addicts) are just going to go some place and do the
same thing,'' said 22-year-old neighbor Ruben Santiago as he
watched the media swarm around.
   ``It's not useless. They can build something new there. But
(demolition) is not going to stop (the drug dealing). There will
always be crack houses,'' he said.
   While city officials were not sure if the abandoned single-story
wood-frame house had ever been the site of any arrests, Santiago
said there had been several arrests there.
   In his 15 years in the neighborhood, Santiago said, the
structure had been converted from a single-family home to a rooming
house. He said two years ago residents of the area had set the
rooming house on fire to get rid of the crack addicts who lived
there. It had been a shell ever since.
   Angela M. Jordan said she had seen many drug buys on the corner
where the house sat during her four months in the neighborhood.
   ``That will sure get them off the corner,'' she said as the
house shook and piece fell in. ``But if they don't sell drugs
there, they'll go some place else. They'll find someplace to sell
it.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
discussed his Middle East peace plans with the leaders of Egypt and
Jordan today and called for a settlement based on Palestinian
rights as well as Israeli security.
   ``This is not a matter of winner-take-all, in which one side can
win everything it wants,'' he said in a prepared statement on
arrival in Jordan from Egypt.
   ``Palestinians and Israelis must learn to treat each other
decently, respect their mutual right to live in security and
fulfill their political aspirations,'' Shultz said.
   Foreign Minister Taher Masri met Shultz at Amman's military
airport and escorted him to the royal palace where he had talks
over lunch with King Hussein.
   In his arrival statement, Shultz said ``Jordan has a crucial
role to play'' in Arab peace with its western neighbor, Israel.
   Shultz has stressed that Israelis and Palestinians both have
legitimate claims to the land held by Israel, and said there is
room for them to live together. He listed as his first goal
Israel's exchange of land for Arab recognition.
   Second on his list in the arrival statement was a call for an
``equitable settlement of the land issue,'' although he said it was
up to the participants to decide how much territory Israel should
give up.
   Before leaving Cairo, Shultz met with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in private for about an hour, then for another hour with
aides.
   ``We're off to a good start, I think,'' Shultz said following
the talks.
   Shultz was due to fly back to Cairo tonight.
   In earlier remarks to reporters traveling with him, the
secretary conceded that he is shuttling again between Arabs and
Israelis with no indication they are willing to accept his plan for
negotiations.
   The trip marks his fourth effort this year to provide
Palestinian Arabs self-rule _ but not statehood _ as the first step
toward setting up talks on an overall Middle East settlement.
   ``You have to be willing to work against the odds, to swim
against the current, in the hope (that) by keeping at it eventually
you get some way, if you can,'' Shultz told reporters on his flight
to Cairo from London.
   As he arrived Friday night, he read a five-page statement
exhorting Arabs and Israelis ``to lay aside prejudices, hatred and
overblown dreams in favor of a negotiated settlement.''
   His message seemed aimed at Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, who resists ending Israel's occupation of West Bank land in
exchange for peace, and at Arab extremists seeking to overthrow the
Jewish state.
   ``Too often, people become convinced that only their dream or
their causes are legitimate,'' Shultz said. ``They deny the rights
of others. They avoid the realism on the ground.''
   In deference to Mubarak, who has endorsed the U.S. plan in
principle, Shultz made Cairo his base, with today's flight to
Jordan and hops Sunday to Israel and Monday to Syria.
   The trip was slotted in between the Moscow superpower summit
meeting in Moscow and an Arab summit opening Tuesday in Algeria.
   The Kremlin has backed Arab demands for a peace conference in
which the big powers, including the Soviet Union, could influence a
settlement. Shamir and Shultz want the conference to be no more
than an umbrella for direct negotiations between Arabs and Israelis.
   Shultz suggested the Soviets may be inching away from their
position. ``They have started to use the word `effective' rather
than `authoritative,' and they've made a point of saying that
wasn't a loose slip of the tongue,'' he said.
   According to reports in Israel and the Persian Gulf, Shultz is
thinking of revising his negotiation plan to provide for Egyptian
participation in deciding the future of the Israeli-held Gaza Strip.
   The reports have Egyptians joining Palestinians in a delegation
dealing with Gaza, while Jordan and another Palestinian group would
negotiate with Israel over the West Bank.
   Egypt administered Gaza and Jordan controlled the West Bank
until Israel took both territories in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said in an interview Friday with Radio Monte Carlo:
``There cannot be a solution if the Palestinian question is
ignored. As long as Shultz wants to omit this basic point in the
Middle East, his initative will not work. If he has anything new to
say, let him go ahead.''
   The Shultz plan does not call for a Palestinian state. It would
give the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza
some control over their daily affairs, with the territories' final
status left for future negotiations.

<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists today shot and killed a
Sikh freelance reporter in the northern state of Punjab in the 10th
Sikh assassination of a journalist in the past eight years.
   The Press Trust of India said Parduman Singh, 55, was shot
outside a school he runs in Hoshiarpur, 75 miles northwest of the
state capital at Chandigarh.
   PTI said shopkeepers and businessmen closed their stores to
protest the slaying.
   Singh was a stringer for PTI, the English-language Indian
Express newspaper and several Punjab-based papers.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 in
Punjab for an independent homeland. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.
   The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, say they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   Singh was the second Sikh journalist slain in Hoshiarpur in the
past month. On May 4, a Punjabi newspaper editor, Bant Singh, was
shot to death by Sikh radicals.
   The first journalist felled by Sikh assassins was Lala Jagat
Narian, editor of the Hind Samachar group of newspapers. He was
killed on Sept. 9, 1981. His son and successor, Ramesh Chander, was
shot to death in 1984.
   Police today recovered another decomposed body from the Golden
Temple complex at Amritsar. It was the 22nd corpse found inside
Sihkdom's holiest shrine since police ended a 10-day siege of the
complex on May 18.
   Some of the 200 Sikh extremists and sympathizers who surrendered
during the siege confessed that nearly 40 people were tortured and
killed by Sikh radicals and their bodies buried inside the complex.
Some were people who had gone to the shrine to pray.
   The extremists also have been blamed for the deaths of more than
1,250 people in hit-and-run attacks around the state this year.
Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed to
the separatist campaign.

   An off-duty militiaman was shot
to death outside his home in Northern Ireland today, the eighth
member of the Ulster Defense Regiment to be killed this year,
police said.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility.
   Lance Cpl. Michael Darcy, 28, a bachelor living with his widowed
mother, was killed as he parked his car outside his home in
Castlederg.
   ``He had no time to fire back. A man was seen running from the
scene and we assume it was a terrorist crime,'' a Belfast police
spokesman said.
   The town is close to the Irish Republic border and 65 miles west
of Belfast.
   The killing brought the known death toll in the province to
2,648 by police count since 1969, when the IRA launched its violent
campaign to end British rule and unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.

   A teen-age couple hacked the girl's mother to
death with a knife and machete because she opposed their romance,
police said.
   ``Between the two of them, they hacked approximately 10 to 12
times,'' Assistant Police Chief Aaron Rosenthal said Friday.
   The attack took place May 24 but the body of Adrienne Lomax, 44,
was not discovered until Thursday, under blankets and coats in the
foyer of her East Village apartment.
   Andrea Williams, 15, and her 17-year-old boyfriend, Mario
Garcia, were arrested Thursday night. They face charges of murder
and weapons possession.
   The attack occurred during a fight, Rosenthal said, but the
murder was premeditated.
   ``Garcia brought the knife and the machete for the sole purpose
of killing the mother,'' he said.
   A neighbor, Paul Butler, who heard the attack said, ``They
frequently had these arguments, and I thought this was just another
argument.''
   Rosenthal said Mrs. Lomax, a receptionist for an investment
banking company, came home May 24 and found Garcia with her
daughter.
   Mrs. Lomax had objected from the start to the 18-month romance
and in the argument that followed the daughter picked up ``a Rambo
knife, 10 inches long with a six-inch blade, and stabbed her mother
in the back,'' said Rosenthal.
   ``At one point the mother ran to the front door, opened the door
and her neighbor saw her fingers and heard her screaming. They
pulled her back in and they continued to hack at her and when the
neighbor said `What's going on?' the daughter screamed, `We're
having a fight _ leave us alone,' '' the chief said.
   ``In the course of hacking at the body, he with the machete and
she with the Rambo knife, they each cut the other. He required 10
to 12 stitches and she required six stitches.''
   The couple went from the apartment to the home of Garcia's
relatives, where they explained their bleeding by saying they had
just been wounded fighting off would-be robbers in the park.
   After being sewn up at a hospital, police took them to the
Seventh Precinct station to look at mug shots and try to identify
their ``attackers.''
   The next day, the girl called her mother's office to report her
ill. After trying several times to reach her by telephone, Mrs.
Lomax's employers got in touch with Housing Authority police, who
discovered the body Thursday morning.
   Garcia and Miss Williams were arrested that night near his East
Village home.
   Miss Williams, whom Rosenthal said was being charged as an
adult, was the youngest of Mrs. Lomax's six children and the last
still living with her.

   Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, serving a
life term for attempting to kill then-President Gerald R. Ford in
1975, has been transferred from a federal prison in West Virginia
to the Lexington Federal Correctional Institution in Kentucky,
officials said today.
   Fromme, who was sentenced May 25 to an additional 15 months in
prison for escaping from the all-female Alderson Federal
Correctional Institution in West Virginia, was moved Friday to the
Lexington prison, said Alderson Warden Ron Burkhart.
   ``It's basically a level 1 security installation but within that
institution we operate a high security unit,'' Burkhart said.
``She'll be housed in the high security unit.'' Lexington is
basically a minimum security institution, while Alderson is medium
security. But Alderson had no facility for housing dangerous
inmates or those considered escape risks.
   During her sentencing on the escape charge, Fromme told U.S.
District Court Judge Elizabeth V. Hallanan in Beckley that she
couldn't promise that she would not try to escape again.
   Fromme had said she escaped from Alderson on Dec. 23, 1987, in
order to be closer to convicted mass cult killer Charles Manson,
who is serving a life term in San Quentin in California.
   Fromme said in a telephone interview in early May she had hoped
to be moved to a federal prison in California to have better
contact with Manson.
   ``I've been working on getting him back to court,'' she said.
   Fromme, 39, spent two days wandering in the Appalachian
mountains around the prison before she was recaptured, rain-soaked,
on Christmas Day.
   Fromme was the first person sentenced under a special federal
law covering assaults on presidents, a statute enacted after the
1963 assasination of President John F. Kennedy.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis returned today to the campaign trail in
New Jersey, ``very relieved'' by the success of delicate spinal
surgery on wife Kitty, while Jesse Jackson sought support in
California in the final weekend of the 1988 presidential primary
season.
   For Republican George Bush, vice presidential duties took
precedence over campaign activities as he welcomed President Reagan
back from the superpower summit, praising him for a job ``well
done,'' and visited ailing Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte.
   Dukakis had canceled campaign plans Thursday and Friday,
including a final debate with Jackson, to be at a Boston hospital
while his wife underwent a five-hour operation to repair two
ruptured discs in her neck that doctors said were pressing on her
spinal column.
   ``I talked to Kitty in the recovery room and she said she wanted
an ice cream and a massage,'' said Dukakis following the surgery.
   ``I'm prepared to provide both.''
   Dukakis said he was ``very, very relieved'' at the apparent
success of the surgery and that doctors said his wife faces an
``excellent'' prognosis.
   ``She certainly is not going to be able to do any serious
campaigning for a while,'' Dukakis added.
   The Democratic front-runner was to spend most of today visiting
his wife and then fly to Cherry Hill in New Jersey, the fourth
state to hold its primary Tuesday, for a picnic and other
activities Sunday. He planned to return later Sunday to California
for the final days of the presidential primary season to vie for
the 314 delegates at stake there.
   Bush led the estimated 3,000 people gathered at Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington in a campaign-style welcome Friday
for Reagan's return from an 11,000-mile trip highlighted by the
signing and exchange of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
treaty with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Welcome home and well done,'' said Bush, the all-but-certain
GOP nominee.
   Bush praised Reagan for raising the issue of human rights ``in
the heart of the Soviet system.''
   ``This week, an American president strode the hard ground of Red
Square, and reminded the world ... what a bracing thing freedom is
...,'' Bush added.
   Earlier Bush, returning from a campaign hiatus in Maine, made an
unannounced visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington
where the president of El Salvador is suffering from stomach and
liver cancer.
   During the 30-minute visit, Bush ``wished Duarte well and
expressed his gratitude for what he's done for democracy,'' said
the vice president's spokeswoman Kristin Taylor.
   Campaigning to smaller than usual crowds Friday in Montana,
Jackson said at an airport rally ``we cannot measure human beings
and their needs just by their political capital. ... It's their
humanity at stake.''
   Later Jackson offered a prayer for Mrs. Dukakis when he shared
the speaker's podium at a dinner with John Dukakis, the Democratic
front-runner's son.
   Saying ``I want to keep him there four more years,'' Jackson
praised the Massachusetts governor for the job he's done in the
state.
   He said he did not know the context of comments reportedly made
by his campaign manager Gerald Austin that the strongest Democratic
ticket would be Dukakis and Ohio Sen. John Glenn, adding that he
would not consider vice presidential options until after Tuesday's
primaries.
   Jackson was to return to California today to the rural town of
McFarland which has been plagued by an unexplained and unusually
high cancer rate.

   Residents of Riverside and San
Bernardino counties were rattled by an earthquake that was widely
felt but caused no injuries or damage, authorities reported.
   The quake, measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:32
p.m. Friday, said Hall Daily, a spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   It was centered six miles east of Redlands, near the boundary
dividing the two counties and about 70 miles east of Los Angeles,
Daily said.
   ``It was strongly felt in Riverside,'' said Kathy Watts, a
scientist at the Pasadena lab.
   Callers from San Bernardino and from Idyllwild, in the San
Jacinto Mountains, also reported feeling the jolt.
   But Riverside police received no reports of injuries or damage,
Sgt. Joanne Flores said.
   ``It wasn't that hard of an earthquake,'' said Lee Hester, a
police dispatcher in Hemet, about 20 miles southeast of the
epicenter. He said no damage was reported there.
   The Richter scale is an indirect gauge of the energy released by
an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. For small quakes, every increase of one number means a
tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 to 4 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area in places such as Southern California
where building codes are strict.

   The outlawed Irish Republican
Army claimed responsibility Saturday for the fatal shooting of an
off-duty member of the Ulster Defense Regiment security force.
   Lance Cpl. Michael Darcy, 28, was shot early Saturday while
parking his car outside the home he shared with his widowed mother
in Castlederg, 65 miles west of Belfast.
   ``He had no time to fire back,'' a Belfast police spokesman

   The IRA is fighting to oust the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly
Roman Catholic Irish Republic. It made its claim in a statement to
the news media.
   The British-trained Ulster Defense Regiment is a mainly
Protestant security force.

   Neighbors and workers from a painting
business rallied to support a black couple whose house and cars
were vandalized two weeks after they moved into a mostly white
neighborhood.
   Painters covered over graffiti that was spray-painted on
Michelle and Charles Berkley's house, the slashed tires on their
two cars were replaced, and a steady stream of neighbors stopped by
to assure the family they were welcome in the middle-class,
suburban neighborhood.
   ``It's been great,'' Berkley said. ``There are just so many
people concerned about us, and the concern seems so geniune. The
phone has been ringing off the hook.''
   The Berkleys discovered the graffiti when they awoke at about 5
a.m. Thursday. It included words like ``Liberal,'' ``Screw,'' and
``Welcome,'' scrawled all over the house.
   Throughout the day Thursday and again Friday, the Berkleys' new
neighbors called and stopped in to tell them how sorry they were,
the family said.
   Friday morning, volunteers from Ocean State Painting and
Powerwashing of East Greenwich showed up to repaint the house. By
noon, the house was beige again, with no sign of graffiti.
   `It's nice to be able to help out someone in need like this,''
said Kevin Mullen, president of the painting company. ``It was
sickening. This is the 1980s, not the 1920s.''
   Bruce Hevenor of Coldwell Banker, the real estate company that
handled the house sale, said the office got several anonymous,
threatening calls when the Berkleys bought the house. The company
told the family of the calls prior to the sale, he said, adding,
``I admire them for moving in.''
   ``The neighbors are going to back them up 100 percent,'' said
one neighbor, Barbara Capabianco. ``We've lived here 25 years, and
this is scary. The whole thing is so ... wrong.''

<TEXT>
   About 150 workers of the country's
largest cotton mill marched through this central city Saturday to
protest wage cuts, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   The demonstrators from the Djuro Salaj mill met at the town hall
with city and factory officials and protested a salary slash of
14.2 percent planned this month, the report said. Wages were also
cut in May, after the government launched major austerity measures.
   The program included substantial price hikes, wage cuts of up to
30 percent and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the dinar, the
national currency. It is designed to curb the country's 170 percent
inflation rate and help repay a $21 billion foreign debt.
   The average monthly pay at the mill has been a little less than
$125 a month.
   The protest came after a three-day strike at the factory
involving about 2,000 workers.
   The influential Belgrade daily Politika said Saturday that after
the austerity measures were announced, some companies raised prices
100 percent or more. It said most price increases were 30 percent
to 95 percent.
   The government has appealed to manufacturers to show restraint
in raising prices, the state-run media reported.
   After a meeting on Friday, the government called on ``all
organizations ... which hiked their prices over and above plans to
obligatorily reexamine and change their decisions.''

   Michael Dukakis resumed his Democratic presidential
campaign today with a trip to New Jersey, as doctors said his wife
Kitty was ``doing very well'' in the aftermath of major back surgery.
   Doctors said Mrs. Dukakis came through the five-hour surgery
without problems and faced an ``excellent'' prognosis.
   Mrs. Dukakis was moved out of intensive care at Massachusetts
General Hospital this morning to the hospital's private wing,
hospital spokesman Martin Bander said today.
   He said her doctor reported that ``Mrs. Dukakis walked around the
room and showed good strength. She has no sign of the neurological
problem that necessitated the operation.'' Bander added, ``She's
doing very well. Her spirit's good.''
   After being with his wife since late Thursday at Massachusetts
General Hospital, the Democratic presidential front-runner flew to
Cherry Hill, N.J., for a picnic and other campaign events.
   Dukakis was picking up a campaign schedule broken off when he
flew back from San Francisco, canceling his last scheduled debate
with rival Jesse Jackson to be with his wife of 25 years when she
underwent urgent surgery to repair two herniated discs in her neck.
   The Massachusetts governor planned to return to see her again
tonight and spend the night at home, then return to New Jersey for
more events Sunday morning before flying back to California for
campaigning before Tuesday's primary finale.
   He did not plan to reschedule the debate with Jackson.
   ``I talked to Kitty in the recovery room and she said she wanted
an ice cream and a massage,'' Dukakis said following the surgery
Friday. ``I'm prepared to provide both.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was spending the night in intensive care, and faced
another week of hospitalization before she was expected to be
released. Doctors said she would wear a neck brace for six weeks or
more, and will limp for a number of weeks as a result of the graft
taken from her hip and fused between the vertebrae in her back to
replace the discs that were removed.
   ``She certainly is not going to be able to do any serious
campaigning for a while,'' Dukakis said.
   Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas and Dr. Lawrence Borges, neurosurgeons who
performed the operation, said Mrs. Dukakis appeared to have regained
full neurological function following the delicate surgery in which
disc fragments were found pressing against the spinal column.
   She was awake soon after surgery and reported that the numbness
and tingling sensations that had plagued her appeared gone.
   The doctors said that if uncorrected, the problem could have
resulted in paralysis from the shoulders down.
   ``The operation went very well. There were no problems at all,''
Borges said. ``I think the prognosis from this point should be
excellent.''
   Dukakis praised the doctors as ``terrific'' and said, ``We're
very, very relieved, and very pleased.''
   Zervas said Mrs. Dukakis would not require any special drug
treatment or attention as a result of a previous long-term
dependency on amphetamines. Last year she revealed she had been
addicted to the drug, prescribed as diet pills, for 26 years before
shaking the dependency at a drug clinic in 1982.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cook County Hospital doctor who won a court
battle to keep his job even though he suffered from AIDS has died,
officials said.
   Dr. Alan Bouffard, 42, a neurologist, headed the neurology clinic
and electroencephalographic laboratory at the hospital, officials
said. His name was not released during the court proceedings that
led to a consent decree allowing him to keep full medical privileges
over the initial objections of the Cook County Board.
   He died of AIDS complications May 25, and in accordance with his
wishes, no services were scheduled, the Chicago Tribune reported
Saturday.
   ``He never wavered, not for a moment, in his commitment to pursue
full remedy and reinstatement consistent with good medical
practice,'' said Harvey Grossman, his lawyer and legal director of
the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``He understood on many levels what the issues were for
(AIDS-)infected people like himself,'' Grossman said. ``As a doctor,
he knew both the facts of transmission and the implications of not
continuing to participate in society.''
   In February 1987, the Cook County Board voted to deny Bouffard
medical privileges at the county hospital out of fear he might
contaminate patients. The hospital's executive medical staff voted
to reinstate him, and the case went to court.
   On Feb. 24, 1988, a consent decree issued by a federal court in
Chicago restored all his medical privileges, while requiring him to
wear double gloves for certain procedures.
   His efforts were on behalf of the rights of all people who have
the AIDS-causing virus to continue as productive members of society,
Grossman said.
   ``He was a very courageous man,'' the lawyer added.
   Bouffard received the 1988 Civil Liberties Award of the ACLU of
Illinois in a private ceremony several weeks ago.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's
defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening
infections and certain cancers.
   The virus that causes the incurable and fatal syndrome is
believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before
or during birth.
   A co-worker, Dr. James Stone, described Bouffard as a free
thinker who kept his private life to himself.
   ``He worked hard and came in early,'' Stone said. ``He was Cook
County's expert on brain wave analysis and nerve-muscle diseases.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Halt To Drug Testing Of Detroit Police Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEOFFREY HAYNES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug testing of Detroit's 5,000-member police
force was ordered stopped, at least temporarily, by a federal judge
who said he's not convinced the department has a widespread drug
problem.
   U.S. District Judge Horace Gilmore ordered Friday that the
testing be halted until a hearing can be held to determine the
merits of the practice.
   The ruling came after the American Civil Liberties Union filed
suit on behalf of 70 city employees seeking to stop the testing,
which has been conducted on about 1,000 officers since it began May
26.
   ``It's ironic that out of the first 1,000 officers tested, the
department said none tested positive for drugs,'' said William
Werthheimer Jr., an attorney for the ACLU. ``That's not consistent
with a departmentwide problem.''
   The judge said his decision was based on a federal appeals court
ruling last month in a case from Chattanooga, Tenn. The appeals
court said that unless there is evidence of a widespread drug
problem in a police department, mass testing violates Fourth
Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches.
   Detroit Police Department spokesman Fred Zaharoff said the
department would abide by the decision, but declined further comment.
   The injunction granted by Gilmore prohibits the testing until 5
p.m. Tuesday, by which time the parties expect to hold a hearing on
the merits of the tests.
   The Detroit police department has been rocked recently by
suspensions of 14 officers for drug use and reports that an
additional 100 officers are under investigation for crack cocaine
use or other crack-related crimes.
   Under Detroit's drug testing program, police officers who test
positive for cocaine or heroin would be subject to firing after a
four-step retesting process. Officers testing positive for marijuana
could remain on the force after a suspension and education program.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan shed a symbolic burden at the
Moscow summit that he had carried for five years _ his own
description of the Kremlin as an ``evil empire.''
   It was a remark that Reagan had uttered only once, but it had
burned in the Soviet consciousness since 1983, an oft-quoted and
inescapable reminder of superpower tensions. Finally, to the private
delight of White House officials, it was gone.
   ``That was a different time, a different era,'' Reagan said,
standing on the cobblestones of Red Square alongside Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the architect of ambitious social and economic changes
that the United States wants to encourage.
   Reagan's repudiation bolstered the already-improved ties between
the United States and Soviet Union and cleared the stage for another
president to move in next January to manage superpower relations,
unfettered by the rhetorical extremes of his predecessor.
   Gorbachev took immense satisfaction in Reagan's retraction. He
quoted a Greek philosopher as saying, ``Everything flows, everything
changes.''
   Indeed, the word ``change'' is an understatement for what has
happened in the remarkable 30-month summit relationship of Reagan
and Gorbachev.
   The two superpowers, owners of the world's deadliest arsenals of
nuclear weapons, have made a dramatic leap, from open hostility and
isolation to warmth and frequent contacts at the highest level.
   Make no mistake, there still are deep differences. The
superpowers are deadlocked over terms of a strategic arms reduction
treaty (START), and Gorbachev bridled at Reagan's lectures about
human rights in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet leader said that the Kremlin ``will not accept any
advice on how to run our affairs. We do not need anyone else's
model. We do not need anyone else's values.''
   Yet, things are different.
   Since the first Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in 1985, superpower
summitry has become so routine that White House officials are not
embarrassed by the fact that the latest meeting did not produce any
breakthroughs or concrete achievements.
   ``We can't give you a Superbowl game every couple of weeks or
months,'' said Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national
security adviser.
   ``We have to take this slowly, this is too important to rush,''
Powell said. ``In the next six months, the next six years, if you
don't come home with a (START) treaty that the experts, the
Congress, don't see as strong ... it'll never be ratified.''
   There is little likelihood a START treaty will be concluded under
Reagan.
   With time running out on his administration, the negotiators will
not return to Geneva until July 12 to resume negotiations.
   ``We set no deadline,'' Reagan said. ``You don't make a treaty
just to simply have it be achieved at a certain point in time.''
   However, Powell, talking with reporters on Air Force One as
Reagan flew back to Washington, said U.S.-Soviet relations now are
``solidly in place without a lot of ups and downs, without too many
sharp turns that cause people to have anxiety. It is a fairly
stable, maturing, growing relationship.''
   To underscore his point, Powell noted that Secretary of State
George P. Shultz has had something like 26 meetings with his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze.
   In the absence of concrete achievements, White House officials
said Reagan's real accomplishments were his appearances before
Soviet students, intellectuals, dissidents, writers and monks at the
Danilov monastery. He argued for greater freedom for the Soviet
people and respect for human rights.
   ``I submit to you that that is real substance,'' Powell said.
``When you can take that kind of message directly to the people of
the Soviet Union in the person of the president of the United
States, that goes well beyond form, that goes well beyond style.
That is substance.''
   Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a well-known Soviet poet, emphasized the
symbolic importance of Reagan's appearances.
   ``Mr. Reagan doesn't belong to the kind of intellectual elite. He
represents the ordinary American people, he speaks for the silent
majority,'' Yevtushenko said in Moscow last week.
   ``If he takes the first step into the Kremlin, it was the
so-called American people _ they made the step, too,'' Yevtushenko
said.
   The summit appeared to be an exhausting experience for the
77-year-old Reagan.
   He acknowledged he returned home tired, but said he was
exhilarated. ``The events of this week in Moscow were momentous. Not
conclusive, perhaps, but momentous,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, who refused to meet with Gorbachev's three predecessors,
attributed most of the evolution in U.S.-Soviet relations to
Gorbachev, a leader who, the president said, is ``a serious man,
seeking serious reform.''
   Reagan also said in a speech in London that the West should
``embrace honest change when it occurs, but let us also be wary and
ever vigilant.''
   That responsibility soon will be passed to Democrat Michael
Dukakis or Republican George Bush, whoever wins the presidential
election in November.
   ``I think it's a relationship that will be built on by the next
administration, regardless of which party wins the election,''
Powell said.
   He said that Moscow will continue working actively with Reagan,
``But at the same time, it would be not smart of them not to begin
thinking about the next administration. It also would be not awfully
responsible of us not to begin preparing them for the next president.
   ``As we get later into the year,'' Powell said, ``we'll start to
do our own transition activities to the next president ... to make
sure that this relationship, this transition (occurs) in a smooth,
satisfactory way.''

<HEAD>European Governments Shun Calls For Legalized Drugs</HEAD>

   The debate in the United States over legalization
of drugs is having little impact in Western Europe. Most governments
on this side of the Atlantic favor even tougher drug laws, despite
claims that severity only aggravates the problem.
   Support for legalizing drugs appears confined to certain European
law- enforcment officers and drug-rehabilitation workers, who argue
that harsh laws encourage crime, help spread AIDS and do little to
cure addicts.
   Just two years after the European Parliament narrowly rejected a
proposal to legalize marijuana, no government or major political
party in Europe is calling for legalized drugs.
   In Norway, ``there is massive and unambiguous support in the
Parliament, in the administration and in the population for our
official hard-line policy,'' said Ketil Bentzen, the government's
adviser on drugs.
   ``A politician who would bring up legalization of drugs would at
once be politically dead,'' Bentzen said.
   A 1986 report by the European Parliament said heroin abuse has
become ``an epidemic of serious proportions'' since the mid-1970s,
and it estimated that there were 1.5 million heroin addicts in the
12-nation European Economic Community.
   ``The rapidity with which hard drugs, particularly heroin, have
taken hold on all Western European nations is alarming,'' the report
said. It predicted a similar explosion in cocaine use.
   The Parliament concluded that relaxed drug laws would encourage
more addiction. It urged greater cooperation among law-enforcement
agencies in tracking down drug suppliers and smugglers.
   The debate over decriminalization seems to be gaining momentum
from a campaign for repeal of drug laws in the United States, where
several congressmen and mayors have suggested that the war on drugs
is a losing battle.
   For example, the Paris weekly Journal du Dimanche published
reader reaction to an article by Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke in the
International Herald Tribune. Schmoke has proposed congressional
hearings on whether decriminalizing narcotics can reduce
drug-related crime.
   The French newspaper found few in favor of relaxing the country's
drug laws.
   But it quoted Georges Asap, prosecutor in the southeastern city
of Valence, as saying: ``In less than five years, the
decriminalization of all drugs will be a reality. Simply because one
can't do otherwise. It's been 30 years now I've been putting people
in prison for using or selling drugs, knowing all along it served no
purpose.''
   Because of its relaxed attitude toward drugs, the Netherlands has
become a haven for foreign addicts, especially those from West
Germany and Italy.
   Amsterdam alone has an estimated 7,000 junkies and drug abuse has
become so entrenched that a bus circulates through the capital
distributing free methadone. Addicts have their own union.
   Although police turn a blind eye to marijuana, authorities are
reluctant to legalize drugs outright.
   Utrecht's police commissioner, Jan Wiarda, argues that legalizing
drugs would reduce crime but says the Netherlands could not take
such a step unless neighboring countries did the same.
   Last year, the European Movement for the Normalization of Drug
Policy was set up in the Dutch city of Rotterdam to muster support
for legalized drugs. It now has representatives in 10 countries.
   The group's British representative is Dr. Russell Newcombe, a
researcher for the Regional Drug Training and Information Center in
the northwest port city of Liverpool, which has one of Britain's
worst drug problems.
   Newcombe said in an interview that the group wants first to
remove penalties for possession. It ultimately hopes to persuade
governments to ration supplies to addicts.
   ``We have patiently failed in our efforts over the past two
decades to prevent the use of illegal drugs,'' Newcombe said. ``More
importantly, we have failed to prevent the kinds of problems illegal
drugs can lead to. Problems like AIDS and crime are not due to
drugs, but to the fact that drugs are illegal and users are driven
underground.''
   But governments have kept cracking down. For example:
   _The Swedish Parliament passed a bill May 19 outlawing not just
drug possession but drug use.
   _The British Parliament passed a law in 1986 empowering police
and courts to confiscate drug profits and increasing the maximum
penalty for trafficking from 14 years to life imprisonment.
   _Norway doubled the maximum penalty for drugs offenses to 20
years in 1984.
   There also appears to be strong support for repealing Italy's
1975 law exempting from prosecution possession of small amounts of
drugs for personal use.
   Greek drug rehabilitation centers also are campaigning to make
the country's already tough laws even tougher.
   ``We have fought many trends that call for looser drug laws,''
said Kalliopi Boudouroglou, a member of the Panhellenic Coordinating
Committee Against Narcotics. ``Legalization isn't even being
considered.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city has been a pace-setter in crime since
the machine-gun days of Al Capone and John Dillinger, but so far it
has oddly missed out on crack, the devastating new form of cocaine.
   The crystalline or granular form of the narcotic, available in
small doses at bargain-basement prices, is wreaking havoc in New
York, Los Angeles, Miami, Detroit and other cities.
   But not in Chicago.
   ``Cocaine, without a doubt, is our No. 1 priority. Seventy-five
percent of our cases in the last fiscal year were cocaine-related,''
said spokesman Fran Hirzy at the local office of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   ``But crack _ it's not here.''
   Commander John R. Ryle of the Police Department's narcotics
division agrees.
   ``We've not been able to purchase any or even raid a crack house.
Certainly it's unusual,'' Ryle said.
   Theories abound as to why a city flush with contraband has so far
escaped one of the nation's biggest urban nightmares.
   ``Perhaps it's the adverse publicity about what this stuff can do
to you. It's the most dangerous addiction on the street,'' Hirzy
said.
   And the gangs who control much of the city's drug trafficking can
be curiously conservative, said sociologist Hugh Horan at the
University of Illinois-Chicago school of public health.
   They may simply not want to diversify from cocaine in powder
form, Horan said.
   On the West Side, police Sgt. Gene Connelly of the gang-narcotics
unit deals with the notorious Vice Lords gang, whose members number
in the thousands.
   Their primary enterprise is peddling narcotics, mostly cocaine.
But not crack.
   ``From January 1 to May 1, we conducted 566 raids. We have yet to
come across crack,'' Connelly said. ``For the year of 1987, we had
1,628 raids and did not come across it.
   ``You'd think somehow out of all the raids, either with a search
warrant on a house or a simple stop on the street, we'd find it. But
we haven't come up with one piece of crack.
   ``I talk to cops with other towns and they think it's coming from
here. I tell them, `We ain't got it.'''
   City gangs are involved in street sales of marijuana, cocaine,
PCP and heroin, but Ryle said crack makes up ``maybe less than 1
percent of all cocaine received by the police department.''
   Crack has appeared on U.S. police blotters since 1981, according
to the DEA.
   Popular in the inner cities because it can be bought in small
quantities for as little as $5, crack is smoked and can take effect
in 10 seconds _ much faster than cocaine in powder form, which is
snorted.
   But a 22-page DEA internal report on crack, published earlier
this year, said of Chicago:
   ``No cases are currently under investigation or being developed
... as no serious crack problem exists in this city.''
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas says the lull may be temporary,
noting that cocaine ports like New York, Miami and Los Angeles are
flooded with the drug.
   ``And when something like this hits the coasts, we usually follow
the trend,'' Valukas said.
   But crack already is a problem of staggering proportions in
another Midwest city. Detroit, a long way from either ocean, has an
estimated 1,000 crack houses.
   Illegal drugs are readily available here in the nation's
third-largest city, a transportation hub and key distribution point
for goods of all kinds.
   In February, federal agents at O'Hare International Airport found
165 pounds of heroin worth $1.8 billion hidden in religious statues
from Thailand.
   On May 24, police and federal drug agents confiscated 247 pounds
of brown heroin _ the largest single seizure in U.S. history.
   Last July, Attorney General Edwin Meese III told reporters the
government had seized 2{ tons of cocaine at a fruit market after
tracking it from Florida.

<HEAD>US Concerned about Salvador's Fate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even before Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte learned he was suffering from cancer, the Reagan
administration was concerned that the special relationship it had
forged with El Savador under Duarte's leadership could begin to wane.
   Duarte has been a favorite of Republicans and Democrats alike in
the Congress, and since his election four years ago, El Salvador has
received $1.5 billion in U.S. economic aid and $455 million in
military aid, levels unmatched elsewhere in Latin America.
   But Duarte's Christian Democratic Party is deeply split, raising
the clear possibility that victory in the 1989 presidential
elections may go to the rightist ARENA party, which made a strong
showing in legislative elections last March.
   Many in Congress are wary of ARENA because of the party's reputed
links to death squad activities, and there is some doubt among State
Department officials about whether the lawmakers will be as generous
with an ARENA-run government as they have with Duarte at the helm.
   Duarte was already a lame duck president when, according to U.S.
officials, he learned that the cancer which has affected his liver
and stomach is terminal.
   ``The only question is how long he will live,'' said one
official, adding that his survival may only be a matter of months.
Spokesmen at Walter Reed Army Hospital, where Duarte has been
confined since Wednesday, have discussed Duarte's condition only in
general terms.
   According to a State Department official, Duarte's illness has
prompted discussions among Salvadoran officials about the
possibility of Duarte's resigning.
   ARENA soon will begin laying the groundwork for an effort to
portray the party as a moderate force in Salvadoran politics that
contrasts with the unsavory image it has among many in Congress.
   The party's nominee for president is Alfredo Cristiani, a
U.S.-educated businessmen who is widely admired by U.S. diplomats.
He will visit Washington June 20-24, partly in hopes of convincing
members of Congress that ARENA, much like the major U.S. parties,
believes in democracy, free enterprise and anti-communism.
   But the close ties the United States currently has with El
Salvador could suffer a setback if, in the event of an ARENA
victory, Cristiani emerges merely as a front man for another party
chieftain, Roberto D'Aubuisson.
   D'Aubuisson, a former military officer and a founder of ARENA,
was once characterized by former U.S. Ambassador Robert White as a
``pathological killer.''
   But Cristiani should be able to win backing from the U.S.
Congress if he is perceived to be in control of the government,
according to officials.
   Continued U.S. support for El Salvador is considered crucial if
the fledgling democratic system there is to survive the challenge of
a determined leftist insurgency.
   Much of the U.S. strategy in Central America is based on the
importance of preventing a guerrilla victory in El Salvador. And it
was only with Duarte's 1984 victory that Congress was able to
embrace the administration strategy.
   He is seen here not only as a man with impeccable democratic
credentials but also as perhaps the most pro-American president in
Latin America. Once, during a White House welcoming ceremony, he
kissed an American flag.
   Duarte's tenure has been marked by both great achievement as well
as tragedy and disappointment. He has worked hard to create a
democratic climate in El Salvador and has shown himself to be
willing to make and carry out decisions that are unpopular with the
military.
   Although there has been an increase recently in politically
motivated killings, the figures are only a fraction of what they
were when the civil war started eight years ago.
   But Duarte's quasi-socialistic policies have enraged the business
sector, and U.S. officials say he is partly to blame for the
country's unimpressive economic performance in recent years.
   The rebel movement has survived the large infusions of U.S.
military aid and it appears to be prepared to continue its struggle
for years. It recently promised to increase its activities.
   Duarte's tenure also has been marked by tragedy. A daughter was
kidnaped for 44 days early in Duarte's term, and a 1986 earthquake
in San Salvador caused widespread suffering. He now faces a
different type of challenge.
   After tests on Thursday to determine the extent of his cancer,
Duarte told reporters, ``One thing is assured. I'll fight it out
because I believe in God.''

   Three suspects arrested for selling drugs in an
apartment building were each carrying crack. Each was carrying a
loaded pistol.
   None was older than 15.
   ``They were hardnosed,'' police Inspector Philip Sheridan
recalled. ``They were actually berating us for arresting them.''
   Surrounded by the drug trade and the violence it breeds, some of
New York City's children tote guns as casually as others carry
school books or baseball gloves.
   In Brooklyn's Crown Heights, a poor neighborhood a half-hour
subway ride from midtown Manhattan, kids act ``like they have a
license to carry guns,'' said the Rev. Hardy Smallwood Jr., a
community leader.
   He said parents are increasingly afraid of their own children,
and the cause is clear. ``It's all crack, that's what it's all
about,'' he said. ``It's a never-ending battle.''
   Before the rise of crack, a potent, inexpensive form of cocaine,
``we never had this amount of violence,'' said Sheridan, who has
arrested boys as young as 12 in Crown Heights carrying .25-caliber
automatic pistols.
   The city's schools have been focal points of the new juvenile
violence. Following a recent rash of attacks on teachers, the
president of the city's teachers union demanded better schoolhouse
security.
   During the 1986-87 school year, 1,495 weapons _ ranging from
crossbows and martial arts weapons to zip guns and pistols _ were
taken from students.
   This year, the number of weapons taken from students is up about
10 percent _ 1,579 from the start of the school year to April 30 _
and in the last six months there have been at least a dozen
incidents in which students were injured by gunfire.
   The problem is forcing educators to suggest remedies that once
seemed extreme. Under sweeping new security procedures announced
Tuesday by Mayor Edward I. Koch and schools Chancellor Richard R.
Green, students who attack school workers would be expelled _
despite the state's compulsory education law.
   Metal detectors are going up at the doors of some schools, and
additional police patrols will guard the most crime-ridden schools.
   ``Putting in a metal detector alters the image of the school,''
said Bruce Irushalmi, director of the Board of Education's Office of
School Safety. But, he added, ``So do weapons.''
   Irushalmi and Ed Muir, head of the United Federation of Teachers'
safety committee, link the increase in weapons to an increase in
student drug trafficking.
   Children, largely immune to harsh court punishment, have been
used by drug gangs for years to steer customers, watch for the
police or work as couriers.
   In inner-city neighborhoods with few good jobs, teen-agers can
easily earn in a day or two what many adults make in a week.
   ``The amount of money made in these lower-level organizations is
just incredible,'' said Robert Strang, a spokesman for the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration's New York office.
   For example, an $11,000 kilogram of cocaine can be processed into
$250,000 worth of crack, said William Hopkins, supervisor of the
Street Research Unit of the state Division of Substance Abuse
Services.
   Police say drug rings increasingly are hiring children, mostly
boys in their early teens, to market their wares.
   To guard their investment, dealers pass out pistols _ frequently
small, inexpensive .25-caliber automatics called ``pea shooters'' by
drug dealers whose own weapon of choice is the powerful 9mm
automatic.
   ``If a kid is hired to sell crack off the corner ... he might get
ripped off,'' said Sheridan. ``It's a lot cheaper to give a kid a
gun than to lose your drugs.''
   ``With 35 vials of crack selling for $8 to $10, you're putting
$350 worth of drugs in the hands of a 13-year-old, and he's very
vulnerable,'' he said. ``So the dealers will give them a gun to
protect their interests.''
   Sheridan tries to make sense of what he sees each day on ghetto
streets.
   ``There's a great frustration with our young people today,'' he
said. ``The lifestyles that are presented to them _ the guy with the
gold chain, the guys with the BMWs _ these are the people they
emulate.''

   Six miners were pulled alive from a
mine shaft today, three days after an explosion trapped them in a
pocket of air deep underground. Rescuers, who had given up hope,
said there may be more survivors.
   ``It's a miracle,'' said Peter-Carl Ruehland, a spokesman for
Preussen Elektra, the company that owns the mine. The rescue came
with the help of a television crew's microphone that picked up
tapping sounds.
   In all, 57 miners were trapped in Wednesday's explosion at the
Stolzenbach coal mine. As of early today, 15 men were still missing
and 36 had been confirmed dead.
   The dramatic rescue sparked hopes for finding more survivors.
Officials said there were some indications that two more men may be
near the pocket of air more than 300 feet underground where the six
spent 65 hours.
   ``It's a faint hope but a supervisor said there were tracks of
two people who may also be in an area where they may have
survived,'' said Heinz Cramer, a board member of Preussen Elektra.
``We're stepping up the search.''
   He said about 200 workers were involved in the search in the town
of Borken 72 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   Rescue workers, some with tears in their eyes, broke into
applause as the exhausted but otherwise unhurt survivors were
brought to the surface in a special cage that had been lowered into
a shaft by a crane.
   ``Where is my Ahmet, where is my little Ahmet?'' were the first
words of supervisor Thomas Gepperth as he emerged.
   He was asking about Ahmet Batkan, a Turkish immigrant worker who
was lifted out before him.
   Gepperth, who led the Turk and the five Germans men to safety,
was the only one to walk rather than be carried on a stretcher.
   ``Everybody was making their last wills and testaments,''
Gepperth said. ``I told them they didn't have to.''
   Gepperth was interviewed by Hesse state television as he strode
to join his men. His brief remarks, taped early today, were
broadcast later in the day.
   Family members rushed to embrace the men, whose blackened faces
showed fatigue. They were put on stretchers and carried to a nearby
rescue station in the mine.
   As they were led in an ambulance to be examined by doctors at a
nearby hospitals, the miners waved and smiled wearily. Officials
said all six were later released and allowed to go home.
   The six men were found in a deadend tunnel about 330 feet long,
10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   Cramer said that when the group felt the shock wave of the blast
Wednesday, they ran toward an exit. But Gepperth, a veteran
36-year-old miner and a trained rescuer, realized they were running
into high concentrations of deadly carbon monoxide when he saw
another man stagger and run out of strength.
   Gepperth then turned the group in the other direction and
instructed them to be as calm as possible to conserve oxygen, Cramer
said.
   ``To the right and to the left of where they were, the levels of
carbon monoxide were rising,'' Ruehland said.
   The rescue came early today after work crews drilled an air shaft
in the north section of the mine, where officials believed most of
the remaining men were trapped.
   The rescuers planned to release carbon monoxide to facilitate the
search and were surprised when oxygen came out instead.
   A cord was extended to 230 feet, and a microphone was carefully
lowered in by rescue workers. It picked up distinct, regular tapping
sounds.
   The microphone also picked up voices for a brief period, but they
later disappeared, according to a description provided by Hesse
state radio and television.
   After more than three hours of digging, the rescue workers broke
into the air pocket and found the men.
   A man who identified himself as a brother-in-law of rescued miner
Egon Dehn told reporters at the scene that the survivors were
between 21 and 37 years old and belonged to a 15-man crew.
   Quoting Dehn, the man told reporters that after the explosion,
nine of the 15 tried to retrace their steps to reach safety, but the
other six went in an opposite direction and found an air pocket.
   In addition to Dehn, Gepperth and Batkan, a company spokesman
identified the survivors as Helmut Gesner, Heinz Roese and Wilfried
Doench.
   Rescue workers and state officials said on Thursday that they
believed no one could survive the high levels of poisonous carbon
monoxide gas inside the shaft.
   Wednesday's methane gas explosion rocked the ground like an
earthquake. The blast was West Germany's worst mining disaster in 26
years.
   Many of the miners whose bodies have been retrieved suffocated
from lack of air after their emergency breathing masks ran out of
oxygen, while others died from their injuries, officials said.
   The blast killed about one-third of the work force at the
Preussen Elektra mine. The company is the leading employer in Borken
and one of West Germany's largest utilities.
   Ruehland said the company would pay funeral costs and the costs
of flying the immigrant workers' bodies back to Turkey, if family
members requested it. Fourteen of the 57 trapped miners were Turkish.
   The Borken explosion is the worst West German mining accident
since 299 men died in 1962 at the Luisenthal mine in Saarland state
along the border with France.

<TEXT>
   Skirmishes over four U.S. Senate seats, a wide-open race for
Montana governor and a California potpourri of propositions
highlight the ballots in seven states Tuesday, the busiest state
primary day so far in 1988.
   In Newark, N.J., two black Democrats are competing for their
party's nomination to the congressional seat being vacated by Peter
Rodino after 40 years. In San Diego, Mayor Maureen O'Connor is
overwhelmingly favored to win election in a nonpartisan race to a
full four-year term.
   The California propositions include statewide measures that would
permit the quarantining of AIDS victims, ease the government
spending limits imposed by Proposition 13 a decade ago, and cap
runaway spending on political campaigns.
   In local measures of note, Sacramento voters could become the
first in the nation to close a nuclear power plant, the troubled
Rancho Seco facility; and voters in San Bernardino County _ the
nation's largest county _ will decide whether to carve away the
eastern, desert portion to create a new county called Mojave.
   The most hotly contested Senate primary is in New Mexico, where
four Republicans think first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman is
vulnerable because of his liberal voting record in a state that
strongly supports defense spending. State Sen. Bill Valentine and
longtime party activist Corky Morris have held the lead in polls for
the GOP nomination. Bingaman is unopposed in the Democratic primary.
   The only other first-term Democrat seeking re-election this year,
Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, faces a challenge from two
little-known primary opponents. He is gearing up for his November
clash with the unopposed GOP nominee, Peter Dawkins, a Heisman
Trophy winner, Rhodes scholar and Vietnam War hero who resigned from
the Shearson-Lehman brokerage house in New York City last year and
moved to New Jersey.
   The national GOP has targeted both Bingaman and Lautenberg, and
both states have Republican governors who will campaign for the
party's nominee.
   In California, Republican Sen. Pete Wilson has no primary hurdle
as he seeks a second term, but he will have to overcome a jinx in
November _ for more than 30 years, no one has been re-elected to
that particular Senate seat. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy faces two political unknowns.
   The fourth Senate race is in Montana, where Democrat John Melcher
is seeking the nomination for a third term. His only primary
challenger is attorney Robert Kelleher, who advocates a
parliamentary form of government. The unopposed GOP candidate is
Conrad Burns, a Yellowstone County commissioner and former
broadcaster.
   Montana also features a lively race for governor, a post held by
Democrats for 20 years. Two-term Gov. Ted Schwinden's decision not
to run for a third term gave Republicans hope of recapturing the
office, but their leading candidate, Secretary of State Jim
Waltermire, was killed in an April plane crash. The remaining GOP
contenders are former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal
Winslow.
   The six-man Democratic field includes a comeback bid by former
Gov. Thomas Judge, who lost to Schwinden in the 1980 primary. The
two other leading candidates are Attorney General Mike Greely, who
has a drunken driving conviction on his record, and former state
Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison Jr.
   Here is a look at the other states voting Tuesday:
   ALABAMA _ Democratic Reps. Claude Harris of Tuscaloosa and Bill
Nichols of Sylacauga are favored to turn back primary challenges.
   Races for three Alabama Supreme Court seats have turned into
unusually rough-and-tumble scraps in which big business and
insurance companies are backing one slate of Democratic candidates,
while trial lawyers and less conservative interests are backing
another slate. One of the candidates with trial lawyer support is
Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy of Montgomery, a son-in-law of former
Gov. George C. Wallace. He is running against Anniston lawyer A.W.
Bolt, who is supported by business lobbies, for an associate justice
post.
   IOWA _ Sixteen supporters of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche
are running in Democratic primaries, five for congressional
nominations and the rest in state legislative districts. Four
Democrats are seeking the nomination to oppose first-term GOP Rep.
Fred Grandy, who for years played Gopher on television's ``The Love
Boat.''
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ The state is having one of its quietest elections
in memory, with no statewide races on the ballot. And there are only
26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats. The
state's lone congressman, Democratic Rep. Tim Johnson, is unopposed
in the primary as is his Republican challenger, state Treasurer
David Volk.

<HEAD>Improved U.S.-Soviet Relations Could Benefit Democrats, Scholars
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's moves to ease tension in
U.S.-Soviet relations could backfire politically because voters not
worried about foreign affairs might end up backing Democrats, two
scholars said Saturday.
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis could gain
more from improved U.S. Soviet relations than Vice President George
Bush, the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee, the
scholars said.
   But if that happens, it would be only the second time since 1952
that the foreign policy issue has played into the hands of the
Democrats, William A. Galston and Christopher J. Makins wrote in the
lead article in the summer issue of Foreign Policy magazine.
   The other campaign was in 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson
steamrollered Barry Goldwater in part with a famous daisy-petal
advertisement and ``Moscow calling'' line portraying the
conservative Republican as a war-mongerer.
   Galston is a Democrat who was issues director for Walter Mondale
from 1982 to 1984 and who worked briefly as an adviser to Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., when Gore sought the Democratic
nomination. Makins is an independent and former director of
international security programs for the Roosevelt Center for
American Policy Studies. Galston is also a former Roosevelt Center
scholar.
   ``The history of modern presidential elections suggests that the
Republican candidate will be well advised to stress foreign policy,
while his Democratic counterpart should seek to focus public
attention on domestic concerns,'' they wrote.
   ``Concerns about U.S.-Soviet relations and arms control have
receded in the face of the dramatically improved atmosphere and the
solid progress at the negotiating table. The public is now more
worried about terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons to countries
that do not now have them, possible conflict in the Persian Gulf,
and the U.S. trade imbalance,'' they said. ``Demands for better
burden sharing with Western Europe and Japan have become staples of
the 1988 campaign rhetoric.''
   If the foreign policy debate focuses on these issues, ``Democrats
may have an opportunity to offset the advantage Republicans have
enjoyed on more traditional foreign policy issues.''
   Opinion polls and scholarly studies have concluded that American
voters are swayed less by foreign policy concerns than by domestic
issues, especially the state of the economy.
   But Galston and Makins said foreign policy can be ``crucial at
the margin, where it counts the most.''
   ``Foreign policy is, first and foremost, a prism through which
voters judge the basic soundness of a candidate to govern the
country,'' they said.
   Even though the Iran-Contra affair weakened public confidence in
the Republicans' stewardship of foreign affairs, polls still give
the Republicans an edge in this arena, the authors said.
   The article says both Bush and Dukakis could be saddled with
party platforms that turn voters off.
   In 1984, ``archconservative forces seized control of the
Republican platform process and drafted a document not entirely to
the White House's liking, especially with its allusions to fighting
and winning nuclear wars,'' it said.
   The Democrats face the prospect that Jesse Jackson and his
supporters will fight for platform stands on military spending, arms
control and the Middle East that ``might well antagonize swing
voters whose support will be critical to Democratic general election
prospects.''
   In 1984, the article notes, three of the five contested
Democratic platform planks dealt with foreign policy issues:
Jackson-sponsored minority reports on defense spending cuts and a
nuclear no-first policy, and a Gary Hart push for stringent limits
on committing U.S. troops to combat.
   ``The picture that emerged was of a liberal party significantly
divided on foreign policy and at risk of being tugged even further
to the left,'' the article said.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor with no foreign policy
experience, ``has faithfully represented the views of post-Vienam
Democrats who are skittish about the use of American force, opposed
to much of this decade's military buildup,'' it said.
   Such a stance ``has not fared well among conservative Democrats
and independents in past general elections,'' the authors said.
   Bush, former CIA director and envoy to China, may be able to
argue that Reagan's military build-up and Strategic Defense
Initiative have brought the Soviets back to the bargaining table and
``dissuaded the U.S.S.R. from advancing in the Third World.''
   But Bush's ties to Reagan also leave him ``in a relatively weak
position to exploit the electorate's frustration over trade, the
international drug trade, the U.S. `decline' overseas and the
allies' perceived failure to contribute fairly to the common
defense,'' it said.

<HEAD>Police Dog's Eye Surgery So Successful He May Return to Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police dog with eye cancer whose supporters
raised $5,000 when the city refused to pay for his surgery has come
through the operation so well, he may be able to return to active
duty, police said.
   Zeus, a 7-year-old German shepherd, returned home Friday with his
handler, Officer Mike Kendig, one day after undergoing surgery to
remove the cancerous eye at a Sacramento, Calif., animal hospital.
   He has been fitted with a temporary prosthesis and will go back
to Sacramento next month to be fitted with a permanent one, said
Sgt. Greg Dion, a police spokesman.
   Meanwhile, Zeus will return to training in about three weeks to
determine whether his other senses will compensate enough for the
loss of the eye to let him return to full-time police work, Dion
said.
   Zeus became a celebrity when it was reported the city would not
pay for the operation because he was taking early retirement. That
spurred a fund-raising effort that netted more than $1,000 in a few
hours and has reached nearly $5,000, according to police Capt. Jim
Weston.
   The city has since announced it will foot the entire $1,400 cost
of Zeus' operation and the prosthesis. The donations will be
refunded if people ask for their money back; the rest will be put in
a city fund earmarked for police dogs.

<HEAD>Reagan Renews Favorable Trade Status for China, Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Saturday renewed a grant of
favorable trade status to China and Hungary but allowed similar
status for Romania to lapse.
   The president's action continues in effect for 12 months a waiver
granted to the Chinese and Hungarian governments under legislation
passed in 1974. The legislation conditions ``most favored nation''
status on satisfactory immigration policies.
   Reagan said that he was permitting the waiver for Romania to
expire because Romania has renounced extension of the so-called
``most favored nation'' tariff treatment under the act.
   He said that the waivers have made it possible to maintain
bilateral trade agreements with the three countries and give U.S.
companies the ability to compete in those countries' markets.
   Hungary ``has continued to take a relatively positive and
constructive approach to emigration matters,'' the president said,
and China has a ``relatively liberal policy on emigration ....
reflected in the steadily rising number of immigrant visas issued by
our embassy and consulates in China.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Strike A Chord With Immigrant Son Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story of Panos Dukakis and Euterpe Boukis
is a classic tale of immigrants, a saga of poor Greeks who landed in
America with nothing and achieved through sheer effort a piece of
the dream.
   Michael Dukakis has carefully cultivated his image as an
immigrant son during his Democratic presidential campaign, an ethnic
portrayal rarely seen in his earlier days in public life.
   ``Seventy-five years ago, a young Greek man arrived in Manchester
from a town in western Asia Minor. He spoke very little English and
had about $25 in his pocket,'' Dukakis recalls on the stump.
   Panos, his father, worked in the mills and put himself through
college. He went on to Harvard Medical School, a rare educational
leap for an immigrant, and became a wealthy obstetrician. Euterpe,
his mother, arrived here at the age of 9, toiled in the textile
factories and became the first girl in her hometown to go to college.
   Dukakis is rightfully proud of his family, telling the story with
equal parts love, pride and political acumen. It is a tale certain
to strike a chord with melting-pot Americans.
   But critics say the governor never mentioned his ethnic roots
during the pre-presidential years and turned to them now only as a
campaign tactic to attract ethnic voters as well as build a huge
fund-raising base from the Greek community.
   ``I don't remember him ever mentioning it ... and I was listening
pretty carefully,'' said former Massachusetts Gov. Francis Sargent,
a liberal Republican who lost the 1974 election to Dukakis. ``I knew
he was a Greek, but he didn't trumpet it.''
   ``Although I think he was always aware and proud of his Greek
heritage, it was not something that has ever been intimately
connected with his politics,'' said Martin Linsky of Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government.
   To many Massachusetts voters, Dukakis was associated not with
first- and second-generation Americans, but with Harvard academics
and white-collar suburban liberals. He grew up in financial comfort,
graduated from Harvard Law School, and made his name in politics in
the 1960s as a leader of young politicians out to reform the state
Democratic Party, which was run largely by pols with a strong ethnic
affiliation. And his political base was Brookline, a predominately
Jewish upper-middle-class Boston suburb.
   Paul Brountas, long-time friend, fellow Greek and campaign
chairman, says Dukakis' ethnic emphasis helped identify him to a
national audience that knew little of the Massachusetts governor,
and helped him stand apart in the crowded Democratic field in the
early weeks of the campaign.
   ``When you're running nationally and when people don't know who
you are, you have to identify yourself, your values, your
background, before you get into issues,'' said Brountas. ``That's
not necessary to run for governor. He was very well known when he
ran for governor.''
   Brountas said the governor's 1976 trip to his parents' homeland
was a turning point, triggering deep feelings of ethnic pride.
   ``It made an impact on him. I remember one night (in Greece) we
were at a semi-formal government dinner with several dignitaries,''
Brountas recalled. ``He was asked to say a few words. He was quite
poignant, emotional. It was the first time I'd seen him talk about
his heritage that way.''
   Long-time Dukakis observers say hints of the immigrant son began
emerging publicly during his 1978 campaign, which he lost to Edward
King, and became more visible in 1982 as he successfully fought to
win back the governorship.
   A 1982 television advertisement _ which came to be known as the
``Zorba the Greek'' ad _ featured Dukakis standing in front of a
house his father lived in while saving money for school. With
traditional Greek music playing in the background, Dukakis spoke
about his father's life.
   ``What it did was give him a history,'' said Michael Goldman, a
Boston-based Democratic political consultant. Before that, Goldman
said, ``What did you know about Michael Dukakis? He was from
Brookline and he went to Harvard. ... The perception was he was sort
of a Yankee.''
   Dukakis' focus on his heritage never played such a central role
in his political life until his presidential bid.
   ``He's never had to reach down that deep before,'' said Linsky.
``It's an internal thing. It's never been necessary before. He's
never had to draw on his own roots as a personal and emotional
matter. He's always been able to achieve what he's achieved without
getting to that point. Running for president was a different
operation.''
   Dukakis' Greek ancestry helped him win votes on several fronts,
says Ralph Whitehead, a professor at the University of Massachusetts
at Amherst.
   ``It's helping him with ethnic voters, and I think it's regarded
by many voters in the Democratic Party, be them ethnic or otherwise,
as a sign that he's down to earth, even if he isn't necessarily
earthy,'' Whitehead said.
   And, Whitehead added, ``Dukakis' Greek identity gives him all the
advantages of the Ellis Island mystique and none of the
disadvantages'' that have shadowed some Italian-American politicians.
   ``In the eyes of the Democratic electorate, Dukakis has almost
the ideal form of ethnicity,'' said Whitehead. ``Dukakis has become
sort of generically ethnic.''

<HEAD>Summit Aftermath: Superpowers Still Far Apart on START</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moscow summit ended with the superpowers far
apart on a strategic arms reduction treaty and on an issue that will
become more important in months to come _ cuts in conventional
forces in Europe.
   Although hopes dimmed for a new arms treaty under President
Reagan, the news was not all bad.
   Both sides are still talking, rather than shouting as they did
early in the Reagan administration, and they are discussing more
issues more seriously than ever before.
   Perhaps the most important development that the summit showed,
and the one that is hardest to measure, is the growing role that
domestic political developments in the Soviet Union are playing in
superpower relations.
   Reagan, who built his political career as a Communist basher, was
impressed by the changes in Soviet policy under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, whom he called ``a serious man seeking serious reform.''
   `Quite possibly, we are beginning to take down the barriers of
the postwar era, quite possibly we are entering a new era in
history, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union,'' said
Reagan, who early in his term branded the Soviet Union, an ``evil
empire.''
   Within hours after Reagan left Moscow on Friday, Gorbachev
exhibited the harmonious summit in a political battle against
domestic opponents of his campaign of ``perestroika'' to reform the
Soviet economy.
   The Kremlin leader fought off a conservative attempt at a Moscow
Communist Party executive committee meeting to block prominent
reformers from attending an important national party conference
starting June 28.
   As Gorbachev looked on, one of his allies, Moscow party chief Lev
Zaikov, told opponents of reform that the summit marked ``a concrete
result of perestroika in foreign policy.''
   The change in Soviet political debate, while nowhere near as open
as the battles in the West, has been accompanied by a shift in the
nature of arms control negotiations. The superpowers are now
discussing deep cuts in new systems, unlike agreements of the 1960s
and 1970s, which limited rather than reduced arsenals.
   And the Soviets, for the first time, are willing to allow
Americans to make on-site inspections to monitor compliance with the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) pact signed last December
and ratified by the U.S. Senate last month.
   Reagan and Gorbachev shook hands over the INF pact at the summit,
and ended five days of intensive talks by declaring some progress on
two of five major obstacles to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START) to slash nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   But they did not clear the major hurdle to START: Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative plan for space-based defenses. And they
reported no progress on Soviet demands to limit the number of
sea-launched cruise missiles or U.S. demands that the Soviets phase
out their heavy SS-18 missiles.
   On conventional arms, there was a subtle hint of motion.
   A few hours after Reagan arrived in Moscow last Sunday, Gorbachev
proposed they exchange data on conventional forces to try to
eliminate ``asymmetries'' in the opposing forces. The Warsaw Pact
has more forces and NATO has more anti-tank guns.
   A senior U.S. official called Gorbachev's presentation ``a
restatement of past Soviet ideas rather than a proposal.''
   ``He just sort of moved some commas around'' on a 1986 proposal
for a 500,000-troop reduction in Warsaw Pact and NATO forces in
Europe, said the official, speaking on condition that he not be
identified.
   U.S. analysts said before the summit they anticipated Gorbachev
might announce unilateral cuts of 50,000 to 100,000 troops.
   But one Soviet spokesman rejected that.
   ``I would not be in favor of the idea of a unilateral cut,'' said
Sergei Plekhanov, deputy director of the Institute for the
USA-Canada. ``We have been making a lot of concessions.''
   Western politicians would like to see cuts in Warsaw Pact forces,
which they claim have an edge of 2-to-1 in tanks.
   The Soviet Union has, for the first time, accepted the NATO
argument that the Warsaw Pact has more tanks, but they argue that
the West has more attack aircraft and other forces.
   Gorbachev has been proposing that the two sides exchange
information about European forces. But the Americans insist that
conventional force negotiations can only take place in a forum
involving all the nations of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Thus the talks will be part of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, the successor to the Helsinki negotiations
that led the Soviet Union, in 1975, to promise to observe human
rights.
   Before his trip to Moscow, Reagan had accused the Kremlin of wide
human rights abuses _ blocking progress on conventional arms. But
now that Reagan has declared Gorbachev sincere in his reforms, the
Americans might be more inclined to enter into hard bargaining for
conventional forces reductions.
   Toning down U.S. criticism of human rights policy, said a senior
U.S. official, ``makes it a lot easier for Gorbachev to change his
policies.''
   And the West would like nothing better to see smaller
conventional armies in Europe and a better Soviet record on human
rights.

<HEAD>China Regulates Foreign Exhibitions Of Pandas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese government has announced new
regulations restricting the lending of giant pandas to foreign zoos,
the official Xinhua News Agency said Saturday.
   The move comes in response to environmentalist claims that China
is profiting from foreign exhibits of the endangered species.
   The Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens ruled that only
non-commercial exhibitions will be allowed and that no foreign
companies will be allowed to profit from showing the animals, Xinhua
said.
   Foreign zoos holding exhibitions will have to contribute funds or
technical assistance to the association for protecting pandas and
other rare animals, it said. Foreign exhibitions must also be
approved by the Chinese government.
   There are fewer than 1,000 pandas living in the wild, all in
remote areas of southwest China. About 60 pandas live in Chinese
zoos.
   In recent years, the Association of Zoological Gardens has loaned
pandas to zoos in North America, Europe and Japan. The zoos, assured
of increased revenues from the popular animals, have paid China
$500,000 and more for the right to borrow a panda pair.
   The World Wildlife Fund and the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums last month asked a U.S. district
court to halt shipment of two giant pandas who were to be put on
display in Toledo, Ohio as part of the city's 150th anniversary
celebration.
   The court rejected the suit.
   The Chinese association also announced tighter controls over the
lending of golden monkeys, another endangered species found in China.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French choose a new 577-seat National Assembly
on Sunday, four weeks after re-electing President Francois
Mitterrand, and are expected to give his Socialists a solid majority.
   The two-round election also is expected to spell doom for the
Communists and the far-right National Front in the lower house of
Parliament, where the legislative power lies.
   Mitterrand got 54 percent of the vote in the May 8 contest with
former Premier Jacques Chirac, the conservative presidential
candidate, and polls indicate a crushing victory for his party in
the Assembly elections.
   Late surveys indicated the Socialists would receive 42-44 percent
of the vote, compared with about 40 percent for the alliance of the
conservative Rally for the Republic and center-right Union for
French Democracy. Because of the French election formula, however,
that slim advantage could translate into majority of 100 seats or
more.
   Legislative elections in 1986 used a one-round proportional
system, with seats assigned on the basis of the percentage of votes
won by lists of candidates, but under the current system the winner
takes all.
   Candidates winning more than 50 percent of the vote Sunday are
elected.
   In districts where no candidate achieves 50 percent, a runoff
will be held June 12 among those with 12.5 percent or more in the
first round.
   The new system favors large parties and hurts smaller ones _ in
this case, the National Front and the Communists, each of which won
35 seats the last time.
   It appears certain both will fall well short of the 30 seats
needed to qualify as an official political group in the Assembly.
That is important because committee memberships, speaking time, time
on radio and television and other matters are decided on the basis
of political groups.
   Conservatives controlled the National Assembly from 1986 until
Mitterrand dissolved it after his re-election last month. They seem
to have accepted a return to opposition, while the Socialists appear
almost apologetic about their commanding position.
   Mitterrand said during his presidential campaign he wanted to
work with the existing National Assembly and open the Cabinet to
non-Socialists from the political center.
   New Premier Michel Rocard formed a government with no notable
presence from other parties, however, and Mitterrand called the
election.
   Socialists continued with the ``opening'' theme through the
campaign, but most politicians of the right and center-right view
the idea as little more than an invitation for them to become
Socialist.
   Rocard said even a Socialist landslide would not be fatal to the
``opening'' because ``we want to work with others.''
   Jean Lecanuet, president of the Union for French Democracy, had
this unenthusiastic comment: ``The Socialists should make their
policies known instead of talking ceaselessly of an opening, which
is a yawner.''
   The only concrete Socialist plan made public so far is for a
guaranteed minimum income to be financed in part by reviving the
special tax on large fortunes. The conservatives abolished it in
1986.
   Pierre Mehaignerie, a centrist leader who was an early object of
Socialist overtures, said in a final campaign plea: ``Experience has
shown that we were more effective in creating jobs, fighting
unemployment and creating riches.''
   He contended that accepting the Socialist ``opening'' would mean
``submission ... not constructive dialogue.''

   President Reagan said today his visit to Moscow
sowed ``seeds of freedom and greater trust'' that he believes will
take root and grow in ways yet unguessed.
   In his weekly radio address, the president reviewed his summit
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, from which he returned
on Friday after a stopover in London.
   Appearing rested after his first night back in the White House,
Reagan was seen walking from his residential quarters to the Oval
Office in a jogging outfit.
   Noting recent Soviet reforms, the president said, ``It is my hope
that what took place in my Moscow visit will lead to still greater
individual freedom for peoples in the Soviet Union.''
   ``If anyone had suggested even as recently as 10 years ago that
an American president would one day be able to meet with Soviet
dissidents inside Moscow itself, or be able to speak to Soviet
students in their own university about human freedom, well, I think
you'll agree that a prediction like that would have been
dismissed,'' Reagan said.
   ``But this past week, it happened,'' he added. ``Seeds of freedom
and greater trust were sown, and I just have to believe that, in
ways we may not even be able to guess, those seeds will take root
and grow.''
   ``Believe me, as far as Nancy and I are concerned, there's no
place like home,'' Reagan declared to a flag-waving crowd that
welcomed him Friday to Andrews Air Force Base outside the capital.
   Air Force One, carrying the Reagans from a post-summit stopover
where they met leaders in London, edged its nose into Hangar 3,
where Vice President George Bush and most members of the Cabinet
were waiting.
   Amid the greetings, an Air Force band blared, a 21-gun salvo rang
out and a crowd on folding chairs and bleachers cheered.
   ``We're a little tired but we're exhilarated at what has
happened,'' Reagan said in an address from a raised platform in the
center of the hangar. ``Exhilarated, too, at the thought of the
future and what may lie ahead for the young people of America and
all the world.
   ``The events of this week in Moscow were momentous. Not
conclusive perhaps, but momentous. And believe me, right now
momentous will do just fine.''
   He repeated his assertion that ``real progress'' was made on arms
control and human rights during his trip to Moscow and talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We made tangible progress toward an even more historic treaty
on strategic weapons, yes, a 50 percent reduction in nuclear
weapons,'' Reagan said.
   The arrival rally was the final, orchestrated event of more than
a week of presidential travel that included Reagan's flight to
Helsinki, Finland, for summit preparations last week, his days and
nights in Moscow and his visit with Britain's Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth.
   The State Department, meanwhile, sent Congress a report saying
that although human rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern European
countries remained ``seriously flawed,'' significant improvements
were made in the six months ending April 1.
   The Soviet leadership improved the ability of citizens to express
their views, released some political prisoners, increased emigration
and made progress in reuniting families divided between the United
States and the Soviet Union, the report said.
   On the other hand, it said, there appeared to be less tolerance
of demonstrations. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, there also has ben a
mixed bag of improvements and continued repression, the report said.
   As Reagan flew back to Washington, his national security adviser,
Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, said U.S.-Soviet relations are in good shape.
   ``It is solidly in place without a lot of ups and downs, without
too many sharp turns that cause people to have anxiety,'' Powell
told reporters on Air Force One.
   ``It is a fairly stable, maturing, growing relationship and I
think it's a relationship that will be built on by the next
administration regardless of which party wins the election in the
fall,'' he added.
   Though the superpowers still have major differences on terms of a
strategic arms reduction treaty, Powell said: ``We have to take this
slowly. This is too important to rush.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said Friday in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp. that she believed Gorbachev would persist in
trying to reform the Soviet system.
   ``I do get this feeling from Mr. Gorbachev he's not going to be
off-put by the difficulties,'' she said. ``He has a vision of the
possibilities and the opportunities and he's going to go through
with it.
   British opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who advocates
unilateral disarmament and who describes Mrs. Thatcher as ``Reagan's
poodle,'' praised Reagan in an Independent Television News interview.
   ``He deserves very full credit from our generation and from
future generations for making a positive response to Gorbachev's
initiatives,'' Kinnock said.
   White House aide Mark Rosenker said 4,000 invitations to the
welcome-home ceremonies were sent to members of the Republican
National Committee, Congress, appointed officials in the executive
branch and military personnel in the Washington area. Reporters
estimated at least 3,000 people showed up.
   The White House arranged for more than two dozen 7th graders on a
Washington field trip from the Drane Middle School in Corsicana,
Texas, to attend the arrival. They made a noisy cheering section to
the side of the podium.
   Welcoming signs, including one that read, ``another one for the
gipper,'' and one that said ``there you go again,'' were distributed
throughout the crowd.
   Except for Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, all of
whom were out of town, the Cabinet lined a red carpet leading from
the plane to the podium to greet the Reagans.
   ``Welcome home and well done,'' Bush said. He lauded Reagan for
raising human rights issues ``in the heart of the Kremlin.''
   ``What's wrong with telling the other guy how you feel,'' Bush
said of Reagan's discussions with Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Indian Troop Withdrawal May Begin Within Days, Reports Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India may soon begin withdrawing some
of the 50,000 troops it sent to Sri Lanka over the past 10 months to
enforce an Indian-brokered peace accord, press reports said Saturday.
   The United News of India quoted officials at the Indian High
Commission _ or embassy _ in Colombo as saying the withdrawal of the
troops could begin as early as Tuesday. It did not identify the
officials.
   A report to be published Sunday in the government-owned Sunday
Observer newspaper and made available to The Associated Press said
the Indian army's tank and artillery units will be withdrawn this
week.
   An independent Sinhalese newspaper, the Sunday Divaniya, said
that as many as 8,000 Indian troops may be pulled back from Sri
Lanka starting early next week.
   But Nirupam Sen, deputy Indian High Commissioner in Colombo, told
The AP that no time has been set for a pullout.
   ``Some equipment and troops that are not necessary will be sent
back, but we are still finalizing the exact time,'' said Sen.
   Indian Defense Minister K.C. Pant told reporters during a visit
Tuesday that Indian forces will begin withdrawing ``in the near
future,'' but he gave no specific date.
   Indian began sending troops to Sri Lanka on July 30, a day after
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Junius
R. Jayewardene signed a peace accord aimed at ending a five-year
insurgency by the island's minority Tamils.
   India is the dominant power in the region and its 60 million
ethnic Tamils are sympathetic to their Sri Lankan brethren.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and
military.
   Militant Tamils have waged a guerrilla war since 1983 for more
political autonomy or an independent homeland in the north and east
of the island, where most Tamils live.
   The accord called for the Tamil rebels to lay down their arms in
exchange for political concessions, such as the creation of district
councils with control over education, law enforcement and land
distribution _ all now handled by the federal government.
   But the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and most
extreme of the rebel groups, rejected the pact.
   India, which initially sent about 6,000 troops to the island,
increased its manpower and launched a major offensive against the
Tigers last October to drive them out of the northern Jaffna
Peninsula. Since May 23, the Indian forces have been conducting
search-and-destroy missions against Tiger bases around the eastern
port town of Mullaitivu.
   Indian officials have said that 36 Tamil rebels and 10 Indian
soldiers have been killed in the latest fighting. India said Friday
that 18 Indian soldiers also died when a mine exploded under their
truck earlier in the week just west of the battle area.
   At least 480 Indian soldiers have died during the 10 months the
troops have been on the island. No official figures are available on
Tamil rebel deaths, but unofficial estimates have put them over
1,000. More than 8,000 people are believed to have died since the
Tamil insurgency began.

   A city-owned television station accidentally
broadcast a video of a topless woman during a program for young
people intended to discourage teen-age pregnancy and drug abuse.
   ``They flubbed and they're very contrite,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch
said of the incident, which occurred about 4:20 p.m. Friday on WNYC.
``They don't allow this kind of nudity for adults. They would not
intentionally put this show on a children's hour.''
   ``They say a producer fell asleep at a switch,'' Koch said
Saturday. ``The producer is supposed to screen them.''
   The New York Post reported the incident in its Saturday editions.
   Koch said it wasn't known how the clip got into the pre-recorded

   ``There's no liability here. It's a mistake. We're not going to
hang anybody,'' said Koch. ``The producer who works for WNYC is
ultimately responsible.''
   Asked if the unidentified producer would be disciplined, Koch
replied, ``He'll be told, `Stop sleeping.'''
   The program, ``Video Music Box,'' reaches hundreds of thousands

Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rescuers pulled one gold miner to
safety, but there was little hope Saturday of saving at least 27
others buried when a maze of crudely dug tunnels and shafts caved in
after heavy rains.
   The survivor brought to the surface late Friday was taken to a
hospital in Dipalog, about 450 miles southeast of Manila. His left
leg was so badly injured that doctors had to amputate it, an
official said. The survivor was not identified.
   Benito Tolentino, mayor of the town of Sibutad, told reporters
that the cave-in occurred in a network of tunnels on the slopes of
Mount Lablab after two days of heavy rain softened the soil.
   He said 28 people were working in the area, which is below a
45-foot-deep shaft, when the surface collapsed.
   Tolentino said rescuers in Sibutad, about 30 miles from Dipalog,
were armed only with picks and shovels and were having difficulty
reaching the trapped miners.
   He said there was little hope that any of them were still alive.
   Tolentino ordered a temporary halt to any more gold prospecting
at the site.
   About 20,000 prospectors from different parts of Mindanao island
have converged on the mountainside since gold was discovered last
September, Tolentino said.
   He said at least 12 people had been killed in previous cave-ins.
   As in many other ``gold rush'' areas on Mindanao, prospectors
often burrow into mountains without any professional supervision.
Authorities in Manila estimate that hundreds of people have been
killed in such cave-ins, with many of them unreported.
   Armed only with picks and shovels, the miners dig deep into the
earth and haul dirt out in bags. Other workers then sift gold
nuggets and gold dust by washing off the dirt in streams using
wooden pans.

<HEAD>Though Short on Tangible Advances, Summit Produces Mood of Good
Will</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has emerged from his fourth
superpower summit with little to show for it on paper. But he
appears to have persuaded a longtime adversary he is sincere in his
pledge to build a new relationship with the West.
   President Reagan, in what was most probably his last U.S.-Soviet
summit, took back his notorious characterization of the Soviet Union
as an ``evil empire'' and heralded the beginning of ``a new era in
history, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union.''
   Though short on tangible achievement, the latest talks between
Reagan and Gorbachev produced a mood of good will and talk of mutual
interest. ``Momentous,'' Reagan called it.
   From their first meeting, in 1985, came ``the spirit of Geneva,''
in which the two great nuclear powers took a tentative step toward
each other after years of cold stares and bluster.
   In Reykjavik, Iceland, the following year, they rushed toward a
disarmament pact, finding agreement on broad statements of
principle. But the meeting collapsed in disappointment felt 'round
the world when the two leaders hit an impasse over the future of
``Star Wars.''
   Washington, last December, saw the triumphant signing of the
first treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons, those
borne by medium- and shorter-range missiles, and both sides looked
forward to even greater achievement in Moscow. There, both sides
said, they hoped the two leaders could sign an agreement to cut
their long-range nuclear arsenals in half.
   As at Reykjavik, however, they stumbled again over ``Star Wars,''
Reagan's visionary program to develop a space-based defense against
nuclear attack. But this time, neither side seemed particularly
disappointed.
   As he welcomed the American president to the Kremlin, Gorbachev
told Reagan, ``It is better to see once than to hear a hundred
times.'' And for Reagan, his first visit to the Soviet Union
certainly was an eye-opener.
   After building a political career on staunch anti-communism and
opposition to practically every accord between the two superpowers,
Reagan returned home convinced that the reforms Gorbachev is trying
to implement will change the character of the United States' Cold
War enemy.
   ``The events of this week in Moscow were momentous,'' he said.
``Not conclusive, perhaps, but momentous. And believe me, right now,
momentous will do just fine.''
   A senior American official, who has watched the pitch and yaw of
U.S.-Soviet relations for many years, said Reagan's conversations
with Gorbachev appeared to break down the Soviet leader's typically
Russian suspicion about his guest's intentions.
   ``He is more convinced, not just intellectually but in the gut,
that the American people do not really represent a threat,'' the
official said of Gorbachev.
   Reagan said that he found Gorbachev ``different than previous
Soviet leaders.'' As for the ``evil empire,'' he said, that was
``another time, another era.'' Reagan used the term to describe the
Soviet Union in March 1983, two years before Gorbachev rose to power.
   ``We must not stop here,'' Reagan said after his fourth and final
day of summit talks.
   And Gorbachev told a news conference the same day that it is
``vitally necessary'' that superpower summitry continue, albeit
probably with the retiring president's successor.
   Both sides seemed prepared to look beyond their problems with a
new arms accord to continue building bridges for improved
understanding.
   ``Let us look at one another with open eyes; let us see each
other's history, traditions and values,'' Gorbachev said. ``Let us
respect each other's choice, respect our peoples.''
   Reagan, too, sensed a change not just at the negotiating table
but in national attitudes.
   ``Quite possibly, we are beginning to take down the barriers of
the postwar era,'' he said. ``Quite possibly we are entering a new
era in history, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union.''
   Even on human rights issues, which at one point appeared to
threaten the cooperative spirit, Gorbachev appeared willing to seek
new approaches, and Reagan muted his criticism by blaming the Soviet
bureaucracy for the slow pace of Jewish emigration.
   ``The American administration does not have an understanding of
the real situation with human rights, with the processes that are
taking place in our country in the sphere of democracy.'' the Soviet
leader told reporters. ``Probably we, too, do not have a clear
understanding of the American situation in this sphere of life.''
   He said he suggested to Reagan that the two nations hold a
lawmakers' seminar to exchange views on the subject.
   He also praised his own country's press for reporting on Reagan's
meeting with dissidents and Jews who have been refused permission to
leave the country.
   ``This part of the president's visit had to be shown to our
people,'' he said. ``The people should know everything.''
   Because Soviet television carried some of the summit events live,
the people did see and hear much more about American conduct and
U.S. policy than is normally available to them. Some even got a
taste of Western news programming when they discovered they could
pick up Cable News Network broadcasts, which were beamed into Moscow
for officials and journalists during the summit.
   As for a new strategic arms reduction treaty, Reagan's national
security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, indicated that is just a
matter of time.
   ``We have to take this slowly,'' he said. ``This is too important
to rush.''
   In the meantime, Powell said, the relationship between the United
States and the Soviet Union ``is solidly in place without a lot of
ups and downs, without too many sharp turns that cause people to
have anxiety.''
   ``It is a fairly stable, maturing, growing relationship,'' he
added, ``and I think it's a relationship that will be built on by
the next administration, regardless of which party wins the election
in the fall.''
   Gorbachev suggested that the real key to the future lies in
developing economic ties between the two nations, not just in
formulating acceptable treaty language on reducing weaponry.
   ``The more we depend on each other economically,'' he said, ``the
more we will be predictable on the political plane.''

   Rainstorms Saturday broke a heat wave
that killed at least 450 people in New Delhi and the northern states
of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana in the past week.
   The weather service said the temperature in the capital dropped
from 100 to 82 degrees after the rain began.
   Light showers and a 7-degree drop in temperature were reported in
Rajasthan, which had been hardest hit by the unrelenting sun.
   Heavy rains were reported in neighboring Punjab and Haryana
states, where high winds took down trees and power lines near the
joint state capital of Chandigarh, the United News of India said.
   The death toll in Rajasthan from a week of intense heat rose to
393 Saturday with 11 more deaths reported, the news agency said.
   At least 60 other deaths from sunstroke and other heat-related
illnesses were reported through the week in other northern states.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union made ``significant
improvements'' in human rights in the past half year, though the
well-publicized drive for freedom faltered on some fronts, the State
Department said Saturday in a major report to Congress.
   The department criticized what it called a crackdown on
demonstrations, complained that rights activists' telephones were
disconnected and said the government-controlled press wrote
distorted accounts of the protests.
   Rights performance in Poland, East Germany, Romania and other
East bloc countries was also a mixed bag of old-style repression and
new progress, according to the 137-page document.
   Before being made public, the report was distributed to members
of Congress Friday as President Reagan returned from the Moscow
summit. But dissemination apparently was timed to meet a June 3
deadline set by legislation calling for the report, not to add
substance to the human rights concerns expressed by Reagan during
his week of summitry,
   After the United States signed the 1975 rights pact at the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Congress asked the
department to report twice a year on whether the Eastern Europeans
were complying with the bargain.
   The result, until Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev arrived on the
scene in 1985, has been a pile of reports filled with detailed,
distressing, evaluations of the human condition in Eastern Europe,
including accusations of widespread failure to comply with pledges
to grant freedom of assembly, religion, speech, association,
emigration and travel.
   The latest survey, covering the six month period after Oct. 1,
1987, said ``although many aspects of Soviet and East European
implementation of CSCE commitments in the areas of human rights and
economic cooperation remain seriously flawed, there have been
significant improvements in a number of areas.''
   On the positive side were increased emigration, the release of
some prisoners from labor camps, relaxed rules on travel abroad by
Soviet citizens and _ best of all, the report said _ the continued
tolerance of unofficial groups and new freedom to publish tracts
ranging from criticism of the government to George Orwell's ``Animal
Farm.''
   ``The limits of what was permissible to print continued to
expand, and public discussion of problems became more frank,'' the
report said.
   On the negative side, ``Soviet performance in the field of human
rights deteriorated in some areas compared to the last reporting
period,'' the report said.
   Between 250 and 450 political or religious prisoners remain in
jail, and restrictions on religion continue.
   The most detailed criticism touched on Soviet handling of public
protests.
   ``The authorities cracked down on demonstrations, taking
extraordinary measures to prevent them or stop them as soon as they
started,'' the report said. ``In another apparent retreat from
previous progress, Soviet authorities disconnected the telephones of
some human rights activists and selectively interfered with
telephone service in order to prevent undesired conversations.''
   Here are some highlights of the reports on other Eastern European
countries:
   _Romania: All freedoms remain sharply limited, including
Romania's particular discrimination against ethnic minorities. An
amnesty declared by President Nicolae Ceausescu to honor his 70th
birthday ``resulted in the release of an unprecedented number of
prisoners.''
   _Poland: The government continues to permit a ``relatively free''
intellectual life, but during the reporting period, authorities
banned an independent discussion club in Gdansk and harassed
participants in independent political and union activities.
   _Hungary: The country continued to hold a reputation for being
the least repressive of the Warsaw Pact countries. An increase in
contact between senior Western visitors and the Hungarian opposition
was a ``notably positive development'' during the reporting period.
   _East Germany: All rights are limited, but progress was seen in
the increase of travel rights, in allowed importation of some
foreign literature, and in a slight indication of better
church-state communication.
   _Czechoslovakia: The report on this country was as gloomy as
ever. Repression of a March 25 civil rights demonstration in
Bratislava was the ``most serious known'' example of abuse.
   _Bulgaria: It remained a tightly controlled society. Despite an
agreement with Turkey to discuss human rights problems, there
appears to be no letup in discrimination against the Turkish
minority in Bulgaria.

   White foreigners are training Karen ethnic
insurgents fighting the central Burmese government, official Burmese
media said Saturday.
   A television program showed a photograph of a mustachioed
Caucasian training soldiers of the Karen National Union in the use
of a rocket launcher. He was identified only as an ``unnamed
foreigner.''
   The photograph was among documents seized from the rebel group
after a clash with government troops May 30 in eastern Burma, the
television report said.
   A few foreign mercenaries, including some from France and
Australia, are known to have provided training to the Karens, one of
several ethnic minority groups fighting for greater independence
from the central government.
   The report said documents seized showed some foreigners had given
weapons training to the rebels at Manapler, Mela and Wanghka, three
major Karen strongholds.
   The documents were seized after a Karen rocket attack on Pa-an,
the capital of Karen State. Two people were killed and 11 others
wounded, according to government accounts.

   Former Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb,
nominated by acclamation for the U.S. Senate, was shouted down
during his acceptance speech Saturday by Democratic convention
delegates who support Jesse Jackson's presidential candidacy.
   Robb was briefly surrounded by Jackson supporters as he walked
down the center aisle of the convention hall to make his speech,
amid shouts of ``Jesse.''
   About midway through his speech, 60 Jackson supporters began
shouting again. Robb continued speaking for a few minutes until the
dissidents made their way toward the platform. By then, they were
surrounded by Robb supporters shouting the former governor's name.
   ``Whoever said Democrats didn't have any life left in them?'' an
obviously exasperated but still smiling Robb said. He then quit
speaking.
   Saturday's floor incident came on the heels of a Friday meeting
between Robb and Virginia leaders of Jackson's campaign. The
session, which lasted more than an hour, was held in an effort to
settle complaints that Robb has not supported Jackson for a position
in likely nominee Michael Dukakis' White House bid.
   Robb, asked what the Jackson supporters wanted him to do, said,
``I'm not real certain.''
   Convention delegates voted down a floor motion to open debate on
allocating the party's 75 national convention delegates, 37 of which
went to Jackson, 22 to former candidate Albert Gore Jr. and 16 to
Dukakis. The three-way split reflects the outcome of the Super
Tuesday primary in Virginia.

   A book about AIDS from a small, gay publishing
house is being offered free to the public this month at bookstores
around the country in what one promoter hailed as a unique joint
effort by the publishing industry.
   The 126-page volume titled ``You Can Do Something About AIDS''
contains 35 short chapters written by such celebrities as Elizabeth
Taylor, Whoopi Goldberg and Abigail Van Buren, who writes ``Dear
Abby.''
   It was published as a ``pro bono'' book with the help of
publishing houses and companies like the Book-of-the-Month Club,
Random House, Bantam Books, Simon and Schuster and Waldenbooks.
   ``It's absolutely unprecedented,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds,
D-Mass., who helped the book along by contacting some publishing
companies. ``Nobody's been able to pull together the publishing
industry like this before _ much less for a free book.''
   One group of authors concentrated on ways to ``get started'' in
the effort to stop AIDS. Other sections deal with ways to fight
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and help victims of the disease,
a deadly crippling of the body's immune system.
   One of the most moving contributions is from Olympic diving
champion Greg Louganis, who since 1984 has been a friend of
17-year-old AIDS victim Ryan White of Cicero, Ind., who caught the
disease from infected blood products he took for hemophilia.
Louganis' chapter is titled ``Be a Buddy'' and encourages people to
make contact with AIDS victims and build friendships.
   ``The thing I respect most about Ryan is that someone in his
position could be very angry or bitter. But he isn't,'' writes
Louganis. ``In spite of his own difficulties, he's trying to help
others. ... There's no reason to delay making contact and letting
someone know you care.''
   ``You Can Do Something About AIDS'' is the brainchild of
36-year-old Sasha Alyson, the owner of Alyson Publications in
Boston. He started his company 11 years ago.
   Inspiration for the project came from the grief of losing 35
friends to AIDS, he said.
   ``I started making a list once about (who had died) and I just
didn't want to finish it,'' Alyson said last week. ``At first you
think it's going to go away or get better and it doesn't. It gets
worse.''
   During an interview at Alyson Publications in Boston's South End,
Alyson said he was naive when first planning the book last year.
   ``I started out with all this confidence,'' he said. ``I thought
people would think it was a great idea and would agree. But I
quickly found out that people quickly found ways to say no.''
   Alyson said he initially encountered difficulty when contacting
publishing companies and celebrities. He made four attempts to reach
Elizabeth Taylor before one of her assistants got word to her and
she agreed to write an introduction to the book. Miss Van Buren
first declined to contribute but then agreed, he said.
   ``I went from being very confident to rock bottom very quickly,''
he said. ``At one point I wanted to cancel the project.''
   Even Studds said he was skeptical about the project.
   ``I was really touched by the idea but I had my doubts too that
it would succeed,'' he said.
   Alyson said he was consumed by the book all year. Now that it has
become reality, he hopes it will inspire the general public to join
the effort to fight the AIDS epidemic.
   ``The book will be most useful to those who didn't think AIDS
would affect them but suddenly they realize it's closer to home than
they thought,'' said Alyson.
   Kathy Weinkle, who runs the Buddenbrooks bookstore in Boston with
her brother, Martin, said the response to ``You Can Do Something
About AIDS'' has been better than expected.
   ``It's doing phenomenally well,'' she said. ``We have to
continuously refill the display. Almost everyone takes one. People
are making very positive comments.''

<HEAD>Church to Regain Cathedrals in Oldest Monastery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MASHA HAMILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cathedrals in the nation's oldest monastery will be
returned to the Russian Orthodox Church next week after 27 years of
state ownership, symbolizing progress in religious freedom,
officials announced Saturday.
   Parts of the Monastery of the Caves have become museums and will
remain in government hands. The monastery was established in 1050 on
the banks of the Dneiper River in Kiev, capital of the Ukraine,
where Christianity arrived 1,000 years ago in what now is the Soviet
Union.
   About 100 buildings are on the monastery grounds, which are
dotted with caves in which religious leaders and early princes of
Kiev were buried.
   Church and state officials made the announcement at the Danilov
Monastery in Moscow on the eve of weeklong festivities commemorating
the Christian millenium in this officially atheistic state.
   Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios, spiritual leader of the world's
180 million Eastern Orthodox Christians, is boycotting the
celebrations because of a dispute with the Russian church over
authority. His headquarters are in Istanbul, Turkey.
   Pope John Paul II is sending a Vatican delegation led by his
secretary of state, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, that includes nine
other cardinals.
   President Reagan visited Danilov last Monday and urged the
government to ease restrictions on religion.
   Metropolitan Tikhon, head of the monastery, indicated some
disappointment with Reagan's stop there. He told a news conference
the visit was intended as a peaceful, friendly gesture, but was
``short.''
   ``He only visited one temple,'' Tikhon said. ``He delivered a
speech. He had no chance to meet many people, so it is difficult to
assess its impact.''
   Reagan was in Moscow for his fourth summit with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.
   Since the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, tens of thousands of
churches have been destroyed or converted to government use, and
priests have been exiled or killed. Dictator Josef Stalin limited
the activities of those houses of worship allowed to remain open.
   About 90 million Soviet people follow religious faiths, however,
and the government is reconsidering its restrictions. As a sign of
the change, it has participated in organizing celebrations of the
millenium, which begin Sunday.
   Nationalization of the Monastery of the Caves in 1961 began a
long period of protest by church leaders. They raised the issue most
recently in an April meeting with Gorbachev.
   Metropolitan Pitirim, a ranking Russian Orthodox official, told
the Danilov news conference Friday the cathedrals at Kiev will be
returned to the church in a ceremony Tuesday.
   ``We are happy to be benefiting from this new climate in our
country,'' he told The Associated Press. ``We hope this will develop
and lead to the reopening of additional churches.''
   Yuri Shmirnov of the Religion Ministry said the decision was
``one of the most important we have made.''
   ``This is part of the government's reforms,'' he told the AP.
``You cannot exclude the church from real democratization. This
shows we are looking to the needs of the church.''

<HEAD>Italy Agrees To Accept U.S. Planes Spain Rejecting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Italian government on Saturday agreed to a NATO
request to accept 72 U.S. fighter planes being evicted from Spain.
   Defense Minister Valerio Zanone said the government deemed it
important that the planes remain in Europe to protect the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's southern flank. He said moving them
to Italy was the ``only suitable solution'' to keeping the wing in
service and avoiding an act of ``unilateral disarmament.''
   The United States, under an accord reached in January with Spain,
must remove the F-16s from the Torrejon air base near Madrid by
1991. The planes make up the U.S. Air Force's 401st Tactical Fighter
Wing. The Pentagon has said it would have to disband the unit unless
a final decision on moving them to another European base was made by
August.
   Zanone said there was no reason for the concern over the transfer
expressed by the Warsaw Pact, since NATO was only establishing a new
``peacetime base.'' The F-16s can carry nuclear weapons, but Zanone
emphasized they will be armed only with conventional weapons.
   Warsaw Pact countries are concerned that their territorial
airspace could come within range of the aircraft when the planes are
moved from Spain to Italy.
   The Italian government has reportedly been considering several
sites in southern Italy as possible bases for the F-16s, but Zanone
said no decision has been reached yet.
   Zanone said NATO will meet the entire cost of relocating the
planes, estimated at about $500 million.
   Italy's decision, made at a Cabinet meeting presided over by
Christian Democrat Premier Ciriaco De Mita, had been expected
following the formal request to Italy by NATO defense ministers in
Brussels on May 26.
   At that time, Lord Carrington, the alliance secretary-general,
said the planes represent ``a considerable portion of our strength
in the southern region.''
   Italian government officials have said the transfer of the F-16s
would be examined by Parliament later this month but that a vote
would likely not be needed.
   The Communists, Italy's second-largest party, immediately
criticized the decision. Aldo Tortorella, a party leader, denounced
what he called the government's haste in deciding and its lack of
``national dignity.''
   But Deputy Premier Gianni De Michelis, whose Socialist Party had
previously expressed some doubts about the transfer, told reporters
that the decision was taken with the support of all coalition
partners. De Mita's coalition of his Christian Democrats together
with Socialists, Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals commands
a comfortable majority in both houses of Parliament.
   De Michelis said his party hoped that East-West negotiations to
reduce armaments would be successful and make the relocation
unnecessary but that in the meantime, Italy should not take what
amounted to ``an act of unilateral disarmament.'' He and other
politicians pointed to the U.S. cruise missiles installed in Comiso,
Sicily, which will now be removed as a result of the U.S.-Soviet
treaty on medium-range nuclear weapons.

   Presbyterians should become more active in
politics and should even consider civil disobedience to fight the
spread of nuclear weapons, a proposed statement of doctrine for the
nation's largest Presbyterian denomination says.
   The paper, ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' is expected
to be the main topic of discussion this week as the 3 million-member
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) starts a year-long bicentennial
celebration with its 200th General Assembly in St. Louis.
   In addition to the peace paper, the 630 commissioners, or
delegates, will elect denominational officers and discuss a variety
of other social and church issues. The meeting opens Tuesday with
initial committee reports and an evening communion service, and runs
through June 15.
   ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' written last year by a
task force of 17 theologians, pastors and lay people, is an attempt
to answer conservatives' criticism of an earlier study paper that
took a stronger stand in favor of disobedience, said the Rev. Albert
C. Winn, who co-chaired the task force.
   ``This was our response to the charge that the first paper was
producing warfare in the church and was going to divide the
church,'' Winn said.
   ``We were leaning over backwards to make clear that there is room
in the church'' for disagreement, he said.
   The paper paints a picture of a world where children die of
hunger while money goes to build ``more devastating, more accurate,
more invulnerable, `smarter' and `cleaner' weapons.''
   Dissenters must think carefully before refusing to cooperate with
government authority in such things as paying taxes to support the
military, the paper says. But ``because of the extraordinary and
unprecedented nature of the current situation, cooperation with and
obedience to duly constituted human authority should not be a matter
of course.''
   ``The decision to cooperate should be as agonizing and as
carefully undertaken as the decision to resist,'' the paper says. It
called on Presbyterians who opt not to resist authority to support
those who do.
   During the General Assembly, a committee will discuss the paper
and report back to the full group. The committee's recommendation
are tentatively scheduled to be presented June 14, the next-to-last
day of the meeting.
   The paper also recommended that the church and its members take a
more active role in politics and the ``public media,'' and that
parents refuse to purchase ``war toys'' for children.
   Conservatives within the denomination had complained the earlier
study paper, titled ``Presbyterians and Peacemaking: Are We Now
Called To Resistance?'' advocated tax resistance and civil
disobedience to the exclusion of other methods of expression. And
some say the second report is not much better.
   ``The only real change (from the earlier paper) is tactical,''
said the Rev. Paul F. Scotchmer, executive director of Presbyterians
for Democracy and Religious Freedom, a conservative group. ``Instead
of calling outright for all Presbyterians to withhold `war taxes'
and engage in other forms of resistance to the U.S. government ...
the new document merely asks the entire church to throw its support
behind those who do.''
   The paper condemns the theory of nuclear deterrence _ that the
existence of nuclear weapons helps prevent war because each side
knows such a war would destroy it.
   ``The moral case for nuclear deterrence, even as an interim
ethic, has been undermined by unrelenting arms escalation,'' the
paper says.
   ``Having declared nuclear deterrence immoral, we must exercise
our individual corporate influence to effect a change in national
policy as rapidly as possible.''
   The denomination was formed in 1983 through a merger of the
United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.). The two bodies had split during the Civil War.
   The church has headquarters in both Atlanta and New York, but
will move its general offices to Louisville, Ky., this summer.

   President Reagan said Saturday his Moscow
summit visit sowed ``seeds of freedom and greater trust'' that he
hopes will lead to increased liberty for the Soviet people.
   ``I just have to believe that, in ways we may not even be able to
guess, those seeds will take root and grow,'' the president said in
his weekly radio address from the Oval Office.
   Wearing a jogging outfit, the president appeared relaxed and
rested after his first night in the White House since he left May 25
on his pilgrimage to Helsinki, Finland; Moscow; and London.
   Reagan also said that he and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
had ``moved ahead on ... negotiations that would lead to a dramatic
reduction in both sides' arsenals of strategic nuclear arms.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, in the
Democratic response to the president's speech, warned against
rushing such a treaty through _ something Reagan has said he will
not do.
   ``With arms control agreements, the devil is always in the
details,'' Byrd said. ``That's why it would be unwise to rush
negotiations.''
   ``Headline-grabbing summits are one thing,'' he said. ``But
rushing to meet a deadline on a treaty ... would be irresponsible.''
   Furthermore, Byrd said, ``I do not believe it would be wise to
lock the next president into a hasty agreement, be he a Republican
or a Democrat.''
   Reagan, in his address, said that ``the event that held perhaps
the most immediate historic importance'' during the summit was when
he and the Soviet leader signed the legal instruments putting into
effect their earlier treaty banning land-based intermediate- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   ``These missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the
map or placed in storage; they will have been destroyed,'' he said.
   He also said that he and Gorbachev agreed that the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan ``could serve as a model for settling
other regional conflicts.''
   Turning to one of the most contentious issues of the summit, the
president said, ``Recently the Soviets have begun to show somewhat
more respect for human rights.''
   ``It is my hope that what took place in my Moscow visit will lead
to still greater individual freedom for the peoples of the Soviet
Union,'' he said.
   ``If anyone had suggested even as recently as 10 years ago that
an American president would one day be able to meet with Soviet
dissidents inside Moscow itself, or be able to speak to Soviet
students in their own university about human freedom, well, I think
you'll agree that a prediction like that would have been
dismissed,'' Reagan said.
   ``But this past week, it happened,'' he added. ``Seeds of freedom
and greater trust were sown, and I just have to believe that, in
ways we may not even be able to guess, those seeds will take root
and grow.''
   Reagan also discussed the forthcoming economic summit of the
leaders of seven industrial nations, which he will attend June 19-21
in Toronto, and said, ``It is my belief that liberty should be as
important a concern in Toronto as it was in Moscow.''
   ``Liberty in the economic sphere means low taxes, it means paring
away needless regulations and reducing counterproductive government
planning and interference, and it means keeping down barriers to
international trade here and around the world,'' he said.
   Reagan said the leaders at the economic summit will ``celebrate
the success of free markets.''

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address, delivered Saturday from the Oval Office:
   My fellow Americans, it was just yesterday that I returned from
my historic Moscow summit meeting with General Secretary (Mikhail
S.) Gorbachev. And it so happens that later this month, I'll be
visiting Canada for an economic summit with the leaders of the
world's industrialized nations.
   I thought I'd take a few moments to tell you about both. First,
my meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev in Moscow. The event
that held perhaps the most immediate historic importance took place
on Wednesday. It was then that General Secretary Gorbachev and I
exchanged the instruments of ratification, bringing into effect the
(Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) INF treaty. The effect of this
treaty will be very simply, to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and
Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The significance of the
INF treaty can hardly be overstated.
   For the first time ever, the levels of nuclear arms will actually
be reduced rather than having caps placed on their growth. These
missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the map or
placed in storage, they will have been destroyed. The exchange of
these instruments of ratification alone would have made the Moscow
summit a success, but the general secretary and I made important
progress in other areas as well. We moved ahead on (Strategic Arms
Reducation Treaty) START negotiations, negotiations that would lead
to a dramatic reduction in both sides' arsenals of strategic nuclear
arms.
   On bilateral issues, I'm especially pleased by our agreement to
hold increased exchanges involving high school students. The number
of students will at first be in the hundreds, but could grow into
the thousands. Imagine it, hundreds and then thousands of young
people who have firsthand knowledge of each other's country, and
yes, who have made friends.
   Turning to regional conflicts, Mr. Gorbachev and I discussed ways
to reduce tension in areas around the globe: Southeast Asia, Africa,
Central America, the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. The
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, of course, represents
an historic step in itself _ one that the general secretary and I
agreed could serve as a model for settling other regional conflicts.
   A key part of my agenda for this Moscow summit as for my previous
meetings with the general secretary, involved human rights.
   Recently, the Soviets have begun to show somewhat more respect
for human rights. In the past year, for example, they have released
some 300 political detainees from detention. It's my hope that what
took place in my Moscow visit will lead to still greater individual
freedom for the peoples of the Soviet Union.
   You see, in addition to my meetings with Mr. Gorbachev, I held
other meetings with monks at a monastery in Moscow, with nearly 100
dissidents and refuseniks _ men and women who have worked for years
for the freedom to speak, to worship, to assemble and to travel _
and at Moscow University with students, indeed with the very
students likely to become the Soviet Union's next generation of
leaders. To the dissidents and refuseniks, I was able to say, ``The
people of the United States and elsewhere support you.'' To the
students, I suggested, ``There is another way to live and govern
your country _ a way of democracy and economic growth; a way in
which creative human energies are released.''
   If anyone had suggested, even as recently as 10 years ago, that
an American president would one day be able to meet with Soviet
dissidents inside Moscow itself or be able to speak to Soviet
students in their own university about human freedom, well I think
you'll agree that a prediction like that would have been dismissed.
   But this past week it happened. Seeds of freedom and greater
trust were sewn, and I just have to believe that in ways we may not
even be able to guess, those seeds will take root and grow.
   Accompanying these new political freedoms are a series of
economic reforms that may begin to inject elements of free
enterprise into the Soviet economy. In two weeks, I'll be attending
my final economic summit in Toronto, where the Western countries
will celebrate the success of free markets. It's my belief that
liberty should be as important a concern in Toronto as it was in
Moscow.
   Liberty in the economic sphere means low taxes, it means paring
away needless regulations and reducing counterproductive government
planning and interference, and it means keeping down barriers to
international trade here and around the world.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   Here is a chronology of the dramatic
rescue of the six miners at the Stolzenbach mine as provided by
Heinz Cramer, a member of the board of mine owner Preussen Elektra:
   _Late Friday, rescuers drill a ventilation hole over the eastern
section of the mine to pump fresh air into the shaft.
   _At about 9.10 p.m. Friday, rescuers detect tapping sounds
through the hole. They first try to verify the sounds with a
stethoscope.
   _Shortly after midnight, a directional microphone provided by a
television crew is lowered into the hole. Rescuers hear the
following faint words: ``They have drilled a hole.''
   _At 2.30 a.m., rescuers hear distinct, regular tapping sounds.
   _At 4 a.m., the first rescue team descends into the shaft to look
for the survivors, carrying medicine and bandages. A second crew
follows shortly afterward.
   _At 4.21 a.m., rescuers detect human figures in the dark,
approach the area and find the six survivors. The survivors are
given oxygen breathing devices and are able to walk on their own
about 1.5 miles to a main ventilation shaft used by rescuers to
enter the mine.
   _At 5.25 a.m., rescuers and survivors reach the ventilation
shaft. A special rescue cage is lowered into the shaft.
   _At 5.30 a.m., Heinz Roese is the first survivor to be pulled to
the surface. The other five are pulled up within 45 minutes.

   Ohio State University wants Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov _ both for its faculty and for an honorary
degree, but his wife says she doubts that he can come.
   ``He has received many, many invitations from other universities,
but he never has received permission from his government to go,''
Yelena Bonner said in a telephone interview Saturday with The
Columbus Dispatch. ``I don't know when he will have the
possibility.''
   Mrs. Bonner, contacted about 2 a.m. Moscow time, said that her
husband was asleep and could not come to the telephone.
   Sakharov, 67, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his continuing
fight for human rights in the Soviet Union. He was not allowed to
leave the country to accept the honor.
   During a 90-minute news conference Friday in Moscow, Sakharov
endorsed some of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's political
policies.
   ``On the whole, I believe perestroika is a serious undertaking
and its international and domestic implications are very serious,
too.''
   Perestroika is Gorbachev's plan for social and economic
restructuring in the Soviet Union.
   The OSU Board of Trustees Friday approved giving an honorary
doctorate in science to Sakharov.
   OSU President Edward H. Jennings wrote letters of invitation to
Sakharov in English and Russian. Rolf F. Barth, a professor of
pathology, was to hand-deliver the letters.
   Jennings said he also wants Sakharov, who helped develop the
Soviet hydrogen bomb, to join the faculty here.
   ``Although we admire his work in human rights, the degree is
definitely for his pioneering work as a physicist,'' said George
Smith, a professor who is chairman of the committee on honorary
degrees.

   The Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth _ regarded as
the pioneer of Birmingham civil rights activism _ accepted the honor
of the renaming of a street forily and friends who suffered through
the movement with him as he survived three bombings and more
beatings than he likes to remember.
   ``They shared the burden,'' Shuttlesworth said. ``If the good
people are silent, then the evil people triumph.''
   A group of city dignitaries officially named Huntsville Road, the
route of many civil rights confrontations, the ``F.L. Shuttlesworth
Drive.''
   Shuttleworth has been the focus of much of last week's Reunion of
the Civil Rights Activists of 1963. The three-day, 25th-anniversary
event ended Friday with a mass rally at Sardis Baptist Church with
Shuttlesworth as the featured speaker.
   Shuttlesworth is credited with laying a foundation for the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s intervention in the city's problems in 1963.
   Councilman Roosevelt Bell called the reunion a ``stockholders
meeting'' of all the people who benefited from the civil rights
movement.
   He called the renaming of the road a ``dividend.''

   The ``Shrinkettes,'' a cheerleading
squad of Wal-Mart Stores employees from New Iberia, La., stole the
show from company founder Sam Walton in their debut at the annual
stockholders meeting.
   The seven-member squad, clad in blue and orange uniforms with big
letters across the front that together spelled out ``Wal-Mart,''
took the stage Friday at Walton's request.
   The squad was formed in February to fight the battle of
shrinkage, which they defined in a cheer as ``anything not accounted
for.''
   Walton asked for a microphone so the crowd could hear them. No
need. ``We talk loud,'' said squad leader Xavier Lewis, to which
Walton conceded and said, borrowing the Cajun phrase, ``Laissez les
bons temps roulez'' _ let the good times roll.
   The Shrinkettes, merciless on shrinkage during their routine,
cheered ``Crush it, crush it!''

   Country music singer Barbara Mandrell
used ringers to win a come-from-behind victory over a team led by
Bob Hope in the Barbara Mandrell Celebrity Softball Classic.
   A bevy of celebrities including talk show host Oprah Winfrey,
entertainer Dick Clark, rock musician Meat Loaf and rap musician
L.L. Cool J turned out for the 18-17 victory Friday by Mandrell's
AT&T Ringers over Hope's Pepsi Challengers.
   Before the game, Hope was anything but pessimistic.
   ``Pay no attention to Barbara's team,'' the comedian said.
``We're gonna kill 'em. We're gonna win, even if we have to cheat.''
   Mandrell literally got a lift from former Pittsburgh Steelers
great Lynn Swann during one of her trips to the plate. Swann hoisted
the petite singer parallel to the ground, and began swinging his new
``bat.''
   In the second inning, John Stamos, the heartthrob of the ``Full
House'' television show, strutted to the plate and made two strikes
before grounding to Ron Perlman, star of the ``Beauty and the
Beast'' TV show. Stamos joked he ``was a lover not an athlete.''
   ``I'll be the judge of that,'' said pop star Sheena Easton.
   Proceeds from the game went to the Vanderbilt University Medical
Center transplant program.

   Western performers smashed violins and pranced in
black leotards Saturday on the stage of Beijing's Great Hall of the
People, where Mao Tse-tung once warned of Western decadence.
   The gala performance in the hall, used for sessions of China's
Communist Party and parliament, capped a long weekend of luxurious
pleasures for about 200 tourists from 21 countries.
   Their tour _ called ``the return of Marco Polo'' after the
travels to China of the 13th century explorer from Venice _ was
designed to raise funds for the restoration of the Italian lagoon
city and of China's Great Wall.
   The foreign guests were joined by about 7,000 Chinese for the
gala evening.
   The performers included French popular singer Mireille Mathieu,
Russian-born ballerina Maia Plissetskaia, Spanish soprano Monserrat
Caballe and Paris Opera Ballet dancers Sylvie Guillem and Manuel
Legris.
   Guillem and Legris danced to music by the 19th century French
composer Daniel Auber and then returned later in black leotards to
present a sensual modern piece.
   Chinese artists performing included tenor Liu Weiwei and the
choir and orchestra of the Central Opera Theater.
   The evening was broken up by the performance of French artist
Arman. He appeared dressed in a white workman's suit, smashed
several cellos and violins and created a large collage out of the
pieces while a Chinese string quartet played Beethoven's ``Great
Fugue.''
   The show was opened by Ying Ruocheng, vice-minister of culture
and the actor who played the prison warden in the Academy
Award-winning film ``The Last Emperor.''
   Members of the tour each paid $4,300 for the four-day excursion,
including a masked ball, chauffeur-driven black Chinese-built
limousines and boating at the Summer Palace _ the sumptuous retreat
built in the late 19th century by the Empress Dowager Cixi.
   The group earlier Saturday rented out a section of the Great Wall
northeast of Beijing for a champagne lunch.
   The organizer of the tour, Daniel Vial, said the fee for renting
the Great Wall was $54,000, but he did not know the total cost of
the Great Hall extravaganza.
   China, which once shunned all contacts with the West and as
recently as last year staged a major political campaign against
Western ideas, is now avidly promoting tourism as a way to earn
badly-needed foreign currency.
   On Sunday, some members of the tour will attend an auction of
donated Western and Chinese art staged by London-based Sotheby's,
with proceeds also going to Venice and the Great Wall.
   Organizers now say, however, that the Chinese have charged such
high prices for transportation, food, site rentals and service that
the project will barely break even.

   Here is the text of the weekly Democratic radio
address, delivered Saturday by Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va.:
   Good afternoon. This is Sen. Robert Byrd, speaking to you from
Charleston, W.Va. At the invitation of President Reagan, I attended
the summit meeting in Moscow this week along with Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole (of Kansas).
   Our presence at the summit served to demonstrate our unique
system of shared powers. Presidents negotiate treaties; the Senate
gives its advice and consent. Only then does a treaty become the law
of the land.
   Summit meetings are valuable in forging a better understanding
between the American and Soviet peoples. President Reagan received
unprecedented exposure. The Soviet people were impressed by his
personality and willingness to listen.
   Now there is talk of further progress on arms control at the
strategic arms reduction, or START, level. Compared to a START
treaty, however, the (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces) INF treaty
was a simple matter.
   Senate consideration of the INF treaty consumed four months. It
was time well spent. The INF treaty is now a better treaty because
of questions raised by the Senate. There's no substitute for the
painstaking work by our negotiating experts in Geneva. When the
Senate raised important questions on the INF treaty, our experts
returned to the negotiating table to do the work they had left
undone.
   With arms control agreements, the devil is always in the details.
That's why it would be unwise to rush negotiations on START.
Headline-grabbing summits are one thing. But rushing to meet a
deadline on a treaty as important as start would be irresponsible.
The INF treaty covers about 2 percent of all nuclear weapons; the
START agreement would cover 50 percent of all strategic weapons.
   Now may be a good time to reduce the fanfare of the summit and
let the negotiators do their important work in quiet. Further, with
a change of presidents on the horizon, I do not believe it would be
wise to lock the next president into a hasty agreement, be he a
Republican or a Democrat.
   Another priority for America and her allies is to work hard for a
reduction in conventional weapons in Europe and a complete ban on
all chemical weapons. The Soviets enjoy a huge advantage in
conventional forces in Europe, an advantage that we can't allow them
to have forever. Now is the time to push hard at the conventional
arms control table.
   U.S.-Soviet relations are entering a new era. And there are
opportunities in addition to arms control for our two nations to
work together to solve critical problems.
   I suggested to President Reagan in Moscow that he propose a new
program of cooperation with the Soviet Union in the war on drugs. I
did so after hearing Mr. (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev's proposal for a
joint effort to send astronauts to Mars. Why fly men to Mars when
millions of American and Soviet citizens need help right here on
Earth?
   The Soviet Union has a serious problem with alcoholism and here
at home we are under siege by the drug lords. We must attack the
plague of drug abuse on two fronts. We have to educate our people to
the dangers of drug abuse to discourage the demand side of the drug
problem here at home.
   We have to fight the supply side of the drug war on every
international front. The Soviet Union's worldwide operations and
influence could be of help to us and to them as we grapple with the
drug tide crashing in our shores. And we can help the Soviet Union
with their alcohol abuse problem and their own growing drug problem.
Both sides have experience, knowledge and resources that we ought to
marshal. If we can make progress on eliminating arms together, why
can't we make progress on eliminating drug abuse and the plague of
alcoholism?
   The apostle Paul said, ``Where the spirit of the Lord is, there
is liberty.'' I close by saying that glasnost may be growing in the
Soviet Union. Mr. Gorbachev has authorized the distribution of
100,000 Bibles in his country. One hundred thousand Bibles won't go
far in a country that has 280 million people.
   I wrote to Mr. Gorbachev to commend him on this step. I urged him
to expand that number and to see that translations for the many
languages in his country are available to the Soviet people
throughout the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
   Mr. Gorbachev has shown courage in moving his country into the
sunlight. But glasnost will not be real until human rights,
including freedom of religion, are granted to every Soviet citizen.
If glasnost is ever opened to a renewal of freedom of worship, then,
in Paul's words, there will be liberty in the Soviet Union.
   God bless you and thank you for listening.

<TEXT>
   A plot to lure Colombian drug lord
Carlos Lehder Rivas into the arms of U.S. agents by using his
friendship with a convicted smuggler was in the works when Lehder
was caught by police in 1987 following a shootout at a jungle
mansion.
   Lehder, 38, was convicted in May, following a seven-month trial,
of all 11 counts of a 1981 indictment that alleged he conspired to
smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States via the
Bahamas from 1978 to 1980.
   Lehder, a leader of the Medellin cartel of Colombian drug
smugglers, faces life plus 150 years in prison when he is sentenced
July 20 by U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton. The cartel has been
blamed for smuggling 80 percent of the cocaine brought into this
country.
   George Jung, 45, the first witness in Lehder's trial, said he was
contacted by an FBI agent in 1986 with a proposal that he travel to
South America to help lure Lehder into a position where he could be
captured by U.S. agents, such as on a ship in international waters.
   ``The plan was finalized. It was to the point that I was going to
go down there,'' Jung, of Weymouth, Mass., said in a jailhouse
interview with The Associated Press.
   Federal officials asked that Jung's location not be revealed.
   An FBI official in Washington confirmed Jung's story on the
condition that his identity not be revealed.
   He said the plan never got past the discussion stage because of
Lehder's arrest in Colombia in February 1987 and because of the
incredible amount of paperwork and approvals required for such an
operation.
   Jung met Lehder when both were inmates in federal prison in
Danbury, Conn., in 1974 and said he considered the young, brash
Colombian as ``a brother.''
   ``He was very intelligent, articulate, well-mannered. He had an
elegance about him. He was a cut above the rest,'' said Jung.
   They formed a cocaine business using Lehder's drug connections
and Jung's contacts in this country.
   Their first trips involved young women who brought back cocaine
hidden in the lining of suitcases. Jung then began making one or two
flights a week to California, carrying 15 to 25 kilograms, and
dealing with connections he had made in the marijuana business.
   ``We introduced the drug on a large scale in L.A.,'' Jung said.
   That relationship eventually soured when Lehder went behind his
back and cut Jung out of the business.
   In February 1986, while Lehder was still a fugitive hiding in the
jungles of South America, Jung said he was contacted by federal
agents while he was being held in Miami awaiting trial on charges he
smuggled some 660 pounds of cocaine into the United States.
   ``They were working on a plan for me to go down to Colombia and
befriend Carlos again,'' he said. ``It set me back for a few
minutes.''
   In June 1986, Jung pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to
import cocaine and was sentenced to 15 years.
   That fall, discussions began again, including a possible mock
prison escape as a cover story, ``a reason for me to be back in
Colombia.''
   Before the plan could be put in motion, Jung heard a television
report of Lehder's arrest near Medellin, Colombia. Lehder was
immediately placed on a plane and flown to the United States.
   Jung said he was promised nothing in exchange for his testimony
against Lehder, although prosecutors promised to make his
cooperation known to his sentencing judge, who was considering a
motion for reduction of sentence.
   So far, Jung has not heard anything about his sentence being
reduced.
   Jung was the first of 115 witnesses to take the stand against
Lehder.
   ``We definitely looked at each other. ... It was like it had come
to an end and it was time to clear the books,'' said Jung. ``I had
no second thoughts, no qualms.''
   While in prison, Jung has written a book on his life of crime
called: ``Grazing In The Grass Until The Snow Came.''

<HEAD>Radical Students Attempt Suicide, Arrested At US Army Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student tried to burn himself to
death in an anti-government, anti-U.S. protest Saturday, and four
students demanding permission to go to the northern border were
arrested at a U.S. Army base.
   Park Rae-chun, 24, doused his body with flammable liquid and
ignited it at Soongshil University in Seoul.
   ``Overthrow military fascists!'' he shouted before setting
himself afire. Hospital officials said Park was in critical
condition.
   Student sources said Park left a suicide note that strongly
criticized the government and the United States, which has 42,000
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Ritual suicide is a tactic used by South Korea dissidents to
shame the government. In May, two students killed themselves in
anti-government protests.
   Police arrested four student leaders at the headquarters of the
U.S. Army in Seoul on Saturday. The four tried to force their way
through the main gate to get U.S. permission for a planned march to
the border.
   At a meeting Saturday at Seoul's Yonsei University, radical
student leaders elected representatives to meet with North Korean
students June 10 at the truce village of Panmunjom, which is in the
demilitarized zone and under U.S. military control.
   Four students then went to the U.S. base to demand permission to
go to the border. But police seized the students when they arrived
at the base.
   A U.S. officer briefly met with one student before police took
them away in a bus as the students yelled `Yankee go home!'' and
other anti-U.S. slogans.
   A U.S. Army spokesman later said only the South Korean government
can grant permission for civilians to visit the border.
   Police said Saturday that any students marching to the border
would be arrested.
   Radicals said Saturday that they called the June 10 march to
Panmunjom to reunify the divided Korean peninsula and North Korea's
participation in the Olympic Games in Seoul. North Korea is
boycotting the Games after the South rejected its demand to be made
a co-host.
   North Korea's official news agency reported Saturday that its
government will not allow the International Olympic Committee
president to visit the capital of Pyongyang to encourage North
Korean participation in the Games.
   Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch had said he would
accept an invitation to visit North Korea but had ruled out
discussing a demand to be a co-host of the Games.
   The student arrests followed a government warning to crack down
on unrest and what authorities called radicals aiding North Korea.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jai warned Saturday in a nationally
televised speech that the government would not tolerate violent
protests.
   Unification of the two Koreas is an emotional issue for most
Koreans. Most people in the South are distrustful of the North,
which invaded the South in 1950.
   Radical students have attacked U.S. diplomatic posts in recent
protests demanding the U.S. troop withdrawal. The students claim the
United States enforced the 1945 partition of Korea.

<TEXT>
   Yearly summit meetings between U.S. and Japanese
leaders would strengthen ties and help establish global stability
and economic progress, says a report by researchers and politicians
from both countries.
   The study, released Friday by The Japanese-American Study
Committee on Comprehensive Security, also calls for the creation of
a permanent, non-governmental council to advise leaders on issues
that affect both nations.
   Co-chairmen of the committee were former U.S. Undersecretary of
State Philip C. Habib and former Japanese ambassador to the United
States Yoshio Okawara. It is sponsored by the Honolulu-based
organization Pacific Forum and the Asia Pacific Association of Japan.
   ``The United States and Japan collectively represent the most
significant force for global stability and economic progress,'' the
report says. ``Together, the two countries can make unparalleled
contributions to global peace, stability and economic development.''
   The report, titled ``Creative Engagement: Stategies for United
States-Japan Global Cooperation Toward the 21st Century,'' calls for
greater cooperation between the two countries on common strategic
and economic objectives.
   ``In order to live and work together successfully, the United
States and Japan must develop a shared vision of their future and a
set of institutional arrangements that broaden and deepen the
complex bilateral interdependence that already binds them,'' the
report says.
   The committee said summit meetings held each year between the
U.S. president and Japanese prime minister would help focus
attention on a mutually beneficial relationship and establish
deadlines for policies that spur cooperation between the countries.
   ``It will be especially important to hold a summit early in the
new U.S. administration and preparations should begin in both Tokyo
and Washington immediately after the November U.S. election,'' the
report said.
   The committee said the relationship also would be helped by the
creation of an America-Japan Council to examine issues and advise
government leaders.
   The council would be publicly and privately funded, and its
members would represent private and public sectors affected by
issues of mutual interest between the United States and Japan, the
report said.
   The report also called on Japan to increase its military capacity
to perform missions within the framework of a U.S.-Japanese alliance.
   The Pacific Forum is an independent institution with a goal of
fostering regional security and prosperity among the nations of the
Asia-Pacific region. Habib is chairman of the Pacific Forum's board
of directors.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of demonstrators shouting
anti-government slogans marched Saturday to protest President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad's proposal to make Islam the state religion.
   About 3,000 teachers, doctors, engineers, journalists and women's
groups joined the march in the capital after a rally outside Dhaka
University.
   They carried banners reading, ``We do not accept state
interference in individual's rights,'' ``Ershad must go'' and ``No
politics with religion.''
   Ershad's government on May 11 proposed a constitutional amendment
that would make Islam the state religion. More than 85 percent of
Bangladesh's 105 million people are Moslem.
   The proposed amendment also says other religions may be practiced
``in peace and harmony'' in the country.
   But the bill, currently being debated in Parliament, has drawn
sharp criticism. Opposition politicians and women's groups contend
it would undercut fundamental freedoms.
   Ershad's Jatiya Party holds 213 out of 300 seats in the
Parliament and could force the legislation through, but several
senior government officials have suggested that a public referendum
may be called on the issue.
   Christian leaders in Bangladesh expressed concern over the
proposal and urged the government to withdraw the bill.
   ``Whenever religion becomes a concern of the state, it passes
into the hands of political powers,'' the religious leaders said in
a statement published Saturday in the English-language New Nation
newspaper.
   Among the signers was the Rev. Michael Rozario, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Dhaka. Others represented the Baptists, the
National Christian Fellowship and other Protestant denominations.
   There are an estimated 250,000 Christians in Bangladesh. The
other minority groups are Hindus and Buddhists.
   Ershad has been the target of an opposition campaign to oust him
since last November.
   The country's largest opposition coalition, led by Sheik Hasina
of the Awami League, said it would launch a five-day national
protest against the proposed amendment starting Sunday.
   Some political analysts in Dhaka have said they believe Ershad
launched the campaign on Islam to win the support of Moslem
fundamentalists.
   Several conservative Moslem groups have campaigned to make
Bangladesh an Islamic republic and to change its legal system to one
that follows the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
   Bangladesh has been a secular state since it was created after a
war of independence from Pakistan in 1971.

   Rescuers found the bodies of
four miners Saturday, bringing the death toll from a rock-burst in
the world's deepest gold mine to seven.
   The bursting of the rock, which is caused by underground
earthquakes or tremendous pressures at great depths, occurred Friday
night 6,600 feet beneath the surface at Western Deep Levels Gold
Mine.
   Three bodies were recovered immediately, and rescue operations
continued until the rest were found Saturday evening.
   A spokesman for the mine owner, Anglo American Corp., said the
victims' next of kin had not yet been notified.
   The rock-burst occurred in the western shaft, one of two shafts
at Western Deep Levels that extend more than 13,000 feet underground.
   The mine 43 miles west of Johannesburg is unique in that it
operates at such deep levels and is in a geologically unstable area,
said Anglo spokesman James Duncan.
   The mining company has pioneered methods of predicting and
minimizing the danger from rock-bursts, ``but they are a fact of
life there,'' said Duncan.

   Who else do you know who has collected 1,827 brands from 82
countries since 1965?
   Shuler will be named in next year's Guinness Book of World
Records as having the world's largest brew collection, according to
a certificate from Guinness editors Donald MacFarlan and Norris
McWhirter of London.
   ``About a third of them are domestics. I have about 300 or so
from Germany, about 200 from Great Britain and about that many from
Canada,'' Shuler said.
   He even has a special room for the beverages. The bottles are in
10 lighted display cases, and the floor had to be reinforced with
steel beams to support the weight of the collection.
   Shuler said he prefers German beers.
   ``If you get into my favorites, that would be St. Pauli Girl,
Heineken and Thomas Hardy's Ale from Britain ... But it's like your

There are really no two exactly alike.''
   But what does he choose to drink routinely?
   ``Miller Lite. I weigh about 256 pounds,'' he said.

   A mundane remodeling job on a house
became a landlord's dream for Leonard Gooding when he removed some
siding and discovered his old house was actually a cabin made of
hand-hewn logs.
   ``It's in perfect shape. I don't know what's going to happen
now,'' Gooding said in a telephone interview Friday.
   The building of white oak logs is 30 feet wide and 50 feet long.
It has hardwood floors, six windows _ three each on the longest
walls _ and a door on either end. There's no fireplace or plumbing,
but it is wired for electricity.
   Gooding bought the building from a nephew who owned it for 10
years.
   Before that it was used as a church by the Assemblies of God for
dozens of years, and its shape leads Gooding to think that's what it
was originally built for.
   ``Some of my older neighbors remember seeing the log house as
kids. We just don't know how old it really is,'' said Gooding,
adding that he knows it goes back at least until 1939.
   Gooding is considering uses for the building.
   ``I'm already getting some interest and some offers on it,'' he
said. ``I think it would make a nice antique store, or lake home or
even a restaurant. I may sell it to someone who wants to move it.
   ``It's sure something that changes your mind. It completely
turned me around.''

   It doesn't take much to earn a degree
from the Wilburton College of Loafing. In fact, the less done, the
better.
   ``All they've got to do is verify _ and we usually take their
word for it _ that they're a loafer of some type,'' says Stoney
Hardcastle, the college's founder.
   ``Loafing is really a practiced skill down here in southeastern
Oklahoma,'' Hardcastle said from his home Friday night. He said he
was lying on the couch when the phone rang.
   ``We usually start very young _ lying in the shade, watching the
birds, daydreaming.''
   And what would be an example of doing a little too much?
   ``If you paddle a boat. You should have a motor on it,'' he said.
   Hardcastle, a retired journalism teacher who volunteers his
services for the Wilburton Chamber of Commerce, started the loafing
college last year as a way to raise money for a local Christmas
Fund. More than 2,000 people enrolled from around the world, paying
$2 for their bachelor's degrees.

   Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, the Charles
Manson follower serving a life term for trying to kill
then-President Gerald Ford, has been transferred from a prison where
she escaped last year to one in Kentucky with better security,
officials said.
   Fromme, 39, was moved Friday to the Lexington Federal
Correctional Institution, said Ron Burkhart, warden of the Alderson
Federal Correctional Institution in West Virginia.
   She was sentenced May 25 to an additional 15 months in prison for
escaping from the all-female Alderson prison for two days last
December.
   The Lexington prison is ``basically a level 1 (minimum) security
installation, but within that institution we operate a high-security
unit,'' Burkhart said Saturday. ``She'll be housed in the
high-security unit.''
   Alderson, a medium-security prison in the mountains of southern
West Virginia, has no separate unit to house dangerous inmates or
those considered escape risks.
   Fromme was the first person sentenced under a special federal law
covering assaults on presidents, a statute enacted after the 1963
assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   She was arrested after she aimed a semiautomatic pistol at Ford
on Sept. 5, 1975, in Sacramento, Calif. A Secret Service agent
grabbed her, and Ford was unhurt.
   During her sentencing on the escape charge, Fromme told U.S.
District Court Judge Elizabeth V. Hallanan that she couldn't promise
that she would not try to escape again.
   Fromme had said she left the prison Dec. 23 in order to be closer
to Manson. She was recaptured near the prison on Christmas Day.
   Manson is serving a life term in San Quentin in California for
the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and eight others. Fromme,
one of his ``family'' of followers, was not implicated in those
attacks.
   Fromme had been eligible for parole since 1985 but had elected
not to go before a parole board. Her conviction on escape charges
means she will not be eligible for parole again for at least one
year, officials said.
   Seventeen days after Fromme's attempt on Ford's life, Sara Jane
Moore, a 45-year-old political activist, was arrested in San
Francisco after she fired a gun at the president. Again, Ford was
unhurt.
   Moore also escaped from the Alderson prison, in 1979. She was
recaptured less than a day later and is now at a federal prison in
California.

   Afghan President Najib made a surprise call
Saturday on Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to review the
superpower summit and settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan,
Tass said.
   The news agency said Najib stopped off in Moscow en route to New
York, where he will attend the Third Special Disarmament Session of
the United Nations General Assembly.
   The brief Tass dispatch said Najib ``spoke highly'' of
Gorbachev's summit meeting last week with President Reagan. It said
Gorbachev and Najib touched on the Afghanistan government's attempts
to end the bloody civil war and on relations between Kabul and
Moscow.
   The meeting was not announced in advance.
   The Soviet Union began pulling its more than 100,000 troops out
of Afghanistan on May 15 under an agreement signed in April in
Geneva. The troops arrived in December 1979 to help the Kabul
government fight anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   The Soviet Union has warned it might halt or slow the pullout
unless Pakistan stops aiding the guerrillas. Many of the guerrillas'
weapons come from the United States.
   Also at Saturday's meeting with Najib was Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Central Committee foreign affairs
secretary Anatoly Dobrynin, Tass said.

<TEXT>
   In the frantic minutes after an
explosion rocked the Borken mine, veteran miner Thomas Gepperth led
his tiny group from the deadly carbon monoxide to survival in what
West Germans have dubbed ``The Miracle of Borken.''
   Before Gepperth and his five colleagues were found, officials
repeatedly had said none of the 57 men trapped could have survived.
Thirty-seven were confirmed dead and 14 were missing.
   The six men, their faces blackened, were pulled to the surface on
stretchers over a 45-minute period beginning at 5:30 a.m. Saturday.
The group had spent 65 hours about 500 feet underground after the
explosion that blasted the Stolzenbach mine with earthquake-like
force.
   The tall, blond Gepperth, 36, stood calmly with the others _ four
West Germans and one Turk _ as they posed for photographers after
washing up. The five were identified as Helmut Gesner, Heinz Roese,
Egon Dehn and Wilfried Doench and Ahmet Batkan.
   ``Everybody was making their last wills and testaments,''
Gepperth said as he appeared after the dramatic rescue. ``I told
them they didn't have to.'' His brief remarks were made in an
interview with state television.
   ``I never gave up. I always said, `They'll make it and get us out
of here,''' Gepperth said.
   Another survivor, also interviewed on state television but not
identified by name, said the survivors heard drilling on Friday, but
then the noises temporarily stopped.
   ``That was really agonizing, because nothing more was going on up
there. ``You start thinking, `Have they forgotten us or something?
Maybe they're figuring it's not worth it.'''
   The man said that in the hours of waiting, he began to ``see
lights that aren't really there.''
   Heinz Cramer, a board member of the company that owns the mine,
gave an account of the survival.
   He said the group tried to flee toward the exit after the
explosion.
   ``The mining superviser (Gepperth), who is also a member of the
mine's rescue squad, recognized it was carbon monoxide poisoning,''
he continued.
   Cramer said Gepperth ordered his men to turn away from the
direction of the exit, from where the poison was coming, and walk
toward an air pocket.
   ``So they turned around and found shelter in one of the side
areas,'' Cramer said. ``(Gepperth) told them to remain quiet and
calm so they would preserve the oxygen.''
   ``You can certainly call Gepperth's actions something special. He
reacted in exactly the right way,'' he said.
   A man who identified himself as Egon Dehn's brother-in-law said
the six kept their spirits up by recalling a 1963 mining accident in
the Lower Saxony region in which 11 men were rescued after two weeks.
   The 1963 accident has become known as the ``Miracle of Lengede,''
after the mining town where it occurred _ and West Germans quickly
dubbed the Saturday rescue ``The Miracle of Borken.''
   Cramer said search efforts were being stepped up following
unconfirmed reports that two more survivors may be in a nearby area.
   ``It's a faint hope, but a superviser said there were tracks of
two people who may also be in an area where they may have
survived,'' Cramer said.
   Peter-Carl Ruehland, a spokesman for the mine owner Preussen
Elektra, declined to speculate on how much longer the six men could
have survived in the mine.
   ``To the right and to the left of where they were, the levels of
carbon monoxide were rising,'' Ruehland said.

<HEAD>Superfast Trains Touted as Solutions to Airport, Road Congestion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of a gathering on high-speed train
travel touted a half-dozen versions of superfast trains as potential
solutions to growing airport and road congestion in the United
States. But none of the prototypes was made in America.
   The trains, some now operating and some in the experimental
stage, can reach speeds of 130 to 300 miles an hour. Four had trains
with wheels and two had wheel-less vehicles that use a magnetic
levitation system. That system uses electromagnetic force for
guidance and propulsion, with the train maintaining minimum contact
with a guideway.
   In a speech during the High Speed Rail Association's meeting,
John H. Riley, the U.S. government's rail administrator, predicted
high-speed rail would be a reality ``in our lifetime,'' and said he
could not imagine that the United States would be the only advanced
country ``left behind when the high-speed train leaves the station.''
   A dozen projects using high-speed trains are being considered in
the United States, which was built up by railroads a century ago.
But the U.S. proposals are all in the early stages, delegates the
meeting were told this past week.
   The prototypes, which come from Europe, Japan and Canada, are:
   _West Germany's Intercontinental Express train, which on a May 1
trial run with passengers set a new speed record for wheeled trains
of 252 mph.
   _The French TGV, the world's fastest in regular operation, which
has reached a speed of 236 mph and operates regularly at a maximum
of 168 mph between Paris and Lyon.
   _Canada's LRC (Light-Rapid-Comfortable) diesel locomotive with
tilting-body coaches.
   _Japan's ``Shinkansen,'' known abroad as the Bullet Train, the
world's first superfast train system. It has carried more than 2
billion passengers without a single casualty since it started 24
years ago running at speeds up to 130 mph.
   _Japan's experimental magnetic levitation rail car, which has
reached an unmanned speed of 321 mph.
   _The European Transrapid International magnetic levitation
vehicle, which reached 252 mph with passengers on its test track at
Emsland, West Germany, last Dec. 11, the same speed as the wheeled
Intercontinental Express train this year.
   The proposed U.S. systems under study:
   _Pennsylvania. A 300 mph magnetic levitation system suggested
between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
   _Northeast Corridor. Possible upgrading of the Boston-New
York-Washington route to the French TGV standard.
   _Empire Corridor. The New York-Albany-Montreal (Canada) route.
   _Florida. Miami-Orlando-Tampa. Authorities are considering
proposals by a U.S.-Swedish-Swiss-Japanese consortium and by a
French-U.S. company.
   _Georgia. Atlanta-Macon-Savannah. Possible French participation.
   _Ohio. Cleveland-Columbus-Cincinnati. Task force report due June
30.
   _Chicago-Detroit. Under study by U.S. and European experts.
   _Colorado. Pueblo-Denver-Fort Collins corridor under study.
   _Texas. Dallas-Houston-San Antonio-Austin-Dallas triangle under
study by West German experts.
   _New Mexico. Los Alamos-Santa Fe-Abuquerque-Las Cruces corridor
under study.
   _Los Angeles. Routes to Las Vegas and San Francisco under study.
Los Angeles-San Diego project abandoned for financial and
environmental reasons.
   _Pacific Northwest. Portland-Seattle-Vancouver (Canada) under
study.

   Exactly what an unidentified deaf-mute boy
has gone through remains a mystery, in spite of his repeated
drawings showing a crashed plane with bodies that may be his
parents, an FBI agent said Saturday.
   ``We have no clues at all,'' said agent Terry Kincaid.
   Of the boy's drawings, he said, ``We have no idea how much of his
sketches are his own idea or his imagination or maybe re-creations
of popular television shows.''
   The boy has been in a child protective service center since
November in Juarez, Mexico, where he was found on the streets, but
investigators suspect he might be from the United States because of
his preferences in food and games.
   The boy is believed to be 7 or 8 years old and is called Sabat by
welfare workers because he was found on a Saturday.
   Investigators have discovered that the boy has been in the United
States at least once, Kincaid said Saturday.
   Before taking him to the center, Guadalupe de la Vega, the Juarez
woman who found him wandering about, took him to see an ear
specialist in New York and then brought him back to Mexico, Kincaid
said.
   The woman's first encounter with the boy was surprising.
   ``He was on the streets in Juarez and this woman thought he was
begging. She gave him a thousand pesos and he handed it back to
her,'' Kincaid said.
   ``From the way he keeps drawing the same pictures, and has his
clothes packed, I think he is desperate to find his way back home,''
said Leticia Cota, a social worker in Juarez.
   ``We are continuing efforts to develop leads as to this little
guy's identity through whatever means possible. It's going to be an
uphill struggle,'' said Kincaid.
   Kincaid said that during the trip to New York, the boy became
excited when he saw a soldier. ``We're exploring the possibility
that his father may have been a policeman or soldier, or someone
associated with a uniform,'' he said.
   Kincaid said Mexican social workers initially thought the boy was
Mexican, until he showed a preference for hamburgers over Mexican
food.
   He draws a house with a pitched roof, not common in Mexico, and
indicates it was his home. He excels at video games with which few
Mexican children are familiar, and is familiar with U.S. currency.
   Mexican social workers contacted their El Paso counterparts last
month, and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in
Washington sought the help of the FBI in El Paso last week to find
the boy's identity.
   At least two leads are being pursued, said Luis Torre, a
caseworker for the Texas Department of Human Services in El Paso.
   ``Law officials think he resembles a boy from Illinois who was
reported missing about three years ago, or a boy from a military
family who lived in Alaska,'' Torre said.
   Kincaid said officials expected to receive by Monday copies of
footprints of a child who was kidnapped from Decatur, Ill., in
October 1985. The description of the kidnapped child was forwarded
from the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
   Kincaid said the boy is in good health. ``He seems to have a good
attitude notwithstanding everything he has apparently gone
through,'' Kincaid said.
   His pictures of a crashed airplane include people that he
describes as his father, mother, younger sister and himself and have
the numbers ``28D, 23'' written under the airplane.
   During an interview Friday, the boy pointed to scars on his left
knee, stomach and back, and back to the crash drawing. He pointed to
a drawing of himself walking away from the crash while the figures
believed to be his parents and sister lay dead.
   The age of the boy's scars led doctors to believe that if they
had been caused by a crash, it would have been two to three years
ago.
   Social workers said that through drawings and other
communication, the boy has revealed background details that indicate
his father was missing four fingers on his right hand and had a
mustache and that the family lived in a place that had knee-deep
snow, heavy rainfall, mountains and trees.
   The boy is 4 feet 6, has dark blond to light brown hair and a
slightly freckled white complexion.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met with King
Hussein Saturday and said the Jordanian monarch is reluctant to
engage in peace talks with Israel unless Israel agrees to give up
land on the West Bank.
   ``If they feel there is no territorial compromise possible, they
then feel, `What am I going to negotiate about?''' Shultz told
reporters during his trip back to Egypt from the Jordanian capital
of Amman.
   Shultz, on a mission to promote a U.S. peace plan for the region,
flies to Israel on Sunday to try to get the assurance Hussein seeks
from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. His prospects are not bright.
   Shamir told Israel radio Saturday he still opposes the U.S.
proposal for an international peace conference and does not expect a
breakthrough during Shultz's visit. He also opposes trading land for
peace, the other essential part of the American plan.
   During his 2{-hour meeting, Shultz said he found an ``intensity
of interest'' by Hussein in the U.S. plan for Arab-Israeli
negotiations. ``As a general proposition, they are in favor of
proceeding,'' Shultz said.
   But Hussein ``hesitates to say `yes, we will go into the talks,'
until they have some assurances that it's going to be based on the
formula of trading territory for peace,'' Shultz said.
   Jordan controlled the West Bank from 1948 until 1967, when it
joined Egypt and Syria in a war with Israel and lost the territory,
including east Jerusalem.
   Shultz supports Jordan's demand for an Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank but has said giving up all the land was ``not in the
cards.''
   Shultz has two sessions scheduled Sunday with Shamir and separate
meetings with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and members of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset.
   This is his fourth trip to the area this year. Shultz said on his
arrival Friday night he knew the odds were against him.
   Shultz began the day with a session with President Hosni Mubarak
of Egypt, who has endorsed the U.S. approach in principle. Shultz
has made Cairo his base, shuttling from the Egyptian capital to meet
with other leaders.
   ``We had a good personal visit,'' Shultz said after he and
Mubarak spent an hour in private. ``It's good to start this trip to
the Middle East here in Egypt. We worked together earlier this year,
trying to get this initiative going.''
   But in a session with Egyptian editors before flying to Amman, he
said ``the situation remains one in which there are great problems.''
   Shultz said President Reagan wants to ``accomplish as much as he
can and to leave as much of a constructive base for his successors
as possible.''
   In the interview, Shultz expressed understanding for Shamir's
security concerns. ``Israel cannot afford to make a bad mistake in
this regard,'' he said.
   But Shultz said he also had told the Israeli prime minister that
``it's possible to be too careful and miss opportunities that may
not appear again.''
   At the same time, Shultz said he doubted ``the workability'' of
an independent Palestinian state. He said Americans understood the
concept of a Palestinian movement but the Palestine Liberation
Organization's sponsorship of terrorist activities made it an
unacceptable negotiating partner for Israel.
   In Algiers, President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria said Shultz's
peace mission was doomed because of the ``obstinate American
refusal'' to recognize Palestinian rights, the official news agency
reported.
   Arab leaders will open a summit meeting in the Algerian capital
Tuesday to discuss support for Palestinian Arabs in their uprising
against Israeli authorities.
   Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, said in
Jiddah it was a ``sacred duty'' for the Arabs to support the
uprising, in which more than 200 Palestinians have died since Dec. 8.

   No. 2 Kremlin leader Yegor K. Ligachev broke his
silence Saturday on reports that he leads a conservative faction and
said enemies are trying to divide a leadership united behind Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``Adversaries in the West, and some people in our country too,
are making allegations about differences among the Soviet
leadership, in the Politburo,'' the 67-year-old Ligachev said.
   ``These allegations have been made more than once, which means
they are being made deliberately. Trying to drive a wedge in the
leadership is a notorious trick,'' he said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass carried Ligachev's remarks, made at a
meeting in Togliatti, a Volga River port 600 miles east of Moscow.
They were his first comments on reports of discord in the leadership.
   In an excerpt of the speech broadcast on the evening television
news program ``Vremya,'' the round-faced, gray-haired Ligachev told
an auditorium of Togliatti officials and residents that the Soviet
Union's enemies are foolish to try to divide the leadership.
   ``If it worked in the past, when they threw out falsehoods about
previous leading figures, and it led to the ruin of people, then in
current conditions, such a trick simply won't go through, for these
are different times, with a different policy and different
leaders,'' Ligachev declared.
   ``All the members of the leadership, with Mikhail Gorbachev at
their head, are deeply committed to the cause of perestroika,'' he
said.
   Ligachev, a full member of the 13-man ruling Politburo in charge
of Communist Party ideology, has indicated in earlier speeches that
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, has gone too far in
criticizing past economic and social policies.
   There have been other signs that he favors a more cautious
approach than Gorbachev to perestroika, the program of restructuring
Soviet society.
   In referring to Soviet adversaries alleging leadership
differences, Ligachev probably had in mind Boris N. Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin, a former Gorbachev protege and ex-Moscow party boss,
told the British Broadcasting Corp. last Monday that Ligachev should
step down ``because processes in the party are too slow, because the
party is still lagging behind, because the process of
democratization is not developing ... and Comrade Ligachev is the
main person responsible.''
   Yeltsin later denied suggesting that Ligachev resign.
   Gorbachev got into the fray Wednesday. He told the first news
conference in Moscow by a Soviet leader that the Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee does not share Yeltsin's views.
   ``As for Comrade Ligachev and his resignation: no such problem
exists either in the Central Committee or in the Politburo, and
that's it,'' he said.
   Such public airing of top-echelon Kremlin disagreement is
unprecedented.
   Rumors spread in Moscow in mid-April that Ligachev and Gorbachev
had a bitter face-off, with Ligachev backing a newspaper article
defending the late dictator Josef V. Stalin and Gorbachev
counterattacking through another article pushing radical reforms.
   The two have made several public appearances together since then,
with no obvious sign of disagreements.
   In his Togliatti speech, Ligachev tried to put himself firmly in
the camp of reform advocates.
   ``There are, certainly, people who do not accept perestroika,
wish to live in an old way,'' Tass paraphrased Ligachev as saying.
``But on the whole, different processes are predominantly under way
in this country.''
   He said ``rightists in the West'' fear perestroika because it
strengthens socialism, and they are trying to encourage development
of a multi-party system in the Soviet Union.
   ``All that is aimed at weakening political stability in the
country, upsetting social justice and stimulating a far-reaching
social stratification of the society,'' Tass paraphrased him as
saying.
   Ligachev said the Communist Party will not be dismantled because
it is ``the guarantee of irreversibility of perestroika.''

<HEAD>DNA Study Shows Possible Alcohol-Cancer Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies into possible links between cancer and
alcohol suggest that only one or two drinks can be enough to have a
carcinogenic effect, according to a University of California
research team.
   UC Berkeley researchers reported Friday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences that they found that when DNA, the
essential component of living matter, is damaged by alcohol it
closely resembles DNA altered by known carcinogens.
   The findings come on the heels of a California scientific
advisory panel's recommendation in April that alcohol be added to a
state list of chemicals known to cause cancer.
   ``This certainly reinforces our decision,'' said Alice Whittemore
of Stanford University, a member of the panel created by Gov. George
Deukmejian under a toxics initiative passed by voters.
   Alcohol will appear on the toxics list July 1, state Health and
Welfare Undersecretary Thomas E. Warriner said. The industry will
then have 12 months to work out how it will provide the warning.
   Such warnings could take the form of notices posted in bars and
restaurants. There also have been proposals that warnings be placed
on individual beverage containers.
   The alcohol industry has resisted such warning labels, arguing
that it has never been demonstrated in animal tests that alcohol can
cause cancer.
   The researchers said they found that DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid,
is chemically changed when combined in test tube experiments with
alcohol and acetaldehyde, the principal product formed from alcohol
in mammalian cells.
   The altered DNA is similar to that produced by other chemicals
known to cause cancer, said molecular biologists Heinz
Fraenkel-Conrat and Bea Singer of Berkeley.
   Those alterations occur at concentrations of alcohol and
acetaldehyde that would be produced by only one or two drinks, said
the researchers, who are husband and wife.
   They added that they didn't know exactly how much drinking might
cause cancer, but Ms. Singer said, ``I am convinced alcohol is a
carcinogen.''
   Michelle Corash, a lawyer representing the alcohol industry,
reiterated the industry's position.
   ``Every other chemical that causes cancer in humans also causes
it in animals, so we don't think alcohol is a carcinogen,'' she said.
   In the past, the only evidence linking alcohol to cancer has come
from epidemiological studies that suggest a higher incidence of
tumors of the breast, liver, rectum and mouth in humans who consume
moderate to large amounts of alcohol.
   Fraenkel-Conrat and Ms. Singer are working with biologist Martha
R. Stampfer of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to determine if
alcohol and acetaldehyde can cause tumors in human breast cells
grown in the laboratory. If tumors are formed there, they say they
will then expand their studies to include animals.

   An Italian journalist jailed for more than six months
in Afghanistan said he had to rely on the charity of other prisoners
to get enough to eat and that he wanted to go back to Afghanistan.
   Fausto Biloslavo, 26, arrived in Rome on Thursday aboard a
special private plane from Kabul. He had entered Afghanistan in July
with anti-Marxist insurgents and was arrested Nov. 14 after he was
captured by two children with machine guns.
   In March, he was convicted of espionage and sentenced to seven
years in prison. His release Thursday came after a plea from Italian
President Francesco Cossiga. He had shared a cell with French
freelance photojournalist Alain Guillo, who was freed last week
after an appeal by French President Francois Mitterrand.
   During a news conference Friday, Biloslavo declined to give many
specifics about his imprisonment. He said he will eventually publish
notes he wrote on the inside of cigarette packages.
   He said he was held at Puli Charki prison in Kabul after his
trial.
   ``I had to relay on the charity of the poor people held there in
order to have enough to eat and clothes to wear,'' he said. Later,
he said an Italian diplomatic official helped him get enough food
and clothing.
   He said that besides the Afghan prisoners at Puli Charki, he saw
40 Pakistanis, 20 Iranians and a young Turk. He said 95 percent of
the foreigners had been ``brutally tortured,'' but he declined to
say how.
   Biloslavo said he was not beaten after his imprisonment, but said
he was whipped by an officer after his capture.
   He denied that someone could have turned him in, but added that
the Afghan resistance movement is extremely fragmented and
``contains a number of rogues'' for whom ``a reporter would be worth
thousands of dollars.''
   After his arrest, he said he was taken to the prison of the
``secret police,'' where he was held for four months in conditions
he described as ``decent.''
   Biloslavo said his trial was a farce and that the accusations
were ``crazy.''
   He said he was never given any hints as to his approaching
liberation, and the only way he had kept in touch with the outside
world were through rumors and the official television.
   He said he would seek a visa to return to Afghanistan.
   Anti-communist guerrillas have been fighting a civil war in
Afghanistan since the late 1970s. Soviet troops entered the country
in 1979, replacing one pro-Soviet regime with another and staying to
protect that regime from the guerrillas.
   The Soviets began withdrawing their estimated 115,000 troops from
Afghanistan in May.

<HEAD>American Students End Soviet Stay On A `Summit' Note</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of American students who spent two months
in the Soviet Union return home this week, buoyed by experiences
that ranged from wading in a Russian swamp to feeling the
electricity of superpower summitry.
   The 16 students, mostly from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire,
took classes in Russian language and literature, as well as
environmental issues, at Moscow State University. The program was
born of the December summit meeting in Washington.
   In return, a like number of Soviet students will study in
Hanover, N.H., this summer.
   The students witnessed the hopeful political changes under
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but they also saw the prejudices toward women,
blacks and Jews, as well as the bleakness of the Soviet economy.
   ``There was graffiti in the elevator at the university,'' said
Celia Jablow a senior from Claremont, Calif. ``It said `Kill a Jew,
save the Soviet Union.' One of our people erased it.''
   ``It is really a hard thing to talk to someone for two hours
continuously about how much they hate blacks and how incompetent
biologically they think they are,'' added Catherine Atwell, a junior
from Washington, D.C.
   She also recounted hearing continually how women should stay in
the home, as well as hearing the phrase, ``You've got a girl's
memory.''
   But the students said that Muscovites seemed to be more
politically aware under Gorbachev, less afraid of foreigners, and
more hopeful about their future _ although the economic changes are
slow to arrive, what with shortages of sugar and toothpaste.
   On May 29, while on a field trip to a swampy nature preserve near
the Oka River, about 70 miles northwest of Moscow, the group
gathered around a TV set in the home of a groundskeeper and joined a
group of Russians to watch President Reagan land in the Soviet Union.
   ``They were really happy to see Reagan _ much happier than we
were,'' said Atwell.
   ``Yeah, we made a few cynical remarks along the way _ you know,
typical American students,'' added Peter MacDonald, a junior from
Andover, Mass. ``When Reagan spoke, everyone would watch us and when
Gorbachev spoke, everyone (of us) would watch them.''
   The Americans, who have all concentrated on Russian studies and
have studied the language an average of three years, were questioned
by the Soviets on Reagan's referring to their country as ``the evil
empire.''
   ``They asked us, ``Did he really say that?''' Atwell said.
   Another of the Dartmouth group, Paul Wlodkowski, of Augusta,
Maine, met briefly with Reagan after his speech to Moscow university
students and acted as a translator for Cable News Network.
   Jablow said their student accomodations weren't bad, but the main
problem was ``a certain feeling of being trapped.'' There were no
telephones in the dormitory rooms, which each housed two students.
   Visitors would drop by often and not ``understand the need to be
alone at times when you need your own space,'' Jablow said.
   There was little time to do sightseeing, she said. ``Most of your
time you weren't in class or doing homework, you felt an obligation
_ at least I did _ to meet people and talk.''
   Although the exchange program was designed to concentrate on
environmental studies, group adviser and Dartmouth professor Barry
Scherr said its real purpose was to give the students greater
exposure to Russian language, literature and society.
   Other Dartmouth Students on the trip were Loretta Berger, of
Lexington, Mass.; Katherine Chernishov of Riverdale, N.Y.; Heidi
Crebo of Marston's Mills, Mass.; Mark Filimonov of Hanover, N.H.;
Joseph Hatem of Methuen, Mass.; Betsy Heafitz of Swampscott, Mass.;
Peter Hujik of Monona, Wis.; Jeffrey Matusow of Durham, N.H.; and
Allison Smith of Bath, Ohio.
   There also were two students from Minnesota's Carleton College,
Brett Duffy and Anders Nelson, and Deborah Budek of Wheaton College
in Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Judge Says Mom's Smoking Around 4-Year-Old Is Child Abuse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Circuit Court judge has ruled that a
woman smoker may not light up in confined areas around her
4-year-old child, but the angry woman says she'll appeal the order.
   ``Exposing a child whose lungs are still growing to passive smoke
is another form of child abuse,'' Judge Bill Swann said Friday after
issuing the order to Priscilla Bullock.
   Ms. Bullock said she was in court to respond to a petition filed
by her ex-husband, Christopher Reeves, to lower his child-support
payment and to modify visitation privileges. His petition was denied
two months ago and he was appealing to Swann.
   The petition was denied again, but Ms. Bullock said that ``from
out of the blue,'' Swann granted a request by her ex-husband's
lawyer to prohibit the mother from smoking around the child in a
confined environment, such as a home or a car.
   ``I am 30 years old. This is a violation of my civil rights,''
she said. ``My (former) husband drinks beer and I didn't say he
couldn't drink around the child. ...
   ``It's time for me to move out of Tennessee if a judge can keep
me from having a cigarette in my own home.''
   Ms. Bullock also must not allow others to smoke in her home if
the child is present.
   Swann, who said he has made similar rulings in the past two
years, said in these cases ``the court takes judicial notice of the
particular dangers passive smoke has on developing lungs.''
   He said providing a healthy environment is as important as
ensuring the child has adequate food, clothing, shelter and
education.
   Ms. Bullock said she would appeal Swann's ruling.

<HEAD>Avianca Airlines Fined, Jet Seized After Cocaine Found In Roses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Avianca Airlines cargo jet was seized Saturday
and the carrier fined nearly $8 million after Customs agents found
490 pounds of cocaine stashed in a shipment of red roses.
   ``This is the 14th time since January 1986'' that drugs were
found aboard an Avianca flight, said Customs spokesman Michael
Sheehan. ``Avianca is a source of great concern for the Customs
Service.''
   Avianca is the national airline of Colombia.
   The cocaine was found on Flight 768 from Bogota, which carried
2,000 boxes of assorted flowers, 30 of them listed as containing red
roses, Sheehan said.
   Eight of the rose boxes were packed with cocaine, he said.
   ``All 2,000 boxes were checked. Each of the eight boxes weighed
about twice as much as a normal box, which should weigh about 30
pounds,'' Sheehan said. No arrests were made.
   The carrier's Boeing 747 was seized at Miami International
Airport to ensure payment of fines levied for Saturday's cache.
Avianca must pay $16,000 for each pound of cocaine or its plane
could be auctioned off, said Sheehan, adding that the airline has
paid its past fines and received its planes back.
   A fine for 490 pounds would total $7.8 million.
   Including Saturday's find, Customs agents have turned up a total
of about 5,000 pounds of cocaine on Avianca flights, often hidden in
such perishable shipments as flowers or food.
   Other recent smuggling discoveries here on Avianca jets include
132 pounds of cocaine hidden in a Valentine's Day shipment of roses,
and a March 27 find of 35.8 pounds.
   Avianca offices in Miami were closed, and its airport agents said
company officials were not available for comment.
   Besides seizing the jet, Sheehan said that Customs agents also
confiscated the 22 real boxes of red roses and sent them to Baptist
Hospital in Miami.
   ``We hope that some of the patients in the hospital are able to
enjoy them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II took a spin in a
sleek red Ferrari sports car to the cheers of a crowd Saturday when
he visited the headquarters of Italy's most renowned racing team.
   Piero Lardi Ferrari, the son of the company's grand old boss,
drove the ``Mondial Cabrio'' along the Fiorano track near Modena,
where the company's Formula One racers are tested.
   The car, capable of reaching speeds in excess of 155 mph,
occasionally sputtered as it moved around the track at 12 to 18 mph
with the pope aboard.
   John Paul, on his second day of a five-day visit to the
Emilia-Romagna region, stood and clenched the windshield as the car
negotiated the twisty course between two lines of several hundred
cheering faithful.
   ``Il papa in pista!'' (the pope on the track), the announcer
shouted into the loudspeakers. The drive was the highlight of the
pontiff's three-hour visit.
   The pope had been expected to meet Enzo Ferrari, the 90-year-old
company chairman and avowed agnostic who in the past has had stormy
relations with the Vatican, which had harshly criticized his racing
activities.
   Piero Lardi Ferrari said the meeting was canceled because his
father developed a fever Thursday night ``and preferred not to leave
home.'' The elder Ferrari suffers from a kidney disease. His son
said Saturday that his father's condition was not serious.
   The pope met privately with Ferrari relatives and talked to the
elder Ferrari by telephone.
   ``They spoke for about five minutes,'' Vatican spokesman Giovanni
D'Ercole said. ``It was a courtesy gesture by the pope toward
Ferrari. They exchanged good wishes, and the pope listened with
great attention. One can imagine that Ferrari was moved.''
   The pope also met with Ferrari Formula One drivers Gerhard Berger
of Austria and Michele Alboreto of Italy and addressed a crowd of
workers from a stand on the edge of the track.
   He shook hands with the two drivers and cast a quick glance at a
Ferrari racer exhibited in the courtyard along with some old models.
   He looked amazed and said ``it's an impressive speed'' when
Berger told him it can reach 186 mph.
   In his speech to a few thousand workers and their families, the
pope denounced serious pollution and threats to the environment
``caused by the anxiety of the maximum profit, which leads to a
senseless exploitation of natural resources.''
   He again emphasized the ``right to work'' for all people and said
that technological innovations ``must be pursued and accepted, but
must be oriented to the service of the man.''
   Before leaving Fiorano, he thanked the audience ``for your
patience and for the gifts, which allow me to make some charity.''
   The gifts included a horse and dozens of wheels of Parmesan
cheese.

   When members of the Oak Grove Double
Churches look to the heavens for guidance, they have a clear view.
   Somebody stole their roof.
   Jessie Gobert Jr., 22, of Oxford, was arrested at his home Friday
and charged with the theft, said Capt. Marvin Melton of the DeSoto
Parish Sheriff's Department.
   Church members discovered the tin roof was gone a week ago.
Melton said Gobert and two as-yet-unidentified accomplices are
suspected of selling it for scrap metal.
   He said deputies have found parts of the roof at area scrap
companies, ``but the metal was too badly damaged to recover.''
Meanwhile, he said, the tiny rural church is topless.
   Lt. Charlie Frazier, an investigator in the case, said it changes
the concept of theft.
   ``We used to say that they stole everything that wasn't nailed
down,'' he said. ``Well, that roof was nailed down.''

<HEAD>Summit Offered A Forum To Show Off Soviet Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Moscow summit offered the Soviets a forum to
show off Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and a chance to boost the
Kremlin leader on the eve of a Communist Party conference crucial to
the success of his policies.
   While the U.S. media devoted much space and time to the meeting
between President Reagan and Gorbachev, the Soviet media devoted at
least as much space _ if not more _ to discussion of the party
conference and a reform document published on the eve of the summit
that outlines more, potentially radical reforms.
   Soviet television coverage of the summit, meanwhile, portrayed
Gorbachev as a dynamic, sophisticated world leader.
   Reagan helped promote that image during his stay by repeatedly
acknowledging the blossoming of the state-run arts and media,
restructuring of the economy and freeing of some political prisoners
under Gorbachev.
   In fact, Reagan appeared so impressed with Gorbachev's policies
that he withdrew his earlier characterization of the Soviet Union as
an ``evil empire.'' And when it came time for Reagan to leave, he
bid a warm farewell to a leader he said had become a personal friend.
   But the air of good will did not hide the fact that Gorbachev is
waging a battle to win the support of the 5,000 Communist Party
delegates to the national conference, which begins June 28. The
conference is the first of its kind since 1941.
   Gorbachev has said he wants ``partisans of perestroika,'' his
effort to restructure Soviet society, elected as delegates to the
conference. At the same time, the Soviet leader has indicated that
he does not want any party conflicts out in the open, and he
studiously avoided mention of the party conference during the summit.
   But that did not stop Soviet reformers from speaking out about
the fierce fight being waged by orthodox Communists and outspoken
Gorbachev supporters over delegate elections to the conference.
   Some of the liberals ousted as delegates were restored to the
list when the Moscow party hierarchy intervened after the summit.
   Gorbachev, moving straight from summitry to his internal
problems, attended the Moscow party meeting that made the decisions,
but state-run media gave no clue as to whether he spoke out in favor
of the move. They did report, however, that he stressed the
importance of his domestic reforms to the success of the summit with
Reagan.
   Boris Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow Communist party boss dropped
from the ruling Politburo last February, took the most dramatic
step, giving two interviews to Western television stations in which
he called for the resignation of the Kremlin's No. 2 official, Yegor
K. Ligachev.
   Yeltsin is said to have criticized the slow pace of reform in an
unpublished speech last Oct. 21 that led to his ouster. This week,
he took the unprecedented step of using Western interviews to assail
Ligachev for allegedly blocking reform.
   Ligachev himself said Saturday that enemies are trying to divide
a leadership united behind Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``Adversaries in the West, and some people in our country too,
are making allegations about differences among the Soviet
leadership, in the Politburo,'' he said.
   Gorbachev insisted at his news conference last week that there is
no movement to force Ligachev to step down.
   At the same time, however, the pro-reform weekly Ogonyok and the
weekly Moscow News _ available in English, Spanish, French, German
and Arabic as well as Russian _ published candid articles about
maneuvers used to ease reformers off the conference slate.
   Organizers of the Soviet Union's fledgling independent political
party, the Democratic Union founded on May 4, held a meeting of
1,500 people in Leningrad last weekend demanding a multi-party
system and fairer delegate selection.
   Smaller protests on this and other issues, such as Jewish
emigration, took place daily in Moscow during the summit, with
police watching in silence.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of Ogonyok, said Moscow students went to
the city's Pushkin Square last week to collect signatures on a
petition demanding he be a conference delegate.
   Sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, writer Fyodor Burlatsky,
historian Yuri Afanasyev and Korotich told Western reporters in news
conferences or interviews that they failed to gain election as
delegates in an initial round of voting.
   Burlatsky said the problems were due to the fact that ``we are
learning democracy.''
   Korotich, too, blamed the maneuvering on the lack of a political
culture.
   ``We have to learn not to be afraid,'' he said in an interview.
``We have to get rid of the Stalinist remnants. Under Stalin, it was
easy. He had a theory of enemies that made everybody afraid of one
another.''
   Banging on a desk for emphasis, he added, ``If you thought this
desk was bad, you could just say it was made by enemies. Simple as
that.''
   ``Perestroika,'' he added, ``is just a big return to the norm. We
have to become normal again.''
   Foreign Ministry press center officials were swift to accede to
Western reporters' requests for interviews with the most outspoken
proponents of reform, who also took the dais at news conferences for
hundreds of journalists.
   Known conservatives were not seen at such forums, and were not
strongly in evidence at a meeting Reagan had with writers and
intellectuals last Tuesday.
   This could be the result of what Gorbachev himself has described
as passive, panicky resistance to his reforms. This maneuvering has
not so far emerged into a publicly identifiable political movement.
   Korotich also noted that ``the conservatives have not yet
presented a program, and have not suggested any new leader'' to
replace Gorbachev as Communist party general secretary.
   He said he expected Gorbachev to emerge strengthened from the
conference.
   The public relations campaign for Gorbachev's reforms that was
waged during the summit certainly convinced a Moscow taxi driver,
who said he was from the Soviet leader's home region in southern
Russia.
   ``Gorbachev is like Jesus Christ,'' he volunteered to a Western
reporter during a conversation highly critical of Soviet life. ``Our
children have all forgotten how to work, and he will get them going
again.''

   Rescue teams worked Saturday to recover the
bodies of 11 passengers killed in the flaming crash of a military
jet carrying Ecuador's air force chief, two other officers and an
Israeli military attache.
   The aircraft was on fire before it slammed into a mountainside on
the outskirts of this highland capital while preparing to land in
heavy rain and an electrical storm Friday night, witnesses said.
   All 11 on board were killed, including air force chief Gen. Angel
Augusto Flores, two other members of Ecuador's air command, Gen.
Raul Cousin and Gen. Galo Coronel, and Col. Shabtai Ben-Shua,
Israel's military attache in Ecuador. The other dead included six
Ecuadoran air force officers and one corporal.
   Witnesses said the plane split apart after the crash and slid 200
yards down a slope. Part of the wreckage slipped into the
flood-swollen Machangara River, according to witnesses.
   A spokesman for the air force's Air Accident Investigative Board
said investigators suspect the plane may have been struck by a
lightning bolt because the pilot of a plane following the military
jet saw a flash just before the accident.
   The plane was four miles from Quito's international airport when
it hit the mountain on the sparsely populated outskirts of the
capital. It had taken off from the Taura air force base on the
Pacific coast 160 miles southwest of Quito.
   The air force did not provide official information on the exact
model of the aircraft or its manufacturer.

   The presidential primary season ends on Tuesday
in circumstances that scarcely seemed imaginable when it began four
months ago, with Michael Dukakis ready to claim a non-brokered
Democratic nomination and George Bush on the defensive despite
banishing his Republican rivals.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson is the only other contestant left of 13
would-be presidents who toed the starting line last winter. But even
his campaign manager concedes that Dukakis is likely to wrap up the
party's nomination by the end of the week.
   For the record, New Jersey, California, Montana and New Mexico
are holding primary elections on Tuesday, with 466 Democratic
convention delegates at stake and 265 up for grabs on the Republican
side.
   But Bush is unopposed, as he has been for weeks, and he skipped
lightly through the final states on the calendar. Instead, he has
spent the last several days trying to figure out how to end a
downward spiral that has left him trailing Dukakis by double-digit
margins in some national polls.
   ``I've never felt more relaxed, never felt more convinced we're
on the right track,'' he told reporters late last week after four
days of skull sessions with aides and outside advisers.
   The only suspense left in the Democratic primary campaign is
whether Dukakis' expected sweep of the final four contests will give
him the 2,081 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
   ``I hope on Tuesday we will have won the nomination,'' says Susan
Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager. The Massachusetts governor
intends to campaign extensively as the nominee-in-waiting in the
weeks before the convention opens in July, as well as open serious
talks with Jackson and select a running mate.
   The hope among campaign aides is for a display of unity in the
weeks to come from the other primary rivals, including Sen. Paul
Simon, Richard Gephardt and Albert Gore Jr.
   The Republicans have a unity display lined up already.
   The vice president will make an appearance at a ``Unity 88''
conference in Denver late next week, where Sen. Bob Dole, Rep. Jack
Kemp and Pat Robertson _ former rivals _ also will speak.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater says Bush will use his trip to begin
speaking out more forcefully against Dukakis and provide a ``pretty
good taste of the flavor of the campaign for the summer.''
   The last act of the primary season means an end to months of
non-stop campaigning for Jackson, but not an end to the campaign.
   He has been pressing Dukakis on issues ranging from the budget to
policy toward South Africa in recent weeks in an apparent effort to
influence the drafting of the party platform.
   On the topic of the vice presidential nominiation, Dukakis and
Jackson take turns probing and feinting.
   Jackson hasn't said he wants it, but says he's entitled to
consideration.
   Dukakis, under intense pressure from many party regulars to look
elsewhere for a running mate but aware that he needs Jackson's
followers to support him in the fall, praises his rival lavishly and
agrees that he is entitled to consideration. But he says the results
of the primaries do not entitle Jackson to a ``leg up'' on any other
potential running mate.
   Whatever follows, the final days of the primary campaign seemed
almost becalmed.
   Jackson's aides said they were spending about $700,000 on
television in California, and would limit themselves to radio
advertisements in New Jersey. That was about one quarter of the
California budget envisioned three weeks ago when Jackson dreamed of
ambushing Dukakis on the final day of the season.
   Dukakis spent nothing on advertising in New Jersey and less than
$250,000 in California. What money he did spend went to air a
commercial that seemed a preview of the fall campaign. It touted his
efforts to reduce crime in Massachusetts and said he forged his
accomplishments with ``hard work, integrity, leadership. We could
use some of that ... in the White House,'' said the announcer.
   Bush spent no money at all on advertising in the final primary
states. He also curtailed his travel schedule, wary of bumping up
against the $27 million federal spending limit for pre-convention
campaigning.
   That laid-back type of campaigning, particularly in the state
that will provide the largest single block of electoral votes in the
fall, was a marked contrast to the frenzy of early contests.
   Several of the contenders spent roughly $750,000 _ the legal
maximum _ in Iowa alone on the Feb. 8 caucuses that opened the
season.
   Bush finished third in that opening event, well behind Dole and
Robertson. But he dusted himself off, defeated Dole and the rest of
the field in the New Hampshire primary, and the rout was on.
   The vice president effectively locked up the nomination a few
weeks later in a Super Tuesday sweep of 16 primary states on March
8. One by one, his rivals dropped from the field, and the vice
president gained a mathematical lock on the nomination when
Pennsylvania voted on April 26.
   Dukakis finished third, as well, in Iowa, behind Gephardt and
Simon. But he rebounded to win the primary in New Hampshire next
door to his Massachusetts home. In the turbulent weeks of
campaigning that followed, Dukakis carried five primary states on
Super Tuesday, as did Jackson and Gore.
   Simon won his home state primary in Illinois a week later, with
Jackson second and Dukakis third. Jackson dealt Dukakis a stinging
defeat 10 days later in the Michigan caucuses. Talk of a brokered
convention hit a high note.
   But the Massachusetts governor began a strong spring comeback a
few days later in Connecticut, and went on to win nine out of the
next 10 primaries, eliminating his rivals one by one, until only
Jackson remained.

   Who attends the Communist Party conference on
reform June 28 became the subject of backroom political maneuvering
in Moscow, and a delegate list published Saturday showed some of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's supporters lost.
   Official media said late Friday the Moscow party leadership had
restored the names of prominent intellectual reformers dropped from
the list at the precinct level, but the list showed some were not
elected.
   The delegate battle has been the talk of Moscow for days.
State-run media and even political street protests, unusual for the
Soviet Union, brought the internal party battle into the open.
   Gorbachev called the party conference, the first since Josef
Stalin summoned one in 1941, to act on position papers issued in
May. They include limiting the tenure of party officials, separating
party and government structures, and other elements of his
``perestroika'' reform program.
   Among 319 delegates elected in Moscow were Gorbachev and five
other members of the ruling Politburo, including Viktor M.
Chebrikov, chief of the KGB secret police, and Yegor K. Ligachev,
the Kremlin's No. 2 man.
   Media accounts said sharp debates preceded the secret-ballot
election at a Moscow party meeting Friday.
   A list published Saturday in the Moscow's party daily Moskovskaya
Pravda did not include the names of such reformers as sociologist
Tatyana Zaslavskaya, playwright Mikhail Shatrov and economist
Nikolai Shmelev.
   Movie maker Elem Klimov and economist Leonid Abalkin, other
liberals restored, made the final delegate list.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of the pro-reform weekly Ogonyok, was one
Moscow-based reformer eased off the roster, but media reports say
the Ukrainian-born writer will be a delegate for Kherson, a
Ukrainian port city on the Black Sea.
   It was not clear whether other reformers would be chosen as
delegates from outside Moscow. The media have said similar contests
over delegates are occurring in other parts of the country.
   The Moscow party has nearly 1 million members, including the
nation's leading intellectuals and officials.
   Gorbachev himself attended the leadership meeting Friday that
chose the final delegate list after weeks of discussion over who
would attend the conference.
   Moskovskaya Pravda printed only a summary of his remarks and did
not make clear whether Gorbachev spoke in favor of the restored
candidacies or scolded party conservatives for attempting to ease
out reformers.
   Other Politburo members chosen were President Andrei A. Gromyko,
Moscow party boss Lev N. Zaikov and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Defense Minister Dmitri A. Yazov, a non-voting Politburo member,
also was elected.
   More Politburo members probably will represent other parts of the
country. Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, for instance, has
his Communist Party base in the southern republic of Georgia.
   One person not on the list was Boris N. Yeltsin, who was
dismissed as Moscow party chief in November after making a speech to
the national party Central Committee criticizing the pace of reform
as too slow. The speech still has not been published.
   On Monday, Yeltsin took the unprecedented step of using Western
television interviews to call for the resignation of Ligachev, the
No. 2 man, on grounds he is is blocking reform. Gorbachev denied on
Wednesday that Ligachev's removal was a possibility.
   Ligachev often has appeared more cautious about reform than
Gorbachev and is rumored to lead a conservative faction in the party.
   About 5,000 delegates are expected to attend the conference.

   President Reagan should be given an honorary
peerage or similar honor when he leaves office in recognition of his
contribution to world peace, a Conservative lawmaker suggested
Saturday.
   ``I think the whole British nation would rejoice if an honor of
great distinction could be bestowed on him,'' said Harry Greenway, a
member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governing party.
   Greenway noted other foreigners have been included in Britain's
ancient system of honors, titles and awards, most recently former
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger who received an honorary
knighthood in February.
   ``I see no reason why arrangements could not be made for an
honorary peerage to be bestowed on President Reagan, not only in
recognition of his unique special relationship with Britain but also
to mark his massive contribution to world peace,'' Greenway said.
   The Anglo-American relationship has flourished under Reagan and
Mrs. Thatcher, who have struck a close personal friendship to cement
their working alliance.
   Reagan underlined that relationship last week by stopping in
London on his way home from the Moscow summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to give Mrs. Thatcher a briefing. Reagan leaves
office in January.
   Greenway said if Reagan were made an honorary peer, ``such
recognition, unique, bold and breathtaking, would signal how much we
recognize what this great man has done for world peace.''
   British peerages formally are awarded by Queen Elizabeth II,
although most are made on the prime minister's recommendation.
   Unlike British peers, honorary peers are not entitled to sit in
the House of Lords.
   Weinberger was the 56th American to receive an honorary
knighthood.
   Other Americans with the honor include actors Douglas Fairbanks
Jr. and Sidney Poitier, former U.S. Ambassador Walter Annenberg,
former Sen. William Fulbright, philanthropists Paul Mellon and John
Paul Getty II, industrialist Henry Ford III, and Dean Rusk, a former
secretary of state.
   Weinberger received his honorary knighthood for being ``a staunch
friend to Britain, remembered most of all for his unfailing support
and assistance during the Falklands War,'' the Foreign Office said
at the time.
   The United States provided naval intelligence and political
support to Britain during its victory over Argentina in a 74-day war
over the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.

   Arabs shut down the occupied lands for a second
day Saturday to protest the Middle East tour of Secretary of State
George Shultz, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he still
opposes the U.S. peace plan.
   Israeli soldiers breaking up a protest shot a 55-year-old Arab
woman in the hand in the Gaza Strip's Nusseirat refugee camp, a
local reporter said. The army confirmed the injury and said it was
investigating the circumstances.
   Stores were closed and public transport halted in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a rebellion against Israeli rule
began six months ago among the 1.5 million Palestinian residents.
The strike also paralyzed Arab east Jerusalem.
   Curfews and closures continued for at least six towns and refugee
camps with 120,000 Arab residents.
   In Tel Aviv, about 5,000 Israelis marched to support ending the
occupation in exchange for peace.
   Fights started when police arrested a woman wearing a dress with
the design of the Palestinian flag, which Israel has outlawed.
Police said eight people were arrested.
   ``There was a problem with the woman, who was asked to take the
flag off her body,'' said a police spokesman, whose name was
withheld in keeping with regulations. ``Her friends tried to prevent
her arrest.''
   Witnesses said police punched and clubbed photographers who took
pictures of the incident.
   Witnesses said passersby shouted insults and spat on the marchers.
   At Shuyukh village, near Hebron in the West Bank, about 250
residents marched in memory of 20-year-old Mustafa Ahmed Halaika,
who was shot to death Friday. Members of his family accused young
Jewish settlers of the killing, and Israeli authorities said they
were investigating.
   An army officer killed another Palestinian later Friday when
Arabs surrounded and stoned his military patrol in Tzafa village,
near Ramallah north of Jerusalem, the army said.
   At least 201 Palestinians have been killed since riots began Dec.
8 in the territories Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 war, a six-day confict that began 21 years ago Sunday. An
Israeli soldier and a Jewish settler also have been slain.
   Shamir told Israel radio he still opposes the U.S. proposal for
an international peace conference and does not expect a breakthrough
while Shultz is in the region. He also opposes trading land for
peace, the other essential part of the American plan.
   The prime minister said of Shultz: ``He has a very difficult
mission. He is entitled to encouragement but we must be frank with
him. We can't nurture illusions.''
   He said the secretary, on his fourth visit to the Middle East in
five months, had undertaken a ``very ambitious plan.'' Shultz began
his tour Friday in Cairo, visited Amman on Saturday and is due here
Sunday.
   ``Is is known that Americans excel in their spirit of optimism,
and we should learn from their optimism, but this optimism should
not blind one's eyes,'' Shamir said.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Shamir's partner and rival in the
tenuous government coalition, supports an international conference,
but his political adviser Nimrod Novik said little could be done
before Israeli elections in November.
   Shultz should try to ``sustain the momentum and work on the
(peace) package, so that once the decision is made by the Israeli
electorate in November the package is ready,'' Novik said.
   Shamir leads the right-wing Likud bloc and Peres heads the
center-left Labor Party.
   The Palestinian uprising has become the central election issue.
Its underground leaders called the three-day general strike to
protest the U.S. peace plan because it does not include an
independent Palestinian state.
   On Saturday leaflets began circulating in the West Bank and Gaza
signed by the Islamic Resistance Movement, which broke with the
regular underground leadership earlier this year.
   They called June the ``month of damnation to the occupation'' and
declared: ``We should continue the uprising for a long time. We
should not heed any voices calling for ending the uprising or making
it less important.''
   Palestinians should use ``stones, slingshots, sticks, Molotov
cocktails and empty hands'' to resist Israeli rule, the leaflets
said.
   Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, Israeli commander in the Gaza Strip,
urged residents to ignore the war anniversary. He promised better
living conditions and relief from curfews in areas that remain quiet
and said summer visits from relatives abroad would be forbidden in
trouble spots.

<TEXT>
   Police have evicted hundreds of people
from their cardboard and tin homes in Panama City and ordered them
to burn the shacks, saying the squatters had invaded private
property.
   Many of the victims were people who had lost their jobs during
the past few months as Panama's economy went into a tailspin because
of the political crisis brought on by the confrontation between the
Reagan administration and Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the head of
Panama's Defense Forces.
   ``We came here because we had nowhere else to go,'' said Angelina
Concepcion, a mother of two, as she gathered some of her few
belongings early Saturday and piled them by the side of a road.
   Police who began the evictions Friday night stood by and watched
as she worked. They refused to talk to journalists and barred
photographers from the area.
   Residents said the police ordered them to leave and said the
shanties would be burned down. Police then set fire to some of the
one-room structures, according to the victims.
   ``I made mine out of wood because they told us we could stay if
we built good homes,'' said Evangelista Samaniego whose building was
set ablaze in the open, swampy zone.
   Early Saturday crews sent from the company that owns the land and
trucks from the Housing Ministry were helping residents move their
belongings to other areas where some said they were told they could
rebuild.
   Housing Ministry and company officials were not available for
comment.
   Many squatters said they had not been given any notice that they
would have to leave and had been led to believe they could
eventually settle in the district. They had installed a water pipe
from the street.
   The pipeline was removed by police.
   ``If they wanted the land, they could have told us and given us
some time to move. They should not have done it this way,'' said
Leonel Mora. He said he had moved his family into the area two
months ago after he lost his job and had to leave a house he rented
for $50 a month.
   Many people have lost their jobs and there is a critical
shortager of money becasuse of the economic sanctions imposed by the
United States in an effort to force Noriega, the power behind the
civilian government, to resign and leave Panama.
   Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida in
February that accused him of drug trafficking. The general has
denied the allegations and rejected the U.S. appeals that he quit as
head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces.

   Three small planes chartered by the United
Nations flew in and out of the embattled northern Somalia town of
Haregeisa on Saturday to evacuate 160 foreigners stranded there.
   Diplomats said 20 Americans were among the foreigners, most
employed by relief or development agencies, caught in a battle for
the town between rebels and government forces.
   The U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, capital of Somalia, issued a
statement saying all of the foreigners wanting to leave were
``expected to be out of Hargeisa by today (Saturday). They will be
taken to Mogadishu for the moment.''
   The U.N. Development Program hired three light aircraft to ferry
the foreigners from Hargeisa, 600 miles north of Mogadishu, to
Garowe. From Garowe, thet were to be taken to the capital by air or
road.
   The airlift began Friday, three days after rebels of the Somali
National Movement claimed to have captured Hargeisa, and officials
said 83 foreigners were taken out Friday. The rebels have been
fighting to overthrow the government for seven years.

   Iraq reported it attacked a tanker moored
at an Iranian oil terminal Saturday and Iran claimed its forces
repelled an Iraqi attempt to regain captured land in the northern
mountains.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
fighter-bombers scored ``a direct and effective hit on a large
maritime target'' in the tanker holding area near Iran's Kharg
Island in the northern Persian Gulf.
   The agency, quoting a military communique, did not identify the
vessel.
   There was no confirmation from gulf-based shipping officials or
Iran.
   The Iraqi agency quoted a military spokesman as saying the attack
was part of the campaign to deprive Iran of ``oil revenues used to
finance its war effort.'' Iran and Iraq have been at war since
September 1980.
   The air strike was the first Iraqi shipping raid reported in
three weeks. The last attack was May 14, when Iraq's French-built
Mirage F-1 jets bombed tankers off Iran's Larak island terminal in
the southern gulf.
   Five tankers were set ablaze in that raid. The 235,000-ton
Spanish supertanker Barcelona later exploded and sank. The
564,739-ton Liberian-flagged Seawise Giant was badly damaged.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, said Revolutionary Guards and Iraqi dissident forces killed
or wounded 200 Iraqi troops in repelling an attack on positions in
the Shemiran mountains in northeast Iraq on Friday.
   The Iranians and Kurdish guerrilla allies seized the heights in
the Darbandikhan region of Kurdistan in February.
   There was no word from Iraq on fighting in that region.
   Iraq has been expected to launch assaults in that area following
its success in driving the Iranians out of two other key footholds
on Iraqi soil _ the southern Faw Peninsula on April 18 and a
bridgehead east of the southern port of Basra May 25.
   In another development, Austrian President Kurt Waldheim arrived
in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Saturday on a state visit. The rest of his
planned gulf tour was scrapped because of a scheduled Arab summit
conference on the Palestinian issue.
   Leaders of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, who were to
receive him in their capitals, were leaving for the summit which is
opening in Algiers on Tuesday.
   The Saudi monarch, King Fahd, will fly to the Algerian capital
just as Waldheim is concluding his three-day visit to the kingdom.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate state
Rep. Bob Williams and his pilot escaped injury when their
single-engine private plane crash-landed on a highway near the
Olympia Airport.
   State Rep. Bob Williams, 46, and pilot Dan Pryor, 38, were on
their way to Olympia from Long Beach when the accident occurred
Friday evening, Pryor said.
   The pilot said he had cut power while approaching the airport,
then tried to abort his landing but was unable to get enough power
to go around for another landing attempt.
   The 30-year-old Cessna 175 gradually lost altitude until it
clipped a row of 3-foot-tall trees on a tree farm, and slid sideways
about 40 feet before coming to rest on the highway.
   Pryor estimated the plane was traveling 30 mph when it hit the
ground.
   Pryor, of Olympia, said the plane ``simply choked out'' and he
could offer no further explanation for the engine trouble.
   Williams, of Longview, said one car passed at the time of the
accident and the driver checked to see if anyone was injured before
leaving to notify authorities.

   Hundreds of prison inmates cheered,
whistled and clapped Saturday as Nobel laureate Mother Teresa told
them, ``You are precious to me.''
   ``It's very important for you to share that joy of loving _ that
little smile, some compassion,'' the founder of the Missionaries of
Charity religious order told inmates at the medium-security state
prison here. ``It will help you stay together and stay beautiful.''
   Her more than two-hour visit to the prison included a brief stop
with inmates in protective custody, among them Rod Matthews, the
16-year-old Canton youth convicted of killing a classmate.
   Mother Teresa, 77, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work
with the poor. Her missionary order runs 360 shelters around the
world staffed by 3,500 nuns, but she brushed aside reporters'
questions about her achievements.
   ``It's not my work,'' she said. ``I'm just a little instrument in
(God's) hands.''
   She was invited to the state by an inmate at the Walpole
maximum-security prison who has been corresponding with her for two
years. She was to have a private talk with him later in the day and
also visit a women's prison.
   Many of the inmates who attended the Mass at Concord joined in
singing hymns and appeared genuinely moved by the service.
   ``I haven't seen this much compassion and love in 20 years of
corrections work,'' said state Correction Commissioner Michael V.
Fair. ``It's very exciting. This is a great healing day for our
department.''
   The prisoners were most emotional after Mother Teresa's 15-minute
address, which she ended by telling them: ``I will not forget you. I
have you in the palm of my hand. You are precious to me. I love
you.''
   ``I've got goose bumps all over my body,'' said inmate Bobby
Cowan, 25. ``I never felt anything like it. I could do another 10
years and it wouldn't bother me because of this.''
   Another inmate, Albert Fortin, 25, said: ``I was so touched when
she walked through the room. I almost cried, but I didn't want to in
front of a room full of men.''
   At a news conference with Cardinal Bernard Law before the Mass,
Mother Teresa said the crimes committed by the prisoners do not make
them unworthy of love, adding ``we are all sinners.''
   ``We must accept people who are here and we must help them be at
peace while they're here,'' she said.
   Mother Teresa's visit to the three prisons was prompted by a
47-year-old inmate at the maximum-security prison in Walpole who
began corresponding with her two years ago and invited her to visit
last fall.
   The inmate, Donald Ouimet, is serving an 18- to 20-year sentence
for assault and battery. He told reporters that he is a former lay
brother in a Capuchin Franciscan monastery.
   According to Springfield newspapers, Ouimet and his former wife
lured minors to their West Springfield home and sexually assaulted
them.
   In response to questions about the victims of some of the inmates
in the prisons, Mother Teresa said she would ``pray for them.''
   ``It is hard for the families (of the victims),'' she said. ``I
think it's very hard.''

<HEAD>Seattle Fast-Food Restaurant Worker Found To Have Hepatitis A</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 5,200 persons may have been exposed to
hepatitis A last month because a worker at a fast-food restaurant
unknowingly had the liver disease, health officials said.
   Health officials said that the unidentified worker at a Wendy's
Restaurant on Pacific Highway in south Seattle was diagnosed as
having the disease Friday.
   As a precaution, patrons were urged to get an injection of immune
globulin, which contains antibodies to the virus and could forestall
the illness, if they had eaten at the restaurant recently.
   Those who had eaten there more than two weeks earlier would not
benefit from the injections, because immune globulin must be
received no later than 14 days after exposure to be effective, said
Lois Schipper, nurse epidemiologist for the Seattle-King County
Health Department.
   Officials estimated the number of people who could have eaten at
the restaurant during the times the worker was there at 5,200.
   Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can range from
mild to life-threatening. Hepatitis A is caused by a virus that can
be passed by an infected person touching food with unclean hands or
through food or water contaminated with fecal material.
   Symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite,
fatigue, sore muscles, dark urine, light-colored stools and yellow
skin or eyes. The incubation period is two weeks to six weeks.
   The Wendy's restaurant worker is the latest of more than 75 food
handlers diagnosed with the disease during the past three years in
the Puget Sound area, where there has been a hepatitis epidemic.

   The best man at Terry Lee Griffith's wedding
Saturday had three tails. One was his own.
   Griffith's best man was a horse.
   The Delaware horse trainer said he picked his thoroughbred race
horse, The Maltese Cat, as best man because the horse, which he
purchased with three other horses in 1986 for $1,250, won more than
$40,000 for Griffith, pulling him from near bankruptcy.
   ``He was good to me,'' said the 44-year-old trainer.
   Although The Maltese Cat stood by, a human couple witnessed the
simple Christian ceremony for Griffith and his bride, Kathleen
Boutin, in the tree-bordered paddock at Delaware Park raceway.
   The couple share an interest in horses. The two met at a feed
store in April 1987.
   ``From there, we just started horsing around,'' said Griffith.
   The 6-year-old thoroughbred was better dressed at the wedding
than his owner. Griffith donned a grey suit, but The Maltese Cat was
clad in formal wear, including a top hat, white shirt and white
socks.
   The bride wore a gown of aqua over white and rode a _ what else?
_ horse-drawn carriage to the ceremony.

   Angola is threatening peace
negotiations by massing equipment and soldiers, including Cubans,
near its border with South-West Africa, the military said Saturday.
   The Foreign Ministry declared earlier in the day that future
talks must be held in Africa and said Angola should apologize to the
Congo for trying to change the venue.
   Angola said Thursday the next meetings on peace in Angola and
South-West Africa, also called Namibia, would be held in Europe.
   Cuba and the United States also are involved in the talks, which
began May 3 in London. Their aim is to get foreign soldiers out of
Angola, end the civil war there and achieve independence for
neighboring South-West Africa, which South Africa controls in
defiance of U.N. resolutions..
   On May 18, South Africa and Angola followed up the previous talks
with discussions in Brazzaville, Congo, and then the argument began
over a site for future meetings.
   The South African military statement Saturday spoke of ``a
provocative and aggressive buildup of forces in South Angola ...
which prove the Cubans are obviously not displaying any seriousness
toward the peace negotiations.''
   Some South African troops remain in Angola, helping
U.S.-supported rebels fight the Marxist government and a Cuban force
of at least 40,000 soldiers stationed in the country. Rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA,
are not involved in the peace talks.
   Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, South Africa's military commander, said
May 26 that Cuban and Angolan troops were moving south toward the
frontier with South-West Africa. South African soldiers regularly
cross into southern Angola to attack guerrilla bases of SWAPO, the
South-West African People's Organization.
   In the statement Saturday, the military said Cubans, Angolans and
SWAPO guerrillas had occupied nine more towns near the border,
supported by tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery.
   It said SWAPO used the protection of the Cuban-Angolan buildup to
move its headquarters closer to the Namiobian border.
   Guerrillas were seen in Cuban uniforms and were using vehicles
disguised as South African to abduct Namibian children, the
statement claimed. It said ``whites with long hair ... which could
possibly point to Russian ... soldiers or East Germans'' had been
seen in Umfilo, 25 miles from the border.

<TEXT>
   During coffee breaks and
after dinner, alone, in groups, or with their children,
superintendents of America's national parks wandered over to a small
plaque on the wall of Jackson Lake Lodge during their convention,
which ended Sunday.
   As they read the congressional mandate that created their agency
72 years ago, they inevitably looked out the floor-to-ceiling
windows next to the plaque to stare in silence at the majestic Teton
Mountains, protected forever by a national park.
   The purpose of the parks, the mandate says, ``is to conserve the
scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife
therein and to provide for the same ... in such manner ... as will
leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.''
   ``This is what it's all about,'' said Dick Marks, chief of Grand
Canyon National Park in Arizona. ``I look out there and I'm inspired
to do a better job. I look around this room and I know 75 percent of
the people. I have memories of them, not as just friends, but of
what they've accomplished. Each represents some portion of my 27
years in the park service.''
   Repeatedly during the first general superintendent's conference
held by the National Park Service in 12 years, park managers
embraced colleagues they hadn't seen for years and greeted with hugs
the families of long-ago co-workers.
   The four-day meeting was packed with business sessions.
Politicians, Interior Department bureaucrats, and experts lecturing
on issues relevant to running the parks dominated the schedule.
   But the gathering called by NPS Director William Penn Mott for
his 342 superintendents, 10 regional directors, and dozens of
Washington, D.C., staff members was more of a family reunion than a
business convention.
   Two young rangers who served with him at the Blue Ridge Parkway
in June 1961 joined Dick Marks as top managers at the convention.
   ``These people are more than associates, they are family,'' said
Marks, a hint of a tear in his eye. ``I will use them as sounding
boards to help me solve problems. When we sit down and talk
together, they remind me of the things that brought me into the
service, the dedication to the mission of protecting our best
resources.''
   They were brought together to talk of issues, such as planning
for the 21st century, but they were also told to have a good time.
   ``I felt bringing everybody together for inspiration and
education, and for getting acquainted with each other as a total
national park system, would be a highly desirable thing to do for
the morale of the organization and for the consolidation of our
commitment,'' said Mott.
   The 78-year-old director, who said he's taken three weekends off
during his three-year tenure, built a free afternoon into the
schedule so his managers and their families could get outdoors in
Grand Teton National Park and nearby Yellowstone National Park.
   Alan O'Neill, superintendent at Lake Mead National Recreation
Area in Arizona and Nevada, got to take his first rafting trip in
years.
   Bob Heyder, superintendent at Mesa Verde National Park in
Colorado, took his wife, Kathy, and daughter, Gretchen, hiking, the
first time the family has taken a walk together ``in ages,'' said
his wife.
   Marks took a sack lunch and sat on a rock, then took a walk.
Asked to recall the last time he had two hours by himself in the
outdoors, Marks thought for a minute, then replied: ``I can't
remember.''
   Chrysandra ``Sandy'' Walter, superintendent at Lowell National
Historical Park in Massachussetts, said, ``Being together in this
beautiful place has given us time to reflect on what the National
Park Service means to the United States and what it stands for in
the world ... I've had my `family' around me, including four of the
ranger recruits I went through basic training with nearly 20 years
ago who are now superintendents.''
   Robin Winks, a history professor at Yale University and a
passionate visitor to more than 300 of the 342 units in the system,
told the superintendents Thursday, ``You begin to get into a heart
of a people by what they have chosen to preserve.''
   Mott said America's park stewards are a dedicated corps of
``elite'' men and women. There is an average six-year wait for a
seasonal ranger to become a permanent employee. Within the service,
which has about 16,000 full-time workers, the annual turnover rate,
including retirement, is 2 percent.
   ``This week has been almost like a religious retreat,'' said
Heyder. ``I'm going away refreshed and inspired.''
   Like the other superintendents, Heyder faces a summer of
anticipated record crowds, maintenance problems that include
everything from overflowing toilets to chuckholes in the roads, and
too much work to do with too little money.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 150 Slovenian youths have
established a committee to help defend a political activist who was
arrested on suspicion of revealing military secrets, a committee
member said Saturday.
   He said the committee sent a letter to President Raif Dizdarevic
demanding the release of Janez Jansa, who was arrested Tuesday in
Ljubljana after reporting alleged plans for a military coup in the
northern republic of Slovenia.
   A journalist and one of four candidates for president of the
Slovenian Socialist Youth Union, Jansa had published a number of
articles in liberal periodicals criticizing army policies.
   In one he said the military planned a coup in Slovenia to quell
dissent in Yugoslavia's most liberal republic. That report was
denied last week by the government.
   A committee member, speaking with the condition he not be
identified, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
Ljubljana that Jansa has refused to be represented by a military
lawyer and apparently has decided to defend himself at his trial.
   In a statement issued Friday, the Slovenian Socialist Youth Union
said information about Jansa's detention was ``insufficient and
contradictory, which leads us to doubt the correctness of the
procedure.''
   The army has said Jansa is being held at a military prison, but
has refused to release details about his arrest.

<TEXT>
   Just 24 days short of his 80th birthday, William
R. Schumacher on Saturday became the oldest man ordained as a Roman
Catholic priest in U.S. history.
   Schumacher, the father of six, the grandfather of 13 and the
great-grandfather of one, became the father of a much larger family
in a two-hour service at his hometown church.
   ``What he's taught all of us is, there's nothing you can't do if
you really want to do it _ he believes that,'' said Fran Lipton, 48,
Schumacher's daughter. She attended the service with her five
brothers and several of the new priest's grandchildren.
   Wearing a simple white robe, the bespectacled white-haired
widower was ordained into the priesthood by Bishop Thomas Tschoepe
of Dallas. Tschoepe gave Schumacher a chance after he was rejected
by scores of others because of his age.
   Schumacher shrugged off his historic status, which was confirmed
by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. ``Being a priest is
all that concerned me,'' he said after the ceremony at St. Tarcissus
Roman Catholic Church.
   The service culminated a childhood dream for Schumacher, who
first took steps to attend a seminary when he was 17, but deferred
his plans to care for his widowed mother. Then he got married and
had a family of his own.
   A few weeks after his wife of 52 years, Genevieve, died in 1984,
Schumacher telephoned the Chicago archdiocese and said he wanted to
be a priest.
   ``That's when I knew I was released,'' Schumacher said. ``I no
longer had responsibility because the kids were all taking care of
themselves.
   ``I was then free to do what I originally wanted to do.''
   But officials in Chicago turned him down, saying he was 35 years
beyond the cutoff age of 40 for archdiocesan sponsorship.
   After 49 Catholic dioceses either rejected or ignored letters
from Schumacher, Tschoepe promised to give him an assignment in his
diocese.
   Tschoepe's backing allowed Schumacher to enter the seminary, and
in May, he graduated from Holy Apostles Seminary in Cromwell, Conn.
   ``Bill impresses me as a vigorous man of about 60 or so,'' said
Tschoepe, 72.
   A man almost 80 years old ``can be a good priest,'' the bishop
said. ``With the experience they have they can be very, very
effective, especially in counseling, and their understanding of what
other people are going through is one of `I've been there.'''
   Though he will serve in Dallas, Schumacher requested to be
ordained in his neighborhood church, where he had been a lay leader
for 31 years.
   About 300 people attended the service, and scores of parishioners
lined up in the church's reception hall afterwards to be blessed by
the new priest. Schumacher embraced them one-by-one, praying,
laughing and talking with them.
   As a priest, Schumacher's main responsibilities will be working
with the elderly and sick people.
   Schumacher married in 1931 while enrolled in law school, but he
quit his legal studies with less than a year to go because of
economic responsibilities of caring for a wife and baby during the
Depression.
   For the next four decades, Schumacher pursued various careers in
Chicago including insurance broker, politician, credit manager, and
job counselor for the state of Illinois.
   After retiring from his government job at the age of 68,
Schumacher became a travel agent, a career he continued until he
applied for the seminary, Mrs. Lipton said.
   ``As I was watching the service I thought, my mother would have
been proud to be there; but of course if she was there he wouldn't
have been,'' she said.

<HEAD>Jackson Urges Tighter Restrictions On Pesticides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>McFARLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, campaigning in an
agricultural community with an unusually high rate of child cancer
cases, called Saturday for tighter federal restrictions on
pesticides that may be carcinogenic.
   ``We should not use any untested pesticides,'' he said, adding
that people who work in sprayed fields are being ``used as guinea
pigs.''
   The Democratic presidential candidate, joined by several
celebrities from Los Angeles and United Farm Workers leader Cesar
Chavez, led a march by more than 1,500 people through the modest
McFarland residential area where a ``cancer cluster'' has been
identified.
   ``Today in McFarland we focus on the right to breathe, the right
to drink water, the right to a clean environment,'' Jackson said at
a rally.
   Jackson, campaigning in the final days before California's
Tuesday primary, called for federal financing to find the cause of
the cancers, set up a free clinic for treatment and education, and
``close the data gap'' on pesticides about which little is known.
   A state study identified 12 cases of child cancer including six
deaths between 1975 and this year in McFarland, a town of 6,500
people in California's central agricultural valley.
   Many of the children came from the same heavily Hispanic
neighborhoods, and 80 percent of their fathers worked in the fields
as compared to 45 percent of the fathers in a control group, the
study said.
   Some community residents say there are more cancer cases, and
that the government was too conservative in assessing the size of
the cluster.
   The cause of the cancer has not been determined. The state found
no evidence to link the problem to water, but there is an ongoing
investigation into field pesticides that were heavily sprayed on the
fields in 1980-1982, said the state Department of Health Services.
   Chavez told the rally: ``The use of the pesticides is the cause
of all the problems in McFarland and there is no other cause.''
   Chavez has not endorsed a presidential candidate but many of
those who joined Jackson's march were from the UFW and their red
flags dominated the scene.
   Chavez said Jackson is ``a good friend'' and ``the only candidate
that will not fudge on issues.''
   Also marching were a handful of Los Angeles gang members who met
with Jackson earlier in the week, and celebrities including Bonnie
Raitt, Ned Beatty, Margot Kidder, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Kim Fields,
and Carl Weathers, whose movie title ``Action Jackson'' has become
one of the candidate's slogans.
   Jackson said he came to McFarland because its plight reflects
environmental problems in other areas.
   ``Why are we here? ... We are not finger-pointing, we are
embracing, we are reaching out. The whole nation must be
concerned,'' he said.
   Residents interviewed along the march seemed pleased Jackson was
calling attention to their situation.
   ``We want him to help the cancer victims,'' said bystander
Zenaida Murguia who speaks no English and came out with her husband
and two small children. She said they know the families of the
children who died.
   Jackson is ``the only candidate that has taken an interest in
this thing,'' said Fernando Gil, a postal clerk from nearby Delano,
who said he was undecided whether to vote for Jackson or
front-runner Michael Dukakis on Tuesday.
   Jackson has made the McFarland situation a priority item in his
campaign in recent days. This was his third visit to the town.
   He sees the issue as typifying a range of concerns, including his
calls to shift government priorities toward people who have no
resources, pay more attention to safety and health issues, improve
the lot of Hispanic field workers and demand responsibility from
corporations for the environmental and health effects of their
activities.
   Jackson told reporters that President Reagan, Vice President
George Bush and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee
Thomas, ``should be here today.''

   Temperatures soared to record highs in the northern Plains on
Saturday, while thunderstorms were scattered in the Gulf Coast
region and small hail fell in New Jersey.
   Early afternoon readings reached into the 90s in North Dakota,
eastern Montana and northeast Wyoming, and record highs were set or
tied Saturday for the second day in a row.
   Saturday's record highs for the date included 95 degrees at
Billings, Mont.; 94 at Bismarck, N.D.; 92 at Pocatello, Idaho; and
94 at Williston, N.D.
   Temperatures were around 100 degrees across the desert Southwest.
   Dry weather prevailed across most of the nation Saturday
afternoon. But showers and thunderstorms were scattered from
south-central Texas across the central Gulf Coast region, and in the
mid-Atlantic states, and showers continued in southern New England.
   Thundershowers were scattered over the mountains of northern New
Mexico and southern Colorado. A few showers fell along the northern
and central Pacific Coast.
   Pea-sized hail was reported around noon in northern New Jersey
and near Reading, Pa.
   A high-wind warning was posted for Saturday afternoon over
east-central Nevada, and a wind advisory for the rest of Nevada.
Wind gusting to 56 mph was clocked Saturday morning at Eureka, Nev.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Nantucket, Mass., to 103 degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz., and
Needles, Calif.
   The low for the nation Saturday morning was 30 degrees at
Houlton, Maine.
   The National Weather Service forecast scattered showers and
thunderstorms Sunday across Florida, southern Georgia and southern
Alabama. It also predicted scattered showers in New York state and
New England, and from the northern and central Pacific Coast to the
northern Rockies.
   Most of the nation was forecast to have high temperatures in the
70s or 80s, with highs in the 60s in Maine and New Hampshire, and
across Washington, Oregon, northern California and western Nevada.
Temperatures should reach the 90s to near 100 degrees in the
southern and central Rockies and the northern Plains, with readings
in the upper 90s to near 110 degrees across the desert Southwest.

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis suggested Saturday that the Reagan administration
had fumbled an effort to remove Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega from
office by failing to work with allies in the region.
   Dukakis, resuming his campaign schedule after his wife's spinal
surgery, charged there was ``great anger'' among leaders of Latin
America democracies over the administration's failure to consult
them.
   ``Three respected former presidents of Venezuela, Costa Rica and
Colombia had been working hard together with Spain to arrange for
Noriega's departure,'' Dukakis said at a news conference. ``To the
best of my knowledge their efforts were either unnoticed or
unremarked by the current administration.
   ``Their efforts to provide for Noriega's departure did not
succeed as a result,'' Dukakis said.
   In the final weekend of the 1988 presidential primary campaign,
Dukakis edged slowly closer to the magic 2,081 delegates needed to
clinch the Democratic nomination. The Associated Press count gave
him 1,811 to Jesse Jackson's 985. The Dukakis campaign is confident
the four final primaries on Tuesday, with 466 delegates up for
grabs, will put him over the top.
   Jackson, Dukakis' only remaining rival, campaigned in McFarland,
Calif., a largely Hispanic city of 6,500 that has lost six children
to cancer. Jackson called for increased state and federal
involvement in determining the cause of the mysterious cancers.
Jackson also planned a Hollywood fund-raising gala Saturday night.
   At a rally in McFarland, Jackson called for tighter federal
restrictions on pesticides that may be carcinogenic, saying people
who work in sprayed fields are being ``used as guinea pigs.''
   ``Today in McFarland we focus on the right to breathe, the right
to drink water, the right to a clean environment,'' Jackson said at
a rally.
   Republican Vice President George Bush spent the day at home in
Washington before heading to California for a three-day countdown to
the primary season end.
   The Massachusetts governor, a major advocate of the regional
peace plan proposed by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, called it
``inconceivable'' for a U.S. administration to fail to talk with
leaders of those nations if it is serious about promoting democracy
in the region.
   He said their plan involved getting Noriega to leave Panama and
go to Spain.
   He said he did not know details of what went on within the
administration, but said, ``I know from my own consultations with
Latin American leaders that there was no consultation of any
significance between the administration and the democratically
elected chiefs of state on this issue.''
   ``To the best of my knowledge there has been little or no
consultation and there is great anger, I might add, among
democratically elected chiefs of state in Central and South America
at the failure of our government to consult with them,'' he told
reporters.
   The State Department announced two weeks ago that negotiations
with Noriega, including the dismissal of drug trafficking charges
against him, had collapsed.
   In his first events since his wife Kitty's operation to repair
herniated discs in her back, Dukakis spoke to a rally in a park in
the shadow of nearby Philadelphia by the Cooper River, where
pollution has been cleaned up.
   Dukakis stressed themes of family, the environment and of
combatting drugs _ all issues the Dukakis campaign hopes will appeal
to suburban swing voters, not just in New Jersey's primary next
Tuesday but in the fall against Republican George Bush as well.
   ``I spent a little time with Kitty,'' Dukakis told the crowd of
about 400 people. ``She appears to be OK and the operation appears
to be a success. I'm married to a very strong woman, and I'm proud
of her. ... She's going to be up and around in the next six to eight
weeks.''
   Mrs. Dukakis walked for the first time Saturday morning, and
Dukakis said her hip, where doctors removed bone grafts to place in
her back, was ``very painful'' and would be that way for four or
five days.
   Mrs. Dukakis' surgery on Friday was to replace two herniated
discs which doctors said, if uncorrected, could have led to
paralysis.
   The Massachusetts governor cited his wife's medical problem in
his appeal for family values, saying crises such as these make a
person ``think even more about things that are very precious to us.
... One of those things is family.''
   He cited the Cooper River clean-up in stressing that the
environment would be a budget priority in his administration.
   ``Is it going to be Star Wars or a clean ocean?'' he said,
referring to President Reagan's nuclear defense initiative.

   An explosion shook the
headquarters building of a volunteer regiment hours after South
Africa's deadliest bombing in more than a year, police said Saturday.
   Police reported that an explosive device on the ground floor of
the South African Irish Regiment headquarters in downtown
Johannesburg went off at 11:18 p.m. Friday. That was 10 hours after
a bomb in the city of Roodeport killed four people and injured 19.
   No one was injured and damage was slight at the offices of the
regiment, a volunteer citizens' force connected to the South African
Defense Force.
   Police said they were not sure what type of explosive was used,
but were investigating the possibility it was a Soviet-made limpet
mine.
   A limpet mine exploded at lunchtime Friday in Roodeport, west of
Johannesburg. That bomb had been placed in a trash can at the city's
busiest intersection.
   Officials blamed the African National Congress, which has waged a
bombing and sabotage campaign to topple the white-controlled
government since the mainly-black anti-apartheid organization was
banned in 1961.
   The ANC does not comment on individual bombings, but said in a
statement from Lusaka, Zambia, Friday, ``The month of June must be a
period of united and decisive popular offensive'' against the
government.
   By South African law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially
segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A school bus driver en route to an awards ceremony
to get a safe-driving award, turned a corner too sharply and
overturned the bus carrying 29 other school bus drivers.
   Lillie Baltrip and 16 of her passengers went to the hospital
after the accident, but no one was seriously injured, said Larry
Yawn, a spokesman for the Houston Independent School District.
   Superintendent Joan Raymond noted the irony of the timing but
otherwise was not amused. ``There is nothing funny about it,'' she
said.
   In light of recent accidents involving school buses, Ms. Raymond
said the district will give more effort to retraining bus drivers
and monitoring driver performance.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of birdwatchers
have gathered in this small island off the Scottish coast for a
glimpse of a rare visitor that is believed to have traveled 6,000
miles from Siberia.
   ``The bird is most probably a Pallas's Rosefinch, which has never
been recorded in Britain before,'' said Eric Meek, an official of
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
   The finch, which looks like a large, brightly colored sparrow,
summers in Siberia and winters in southern China and Japan.
   British birdwatchers are informed about the sighting of unusual
species by a telephone service named Birdline.
   ``More than 300 birdwatchers have come in and we are expecting
others,'' said Meek.
   The bird probably was helped along by recent easterly winds, said
Kevin Woodbridge, the bird observatory warden on North Ronaldsay, an
island two miles long and three miles wide 55 miles off Scotland's
north coast.
   He said a rarely seen Spanish sparrow, also possibly from eastern
Asia, was spotted on the island earlier this week.

   Actor Paul Newman reflected on his new camp
for seriously ill children Saturday, saying the charitable venture
has helped him regain the enthusiasm of his youth.
   ``I'm pretty cool,'' Newman said during a 35-minute interview
with The Associated Press at the camp. ``I've seen a lot. I've been
through a lot. I lost my cool today ... I recaptured the enthusiasm
of my youth. This is awesome.''
   The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a $17 million project including
the camp facilities and an endowment, was initiated by Newman in
1986 and is scheduled to open for children this month.
   Newman's food company, Newman's Own Inc., donated $7 million to
the camp. He raised another $7 million from donations. A.E.
Hotchner, a business partner and close friend, said Saturday that
another $3 million is needed to complete the endowment for the camp.
   While the fund-raising continues, Newman is defending against a
lawsuit by a Westport delicatessan owner who claims he was promised
8 percent of the stock from the food company. The plaintiff's lawyer
accused Newman in court in Bridgeport Friday of misrepresenting a
profit-mkaing food company as a charity. Newman dismissed the
allegations as being without merit.
   ``And the money going to the lawyers could have been used for a
more productive purpose, like giving an ambulance to a hospital,''
he said.
   Newman, an Academy Award-winning actor and race car driver, was
at times quiet, at times exuberant as he talked about the camp
before private dedication ceremonies.
   ``This (camp) may ultimately be the champ,'' he said of his
achievements. ``I don't know ... it just depends on how it goes.''
   The camp, nestled in the woods of northeastern Connecticut, is
free for children with life-threatening diseases, ages 7 to 17.
Newman said there is still room for more kids.
   Located on about 300 acres, the camp is modeled after a frontier
logging town of the old Wild West.
   It will have horseback riding, boating, a baseball field, tennis
courts, a gymnasium, dining hall and spacious cabins with sitting
rooms and front porches. Golf carts are available for transportation
around the camp.
   Newman grew quiet as he talked about one young boy who was
featured in one of the camp's first promotions.
   ``I visited him in Boston,'' Newman said. ``He didn't make it.
All he wanted to do was toast marshmallows.''
   The camp's name was the one used for a gang of outlaws in the
movie, ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' which starred Newman
and Robert Redford.
   ``I prize irreverance,'' Newman said of his choice for the name.
   Newman said he wanted to give the ill children a sense of
unpressured time through the camp.
   ``You know, time is the major ingredient that gives you the
opportunity to leave a mark,'' he said. ``And that's the least of
what these kids have. They've never been given the gift of time.
It's always living on the edge for them.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Close Down Another Radio Newscast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday announced it
has shut down another radio newscast for broadcasting ``false
information'' in violation of communication laws.
   The Interior Ministry said the privately owned Radio
Corporacion's ``Ten on the Dot'' news program was ordered closed
Friday night for eight days for broadcasting an item from an
international news agency that the ministry claimed was false.
   The newscast reported the leftist Sandinista government
``admitted it had assassinated'' Jorge Salazar, a leader of an
anti-government business group, and Moises Mondragon, a rebel who
had sought government amnesty.
   Salazar, vice president of the Private Enterprise Superior
Coordinating Council, was killed during a gunfight involving police
Nov. 17, 1980, in what authorities at the time claimed was an
attempt to smuggle firearms into Nicaragua.
   Mondragon's body was found near the Honduran border last year and
he had been shot. Officials have not publicly commented on the
circumstances surrounding his death.
   ``Ten on the Dot'' was the only privately run news program on the
air since Wednesday, when the government closed down ``Six on the
Dot,'' another Radio Corporacion newscast, and Catholic Radio's
``Church'' program for 10 days, both also for allegedly broadcasting
false information.
   The ``Six on the Dot'' and ``Church'' items that the government
objected to were reports that Felix Garcia Hernandez, a rebel leader
also known as Commander Alfa-Lima, had not surrendered as the
Sandinistas claimed but had been kidnapped.
   Catholic Radio is operated by by the Roman Catholic Church.

<TEXT>
   Mary Poppins wouldn't recognize today's
chimney sweeps. They carry high-tech breathing masks, power tools
and even video cameras, said an organizer of a weekend convention of
chimney sweeps here.
   Gone are the long-stick brushes and literary images of young boys
with soot-smudged cheeks and long black coats climbing on rooftops,
said Clint Bernard, president of the North Carolina Guild of
Professional Chimney Sweeps.
   The country's estimated 5,500 sweeps are getting serious about
their business, and they want people to know it.
   ``We're trying to get away from the cutesy image,'' Bernard said
at the Charlotte hotel where chimney sweeps from 11 states were
gathered for the guild's ninth annual convention. ``(People) should
be looking for credentials _ not somebody wearing a top hat and
tails and looking like they walked out of a Dickens novel.''
   The top-hat-and-tails image hearkens to 19th century Europe, when
sweeps wore the fancy garb to distinguish themselves as masters of
their craft, Bernard said.
   The four-day convention, which attracted about 180 sweeps from as
far away as Texas and New York, runs through Sunday with seminars,
speeches and a trade show where merchants displayed the latest in
chimney cleaning devices.
   Chimney sweeps avoid the rooftop settings where actor Dick Van
Dyke, playing a sweep, danced in the movie ``Mary Poppins,'' Bernard
said. Instead, they generally clean chimneys through the fireplace,
using brushes attached to polyurethane expandable poles.
   They also wear special fireproof jackets, shirts and hats and don
full-face respiratory masks when needed to avoid inhaling clouds of
soot, he said.
   About half own closed-circuit video cameras, which are extended
on long poles into the flue to peer into corners and detect other
problem spots a sweep cannot see, Bernard said.
   Electric rotor tools with whirling discs and high-powered vacuums
help finish the job, he said.

<HEAD>Atlantic Beach May Lose Town Hall, Other Property In Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC BEACH, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This coastal community may lose its
town hall and other property to foreclosure because it can't afford
to pay off a $140,000 settlement to the daughter of a man killed by
town police four years ago.
   ``I've never heard of a situation like this,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State John Stokes.
   Donnie Riggins, 20, was shot at a restaurant in 1984 by a
part-time town police officer running to catch a suspect smoking a
marijuana cigarette. The death was ruled accidental, but the town
agreed last year to pay Riggins' daughter $140,000 in an
out-of-court settlement. The decision came just moments before a
federal court was to hear a wrongful death lawsuit.
   The town had no liability insurance at the time of the shooting.
   After paying the first three installments totaling $15,000, the
town fell behind on a court-mandated schedule. A $50,000 payment was
due Aug. 2, 1987, but attorneys for Riggins' daughter, Tyanna M.
Vaught, aged 3 at the time of the shooting, said the town has not
paid.
   In January, U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck ordered the town
to put up its property as collateral. That includes the town hall,
community center and fire station.
   Lawyers for Riggins' daughter said they will begin foreclosure on
the property within two weeks. Attorney Fayrell Furr Jr. said Friday
he will seek foreclosure unless the town pays the balance of the
settlement _ $125,000.
   ``It's imminent,'' said attorney John Leiter, who also represents
the little girl. ``The family doesn't want to cause Atlantic Beach
any undue hardship. They're just asking Atlantic Beach to live up
the agreement reached in court.''
   Mayor Joe Montgomery was reluctant to discuss the debt, but he
said he believes Atlantic Beach won't lose any property.
   ``It's highly unprobable we'll lose anything because of the
options we have,'' Montgomery said. He declined to say what the
options were, except that they didn't involve a tax increase.
   A council member who said she did not know of Montgomery's plans,
Sullivan said no other funds have been available since the town was
able to make the $15,000 payment through property tax revenues.
   ``If we had the money, we would have paid,'' Fannie Sullivan said.
   With a per capita income in 1983 of $4,553, Atlantic Beach is one
of the poorest towns in the state.
   Current appraised values weren't available for the community
center or the single-story brick town hall, which also holds the
police department. The community center was estimated in 1986 to be
worth $42,000.

   Nations that fought in the Battle of Normandy will
mark the 44th anniversary of D-Day on Monday by opening a museum
dedicated to world peace.
   Instead of rusty tanks and yellowing propaganda posters, the
mammoth glass-and-stone memorial outside the city of Caen will house
multi-media exhibits that stress the lessons of World War II as much
as the battle itself.
   The museum includes a research center with computerized access to
war archives in France and overseas, a film and photography archive,
and six exhibits that explain the development of the war from its
origins in the post-World War I period.
   French President Francois Mitterrand will inaugurate the memorial
outside the Normandy town on Monday.
   Caen Mayor Jean-Marie Girault said his objective in building the
museum was to stress the fight against fascism, not to glorify
battlefield victories. U.S. Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., a supporter of
the project, concurred in an interview Saturday.
   ``Although we were fighting battles over real estate, the war was
really about ideological matters'' said Gibbons, who parachuted
behind German lines during the invasion and is the only Normandy
veteran still serving in Congress.
   He said the museum would show the ``whys'' of the
``disintegration of the world after World War I.''
   Allied forces landed along an 80-mile front of Normandy coastline
on June 6, 1944. More than 3 million soldiers fought for 76 days,
during which 367,000 men died or were wounded. The Allied triumph
crushed Nazi forces in France and marked a turning point in the war.

<TEXT>
   A Church of England clergyman who publishes
information about the state of religion in communist countries said
Saturday he had been refused a visa to the Soviet Union for the
fifth time.
   The Rev. Michael Bourdeaux said he was barred from taking
pilgrims to the 1,000th anniversary celebrations of the founding of
Christianity in Russia which start Sunday.
   ``It (refusal of visa) makes one call into question whether the
reforms in the Soviet Union are as genuine as they appear to be on
the surface,'' Bourdeaux told Independent Radio News.
   Bourdeaux, 54, who studied at Moscow State University in 1959-60,
founded the Keston College Center for the Study of Religion and
Communism near London in 1969. The center publishes frequent
information on communist persecution of religious believers.
   Bourdeaux was awarded the 1984 Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion, founded by Sir John M. Templeton, a multimillionaire,
U.S.-born investment counselor who lives in Nassau, Bahamas.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the
Anglican state church, flew to Moscow on Saturday with a party of
British churchmen to attend the ceremonies.
   Speaking to reporters at London's Heathrow Airport, Runcie said
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness,
is in part responsible for the extent of the celebrations.
   ``It's something that is deep in the Russian spirit. The whole
history of Russia is impregnated with Christianity,'' he said.
   ``But it would not be taking place on this scale and it would not
be taking place with an element of participation from the general
public and indeed from state officials, if there were not a new
policy,'' he added.

   An 80-year-old woman who was killed in her
apartment may have been victimized by robbers seeking cash she
wouldn't put in banks, but her assailants didn't find $99,000 left
at the scene, authorities say.
   Julia Menoni's body was found May 25 in her suburban Highwood
apartment, next to a boarding house she owned, police said Friday.
   The widow had been stabbed in the chest and abdomen, her throat
had been slashed and she had suffered severe trauma to the head,
said Highwood Police Chief Forrest Grandi.
   ``She was known to keep money around,'' Grandi said, adding that
she may have been killed because she refused to reveal where the
cash was hidden or because she recognized her assailants.
   Police found the $99,000 in $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills in the
apartment.
   ``There were several purses hanging on a bedroom door knob, with
clothing hung over the door,'' the chief said. ``We found some
$20,000 in those purses.
   ``In the living room, we found $46,000 in a tea cannister. We
found more cash under the kitchen sink in coffee and tea
cannisters.''
   ``She was a trusting little old lady,'' said Lake County Coroner
Barbara Richardson. ``Police tried several times to get her to put
her money in banks.''
   Grandi said evidence indicates two men were the killers.
   Grandi said it was doubtful the killers got much money.
   ``Maybe they got a couple hundred dollars _ some money that was
under a tablecloth,'' he said.

   A subway clerk died Saturday night after she was
severely burned in a failed attempt to rob her token booth,
authorities said.
   The 39-year-old mother of three, Mona Pierre, was burned over 80
percent of her body Friday by an assailant who became angered
because she refused to open her locked, bullet-proof booth.
   He poured a flammable liquid through the small opening in the
booth through which the attendant and the customer exchange money
and tokens, said transit police spokesman Al O'Leary.
   The subsequent fiery blast scorched the token booth and the
suspect fled empty-handed, O'Leary said.
   Ms. Pierre, on the job less than a year, ran from the booth, her
clothes afire. A passenger who had left the station returned when he
heard the explosion and used his sweat shirt to put out the flames
burning Ms. Pierre, O'Leary said.

<TEXT>
   At least eight members of an informal group
distributing ``Meese is a Pig'' posters have been ticketed or
arrested in the past month for posting the signs critical of the
attorney general, an organizer of the project said Saturday.
   The signs aimed at Edwin Meese III read ``Experts Agree! Meese is
a Pig,'' and have appeared around the Washington area on traffic
signal boxes, fences, buildings and in public transportation areas.
   Organizer Mark Andersen, 28, of Arlington, Va., said about 60
people, many of them punk rock musicians and their friends, are
involved in the project.
   He said the informal group objects to Meese's law enforcement and
civil rights policies and believes his conduct in the Iran-Contra
investigation and his dealings with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.
are grounds for ouster.
   He said the group is voicing its opposition to Meese ``with
creativity and with humor.''
   Four people were arrested in Arlington for posting signs on
county property, and four others have been ticketed in the District
of Columbia in the past month for their role in posting the
anti-Meese signs, police officials confirmed.
   Andersen said Secret Service officers followed him and pulled him
over for driving a car with faulty brake lights in mid-May after he
picked up some poster supplies left in a parking lot.
   Secret Service spokesman Richard Adams said the department's
officers have the same rights as District of Columbia police to stop
traffic violators, but he had no information on Andersen's case.
   Andersen said he subsequently was contacted about the posters by
the FBI, and has asked the bureau to submit its questions to him in
writing.
   ``I can't understand it at all other than that they're trying to
intimidate me,'' he said.
   FBI spokesman Harry Mount had no comment.
   Both the posters and T-shirts bearing the same slogan are part of
a local grass-roots effort to bring about Meese's resignation,
Andersen said.
   Common Concerns, a Washington bookstore, has sold about 150 of
the T-shirts in the past two months, said bookstore employee Linda
Ellis.

<TEXT>
   Rubberworkers in Des Moines approved a
proposed contract with Firestone Inc. on Saturday, putting it close
to ratification in the final weekend of voting on a pact that
affects about 4,700 workers in six states.
   One union official said that after years of concessions, ``we're
getting something back.''
   The tentative agreement ended a week-long strike against
Firestone that began May 15, and it was in line with a master
contract negotiated by the United Rubber Workers union and the
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. on May 17.
   Votes were scheduled Sunday by URW members at Firestone plants at
Akron, Ohio, and Noblesville, Ind., and approval by either one would
result in ratification of the three-year pact, said Curt Brown, a
spokesman at URW headquarters at Akron.
   Ron Smiley, president of Local 310 at Des Moines, said Saturday's
approval already gave the contract support of a majority of the URW
members working for Firestone. But union rules also require approval
by a majority of the locals.
   Earlier, the pact was approved by locals at Decatur, Ill., and
Russellville, Ark., but it was turned down at Oklahoma City.
   In Des Moines, the proposal was approved by a 398-258 vote at a
plant with more than 1,400 workers, Smiley said.
   Smiley said there was some dissension in Iowa because even with
raises, some workers would not catch up with past concessions.
   However, he said: ``I'm glad it's over. It's not a bad package.''
   The Iowa workers had made wage and benefit concessions to keep
their factory open in 1982, 1985 and 1987.
   ``Now we've reversed that trend and we're getting a little
something back,'' Smiley said.
   He said that with employment climbing at Des Moines, Japan's
Bridgestone Corp. taking over Firestone and a new contract
apparently approved, ``we're in good shape.''
   An average Firestone worker at the six plants earns $12.50 an
hour, according to the union. The proposed contract with Firestone
would provide a 25-cent-an-hour increase, but it would be considered
an advance that would be deducted from future cost-of-living raises
in increments of no more than 10 cents a year.

<HEAD>Bank Robbers Drive Off With Hostages And Loot But Return, Low On
Gas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two robbers in a southern Brazilian
bank on Saturday left with their hostages, the money and a getaway
car provided by authorities but returned when they ran low on gas,
police said.
   The gunmen, holed up in the bank since their foiled robbery
attempt Thursday, released 11 of their 12 remaining hostages during
their brief flight before returning to the bank, said Guaraci Abreu,
police chief of Goiere.
   They were inside the bank's safe, holding the bank manager as
their last hostage, and demanded an armored truck to attempt another
escape, possibly overnight, Abreu said.
   After a 35-hour police siege the authorities in Goiere, a small
rural town in Parana state located 550 miles southwest of Rio de
Janeiro, agreed to give the bandits the equivalent of $100,000 in
cash and a car in exchange for eight of the remaining twelve
hostages.
   The robbers originally took two guards and 24 other employees
hostage, but by Saturday morning all but 12 either were gradually
released during negotiations with the police or escaped.
   Abreu the thieves released eight hostages one by one early
Saturday morning and after receiving the money they took off in the
car with the other four.
   Three hostages were freed passing the town's limits but the
manager was kept as driver, Abreu said in a telephone interview.
   ``One hour later the two bandits and their hostage were back at
the bank complaining that the car had not fuel enough to go
further,'' he said.
   About sixty state troopers who were about to start chasing the
fugitives surrounded the bank again.
   Antonio Lopes Noronha, state justice secretary, told reporters:
``I guess we now just have to wait. The time is on our side and they
do not have steel nerves.''

   A 33-year-old trader who made between $80 million
and $100 million in 1987 topped a published list of Wall Street's
biggest earners in the year of the stock market crash.
   Paul Tudor Jones II earned his millions by trading $75 billion
worth of financial and commodity futures, according to Financial
World, which published ``The Wall Street 100'' in its June 28 issue.
   Jones, founder and president of Tudor Investment Corp., ``guessed
right in the futures pits,'' the magazine said.
   George Soros of Soros Fund Management was ranked second on the
list, with income of at least $75 million, the magazine said.
   Henry Kravis and George Roberts of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
each made more than $70 million while Michael Milken of Drexel
Burnham Lambert brought in at least $60 million, Financial World
reported.
   Michel David-Weill of Lazard Freres made $54 million and Jerome
Kohlberg of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts brought home at least $35
million, it said.
   The top 10 was rounded out by John Winberg of Goldman Sachs with
at least $32 million, Donald Carter of the Carter Organization with
between $30 million and $32 million and Theodore Forstmann of
Forstmann Little with at least $30 million.
   Because 48 Goldman, Sachs partners qualified for the Wall Street
100, the magazine put them on a separate list and included only
Chairman John Weinberg on the top 100 list.
   The magazine said the top 100 grossed about $2 billion or an
average of about $12 million per person, not including the Goldman,
Sachs partners.
   The magazine said Neuberger & Berman would have had four or five
of its people on the list but big losses during the October stock
market crash cost the company about one-third of its capital.
   It also said 1987 bonuses were slashed an average of 25 percent
to 50 percent, Shearson Lehman Hutton levied cutbacks of between 25
percent and 50 percent in some areas and about 80 percent of Smith
Barney's managing directors took pay cuts.

<TEXT>
   A Sunday newspaper reported the 18 foreign hostages
kidnapped in Lebanon are being held in a former school in south
Beirut and it carried a front-page photograph of a building it said
was the school.
   The Mail on Sunday said the hostages, including nine Americans
and three Britons, were taken there during recent fighting in the
area between gunmen of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah organization and
Shiite Amal militiamen.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed holding the captives.
   The Mail on Sunday attributed its report to Amal officers it did
not identify.
   In other developments:
   _ London's Guardian newspaper said the United States is holding
talks with Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon and directly with Iranian
representatives in Geneva in another effort to gain the release of
the hostages. It based its report on information from unidentified
political sources in Beirut.
   _ The British Foreign Office said Saturday it has proposed paying
Iran the equivalent of more than $3.2 million as compensation in a
settlement over damages to British diplomatic buildings in Iran and
Iran's Embassy in London.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, who was not identified in line with
government practice, said the proposal is to be discussed at a
meeting in London starting Wednesday but the talks will not cover
the question of the British hostages in Lebanon.
   Of the nine American captives, Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held the longest.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Many previous published reports on where the hostages were being
held and about talks to gain their release turned out to be
unfounded.
   The Mail on Sunday said the captives are being guarded at the
school by high ranking Hezbollah officers supervised by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards.
   It said Amal militiamen have infiltrated Hezbollah and quoted one
Amal fighter as describing the school where it said the hostages are
held.
   The newspaper said militiaman Abu Abass was interrogated by
Hezbollah members at the building, the former Azariyeh primary
school.
   Reporters in Beirut said they knew of an Azariyeh primary school
located in the southern suburbs of Beirut but they did not how it is
being used.
   The newspaper quoted Abass as saying, ``The tunnels and
passageways have recently been excavated and a ventilation system
has been installed. The whole area has been partitioned into tiny
cells.''
   Abass also said a doctor occasionally goes to the school,
accompanied by guards.
   The Mail on Sunday quoted other Amal officers as saying: ``We
know they (the hostages) are there and that they are alive. But any
attempt to take them by force will only result in bloodshed.''
   The dim front-page photo showed what appeared to be part of a
one-story building with sandbags at strategic points.
   In its article, the Guardian said the purported talks in Lebanon
and Geneva were not expected to produce quick results for the
American hostages, but to ``accelerate'' as the American
presidential elections approach in November.
   It said the United States is thought to be seeking a ``package
deal'' that also would involve Church of England envoy Terry Waite
who was in Lebanon trying to arrange the release of the foreign
hostages when he disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987.
   The Foreign Office spokesman said the British proposal on
settlement of damages to diplomatic buildings was first made in May
1987. Britain has said repeatedly that it will make no deals to gain
the release of the hostages.
   The spokesman said the Iranian representatives at Wednesday's
meeting will only be considering the questions of damage to Iran's
Embassy at London's Princes Gate, which caught fire when British
commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a hostage siege, and damage to
British diplomatic offices in Tehran and elsewhere in Iran.
   British government buildings and the British Embassy were damaged
by mobs in 1978, 1979, and 1980.
   ``We want compensation for the damage to our property in Iran and
we want to ensure that the necessary repairs are done to the Princes
Gate property, which is a health hazard and an eyesore,'' the
spokesman said.
   He said under the proposal, Britain would pay Iran about 1.8
million pounds ($3.24 million) and Iran would pay Britain about
about 900,000 pounds ($1.62 million).
   A series of diplomatic explusions has left just one British
official in Tehran and one Iranian official in London.

<HEAD>Dredge Sinks In Channel, Oil Slick Threatens Beaches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dredge vessel sank in a river
channel Saturday and was leaking thousands of gallons of oil that
spread over more than a mile, threatening beaches and sensitive
marshlands, officials said.
   The 168-foot vessel was dredging the St. Mary's River channel,
which straddles the Georgia-Florida line, when waves crashed over
its bow causing it to flood and sink, said Capt. Robert O'Pezio of
the U.S. Coast Guard, the on-scene coordinator.
   ``The people on board ended up in the water,'' said Dave Kelly, a
Coast Guard damage control officer. ``They didn't have time to get
off.''
   Seven crew members from the dredge were plucked from the water as
it sank near the entrance to the 50-foot deep channel, he said. The
ship held 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel and was leaking about 500
gallons an hour.
   John Spendlove, a crewmember aboard a Navy tug, was injured in
the rescue effort and was in satisfactory condition at University
Hospital in Jacksonville, said Judi Skelton, a hospital spokeswoman.
   From a helicopter, an oil slick could be seen drifting into the
Atlantic Ocean and pushing southward about a mile from Fernandina
Beach, O'Pezio said. The slick extended at least a mile from the
dredge and was at least a mile wide.
   Choppy seas were breaking the fuel into streaks, which drifted
two to three miles west into the St. Marys River in the direction of
the sensitive Cumberland Sound and Amelia River wetland areas. No
fuel appears to have entered those areas yet, O'Pezio said.
   To prevent the fuel from spreading further, the owner of the
dredge hired an oil containment contractor to erect floating
containment booms at the entrances of creeks and tributaries
extending from the channel.
   Ships will be unable to get into or out of the Port of Fernandina
or Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base until the debris of the sunken
dredge is pinpointed, said O'Pezio, who declined to speculate how
long that might take.

   Crews with siphon hoses worked along a
creek Saturday to clean up some 128,000 gallons of oil that
officials said caused no serious environmental damage.
   Bob Wimmer, assistant fire chief in the Milwaukee suburb of
Wauwatosa, said the heating oil poured from a two-foot hole in an
underground pipe for 18 minutes before pumps were shut down. The
leak was discovered early Saturday.
   The leak's cause was unclear, Wimmer said.
   Residents who reported an oil odor were told it carried no health
hazard. Dean Kelley, spill coordinator for the state Department of
Natural Resources, said the fumes were the same as those when fuel
is being fed to a dwelling's furnace tank.
   Oil traveled about five miles through Underwood Creek into the
Menomonee River, a tributary of Lake Michigan. Authorities said no
oil reached the lake harbor.
   Underwood Creek is lined with concrete, which should prevent
contamination to drinking water, ground water or private wells and
would protect wildlife from serious damage, said Doug Hoskins, a
conservation warden with the state Department of Natural Resources.
   The spill was ``one of the bigger ones we've had in the area for
some time, if not the biggest,'' Hoskins said.
   Fish in Underwood Creek primarily are small minnows and chubs,
Hoskins said. He said he had heard waterfowl were nesting along the
banks but he found no injured or dead birds.
   ``I think we got off lucky,'' Hoskins said.
   Kelley said temporary dams 100 feet upstream and 100 feet
downstream from the spill site on Underwood Creek would contain the
bulk of the oil and simplify the use of siphon hoses to pump the
fluid into storage tanks.

   Workers intensified the search
Saturday for survivors of a powerful mine blast after rescuing six
men who survived 65 hours in an underground air pocket.
   The rescue came with the help of a television crew's microphone
that picked up tapping sounds when it was lowered into a mineshaft.
   A West German television station early Sunday quoted one of the
six survivors as saying rescuers unknowingly made radio contact with
them hours after the explosion on Wednesday.
   The rescuers apparently thought the six were with the teams
searching for 57 people missing after the blast, the television said.
   All 57 had been given up for dead. Late Saturday, a 37th body was
recovered. Fourteen other miners were still missing.
   Officials said the miners were trapped about 500 feet underground
in an air pocket away from carbon monoxide estimated at 50 times the
level fatal to humans.
   ``It's a miracle,'' said Peter-Carl Ruehland, a spokesman for
Preussen Elektra, the company that owns the coal mine.
   Heinz Cramer, a spokesman for the mine owner, said the men were
in an area ``which was about to run out of oxygen, and time was
running out when they were found.''
   Another survivor, mine supervisor Thomas Gepperth, said:
``Everybody was making their last wills and testaments. I told them
they didn't have to.''
   Gepperth saved the men by leading them away from the carbon
monoxide gas, the supervisor told Hesse state television.
   ZDF television said a Turkish survivor, Ahmet Batkan, told the
network the radio contact occurred hours after the blast Wednesday.
   ``The buried miners had given their position on a radio,'' the
television reported Batkan as saying. ``They were then told not to
use the radio again, in order not to disturb other signals.''
   ``At first they stopped (using the radio), and when they tried
again they were not able to make contact,'' the television said.
   Officials could not be immediately reached to comment on the
television report.
   But on the day of the accident, Borken Mayor Bernd Hessler told
reporters of radio contact with a group of miners who reported
themselves uninjured, but other officials said later in the day that
the contact was made with other rescuers.
   Another survivor, also interviewed on state television but not
identified by name, described hearing drilling on Friday, followed
by silence.
   ``That was really agonizing, because nothing more was going on up
there. You start thinking, `Have they forgotten us or something?
Maybe they're figuring it's not worth it,''' he said.
   Searchers, some with tears in their eyes, broke into applause as
the exhausted but otherwise unhurt survivors reached the surface.
   The dramatic rescue sparked hopes for finding more survivors
inside the Stolzenbach mine.
   ``It's a faint hope, but a supervisor said there were tracks of
two people who may also be in an area where they may have
survived,'' said Cramer, a board member of Preussen Elektra. ``We're
stepping up the search.''
   ``You can certainly call Gepperth's actions something special. He
reacted in exactly the right way,'' Cramer added.
   He said about 200 workers were involved in the search in Borken,
a town of 15,000 people 70 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   Family members who rushed to the scene embraced the five West
Germans and one Turk. Fourteen Turkish immigrant workers were among
the 57 trapped miners.
   The six survivors later paused for photographers but told
reporters not to ask them any questions.
   They were examined at nearby hospitals, then allowed to go home.
   Cramer told reporters the six were found in a dead-end tunnel
about 10 feet wide and eight feet high.
   The rescue came after crews drilled an air shaft in the east
field of the mine. Officials said that carbon monoxide levels
registered lower there than in the north field, where they were 50
times higher than the amount lethal for humans.
   Rescuers had believed that all 13 miles of underground shafts
were filled with such high levels of carbon monoxide that no one
could be found alive.
   But Friday night, rescuers detected tapping sounds through the
air shaft and tried to verify them with a stethoscope. A television
cameraman suggested lowering a microphone, which picked up the
trapped men saying, ``They have drilled a hole.''
   Early Saturday the microphone detected regular tapping sounds.
   After more than three hours of digging, the rescue workers broke
into the air pocket and found the men.
   Some victims' relatives criticized the rescue efforts, saying
they believed the retrieval of bodies had been given priority over
the search for survivors. They also said they could not understand
why workers didn't think to use a microphone earlier.
   Company and state officials staunchly defended the rescue
operation.
   When the group felt the shock wave of the blast Wednesday, Cramer
said, they ran toward an exit. But Gepperth, 36, a veteran miner and
trained rescuer, realized they were running into high concentrations
of deadly carbon monoxide when he saw another man staggerering.
   Gepperth turned the group in the other direction and instructed
them to be as calm as possible to conserve oxygen, Cramer said.
   Many of the confirmed fatalities died of carbon monoxide
poisoning.
   In addition to Gepperth and Batkan, company officials identified
the survivors as Egon Dehn, Helmut Gesner, Heinz Roese and Wilfried
Doench. They range in age from 21 to 36.
   A man who identified himself as Dehn's brother-in-law, said the
six men had kept up their hopes by talking about the ``Miracle of
Lengede.''
   That was a reference to a 1963 mining disaster in the Lower
Saxony iron ore mine of Lengede, when 11 miners were found alive two
weeks after water flooded the mine. Twenty-nine miners died in that
accident.
   The Borken explosion is the worst West German mining accident
since 299 men died in 1962 at the Luisenthal mine in Saarland state
along the border with France.

   Korczak Ziolkowski died before he
completed carving a Black Hills mountain into a likeness of Sioux
Indian leader Crazy Horse, but Ziolkowski's widow, Ruth, helped to
continue his work as she oversaw Saturday's ceremony marking the
40th anniversary of the project's start.
   Three explosions removed rock from Thunderhead Mountain in
western South Dakota as part of the ceremony, though the first
charge detonated earlier than planned.
   The final two blasts were set off as scheduled by Mrs. Ziolkowski
and Gov. George Mickelson.
   The unexpected early blast ripped rock from the mountain as
Mickelson began to deliver a speech to a crowd of several hundred
people who gathered for the event. ``The power of a voice,'' he
joked after the explosion.
   Mrs. Ziolkowski said the first blast was set off prematurely by
static electricity. No one was injured by the detonation.
   Ziolkowski died in 1982 at age 74, but his wife and eight of
their 10 children have continued working to shape the mountain.
   Crazy Horse helped lead the Indians who defeated Gen. George
Custer at the 1876 battle of the Little Big Horn. But after he and
1,000 starving followers were forced to surrender, he was killed by
a soldier's bayonet in 1877.
   When completed, a statue 563 feet tall and 641 feet long will
show Crazy Horse astride a horse and pointing east to the Plains.
Ziolkowski said it will depict Crazy Horse's answer to a white man
who asked what had become of his lands. Crazy Horse pointed over his
horse's head and replied, ``My lands are where my dead lie buried.''
   Some Sioux leaders asked Ziolkowski to create the monument. ``My
fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man had
great heroes, too,'' Chief Henry Standing Bear wrote in a letter
asking Ziolkowski to carve the monument.
   The explosions Saturday removed rock at what will become the
Indian's elbow, his pointing finger and the horse's mane.
   Private donations and entrance fees are financing the Crazy Horse
project. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation, which purchased the
mountain from the federal government, collects the money to keep the
project going.
   The mountain is beginning to take on the rough form of
Ziolkowski's vision as about 8.2 million tons of rock have been
removed. Mrs. Ziolkowski said she and her family will work in the
coming decades to complete the carving.

<TEXT>
   Thirty-six undocumented Mexican aliens were
found Saturday wandering without food or water in the searing Sonora
desert north of Tucson after two of them came to a ranch seeking
help, authorities said.
   The 35 men and one woman, whom officials said had been walking
four days since crossing the border onto the Tohono O'odham Indian
Reservation, were brought to Northwest Hospital by Border Patrol bus.
   The 36 were in generally good condition, said nursing supervisor
Cheryl Lanier. Three men were treated for dehydration, and the rest
were simply given drinks and a chance to cool off in the hospital's
cafeteria, said emergency room services director Ardis Waite.
   After treatment, all 36 were returned to the custody of the
Border Patrol, Ms. Lanier said.
   Those in good physical condition who wanted to return to Mexico
would be allowed to do so voluntarily, said Border Patrol
Supervisory Agent Clyde J. Benzenhoefer.
   The Mexicans, ranging in age from 18 to about 50, all came from
the state of Oaxaca and crossed probably from the town of San
Miguel, Sonora, south of Sells, Ariz., Benzenhoefer said.
   He said they had told officials they were en route to look for
farm work, probably near Phoenix, had been traveling mostly at night
and had run out of water Friday afternoon or Saturday morning.
   Benzenhoefer said the group was found about 3 p.m. He said the
group had located runoff water near the Silverbell branch mine
operated by the Asarco Co., about 60 miles north of the Mexican
border and about 20 miles northwest of Tucson, where the temperature
reached 108 degrees Saturday.
   ``They had just found it when we got to 'em. Apparently they
would have kept on going if we hadn't found them,'' he said.
   ``They were probably in pretty bad shape. I would imagine it was
110 degrees out in the desert today,'' Benzenhoefer said.
   He said all but three men had crossed in one group. He said the
three came across the rest on Saturday.
   Both groups were out of water, and two of the three went to a
rancher about four or five miles from the mine, and asked for help.
The rancher notified the Pima County sheriff's authorities, who in
turn called the Border Patrol, Benzenhoefer said.
   He said none of the Mexicans had acknowledged having a coyote, or
paid guide who smuggles undocumented aliens across the border.
   ``None of them have identified him yet if they did. I'm sure they
did have somebody that guided them across,'' Benzenhoefer said, and
added that it was possible one of the group could be a coyote. He
also said a coyote ``might have cut off from the group'' upon seeing
the Border Patrol approaching.''
   He said the route was a common one for illegal border crossings.
   Last summer, U.S. Border Patrol agents said about 70 bodies since
1980 had been found in the Sonora desert area.

<HEAD>Study Finds Miscarriages More Common Among Some VDT Users</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of nearly 1,600 pregnant women found that
those who used video display terminals for more than 20 hours each
week in the first three months of pregnancy suffered almost twice as
many miscarriages as women who did not, according to a published
report.
   The findings did not necessarily mean that the terminals
themselves had caused the miscarriages, said the authors of the
study, researchers at the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program in
Oakland, Calif.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that such
unmeasured factors as job-related stress and poor working conditions
could also have been responsible.
   The results of the study appear in the June issue of The American
Journal of Industrial Medicine. The researchers called for more
elaborate studies.
   The researchers found that heavy users of VDTs were more likely
to have children with birth defects but the increase was not
statistically significant, the researchers said.
   The findings were the first epidemiological evidence based on
substantial numbers of pregnant VDT operators to show a
statistically significant increase of miscarriages among those who
use the terminals more than 20 hours a week, the Times said.
   Some experts have suggested that low-level electromagnetic
radiation from VDTs may be able to alter or disrupt cellular
development.
   About 15 million VDTs are in use in the United States and about 3
million more are added annually, according to the VDT News, an
industry newsletter. About half the estimated 10 million people who
use the machines on the job are women of child-bearing age, the
Times said.
   The researchers surveyed 1,583 pregnant women in northern
California.
   The study found increased risks of miscarriage in both the first
and second trimesters of pregnancy for all women who worked with
video display terminals for more than 20 hours a week. No
statistically significant increase was found for women who had used
the terminals less than 20 hours a week, the researchers said.
   Preliminary results of a University of Michigan study of 728
state employees in Michigan released last September found that
pregnant women working at VDTs less than 20 hours a week faced no
increased risk of miscarriage.

   A distraught woman killed two of her children
by setting fire to their bedroom and later died herself from the
blaze Saturday afternoon, fire officials said.
   Newark Fire Director Stanley Kossup said Michelle Noble, 26,
tried but failed to trap her two other children in the 2{-story wood
frame house.
   Neighbors told investigators the woman had a history of mental
problems and engaged in frequent arguments with her children.
   ``Somehow she became distraught and made the decision to do what
she did,'' Kossup said.
   One of the children who escaped, 8-year-old Lamarr, told
investigators that his mother set fire to a first-floor bedroom in
the house and restrained her daughters, Lakia Santrice, 5, and
Comfort Nichole, 4.
   The boy told officials that his mother tried to trap him and his
2-year-old sister, Latiffa, in the room, but they escaped.
   After flames engulfed the room, the mother fled outside for a
brief period and then returned to the house's kitchen, the boy said.
   From the boy's account, investigators believe the fire was
started ``with the intent to kill the children,'' Kossup said. The
boy said his mother lay over the two girls to trap them in the room,
according to Kossup.
   Ms. Noble asked her son to give her some materials to help build
a fire, but he gave her some wet papers and ``had the presence of
mind to get his baby sister out of there,'' Kossup said.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials project that at least 450,000
Americans will have been diagnosed with AIDS by the end of 1993,
according to published reports.
   The estimate, reported in Sunday editions of The Washington Post
and The New York Times, represents the first major revision in two
years of the nation's projected AIDS caseload.
   It also is the first to extend the original Public Health Service
figures beyond the 270,000 people expected to have developed the
disease by 1991.
   The current cumulative total of AIDS victims is 63,726.
   The new projections were presented last week to more than 150
senior health service officials who gathered at a private meeting in
Charlottesville, Va., to plan a federal response to the AIDS
epidemic, the newspapers reported.
   The boldest proposal at the conference, according to several key
participants interviewed by the Times, was a call by the drug abuse
working group for a large increase in the quantity and quality of
treatment programs for intravenous drug users.
   According to drug abuse professionals who heard the panel's
summation, the Times said, experts from the National Institute on
Drug Abuse recommended that the number of slots in drug abuse
treatment programs be boosted from the current level of 148,000 up
to 380,000 to serve roughly a third of all the nation's drug abusers.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   As of June 2, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 63,726 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 35,798, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to
have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>Government Acknowledges No Proof of U.S. Funding for Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Saturday its investigations
have not produced evidence that an opposition politician received
funds from the U.S. government.
   Former Solicitor General Francis Seow was arrested on May 6 under
the Internal Security Act and accused of subversive activities. The
government subsequently claimed he had received money from U.S.
sources to oppose Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's People's Action
Party that has governed Singpaore since 1959.
   Singapore expelled a U.S. diplomat in the dispute.
   A statememt issued by the Home Affairs Ministry said the
investigation showed Seow had received the equivalent of $425,000
from foreigners, but it was unable to identify the contributors.
   It said the Internal Security Department had not been able to
interview people outside Singapore about Seow's finances and added:
   ``This is insufficient to determine whether Seow has received
money from any foreign powers or their agents. The results therefore
remain inconclusive.''
   Last month, the government claimed that E. Mason Hendrickson, a
first secretary at the U.S. Embassy, had tried to persuade Seou and
several other prominent lawyers to run against candidates of the
People's Action Party in general elections in the early 1990s.
   The government expelled Hendrickson. Washington denied the
allegations and in turn expelled Robert Chua, first secretary of
Singapore's Embassy in Washington.
   Under the constitution, parliamentary elections must be held
within five years, and the mandate for the People's Action Party
will expire in December 1989.

   A 27-year-old Maryland man was killed
when a 36-pound boulder was dropped from a parkway overpass and
crashed through the windshield of his car, police said Saturday.
   Takoma Park Police and the Maryland National Capital Park police
were searching for a young man who reportedly was seen standing on
the bridge overlooking the parkway shortly before the boulder was
dropped on Friday night.
   Police also were searching for several witnesses who saw the
accident and might be able to identify the young man.
   Police identified the dead man as German Rodriguez, who lived in
Takoma Park not far from the scene of the accident. Rodriguez was
taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead.
   Police said a passenger in the car, Helen Lopez, was not
seriously injured.

   Lottery players streamed to ticket outlets
across California Saturday, hoping to pick the winning numbers in a
national record jackpot estimated at $51.2 million.
   By the time the drawing took place Saturday night, the odds of
winning were about one in 14 million, said state lottery officials.
As usual, lottery computers will not determine whether anyone has
won the jackpot until Sunday. A winner would not be verified until
Monday.
   Ticket sales on Saturday alone reached more than $33 million, a
one-day all time high, lottery spokesman Bob Taylor said.
   ``At 4 p.m., our ticket sales pushed the lotto prize past $46
million,'' he said, ``past the Pennsylvania record.''
   The nation's previous richest lottery prize, $46 million, was
awarded in Pennsylvania in October. The biggest previous California
jackpot, $25.4 million, was split by two players in October.
   ``There's no way we could have predicted anything like this,''
Taylor said in releasing the anticipated sum and a statement from
Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez calling sales a ``phenomenal tidal
wave.''
   Many stores brought in extra help to keep up with ticket sales.
   ``I cannot handle it. Too many people,'' said Paul Lee, owner of
the New Lun Wah grocery store in San Francisco's Chinatown, where 50
people lined up for tickets Saturday morning.
   ``It's been crazy,'' said Alex Lichine, manager of Lichine's
Liquor, Deli and Catering store in Sacramento. ``It's going to get
worse. Everybody's playing today. Everybody's playing four or five
times more than normal.''
   Ticket buyers forked over dollars at the rate of $2 million per
hour statewide, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   A player beating the 1-in-14 million odds of winning the jackpot,
which began growing when there were no winners in several previous
drawings of the Lotto 6-49 game, would receive the money, after
federal taxes, in an annuity paid over 20 years.
   The actual size of the jackpot depended on how many tickets were
sold.
   The winning numbers, six of 49, were picked in a 7:56 p.m.
drawing in Sacramento. They were: 48, 42, 9, 14, 19, 31. The bonus
number was 37.
   ``I tell you the sky's the limit today. We had almost $5 million
(in ticket sales) at 10 o'clock today,'' said Taylor. ``Last
Saturday at this time we had $904,000. These figures are just mind
boggling.''
   As the game heated up, a Los Angeles psychologist cautioned
players not to fall victim to what he called ``lottery fantasy
syndrome.''
   ``People purchase a ticket, ignore the odds and start thinking of
the impossible: quitting their jobs, buying items that they have
always wanted, going places that they have never been, and some even
think of divorcing their spouses and starting their lives completely
over,'' said Robert Butterworth.
   The jackpot lured players across state and national borders.
   Leo Gronich, owner of Garlan's Inc., a Calexico department store
with a currency exchange, said some players were Mexicans trading
pesos for tickets. Oregon residents drove south to Yreka, Calif.,
for tickets, said clerk Dan Jerden at Sports and Spirits.
   At Tahoe Tom's in South Lake Tahoe, the fat pot drew Nevada
residents across the border, three blocks away.
   ``We were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the
(ticket) line up to the state line and have the casino executives
wonder what's going on,'' said owner Tom Erickson.
   What to do with the enormous sum?
   ``Party forever,'' said Leslie Beagle, 43, of Riverside, as she
plunked down $10 for her shot at the jackpot.
   ``You'd probably have to take six months off to think about it,''
said Bill Masterson, 46, of South Lake Tahoe, who planned to buy
five tickets.

<HEAD>Report: Castro Vows to Free Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro has said he is ready to free nearly
all the political prisoners in Cuban jails, according to a published
report.
   The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that Castro sent
a letter to Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of the New York
diocese of the Roman Catholic church, saying he would free 385 of
the 429 political prisoners in his jails.
   Archdiocese officials would not discuss the list of prisoners,
the Times said, but State Department officials said Saturday the
list had been passed on to them.
   The group of 385 would be one of the largest freed by Castro in
recent years and U.S. officials say it would be a significant step
in improving human rights in Cuba, the Times reported.
   The 44 who would not be released have been in prison since
shortly after Castro took power in 1959 and have resisted political
indoctrination, the Times said. Castro said the 44 were convicted of
``grave and dangerous violations.''
   It is likely to be several weeks before any of the others are
released, the Times said, because Castro said he won't let them go
until the United States agrees to accept them as refugees. Congress
requires that records be studied and prisoners interviewed to make
sure each prisoner is a victim of political persecution and not a
common criminal.

<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old street preacher returned to
school Friday after a 10-day suspension only to be suspended again
when he struck a policeman and resumed shouting Bible verses,
officials said.
   McDowell County Sheriff Bob Haynes said Matthew Strode hit Lt.
John Lite in the face during the incident at Eastfield Elementary
School.
   Matthew returned for the last day of class and began preaching
just inside the school's exit gate Friday morning, according to
reports from the sheriff's department and the school.
   Principal Jim Gorst asked the kindergartener to come into the
building, but he refused. Gorst then told the boy he was suspended
and asked Matthew to come with him. The boy continued to preach and
spun away from Gorst when the principal tried to escort him into
the building.
   Meantime, about 300 McDowell County residents went on the Sally
Jessy Raphael TV talk show Friday to vent their frustration with
Matthew and the rest of his family.
   Matthew and his brother, Duffey, 10, have been suspended from
the school five times each. Their 6-year-old sister, Pepper, has
been suspended four times over incidences involving preaching and
refusing to enter the school building when requested by school
officials.
   When the children's father, David Strode, took Duffey back to
school after a suspension May 27, there were two altercations with
protesting parents. The parents gave him a petition with 474
signatures calling for him to stop his children from preaching.
   During the taping of the show at the Marion Community Building,
David Strode drew the biggest response from the audience when he
attacked women.
   ``When God has a message to deliver, he sends a man,'' he said.
``When the devil wants to say something, he sends a Jezebel.''
   The show taped Friday is scheduled to be aired Tuesday.

   A federal judge on Friday cleared the way for
government testing of a high-powered electrical generator designed
to simulate one of the effects of a nuclear explosion, the Navy
said.
   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Janet Mescus said U.S. District Judge John
Garrett Penn on Friday refused to extend a temporary restraining
order he had issued on Tuesday, a day before testing originally had
been set to begin.
   Following Penn's decision Friday not to extend the restraining
order, Mescus said testing from the Navy's Empress II barge would
begin Monday. The tests are planned for international waters about
15 miles off the Virginia-North Carolina coast.
   Although the Pentagon had scaled down electro-magnetic pulse, or
EMP, research facilities and conducted an environmental assessment
to settle a suit brought by the Foundation on Economic Trends, the
environmental group argued in court that a second study was
necessary.
   The Empress barge is equipped with two diesel generators and a
huge antenna system, capable of sending ``pulses'' of electrical
power into the atmosphere at power levels up to 7 million volts to
test the EMP phenomenon.
   Each pulse lasts only a billionth of a second, and the Navy
maintains the testing will have no effect on human or marine life.
   Electro-magnetic pulse is a powerful wave, or surge, of
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water.

   In a clear defeat for Soviet Communist Party

   The delegate battle has been the talk of Moscow for days as the
state-run media and even political street protests, highly unusual

   The national party conference, scheduled to open June 28, will

   Lower-level party organizations in the capital had not submitted
the names of the reform advocates as candidates for the 19th Party
Conference.
   However, Tass reported the Moscow party bureau sidestepped those

   The Soviet Union made ``significant
improvements'' in human rights in the past half year, though the
well-publicized drive for freedom faltered on some fronts, the State
Department said Saturday in a major report to Congress.
   The department criticized what it called a crackdown on
demonstrations, complained that rights activists' telephones were
disconnected and said the government-controlled press wrote
distorted accounts of the protests.
   Rights performance in Poland, East Germany, Romania and other
East bloc countries was also a mixed bag of old-style repression and
new progress, according to the 137-page document.

   Even before Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon
Duarte learned he was suffering from cancer, the Reagan
administration was concerned that the special relationship it had
forged with El Savador under Duarte's leadership could begin to wane.
   Duarte has been a favorite of Republicans and Democrats alike in
the Congress, and since his election four years ago, El Salvador has
received $1.5 billion in U.S. economic aid and $455 million in
military aid, levels unmatched elsewhere in Latin America.
   But Duarte's Christian Democratic Party is deeply split, raising
the clear possibility that victory in the 1989 presidential
elections may go to the rightist ARENA party, which made a strong
showing in legislative elections last March.
   Duarte was already a lame duck president when, according to U.S.
officials, he learned that the cancer which has affected his liver
and stomach is terminal. ``The only question is how long he will
live,'' said one official, adding that his survival may only be a
matter of months. Spokesmen at Walter Reed Army Hospital, where
Duarte has been confined since Wednesday, have discussed Duarte's
condition only in general terms.

claims that severity only aggravates the problem.
   Support for legalizing drugs appears confined to certain European
law- enforcment officers and drug-rehabilitation workers, who argue
that harsh laws encourage crime, help spread AIDS and do little to
cure addicts.
   Just two years after the European Parliament narrowly rejected a

on Sunday, four weeks after re-electing President Francois
Mitterrand, and are expected to give his Socialists a solid majority.
   The two-round election also is expected to spell doom for the
Communists and the far-right National Front in the lower house of
Parliament, where the legislative power lies.
   Mitterrand got 54 percent of the vote in the May 8 contest with
former Premier Jacques Chirac, the conservative presidential
candidate, and polls indicate a crushing victory for his party in
the Assembly elections.

   As mystifying as it may have seemed to many
people, last week's rally in the stock market came as no outlandish
surprise to analysts who monitor a phenomenon they call ``investor
sentiment.''
   To these observers, it didn't matter much that there seemed to
be no plausible economic reason for the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials to jump 74.68 points on Tuesday and 32.89 more on
Wednesday after several weeks of going nowhere.
   Regardless of what was happening to interest rates or economic
growth, the statistics they follow suggested the mood of the market
had grown so gloomy prices had virtually no place to go but up.
   One popular gauge of sentiment in the marketplace is a tally of
investment advisory services kept by Investors Intelligence of New
Rochelle, N.Y.
   As of May 27, the firm calculated that 54.9 percent of the 130
market forecasting services it monitors took a bearish view of the
outlook, against just 29.8 percent in the bullish camp.
   The remaining 15.3 percent were classified as looking for a
``correction,'' or short-term decline.
   That put the percentage of bears at higher levels even than in
the period immediately following the crash last fall _ indeed, at
an extreme not seen since the summer of 1982, or just before the
market took off on its five-year rally.
   The rationale for tracking sentiment in ways like this arises
from the inherently contrary nature of the stock market.
   When everyone has turned negative about prospects for stock
prices, the logic runs, there is nobody left to sell and depress
prices further. So the next shift in expectations is likely to be
in a positive direction.
   Conversely, market advances most often top out in times of
widespread euphoria, when everybody with money to invest has
already bought stocks.
   Says Investors Intelligence in its weekly reports: ``Since most
advisory services are trend followers, they are most bearish at
market bottoms and least bearish at market tops.''
   However much faith they may put in an indicator like this, most
analysts generally acknowledge that it is no sure-fire key to
unlocking the mysteries of the market.
   In September and October 1981, for example, the percentage of
bears ran consistently above 50 percent. But it wasn't until almost
a year later, in August 1982, that stocks pulled out of an extended
bear market and began a historic rise to new highs.
   Furthermore, a good many analysts who believed the recent
Investors Intelligence data were signaling an impending rally
aren't persuaded that the advance will last very long.
   Stan Weinstein, publisher of the advisory letter Professional
Tape Reader, said in a May 27 commentary that ``an oversold rally
should soon set in.''
   But taking a longer perspective, Weinstein maintained, ``the
major bear market that began in late August is still in force.''
   Charles LaLoggia, a Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser, said he
believed the sentiment data indicated that ``a strong bear market
rally is in store for the stock market.''
   It is possible, analysts say, to keep a weather eye on measures
of investor sentiment while not abandoning the belief that interest
rates, corporate profits and other fundamentals are important
forces in the ups and downs of the stock market.
   ``Faith in the stock market's ability to function efficiently to
discount investor concerns is not the same as pretending that the
problems do not exist,'' said Robert Salomon at Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   ``The pace of economic growth, political uncertainties and the
durability of the financial system are serious issues, with
important implications for stock prices.
   ``At current levels, however, we believe that market valuations
reflect a high level of investor skepticism about whether or not
any of these problems can be contained or avoided.''

   If you fancy antiques, stay away from the
shop two young cousins inherited from a mysterious uncle. If you're
into horror, come in and browse.
   ``Friday the 13th,'' a series of slice 'n' dice movies, has been
turned into a syndicated television show that offers its own little
shop of horrors.
   ``My cousin and I inherited the store from our Uncle Louis, who
had made a pact with the devil for immortality,'' said the actress
Robey, who stars as Micki Foster. ``What he didn't realize was that
the devil cursed every object in the store. The show deals with
greed, good and evil.
   ``When Uncle Louis tried to back out of his deal, he fell to
hell. He left us the store, and every week we have to find those
objects that are cursed. It's the age-old problem of temptation. I
think we were put on Earth to resist temptation. You have to love
God. Those objects are the antithesis of that.''
   Robey _ she goes professionally by her last name _ also stars
with John D. LeMay, who plays her cousin Ryan, and Christopher
Wiggins, who plays an eccentric dealer in antiquities named Jack
Marshak.
   Each episode they must fight to recover an object that has taken
possession of its owner. The owners want the objects because of the
power they give them. A television newsman, for instance, uses an
antique camera to create a duplicate of himself. The duplicate
commits a series of murders, and the newsman's ratings soar because
he's always one step ahead of everyone else.
   ``Micki is a classic overachiever,'' said Robey. ``She's
completely controlled by the system. She's been sheltered her whole
life. Now she gets thrown into these situations. Like anything,
through struggle comes grace. She's learning to be her own person
and learning what she likes, or more important, what she doesn't
like.''
   Robey had virtually no experience in film or television when she
won the role in ``Friday the 13th: The Series'' by beating out 300
other women who auditioned.
   ``We have wonderful guest actors that I get to meet and work
with,'' she said. ``These are people who have been acting for 30,
40 years, and it's a great opportunity for me to learn, as a person
and as an actress. I get to know other people's life experiences.''
   She was born Louise Robey in Canada; her father was a pilot in
the Royal Canadian Air Force, her mother had been a London stage
actress. She grew up in Canada, West Germany, Italy, England,
Scotland and France. She was educated at a boarding school in
Scotland that has academic connections with Oxford University.
   ``They bring you up to believe you'll go to university or go
into business,'' she said. ``It's not conducive to the arts. But
traveling around makes you a citizen of the world.
   ``I moved around so much when I was growing up that it's in my
blood,'' she said. ``I enjoy moving around. I don't like to be in
one place too long. A fantasy of mine is that I have gobs of old
friends I grew up with and that I can call up. But I do have many
new friends.''
   Robey started out with a dual career as a singer and a model.
   ``I've sung for the last 10 years,'' she said. ``I cut my first
record at 17 in Europe. I had a rock band called Robey, and later I
had a new wave band called Louise and the Creeps. I modeled at the
same time. I had this great desire to do comedy. I believe in the
power of the mind. If you project something strongly enough and
work hard enough, you'll get it.
   ``I moved to Los Angeles and fell into improv comedy. I
performed at dinner theaters and in Los Angeles for a year. I
studied acting in New York. But I think a lot of acting lessons put
students in ridiculous situations. Acting is being, it's not
acting. It's you and the situation. You're cast in a part because
you bring something to the role. Acting classes only give you the
technical parts.''
   Robey currently lives in Toronto, where the show is filmed for
Paramount Television.

<TEXT>
   A review of securities research letters over the
past six months reveals a vague, unintentional and disturbing
similarity with some astrological forecasts.
   Various economic indicators are aligned to produce outlooks that
tend to be recanted a few days later when, with nary an apology,
the same or other indicators are rearranged to produce another
result.
   Some forecasts are worded so broadly they might fit any
occasion. In many, there is little consistency from one week to the
next, with inflation replacing recession, economic strength
alternating with weakness, surge replacing plunge.
   In a few months' time the mood has switched so often that it is
difficult to find the common themes, other than fear, threat,
danger and the like.
   Extreme, often foreboding, views seem to have become acceptable.
One broker's letter notes a tendency to extrapolate the most recent
economic statistics into breathless forecasts for the next few
years.
   Richard Hoey, chief economist of Drexel Burnham Lambert,
observes that there have been ``rather hysterical swings in market
sentiment about the economy despite only gradual shifts in
underlying fundamentals.''
   As he suggests, the economic fundamentals have changed little
since October's market crash. But the views of those fundamentals
have changed almost daily, and they are likely to continue changing.
   Since the fall of 1987, Hoey and his associates have identified
six major themes, successive ones, and all ``overblown and lacking
perspective.'' And within those themes have been many times that
number of lesser gyrations.
   Following the Oct. 19 crash the popular theme was a forecast of
deflationary depression, or a revisitation of the disaster that
occurred beginning in 1929.
   Suspicions became aroused less than two months later. Where was
the economic weakness, the deflation? That became the new theme,
but nobody knew what to make of it. Analysts stewed about it for a
few weeks, then came up with the meaning.
   The new forecast became one of inflationary recession. No,
prices wouldn't fall, they would rise. No, there would be no
depression _ but to erase the negative altogether would be too
much. There would be recession.
   That thesis lasted a few weeks, but in January a brief surge in
the weekly unemployment claims gave rebirth to the thesis of
disinflationary recession. With variations, that view held until
spring and new statistics.
   The new statistics were fearsome; they showed economic strength.
This could not be good news any more than were earlier reports. In
the peculiar mindset of fear, strength could only be bad;
therefore, the theme of inflationary boom.
   Already, that view is tiresome to some. While loyal pessimists
are still dredging up ``evidence'' to support their latest fear,
others are wondering if, as in the past, this thesis too has been
overdone.
   Is it likely, they are asking, that the economy is shifting into
a self-correcting mode? Is it possible there aren't any great
surprises out there, and that economic forces will remain in
equilibrium for a while?
   Certainly.
   But with a record like theirs of the past six months, you can't
expect the seers to believe in equilibrium for more than a few
weeks. Not when a new set of economic statistics can be juggled
into brand new themes, mostly negative.

<HEAD>Platinum Rally Reflects Surge In Japanese Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's seemingly insatiable demand for platinum has been
largely responsible for a 25 percent increase in the metal's price
since the year began, and analysts say the rally is likely to
continue.
   Fear of rising inflation has prompted many U.S. investors to
return to the precious metals markets, which they pretty much
abandoned after the October stock market collapse, observers note.
   And the possibility of supply disruptions from South Africa, the
world's leading platinum producer, is never far from the minds of
traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange, where platinum for
near-month delivery has risen from about $500 a troy ounce in early
January to $625 this past week.
   Even without a breakdown in the South African pipeline, ``our
expectations are that primary supplies of platinum will for a
fourth successive year fall short of net demand,'' the London-based
precious-metals refiner Johnson Matthey PLC said in its recently
published annual platinum review.
   The British firm noted a 70 percent leap in Japanese imports of
platinum last year to 1.7 million ounces, or 50 percent of total
demand.
   The surge in Japanese demand corresponded with the dollar's
dramatic decline against the yen, which sent dollar-denominated
platinum to near 10-year-lows, in yen terms, in a country that
prizes platinum more than gold.
   ``Traditionally, the Japanese have looked at platinum the way
the rest of the world looks at gold,'' said Richard Levine, vice
president of Elders Futures Inc.'s precious metals and foreign
exchange group.
   ``Wedding rings in Japan are made of platinum, not gold,'' he
said. ``For one reason or another, platinum always was a desired
metal in Japan.''
   Johnson Matthey noted a huge increase in Japanese purchases of
platinum in the last two months of 1987 as U.S. investors, spooked
by the stock-market crash, moved their money out of precious metals
and into less-risky investments, such as government securities.
   Japanese buying continued apace as the sell-off of precious
metals in the United States sent platinum prices plunging below
$460 an ounce in February, when platinum futures actually traded at
a discount to gold, analysts said.
   New Japanese tax laws making precious metals more appealing than
savings accounts to investors also encouraged Japanese buying of
platinum, experts agree.
   Back in the United States, the calamity that many economists had
predicted last fall failed to materialize. Instead, the economy
appears to be picking up steam, which, combined with sharp
increases in agricultural commodity prices, has been interpreted as
a harbinger of rising inflation.
   The inflation fears have renewed interest in precious metals
among U.S. investors, who traditionally see gold, silver and
platinum as safe havens against rising prices.
   ``I think investors got tired of earning 7 percent or 8 percent
on their riskless investments, particularly when they think
inflation is picking up, and they're taking on a little bit of a
more speculative bent,'' said Jacques Luben, executive director of
investments for the New York-based Platinum Guild International.
   Analysts said the return of U.S. investors to the precious
metals has supported the entire complex. But platinum has responded
most sharply because of the already strong demand from the Far East.
   In addition, the economy's unexpectedly strong showing suggests
growth in industrial demand for platinum, which is used in
automobile pollution-control devices.
   The possibility that South Africa may halt platinum shipments to
the United States if Congress approves tougher trade sanctions also
has underpinned platinum's gains, but most analysts say the threat
is very remote.
   The platinum market, much thinner than the gold market, is
inherently volatile and some analysts warn that platinum's gains
may be overdone.
   ``The very fact that the market has even focused on South Africa
indicates the market is taking the most bullish stance it could
possibly take,'' said George Anagnos, metals analyst for Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``Some price increase is justified,'' he said, ``but unless this
bullish interpretation pans out in every respect, we're going to be
very vulnerable.''

<HEAD>October Crash `Can Happen Again,' Former NYSE President Warns</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any shred of innocence Wall Street may have
retained was lost in last October's crash, leaving stock exchanges
of the future to grapple with challenges their leaders could barely
imagine a few years ago.
   Robert J. Birnbaum, who left the New York Stock Exchange this
past week after serving as its president and chief operating
officer since 1985, warns that ``anything that happened once can
happen again.''
   Birnbaum, 60, is an amiable, self-effacing lawyer and elder
statesman among stock exchange managers. He came to the NYSE after
18 years at the smaller American Stock Exchange, including eight as
its president, giving him an excellent vantage point on the stock
market's recent rocky past and daunting future.
   He will become special counsel in the New York office of Dechert
Price & Rhoads, a large law firm.
   As the ``inside'' manager in charge of day-to-day operations at
the NYSE, Birnbaum lacked the high public profile of John J. Phelan
Jr., the exchange's chairman. In the panicky days of the October
collapse, while Phelan presided over packed news conferences in an
effort to calm the jittery investing public, Birnbaum quietly
worked behind the scenes to restore order to a market that had
veered out of control.
   In an interview last Thursday, his final day at the exchange,
Birnbaum took an inventory of what he had seen and the challenges
that lie ahead for the securities industry.
   One of the stock exchange's most imposing tasks is
technological. To help cope with another potential cataclysm, the
NYSE has to gear up to handle billions of daily trades, Birnbaum
said. The exchange was strained to the breaking point on Oct. 19 by
the plunge in stock prices and an unprecedented volume of trading _
about 600 million shares.
   Birnbaum's successor, 41-year-old Richard A. Grasso, is known
for his expertise with the exchange's computers and communications
systems. He is responsible for upgrades of the systems that
recently gave the Big Board the capacity to manage volume of 600
million shares a day as efficiently as it once handled 200 million.
   But Birnbaum doesn't believe the technological revolution will
eventually create a trading floor populated only by machines,
without the push-and-pull of human interaction.
   ``You don't allow technology alone to decide the type of
marketplace that is best for the United States,'' he insisted.
``You need the interface on the floor.''
   Another huge change that Birnbaum underscored is the growing
involvement of government with the stock exchanges _ especially
after the crash and the recent insider trading scandals. The Reagan
administration appointed a special panel to study the October
debacle and make recommendations, while Congress, the Securities
and Exchange Commission and others have also gotten involved.
   ``It's light-years different from what it used to be; there's a
much more intensive involvement with the government,'' Birnbaum
said. ``You have to touch the bases. (The government) turns slowly
... you have to deal with it delicately and slowly.''
   Birnbaum understands the government perspective on regulation of
the financial markets: He worked as an attorney at the SEC in
Washington from 1961 to 1966 before going to the American Stock
Exchange.
   As NYSE president, Birnbaum tried to convince brokerage firms
that they must regulate themselves, or Washington would step in and
do it for them. He was instrumental in fashioning a package of new
rules for exchange members early last year in response to the
insider trading scandals.
   Birnbaum is a staunch defender, on the other hand, of the NYSE's
``specialist'' system _ which has come under criticism for not
doing more to smoothe out the market during the crash. Specialists
are appointed by exchanges to make markets in individual stocks.
They are charged with ensuring the market is orderly, even if that
means buying and selling equities from their own accounts.
   Reports this past week, first published by the New York Times,
indicated the specialists enjoyed their most profitable year ever
in 1987 despite the crash and yet failed to bolster their capital
reserves to protect themselves against another disaster.
   ``The specialist system was outstanding'' during the crash,
Birnbaum maintained. ``I haven't seen, in my own time in the
business, a system that works better.''

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government said the nation's civilian unemployment rate
rose to 5.6 percent in May, only its second increase in 20 months.
Other reports showed the government's economic forecasting gauge
rose modestly, orders to U.S. factories surged, construction
spending increased and sales of new homes climbed during April.
Farm reports showed exports up in March and prices to farmers up in
May.
   _The nation's largest general retailers reported disappointing
sales again in May as a long buying slump continued. Consumers were
said to be bothered by high installment debts and cool weather and
bored with current fashions.
   _A private survey found contracting for new construction
projects declined 6 percent in April from the previous month,
extending a downward slide that began last fall.
   _The government said foreign purchases of U.S. businesses
dropped 22 percent to $30.5 billion in 1987, the first dip since
1983.
   _The standard of living of workers in other major countries has
risen four times as fast as the U.S. standard of living in the past
15 years, a study on American competitiveness said.
   _The government has concluded that both Eastern Airlines and its
sister carrier, Continental Airlines, are safe to fly, but a bitter
labor-management war at Eastern raises possible safety risks if
allowed to continue.
   _A proposed mandatory drug-testing program for airline workers
prompted sharp criticism from airline labor unions, which argued
there is no evidence of a problem in the industry to warrant it.
   _Financier Carl C. Icahn sought to turn up the heat in his fight
with Texaco Inc., calling together securities analysts to try to
convince them he has the financing to follow through on his
takeover bid. Many analysts remained skeptical about his
$60-per-share offer.
   _Burlington Northern Inc., owner of the nation's largest
railroad, announced a major restructuring that includes separating
non-transportation operations into a subsidiary that eventually
will be spun off as a separate company.
   _Publishing giant Macmillan Inc. announced a major restructuring
that it valued at more than $1.66 billion, seeking to counter a
hostile takeover bid by Texas investor Robert M. Bass.
   _An investment group including Asher B. Edelman offered to buy
the telecommunications company Centel Corp. for $2.8 billion in
cash.
   _The Federal Trade Commission approved American Stores Co.'s
plans to acquire Lucky Stores Inc., provided American divests
itself of stores in California and its interest in a Midwestern
grocery chain.
   _Pittsburgh-based Koppers Co., one of the largest U.S. road
repair companies, dropped its resistance to a $1.7 billion takeover
bid from British industrialist Brian C. Beazer. But city officials
in Pittsburgh refused to give up the fight, asking a federal judge
to delay the takeover.
   _Billionaire computer pioneer H. Ross Perot launched a new
consulting business with a contract to study cost-cutting for the
U.S. Postal Service. But there was concern on Wall Street that
Perot had lured away talent from the company he once served as
chairman, General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems unit.
   _The Supreme Court, in a victory for bargain hunters and
discount dealers, upheld federal regulations that allow a
multibillion-dollar ``gray market'' in which costly imported goods
are sold at reduced prices.
   _Aspirin sales shot up 41 percent in early February after the
release of a widely publicized study on aspirin and heart attacks,
but volume quickly returned to previous levels, statistics from a

<HEAD>Muni Market One of the Bright Spots In the Credit Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The municipal bond market has held up well in
recent weeks despite the sharp rise in interest rates, becoming one
of the brighter spots in the credit markets.
   And the buzzword around the marketplace is ``premium.''
   Traders and analysts say several factors have helped support
municipal bond prices while keeping yields down, among them,
continued disenchantment with the stock market, concerns about
future tax increases and a decline in supply.
   ``The municipal market is on a roll, and it is not likely to end
soon,'' according to a recent report by investment bankers John
Nuveen & Co. Inc. ``In each of the last three months, demand has
exceeded supply, and the June outlook is for more of the same.''
   Municipal bonds took a beating last spring due to a resurgence
in interest rates caused by a deteriorating dollar in foreign
exchange. Interest-rate jitters resurfaced this year causing state
and local governments to shy away from issuing more bonds, noted
Neal Attermann, manager of municipal bond research at Kidder
Peabody & Co.
   For the first five months of this year, the volume of issues
from state and local governments totaled about $39.8 billion, down
15 percent from about $46.6 billion the same period a year ago,
according to Securities Data Co.-Bond Buyer, which tracks the
municipal market.
   The data showed the decline largely could be blamed on a drop in
refunding issues, bonds sold for the sole purpose of retiring
earlier debt carrying a higher interest rate. Since rates have
risen, many municipalities saw no point in going to market.
   The volume of refunding issues plunged 53 percent, to about
$13.6 billion during the January-May period from around $29.2
billion last year, Securities Data said.
   Traders, though, are reporting a slight increase in activity
recently. Several new issues this past week alone have come to
market, including $200 million in general obligation bonds from New
York City and a $184 million issue from Georgia. A few others,
including a $1 billion refunding issue from Louisiana, are in the
wings, traders say.
   Still, some analysts predict rising interest rates due to the
economy's apparent growth may continue to keep municipal issuers
out of the market. And at the same time, they say, demand isn't
expected to let up.
   ``Since mid-March demand for municipals has increased steadily,
first on a seasonal basis, due to the approach of April 15, and,
subsequently, because of a growing realization that taxes are
likely to be headed upward, without the creation of any new
shelters,'' the Nuveen noted.
   ``People want to get that tax exemption now,'' added James F.
Lynch, editor of the monthly investor newsletter Lynch Municipal
Bond Advisory.
   Attermann noted that the rising demand and declining supply of
munis have made them more attractive than some Treasury bonds with
comparable maturities.
   For those who are worried that interest rates will go through
the roof, causing their bonds to erode in value, a number of
analysts are recommending investments in ``premium'' bonds. These
bonds sell for above par, or $1,000, but deliver a higher total
return to investors than bonds of similar term purchased at face
value.
   ``The high coupon (rate) of this investment prevents a fast
erosion of principal in a declining market,'' Lynch said.
   Lynch especially recommends premium municipal bonds that have
been ``pre-refunded'' by issuers, meaning borrowers already have
put other securities such as Treasury obligations in trust to
redeem the bonds. Investors, therefore, don't run the risk of
having those bonds ``called,'' or refunded before they mature, he
said.

<BYLINE>Inflation Mania Cools on Wall Street
^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fears of an inflationary boom have loosened
their grip a little on Wall Street's financial markets in recent
days.
   True, the economy has remained much stronger, by all the
evidence, than most people expected just a few months ago.
   True, the Federal Reserve has taken some precautionary steps
lately to tighten credit, signaling its intentions not to let the
heat get turned up too high.
   True as well, prices of commodities ranging from soybeans to
metals have been moving up.
   Nevertheless, stock and bond traders have apparently decided
they had spooked themselves unduly with visions of a new
inflationary specter that would force policymakers to put the
economy under severe restraints.
   As Jack Lavery, research director at Merrill Lynch, put it, the
markets' recent bout of inflationary fears reflected ``valid but
exaggerated concerns.
   ``Inflation is creeping up,'' Lavery said. ``But the rise in
inflation is likely to be just cyclical, rather than secular
(long-term).
   ``The trend of secular disinflation _ gradual declines in the
peak rates of inflation _ still appears to be in place.''
   Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities, said
it was noteworthy that the Commerce Department, in issuing an
upward-revised figure for economic growth for the first quarter,
lowered its gauge of inflation for the January-March period from an
annual rate of 2.4 percent to 1.7 percent.
   Yardeni acknowledged that recent price jumps in raw industrial
commodities have been worrisome. However, he added, ``we're
inclined to think that fears of an inflationary boom are
exaggerated.''
   The Fed has done its part to improve the mood on Wall Street by
making no change in the discount rate, at a time when many analysts
were talking of an imminent increase from the current 6 percent.
   ``In my view, raising the discount rate at this juncture would
amount to a high degree of overkill,'' said Stanley Berge, an
analyst at Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day Inc. ``The Fed has already
taken steps to slow inflation.''
   Bolstered in no small measure by an ebbing of inflation fears,
stock and bond prices rallied briskly in the past week. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks jumped 114.86 to 2,071.30,
for its largest weekly point gain ever.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.65 to 150.31;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market 10.20 to
376.86, and the American Stock Exchange market value index 10.38 to
300.88.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 216.33 million shares a day, up
from 135.75 million the week before.
   Richard Hoey, economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the
markets have been suffering from ``hysterical swings in market
sentiment about the economy despite only gradual shifts in
underlying fundamentals.''
   This has created a ``theme-of-the-month club'' on Wall Street,
he added, with an inflationary boom as the latest theme.
   While the club ``may soon begin to tire of the boom case,'' he
said, inflation fears may not be totally unjustified.
   ``The inflation risk in the U.S. economy is not the result of a
boom but rather of the reality that 5{ years of expansion have
sharply reduced the excess capacity in the goods and labor markets.
   ``A modest acceleration in inflation in 1988 in a moderate wage
environment should be followed by a stronger inflationary
acceleration in 1989 because of a cumulative capacity tightening
whether or not a boom pace of growth occurs.
   ``Fears of powerful inflationary acceleration,'' in Hoey's view,
``are merely premature, not incorrect.''

<HEAD>Economic Growth Contnues, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy grew for the 22nd consecutive month
on the strength of new orders in May, according to a survey of
corporate purchasing managers released Sunday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Managers said its index
of economic activity rose to 55.1 percent last month from 54.9
percent in April.
   The index had fallen slightly the first three months of the
year, indicating a slowdown in the pace of economic growth.
   A reading above 50 percent generally indicates economic
expansion, while a reading below that benchmark indicates the
economy is declining, the group says.
   For the first five months of this year, the index has averaged
55.1 percent.
   ``The economy continues to expand at a moderate rate,'' said
Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing managers' survey
committee.
   ``New orders fueled by robust growth in export orders, increased
at a brisk pace and all but assure the first half of 1988 will end
with a record of modest but healthy economic growth.''
   An increase in new orders, particularly among exporters, helped
boost the May index, although the growth in production slowed from
the previous month, the report said.
   Thirty percent of the 250 purchasing managers surveyed said
their companies had more new orders, compared with 16 percent that
reported fewer orders. Fifty-four percent said orders were running
at the same rate as in April.
   In April, 37 percent of the respondents reported more orders,
compared with 14 percent who reported less and 49 percent the same.
   Of those members exporting, 35 percent reported higher orders in
May, compared to 40 percent in April.
   The respondents in the survey also reported:
   _Production continued to grow, those reporting better results
fell to 27 percent from 37 percent in April. Eleven percent
reported a decline in production, compared with 53 percent in the
previous month.
   _The pace of vendor deliveries picked up slightly. Nineteen
percent of the executives reported slower deliveries, down from 21
percent in April, while 76 percent reported no change in the
delivery rate, up from 74 percent the previous month.
   _Inventories expanded. A quarter of managers reported rises in
inventories, against 17 percent reporting drops. In April, 20
percent said inventories had risen, while 15 percent reported
decreases.
   _Rising prices led declines for the 20th consecutive month.
Sixty-four percent of the executives said prices were up, while 35
percent said they were down. In April, 70 percent said prices rose
and 29 percent said they fell.
   _Employment fell slightly, with 14 percent of the managers
reporting increased hiring at their companies, compared with 16
percent in April. Eleven percent reported a drop in jobs in both
months.
