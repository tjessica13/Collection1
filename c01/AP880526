   Striking TV and movie scriptwriters claimed
they had split management ranks Thursday after 64 producers,
including the makers of ``The Cosby Show'' and Johnny Carson's talk
show, signed independent contracts with the writers' union.
   Several of the firms that signed with the Writers Guild of
America produce successful television programs for NBC.
   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers,
representing the industry's biggest producers, downplayed the
signings, which represent a significant break in the 12-week strike.
   The walkout has forced delays in the start of the fall
television season and reruns of such shows as ``Late Night with
David Letterman'' and ``The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.''
   The 9,000-member Writers Guild of America was scheduled to vote
Thursday night in New York and Los Angeles on contracts with
smaller, so-called independent producers.
   Voting results wouldn't be known until Friday, said union
spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden in Los Angeles.
   ``We're anticipating ratification,'' Ms. Rhoden said. ``We see
it strategically as a good move at this time to break the logjam
with the alliance.''
   Ms. Rhoden released the names of the independent producers and
the terms of their three-year contract with the WGA before members
gathered to vote on the proposal. The contract includes increases
in foreign residual payments and provides writers with greater
creative input.
   The list of 64 production companies includes the Carsey-Werner
Company, which produces two of the most popular shows on
television, ``The Cosby Show'' and ``A Different World.''
   The makers of ``Tonight'' signed a contract and the producers of
``Late Night'' have agreed to a contract but haven't signed, said
union President George Kirgo. Others signing were producers of
``Alf'' and ``The Muppets.''
   Also on the list are Michael Landon Productions, which makes
``Highway to Heaven'' and You and Me Kid Productions, the maker of
the now-cancelled ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.''
   Most of the producers appear to be film companies, such as The
Gaby Film Group Inc., and some, such as Paul Keyes Productions,
produce TV specials.
   None of the 217 big producers who belong to the alliance have
signed independent contracts, management spokesman Herb Steinberg
said Thursday.
   The large producers, whose ranks include such big-time
moviemakers as Columbia Pictures and such TV giants as MTM and
Lorimar, employ 80 percent of the industry's writers and supply 84
percent of prime-time TV, he noted.
   ``The alliance producers are holding strong,'' Steinberg said.
   ``This is all very, very interesting, but it has no impact on
the new season or on the contract negotiations,'' Steinberg said.
``What they're talking about makes no change in the point of
conflict, which are the deficits for productions of one-hour
prime-time TV shows and the depressed market for those shows in
syndication.''
   Nearly 180 producers had discussed independent agreements, which
meet the writers' demands on residual payments they receive when
shows are rerun and for consultation on script changes made during
filming, she said.
   Those are the main points of contention in the strike, which
began March 7.
   On Monday, both sides sat down with a federal mediator for the
first time since April 8. The talks at alliance headquarters in the
Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks failed to produce agreement on
any issue.
   Negotiators agreed to meet in small groups Saturday and set
another full bargaining session Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A friend and ex-roommate of Laurie Dann,
the woman who fatally shot a child and wounded six people, was
charged with making harassing telephone calls and committed to a
psychiatric ward, police said Thursday.
   Sheri L. Taylor, 34, of suburban Highwood was arrested late
Wednesday by members of a county task force investigating last
Friday's shootings by Ms. Dann, said Winnetka Police Chief Herbert
Timm.
   ``We are in the process of determining the extent of Ms.
Taylor's involvement with Laurie Dann,'' who killed herself after
the shootings, Timm said at a news conference.
   Investigators want to know if Ms. Taylor was recently in contact
with Ms. Dann or involved in her violent rampage in this affluent
suburb north of Chicago, said Assistant State's Attorney Randy
Stewart.
   Ms. Taylor is accused of threatening the life of her ex-husband,
Scott Taylor, and their children, who live with their father,
Stewart and Timm said. She also was arrested for failing to appear
on a drunken driving charge in Evanston, Stewart said in a
telephone interview.
   Stewart said authorities were alarmed to discover Ms. Taylor had
a valid Illinois firearms ownership card and had purchased a
.357-caliber Magnum pistol within the past year. The gun was found
during a police search of her apartment, he said.
   Stewart said Ms. Dann and Ms. Taylor had been roommates about a
year ago.
   After her arrest, Timm said, the woman was involuntarily
committed to a psychiatric unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago.
   Last Friday, Ms. Dann started a small fire in a home, shot six
children at Hubbard Woods Elementary School, killing one, and then
shot and wounded a 20-year-old man at a nearby house, where she
later shot and killed herself.
   Ms. Dann also sent or delivered about two dozen packages of
snacks and juice laced with arsenic to acquaintances.
   The FBI said Thursday that Ms. Dann apparently acted alone in
sending the poisoned food and drinks.
   ``Nobody else has surfaced as an accomplice,'' said Charles
Steinmetz, supervisor of the Madison office of the FBI, where Ms.
Dann obtained the poison.
   At Evanston Hospital, shooting victim 8-year-old Mark Teborek
was released Thursday while another victim, Lindsay Fisher, 8, was
upgraded to fair condition. Kathryn Miller, 7, and Robert Trossman,
6, were in good condition.
   At Highland Park Hospital, Peter Munro, 8, and Philip Andrew,
20, _ who was shot when Ms. Dann took over his family's home _ were
in fair condition.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said
Thursday that talks with the United States about his future broke
down when the U.S. envoy presented him with an ultimatum that the
U.S. terms be accepted immediately.
   Noriega, speaking to a cheering crowd that packed the 500-seat
National Assembly, accused the United States of ``political,
economic and military'' aggression against Panama.
   ``The world must know that the conversation sustained with the
envoy of President Reagan broke down when he presented us with an
ultimatum in which Panama had to immediately accept his last
offer,'' said Noriega, who as head of the 15,000-member military is
the de facto leader of the country.
   ``I know it and I say so because I was there. (U.S. Secretary of
State) George Shultz wasn't there,'' he told the crowd. Hundreds
more listened outside near a loudspeaker.
   The general did not elaborate. He said Panama had accepted
several U.S. proposals, but added: ``Even this wasn't sufficient.
The United States desired an ultimatum.''
   In Guatemala City, President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo offered
Thursday to act as mediator between the two countries. He told
reporters Panama was experiencing ``a radicalization against the
United States that is dangerous for the region and that moreover is
causing grave damage to the Panamanian nation.''
   The Guatemalan chief executive said he had spoken with U.S. and
Panamanian officials on the issue. He did not identify them.
   Cerezo met Thursday with James Michel, the U.S. ambassador to
Guatemala.
   Noriega appeared in the National Assembly to answer questions
about what the government insists were ``conversations,'' not
negotiations, on a possible arrangement under which he would leave
power.
   The speech was attended by 39 of the assembly's 67 members.
Those absent included the 20 representatives of opposition parties.
   Noriega said Panama had become a pawn for candidates in the U.S.
political campaign.
   They ``are using the flag of Panama in whatever way is
convenient for them'' and some candidates want ``to bury files that
weigh on their shoulders,'' said Noriega, who commands Panama's
military and police. He did not identify them.
   Noriega repeated his conditions for leaving power: Extra troops
sent to U.S. bases in Panama must be withdrawn and the position of
Manuel Solis Palma, whom he installed as president, must be
guaranteed.
   He said the United States ``must respect Panama.''
   ``I refer the North American people and their candidates who are
using the flag of Panama to win votes to the words of one of their
philosophers, Thomas Jefferson, when he said the politician thinks
of the next elections, the statesman of the next generations,'' the
general said.
   Referring to the Panama Canal treaties of 1977, Noriega said:
``The United States has mocked what has been signed. It has mocked
the signing of the Torrijos-Carter treaties.'' Gen. Omar Torrijos,
Noriega's predecessor and mentor, reached the accord with President
Jimmy Carter.
   Washington wants Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drug
charges, to leave the country and Eric Arturo Delvalle to return as
president in exchange for lifting economic sanctions and possibly
dropping the drug charges.
   Noriega dismissed Delvalle on Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle
had tried to fire the general as commander of the Panama Defense
Forces.
   Solis Palma told a women's organization earlier Thursday that
American negotiators told Noriega in March to be out of the country
within 48 hours or face the consequences. After Noriega refused, he
said, the Americans softened their manner.
   He said talks failed because the United States would not promise
to keep him on as president or to help with Panama's economic
crisis, which stems partly from the U.S. sanctions.
   The final deal would have dropped the drug charges in return for
Noriega giving up command of the armed forces Aug. 12 and leaving
the country in September, Solis Palma said, but added:
   ``When we talked to them about the need for them to give
guarantees and proofs that they would look for ways to recover in
part the economic damage caused to the Republic of Panama they came
back with promises but never followed through.''
   According to Solis Palma, the United States would promise to
release $50 million in Panamanian assets frozen in American banks
only if he chose a national unity Cabinet that in turn would pick a
president ``who could not be Solis Palma.''
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the opposition Christian
Democrats, said Thursday the negotiations failed because of a
growing division in the military and the United States should have
been aware of it.
   ``Errors by the United States were not the only factor although
they were a factor,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Lashes ``Liberal Elite,'' Dukakis and Jackson Debate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 20 grafs to UPDATE with more debate material;
picks up 14th graf pvs, bgng, The Massachusetts</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush lashed out Wednesday at political
liberals, accusing them of destroying a bipartisan consensus toward
the Soviet Union, while Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis said Bush's advocacy of the death penalty for drug
dealers was ``the height of hypocrisy.''
   During a one-hour debate in San Francisco, Jesse Jackson pressed
his Democratic rival for specific budget details as well as on his
policy toward South Africa. But the two Democrats saved their
strongest comments for criticism of the Reagan administration for
its dealings with Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   After the debate, Jackson and Dukakis met privately.
   With President Reagan en route to a Moscow summit, the two
Democrats said they hoped the superpowers would move toward less
reliance on military solutions to world problems.
   Dukakis said the superpowers were ``wandering around the world
like lonesome cowboys'' intervening militarily.
   Jackson said he wished Reagan ``godspeed and a good astrologist,
as he believes in both'' and added he hoped the superpowers would
``look beyond the arms race.''
   The debate _ their first in more than a month _ took place only
hours after Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced the
failure of negotiations aimed at getting Noriega to relinquish
power in Panama. Shultz said no new talks were scheduled.
   Bush said the fact the negotiations had broken down ``doesn't
depress me.''
   ``I'm convinced Noriega will be out of power,'' Bush told
reporters in Lakehurst, N.J. ``We'll have to go back and figure it
out.''
   Bush has advocated the death penalty for drug kingpins.
   When Jackson was asked if he supported that position, he
replied, ``I do not. I do not think we have the moral authority to
execute in that sense. We have the obligation to take them off the
streets and above all, do not deal with them and give them
sanctuary and put them on the CIA payroll.''
   Dukakis then interjected, ``It's the height of hypocrisy for
people in the administration to be advocating the death penalty for
drug pushers while they are doing business with Noriega and
funneling aid to the Contras through convicted drug dealers.
   ``I don't know of anything phonier than that kind of policy.''
   Questioned about his opposition to the death penalty, Dukakis
said, ``You don't have to be for the death penalty to be tough on
crime.''
   He said views on the death penalty would not be a standard for
judges he would appoint as president.
   ``I don't apply ideological litmus tests,'' he said.
   Dukakis said trying to forumlate a detailed budget plan so far
in advance would be ``a serious mistake.''
   Jackson kept pressing him, however, saying that ``the governor
is laying out a budget of prommises but not a budget of numbers.''
   When Jackson asked Dukakis if he would use military force
against South Africa, the Massachusetts governor replied that he
would press for more effective sanctions.
   When Jackson kept pressing him, Dukakis said, ``Yes, one aspect
of a tough anti-terrorist policy is the use of military force
against terrorist base camps. But there are many ways to attack
terrorism.''
   The Massachusetts governor expects to lock up the Democratic
presidential nomination on June 7, when California, New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico hold primaries, the last major contests of
the long pre-convention campaign.
   During a stop at the U.S. Capitol before he flew west, Dukakis
picked up endorsements from 18 members of Congress who will be
``super delegates'' to the Democratic National Convention in July.
   Bush, at West Point, N.Y., told cadets at the U.S. Military
Academy commencement ceremony that the ``liberal elite'' had
abandoned what he called the bipartisan consensus for maintaining a
strong national defense. Aides billed the Bush speech as
non-political.
   Standing under a small canopy in the pouring rain, Bush never
mentioned Dukakis or Jackson, but left no doubt of his targets.
   ``I'm sure they'd claim it isn't so and they're all in favor of
a strong defense,'' Bush said. ``They look the part, sober and
measured in their gray suits, moving their hands on the Sunday talk
shows with just the right amount of gravity and earnestness.''
   ``But what are we to think, when they say they're for a strong
defense but they oppose every new weapons system that would
preserve that strength?'' Bush asked.
   Bush spoke only hours after President Reagan departed for Europe
and a superpower summit in Moscow.
   He cautioned against allowing summit meetings to lead toward
complacency toward the Soviets.
   ``We must be confident that those who will lead our country
understand what it means to stand up to a challenge and meet our
commitments,'' Bush said. ``We must be confident that they will
pursue negotiations with the Soviets realistically.''
   He said that under Democratic presidents Harry Truman and John
F. Kennedy and then under Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower
there was bipartisan agreement on the need to deal with the Soviets
from a position of strength.
   ``There are some today who have abandoned those principles,'' he
said. ``The liberal elite do not understand _ they never understood
_ the common sense behind the consensus.''
   Later, the vice president called for the naming of an
independent counsel to study recent alleged financial irregularties
surrounding House Speaker Jim Wright.
   ``If they want to talk about (Attorney General Edwin) Ed Meese,
how about talking about the speaker?'' he said. Meese's legal
problems have been frequently raised by the Democrats.
   While in Washington, Dukakis met with a former rival, Democratic
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, a private meeting he later
described as ``very cordial.''
   They met in Dukakis' hotel room and Gore still withheld any
endorsement of the apparent nominee. The senator wrote to his
delegates last week and urged them to stay loyal for the time
being. Gore has nearly 400 delegates.
   The 18 congressional delegates Dukakis picked up moved his total
to nearly 1,700. He needs 2,081 for a convention majority.
   Jackson has less than 1,000 in the latest Associated Press
survey.
   During meetings at the Capitol, Dukakis said, ``We are not going
to concede one single state to the Republicans in the fall.''
   One of his sessions was with Western members of Congress and he
said, ``The strategy is to win the West.'' He said it was ``one of
the great political paradoxes'' that while Democrats run well in
the region in contests for Congress, governor and other offices,
the party's candidates have been virtually shut out there in recent
presidential elections. The last Democratic presidential candidate
to carry the West was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.

   After a boldly existential ending, ``St.
Elsewhere'' exists no more.
   The show, which won a dozen Emmy Awards, concluded Wednesday
night with a surprise conclusion revealing the entire six years of
the critically acclaimed series as the fantasy of an autistic child.
   ``We've had the ending for a number of years,'' said Bruce
Paltrow, one of the show's executive producers.
   ``We were looking for the metaphor for all of us to have created
this fiction. To place the entire six years into the imagination of
boy who could not communicate with the outside world, but had this
staggeringly exciting inner life was we thought an excitingly
existential end to the series.''
   When it made its debut six season ago, ``St. Elsewhere'' was
part of a wave of creativity from MTM Productions that
revolutionized stodgy network programming in the 1980s. ``St.
Elsewhere'' followed ``Hill Street Blues'' onto NBC and was
inevitably compared to the earlier show's groundbreaking style,
overlapping dialogue and hand-held cameras.
   But ``St. Elsewhere'' went beyond ``Hill Street'' in social
satire. At times serious, at times hilarious, it took on politics,
religion, AIDS, heterosexual and homosexual rape, cancer, drug
abuse, the afterlife, corporate indifference, its own network and
previous shows from MTM. One entire episode revolved around a male
patient's insistence that he was Mary Richards from ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show.''
   The ``St. Elsewhere'' writers had wanted to go all out in the
final episode, but prohibitive costs kept their script, a
futuristic view of St. Eligius at the edge of apocalypse, from
being filmed.
   In the end, prohibitive costs knocked down not only the intended
final episode but the show itself. ``St. Elsewhere'' was produced
at a loss by MTM at a time when hour-long series are not selling
well in syndication.
   The show will be seen in reruns, but MTM will not release
details of its syndication sales.
   In an apparently personal, inside joke in the dialogue of the
final script, Dr. Wayne Fiscus (Howie Mandel), says of his years at
St. Eligius, ``Grueling hours, bad food, egomania, death and moral
confusion. It'll be hard to leave.''
   The producers of the show have long since left and are busy on a
new series for NBC, ``Tattinger's,'' an offbeat romantic comedy set
in a popular New York restaurant. It is being shot on location here
and stars Stephen Collins, Blythe Danner and Jerry Stiller. The
show is on NBC's fall schedule in the time period that ``St.
Elsewhere'' is leaving.

<HEAD>Senate Republicans Lock Themselves In Room During Tax Hikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Senate Republicans locked themselves
in a room in protest Wednesday night as Democratic senators adopted
two tax increase measures totaling more than $100 million.
   The Senate quickly approved a $70 million income tax loophole
closing measure and a 5 percent sales tax on cigarettes designed to
raise nearly $40 million and sent the measures to the House. As the
vote took place, six Senate Republicans sat in a locked room with
the telephones either in use or off the hook.
   The Republicans said they were caucusing and were hoping to
delay action on the tax increase proposals while at the same time
drawing media attention to the tax bills. The Senate, with many
Democrats also absent from the chamber, approved the bills on a
voice vote.
   ``For a $100 million bill to go through the Massachusetts Senate
without a roll call is outrageous,'' said Sen. David Locke, who led
the Republican caucus.
   Locke and fellow Sen. Paul Cellucci are top officials in Vice
President George Bush's Massachusetts presidential campaign.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential
nominee, has called for additional revenue and spending cuts to
balance the $11.8 billion state budget, but has maintained it can
be done without raising cigarette taxes.
   He has campaigned for president, in part, on his ability to
balance the state's budget and on his success in reducing taxes
over the past six years.
   Senate President William Bulger derided the Republicans' move as
a publicity stunt.
   ``The minority party was well aware of what's been going on,''
Bulger said. He said that after several attempts to call the
Republicans failed, a court officer knocked on the door and
informed the Republicans that a vote was taking place.
   Two of the eight Republicans in the 40-member Massachusetts
Senate were absent.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
ended two-day's hospital treatment for chest pains Thursday, saying
he will ask U.S. officials to let him return to his homeland for
the funeral of his mother.
   ``I'd like to go home and preside over the funeral rites of my
mother,'' Marcos said from a wheelchair during a news conference
before he was discharged from St. Francis Medical Center.
   Marcos said his application for permission for him and his
family go to the Philippines and return to the Unites States at
will would be submitted Thursday or Friday at the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization office in Honolulu.
   When asked whether the application would be a request to return
permanently to the Philippines, Marcos replied, ``Well, what else?
I would like the ordinary rights of a citizen.''
   President Corazon Aquino, saying Marcos poses a threat to
national security, has repeatedly rejected his pleas to return for
the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4 at
age 95.
   Marcos said Mrs. Aquino should reconsider because, ``I've told
them I will not bother them ... but will hold back the people from
starting violence. She alone will not be able to hold them back.''
   Marcos is under ``a prevent departure notice,'' which means he
needs permission to leave the United States, said INS district
director William Craig.
   Marcos said he did not know how long it would take for the INS
and Philippine government to respond to his latest request. He said
no date has been set for the funeral.
   Marcos was accompanied by his wife, Imelda, several aides, a
nurse and his physician, Dr. Azucena Ignacio, who said Marcos would
be able to travel.
   Ignacio said Marcos' chest pains were caused by arthritis or
inflammation in the area of the left sixth rib. She said Marcos
improved dramatically by resting and was being treated with
painkillers.

   A restaurant owner was shot and killed in
this Basque town near San Sebastian in what provincial government
officials said appeared to be the work of the Basque separatist
group ETA.
   According to witnesses, one or two men shot and killed Sebastian
Azpiri, 38, as he walked to his restaurant on Wednesday night.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for the deaths of three policemen
and a retired general so far this year.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, the separatist group has claimed
more than 600 killings in its campaign to seek independence from
Spain for the three-province Basque region in northern Spain.

   The Greatest Show On Earth will venture
across the Pacific for the first time as Ringling Bros. and Barnum
& Bailey Circus goes on tour in Japan, circus officials announced
Wednesday.
   The 175 artists with the circus will be performing under a tent
for the first time in three decades for practical reasons, said
Kenneth Feldman, owner, president and producer of the circus.
   ``You could never fit an elephant in the doors'' of most
Japanese arenas built mainly for sumo wrestling, he said.
   Since 1956, the circus has performed in indoor arenas on its
U.S. tours.
   ``I would never go if I couldn't keep the same standards I have
in this country,'' Feld said.
   Those standards include the star attraction, an animal billed as
a ``living unicorn.'' Animal rights organizations say the circus
animal is a goat with a bull horn surgically implanted in its head.
   The 16-week engagement will start July 3 in Sapporo and include
a seven-week run in downtown Tokyo with performances in Osaka. The
tour is the first Far East engagement in the 118-year history of
the circus.
   The show also features Jose Medina inside The Globe of Death on
a supercharged motorcycle, The Carrillo Brothers high-wire artists
and the Flying Espanas, who execute triple somersaults in midair.
   Ninety-five trucks will carry the circus from city to city.
   Feld was to announce details of the tour Thursday in Washington,
where the circus has its corporate headquarters. Winter
headquarters are in Venice.
   Feld said the Japanese people have more leisure time since
switching from a six-day work week to a five-day work week.
   ``I expect receptions like we get in every city in the United
States where children of all ages are thrilled,'' he said.
   Organizing the massive transportation project with contingents
of elephants, horses and camels was an undertaking twice the size
of what Feld had anticipated but was worth the effort.
   ``I wouldn't have done it if I didn't love it,'' he said.
   The domestic tour of 85 U.S. cities by two other circus units
will be unaffected by the Japanese engagements.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after Atlantic City started
its gamble with legalized gaming, it has won a giant new industry
but lost its innocence.
   Even skeptics won't deny the resort has seen a dramatic economic
turnaround since the first casino opened May 26, 1978, and turned
the island into the most visited tourist destination in the United
States.
   The casinos provide year-round jobs, tax benefits for the
state's elderly and disabled and a percentage of gaming revenues
for rebuilding Atlantic City neighborhoods.
   But even the most optimistic observer can find flaws in how the
``experiment'' turned out, particularly in the deteriorated
neighborhoods and shuttered shop windows just steps from the casino
hotel lobbies.
   Before 1978, the saying was, ``The last one to cross the bridge
turns out the lights,'' recalls Atlantic City Police Chief Joseph
Pasquale. The city was dying.
   Then, in a honky-tonk burst of flashing lights and ringing
bells, Atlantic City was reborn. Hundreds of buses and cars now
squeeze down narrow streets each day. Big-name entertainers are
returning to the showrooms, and Convention Hall throbs with trade
shows, heavyweight fights and other extravaganzas.
   H. Steven Norton, executive vice president of Resorts
International Casino Hotel, recalls the ``exhilarating rush'' when
his casino opened as the city's first legal gaming hall. Thousands
of people lined up outside, waiting for a chance to drop quarters
into slot machines and slap bills onto green felt.
   Last year, Atlantic City reported more than $2.8 billion in
gaming revenues and more than 30 million visitors.
   Twelve casino hotels tower over the city's Boardwalk and the
once-barren marina section. The New Jersey gaming industry is the
focus of high-stakes Wall Street business deals. And with more than
40,000 casino employees, unemployment in the region has declined to
record lows.
   Yet many tourists cluck in dismay at the decaying houses that
still line the city's streets _ thoroughfares made famous by the
Monopoly game board.
   The crime rate also causes concern. In 1976, the Committee to
Rebuild Atlantic City promised that casino gaming would reduce
violent crime in the resort.
   Murders, rapes, assaults and armed robberies actually increased
from 10.3 per 1,000 residents in 1977 to a high of 32 in 1981. But
when adjusted to account for the millions of visitors and thousands
of non-resident employees, the figures settle down to an overall
reduced rate.
   State gaming regulators beam with pride at having kept the
casinos relatively free of organized crime's corruption, although
some critics feel they wield too much control over the city. Others
suggest Atlantic City needs more control _ specifically, a regional
or state authority to run city government. The current power
struggle among state, county and local officials has delayed two
important projects: a proposed new convention center and a larger
airport.
   ``The city itself has not redeveloped as quickly as everyone
hoped,'' said Casino Control Commissioner Valerie Armstrong.
``There was a great deal of optimism in 1976 when the referendum
passed that things would move quickly, but it's disappointing to
see what is potentially a beautiful city not go anywhere.''
   Atlantic City was languishing, the victim of broadening travel
horizons made possible by cheaper airfares, when the notion of
legalized gaming surfaced as a way to rebuild. A referendum to
legalize gambling statewide failed in 1974; a second ballot
question, limiting gaming to Atlantic City, was approved by New
Jersey voters Nov. 2, 1976.
   The casinos have generally found New Jersey profitable. But the
city never revitalized enough to improve its appearance beyond the
casinos.
   While the suburbs are booming with shopping centers and housing
developments, Atlantic City still has no movie theater that isn't
pornographic and only one well-worn supermarket. Houses on prime
waterfront lots are dilapidated, owned mostly by speculators who
hoped a decade ago _ and still hope _ to reap huge profits.
   And what development has taken place has not pleased everyone.
   The Rev. Dudley Sarfaty, an original member of the ``Casinos: No
Dice!'' anti-gambling group, still believes that ``a lot of the
local people gambling was supposed to save were driven away.''
   Others want to preserve the old Atlantic City of grand seaside
hotels, the Miss America Pageant, Boardwalk rolling chairs and
ocean breezes.
   ``The worst thing to happen to Atlantic City was perhaps the
failure to properly plan and protect the Boardwalk frontage
architecturally so there would have been something other than solid
masonry walls,'' said Atlantic County historian Adrian Phillips.
   In a similar vein, former Gov. Brendan Byrne, who ushered in
casino gambling, said Atlantic City needs to focus more attention
on becoming an overall resort instead of just a casino town.
   ``Atlantic City has contributed to the new, exciting image of
New Jersey as a state that's not just a turnpike between New York
and Washington,'' he said. ``But Atlantic City needs to become a
fun place to visit even if you're not going to a casino.''
   Ten years ago, local business owners believed they would profit
from the casinos next door. Most did not, primarily because the
casinos became self-contained cities.
   ``Competitors in the wagering business argued that it wasn't
safe for people to visit Atlantic City,'' said Norton of Resorts.
``But we found that as long as you could provide a safe, indoor
environment, we could create whatever atmosphere we wanted inside.''
   Despite the competition, some local businesses survived. Arnold
Orsatti, a restaurateur, said he discovered ``there's room for
everybody.''
   ``There are too many people who think negatively,'' he said.
``We're doing very well. A lot of the big spenders would rather go
outside of the casino than wait in line.''
   Cora Boggs, president of the Congress of Community
Organizations, recalled that ``too many people in Atlantic City,
including myself, were resentful for a long while of the casinos
because we couldn't see anything else happening.''
   But now that funds from the Casino Reinvestment Development
Authority are beginning to rebuild beleaguered neighborhoods, Mrs.
Boggs said, ``The attitude is changing.''
   Former Mayor Joseph Lazarow helped push through the gambling
proposal.
   ``I'm proud of what I've done,'' Lazarow said. ``There's a lot
more opportunity here now, a lot of decent jobs. Maybe they're not
all the best in the world, but a family can make a living here now.
   ``I think we revived a fast-dying city.''

   Actress Priscilla Presley says she's incensed
over reports that her ex-husband Elvis Presley is alive and in
seclusion.
   Such claims by ``supposedly reputable journalists,'' she said,
are nonsense and harmful to herself and 20-year-old daughter, Lisa
Marie, Elvis' only child.
   Miss Presley, who was married to Elvis from 1967 to 1972, said
Wednesday she was referring to KABC-TV's four-part series called
``Is Elvis Alive?''
   The report mentioned Atlanta author Gail Giorgio, whose book,
``The Most Incredible Elvis Presley Story Ever Told,'' purports the
King of Rock 'n' Roll may still be swinging. Ms. Giorgio claims she
has an audio tape of Elvis speaking in 1980.
   Presley died in 1977, four years after Priscilla Presley
divorced him.
   ``It infuriates me that certain journalists have decided to
exploit Elvis Presley's death merely for the sake of newspaper
sales and higher ratings,'' Miss Presley said.
   The Los Angeles station's news director, Terry Crofoot, said,
``It isn't KABC's claim that Elvis is alive. It would be ludicrous
for us to say that.''

   Ryan White doesn't have his driver's license
yet, but the 16-year-old AIDS victim happily accepted the keys to
his own car as he was honored for his ``ennobling'' courage.
   Ryan received the black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier from the Indiana
Independent Automobile Dealers Association on Wednesday.
   ``Ryan has shown that the ordinary things in life can be
ennobling. He has the kind of courage that I think most of us would
like to have,'' said the association's president, Fritz Kreutzinger.
   ``I just want to tell everybody thanks,'' Ryan said. When asked
what he planned to do with the car, he replied, ``Drive it. I'm
going to go anywhere and everywhere.''
   Ryan, who contracted AIDS through blood products used in the
treatment of his hemophilia, won a long legal battle to stay in
public school after officials in Kokomo banned him from classes in
1985.
   He has completed driver's education classes and plans to get his
license June 9.

   Ivana Trump may have already made her fortune in
the land of opportunity, but the transition from immigrant to U.S.
citizen wasn't complete until she stood before a judge with 141
other naturalized citizens.
   With her at Wednesday's ceremony was her husband, billionaire
developer Donald Trump, who listened as Judge Charles S. Haight Jr.
told the new citizens that ``by your presence, America is vastly
enriched.''
   ``I'm very proud of my wife,'' a beaming Trump said. ``I'm very

woman should be. Now they're both matched up perfectly.''
   Mrs. Trump, a 38-year-old Austrian-born, former Czechoslovakian

   Mother Teresa, the 77-year-old ``saint of

visit to a day center opened by her religious order to help victims
of the disease.
   ``The disease should not make us bitter or angry,'' said the
Yugoslav-born Roman Catholic nun and founder of the Missionaries of
Charity, which in October opened ``The Center'' in one of Oakland's
most crime-plagued neighborhoods.
   ``We must accept (AIDS) .... make use of it, not as a
punishment, but as a thing that gives us peace,'' she said during
the visit Wednesday.
   The center offers alternative healing, prayer groups, counseling
and some in-home care.
   Mother Teresa won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her worldwide
effort on behalf of the poor and rejected.

<TEXT>
   The first McDonald's to open in a
communist country has run into an unexpected problem: Trained
employees are quitting because they find they have to work like
Westerners and get paid like east Europeans.
   Since the American fast food chain opened its outlet in Belgrade
in March, 40 employees _ about one-third of its workers _ have
voluntarily left their jobs despite a high unemployment rate in
Yugoslavia.
   Predrag Dostanic, managing director of the restaurant, blames
illusions about the West gleaned from American movies shown on
Yugoslav TV for the dropout rate.
   ``That is all a result of a drastically incorrect concept about
international businesses, implanted in people's minds by such
American TV series as `Dynasty,''' Dostanic said.
   ``Those who have left us thought they would earn high wages only
by virtue of working for an American enterprise,'' said Vesna
Milosevic, an official of Genex, the Yugoslav state enterprise that
entered into a joint venture agreement with McDonald's.
   ``Those young people who quit probably also expected they could
do their jobs the Yugoslav way _ relax at work but still receive
wages,'' Dostanic added.
   According to a recent domestic survey, average Yugoslavs work
efficiently for only half of their eight-hour workday. The rest of
the time is spent reading newspapers, conducting private business
or having interminable private chats with collegues over coffee.
   The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, has drawn
huge crowds since it opened March 23 to post a European record for
McDonald's restaurants by selling an average 6,000 meals daily for
the first month of operation.
   The only other European branch matching the Belgrade record is
the McDonald's in Budapest, Hungary, which opened a month after the
Yugoslav outlet.
   With demand growing fast, it is serving about 6,000 people a
day. Employees are so overworked that store manager Agnes Rapalics
decided the only way to cope was to close at 8 p.m., three hours
early.
   Her decision swiftly prompted moans from Hungarians, including a
sour reader who wrote to the Magyar Hirlap newspaper asking, ``Does
every wonder only last three days?''
   When the McDonald's restaurant opened in Belgrade, police were
called in to keep watch on the lines of customers snaking around
the bloc and to limit the number of people entering the premises to
avoid overcrowding.
   ``The work was so hard that I could not stand it any more,''
said a former employee, who asked not to be identified. ``If my
salary was adequate to the work, I might have stayed.''
   The restaurant employees, mostly young people trained to work on
counters and in the kitchen, receive about $170 a month, which is
slightly above the Yugoslav average.
   ``We have no problem replacing those who have quit with new
staff, except that the newcomers have to get their training while
doing their work,'' said Milosevic.
   About 1.1 million people, or about 15 percent of the work force,
are registered as unemployed in Yugoslavia. In Belgrade alone,
about 80,000 are looking for jobs.
   ``Maybe there is something good in all these unexpected staff
problems,'' said Milosevic. ``Only the best workers will survive,''
she added.
   McDonald's and Genex contributed $1 million each for the
flagship restaurant. They also share the profits equally, even
though it is managed by Yugoslavs.
   The American corporation plans to open five more restaurants in
Yugoslavia in the next five years.

   Images of Michael Jackson dancing to rock music in
a Pepsi commercial flicker across the Soviet television screen, and
Levi's jeans hug the hips of young Russians in a crowded subway car.
   Amerika, as the Soviets call it, has arrived.
   ``Far behind the Iron Curtain, we were able to develop a
pro-Western mentality, and what, tell me, could be more Western
than America?'' emigre author Vasily Aksyonov wrote about his youth
in the Soviet Union of the 1950s.
   Even the Cyrillic alphabet hasn't prevented what the Russians
call Amerikanizatsia. ``Jeansi,'' ``stop,'' ``break dance,'' ``OK''
and one of the latest signs of the times _ ``stress'' _ are now
part of the Russian lexicon.
   Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev has
encouraged his people to learn more about America. To demonstrate
his sincerity, he has allowed more travel to the United States,
ended the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts and removed
barriers to joint business deals.
   In April, a record 1,200 Soviets, most of them Jews, were
allowed to visit relatives in the United States. An additional
1,000 Soviets traveled there on official business. Before
Gorbachev, only a handful of Soviets visited the United States
monthly.
   The 1985 Geneva summit gave an official stamp of approval to
cultural agreements and ``people-to-people'' exchanges. Under the
agreements, Soviet and American lawyers, doctors, students,
musicians, scientists and teachers have visited each other.
   In some instances, the exchanges reflect a Soviet desire for
American help in tackling social problems such as alcoholism and
drug addiction, problems the government previously denied existed.
   At the grass-roots level, Soviets need little encouragement to
talk about things American.
   When introduced to an American, many Soviets immediately start
with the questions, on everything from war and peace to the
availability of hamburgers.
   A taxi driver's reaction when a passenger introduced himself as
an American was to run down the American authors she loved _ Ernest
Hemingway, Mark Twain, Ray Bradbury. Collections of these authors
in translation occupy prominent places on the bookshelves in some
Soviet apartments. More contemporary American authors are lesser
known because their works still aren't available in the Soviet
Union.
   Levi's jeans are required attire in certain circles. And some of
those who manage to get an American candy bar, soft drink or pack
of cigarettes proudly display the empty packaging in their living
rooms.
   Many Soviets are turning to videotapes for a glimpse of America.
Tapes of movies such as ``Police Academy'' and ``Rambo,'' dubbed in
Russian, are passed among friends in a thriving black market where
blank cassettes cost at least 50 rubles ($80), or one quarter of an
average monthly salary.
   The black market also feeds on young Soviets' thirst for
American rock music. Records of Madonna and Michael Jackson fetch
exorbitant sums. Jackson's music videos have appeared on Soviet
television, and his Pepsi commercials hit the airwaves in mid-May
during broadcast of a five-part series on the United States.
   Officially sponsored concerts by American musicians such as
Billy Joel, Dave Brubeck and the Doobie Brothers have become major
happenings.
   At the same time, some Soviet rock stars are traveling to the
United States. Boris Grebenshchikov, the hippy-like leader of the
Leningrad rock band Aquarium, is scheduled to record an album in
the United States this summer.
   The end of Soviet jamming of Voice of America broadcasts in May
1987 opened a new source of information about life in the United
States.
   Satellite television discussions with American studio audiences
also have given Soviets a chance to learn first-hand about life in
the United States. Soviet television's widely watched evening news
program ``Vremya'' has shown features on child care, automobiles
and sports in America, and in mid-May Soviet television broadcast a
series moderated by former U.S. resident Vladimir Posner.
   But even though Soviet media coverage about the United States
has become more balanced under Gorbachev, reports about crime,
unemployment, racism and the poor are still common.
   In politics, Americans and Soviets still have sharp differences.
But for many of the Soviets who viewed Reagan as a warmonger a few
years ago the rhetoric has eased since he signed an agreement with
Gorbachev last December to eliminate all medium-range nuclear
missiles.
   ``We have no propaganda of hatred toward Americans, no
disrespect of Americans,'' Gorbachev told a group of U.S. teachers
of Russian who met with him at the Kremlin last August. ``One
cannot find them here, either in politics or in teaching.''

   It's been more than 300 years since this
town saw so much struggle over restraint, but Plimoth Plantation
visitors could soon be drinking beer and wine after a brief spell
of temperance at the tourist spot.
   For a while, it looked like the prudish reputation of those
early settlers had come back to haunt the village, which offers a
glimpse of 17th century life after Plymouth Rock. But Tuesday
night, after several go-rounds, the Board of Selectmen approved a
limited liquor license for the plantation.
   The board twice rejected requests for a license to serve all
types of liquor year-round or for one-day licenses.
   The license approved Tuesday applies only from April to
November, when the plantation visitor center is open. It still
requires state approval.
   The 41-year-old private, non-profit tourist spot first served
alcohol four years ago at a snack bar. But that license was
discontinued when the snack bar was torn down.
   With the opening of a new visitors center and 200-seat
restaurant, the plantation management hoped to draw more business
by opening in the off-hours for business conferences, during which
guests would expect alcohol on the menu.
   In the past, some residents objected that alcohol was not in
keeping with the Pilgrim spirit.
   But in fact, the Pilgrims cooked with wine and regarded beer as
more healthful than water, plantation officials said.
   However, plantation spokeswoman Sarah Mann said most of the
arguments against a comprehensive liquor license came from nearby
restaurants and bars.

   The state Senate agreed with the saying,
``you can't take it with you,'' and approved a bill that would
allow elderly lottery winners to receive their jackpots sooner than
younger winners.
   The bill approved Wednesday and sent to the Assembly would allow
jackpot winners older than age 65 to take their earnings in one
lump sum or in periodic payments during their expected lifetime.
   ``The usual 20-year payoff on a lottery prize will not always
result in a total benefit to the winner who is over 65, as he may
not live to receive the full benefit,'' said a memo on the bill.
   ``The fact that the unpaid balance would be paid to his estate
is of little consolation to many elderly winners who may wish to
fully enjoy the fruits of their good fortune,'' it said.
   But John Quinn, director of the state Lottery Division, said he
opposes the bill because it would substantially reduce jackpots.
   For example, he said, the jackpot up for grabs Wednesday was $3
million, but ``I don't have $3 million to give them, I have $1.4
million. The difference is interest money.''
   A winner currently would receive 21 annual payments of $114,000
after taxes, said Quinn. If someone opted to take the prize in a
$1.4 million lump sum, they would owe about $580,000 in taxes, he
said.
   Quinn said he didn't believe any state lotteries offer the
lump-sum option.
   The average million-dollar lottery winner in New York is 49
years old, said Quinn.

   There are no traffic lights in all of
peaceful Trinity County _ and it's going to stay that way, despite
a state suggestion one is needed near a proposed shopping center.
   When an environmental impact report was prepared for a
140,000-square-foot mall east of Weaverville, the state Department
of Transportation said it ``would have some definite traffic
impacts,'' and suggested that ``the future need for a traffic
signal should be considered at this time.''
   But that's not how the Northern California county sees it.
   In fact, says Tom Miller, county director of planning and public
works, the lack of traffic lights ``is a source of local pride.''
   The county adopted a regional study in 1986 that makes the
feelings of its 12,500 residents clear: No traffic signals and no
widening of Highway 299, the main drag through Weaverville, the
county seat.

<HEAD>Three Israeli Workers Killed In Ship Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Israeli longshoremen were killed and one
was badly injured by poisonous gas in the hull of a Belgian coal
ship they were cleaning in Hadera port, Israel Television said.
   The Energy Ministry named a commission of inquiry to investigate
the accident on Wednesday aboard the vessel Orinocco Antwerpen, it
said.
   The vessel had been docked at Hadera, 30 miles north of Tel
Aviv, since Sunday to unload its cargo of Australian coal.
   The dock workers were descending into one of the nine storage
tanks to prepare it for reloading.
   ``The door was open and one went down. We didn't hear him from
the top so a second went down. After him a third, a fourth. Finally
the fifth realized something was wrong and alerted the ship's
crew,'' Uri Binder, manager of the cleaning company, told Israel
Television.
   It was not immediately clear what type of gas was involved or
where it came from.

<HEAD>Entertainer's Leopard Escapes And Kills 2-Year-Old Daughter</HEAD>

   A leopard owned by a rock singer who
uses animals in his nightclub act escaped from its cage Wednesday
and killed the entertainer's 2-year-old daughter, officials said.
   Five leopards escaped from Joe Savage's home on 200 acres near
Ashland City, but all were captured by Wednesday night, said police
Lt. Jim Blackmore.
   Nikka Savage, mauled in her family's front yard, died at
Vanderbilt Medical Center as a result of blood loss and massive
injuries to her head and neck, said hospital spokeswoman Nancy
Humphrey.
   The leopard involved in the attack was tranquilized by wildlife
officials, and died while being transported away, Metro Nashville
police said.
   Savage, who performs heavy metal rock music in leather and wild
make-up, uses the leopards in his nightclub act. Savage was in Las
Vegas, Nev., but police said he was on his way back to Nashville
after being informed of the attack.
   A police helicopter, a professional wildcat handler and about 40
police officers joined in the search before the last escaped
animal, a 40-pound black leopard, was captured Wednesday night.
   Earlier, Police Chief Joe Casey urged parents to keep their
children indoors, saying, ``They tell us it's not dangerous but
they said that about the animal that killed the little girl.''
   Savage was treated at a Nashville hospital in 1984 after a boa
constrictor choked him during an act in which he wrapped snakes
around his neck.

   If the white satellite dishes pointing west from
the Rossiya Hotel past the Kremlin's ancient church domes didn't
indicate something unusual was going on, the new paint and pavement
along Vorovsky Street might.
   Moscow is being inundated with American officials and Western
correspondents bringing the latest technology to cover President
Reagan's five-day visit, beginning Sunday.
   And in age-old tradition, officials are painting, paving and
otherwise sprucing up to ensure that Reagan and those accompanying
him get the best possible view of the Soviet capital.
   Reagan left Washington on Wednesday for a three-night stopover
in Helsinki, Finland, before flying to the Soviet Union for his
summit with Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He comes to Moscow at a time when the city traditionally is
trying to right itself after another long, cold winter. The truck
traffic that roars along the Garden Ring Road slows to a crawl as
workers fill another spring crop of potholes, and scaffolding goes
up on buildings everywhere.
   Red tulips planted in squares and along boulevards are in bloom,
as are the lilacs bordering sidewalks and apartment buildings
around the city. Stately chestnut trees are in bloom on the Kremlin
lawns. The sun rises about 5 a.m. and doesn't set until almost 10
p.m., leaving a purple glow in the sky until almost midnight.
   But this year the spring cleaning has taken on a particularly
urgent air around several of the places Reagan will visit.
   The short street leading from the Garden Ring Road to Spaso
House, the U.S. ambassador's residence where Reagan will stay, has
been repaired for the first time in years. Pavement torn out months
ago has been replaced, and almost all the barricades that narrowed
traffic for two blocks have been removed.
   Vorovsky Street also is undergoing a major facelift. Nearly
every building along the street from the Writers Union, which
Reagan is scheduled to visit, to the Soviet Supreme Court building
several blocks away appears to have been given a new coat of paint.
   The Foreign Ministry press center, where Moscow's most important
press conferences are held, has been undergoing repairs for weeks
to improve the seats and the acoustics.
   Officials promised last week that it would be finished in time
for the summit, and a pre-summit news conference was held there
this week. When a reporter asked one of the speakers for a specific
example of changes wrought by Gorbachev's reforms, however, the
microphones and armchair earphones installed for simultaneous
translation suddenly failed, forcing a premature end to the session.
   The Tass news agency said newspapers and magazines from around
the world will be available at the press center next week, not just
the usual selection of papers from the Soviet bloc.
   At the U.S. Embassy, some last-minute painting was going on, and
workers cleared out the courtyard in front of the empty chancery in
the new red-brick compound. The building has been the source of
dispute between the United States and Soviet Union since U.S.
officials discovered that it was honeycombed with Soviet listening
devices. It never has been put into use.
   At stores, Soviet citizens said they had noticed no increases in
supplies to cut down on the lines that gather in the streets. One
young woman joked that closer to Reagan's arrival, ``maybe they'll
even bring out sugar'' which has been in short supply in the
capital and rationed elsewhere in the country because of
moonshining, hoarding and price increase.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said in an
interview with the newspaper Vechernaya Moskva that about 3,000
foreign journalists are expected for the summit, half from print
media and half from radio and television.
   Gerasimov said the Ministry of Communications could not handle
the demands of the Western television companies, so they wre
permitted to bring in satellite dishes and other sophisticated
equipment normally under strict government control.
   The American television networks have crammed room after room of
the mammoth Rossiya Hotel with shiny silver equipment cases,
preparing to broadcast their evening news programs from the Soviet
capital.
   With some 5,000 Soviet and foreign journalists accredited to
cover the event, the summit press corps is the largest to gather
here since the 1980 Olympics, Soviet officials say.
   Moscow dissidents say they have noticed another similarity
between the two events: Many deemed ``undesirable'' by the
authorities were forced to leave town. Eight years ago, they
included prostitutes, speculators and other criminals, as well as
dissidents.
   Father Valery Lapkovsky, a Russian Orthodox priest from the
Crimean city of Kerch, arrived in Moscow last Friday and was told
by authorities the next day to leave, said Russian Orthodox
activist Alexander Ogorodnikov.
   Lapkovsky was put into a mental hospital and diagnosed as
schizophrenic in 1966 after approaching the U.S. Embassy with an
appeal to then-President Lyndon B. Johnson to help him leave the
Soviet Union.
   Soviet officials also have set up roadblocks at the edge of the
city to inspect automobiles. The aim is to keep down the number of
broken-down cars on the streets of Moscow during the Reagan visit.

<HEAD>High School Dropout Ends Up As Valedictorian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school dropout who saw two of her
sons quit school as teen-agers has graduated from college with
straight A's.
   Janet Johnson, 43, of Wheaton, earned a perfect 4.0 grade
average and was valedictorian at Tuesday's commencement for the
School of Education at the University of Maryland.
   ``I can't come down yet. It's the highest point of my life so
far,'' she said Wednesday.
   She had quit high school at age 16 to get married and have a
family. Years later, she earned a high school equivalency degree.
   Mrs. Johnson had worked as a teacher's aide and secretary before
deciding it wasn't too late to try for a college degree in
elementary education. She received an associate's degree after
attending night classes at Montgomery College in Rockville for
three years.
   ``When I went to the University of Maryland, I won a $5,000
scholarship and all these wonderful things started happening,'' she
said. ``It's been fabulous.''
   In her graduation address, she thanked her fellow students for
including her in activities and treating her as one of them.
   ``They'd say, `Come on, Janet, we're going to have something to
eat together.' They wanted me to go. That felt good. They didn't
make me feel different.''
   Her two older children, ages 25 and 26, dropped out of high
school but also received high school equivalency degrees. Her third
son is 15. Her husband retired with a disability after working as a
firefighter. She also has a young grandchild.
   ``It was a struggle without my income for the past two years,
but we said, `We can do it' and we did,'' she said. ``It was hard
especially with the family. There were things I couldn't do for the
children that I wanted to.''
   Mrs. Johnson hopes her scholastic success will motivate her
youngest son to try harder in school.
   ``It did seem to have an effect on him. I really want him to
continue his education,'' she said.
   Mrs. Johnson has a contract with the Montgomery County school
system to teach in an elementary school this fall. She is now
working as a substitute teacher at Head Start.
   ``I put a lot of effort into it, and worked a little harder,''
she said. ``Being a little bit older and just living, you learn.
And I didn't have to worry about toga parties and sororities.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Eisenhower Like Reagan Sought Arms Pact as Final
Legacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president, nearing the end of his eight
years in office, hoped to leave an arms accord as his final legacy
after a summit meeting with the leader of the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet leader, under attack by conservatives in his own
country for reforms he was attempting, responded sharply to what he
described as confrontational statements from Washington.
   The year was 1960. The president was Dwight D. Eisenhower. The
Soviet leader was Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   The summit ended in failure.
   There are some obvious differences between that summit and next
week's meeting between President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   What wrecked the 1960 summit, or at least contributed to its
collapse, was the furor that arose after an American U-2 spy plane
was forced down in the Soviet Union and its pilot was captured.
   There is nothing like that on the horizon now, although the
Soviets are as adamant against Reagan's Star Wars missile defense
system as they were against Eisenhower's ``open skies'' plan to
give the superpowers access to each other's air space.
   Still, the resemblances are haunting.
   Eisenhower, hoping for a comprehensive ban on all nuclear
testing, told French President Charles de Gaulle, ``What a splendid
exit it would be for me to end up ... with an agreement between
East and West.'' Reagan hopes for a pact by the end of his term to
curb the intercontinental ballistic missiles that have flourished
since Eisenhower's day.
   Khrushchev, who had unmasked the excesses of Joseph Stalin in
his landmark ``secret speech,'' was making modest economic and
political reforms in the Soviet Union and urging dialogue with the
United States. Similarly, Gorbachev has pushed his policies of
``glasnost,'' or openness, and ``perestroika,'' or reconstruction.
   ``My father was the first to `shake' the Soviet bureaucratic
society,'' Khrushchev's son, Sergei, told the Yugoslav daily
Vjesnik in an interview published this month. ``I hope Mikhail
Gorbachev succeeds where my father did not.''
   Like Khrushchev's, the reforms initiated by Gorbachev appear to
have encountered resistance from the old guard in the Kremlin.
   Both Soviet leaders reacted sharply to statements by their U.S.
counterparts.
   After Eisenhower acknowledged the U-2 flights, Khrushchev said
the U.S. president appeared to be ``boasting arrogantly about what
the United States could do and would do'' and demonstrating that
the Americans ``didn't give a damn about anyone else, that they
would pursue only their selfish goals.''
   And when Reagan accused the Soviets of continued expansionism
abroad and repression at home in a speech in Springfield, Mass.,
last month, Gorbachev responded, ``We have so far been showing
restraint, but if we reciprocate _ and we can do so over a wide
range of issues _ the atmosphere in Soviet-American relations can
become such that it will make it no longer possible to solve any
further issues.''
   Some observers have interpreted Gorbachev's remarks as a
deliberate display of toughness designed for Soviet as well as
American audiences.
   ``Quite possibly there are people around him in Moscow who don't
like the many concessions he has made to the United States,'' said
Vladimir Petrov, professor emeritus of international affairs at
George Washington University.
   In 1960, too, some suspected the Soviet leader's blustering was
an attempt to bolster his strength at home.
   Retired Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, a top aide to Eisenhower, said,
``I do recall that we thought at the time that he might just be
vulnerable because of meeting with Eisenhower and the favorable
attitude he had toward Eisenhower and this might have put him in
some danger and put him under some pressure in the Soviet Union.''
   The arms control issue, as well as the status of Berlin, had
been on the agenda for a four-power summit meeting _ the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France _ in Paris on May 16.
   It broke up in disaster. Khrushchev, pounding a table so hard he
upset a bottle of mineral water, denounced the U-2 flights and
``the lackeys of imperialism.''
   He also withdrew his invitation to Eisenhower to visit the
Soviet Union the following month.
   Eisenhower, disappointed in his hopes for an East-West
agreement, later said he might have been ``lulled into
overconfidence.''

<HEAD>Passenger Jets Came Within 300 Feet Of Each Other</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators are trying to determine why two
jetliners flying in opposite directions with 286 people on board
were assigned the same altitude, bringing them within 300 feet of
colliding head-on over the ocean north of Puerto Rico.
   The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the Monday evening
incident, which involved a Pan American World Airways Airbus-300
and an American Airlines Boeing 727.
   Both pilots said in near-collision reports that they had no time
to take evasive action as the two aircraft passed wing tip to wing
tip in clear weather about 550 miles north of Puerto Rico in the
so-called Bermuda Triangle.
   The triangle is a region in the Atlantic Ocean where ships and
aircraft are reputed to have disappeared since the 1940s.
   The jets both were believed to be cruising at better than 500
miles an hour with a closing speed of more than 1,000 miles an
hour. Neither pilot reported seeing the aircraft until they were
about to pass each other.
   ``It is being investigated as a possible operational error'' by
air traffic controllers, FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said Wednesday,
when the incident was revealed. He said he did not know whether the
controllers involved have been removed from directing aircraft,
normally the case in such an incident.
   In addition to the FAA investigation, the National
Transportation Safety Board has sent a team of investigators to
Puerto Rico to talk to the controllers involved.
   Farrar confirmed that both of the jetliners were assigned to
29,000 feet and were under the control of the San Juan air traffic
control center at the time of the incident.
   That section of airspace is beyond FAA radar, so separation is
maintained by assigning specific altitudes. Normal separation would
be at least 1,000 feet vertically between aircraft and possibly
more in some areas, according to Farrar.
   He said that in oceanic airspace where there is no radar
tracking planes there also is supposed to be ``substantial''
horizontal separation well beyond the five-mile minimum in
radar-controlled airspace.
   ``These planes should not both have been at 29,000 feet,''
Farrar said.
   He said the two jetliners had about 300 feet horizontal
separation and that ``both aircraft observed each other as they
passed.''
   The incident involved Pan Am Flight 217, which was southbound
from New York to Caracas, Venezuela, with a later stop at Trinidad.
The plane carried 131 passengers and 10 crew members, according to
Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon.
   The other plane was American Flight 902 which was northbound
from San Juan on a flight to Philadelphia. The Boeing 727 carried
138 passengers and seven crewmembers, said John Hotard, a spokesman
for American Airlines.
   ``We understand it's an operational error by air traffic
control. It's our understanding that (both airplanes) were assigned
to 29,000 feet,'' said Hotard in a telephone interview.
   Farrar said the FAA is investigating who gave the planes their
altitude. Both planes were under San Juan air traffic control's
direction, he said.
   Another source, who asked not to be identified by name, said
that the incident occurred near where control of planes switches
from the FAA center in New York to the San Juan center and the
handoff may have resulted in an altitude mixup.
   The FAA's Farrar said he could not confirm that.
   Investigators for the NTSB flew to San Juan on Wednesday to
interview the controllers and may also speak later to the pilots
involved, said spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   ``We are investigating the incident. We're looking into it,''
Lopatkiewicz said.

   In the end, it seemed almost everybody,
ranging from Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to his severest U.S.
critics, was saying the same thing about the administration's
proposed deal for Panama: ``Just Say No.''
   Vice President George Bush opposed it along with 86 members of
the Senate. Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of the anti-Noriega
forces here, said the plan would enable the ``criminal empire''
Noriega created to survive the temporary exile planned for him.
   A disgruntled administration official was embittered by the
terms the administration was offering for Noriega's departure:
``His mother could have written it,'' he said.
   Noriega disagreed. Just when an agreement appeared to be within
reach Wednesday, he could not bring himself to approve it.
   Critics of the plan are delighted but Wednesday's drama,
bringing an end to almost a month of intense negotiations, puts the
United States and Panama back to square one.
   Justice Department officials, who all along opposed the lifting
of drug smuggling indictments against Noriega, are pleased with the
outcome. But there is virtually no prospect that Noriega will ever
be prosecuted.
   The administration has withdrawn all its proposals from the
bargaining table and is left with few ideas on what to do next
beyond sounding out Latin American democracies on their thoughts.
   The negotiations ended almost three months to the hour after
Panama's crisis began with the failed attempt by President Eric
Arturo Delvalle to fire Noriega.
   Delvalle, who was fired himself the next day, remains in hiding,
portraying himself as Panama's legitimate president but without the
means to exercise power and with little hope of being able to do so.
   In 1903, when U.S. power in the hemisphere was unquestioned,
President Theodore Roosevelt arranged for the secession of Panama
from Colombia and for perpetual U.S. control over 10-mile wide
``canal zone.'' Those feats took all of two weeks.
   While the United States was once able to get Panama to leave
Colombia, it now is unable to perform a task seemingly much
simpler: getting Noriega to leave Panama.
   Privately, U.S. officials describe the administration's Central
America policy as in a shambles. Coupled with the collapse of the
Panama negotiations is the prospect of disintegration of the
Nicaraguan Contras and the consolidation of Sandinista rule.
   Initially, Delvalle's attempt to fire Noriega seemed to offer
the administration a rare opportunity. Panama's public opinion had
galvanized against Noriega, a general strike against his rule was
surprisingly successful and it seemed logical that a judicious
display of U.S. pressure would be enough to topple him.
   To many, the administration was in a position to strike a blow
for democracy in Panama and against an indicted drug dealer and to
achieve a badly needed victory in Central America after
congressional rejection of more Contra aid.
   Noriega's base of support seemed limited to a small coterie of
allies in Panama's Defense Forces and isolated segments of Panama's
peasantry.
   But Noriega proved to be extraordinarily resilient, sensing
correctly that as long as the Defense Forces remained loyal, he
stayed.
   He was not about to give up, nor about to repeat the humiliating
surrender of his countryman, Roberto Duran, who scandalized
Panamanians in the seventh round of a 1980 fight with Sugar Ray
Leonard when he walked, head down, to his corner and said ``No
mas.''
   Shultz echoed the spirit of Duran's famous remark on Wednesday
although in a far different context when he discussed the collapse
of the talks with Noriega.
   ``No further negotiations are contemplated,'' Shultz said. ``All
proposals addressed during these negotiations have been withdrawn.
No offers remain on the table.''

   Two monasteries have been returned to Armenian
church officials by the government, the Tass news agency said.
   The official news agency said on Wednesday that Armenian
authorities returned to the church the Tateva monastery, built in
the 9th century, and the Makaravank monastery, built between the
11th and 13th centuries.
   The government in Armenia, a southern Soviet republic that
borders Turkey, also returned three mosques to religious officials,
Tass said.
   It quoted Patriarch-Catholicos Vazgen of the Armenian church as
saying the return of the facilities was an example of improved
church-state relations.
   Tass said the monasteries had been under state protection for
many years, but provided no other details about them.

   David Letterman could get back on the air and
Johnny Carson would have his writers back under agreements both
have reached with the striking Writers Guild of America, the
union's president said Wednesday as talks resumed in the
12-week-old strike.
   Carson, whose ``Tonight Show'' resumed production this month
when he began writing his own monologue, has signed an independent
contract and Letterman, whose ``Late Night'' is still in reruns,
has agreed to sign, said Guild President George Kirgo.
   Kirgo said he was confident that the union membership would
approve the three-year pacts with the producers of the two shows.
Guild members were scheduled to vote Thursday night on the
independent contracts, which executive director Brian Walton said
involved 39 companies as of Wednesday afternoon.
   The start of the fall television season could hang in the
balance as the striking scriptwriters and producers conduct
last-chance talks. The strike began March 7.
   Walton and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers said the producers presented several proposals Wednesday,
and while the union left some open for discussion, it immediately
rejected a new payment structure for one-hour prime-time television
shows sold into syndication.
   The formula would drop a fixed payment schedule and reward
writers based on a show's success in syndication.
   Earlier Wednesday, Letterman issued a tongue-in-cheek statement
through NBC saying his manager and lawyer _ and U.S. Attorney
General Ed Meese _ were negotiating with the Guild. Apparently
seriously, though, he said he hoped to be back on the air, with his
writers back at their jobs, as early as June 8. ``In the meantime,
I am keeping busy with my gardening and phoning my favorite
talk-radio programs,'' he joked in the statement. ``Last month, I
splurged and treated myself to much-needed liposuction surgery on
my hips and thighs.''
   ``I talked to David last week,'' said Kirgo. ``He's waiting. He
will not go back to work without his writers. We had a long and
terrific talk.''
   Nearly 100 negotiators, attorneys and onlookers for the striking
Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers were on hand at the alliance's Sherman Oaks
headquarters for the second mediated session in three days.
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said there had been some ``new
thinking'' as a result of Monday's meeting with a mediator. Asked
what areas the new thinking included, Steinberg replied, ``the key
issues.''
   Kirgo did not share Steinberg's enthusiasm over a possible break
in the deadlock. ``We were here eight hours Monday and nothing
happened,'' he said.
   Producers are preparing to begin important talks June 15 with
the Hollywood craft unions and Teamsters, whose contracts expire
July 31.
   If writers are still negotiating by then, talks would have to be
scheduled around the other unions' talks.
   Both sides have suffered from the walkout over creative control
on the set and residual payments for both one-hour syndicated
television show reruns and works distributed in foreign countries.

   British doctors should in some cases inform the
sexual partners of AIDS patients that they are in danger, even if
the patient does not consent to the disclosure, the body
controlling British doctors said.
   In guidance which will be given to all doctors, the General
Medical Council also said on Wednesday that doctors may test
children for AIDS without their parents' consent in some cases.
   The 130-year-old council controls the education, registration
and disciplining of members of the medical profession in Britain.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the body's natural
immunity to infections and certain cancers and is invariably fatal.

<HEAD>Defendants in Capitol Bombing Protest Security, Jail Conditions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six radical leftists complained in lengthy
speeches about tight security and harsh jail conditions as they
were arraigned on charges of setting off a bomb in the the U.S.
Capitol five years ago.
   ``The security concerns have totally subordinated our legal
rights and our human rights,'' defendant Alan Berkman said
Wednesday.
   Berkman, a physician who already is serving 12 years for illegal
possession of explosives and weapons, then referred to the wall of
bulletproof plastic that separated the court from spectators and
said, ``There is no legitimate security concern to account for that
Plexiglas screen in the courtoom.''
   Lead defense counsel Susan Tipograph complained that the
defendants had been unable to meet privately with lawyers to confer
about the case. She also said that the defendants were forced to
wear handcuffs and leg irons while meeting with lawyers.
   She refused to discuss a schedule for pretrial motions until the
defendants had a chance to meet and discuss hiring permanent
lawyers for the case.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said that he would make
sure the defendants were allowed to meet together and confer
without being overheard by jail guards.
   But Greene said he would not interfere with other security
precautions taken against the defendants, who were already in
custody on other charges before the indictment was unsealed on May
11.
   The judge, who gave the defendants 30 days to hire lawyers,
expressed frustration with the lengthy speeches.
   ``We're not going to have a mass meeting,'' Greene said. ``If
you want to give vent to your exasperation, I can't help that.''
   At one point, Greene said: ``I'm getting sick of this.''
   Each of the six defendants pleaded innocent to the charges,
identifying themselves as ``anti-imperialist'' political prisoners.
   Marilyn Buck, Linda Sue Evans and Laura Whitehorn are charged
with conspiring to set off bombs in the Capitol and seven other
locations in New York City and Washington as part of a campaign of
``armed propaganda'' against U.S. foreign policy.
   They are charged along with Berkman, Timothy Blunk, Susan
Rosenberg and Elizabeth Duke, a fugitive, with malicious
destruction of property in connection with the bombings at the
Capitol and three military buildings in Washington in 1983 and 1984.
   None of the blasts caused any injuries.
   The Nov. 7, 1983, explosion outside the Senate chamber blew the
doors off hinges outside the offices of Senate Democratic Leader
Robert Byrd of West Virginia, damaged five paintings and knocked
down a wall.
   ``I am a political prisoner, not a terrorist,'' said Buck, 40,
who faces a life sentence following her conviction in New York
earlier this month of participating in two 1981 Brink's armored car
robberies that left four people dead.
   The indictment charges that the defendants are members of a
secret communist organization that plotted ``to oppose, obstruct or
change the foreign and domestic policies of the U.S. government
through violent and illegal means.''
   Five of the six defendants in court Wednesday already are
serving sentences for various federal weapons charges. Whitehorn
recently completed a two-year term for making a false statement on
a passport application. She is in custody awaiting trial in
Baltimore on federal weapons charges.
   Greene ordered her held without bail after Assistant U.S.
Attorney Margaret Ellen described how Whitehorn hit an FBI agent
while resisting arrest in Baltimore in 1985.
   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, relatives of the defendants issued
a statement accusing the goverment of trying to silence dissent.
``The Justice Department and the FBI are making a spectacle of this
case to show what the government will do if you dare to oppose
it,'' the group said in a statement.
   Dr. Barbara Zeller, Berkman's wife, said the courtroom security
was ``an enormous show of power of the U.S. government. They are
trying to intimidate serious dissent. They are trying to intimidate
the defendants.''
   Bella Rosenberg said that she was shocked to learn that her
daughter was being held in a psychiatric observation unit at the
District of Columbia Jail.
   ``There has never been any question about her mental or
emotional stability,'' Mrs. Rosenberg said. ``She has always been a
model prisoner.''
   Susan Rosenberg, 32, and Blunk, 30, are serving 58-year
sentences for possession of 600 pounds of explosives found when
they were arrested in Cherry Hill, N.J., nearly three years ago.
   The indictment charged that after each bombing, the defendants
claimed credit for the blasts under the names of various groups
such as the Armed Resistance Unit, the Revolutionary Fighting Group
and the Red Guerrilla Resistance.
   The groups also claimed responsibility for bombs set off at four
locations in New York City between 1983 and 1985, the indictment
charged.
   The blasts were set to protest various U.S. foreign policies
toward the Middle East and Central America.

<HEAD>Catastrophic Health Insurance Bill Clears Major Congressional
Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A catastrophic health insurance bill providing
the largest expansion of Medicare in the program's 23-year history
has cleared a major legislative hurdle.
   The compromise agreed to late Wednesday by a House-Senate
conference committee must win final approval from both chambers,
but that is a foregone conclusion given the broad support that the
basic measure received last year when it cleared the two houses in
different versions.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen told
conference committee members that he will recommend that President
Reagan sign the legislation, even though it is considerably more
ambitious than the measure proposed by the administration more than
a year ago.
   The basic framework of the legislation has been in place for
months: providing protection for America's 31 million Medicare
recipients against runaway hospital and prescription drug bills
accumulated during acute illnesses. But House and Senate
negotiators have worked since February to iron out the details.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, whose Finance Committee shaped the
Senate bill, called the compromise ``a landmark piece of
legislation ... that will bring peace of mind to millions.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee as well as the conference committee, praised Bowen
for his protracted role in overcoming some objections within the
administration to win presidential support for the Medicare
expansion.
   ``You are the linchpin who launched us on this crusade,''
Rostenkowski told Bowen, a physician and former two-term governor
of Indiana whose first wife died after a long battle against cancer.
   Bowen made catastrophic health legislation his top priority when
he was appointed to head the Health and Human Services Department a
little more than two years ago and was there when the final
compromise was struck.
   In fact, it was a surprise Bowen maneuver _ dropping his
opposition to a respite care provision for home-bound beneficaries
_ that removed the last stumbling block to compromise.
   Bentsen couldn't believe his ears when Bowen offered the
compromise.
   ``That's a hell of a deal,'' the Texan exclaimed. Later, he told
Bowen: ``You're timing was excellent. You are a great negotiator.''
   The big knot that had kept the legislation tied up was loosened
last week when a conference committee task force agreed on
provisions of a historic outpatient prescription drug benefit.
   The compromise legislation provides for Medicare coverage for
hospital stays lasting up to 364 days; a first-day deductible still
will be charged. Medicare now pays full hospital bills for only 59
days a year.
   Regarding doctor bills, Medicare now pays no more than 80
percent of approved charges, no matter how high they run. Under the
catastrophic health provision, Medicare will pay 100 percent of
allowable fees after an individual has incurred $1,320 to $1,400 in
out-of-pocket expenses.
   The exact level of that deductible has yet to be determined,
along with several other details such as the precise additional
premiums that will be assessed to pay for the new program.
   As for prescription drugs, Medicare now covers just a handful of
particularly expensive drugs, such as anti-rejection medication for
organ transplant patients.
   Under the expansion, Medicare will pay half of drug costs in
1991 after a $600 deductible is met, with the government share
rising to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in 1993. However, the
deductible is expected to rise each year to keep pace with rising
drug costs.
   The drug benefit, and all other additional benefits are to be
paid for by additional charges to Medicare enrollees. The charges
will be a blend of flat monthly premium increases deducted from
Social Security checks and an additional, sliding-scale
supplemental premium that will be charged to the estimated 40
percent of the elderly with enough income to make them subject to
federal income taxes.
   While the exact premiums have not yet been determined, the
additional flat premium will start at about $4 a month in 1989,
climbing to $10.20 in 1993.
   The so-called supplemental premium is expected to total an
additional $22 a year for each $150 of income tax owed in 1989,
climbing to an additional $42 a year on each $150 of tax liability
by 1993.
   In addition to the main provisions, the bill would add Medicare
benefits to hospice care and skilled nursing care. It also makes
changes in Medicaid to prevent the impoverishment of a spouse when
his or her mate must go into a nursing home. It also will require
state Medicaid programs to pay all Medicare premiums and
deductibles for elderly and disabled people with incomes below the
poverty line.

   Charles Scott has been through two wars, several
jobs and a lot of ups and downs.Now, he said, ``I'm 57 and I feel
like I'm 27.''
   Scott is about to graduate from the Vietnam Veterans Leadership
Program, which was started by the kind of veterans rarely heard
from _ well-adjusted, well-off and relatively untroubled by their
war experience.
   ``It's successful vets helping vets who haven't quite made it in
the mainstream,'' said the program's 44-year-old president and
co-founder, Gene Gitelson, who led an infantry platoon in Vietnam
in 1966 and 1967 as an Army first lieutenant.
   Among its founders, board members and staffers are lawyers,
investment bankers and executives of every pinstripe. The chairman
of the board, Doug Greenlaw, earned a Silver Star in Vietnam and is
an executive with MTV.
   Gitelson, a former banker and management consultant, started the
program six years ago in his apartment.
   ``We kept each other alive in Vietnam, with this enormous buddy
network. And now, 20 years later, we're rebuilding a network and
helping each other in an economic war, to get into the
mainstream,'' he said.
   Today, in a ceremony at Vietnam Veterans Plaza here, the
non-profit group is celebrating its move to a 10,000-square-foot
office, courtesy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and the donation
of $100,000 worth of computer equipment from IBM.
   About 750 veterans have been placed in jobs through the program,
which is a pilot for similiar efforts in other cities, Gitelson
said.
   Gitelson heads a staff of 24, most of them Vietnam vets and many
who have gone through the program. A placement director, for
instance, used to be homeless, living behind an elevator shaft in
the south Bronx.
   ``We believe the experience of serving in combat gave people
skills, abilities and values that are transferable to the
mainstream life,'' Gitelson said.
   The 57-year-old Scott, of Brooklyn, was in the Air Force during
the Korean War and an Army platoon sergeant in Vietnam in 1968 and
1969. After 12 years with the New York Army National Guard, he
started his own business, a parking garage, but was forced to give
it up when the rent went too high.
   Welfare and part-time work came next, and then he saw a
television ad for the program.
   ``It was one of the best things I ever did,'' he said. ``They
don't give you a job, but they prepare you for a job.''
   The first stage, called ``Basic Training,'' involves tests of
skills, intellect and personality that determine what kind of job
the vet is best suited for.
   Psychological and medical testing, Gitelson said, have uncovered
``brain injuries no one ever treated before.'' Group discussions,
classroom work and counseling lead to instruction in how to prepare
resumes and handle job interviews.
   Gitelson said 60 percent of the participants had been unemployed
for six to nine months when they entered the program; 50 percent
were transients.
   ``We're not talking about the easy guys,'' he said. ``But
they're wonderful guys, with talent, who have somehow fallen on
deaf ears.''
   The jobs they find are split 50-50 blue collar and white collar,
he said, averaging $18,000 annual starting pay, mostly with small
and medium-sized businesses and public agencies.
   The program started as simply a job placement service. When an
effort began to build a memorial in New York to Vietnam vets,
Gitelson's group supported it at public hearings.
   ``We wore suits _ everyone else was in jungle fatigues,'' he
said. ``We said we also have to do something about those who are
living.''
   Fifty cents of every dollar contributed to the memorial was
earmarked for a jobs program, and VVLP was selected as that program
with $500,000 to start. It is also supported by state and federal
funds.

   House members last year took trips to such
faraway places as Cyprus and Ireland and as near as the Oprah
Winfrey Show in Chicago. They made speeches, toured defense plants
and wrote magazine articles. They got gifts of golf sweaters and
boxes of chocolates.
   These and thousands of other details were listed in the latest
round of financial disclosure forms filed by more than 400 members
of the House of Representatives and released on Wednesday.
   In general, members' incomes towered over the average
American's. Most representatives' incomes topped the $100,000 mark
last year, with fees from speech-making and article-writing adding
substantially to their $89,500 annual salary. A handful reported
making under $100,000, while more than a dozen reported assets and
income over $1 million.
   The median family income in the United States is $31,526.
   The forms also offered a glimpse into the workings of Congress.
   For example:
   _Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, a member of the Appropriations
defense subcommittee, reported receiving money for speeches from
several defense companies, including Lockheed, Boeing, Rockwell,
Northrop, TRW, Aerojet, General Electric, LTV, Singer and McDonnell
Douglas.
   _Pennsylvania Rep. Bud Shuster, the second-ranking Republican on
the House Public Works and Transportation Committee and the senior
GOP member of the surface transportation subcommittee, reported
receiving air fare from the Outdoor Advertising Association for a
trip to Los Angeles. The association also paid him a $2,000
honorarium for a speech.
   In 1986, Shuster led a fight on the House floor against taking
down billboards on the nation's highways without ``just
compensation'' to the owner. The administrative aide to Shuster,
Ann Eppard, said Wednesday that Shuster was not so much defending
the outdoor advertising industry as the right to compensation if
one's property is seized.
   _Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee, received honoraria from a number of food and textile
groups, including the National Milk Producers, Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, Amstar Sugar Corp., Grocery Manufacturers, Western Cotton
Shippers, Monsanto, National Cotton Council and the American Farm
Bureau Federation. His reimbursed travel included a limousine ride
to White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., to attend a Grocery Manufacturers
meeting.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, reported earnings of at least
$168,000, although that did not include royalties from his book.
Published reports have said that Wright was paid royalties of 55
percent from his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' far above
the 10 percent to 15 percent authors normally receive.
   The royalties are crucial to a demand for an ethics committee
investigation of the Democratic leader.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich promised to sign the documents formally
triggering such an investigation today. For his part, the Georgia
Republican reported income of $122,284 to $133,283.
   Wright promised on Wednesday to cooperate in any investigation.
   ``Although I know my actions have been in full accordance with
House rules, I am concerned that the matters raised ... have led to
increased public discussion, which I believe is unwarranted ...,''
he said in a letter Tuesday to the ethics committee.
   The Texas Democrat also said that publication of the book had
been halted at his orders.
   While the politicians are required to reveal their finances, the
forms give only broad ranges for members' income, assets and debts.
   For example, one of the wealthier members of the House, Rep.
Bill Green, reported income of at least $1.5 million and probably
more than $3.3 million. The New York Republican listed assets of at
least $3.9 million and probably more than $9.2 million.
   Other wealthy House members and their minimum assets included
Norman Sisisky, D-Va., $8.27 million; Amory Houghton Jr., R-N.Y.,
$5.05 million; Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., $2.2 million; Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., $3.6 million; Don Edwards, D-Calif., $1.65
million; Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., $1 million; Pat Swindall, R-Ga.,
$2.265 million; Sidney Yates, D-Ill., $1.565 million; Fortney
Stark, D-Calif., $3.2 million; E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., $1.16 million;
and Mel Levine, D-Calif. $1.065 million.
   Many of these members reported liabilities, but all of them
appeared to have net worths of at least $1 million.
   While millions of dollars were revealed in the reports, so were
minuscule details.
   Among the exceptions to $100,000-plus incomes were: David
Bonior, D-Mich.; Tim Penny, D-Minn.; William Natcher, D-Ky.;
Clarence Miller, R-Ohio; Bob Dornan, R-Calif.; Julian Dixon,
D-Calif.; and Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y.
   Alex McMillan, R-N.C., reported a long list of gifts, ranging
from three boxes of chocolates and five neckties to a copy of the
September 1987 National Geographic magazine.
   Several House members apparently are avid golfers. They reported
receiving travel reimbursements for attending golf tournaments and
gifts of golf clothing and equipment. Among them was Rep. Fernand
St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House Banking Committee, who
got more than $1,200 in golf shoes, sweaters and accessories from
four charity golf tournaments.
   The trips by House members ranged from the appearance in Chicago
on the Oprah Winfrey Show by Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo. Mrs.
Schroeder also reported receiving two round-trip fares to Dublin,
Ireland. Rep. Peter H. Kostmayer, D-Pa., meanwhile, took an
educational trip to Greece and Cyprus financed by the Trade and
Tourism Alliance last July.
   Wright's disclosure form showed his income to be from $168,311
to $176,808. His salary as speaker was $115,000. His assets were
from $155,000 to $435,000 and his liabilities ranged from $105,000
to $220,000. He transferred investments valued from $140,000 to
$385,000 to a qualified blind trust last year.
   He received $45,850 in honoraria, donating $13,000 to charity.
   Other House leaders also reported substantial incomes.

   Here are some highlights of the catastrophic
health insurance legislation approved Wednesday by a House-Senate
conference committee:
   HOSPITAL _ Expands full coverage from maximum of 59 days a year
to 364 days. A ``first-day'' deductible will continue to be
required.
   DOCTOR BILLS _ Full payment of ``reasonable and proper'' doctor
bills after an annual deductible is met. The deductible, yet to be
precisely determined, will be from $1,320 and $1,400. Medicare
continues to pay 80 percent of charges, with the 20 percent not now
covered counting toward the annual deductible for the catastrophic
benefit.
   DRUGS _ Medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs, after
a $600 annual deductible, starting in 1991. Medicare pays 60
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter,
with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs. Medicare
now has no across-the-board prescription drug coverage.
   COSTS _ To be paid solely by Medicare beneficaries. Current Part
B premium of $24.80 to increase by about $4 a month in 1989. By
1993, the ``catastrophic'' monthly premium is projected at $10.20,
in addition to whatever the regular Part B premium is at that time.
More than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by
an additional ``supplemental'' premium that is linked to federal
income tax liability. The supplemental is estimated at $22 a year
per $150 of tax liability in 1989, rising to $42 a year per $150 of
tax liability in 1993.

<HEAD>House Panel Warns of Dangers of Long-Range Weapons Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration should be wary of
approving any deal with the Soviet Union that makes deep reductions
in the two superpowers' arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons, a
House Armed Services Committee report said.
   The Soviets would have a greater ability than the United States
either to break out of any such treaty or to illegally hide
weapons, according to the study by the panel's defense policy
subcommittee.
   The report was released Wednesday, shortly after President
Reagan left for Moscow for his fourth summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   One of the agenda items at the summit is the proposed Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty, which tentatively provides for reductions of
up to 50 percent in each nation's arsenal of long-range atomic
weapons.
   U.S. officials say they are aiming for a START treaty that would
leave each side with 6,000 long-range nuclear weapons. But many
differences remain to be resolved.
   The treaty would be a successor to a separate pact eliminating
medium-range nuclear weapons. The Senate is currently considering
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   ``No START agreement will come out of the summit next week and
that's good,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. ``There is a great deal to be done before arms
control policy and weapons system decisions are harmonized.''
   The report called the 6,000 figure ``an illusion'' because of
the proposed methods for counting nuclear weapons. For example, a
bomber would be counted as a single weapon, even though each
airplane could carry numerous nuclear bombs and missiles.
   ``Almost 3,400 more Soviet weapons could be `legal' under the
prospective agreement,'' the report said. ``Thus, a force of nearly
9,400 Soviet weapons could be legally available under START.''
   However, it noted, the same rules would apply to the United
States. ``In fact, because the United States has more bombers, it
would probably end up with more legal weapons. Thus, the actual
ceiling on weapons under START is more like 9,000-10,000 on each
side rather than 6,000,'' the study said.
   In addition, the study said, the treaty would be extremely
difficult to verify, opening up possibilities for cheating.
   The report also noted a key difference between the proposed
START pact and the medium-range treaty. The medium-range missile
pact bars flight testing of missiles such as the SS-20s. Supporters
of medium-range treaty say the ban means that if the Soviets are
hiding some SS-20s, the missiles would quickly degrade and be of
little military value.
   But no such ban is proposed by the START deal. ``So the military
capability of any concealed forces will not decline over time,''
the study said. That would give the Soviets incentive to cheat.
   The report also said that for political reasons, the Soviets
could find it easier to break out of START reductions.
   ``Given the history of U.S. strategic arms development, it seems
unlikely that the president would propose such a course (a
breakout) or the Congress approve it. A U.S. planner, however,
could not rely upon internal checks and balances in the Soviet
Union.''
   Given those uncertainties, U.S. military planners should worry
about a ``Soviet force not of 6,000 weapons, but of many, many
more,'' the study said.
   It concluded that maintaining the current doctrine of deterring
nuclear war with the threat of overwhelming retaliation will
require building the right type of U.S. nuclear force, even under
START restrictions.
   That force should include a number of relatively ``low value''
targets, such as single-warhead, land-based missiles, which are
widely dispersed. Such weapons are harder to hit, and thus increase
deterrence, when compared with ``high value'' weapons like the
10-warhead MX and the huge Trident missile-firing submarines, the
study said.
   But, the report said, ``the administration continues to deploy
fewer and bigger weapons platforms even as it pursues a START
agreement that favors smaller and more delivery systems.''

cuter than goats, but if you want to adopt a burro you can't be as
stubborn as a mule. You'll have to put your name on a waiting list.
   Since the federal government started its ``adopt-a-burro''
program in 1976 to alleviate serious overcrowding in western
states, thousands of the animals have been given out around the
country.
   While people were apprehensive about adopting the pets at first,
burro fever has soared. Now, there aren't enough around to meet the
demand _ especially in the East and Midwest.
   ``We've got a waiting list of over 200 people who want them,''
said Deedee King of the American Mustang and Burro Association in
Liberty Hill, Texas. ``They're kind of the pet rock of the '80s.''
   King said burros, which grow to the size of small ponies, make
great pets.
   ``They're really mellow and don't panic and get as flighty as
horses,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``They're really
social animals and very affectionate. Everybody says they turn into
great big puppy dogs.''
   But the animals, most of which are from Arizona and California,
also come in handy. They can pull carts and often are used for
predator control around smaller animals, such as sheep and goats.
   The 10,000-member association, which has placed about 700 burros
in three years, is working on a breeding program for the animals.
Just six years ago, federal authorities rounded up thousands of
wild burros in California, saying their growing numbers threatened
the environment.
   King, who also is a contractor of wild burros and horse adoption
for the U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, said
the government has placed more than 70,000 wild horses and burros
since 1976, but private organizations have placed thousands more.
   One of those groups, Friends of Burros Inc. based in Marcellus
in southwest Michigan, has placed about 160 burros in the state in
the last five years, said Allene Bell, president of the 40-member
group.
   ``We're basically a support group for the people here who've
adopted already,'' said Bell, a farmer who has adopted five burros.
``What we're involved in now is a burro rescue program and in cases
where we see abuse, we look to buy the animal and place it.''
   She decided to adopt the animals after hearing about the
roundups in the China Lake area of California in the early '80s.
Animal rights activists said the animals were being mistreated
during the government's roundup.
   Before Congress passed a law in 1971 to protect wild burros and
horses, the Bureau of Land Management usually got rid of the
animals by shooting them. However, the only animals protected are
those on land administered by the Interior Department, King said.
   A relatively small number of wild burros and horses remain
unprotected on military grounds and land owned by the U.S. Parks
Services, she said.

<HEAD>Bill Would Ban Nuclear Weapons In Philippines</HEAD>

   The Senate is one step away from
passing a bill that would ban nuclear weapons on Philippine
territory but allow port calls by nuclear-powered ships.
   The bill, tentatively approved on Wednesday, is aimed at U.S.
bases in the Philippines and some officials view it as a slap in
the face of the Americans.
   In another development, the military charged that six New
Zealanders have been linked to communist rebels who staged an
ambush in February in which a general's son and 10 other soldiers
were killed.
   The announcement followed military claims that foreign
journalists may have paid communist New People's Army guerrillas to
stage the ambush in Albay province in which Lt. Felix Brawner III
and 10 of his men were killed.
   Brawner was the only son of Brig. Gen. Felix Brawner Jr., who
retired last month as the military commander for northern Luzon.
   Regarding the Senate, Orlando Mercado, majority floor leader,
said the body is expected to pass the nuclear weapons bill next
week on its third reading, a formality where legislators officialy
register their votes.
   The bill prohibits manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons in
the country, but was amended to allow nuclear-powered vessels to
make port calls after they are inspected by Philippine authorities.
   The chief sponsor of the measure, Sen. Wigberto Tanada, is an
anti-nuclear activist who opposes U.S. bases in the Philippines.
   Most senators backed the bill and said it would give President
Corazon Aquino's administration a stronger hand in negotiating with
U.S. officials on the future of Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Base
and four smaller U.S. military facilities in the Philippines.
   Government sources, however, said Mrs. Aquino expressed
misgivings about the bill because of the negative affect it could
have on U.S.-Philippine ties.
   Sen. Mamintal Tamano, who earlier expressed concern about the
bill's implications, said:
   ``This is a backdoor way of repudiating the existing treaty
between the U.S. and the Philippines and the termination of the
bases agreement. The Americans will be very uncomfortable with such
a law, which will render the bases ineffective.''
   U.S. military policy forbids the military from disclosing which
vessels are carrying nuclear weapons.
   Similar legislation in Denmark led to a parliamentary election
and raised questions about that country's committment to the NATO
alliance.
   American aircraft carriers and other warships believed to carry
nuclear weapons call frequently at Subic. Many of them are either
in transit to the Persian Gulf or are returning from duty there.
   The claim linking foreign journalists to communist guerrillas
was made by an alleged former rebel, who said she was a member of a
guerrilla unit which staged the ambush in February, the military
said.
   She reportedly said the foreigners were journalists and that
they provided money and weapons to the guerrillas to stage the
attack.
   Military officials said captured rebel documents indicated the
six New Zealanders included five women and one man.
   In Wellington, the New Zealand Journalists Union and the Public
Service Association, which represents journalists employed by
state-owned media, said they had no records indicating the six are
journalists.
   In the documents, all six were identified as members of various
left-wing and women's organizations in New Zealand.
   One of the women identified herself as a member of the ``New
Zealand Conference for Filipino Concerns.'' She also reportedly
said she was a member of the Workers Communist League.

   Panamanian nationalism and suspicions
about U.S. intentions regarding the Panama Canal stiffened resolve
against the Reagan administration's efforts to dislodge Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Indeed, the breakdown of negotiations with the United States to
ease the de facto leader out of power was partially attributed in
Panama to the threat that such a deal could pose to treaties giving
Panama control of the canal.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz on Wednesday announced in
Washington the collapse of talks and said no further negotiations
are planned.
   Panama and the United States have been linked since this isthmus
achieved independence in 1903. In fact, it was U.S. backing that
secured Panama's break from Colombia and its declaring itself a
sovereign nation.
   The United States recognized the new nation immediately and
began an association that led to the construction of the Panama
Canal, the creation of the Canal Zone and the establishment of
military bases.
   Recovery of the Canal Zone, the area around the waterway, and of
the canal itself have long been a Panamanian goal.
   Panamanians still quote Noriega's predecessor, the late Gen.
Omar Torrijos, who negotiated the 1977 canal treaties with
then-President Jimmy Carter.
   Torrijos, who died in a 1981 plane crash and is a national idol,
once said: ``I do not want to enter history, I want to enter the
Canal Zone.''
   Washington's antipathy for Noriega began in 1987 after years of
overt and tacit support for the man who, like Torrijos, heads the
15,000-strong Panamanian Defense Forces and is the power behind the
civilian government.
   Noriega and his supporters say the reasons for that change are
Panamanians' unwillingness to bend to the giant of the north,
Noriega's inclination to make friends on the left, and what was
perceived as his presidential ambitions.
   Noriega also says Washington wants him out because he opposes
continued American military presence in Panama beyond Dec. 31,
1999, when the canal reverts to Panamanian control.
   It is believed in Panama that the Reagan administration's
failure to oust Noriega stems from its inability to realize the
support he enjoys among the military and the working class, as well
the United States' ill-founded confidence that the political
opposition could muster the necessary momentum.
   The resiliency of Panamanians to face economic hardships brought
on by tough U.S. sanctions also was unexpected.
   Washington has imposed increasingly severe economic sanctions
since Noriega was indicted in Florida in February on federal
drug-trafficking charges.
   But even opposition politicians say America's sudden dislike for
Noriega responds ``more to U.S. strategic interests than to concern
for the people of Panama,'' as Christian Democratic leader Ricardo
Arias Calderon put it.
   Many Panamanians have little use for Noriega or the Defense
Forces, a military and police organization that controls nearly
every aspect of life in Panama. Yet there is deep-seated suspicion
that the United States is unwilling to cede, just 11 years from
now, its extensive military installations.
   The U.S. Southern Command, established to defend the canal, has
evolved into an intelligence gathering center and coordinator of
U.S. military activities for all of Latin America.
   Already, the United States has given up the Canal Zone, a bit of
suburban America with manicured lawns and neatly painted houses,
and transferred partial control of the canal to Panama.
   Then the United States created the Panama Canal Commission, made
up of five Americans and four Panamanians, to administer the
waterway that links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Ten-thousand U.S. military personnel are now stationed at 10
facilities.
   ``The United States aims to sustain and improve this system of
military installations beyond the year 2000 ... to establish a much
larger force in Panama,'' said Maj. Daniel Delgado Diamante,
executive director for Panama for Canal Treaty Affairs.
   According to a military source in Panama, the Defense Forces
considers the Southern Command ``a watchtower for the United States
and a center of espionage. The information it provided the English
during the Falklands War was vital for them.''
   The possibility of renegotiating the U.S. military presence was
one of the Panamanian concessions in the canal treaties.
   Most important among the concessions was that the United States,
in accordance with its constitutional procedures, ``will always
have the right to take action to defend the canal and maintain its
neutrality.''
   Some Panamanians say this amounts to giving the United States
the permanent right to intervene in Panama.

<HEAD>Soviet Human Rights: Progress But Basic System of Repression
Unchanged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>

   During a speech several months ago, the
U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union used a water glass to describe
Soviet progress on human rights.
   Holding the glass aloft, Ambassador Jack Matlock said that it
would be inaccurate to view such a glass as half empty or half full.
   ``It's more like a glass that was dry and now has a little bit
of moisture in it,'' he said.
   The issue of human rights is one of the touchiest subjects on
the U.S.-Soviet agenda, evidenced by a sternly worded defense of
Soviet policies by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the
December summit in Washington.
   ``What moral right does America have to assume the pose of the
teacher?'' the general secretary asked. He said that he told
President Reagan, ``You are not the prosecutor and I am not the
accused. ... I am not on trial.''
   In an apparent attempt to soothe such touchiness, Reagan used
one of his pre-summit speeches earlier this month to laud Gorbachev
for taking steps to loosen the stringent restrictions on the
practice of religion, freedom of speech, press and emigration.
   In fact, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry reported last
week that 1,086 Jews departed the Soviet Union in April, the
highest monthly total in nearly seven years. Even though the figure
has been rising for about a year, it falls far short of the 1979
levels, when the monthly average was about 4,000 departures.
   As U.S. officials prepare to face their Soviet counterparts at
the Moscow summit _ the 10th session on human rights in 15 months _
they point to such signs of progress, even as they warn that the
basic system of repression has not changed.
   ``A few years ago, the entire process would have been simply
unthinkable,'' Richard Schifter, the assistant secretary of state
for human rights and humanitarian affairs, said recently.
   He called such discussions ``a good first step,'' but only the
beginning of an effort to see that the Soviet Union abides by the
human rights provisions of the Helsinki Final Act, which it signed
along with the United States in 1975.
   Besides pressing for movement in the traditional cases of
divided families, divided spouses and blocked marriages, the
administration also has on its human rights agenda the problems of
political prisoners, emigration and religious freedom.
   ``You cannot speak of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly,
freedom of association, freedom of the press being recognized in
the Soviet Union, that is not the case. ... But sledgehammer
tactics are no longer being used,'' Schifter said.
   Freedoms are still severely limited but people are not being
punished as harshly for alleged transgressions. While
demonstrations are still broken up, he said, the demonstrators
might be arrested for a while and released, rather than being sent
to Siberia for several years.
   Shifter said it also appears that the Soviet leadership ``has
basically given up on the deep commitment ... to conducting
atheistic propaganda. That doesn't mean they have more respect for
religion than they had previously, but they simply have decided
that this just isn't working ... and they might as well tackle the
situation differently.''
   He described the human rights situation as ``coming up to a
better level from very, very far below, but nevertheless, there's a
trend there and all we can say is we wish it would continue and
perhaps accelerate.''
   Other experts have suggested that whatever change is taking
place is partially due to the Soviet leadership's domestic concerns
rather than reaction to outside presssures.
   One administration expert, speaking on condition he not be
identified, pointed to Gorbachev's overtures to the religious
communities, in particular his meeting with a group of Russian
Orthodox archbishops. The session apparently was held to show that
his ``glasnost'' policy of increased openness included religion.
   ``That could very well be seen as an effort of the Soviet
authorities to mobilize a very large portion of the population,
which has been practically excluded from civil life for decades, ''
the official said.
   He said that Gorbachev was impressive ``in recognizing that
believers are Soviet patriots and Soviet citizens who can
contribute.''
   Seen in this light, Reagan's planned visit to the Danilov
monastery and his discussions with Soviet dissidents and refuseniks
are not expected to overly concern Soviet officialdom, said another
administration expert on the Soviet Union.
   ``They'll act like it won't bother them, they know it's going to
occur and they know the president won't do anything gratuitously
embarrassing,'' he said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has met with dissident
Andrei Sakharov and Gorbachev had sessions with American citizens
during the Washington summit last December so it is fully
anticipated that Reagan will hold such sessions, the expert said.
   ``They clearly know they have to do something on human rights to
improve relations with the United States, but they won't admit
it,'' he said. ``They want it to appear to be their initiative, and
if that's the case, that's just fine.''

   The hospitalization of Ferdinand
Marcos in Hawaii has added a new twist to the bizarre drama in
which Marcos supporters are trying to use his mother's unburied
body to help their hero return home.
   Marcos was admitted on Wednesday to St. Francis Medical Center
in Honolulu suffering from chest pains.
   The Philippine consul in Honolulu, Tomas Gomez, accused the
70-year-old Marcos of faking his illness to win sympathy in the
Philippines.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, said in a radio interview today that her
husband was suffering because President Corazon Aquino has refused
to allow him to return to bury his 95-year-old mother, Josefa
Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno reiterated on Wednesday
that Mrs. Aquino would never waver from the ban, imposed in 1986
after Marcos was forced into exile following a civilian-military
uprising.
   Meanwhile, the remains of Marcos' mother, a former
schoolteacher, continue to lie in state in a suburban church, where
dozens of Marcos followers have maintained a round-the-clock vigil
since her death three weeks ago.
   Indeed, the body of ``Dona Josefa'' has become the focus of
renewed protests by Marcos' dwindling followers to demand their
leader be allowed to come home.
   They have pledged that the body will stay in the church until
Marcos returns to bury it. Mortician Frank Malabed said he embalmed
the body twice and it could remain unburied for up to three months.
   To press their point, Marcos loyalists have organized street
marches, some drawing up to 10,000 people, where speakers rail
against the government for denying Marcos the ``human right'' to
bid farewell to his mother.
   The use of corpses as political instruments is not without
precedence in Philippine politics. The 1983 assassination of Mrs.
Aquino's husband, Benigno, was exploited by Marcos opponents to
mount street protests against the government.
   More than 1 million Filipinos turned out for Aquino's funeral 10
days after his assassination. Benigno Aquino's mother, Aurora,
refused to have the body, which lay in state in an open casket,
cleaned by morticians, saying she wanted the ``whole world to see
what they have done to my son.''
   Marcos' sister, Elizabeth Keon, was buried two weeks after her
death in December 1986 as the family lobbied unsuccessfully with
the Aquino government to allow the former president to return for
the funeral.
   But even by Philippine standards, the saga of ``Dona Josefa''
has dragged on to bizarre lengths.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos is expected to be buried in the family plot
in Batac in the northern Philippine province of Ilocos Norte. But
an employee of the suburban church, who refused to give her name,
said the family has still not informed the parish staff when the
body will be moved.
   ``The family has not yet set any particular date for the
funeral,'' Marcos' sister, Fortuna Barba, told reporters on
Wednesday. ``When we do decide, it will be properly announced and
disseminated by us and nobody else.''
   Uncertainty about the funeral date appears to reflect divisions
within the pro-Marcos camp among various groups seeking to
demonstrate that they speak for the ``Apo,'' or ``Grand Old Man,''
as Marcos is known to his followers.
   One group has called for a huge caravan to accompany the body
from Manila north to Batac, a distance of 240 miles. They have
suggested stopping at cities along the way for public viewings in a
bid to stir up support in Marcos' northern strongholds.
   On Tuesday, rumors spread that Marcos supporters would hold a
pre-dawn mass Wednesday morning and then spirit the body secretly
to Batac. Reporters rushed to the church, Sanctuario de San Jose,
only to find the coffin still there.
   The unseemly performance prompted Mrs. Barba to issue a
statement warning against ``conjectures, speculations, canards or
disinformation to mislead and confuse the people.''
   Meanwhile, residents of the swank Greenhills neighborhood, where
the church is located, have threatened to launch a petition drive
to demand that Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin intervene and order
the body removed.

   Despite the gay and lesbian protesters who
picket campaign appearances by Democratic front-runner Michael
Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor is virtually certain to get
their votes in the fall.
   ``The choice is pretty obvious. Lesbians and gay men will vote
for Mike Dukakis in the fall'' when presented with a choice between
Dukakis and Republican George Bush, said Sue Hyde, who was sharply
critical of Dukakis over his position on foster care by homosexuals
for children.
   Vin McCarthy, a Boston lawyer in charge of the Dukakis
campaign's efforts to reach out to the gay community, said, ``There
is no question in my mind that he will receive the lion's share of
the gay and lesbian vote in November.''
   It is Dukakis' support for giving heterosexual couples
preference in placement of children in foster homes that draws gay
protestors to his appearances, but many political strategists say
the Massachusetts governor comes out ahead politically on that
confrontation.
   ``The vast majority of the American people agree with Dukakis,''
said Robert Beckel, who managed Walter F. Mondale's 1984
presidential campaign. ``From a political standpoint, that's a
no-win issue for the gay community.''
   In fact, many Republicans working to elect Bush chafe at the
fact that Dukakis is being perceived as a moderate because of his
primary battles with Jesse Jackson and because he is being picketed
by homosexual groups.
   A Democratic Party strategist, speaking only with assurance of
anonymity, said that a candidate such as Dukakis, on the verge of
winning the party's presidential nomination, is not looking to
create fights.
   ``But to the degree that you have to have somebody picket you,
you certainly would not mind the gays picketing you over the issue,
not of civil rights or civil liberties, but over foster care for
children, saying your law is too pro-family or too
pro-heterosexual,'' the Democrat said.
   Still, foster care is a highly charged issue in the gay
community.
   ``For Dukakis to have gone out of his way to limit or restrict
the parenting options for lesbians and gay men was a kick in the
gut,'' said Hyde, director of the privacy project for the National
Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   Hyde said she believes Dukakis considers lesbians and gay men
``sexual criminals.''
   While campaigning in California prior to that state's June 7
presidential primary, Dukakis repeatedly has encountered gay
demonstrators.
   ``Bush + Dukakis ... More AIDS Deaths,'' read signs carried by
demonstrators at a recent Dukakis appearance in Los Angeles.
   ``We need a president who's not afraid to talk about AIDS,''
shouted a demonstrator.
   A disproportionate number of victims of AIDS _ acquired immune
deficiency syndrome _ are homosexuals.
   Dukakis responded that Massachusetts ``spends more per case for
AIDS than any state in America.'' He repeatedly referred to AIDS as
``the most serious public health problem we've had in our
lifetime.''
   Hyde said that in 1985 there was no funding for AIDS in the
state budget and money was later included only after pressure from
Dukakis' state health director.
   ``People were pretty upset about it,'' she said. ``Since that
time I think that Dukakis' administration has been fairly
responsive. It was only after this pretty major outcry in the
Boston area around the zero-funding that they responded.''
   When the Massachusetts governor appeared before a group of
homosexual activists in Los Angeles, he was asked repeatedly about
the foster care policy.
   ``Because I think it's best, all things being equal, for a child
to grow up in a household with a mother and father and other
children,'' he said.
   ``Bigot,'' shouted one man. ``You're anti-gay, why don't you
admit it,'' yelled another.
   The Massachusetts policy on placing of foster children gives
preference to heterosexual couples with child-raising experience
and to relatives of the child in need of care.
   Dukakis vetoed legislation that would have prohibited homosexual
couples from providing foster care.
   McCarthy said, ``There's a perception in the gay community that
the governor did damage to the gay and lesbian community when he
adopted the foster care policy. Attitudinal issues are always the
toughest things to work through.''
   But, he said, ``Notwithstanding the anger, much of which was
legitimate _ I certainly felt it as a gay supporter of Mike Dukakis
_ he has stayed stable in terms of his commitment to gay and
lesbian civil rights and in terms of a sound and balanced AIDS
policy.''

   State and Long Island Lighting Co.
negotiators early Thursday reached a tentative agreement that would
see the utility abandon the $5.3 billion Shoreham nuclear power
plant, the governor's office said.
   Should the agreement be finalized, it would mark the first time
a completed U.S. nuclear power plant was abandoned before it opened.
   The agreement, announced by Gary Fryer, a spokesman for Gov.
Mario Cuomo, would allow financially troubled LILCO to continue to
operate as a privately owned utility. The state had been proceeding
with a possible takeover of the entire company.
   The agreement in principle was announced 95 minutes after
Cuomo's midnight deadline for an agreement. On Wednesday, Cuomo had
threatened to call off negotiations if LILCO failed to agree to a
deal and then resume the state's court suit to keep Shoreham closed.
   At one point early Thursday, Fryer told reporters that the deal
had been called off shortly before midnight but then quickly
retracted the statement after apparently receiving further
information.
   Details of the agreement weren't immediately available. But
Cuomo had demanded that LILCO restructure its management and cease
its efforts to win a license to operate at 25 percent capacity.
   Those conditions have been met as part of the deal, Fryer said.
   As part of the agreement, the state would buy Shoreham for $1
and have it decontaminated and decommissioned at LILCO's expense,
Fryer said. New generating plants would then be built on Long
Island to ensure that residents have a sufficient supply of
electricity.
   ``The next step would be to reduce all these intricacies to
written copy,'' Fryer said.
   If approved, the deal will end years of attempts by
environmentalists, local activists and others to close Shoreham, on
Long Island's north shore.
   The plant, completed in 1984, has never been opened because of
the refusal of state and local officials to approve an emergency
evacuation plan. The officials had argued that Long Island, because
of its geography, could not be safely evacuation during a nuclear
accident and without such approval the federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission had refused to issue an operating license.
   But state efforts to close Shoreham accelerated after the NRC in
October eliminated the rule requiring state and local government
participation in an evacuation plan.
   The future of the plant has been in limbo for years and the
delays in construction and the licensing effort, along with massive
cost overruns, drove LILCO to near bankruptcy.
   The plant, conceived in 1965, was completed 10 years late and
more than 80 times over its original budget of $65 million.
   In addition to fears over the Shoreham plant's safety,
negotiations have been driven by the fact that LILCO's nearly 1
million customers pay the second highest electricity rates in the
country, second only to neighboring Consolidated Edison.
   The utility's problems were highlighted after Hurricane Gloria
in September 1985 knocked out power to more than 80 percent of
LILCO's customers. During the storm, LILCO Chairman William
Catacosinos refused to return home from an Italy vacation.
   Safety fears were heightened after the nuclear disaster at the
Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Union.

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis, trying to establish a bond with voters 3,000 miles
from home, says California has ``great similiarities'' to his home
state of Massachusetts.
   Dukakis was in California today, campaigning in advance of the
June 7 primary. But California's 47 electoral votes make it the
biggest prize in the general election, and Dukakis tentatively has
made plans to return shortly after the primary for additional
campaigning.
   Both Massachusetts and California have a ``very strong
commitment to education,'' he said Wednesday night during a debate
with rival Jesse Jackson, brushing aside a comment from a panelist
that there also were notable differences.
   ``We are both high-tech states,'' he went on. ``We're both
states that value our environment ... we're both states and regions
that are coastal, states and regions that understand how important
these ocean resources and coastline happen to be, and how important
it is to preserve them.''
   Dukakis, a methodical man campaigning in a state known for
flamboyance, made his pitch to the California voters as he set out
on a quick campaign swing through the state on Wednesday.
   And as befits the almost-certain Democratic nominee, he made it
clear that he is looking beyond the primary to the November
election.
   In his five-minute closing statement during the debate, he not
only appealed for support in the primary _ less than two weeks away
_ but also pointed out that voters will face a choice between two
very different candidates in the fall.
   Public opinion polls show him leading Jackson in California, and
ahead of Vice President George Bush, the certain Republican
nominee, in a fall matchup.
   Dukakis took care not to offend his Democratic rival during
their hour-long debate, but he also held his ground when Jackson
tried to pressure him into proposing a detailed budget plan and
into declaring South Africa a terrorist state for its support of
rebels fighting neighboring black governments.
   Dukakis says it is too early to make a detailed spending plan,
and wants to pursue other measures against South Africa, including
stronger economic sanctions, before considering tougher measures.
   The two men met privately after the debate, although the
governor declined to say what they discussed beyond ``a lot of
things, family, campaign debates, issues.''
   Dukakis used his time during the debate to repeat criticisms of
President Reagan's policies, but he also issued a statement wishing
the president a ``successful summit'' with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``Today we have the best opportunity in our lifetimes to reduce
the risk of nuclear war,'' he said.
   During the debate, he said the superpowers should stop
``wandering around the world like lonesome cowboys'' intervening
militarily.

<TEXT>
   To his followers, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega is a symbol of Panamanian nationalism _ a brave David
standing firm against the imperialist Goliath of Washington.
   Detractors see Panama's military leader as an unscrupulous
despot who threatens to drag the country down with him.
   The general is a shrewd, tough child of poverty, schooled in
intrigue.
   As far as the White House is concerned, Noriega is criminal, a
man who enriched himself by selling his country to Colombian drug
traffickers.
   On Wednesday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced that
talks with Noriega's people on the general's exit from power had
broken down.
   Noriega managed to become head of the Defense Forces _ chief of
Panama's military and police _ through his loyalty to his
predecessor and mentor, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
   Noriega, whose official biography says he is 50, has little
faith in the ability of civilians to rule.
   ``Our young officers are much better prepared to govern when
Panama takes over the (Panama) Canal operations in the year 2000,''
he once said in an interview.
   The handsome, charismatic Torrijos changed the Defense Forces
from an organization led by the social elite into a tightly
disciplined force of 15,000 with absolute police, military and
political power.
   He opened the upper ranks to the lower economic classes and
created a base of power from a new generation of officers. Noriega,
a poor boy who went to military school in Peru on a scholarship,
was among them.
   Less than a year after taking power in a coup in 1968, Torrijos
made Noriega, an obscure provincial lieutenant with only four years
of military service, his chief of intelligence.
   Noriega quickly began collecting dossiers on everyone who
counted in Panama, friends and enemies alike. He developed close
ties with U.S. intelligence agencies interested in any potential
threat to the security of the Panama Canal, a vital shipping link
between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Torrijos also gave Noriega jurisdiction over customs and
immigration, long a source of funds for the military.
   After Torrijos died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981, it
took Noriega about two years to shoulder his way to the top
command. Once there, Noriega boldly exercised his power and
tolerated little opposition.
   He closed the private news media for months at a time for
alleged offenses ranging from personal insults to incitment to
disobedience. Unhappy with the outcome of the first popular
election in 16 years, Noriega installed his own president in 1984.
   Noriega, a short, jowly, pockmarked man his detractors call
``pineapple face,'' never possessed the charisma of his populist
mentor, but he was backed by the Democratic Republican Party, which
Torrijos founded.
   As demands for Noriega's ouster have grown during the past year,
the party vowed to stick by him ``to the end'' and portrayed him as
the defender of Panamanian ``sovereignty and dignity'' in the face
of U.S. aggression.
   Noriega has worked hard to develop the image of a man of the
people. His private life is that of a rich man, but publicly he has
stressed his humble origins and spent weekends courting the
residents of rural towns and villages.
   With the deepening of his political crisis, Noriega has tried to
use his popular image to build support in this nation of 2.2
million people, many of them black and mulatto.
   ``The humble, the poor, the blacks, they are the utmost
authority of this people,'' he said in one speech.
   His official salary is $60,000 a year but he is said to have his
finger in a wide range of enterprises, among them duty-free liquor
stores, maritime services, banks, gambling casinos, newspapers, a
television station and 12 radio stations.

<HEAD>Foreign Aid Bill Denies Money To Drug-Trafficking Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has sent to the Senate a $14.3
billion foreign aid bill that includes a ban on aid to any foreign
government or military force involved in drug trafficking, bribery,
tax evasion, graft or price fixing.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., offered the amendment banning aid to
those nations involved in drugs or other crimes after Rep. Robert
Walker, R-Pa., offered one limited to drugs.
   ``If we're against the baddies of this world, we might as well
be against them all,'' Obey said.
   Obey's amendment was approved on a voice vote.
   The foreign aid bill, passed by the House on a 328-90 vote, was
the first separate foreign aid package the the House has approved
since 1981. Lawmakers generally are reluctant to support spending
overseas when domestic needs go unfulfilled, and in recent years,
the legislation has been buried in large, catchall spending bills.
   But last fall's deficit reduction agreement set the overall
foreign aid spending level for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. A
bipartisan compromise, with administration support, was reached in
the House Appropriations Committee on how to divide up that pie.
   About $5.8 billion of the total would be earmarked for military
aid, $3.3 billion in economic grants, and most of the remainder for
the United Nations and international organizations and financial
institutions.
   Overall, the bill would continue current programs and authorize
about 2 percent more spending than last year, reversing the trend
of the past few years to cut foreign aid.
   Israel and Egypt would receive about a third of the money in the
bill. Israel again would receive more than any other country, $1.8
billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in economic assistance.
Egypt would get $1.3 billion in military assistance and $815
million in economic aid.
   Pakistan would receive $220 million in economic aid and $240
million dollars in forgiven loans for purchase of military goods.
   The Philippines would receive about $250 million, half in
military assistance. About $700 million in economic assistance
would go to African countries.
   In Central America, Honduras would get $85 million in economic
aid, Costa Rica $90 million, El Salvador $185 million and Guatemala
$80 million. Military aid for those and other countries was not
earmarked, but would come out of separate military aid and credit
accounts. Aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua was not part of the
legislation.
   About 100 countries receive U.S. aid directly.
   Besides Obey's amendment, another voice vote removed the
earmarking of money for specific countries cooperating with U.S.
drug eradication efforts, allowing the individual totals to be set
later based on the performance of the countries.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Legislation to Ban Plastic Handguns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has joined the House in taking aim
against plastic guns, whether they be handguns designed to pass
through metal detectors or just toys.
   By a voice vote, the Senate on Wednesday approved legislation to
outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of handguns made from
plastic or other ``undetectable'' parts that could evade metal
detectors.
   The measure primarily is directed at terrorists and airplane
hijackers, but was amended to include a requirement that all toy
guns have orange plugs in their barrels to clearly identify them as
toys.
   ``This bill is designed to prevent a nightmare from becoming
reality,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who co-sponsored
the legislation with Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   ``Its aim is to keep terrorists from getting powerful,
undetectable firearms which could be smuggled past security devices
at airports, courtrooms and even the White House,'' Metzenbaum said.
   The plastic gun ban is similar to legislation approved by the
House, 413-4, earlier this month. Differences between the two bills
will have to be ironed out before the gun ban is sent to President
Reagan for his signature.
   The nation's major law enforcement groups lobbied heavily for
the legislation, and worked out the compromise language with
Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The National Rifle Association,
after initial reluctance, went along with the approach.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a sponsor of the
amendment to clearly identify toy guns, said realistic plastic guns
``have been used in the commission of crimes, such as bank robbery,
hostage takings and street crime.''
   Dole also recalled that in one case, ``a police officer in
California accidentally shot a youth playing with a toy laser gun,
after mistaking the toy for a firearm.''
   An amendment by Metzenbaum added provisions that would make it a
crime to possess a firearm in a federal courtroom, increase
penalties for possession of explosives in airports and boost
penalties for use or possession of explosives in commission of a
federal felony.
   The Senate legislation would require that all firearms be as
detectable as a 3.7-ounce stainless steel handgun. All guns
currently manufactured or imported into the United States would
have to meet the test.
   While the Senate bill sets a detectability standard, the
House-passed measure requires that the gun itself contain 3.7
ounces of metal.
   The Senate measure also would require that new, state-of-the-art
metal detectors be used at airports, federal courthouses and other
federal security checkpoints. The House bill does not include the
metal detector provision.

<HEAD>Town With Traditional Claims on Lifeguards Can't Afford Them This
Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Budget problems will force beachgoers to swim
at their own risk this summer in this town, which has its own
lifesaving museum.
   ``It's not funded,'' Selectman Claudette Fitzsimmons said of the
lifeguard allotment. ``It's not going to be funded.''
   The town 10 miles southeast of Boston has allocated less than
$24,000 to pay eight full-time and four part-time summer police
officers, about equal to the payroll for 10 lifeguards and a
supervisor.
   When the budget was being considered, ``it came down to a
judgment call whether it was seasonal lifeguards or seasonal police
officers,'' said Exeuctive Administrator Christopher J. McCabe.
   So, four beaches normally supervised by Hull lifeguards will not
be staffed this year.
   Police Chief Donald F. Brooker contended that summer police are
badly needed to deal with overflows on hot days. Hull's population
of 10,000 swells to 100,000 on the hottest days.
   Hull is in the middle of a prolonged fiscal crisis. A referendum
is scheduled for June 27 to seek approval for an additional $1.5
million in taxes on top of the already approved $15 million
operating budget. None of the additional money is slated for
lifeguards.
   Local hero Joshua James's rescue of shipwreck victims more than
100 years ago gave rise to Hull's claim to lifesaving fame.
   Judith Wiers, director of the Hull Lifesaving Museum, said it's
ironic that a town with Hull's history would have to cut its
lifeguards.
   ``We have a really strong fire department that wears a badge of
Joshua James on their sleeves; some are descendants of the original
lifesavers,'' she said. ``There's a commitment to lives here.''

<HEAD>Judge Sentences Child Abuser To Life On Birth Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who left her infant sons alone
for three hot days was ordered to practice birth control for the
rest of her child-bearing years by a judge who rebuked her as a
``child having children.''
   Other terms of a lifetime probation given to Debra Ann Forster
prohibit her from seeing the two boys as well as a daughter she
later bore. She must also provide weekly reports to the probation
office on her birth control use.
   Ms. Forster, 18, pleaded guilty in April to two counts of felony
child abuse for leaving her two sons alone in an apartment, without
food or water, for three days last May. She could have received 30
years in prison.
   The boys, William and Scott, respectively 18 months- and 6
months-old at the time, were hospitalized eight days for
malnutrition, lesions caused by a rash and dehydration. Scott was
close to death from dehydration when he was found, the police said.
Both have since recovered.
   Temperatures for the three-day period ranged from 100 during the
day and 73 at night; the average was 87 degrees, the National
Weather Service says.
   The children were found by Ms. Forster's estranged husband,
Bill, who called police. Authorities removed the children from the
house and Ms. Forster was arrested hours later when she showed up
at the Mesa Police Department.
   Judge Lindsay Ellis Budzyn said the sentence was the only way
she could make sure the woman would not hurt other children since
society offers little or no support for potential abusers.
   ``We don't have a lot of help out there for people,'' the
Maricopa County Superior Court judge said in an interview
Wednesday, a day after issuing the sentence.
   But Alice Bendheim, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney,
called it ``an incredible sentence,'' and doubted it would hold up
under constitutional pressures.
   ``I'm sure Judge Budzyn thought it was a sentence that fit the
crime but we have a system that doesn't allow such an intrusion
into private life,'' said Ms. Bendheim, who is on the ACLU's
national board.
   As the judge pronounced the sentence she told Ms. Forster,
``Your case represents the epitome of what's wrong with our
society: a child having children.''
   ``I know I did something wrong, and I have to pay for it,'' Ms.
Forster replied. ``I'm sorry.''
   On Wednesday, the judge characterized Ms. Forster as a young
woman of average intelligence who is emotionally immature.
   Ms. Forster gave birth to a daughter while in jail awaiting the
child-abuse trial. According to court records, a family friend
adopted the daughter, and the sons were being placed through an
adoption agency.
   Ms. Forster was released from custody Tuesday and will live in a
treatment center. Court officials have refused to release the name
of the center, saying Ms. Forster has received death threats.
   Although the order requires the woman to submit written proof to
her probation officer that she is using some form of birth control,
she will not be required to undergo any physical testing, Budzyn
said.
   ``There would be no way, with an order like this, that she would
be subject to physical tests,'' the judge said.
   Bruce Griffen, a defense attorney in a 1986 child-abuse case in
which the defendant was initially sentenced to undergo
sterilization, said he believed the judge had gone too far.
   ``I think the court has acted outside its role and
limitations,'' Griffen said.
   The Arizona Supreme Court later vacated the sterilization
sentence in the case, in which the abused child died.
   Griffen said that ruling could apply to an appeal of the
sentence by Ms. Forster's attorney, Assistant Public Defender
Robert Billar.
   Billar was said by his office to be in court Wednesday and not
available for comment.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel is calling for a tax on some of
the activities of colleges, hospitals and other non-profit
organizations that often compete directly with taxpaying businesses.
   Under a proposal that won tentative approval of the House Ways
and Means oversight subcommittee Wednesday, college bookstores
might have to pay tax on some of their computer sales, and a museum
might be taxed on food sales if an eating facilities caters
primarily to the general public.
   Although aides said the package of proposals was given a
preliminary endorsement by most subcommittee members, it is a long
way from becoming law in this election year. No similar legislation
is pending in the Senate.
   Neither Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee,
nor Don Chapoton, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax
policy, who assisted in drafting the proposals, would comment on
their content. The legislation was put together behind closed doors.
   However, a subcommittee staff member, who would not be quoted by
name, offered reporters a general outline of the package and said
the Treasury Department agrees with most of the provisions. She
said the subcommittee would take a final look at the package early
next month.
   The proposals would strengthen the ``unrelated-business-income
tax,'' which was enacted in 1950 to protect small businesses
against unfair competition from tax-exempt organizations. The
subcommittee began drafting the new legislation after months of
complaints from businesses that they are still finding it hard to
compete.
   Chapoton, testifying before the subcommittee earlier this month,
cautioned against any broad overhaul of the tax, but he endorsed an
effort to apply the tax specifically to certain activities of
tax-exempt organizations. It was that approach that won preliminary
endorsement of Pickle's subcommittee.
   In general, income from gift shops and bookstores operated by
tax-exempt organizations would be taxed, with exceptions for
low-cost mementos. The tax would be applied to most catalog and
mail-order sales.
   A college bookstore could continue to avoid tax on income from
items that are ``in furtherance of educational programs'' _
textbooks, for example _ and on a portion of computer sales to
students. One subcommittee member said the bookstore could avoid
tax on sales of computers to up to half the student body per year,
so long as a professor signed a statement that a computer was a
necessity for a course.
   The tax also would be applied to income from some sales or
rental of medical equipment, including hearing aids and oxygen
tanks. Travel and tour services offered by schools, museums and
other non-profit organizations would fall under the tax, as would
their adjunct off-premise food services. The tax would apply to
most hotel facilities that are patronized by the general public.
   Authorities have not estimated how much tax would be collected
under the proposal. However, aides emphasize the package is aimed
at improving fairness _ not raising revenue.
   At the Ways and Means hearing earlier this month, Frank S.
Swain, chief advocacy counsel for the Small Business
Administration, said present law has ``allowed non-profits to earn
non-taxable income from activities never contemplated by Congress.
... The distinction between the two sections has become blurred _
in some instances, beyond recognition.''

   A spokesman for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega said Washington staged a ``vulgar ambush'' by hinting the
U.S.-Panama crisis was ending then blaming the military leader for
the collapse of negotiations.
   Some Noriega associates said the talks were not over yet.
   Panama's 67-member Legislative Assembly has summoned Noriega for
a status report on the negotiations. Opposition parties said they
would not attend. Noriega is scheduled to appear before the
assembly this afternoon.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said on Wednesday that
a U.S. negotiating effort to induce Noriega, the power behind the
civilian government, to go into exile this summer broke down and no
further talks were planned.
   ``At the final moment in negotiations, Noriega would not carry
through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated,''
Shultz said. ``No offers remain on the table.''
   A pro-government newspaper, La Republica, said the military was
nervous about some of the tentative agreements.
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, Noriega's spokesman, called the situation a
``vulgar ambush mounted by the State Department and Shultz'' aimed
at throwing Noriega off balance and regaining the lost American
initiative.
   Lopez noted that Noriega had said publicly there could be no
agreement as long as American ``aggression'' against Panama
continued and that the talks were ``conversations'' not
negotiations.
   A Panamanian government spokesman, Boris Moreno, said the United
States ``failed in an attempt to impose its demands, then tried to
put out false versions of the events.''
   Moreno contended that Panamanian negotiators never agreed to
discuss dismissal of U.S. drug smuggling charges against Noriega.
He added that the sole Panamanian aim was to ``cease economic
aggression and military threats against the Panamanian people.''
   Key provisions of the proposed agreement called for Noriega's
resignation in August as commander of the Panamanian Defense
Forces, his departure from Panama and, in exchange, the dismissal
of the drug smuggling indictments.
   The goal was to remove Noriega from the Panamanian political
scene as the country moved toward civilian-led rule with
presidential elections in May 1989.
   The United States has been seeking Noriega's removal since he
was indicted in February by a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges of taking at least $4.6 million in payoffs from Colombia's
so-called Medellin cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder
money and hide drug smugglers from law enforcement officials.
   Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, who represents Noriega on the drug
indictments, said in Miami that he doubts the talks have ended.
   ``I have heard that only from the secretary of state and I
remember hearing the secretary of state say that last March,''
Sonnett said on Wednesday.
   La Republica said the critical issue was the presidency of
Manuel Solis Palma, who took over after Noriega engineered the
dismissal of President Eric Arturo Delvalle in February.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as the nation's
legitimate president. Delvalle has been in hiding since his ouster
and there is an arrest warrant out for him.
   La Republica said the military ``rejected the points of
conversation because they found no guarantee for the continuity of
the constitutional mandate'' of Solis Palma.
   Military officials also feared the agreement as proposed would
cause ``political confrontations among Panamanians,'' the newspaper
said.
   ``For us Solis Palma is president, but the United States insists
on recognizing Delvalle,'' said Luis Gomez, a legislator from the
governing Revolutionary Democratic Party and a close ally of
Noriega.
   He contended the talks are only in ``recess'' after an inability
to smooth out a few final problems.
   Both Delvalle and Solis Palma were put in office by the
military, come from relative political obscurity and are part of a
long line of similar presidents.

<HEAD>Record Company Awarded $3.2 Million in Dispute over George Benson
Albums</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has ruled that Warner Bros. Records
must pay more than $3.2 million in damages to a rival record-maker
for breaching an agreement with Grammy Award-winning jazz guitarist
George Benson.
   The suit, filed by Creed Taylor Inc., alleged that Warner Bros.
earned more than $20 million in net profits from three albums that
the guitarist made while he was obliged to make three records for
CTI.
   CTI alleged it was forced into bankruptcy proceedings because it
lost Benson, who was the top recording artist on the CTI label when
the agreement was made in 1975.
   The 11-member Los Angeles County Superior Court jury agreed
Wednesday that the agreement had been breached, but jurors appeared
to be deadlocked in trying to determine whether Warner had acted
with malice or fraud.
   Judge Dion G. Morrow said he would declare a mistrial on that
portion of the lawsuit if the jury was unable to reach a decision
today.
   Benson won three Grammy Awards in 1976, including two for songs
from his Warner album, ``Breezin','' one of the biggest selling
jazz albums of all time. He followed that with two other albums on
the Warner label, ``In Flight'' and ``Weekend in L.A.''
   Attorneys for Warner argued that the company's net profits from
the three albums amounted to only $10.8 million, and that even if
CTI's allegations were true, its profits would have been far less
than that.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III is waging an
aggressive campaign to offset the political damage his legal
troubles have caused the Republican Party, says a congressman.
   In two meetings Wednesday which he initiated, Meese made clear
he has no intention of resigning and intends to advance the
conservative agenda in the waning months of the Reagan
administration, said participants in the discussions.
   He said the Justice Department will aggressively prosecute child
pornography cases, work to break a logjam on judicial nominations
and help lead the administration's attack on drugs.
   Meese offered an 18-page rebuttal to criticism of his assistance
to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and told another group of
conservatives, the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation,
his conduct has been entirely proper.
   At a meeting with 16 conservative congressmen, ``a couple of
members'' said the year-old criminal investigation of Meese is
resulting in ``political damage being done,'' said Robert Walker,
R-Pa., head of a group of conservative House members called the
Conservative Opportunity Society. Walker said the context of
``political damage'' was to the Republican Party and the
presidential campaign of Vice President George Bush, the likely GOP
nominee.
   Walker said Meese was told that if he is going to take an
aggressive stance in response to criticism, it ``is going to have
to be a very good offense.''
   Meese ``acknowledged he would have to take that kind of
(aggressive) position to stem the political damage,'' said Walker.
``He felt he had a duty in terms of himself and the law and
politics to clear the air.
   ``He made it quite clear that he has no intention of
resigning,'' said Walker.
   Meese also met at his own urging with senior editors of The
Washington Times, a conservative newspaper that recently called on
the attorney general to resign.
   In a report on the interview today, Meese said he ``recently''
discussed his legal problems with Bush.
   ``I'm not going to do anything to hurt the vice president,'' he
said, adding that the only negative impact on Bush's presidential
campaign is that ``a lot of people ask him questions about this,
which takes up time to answer which ought to be reserved for
answers on the issues.''
   Meese said he stays ``in pretty close touch'' with the people
who advise President Reagan on public opinion polls and would
``take into account'' poll data ``on whether I am damaging the
president.''
   Meese told the congressmen a report in the next few weeks by an
independent counsel who has been investigating Meese since May 11,
1987, ``will clear him completely,'' said Rep. Cass Ballenger,
R-N.C., who attended the meeting. The report is expected to raise
questions about Meese's ethical behavior, but participants said
that issue didn't come up in the discussion.

   Two teen-agers _ one convicted of murder and
the other of dealing cocaine _ escaped from a youth detention
center outside the nation's capital, but the drug dealer was
recaptured a short time later, officials said.
   District of Columbia Human Services spokeswoman Rae Parr-Moore
said the two 17 year olds may have had outside help in their escape
Wednesday, since the fence at the Oak Hill youth center just
outside the District had been cut open from the outside.
   Oak Hill houses 155 juvenile felons from the District of
Columbia.
   Parr-Moore said the teens had been on their way to a training
exercise when they escaped through a two-foot hole in the fence.
They were discovered missing at about 9 a.m. EDT, Parr-Moore said.
   U.S. Park Police said Rashawan Gatlin was arrested later
Wednesday, but the other escapee, Fernando Smith, remained at large.
   Park Police Sergeant Karl Ore said the teens had been spotted in
an allegedly stolen car at early afternoon on the
Baltimore-Washington parkway, but that one ``bailed out of the
car'' to avoid being recaptured.

   Jesse Jackson took Michael Dukakis to task
over budget matters and South Africa, but he emerged from a meeting
with his Democratic presidential rival saying that the two are
``keenly aware of our joint responsibility to our party.''
   The two aired a few disagreements during a debate Wednesday
night, but spent far more time talking about matters they agreed on.
   Jackson was campaigning in California today. In recent days, he
has been stumping hard in the state, which holds its primary June 7.
   Jackson also had stops planned later today in New Mexico, which
holds its primary the same day as California's.
   During the one-hour debate in San Francisco, Jackson pressed
Dukakis for details about his budget plan. In response, Dukakis
said trying to formulate a detailed budget plan so far in advance
would be ``a serious mistake.''
   Jackson kept pressing him, however, saying that ``the governor
is laying out a budget of promises but not a budget of numbers.''
   When Jackson asked Dukakis if he would use military force
against South Africa, the Massachusetts governor replied that he
would press for more effective sanctions.
   Dukakis later added, ``Yes, one aspect of a tough anti-terrorist
policy is the use of military force against terrorist base camps.
But there are many ways to attack terrorism.''
   But Jackson reserved his toughest comments for criticism of the
Reagan administration's dealings with Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega. The debate came hours after Secretary of State
George P. Shultz announced that talks aimed at getting Noriega to
step down had collapsed.
   Jackson mocked the administration's efforts to negotiate with
the military leader.
   ``All we really know is, there was this courtship of Noriega by
the administration. ... There was marriage to Noriega, putting him
on the payroll ... There was a divorce. And then there was the
bargain to patch up the marriage,'' Jackson said. ``Now we're being
discredited in a failed policy.''
   Earlier Wednesday, he made a speech criticizing administration
policy in Central America.
   ``The $10 billion spent chasing 3 million Sandinistas ... that
money should have been spent chasing poverty, illiteracy and
disease and building houses ... in Central America,'' Jackson said.
``It was immoral and illegal and a misappropriation of funds.''
   The Democratic contender helped load food and medical supplies
onto a truck bound for Central America.
   After the debate, Jackson met privately with Dukakis, and spoke
of the need to ``keep expanding our coalition.'' He also joked they
had talked about ``trying to balance my ticket with a
conservative.''
   Jackson said the two also discussed party unity.
   ``We are keenly aware of our joint responsibility to keep
expanding our party ... (and build) a strong coalition.''

<TEXT>
   A few years ago, an oft-told story goes, a city
traffic cop had somehow obtained a hand-held radar gun and decided
to test it by clocking the speeding motorcade of then-Soviet leader
Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   As the Communist Party chief's shiny black ZIL limousine, two
others bearing bodyguards and a pair of Volga sedans flashed onto
the horizon of Kutuzovsky Prospekt, the officer aimed the detector
at the fast-approaching motorcade.
   The radar gun broke as it crashed to the ground, dropped by the
policeman who had been shot between the eyes by sharp-shooting
secret police agents who guard the Soviet leader.
   The story cannot be verified and may well be apochryphal, as
radar traps are still rare in the Soviet capital. But the armed
guards who ride in the leader's motorcade, with their gun barrels
poised low in the open car windows, are reputed to be expert
riflemen.
   And the tale of the hapless policeman surfaces whenever talk
turns to security around the Kremlin leader.
   Protection of the current ruler or visiting dignitaries is more
effectively ensured in a police state, where the untold legions of
secret agents keep a close eye on known troublemakers and are less
encumbered than their Western counterparts by rules protecting
citizens' civil rights.
   The risk of a terrorist strike against Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev or President Reagan during their May 29-June 2 meetings
here is probably lower than in just about any other country of the
world. But the measures taken to protect them will be no less
visible than in the most dangerous spots on the globe.
   Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin was wounded in a 1918
assassination attempt, inspiring development of a security force
around the leader that strengthened during the nearly three decades
that dictator Jos ef V. Stalin was in power.
   No other attempts on the life of the leader have been
documented, although there have been rumors about several,
including against Gorbachev.
   Gun ownership has been forbidden here since the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution that brought the Soviets to power, and illegal
possession of firearms carries a five-year prison term. Soviets are
even prohibited from carrying hunting knives without special
permits attesting that the potential weapons are part of a national
costume or for actual use while hunting.
   Secrecy surrounds most of the movements of the Soviet leader and
his guests, with exact departure and arrival times for trips
outside the capital kept secret from all but the uppermost echelon
of power. When the official Tass news agency announces that
Gorbachev will visit a Western nation, it usually specifies only in
which half of the month the trip will take place.
   The first indication that the Soviet leader has left the capital
for his summer vacation is often the arrival of paving crews on
Kutuzovsky Prospekt, the route regularly traveled by the leader to
and from the Kremlin.
   Traffic in both directions of Kutuzovsky is forced to the outer
lanes when top officials or state guests travel the broad
thoroughfare, while the privileged center lane is left clear for
the VIPs. As the leader approaches, traffic lights along the route
are switched to green by policemen who man the controls in
miniature, glass-enclosed control towers overlooking the central
streets.
   Most of the meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev will take
place within the heavily fortified Kremlin. Vehicles can enter only
through two archways, with dozens of armed KGB guards in sight and
others likely at the ready behind the historic fortress' crenelated
russet walls.
   If Reagan chooses to make an impromptu stop among the crowds of
Soviets lined up along the streets to greet him, as Gorbachev did
during his Washington stay, the president's own Secret Service
agents will keep a wary eye on the flock of flag-waving welcomers.
   One of Reagan's Secret Service agents was asked during the
Washington summit whether the superpowers' two squads of bodyguards
are able to work well together.
   He replied that their work styles were so similar, ``It's like
they're working out of our manual.''
   Gorbachev's bodyguards often resemble Reagan's in appearance as
well as demeanor. The tall, well-dressed men, with their trim
haircuts and tiny earphones connected to two-way radios, are
quickly identifiable during the leader's televised talks with
Soviet citizens. They encircle Gorbachev and face away from him,
silently scanning the crowd for suspicious movement.
   Security has always been tight around the Soviet leader, but the
net has pulled in even closer over the past two years.
   Rumors of an assassination attempt spread through the capital
after Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, visited the southern Russian
city of Krasnodar in September 1986. Both appeared on television a
few days after their return looking tan and fit, but the number of
bodyguards more than doubled at that time, and screenings of
reporters and onlookers at public events intensified.
   Metal detectors are rarely used in the Soviet Union but have
been appearing recently as security for Gorbachev appearances. And
uniformed police at the entrances to virtually all public buildings
closely check visitors' credentials and search purses and camera
bags before permitting entry.
   When reporters are allowed into the Kremlin for photo sessions
or political meetings, they must clear a dozen security checkpoints
before entering the room in which the session is to take place.
   During Reagan's visit to Moscow, the routine will likely
intensify as the Soviet hosts seek to preserve their image as a
country rarely touched by terrorism.

   A flight mechanic who stole a private jet and
killed himself after a 1,600-mile joyride was ``upbeat'' until the
moment his radio went silent, says the pilot who talked him through
a safe landing.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Bob Cunningham, who helped his former
co-worker, Mike Christiansen, 24, land the plane at Stapleton
International Airport on Wednesday. ``The thing that stays in my
mind is that he did take his life after all that.''
   Within minutes of the relatively routine landing, police, FBI
agents and emergency crew members who approached the twin-engine
Learjet 36a found Christiansen dead at the controls of a gunshot
wound.
   ``As the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached, he
was ordered to lock his brakes,'' said Stapleton spokesman Richard
Boulware. ``They heard a noise and when they looked in the cockpit,
they found him dead. Things happened really fast.''
   The FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration have begun
investigations to find out why Christiansen stole the 10-seat jet
from Patrick Henry International Airport in Newport News, Va., why
he killed himself, and where he obtained the gun.
   ``The indication was that he just wanted to fly around for
awhile,'' Boulware said.
   Christiansen, who did not have pilot's license, worked as a
flight mechanic at the Virginia airport for the Atlanta-based
Flight International, which owned the plane he stole, officials
said. The company operates the world's largest fleet of Learjets.
   Pete Daikos, spokesman for Patrick Henry airport, said
Christiansen took off early Wednesday, clipping a security guard's
van on a runway and shearing off part of a wingtip fuel tank. The
guard escaped injury.
   Cunningham, 42, who worked with Christiansen at International
Jet Aviation Services in Denver last year, said he was preparing
for a flight from Denver to his hometown of Albuquerque, N.M., when
air traffic control officials asked for his help in landing the jet.
   ``He was upbeat on the radio, and responded readily. I asked him
several times how he was doing, and he came back and said he was
doing fine,'' said Cunningham. At one point, he asked Christiansen
how he was and Christiansen replied, ``Feeling great.''
   After Christiansen landed, Cunningham asked, ``Are you OK, Mike?
Mike, are you OK? Have you got that thing shut down yet?'' There
was no reply, and, Boulware said, Christiansen was found dead
moments later.
   Christiansen apparently grew up in Colorado and attended
Colorado Aerotech in Broomfield last year. He was certified by the
FAA to work on aircraft in June.
   International Jet officials said he worked as ``aircraft cleaner
and helper'' for about 10 months, resigning in August to take a job
with Continental Airlines. In March, he moved to Virginia.
   Cunningham recalled Christiansen as a ``very personable'' man,
who sometimes acted as his chauffeur during his stops at Stapleton.
   ``I believe he was in school at the time, training to be a
flight mechanic and that was on his mind, of course,'' Cunningham
said. ``He did the job well, to my knowledge.''
   Cunningham said he did not know why Christiansen stole the
plane. ``We didn't have time to go into too much background,'' he
said. ``We wanted to get the plane down safely.''
   Attempts to reach Christiansen's family members by telephone at
the Lakewood address Christiansen gave the FAA were unsuccessful.
The Associated Press made 30 calls to the apartment complex where
he lived in Virginia and found only one resident at home. She said
she never had heard of him.

   The freewheeling Chinese city of Canton is
bucking a national trend of canceling beauty pageants by going
ahead this week with a contest to select top models, a pro-Beijing
newspaper reported today.
   About 5,000 people braved the rain and packed a city sports
stadium Wednesday night to watch judges whittle a field of 30 men
and women to a final 15 who will compete for the titles of ``Miss
Canton'' and ``Mr. Canton'' on Saturday, the Chinese-language Wen
Wei Po said.
   Shanghai and Beijing are among the Chinese cities to cancel
planned beauty contests. Typically, local leaders have said
``conditions are not ripe'' for pageants in a country with a low
standard of living.
   Authorities in Canton, the capital of Guangdong province just 90
miles from the British colony of Hong Kong, decided to allow the
completion of the ``Canton Television Model Competition'' because
it already is in its final phase.
   But the report said local media were instructed to play down the
event and the organizing television station scrapped plans to
televise the contest live. Provincial and city officials invited to
the competition on Wednesday night also did not show up, the
newspaper said.
   The report quoted members of the audience telling reporters that
Cantonese people are able to accept beauty pageants because their
area opened up to the outside world earlier than the rest of China.
   The region is one of the country's most prosperous and has been
relatively successful in attracting foreign investment.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer celebrated his
90th birthday at a Gala Kennedy Center concert which ended with
Hammer conducting the National Symphony Orchestra in John Phillip
Sousa's ``Stars and Stripes Forever.''
   Music Director Mstislav Rostropovich handed over his baton
Wednesday night moments after Hammer announced he was giving
$250,000 to the orchestra. More than 3,000 well-wishers filled the
center's Concert Hall to celebrate the birthday of the
philanthropist, art collector and chairman of Occidental Petroleum
Corp.
   During the concert, Hammer sat in the President's Box with his
wife, Frances, and Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin.
   The audience included high-ranking government officials, members
of Congress, diplomats and leaders of the business and arts
communities, as well as Lady Bird Johnson, widow of former
President Lyndon Baines Johnson.
   Mounting the stage after the concert, Hammer said his dream of
creating ``a meaningful peace in the world is closer to reality
than ever before.'' He predicted that the Moscow summit talks
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will be a ``tremendous success.''
   ``I believe the die has been cast for realistic negotiations
that will lead to a new period of understanding and respect between
the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Hammer said.
   Hammer has been close to a long succession of Soviet leaders and
has struck trade deals with the Soviets for many years. He also is
chairman of the president's Cancer Board and has spent millions of
dollars on medical research aimed at finding a cancer cure.
   He proposed that a ``March of Dollars'' similar to the March of
Dimes against polio begun 50 years ago be held to accelerate cancer
research. He said he is lobbying congressional leaders to back
matching government funds for $500 million in private money to be
given to the National Cancer Institute over four years.
   Hammer shared the stage with members of the National Symphony
and Wednesday night's guest artists: violinists Yehudi Menuhin and
Isaac Stern, soprano Kiri Te Kanawa and Chinese pianist Yuhui Hong,
who made her U.S. debut at the concert.

this year from his little cannery in the western Maine foothills.
   Wells, who hates to see a thriving dandelion go to waste, talks
about the plant with fondness, respect and knowledge. The roots, he
explains, can be made into herbal tea; the bright, yellow blossoms
can be pickled or made into wine and jelly; the leaves are
excellent cooked or served fresh in salads.
   ``And the stem, you use that to siphon gas out of someone's
car,'' Wells deadpans. He admits he has grown weary of offers of
dandelions from homeowners plagued by the hearty, prolific weeds.
   Wells sees dandelions' tendency to grow back after being
snipped, a trait that frustrates gardeners, as another plus. Five
days after the last batch of foot-high dandelions was harvested,
new shoots appeared.
   Wells' W.S. Wells and Son cannery was founded 102 years ago by
his grandfather, Walter Scott Wells. The barn-size factory also
packages beans and cans beet greens and a vegetative delicacy known
as fiddleheads.
   Fiddleheads, named for their deep-green stems that are
gracefully curled a couple of inches from the ground before they
sprout into ostrich ferns in swampy, northern woodlands in late
spring, make up the bulk of the products bearing Wells' Belle of
Maine label. His only competition comes from canners in Canada,
where fiddleheads also are popular.
   While fiddleheads are best known to New Englanders, who gather
them with ritualistic zeal in late spring, they have a few
scattered devotees as far away as California. Wells, 52, also ships
fiddleheads to fashionable restaurants in New York and
Philadelphia, ``and I do a whale of a business in Boston.''
   The Four Seasons restaurant in New York serves 300 pounds of
fresh fiddleheads a week in the spring, and features a soft shell
crab and fiddlehead combination as one of its ``signature dishes,''
said purchaser Bob Menge.
   ``It's a unique type of vegetable _ I don't even know if you
call it a vegetable,'' said Menge. ``It's got a wonderful flavor to
me, sort of between a string bean and asparagus.''
   Wells loves to eat fiddleheads, even though he can't quite pin
down what gives them appeal.
   ``There isn't that much flavor to a fiddlehead,'' said Wells,
who likes them salted and slathered with butter or served in one of
his wife's fiddlehead quiches. ``To me, it tastes like a
fiddlehead.''
   Wells' company also pickles fiddleheads and dandelions.
   The harvest is now in full swing. While Wells cultivates and
harvests the monstrous dandelions that grow in neat rows on his
land, he hires up to 200 pickers, from children to a woman in her
70s, to gather the young ferns from secret patches all over Maine,
and in parts of Vermont and New York.
   Wells compared fiddlehead pickers to sport fishermen. ``When
they find a good spot, they keep it a secret.''
   This season, Wells expects to can at least 1,200 cases plus ship
15 tons of fresh fiddleheads to market. As the canning season
peaked in late May, some cannery workers had been on the job for
nearly 20 straight days.
   Pat Stanley, who trims the stems and cleans a brown, flaky skin
from fiddleheads before they are washed, blanched and canned, said
she has been working ``pretty near seven days a week.''
   Adrian R. Wells Jr., the 22-year-old manager of the plant and
the fourth generation of the family of canners, said he had just
finished working 22 straight 14-hour days when his wife gave birth
to their first son.
   ``I'm tired as hell,'' he said as he loaded armfuls of
fiddleheads into a bin for cleaning.

<HEAD>France Explodes Nuclear Bomb In South Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France today detonated its
biggest nuclear test since 1985 in the South Pacific, exploding a
bomb equivalent to 80,000 tons of dynamite, scientists said.
   The underground test, on Mururoa atoll, was the second this year
and the 97th in a series started in 1975 when France abandoned
atmospheric testing in the South Pacific, said Warwick Smith,
director of the Seismological Observatory in Wellington.
   Scientists at New Zealand's monitoring station in Raratonga,
Cooks Islands, recorded the blast at 5:01 a.m. (11:01 a.m. EDT
Wednesday), saying it was an 80-kiloton bomb.
   It was the largest French test on Mururoa since May 1985, when
France detonated a 90-kiloton bomb. France set off a 20-kiloton
blast on Mururoa on May 12. Six more tests are expected this year.
   France as a matter of policy does not comment on reports of its
testing.
   Foreign Minister Russell Marshall condemned the latest test,
noting the program is continuing against strong opposition from
countries in the region.
   ``I am seriously concerned about continued French nuclear
testing in the South Pacific,'' said Marshall, who is also minister
for disarmament. ``There can be no doubt that continued French
nuclear testing in the South Pacific is disquieting to the
region,'' he said in a statement.
   Marshall said it was ironic that French testing had brought
South Pacific countries closer together, culminating in a decision
to declare the region a nuclear-free zone.
   He said it would be a ``profound relief'' to countries of the
South Pacific if France signed protocols to the treaty and ceased
testing.

   The Organization of African Unity
marked its silver jubilee with a declaration promising more help
for the military overthrow of South Africa and the independence
struggle in Namibia.
   The declaration, released Wednesday, said the OAU would achieve
such goals through a renewed commitment to ``unity, solidarity,
liberation and development'' although it offered no new plans of
action.
   Earlier Wednesday, President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, the
outgoing OAU chairman, celebrated the organization's 25th
anniversary with a chorus of ``Happy Birthday, OAU,'' as he cut a
cake.
   African leaders planted trees and unveiled a marble plaque with
gold engraving of the organization's anniversay theme: Unity,
Solidarity, Liberation, Development.
   Groups from Sudan, Zambia, Guinea and Algeria danced and sang.
   Security was light for the more than 30 heads of government and
state gathered at the 50-member body's headquarters in the capital
of Addis Ababa. The celebration will be followed by a three-day
summit beginning today.
   Many of the 40 points in the 11-page declaration repeated the
original objectives of the OAU's founding fathers, voiced in Addis
Ababa 25 years ago.
   The declaration highlighted a renewed commitment to bring about
the early independence of Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,
and to eradicate South Africa's policy of race segregation, called
apartheid.
   Namibia is under South Africa's control.
   The declaration reaffirmed ``the primacy of the armed struggle
and resolve to increase financial, material and military assistance
to the national liberation movemments.''
   However, money might be a problem. Thirty-four of the
organization's members owe the OAU's liberation fund a total of $12
million.
   The declaration repeated a commitment to the imposition of
comprehensive, mandatory sanctions against South Africa's white-led
government and urged international support for such sanctions.
   It did not say, however, how it would impose the sanctions on
many of its members who do about $1 billion of trade each year with
the apartheid state.
   The declaration noted with grave concern continued acts of
aggression by South Africa against its neighbors and reaffirmed the
OAU's commitment to provide financial and material help to
strengthen their defenses.
   The declaration also expressed support for recent Angolan peace
talks involving top officials of Cuba, South Africa and Angola.

   Midway through the 15-day strike wave that
ended this month, tentative agreement was at hand for the communist
leadership's architect of economic reform to meet with Solidarity
chief Lech Walesa.
   But the promise of the first direct contact in six years between
prominent opposition leaders and authorities went unfulfilled when
Walesa joined a strike at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk.
   Now, there are signs such talks may actually be in the offing.
   The ``thread of dialogue'' may actually have a better chance
because of the strikes, Ryszard Wojna, a leading communist deputy
in Parliament, was quoted as saying in this week's issue of the
official newspaper Odrodzenie (Rebirth).
   Senior communist leaders are encouraging talk of an
``anti-crisis pact'' by which the opposing camps would agree on and
unite behind a program to breathe life into a lethargic economy.
   The idea was raised by historian Bronislaw Geremek, a close
adviser to Walesa, in an interview published in February by the
official press. Publication of an interview with such a prominent
opposition figure was in itself an unusual event.
   Spurring the renewed search for dialogue is the sense that the
impasse that has prevailed since a 1981 military crackdown on the
Solidarity independent labor federation cannot continue forever.
   Poland's economic crisis is especially acute and the
government's attempt to institute reforms has won scant public
support.
   Authorities have raised prices 45 percent this year and say they
plan to reduce central management of the economy and encourage more
free enterprise. But, according to one recent public opinion poll,
just 7 percent of the public believes the program will succeed.
   A pact on reform with the opposition, which demands a voice in
shaping it, could improve its chances and encourage the assistance
of Western lenders.
   Although it is not clear who would speak to whom, the idea for
an ``anti-crisis pact'' appears to be gaining advocates within
official circles. And Walesa said on Tuesday that the idea is being
considered by Solidarity.
   Earlier this month, Politburo member Alfred Miodowicz, leader of
the official unions created after Solidarity was outlawed in 1982,
said he would not rule out meeting Walesa if it would improve the
public mood.
   Walesa last met with a senior government official during his
post-martial law internment in March 1982.
   Wojna said in the Odrodzenie interview that he envisioned that
Deputy Prime Minister Zdzislaw Sadowski, the government's architect
of reform, and a team of party economic experts would meet with a
dozen or so opposition representatives.
   Wojna said such a meeting could be successful if ``all
propaganda, demagogy and mutual prejudices'' were left in the
cloakroom.
   He said the canceled meeting of Sadowski and Walesa had
represented a ``thin thread (of dialogue), but still it indicated
the direction of thinking.''
   Sadowski's spokesman, Jerzy Malkowski, said on Wednesday that
Sadowski's attitude toward such a meeting is ``still the same _
open.''
   And chief government spokesman Jerzy Urban told his weekly news
conference on Tuesday that ``one certainly can expect further
active striving for talks and cooperation'' with the opposition.
   Asked specifically about a meeting between Sadowski and Walesa,
he said it was not possible at present but, ``The future will show
how it will go.''
   From his home in Gdansk, Walesa responded: ``I have said that
they would come to us on their knees. And they will, sooner or
later. My problem now is whether I should wait until they do or
not.''
   Reinstatement of independent Solidarity locals was a key demand
by participants in most of the five major strikes that began April
25 and ended May 10. It was championed with the greatest vigor by
strikers at the Gdansk shipyard, who ended their stoppage
peacefully but without resolution, and the Lenin steelworks outside
Krakow, whose strike security forces crushed.
   Poland is afflicted with a $39 billion foreign debt, climbing
inflation, low wages and lack of capital to overhaul its outmoded
industrial plant.
   The government's economic reform progam aims to decrease
bureaucracy, encourage private and managerial enterprise, reduce
central planning and make the economy more market-oriented. But
implementation has been slow.
   Solidarity supports the program's direction, but says it is
doomed to fail unless the government enters a dialogue with
opposition groups.
   Three times in postwar Poland, price increases have led to labor
unrest that has toppled governments.

   Evan Mecham's defense attorney says he's
surprised that lawyers were able to find enough acceptable jurors
for the ousted governor's criminal trial.
   A 24-member panel was made final Wednesday after two days of
juror questioning in Maricopa County Superior Court. This
afternoon, prosecution and defense lawyers were to eliminate six
members each to assemble the final eight-member jury with four
alternates.
   Opening statements were scheduled for June 2 in the trial of the
former governor and his brother, Willard, on charges of concealing
a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham defense lawyer Michael Scott said he was surprised that
enough acceptable panelists were found because of the extensive
publicity surrounding the case.
   ``I really didn't know what to expect,'' Scott said.
   The jurors and alternates are to be sworn in Friday, Superior
Court Judge Michael Dann ruled.
   Mecham could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted of all
six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false
documents. Willard Mecham, who was his brother's 1986 campaign
treasurer, faces three similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison
if convicted.
   The former Republican governor was removed from office April 4
when the Senate convicted him on two unrelated impeachment counts.
He also had been impeached in connection with the $350,000 loan,
but the Senate did not hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his
criminal trial.
   Thirteen of 37 possible jurors questioned during two days were
eliminated for showing signs of bias or personal conflicts.
   Mecham, asked whether he was pleased with the jury pool, joked
that he would have liked to include several of those who were
eliminated, but he declined to comment further.
   Mecham and his brother have denied all wrongdoing in their
failure to list the $350,000 loan from a Tempe developer on
financial reports required by the state. They contended it was
properly reported as part of a $465,000 lump sum listed as a
contribution from Mecham.
   On June 1, the Arizona Supreme Court is to hear oral arguments
on a defense motion to return the charges to the state grand jury
for a new determination of probable causee.
   Among the jurors struck from the pool by the prosecutor was a
woman who said Tuesday she thought Mecham's personality was one of
``arrogance, of sureness of himself'' and that he had an inability
to admit error.
   One woman accepted for the panel said she believed Mecham was
honest, adding, ``I like the man. I had nothing against him as
governor.''

   The dollar closed moderately higher today against
the Japanese yen in Tokyo following its overnight advance in New
York, while share prices fell back to remain little changed after
an initial surge in early trading.
   After opening at 124.35 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
finish, the dollar climbed further, closing the day at 124.50 yen,
up 0.20 yen.
   ``The dollar stayed in narrow range from 124.35 to 124.53 yen,
sandwiched between buying and selling orders by speculators,'' said
a foreign exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Participants stayed away from placing major orders in
anticipation of the release of U.S. first-quarter gross national
product figures due out later in the day, he said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues slipped a modest 15.41 points, or 0.05 percent, to
end the day's trading at 27,428.24.
   ``The market made a good start on the two consecutive rallies
led by large-capital issues, such as steels and heavy industries.
But it soon lost the strength as investors turned to selling to
take profits,'' said a stock analyst with a major securities house,
speaking anonymously.
   Activity slowed in the afternoon session as trading in
large-capital issues tailed off, and the market lost ground
steadily throughout most of the remaining day, traders said.
   The Nikkei index had gained 207.84 points to 27,641.49 early in
the morning session. On Tuesday and Wednesday the stock market's
key barometer had gained a total of 193.89 points.
   Among the losers were steels, non-ferrous metals and
electricals. Drugs and textiles, as well as securities and
insurances also lost ground. Certain machineries and papers were
bought.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares,
down from the 1.5 billion shares which changed hands on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Hamish Hamilton, A Leading British Publisher, Dies At Age 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American-born Hamish Hamilton, a leading British
publisher for 50 years, died in London after a long illness, his
family announced today. He was 87.
   Hamilton, who died Tuesday, founded the London publishing house
Hamish Hamilton Ltd. in 1931.
   He enjoyed the company of writers, ran his company on autocratic
lines, distrusted computers and sales directors, and always had to
see for himself.
   Hamilton was an intrepid flyer of small planes and, when he
published Jacques Cousteau's ``The Silent World'' in 1953, he
characteristically went diving with the undersea explorer.
   He once worked two weeks selling books in Harrods, the London
department store, and only admitted defeat when he failed to sell a
Hamilton book to a store detective.
   In 1926, after serving an apprenticeship at the London
publishers Jonathan Cape, Hamilton became London manager for the
American publishers Harper and Brothers.
   His first bestseller after founding Hamish Hamilton Ltd. with
his entire capital of $40,000 was John Gunther's ``Inside Europe.''
   Over the years, Hamilton published authors including Dean
Acheson, Luigi Barzini, Albert Camus, Truman Capote, Raymond
Chandler, John Kenneth Galbraith, John Hersey, Walter Lippmann, Ed
McBain, J.D. Salinger, Jean-Paul Sartre, A.J.P. Taylor, James
Thurber and Alexander Werth.
   He sold Hamish Hamilton Ltd. to Thomson Publications Ltd. in
1965, though continuing on as chairman until 1981. Four years
later, Thomson sold Hamish Hamilton Ltd. to the giant publishing
company Viking-Penguin.
   Hamilton was born in Indianapolis, Ind., of a Scottish father,
James Hamilton, and an American mother, Alice van Valkenburg, but
was brought up mainly by relations in Scotland.
   He was educated at Rugby, one of Britain's top private schools,
and at Cambridge University, where he studied modern languages and
became one of Britain's top oarsmen.
   Hamilton qualified as a lawyer and later became an honorary
attache at the British Embassy in Washington, which gave him a
lifelong interest in Anglo-American relations.
   When World War II broke out, he joined the Army and served in
France and the Netherlands before being transferred to the U.S.
division of the Ministry of Information.
   Hamilton is survived by his second wife, Countess Yvonne
Pallavicino of Rome, and their son Alastair, an author and
translator.

<HEAD>Safety Commission to Ban Most Lawn Darts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission has
voted to ban most lawn darts, saying the pointed metal toys present
a danger of death or serious injury.
   Lawn darts, which have long metal tips, have become popular as a
yard game. They are tossed through the air, with the player trying
to sticking the points into the ground in or near a target.
   Three children, aged 4, 7 and 13, have been killed in accidents
involving the darts in recent years, according to commission
records. In addition, an estimated 670 lawn-dart injuries are
treated annually at hospital emergency rooms.
   The ban, voted Wednesday, now goes back to the commission staff
to develop a formal rulemaking to enforce the ban and to solicit
comment from the public before being returned to the commissioners
for a vote on a final ban, likely in late summer or fall.

   Many of the nation's pollution-fighters at the
headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency have been
gasping and wheezing from an air pollution problem apparently
caused by new carpeting.
   Sixty-five employees have sought medical attention and seven
can't enter the building at all because of their reactions when
they do, William Hirzy, president-elect of Local 2050 of the
National Federation of Federal Employees, said Wednesday.
   Hirzy said he was ``90 percent certain'' the reactions came from
exposure to phenylcyclohexene, a gas given off by the backing of
new rugs the agency has been installing in the building used by
5,100 employees.
   The agency has stopped putting in new carpets, but Charles
Grizzle, assistant administrator for administration, said
phenylcyclohexene had not been fixed definitely as the cause of the
problem and ``I don't see any reason to rip up the carpets until we

<HEAD>U.S. Government Opens Another Front in Oranges Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is trying on another front to
boost sales American oranges and orange juice in Japan.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Wednesday
that he has accepted a Florida citrus industry petition for a
formal investigation of Japanese restrictions on orange and juice
imports as unfair trade practices.
   The restrictions include import quotas and a requirement that
imported juice be blended with home-grown juice.
   Yeutter's office already is pursuing the orange dispute at other
levels. After months of unsuccessful negotiations with the Japanese
government, it moved earlier this month to have the Japanese orange
import quotas _ along with those on beef imports _ declared illegal
under international trading rules by GATT, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.

<HEAD>Budget Cuts Could Kill Space Station, Says NASA Head</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Proposed deep cuts in NASA's budget
could kill America's space station, reducing the nation to a
second- or third-rate space power, the space agency's head warns.
   ``Without the space station, the U.S. manned space flight
program would be dead-ended, and America's leadership in space
would be put on hold indefinitely,'' James C. Fletcher said
Wednesday as he spoke to a group of reporters attending briefings
on U.S. space goals.
   The Reagan administration has asked Congress to give NASA $11.5
billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, an increase of 27
percent over the current budget.
   However, key lawmakers have said the agency can expect no more
than $10.7 billion. A House budget resolution would slash that to
$10.2 billion.
   The administration has asked for $967 million to continue space
station development. Earlier cuts already have delayed the program
three years. Current plans call for putting people in the orbiting
laboratory in late 1995.
   Fletcher, speaking from Washington, said that if the budget were
reduced to $10.2 billion, ``NASA would have to recommend killing
the space station.''
   The result, he said, could be reduction of the United States
``to a second-rate or even a third-rate power in space.''
   Fletcher said the station is needed to support space research
and to prepare humans for deeper excursions into space, perhaps to
build a moon base or to mount an expedition to Mars.
   Asked how much money it would take to continue the space station
next year, the administrator replied, ``The House has reported out
$900 million. Unless we get close to that figure, I wonder if it
would be worth going ahead with the space station.''
   Fletcher said most members of Congress favor a strong space
program, ``but when it comes to balancing the space station with
their favorite programs in the present budget climate, it is a hard
choice to make.''
   He said cancellation of the space station would have a
``devastating'' effect on the space programs of the Europeans and
the Canadians, who have invested $1 billion, and are planning to
double that, to develop modules and other equipment for the U.S.
facility.
   Fletcher said a steep budget reduction would also lead to a drop
in the number of space shuttle flights after launches resume, now
scheduled for late August. NASA plans seven launches next year,
building up to 14 a year by 1994.
   He said the Soviets have been gathering valuable flight
experience over several years with their Salyut space station and
with the new Mir station.
   ``There is no doubt the Russians are far ahead of us in moving
out into space,'' Fletcher said.

<HEAD>Computer Whiz Kid Hospitalized With Mother After Assets Seized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old computer whiz and his
mother apparently tried to commit suicide after authorities closed
the budding millionaire's company and seized its assets, police say.
   Tex Zachary Hildreth and his 50-year-old mother, Rose, were in
serious condition today at Elliot Hospital, said nursing supervisor
Laurie King.
   Hildreth left the Braintree, Mass., area just before his
5-year-old computer services company, Massdata Corp., was closed by
authorities and its assets were seized Tuesday. He left behind
about 30 angry employees and irked investors.
   Hildreth was arrested as a fugitive here Tuesday after a Holiday
Inn employee called police to report a bloodied man wandering in
the lobby. Police found Hildreth's mother lying injured in the room
the two shared.
   Police Lt. William Bovaird said it appeared Hildreth may have
slashed his wrists. A bottle of non-prescription pills was found in
the hotel room, along with what appeared to be suicide notes,
Bovaird said.
   Both Hildreths were incoherent, the lieutenant said.
   Massdata was closed Monday when the Rockland Trust Co., which
was owed more than $400,000, tried to seize its assets, said Senior
Vice President John O'Connor.
   Norfolk County, Mass., authorities and state police secured
Massdata's offices Tuesday night.
   The county district attorney's office began investigating
Hildreth on Tuesday after receiving complaints from several people
who said they did business with him, said spokesman Mike McGorty.
   Police in the Boston suburb of Weymouth charged Hildreth with
larceny of more than $250 on the same day after receiving another
complaint, McGorty said. Hildreth collapsed in his office on his
24th birthday May 18, suffering what was described as an aneurysm,
a dangerous weakening of a blood vessel. His father died of an
aneurysm when Hildreth was 7.
   Employees became suspicious last Friday when Massdata's
president told them their paychecks were being withheld because
Hildreth had not signed them. McGorty said the investigation into
Hildreth's business dealings was expected to be lengthy.
   But there were signs of unusual behavior before this week. The
Boston Herald reported Wednesday that Hildreth often tried to trick
employees into believing that New York real estate tycoon Donald
Trump called to chat.
   Employees said Hildreth would disguise his voice and call
himself, pretending to be Trump, then would leave the office door
open as he conducted an imaginary conversation.
   Hildreth transformed himself from an overweight, unhappy
teen-ager into a budding millionaire just a few years out of high
school, according to a profile last month in The Boston Globe.
   After buying his first computer at age 16, he began writing
computer programs. The confidence he gained prompted him to lose
115 pounds in less than two years.
   With the help of a mentor in the Braintree area, Hildreth rented
office space at the age of 20 and went into business as a computer
consultant. He gradually built up his business, hiring young
computer experts from other companies.
   Hildreth rapidly acquired symbols of success: a $220,000
Weymouth condominium, a $32,000 BMW and a 50-inch, $4,000 color TV.
   His mother, who once lived with him in subsidized housing and
worked as a lunch matron at his school, was made clerk of the
company.
   The company had more than 300 clients, an employee told the
Herald.
   Massdata turned profitable in 1987 and predicted sales of about
$4 million this year, the Globe said.
   Last November, Hildreth, accompanied by a beautiful woman,
arrived in a limousine for the fifth reunion of his Braintree High
School class.
   ``This was my revenge for four years of hell,'' he said at the
time.

<HEAD>LA County Approves Plan for Nation's First Fully Automated Trolley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation officials in this
traffic-clogged region have approved a 20-mile railway they say
would be the nation's first fully automated, driverless trolley
line.
   The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission unanimously
adopted the proposal Wednesday despite a critic's contention that
the system would be ``bureaucrat-friendly, technology-friendly but
not user-friendly.''
   ``What turned me around was other successful (automated)
systems'' that have worked ``astoundingly well,' said Commissioner
Jacki Bacharach, who heads the commission's rail construction
committee and has studied such lines in London, Vancouver, British
Columbia and Lille, France.
   Commission Chairman Pete Schabarum said the automated system is
``a technology whose time has come,'' and he called for ``a
commitment for automation throughout the system from now on.''
   The project requires a $50 million investment above the $344
million that was originally estimated for the 20-mile line along
the Century Freeway between El Segundo and Norwalk, which is about
10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   Until recently, the commission had intended to use manually
controlled trolleys, which would be powered by overhead wires.
   Commissioner Ray Grabinski said the new system will be the first
fully automated, driverless trolley line in the country.
   Proponents say the driverless system would prove more efficient
by running smaller trains more often and save money by replacing
highly paid operators with lower-paid attendants who would roam the
cars.
   ``More frequent service all day long builds ridership and
farebox revenue,'' Ms. Bacharach said.
   Critics, however, said the automated trolleys would be the third
type of rail car to become part of the county's multibillion dollar
mass transit system, along with cars to be used for the Metro Rail
subway now under construction and a manned light rail system
proposed between Los Angeles and Long Beach.
   None of the cars would be compatible and riders would be forced
to transfer. For example, a commuter going from the San Fernando
Valley to Los Angeles International Airport would have to ride four
lines and transfer three times.
   ``As long as they design it so you have to get on and get off,
it's never going to be user-friendly,'' said state Assemblyman
Richard Katz. ``This is a system that is bureacrat-friendly,
technology-friendly but not user-friendly.''
   However, the compatibility of the trolley with other transit
systems was not viewed as a problem by the commission, said Erica
Goebel, a commission spokeswoman.
   ``Passenger studies show that passengers who have to transfer
from one line to another don't consider that as any kind of a
barrier,'' Ms. Goebel said. ``It's all part of the ride.''

<HEAD>Two More Bodies Unearthed At Golden Temple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more bodies were recovered from the
Golden Temple complex today and police said the victims had been
tortured to death by Sikh radicals, United News of India reported.
   Authorities said more than 20 other corpses could be buried
around the temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   On Wednesday, two human skeletons, one a male and the other
female, were recovered by municipal workers from the complex.
   Amritsar Police Superintendent Baldev Singh said today's remains
were ``people tortured and then killed by Sikh terrorists'' and
said a search was under way for more.
   Sikh extremists waging a guerrilla war for an independent
homeland turned the Golden Temple into an armed camp earlier this
month. The radicals were forced out during a police siege of the
shrine.
   The siege, from May 9 to 18, resulted in the surrender of more
than 200 extremists and sympathizers. More than 46 people died in
the ordeal.
   There had been frequent reports that people were being detained
and tortured by militants inside the shrine. Several people were
reported missing by families after they went to the temple to pray.
   The bodies found today were buried near the dining hall that
stands to the east of the temple. On Wednesday, the bodies were
found to the west of the temple.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed 500 years ago as an alternative
to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by
India's majority Hindus.
   More than 1,150 people have been killed by Sikh extremists in
Punjab state since the start of the year. In 1987, 1,030 people
were killed.
   Indian security forces raided the Golden Temple in 1984, killing
1,200 people, mostly Sikhs. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered
the raid. Two of Mrs. Gandhi's Sikh guards assassinated her five
months later.

<HEAD>Court Examines Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' Broadcast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America, which panicked nearly 50 years ago
when it heard Orson Welles' radio play describing a Martian
invasion, could go gaga again, says the Court of Historical Review.
   The mock court _ featuring a real judge, real attorneys and
bogus witnesses _ convened Wednesday to celebrate the 50th
anniversary year of Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast on
Halloween 1938.
   Municipal Judge George T. Choppelas said he was convinced by the
testimony of a man playing the late Welles, who sat in the witness
chair with his vest stuffed with a pillow.
   ``The broadcast was real and everything else is fiction,''
boomed the ersatz Welles, played by retired drama teacher E. Wyman
Spalding.
   ``Based on what we know, it could happen again,'' said Choppelas.
   The 1938 CBS radio version of H.G. Wells' science fiction
classic was heard by an estimated 6 million Americans, becoming a
landmark of sorts in broadcasting when it provoked mass panic among
listeners who mistook it for a news show.
   Published accounts of the broadcast estimated that nearly 2
million people believed that Martians had actually landed.
   Wednesday's session began with a reconstructed repeat of the
program on tape.
   ``Good heavens,'' gasped a fictitious newsman. ``Something's
wriggling out of the shadows! Ladies and gentlemen, it's
indescribable ...''
   The San Francisco mock court convenes periodically to explore
such weighty topics as whether chicken soup is really Jewish
penicillin.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Autism Results From Prenatal Brain Development
Error</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unfortunate mixup in the growth of the brain
before birth may be responsible for autism, according to research
published today.
   Researchers who made scans of victims' brains found that one
structure buried deep within the head is often poorly developed.
While this may not be the sole cause of autism, it could help
explain many of the weird and stubborn symptoms of this illness.
   Dr. Eric Courchesne and colleagues from Children's Hospital
Research Center in San Diego pinpointed the abnormality in a region
of the cerebellum, which lies at the base of the skull. This
structure helps control movement, learning and some kinds of
behavior.
   ``It supports the idea that this is something that happens early
in development,'' said Dr. Margaret Bauman of Harvard Medical
School.
   Autism usually becomes apparent early in childhood. Victims are
withdrawn and often mute. Frequently they move and walk oddly,
become obsessed with mechanical objects and are overly sensitive to
sounds and other distractions. The disorder occurs in about five of
every 10,000 people.
   Courchesne, whose study was published in the New England Journal
of Medicine, that in some people with autism, a part of the
cerebellum known as the vermis is undersized. He studied 18 people,
and in 14 of them, the vermis was 25 percent smaller than usual.
   He said he believes that the defect exists in a majority of
autistic people and probably occurs before birth as the brain takes
shape inside the womb.
   ``Until this study, it was unknown whether or not autism had an
anatomical or chemical basis,'' Courchesne said. ``This kind of
evidence makes it clear that at least in a substantial subset of
autism, the disorder is, in fact, anatomical.''
   If the newly found abnormality turns out to be a cause of
autism, the discovery could open new approaches for treating the
disorder, which is incurable.
   However, many experts believe that autism is actually a group of
similar-looking diseases, so no single problem is likely to explain
all cases of the disorder.
   ``This is potentially a very important finding, because it would
represent a way to assist the diagnosis and also has implications
as to what might be the cause and the timing of the insult to the
brain,'' said Dr. Edward R. Ritvo of the University of California,
Los Angeles.
   Courchesne said the defect he discovered could be just one of
many injuries suffered by the brains of autistic people before
birth. If so, it might not be the key injury that underlies autism.
   However, he said, ``It is possible that this damage is
responsible for some of the symptoms of autism. The cerebellum is
in a position to disrupt or affect mechanisms involved in attention
and various kinds of learning and to alter the activity of several
major neurotransmitter systems'' of brain chemicals.
   The researchers used magnetic resonance scanning, which produces
cross-section pictures of the head, to pinpoint the difference
between autistic brains and those of normal people.
   Bauman said the defect that Courchesne found is too subtle for
scanning to be used routinely to diagnose autism.
   She and Ritvo also have found abnormalities in specific cells
called Purkinje cells in the brain's of autism victims after death.
   ``I think the cerebellum is playing a role,'' she said. ``But I
think there are other parts of the brain that are also involved,
such as the limbic system, which has something to do with memory. I
hope people will not say that the problem is now solved.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Fred R. Volkmar and Donald J.
Cohen of Yale called the report ``particularly interesting.'' But
they cautioned that the number of patients tested was small, and
their brain defect might not be typical of autism victims.

   The Soviet navy operates close to home in part
because the Kremlin does not trust its sailors and fears defections
by naval personnel, according to the editor of the new ``Jane's
Fighting Ships.''
   Richard Sharpe also said the U.S. Navy is so much stronger than
Western Europe's forces that Washington is finding it harder and
harder to work with its allies at sea.
   The new edition of the prestigious reference book was released
Wednesday.
   Sharpe, a recently retired Royal Navy captain, recalled passing
a Soviet cruiser in the English Channel. He said that while almost
the entire crew of the British warship lined its decks, on the
Soviet vessel just one young sailor was visible above deck.
   ``I don't think the Politburo trusts its navy and that is one of
the reasons why we see so few ships of the Soviet fleet ranging the
waters of the world,'' Sharpe said.
   He also said the Soviet Union keeps its navy bottled up because
Moscow sees its fleet as fulfilling an essentially defensive role.
   Indeed, this hypothesis is now so widely accepted that the
latest U.S. naval policy envisages entering Soviet home waters
during a war, said Sharpe.
   But despite such a ``visibly wimpish Soviet policy at sea,'' the
Soviet fleet is capable of a ``swift breakout into the vulnerable
sea lanes of the Western world,'' he said.
   Pointing to the recent buildup of U.S. naval forces, Sharpe
called the U.S. Navy ``rejuvenated and formidable.''
   But he said such improvements have made coordination with
America's weaker allies more difficult.
   ``The United States is more and more operating on its own and is
going to find it harder and harder to ally with the NATO forces on
this side of the Atlantic,'' Sharpe told a news conference on
Tuesday.
   In times of trouble, Sharpe said, the U.S. Navy would probably
not wait to consult with NATO and ``subordinate itself to a
polyglot talking shop of the Brussels variety.'' Brussels is the
headquarters of the 16-nation North American Treaty Organization.
   Sharpe noted U.S. Navy commanders publicly deny a go-it-alone
policy. But he maintained this policy is what has developed because
of U.S. naval superiority and slow decision-making by NATO.
   Every navy now operates ``in the shadow'' of the huge fleets of
the superpowers, he said.
   But despite Soviet naval advances, including development of
quieter submarines, Sharpe said the U.S. Navy still has the edge
because of its better-trained personnel.

<HEAD>Protein Defect Found in Muscular Dystrophy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The protein deficiency that triggers a rare form
of muscular dystrophy has been pinpointed, according to a study
that an expert called a ``key victory'' in finding the causes of
the crippling disease of children.
   The research was conducted by Dr. Louis M. Kunkel and colleagues
at Children's Hospital in Boston and reported in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   They found that the disorder is caused by problems with the
muscle protein called dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy results
if the body produces too little of the protein or makes an abnormal
form of it.
   ``We've scored another key victory in uncovering the causes of
muscular dystrophy, learning what must be set right to cure these
devastating diseases,'' said Dr. S. Mouchly Small, president of the
Muscular Dystrophy Association in New York.
   In December, Kunkel and his colleagues reported that a more
common form of the disease, called Duchenne's musclar dystrophy,
occurs when the protein is absent. Two years ago, Kunkel's team
reported the discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne's and
Becker muscular dystrophy.
   Duchenne's muscular dystrophy occurs in one in 3,300 births,
while Becker muscular dystrophy strikes one in 30,000 births.
   Both forms strike males almost exclusively and result in
progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles.
   The protein abnormalities in both forms result from an inborn
genetic defect. Genes contain the code that instruct the body to
make all the proteins necessary for life.

   Students threw firebombs and rocks at
an American bank today, farmers opposing U.S. imports battled riot
police, and Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jai ordered a crackdown on
anti-American protests.
   Police said four people were arrested when 30 students dashed
out of sidestreets and hurled rocks and about 10 firebombs at a
branch in southern Seoul of the Koram Bank.
   The bank, a joint venture between the Bank of America and Korean
business groups, had not yet opened for business and had shutters
over its windows and entrance. It was not damaged.
   Shouting ``Go home Yankees'' and other slogans, the students
scattered leaflets calling for ``independent, democratic''
reunification with North Korea. It was the first attack on an
American business in a wave of violent anti-U.S. protests in Seoul
and other cities during the past week.
   Radical students blame the United States for the partition of
the Korean peninsula and accuse Washington of supporting military
rule in the south. They demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Last week protesters hurled rocks and firebombs at American
cultural centers in Seoul and the southern city of Kwangju and
threw homemade bombs at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. Up to a dozen
police and students were hurt in the attacks, but no U.S. personnel
was injured.
   U.S. and Soviet troops split the Korean peninsula when the
Japanese occupation ended in 1945 at the end of World War II. The
two Koreas _ the pro-Western south and the communist north _ are
bitter opponents.
   Riot police fired tear gas to disperse 500 farmers trying to
march into the National Assembly building in Seoul today. The
farmers were protesting plans to increase imports of U.S.
agricultural products.
   In some rural areas police scuffled with groups of farmers
staging similar protests. At least five people, including an
opposition lawmaker, were injured. The farmers, accompanied by two
calves, hurled cow dung, burned an effigy of the United States and
used clubs to fight police. Police in green combat fatigues and
black helmets kicked and punched farmers.
   The protest in Seoul lasted two hours, with farmers shouting
``Oppose American beef and its pressure to open the Korean market''
and other anti-U.S. slogans. At one point, a calf ran amok through
the 1,000 riot police surrounding the assembly compound before
being grabbed by police.
   The United States is pushing South Korea to widen its domestic
markets to American imports to redress Seoul's $10 billion trade
surplus with Washington.
   The trade issue has fanned anti-U.S. sentiment and dissidents
charge the United States disregards the wishes of the Korean people
with ``coercive'' demands.
   Prime Minister Lee, in a Cabinet meeting today, called for tight
security to guard foreign legations and public facilites from
violence by radicals.
   Lee said the recent wave of violent protests posed a threat to
the people and ``inflicted undesirable influence on the nation's
security and diplomacy before staging the Olympics.'' The Olympic
Games open in Seoul in September.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative talk-show host Morton Downey Jr.'s
recently taped program on AIDS included one surprise guest: the
host's own brother, who has AIDS.
   The outspoken Downey surprised the studio audience at the taping
of his TV show on Friday by introducing his 52-year-old homosexual
brother, Tony, the New York Post reported today.
   Downey, 55, said his younger brother would move to New Jersey
from California to stay with him and his family.
   ``He's my family and I'm going to take care of him,'' said
Downey, known for his anti-gay tirades on his soon-to-be nationally
syndicated program. ``I still object to what I call perverted love,
but nonetheless, he's my brother.''
   The program, to be broadcast June 15 locally on WWOR-TV, also
deals with the high cost of AIDS drugs like AZT. Tony Downey pays
$1,200 a week for the medication, the Post said.
   ``He (Tony) had told me a long time ago that if the time came
when there was no reversal, he would like to come on my show and
talk about his lifestyle to help people,'' Downey said. ``I had to
give him his moment.''
   ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show'' will begin national syndication
Monday.

<TEXT>
   A senior Soviet general today provided for the
first time a count of Soviet troop strength in Afghanistan, saying
100,300 soldiers were deployed there before the contingent began to
withdraw on May 15.
   The number provided by Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, chief of
the Soviet military general staff and a first deputy defense
minister, was nearly 15,000 less than claimed by Western
intelligence sources.
   Akhromeyev provided the figure the day after Gen. Alexei D.
Lizichev, another leading ministry official, provided a casualty
count for the first time _ 13,310 Soviet soldiers killed in
Afghanistan, 35,478 wounded and 311 missing.
   Lizichev had refused to provide a figure for the size of the
Soviet force.
   Akhromeyev, asked at a news conference on U.S.-Soviet relations
about the size of the Soviet force in Afghanistan, said: ``The
contingent in Afghanistan as of May 15 numbered 100,300.''
   He said 9,500 soldiers had left the country since the withdrawal
began.
   The size of the Soviet force in Afghanistan has been estimated
for years by Western intelligence sources at about 115,000
soldiers. But earlier this spring, Italian officials who met with
First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov quoted him as putting
troop strength there at 100,000.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced one
Communist government with another and remained to help fight
anti-Marxist guerrillas.
   Under an agreement signed in Geneva on April 14, all Soviet
troops are to be out of Afghanistan within nine months.

   Just a day after his photograph was unveiled on City Hall's
``Wall of Mayors,'' Orr was dumped Wednesday as vice mayor by the
City Council on a 31-15 vote.
   The action was apparently a retaliation for his demands for
better accounting among Council members.
   Orr, 43, a Democrat known as a strong proponent of ethics
legislation, was thrust into the spotlight as acting mayor when
Harold Washington died of a heart attack Nov. 25. Orr held the
mayor's job just seven days before the council, in a raucous,
all-night session, elected Eugene Sawyer to succeed Washington. Orr
had not sought the post.
   But in presiding over that council meeting, Orr angered some
Sawyer supporters who thought he delayed calling for a vote. His
support in the council continued to erode as council members
objected to his persistent call for more controls over the way they
spend their money.
   In Monday's Chicago Tribune, Orr repeated his view that council
members should be more accountable for their $18,000 continency
funds and for their travel and office expenses. Currently, they are
not required to disclose how that money is spent.
   ``Everything he has done ... has been done to demean us, to make
us out to be thieves, ignoramuses and low-lifes,'' fumed Alderwoman
Anna Langford. ``He has to tell us how to run the council.''
   Orr, however, said he will continue to push for accountability
despite his ouster.
   ``This is only going to invigorate me,'' he said. ``I'm
absolutely convinced that the majority of the people of Chicago
support me. ... In some ways, I'm honored to be dumped by some of
these folks.''
   Orr said he didn't know whether Sawyer, also a Democrat,
actively supported his ouster but added that he believes the
current administration is weak.
   Alderman Terry Gabinski was named to succeed Orr as vice mayor,
a post considered mainly ceremonial.
   Orr taught history and urban affairs at Mundelein College before
he defeated three challengers to win election to the City Council
in 1979. His support for ethics legislation matched the agenda of
Washington, who made him vice mayor in 1986 as Washington began
building his council base.
   Being mayor, Orr said, was ``kind of an accident of history, and
I'm really proud of what I did.''
   ``I fought for religious and racial tolerance and City Council
accountability,'' he said.
   Orr's ouster came a day after his photograph was unveiled on the
``Wall of Mayors'' outside Sawyer's fifth-floor office.
   ``He still was mayor,'' Sawyer told reporters when asked why
Orr's picture should join the honored group. ``It is extremely
well-deserved. ... What's fair is fair.''

   Showers and thunderstorms dampened the southern and central High
Plains and the southern Atlantic Seaboard today after storms dumped
heavy rain on sections of South Dakota.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell on the northern
Rockies, the northern High Plains, New England and the Florida
Keys. Fair skies prevailed over much of the nation's eastern half
and the Southwest.
   Frost and freeze advisories were posted for extreme western
Maryland, western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, western New York
state, lower Michigan and the eastern third of upper Michigan.
   Slow-moving thunderstorms Wednesday night dropped more than 4
inches of rain in three hours in Buffalo County, S.D., and hail the
size of golf balls, and generated 55 mph winds.
   Another thunderstorm produced hail an inch in diameter 10 miles
south of Midland in southwest Texas.
   Today's forecast called for rain in the northern Pacific Coast,
showers scattered across southeast New England, and rain showers
and thunderstorms over the southern two-thirds of Florida. Skies
were expected to be sunny over much of the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 50s and 60s from
New England and New York to North Carolina; 60s and 70s along the
Pacific Coast and across the Pacific Northwest; 70s from the upper
Great Lakes to the Tennessee Valley, and from Alabama to Georgia,
South Carolina and northern Florida; and the 90s to near 110
degrees over the desert Southwest. Highs were expected to reach the
80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 35
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 85 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   A promotional firm in Decatur, Ill.,
thought it had finished its research when it asked 11 other
Decaturs around the country to compete in a contest to raise food
for the needy.
   But it missed Decatur, N.Y.
   However, the 312 citizens of the central New York village say
they aren't insulted since they're used to being overlooked.
   ``I'm not surprised,'' said town supervisor Gary Hughes. ``We
don't show in the Rand McNally atlas.''
   A group called Decatur Advantage came up with the idea of
challenging the country's Decaturs to see which one could collect
the most cans of food for the poor based on percentage of
population.
   After poring through atlases, the Illinois group found Decaturs
in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi,
Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas. They also found Decatur counties in
Iowa and Kansas, said Jan Cook, a spokeswoman for Decatur Advantage.
   But they didn't spot Decatur, N.Y.
   ``It's nice to know there's another one out there,'' Cook said.
``We didn't mean to forget you.''
   The Nebraska Decatur, with 723 people, was thought to be the
smallest of the communities, but the central New York village's
population is less than half that. The largest, Decatur, Ill., has
more than 94,000 people.
   Hughes said he's not surprised his town was overlooked. After
all, he said, it doesn't even have a zip code, its ``downtown''
consists of 10 houses and the only way to find it is look at a
town-by-town map of the state.
   The official competition between Decaturs starts Friday and runs
through Aug. 3, Cook said. Hughes said he'd like to see more
information before committing the Otsego County village to the
contest.

<TEXT>
   Flooding in three provinces in southern China has
killed 117 people and injured nearly 500, an official report said
today. The disaster has rendered thousands homeless and isolated
hundreds of thousands.
   The death toll from flooding in Fujian province has reached 82,
with 436 people injured and five missing, the English-language
China Daily reported.
   A front-page photograph shows basketball hoops just above
water-level at the playground of the No. 2 High School in Jianyang
County, an especially hard-hit area.
   In neighboring Jiangxi province, three people died and 60 were
injured Friday and Saturday, while 32 died in Hunan province, to
the west of Jiangxi, in flooding from three days of rain that ended
Saturday, the paper said.
   The China Daily report was the first to mention flooding in
Hunan province and to give a death toll for the flooding in Jiangxi.
   More than 730,000 people in Fujian province have been trapped by
the floods, which also damaged 56,750 homes and wiped out 860
bridges and 1,550 irrigation works, said Yao Shaoyu, deputy chief
of the Ministry of Civic Affairs' relief bureau.
   Farmers have lost about 5,500 pounds of grain, 700 head of
livestock and more than 50,000 chicken and other fowl, the paper
said.
   In Jiangxi province, 1,000 homes were destroyed and 22 miles of
communication wires were damaged, while 1,913 homes, 1,276 dikes
and 572 bridges were destroyed in Hunan.
   China has been plagued by freakish weather this spring,
including hailstorms in coastal and central China that killed at
least 24 people and injured more than 250 and a tornado in
Guangdong province in southern China that killed five people.

<HEAD>AIDS Test Ordered for Convicted Sex Offender</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered a convicted sex offender to
submit to a test for the AIDS virus over the objections of the
man's attorney, who called it an invasion of privacy.
   Attorney Robert Gombiner said he would advise client Steven G.
Farmer not to comply with the order by King County Superior Court
Judge Charles Johnson, and said he would appeal.
   Johnson ruled Tuesday that Farmer, 34, should receive the test
before sentencing June 7.
   The former flight attendant was convicted last month of two
counts of patronizing a teen-age male prostitute and two counts of
sexual exploitation of a minor.
   Deputy prosecutor Rebecca Roe said that if the test is positive,
she would seek a 10-year sentence for Farmer. The normal maximum
sentence for the crime is three years and seven months.
   Ms. Roe contended Farmer knew he had tested positive for the
virus that can cause AIDS when he had contact with young male
prostitutes.
   She said that if Farmer resists the order, she will seek a
warrant to take the blood by force in the county jail.
   Johnson said the test results would be supplied only to the
court and to lawyers.
   ``It is a patently illegal order,'' said Gombiner. ``If your
honor wants to hold us in contempt, you can, but I am telling Mr.
Farmer he is not to comply with this order.''
   He said the ruling violated Farmer's right to privacy,
especially in light of a state law enacted this year that restricts
such examinations.
   ``There is no God-given right for the state to go around
sticking needles in people and taking out little vials of blood,''
Gombiner said.
   He said he would ask the state Court of Appeals to stay
Johnson's order and review the ruling.
   AIDS, which damages the body's immune system and leaves victims
susceptible to infections and cancer, is spread through sexual
contact. It is also spread through needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Soviet Artists Match West In Lively Paintings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exhibition of works by 34 Soviet artists that
is touring Europe shows Russian painters are doing work as lively,
innovative _ and often as strange _ as anything done in the West.
   The 35 paintings, which will be sold in July at the first
international art auction in Moscow since the 1917 Russian
revolution, are being shown in Europe to attract bidders.
   ``The tour and the sale introduce the excellence of modern
Soviet painting to Western collectors, as well as offering more
familiar works of the avant-garde period that followed the
revolution,'' said Simon de Pury, managing director of the 23
European offices of Sotheby's auction house.
   The works were shown in New York earlier this month and have
just been displayed at Sotheby's in London for three days. They
will be seen in Paris today and Friday, in Cologne May 31-June 3
and in Zurich June 9-15, before returning to Moscow.
   In one painting, by Ilya Glazunov, a glowing scene depicts an
old Russian city with monks and onion-shaped church domes
surmounted by modern buildings and a red-flag procession.
   Another, by Svetlana Kopystianskaya, is comprised of a blue
crumpled cloth in a box, mysteriously titled ``Dialogue: N.2.''
   Ilya Kabakov paints words on his canvases. One of his works
titled ``Where Are You?'' consists of 36 sheets of paper with words
on them, each page signed and dated and contained in a box.
   From 1928, when dictator Josef Stalin achieved supreme power,
there were two kinds of Soviet art: the official one that glorified
the state and the unofficial one which didn't and was practised
behind the scenes.
   ``Under the new policy ... the distinction between `official'
and `unofficial' art is no longer being made by the Ministry of
Culture,'' de Pury said.
   He helped select the works for auction after getting to know the
artists during Moscow visits to arrange loans of pictures when he
was curator of Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza's famous picture
collection in Lugano, Switzerland.
   The auction was negotiated with the Soviet culture ministry by
Lord Gowrie, Sotheby's chairman in Britain and a former arts
minister and art dealer. Most of the sale works are in the $3,700
to $9,300 price range. A few run up to $22,000 to $28,000.
   There is a strong emphasis on abstraction and fractured images
in the pictures, but there are also portraits and dreamy views of
the land and cities.
   The London showing drew a large number of viewers.
   ``Some of our visitors asked if we had been taken over by the
Russians,'' said a Sotheby's receptionist as a banner with the
firm's name in Cyrillic letters was taken down from the building.

   The dollar edged up against most major currencies
in European trading today ahead of the release of key U.S.
econonmic data. Gold prices fell.
   Traders said market sentiment for the dollar was generally
bullish, but said little movement was expected before the scheduled
1:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. EDT) release of revised figures on
first-quarter growth of the U.S. gross national product.
   One dealer at a West German bank said there was a growing
perception that the dollar had support at its current levels.
   Midmorning dollar rates, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7085 West German marks, up from 1.7045
   _1.4260 Swiss francs, up from 1.4245
   _5.7675 French francs, up from 5.7550
   _1.9133 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9090
   _1,268.65 Italian lire, up from 1,264.50
   _1.2380 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2434
   The dollar rose against the British pound, which was quoted at
$1.8615, compared with $1.8650 on Wednesday.
   The U.S. currency closed at 124.50 Japanese yen in Tokyo, up
from 124.30 yen. In London trading later today, the dollar was
quoted at 124.63 yen.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$453 a troy ounce, down from $454 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $452.70, down from $454.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell sharply, closing at a bid of
$452.42, against $460.27 Wednesday.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $6.56 a troy
ounce, down from $6.67.

   Israeli fighter-bombers and helicopter
gunships attacked Shiite Moslem guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon
today, hours after rocketing Palestinian positions near Sidon,
police said.
   Smoke billowed from the hills overlooking the southern villages
of Lowaizeh and Mleekh as jets and gunships struck in three
bombing, rocketing and strafing sorties starting at 8 a.m.
   The Israeli army confirmed the new raid in a brief communique
that said Israeli planes attacked targets southwest of Lowaizeh.
The pilots reported accurate hits and returned safely to base.
   Police in Sidon said they had no immediate report of casualties
from the two villages about 15 miles north of the Israeli border.
   On Wednesday, the two neighboring villages and the village of
Soujud were attacked by Israeli-allied militiamen in a ground
assault mounted behind an Israeli army artillery barrage.
   Israeli news reports today said 40 guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah were killed and about 30 wounded in those raids.
   Hezbollah said 25 of its fighters were killed, 17 wounded and 20
were missing. Hezbollah's rival, the pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem Amal
militia, said three of its guerrillas were killed and 10 wounded.
   An Israeli army spokesman said five militiamen from the South
Lebanon Army were wounded, one of them seriously.
   Israeli forces reported no casualties.
   Today's strike was Israel's 11th air raid on Lebanon this year.
Fifty-two people were killed and 81 wounded in the previous 10
strikes since Jan. 3.
   Four Israeli helicopter gunships struck at Palestinian
guerrillas on Sidon's outskirts late Wednesday, killing two
guerrillas and wounding four.
   Police said a cluster of cement shacks belonging to Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction took the brunt of the latest raid. Four shacks and three
vehicles were destroyed.
   The target was about 200 yards from Fatah's ``cubs school'' at
the teeming Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp, where dozens of young
guerrilla trainees were asleep. The ``school'' was not hit, police
said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that the day-long sweep
Wednesday was part of an Israeli policy ``aimed at preventing the
establishment and entrenchment of terrorist bases'' used to launch
attacks on Israel.
   Lowaizeh, Mleekh and Soujud were described as strongholds of
Hezbollah.
   Israeli radio reports said dozens of guerrillas fled north from
the area and that many villagers spent the night in nearby fields.
   According to the Israeli news reports, Wednesday's sweep
involved about 600 South Lebanon Army fighters using 45 tanks and
armored personnel carriers.
   Israeli troops assisted with heavy artillery fire and rocket
attacks from helicopter gunships, the reports said.
   Hezbollah and Amal, Arabic for hope, are locked in a 3-week-old
battle for control of Beirut's southern slums, where most of the 18
foreign hostages in Lebanon are believed held.
   Today, Hezbollah and Amal gunners dueled sporadically with
mortars, howitzers and tank cannons on the 21st day of fighting for
the slums, a 16-square-mile warren of narrow alleyways and
cement-block shanties.
   Police said they had no new casualty report. Their toll for the
previous 20 days of fighting stood at 296 killed and 1,000 wounded.
   Hezbollah fighters, who have wrested control of more than 90
percent of the slums from Amal, were bracing for a final assault,
police said.
   Syria has massed 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored
vehicles around the slums for 12 days and has been threatening to
occupy the shantytown.

<HEAD>Britain Announces New Measures To Ban Religious Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New laws to combat discrimination of Roman
Catholics in Northern Ireland's job market will force companies to
report annually on how many Catholics and Protestants they employ.
   But the measures the government proposed on Wednesday stop short
of imposing hiring quotas from among the 40 percent Catholic
minority. Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King said that would be
``inflammatory.''
   The laws, expected to be enacted by Parliament and take effect
in mid-1989, mark the toughest attempt to end job discrimination in
British-run Northern Ireland, where Catholic unemployment runs at
2{ times the Protestant rate.
   The measures were spurred partly by threats of disinvestment
from the United States, an anti-discrimination tactic the British
government calls misguided.
   Seven American states have endorsed fair employment principles
put forward in 1984 by the late Irish statesman Sean MacBride that
call for disinvestment measures against companies in Northern
Ireland accused of religious bias.
   Several more states are expected to follow suit. American
investment accounts for nearly 14 percent of the jobs in Northern
Ireland.
   Under the new laws, companies with more than 25 employees _ and
later with 10 or more _ will have to submit annual reports on the
religious composition of the workforce to a new body, the Fair
Employment Commission. Failure to do so will be a criminal offense
punishable by a fine of up to $3,720.
   The laws would also ban ``indirect discrimination'' in hiring
practices, such as taking recruits from a single school _ Catholics
and Protestant children are educated separately _ or getting
current employees to find new workers.
   The commission, replacing a watchdog body set up in 1976, will
have powers to order companies to recruit from a wider area, such
as advertising in Catholic publications.
   Companies that ignore commission directives could be charged
with contempt of court and denied government contracts.
   Northern Ireland is among the most economically depressed
regions of the United Kingdom. The province's unemployment rate of
17.4 percent is double the national average.
   The Social Democratic Labor Party, the province's main moderate
Catholic party, criticized the moves as not being tough enough.
   Alasdair MacLaughlin, director of the Confederation of British
Industry in Northern Ireland, said the employers' organization was
concerned about the way in which targets and timetables are to be
used.
   ``It will be essential that both government and the Fair
Employment Commission on a continuing basis make it crystal clear
that the object of the legislation is not to create or impose
quotas,'' he said.
   In London, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on Northern
Ireland, Kevin McNamara, said the lack of any targets to judge the
success of the proposed legislation was a government ``cop-out.''

<HEAD>Two Student Given Jail Time For Drinking Party At Princeton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jail terms given two Princeton
University students for their role in initiation parties that
prompted 46 students to seek medical attention for overdrinking
were ``excessive,'' the school's president says.
   Kenneth Simpler, 20, of Rehoboth Beach, Del., and Lisa
Napolitano, 21, of Geneva, N.Y., were each sentenced to 30 days in
jail and a $500 fine Wednesday.
   Simpler, a junior who is president of the Charter Club, and Ms.
Napolitano, a junior who is the university eating club's former
social chairman, were convicted May 18 of serving alcoholic
beverages to minors in February.
   Municipal Court Judge Russell Annich said Wednesday he did not
consider the incident a college prank that got out of hand.
   ``I'm not aware of a similar event that has produced as many
casualties,'' said Annich. ``It is a violation of the law.''
   He delayed the start of the sentences so attorneys could appeal.
   Princeton President Harold Shapiro said he was shocked to hear
the students will have to serve jail sentences.
   ``While the incidents in question are certainly serious in
nature, the penalty seems to me clearly disproportionate and
excessive,'' Shapiro said.
   The initiation parties Feb. 6 by the Charter Club and the
Cloister Inn _ two of 13 fraternity-like eating clubs on campus _
resulted in 39 students going to the university's McCosh Infirmary
and seven requiring treatment at the Medical Center at Princeton.
   Many of the students were underage. New Jersey's legal drinking
age is 21.
   Simpler and Ms. Napolitano were convicted after a one-day trial
in which witnesses testified that students seeking to join the club
were blindfolded and led from room to room as club members poured
drinks down their throats.
   James Martin, 20, the social chairman of the Cloister Inn,
previously agreed to plead guilty to a disorderly persons offense.
Charges against two other Cloister Inn officers were dismissed for
lack of evidence.
   Defense attorney Kim Otis called the jail penalty ``totally
inappropriate.''
   ``We argued that there was selective prosecution and this is
selective sentencing _ this is scapegoating,'' Otis said.
   But prosecutor Michael Barrett said ``if we had information that
pointed a finger at other people we would have pursued it.''
   The case was one of two major drinking incidents at New Jersey
universities.
   Aggravated hazing charges stemming from the drinking-related
death of an 18-year-old fraternity pledge have been filed against
15 Rutgers University students, including seven officers of the
now-closed Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

<HEAD>Neighbors Agree To Restore Non-Aggression Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa and Mozambique have
revived a non-aggression pact that lapsed three years ago, agreeing
not to support guerrilla movements operating in each other's
territory.
   The agreement reached Wednesday between ranking diplomats and
military officials of the two neighbors was the latest in a series
of recent developments signaling an easing of hostilities.
   The two sides said in a statement that they would reactivate
meetings of a joint security commission ``at the earliest possible
date.''
   The commission was established under the 1984 Nkomati Accord, a
non-aggression treaty in which each country pledged to halt support
for guerrillas fighting against the other government.
   Although technically still in effect, the treaty has been
ignored since 1985, when Mozambique found documents indicating
South Africa was violating the agreement through continued aid to
the Mozambican rebels.
   Since then, the main source of friction between the countries
has been Mozambique's persistent charge that South Africa has
continued covert assistance to the Mozambique National Resistance
rebel movement.
   South Africa denies the charge.
   The war has devastated Mozambique's economy and is the main
cause of a nationwide famine that has left nearly 6 million of the
country's 14.5 million people in need of food aid.
   Wednesday's statement said: ``The two delegations affirmed the
commitments of their respective governments not to support the
commission of violence against the peoples of their respective
countries.''
   No date was announced for the security commission to meet, but
both sides have appeared eager in recent weeks to improve relations.
   South Africa has offered logistical aid to help protect a
Mozambican hydroelectric project from rebel saboteurs and the
chairman of South Africa's largest conglomerate visited Maputo to
discuss possible investment.
   In addition, officials of both countries say a summit meeting
may be arranged between their presidents, South Africa's P.W. Botha
and Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano.
   Mozambique's delegation at Wednesday's talks was headed by the
army commander, Lt. Gen. Tobais Dai. South Africa's delegation was
led by the director-general of the Foreign Affairs Department, Niel
Van Heerden, and included the army chief, Lt. Gen. A.J. Liebenberg.

<HEAD>Suspicious Juice Package Addressed to Dann's Ex-husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An envelope leaking fruit juice was found
in a postal box addressed to the ex-husband of Laurie Dann, and
authorities were trying to determine if it was part of the woman's
shooting and poisoning spree.
   The package addressed to Russell Dann was found Wednesday at a
suburban post office, police said.
   It had no return address and was turned over to a laboratory to
determine if the juice had been tainted and Dann sent it, said
police Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis.
   Dann, 30, fired on students Friday at Hubbard Woods Elementary
School in this affluent Chicago suburb, killing an 8-year-old boy
and wounding five other children. She then wounded a young man at a
home nearby and killed herself.
   Before her death, Dann mailed or delivered up to 24 packages of
snacks or juice _ most tainted with arsenic _ to acquaintances,
including several families for whom she had worked as a babysitter,
Kalvaitis said.
   The FBI and police are investigating.
   Investigators said they would seek a court order today forcing
Dr. John H. Greist, a psychiatrist affiliated with the University
of Wisconsin-Madison, to release his records on Dann, whom he
treated when she was a student there in 1977.
   Greist also received a drink container in the mail this week
that is being tested for poison, the FBI said.
   Meanwhile, the principal of Hubbard Woods Elementary School,
Richard Streedain, said the psychological impact of the shootings
lingers in the school's classrooms and hallways.
   ``One child is now in extreme stress because she (Dann) stuck a
gun to his head and pulled the trigger, but it clicked,'' he said
in a interview in today's Peoria Journal Star.
   Three of the shooting victims were reported in good condition at
hospitals today, two were in fair condition and one was in serious
condition.

<TEXT>
   A transplant specialist examined Ferdinand
Marcos two days before the former Philippine president entered a
hospital complaining of chest pains, a TV station reported.
   Dr. Livingston Wong, chief of St. Francis Medical Center's
transplant team, and two unidentified doctors _ a cardiologist and
a kidney specialist from the Philippines _ saw Marcos on Sunday at
his home here, KHON said Wednesday.
   The station gave no sources for the report.
   Wong refused to comment on the report. Marcos spokesman Gemmo
Trinidad said he knew nothing about the reported visit.
   Marcos, 70, remained in guarded condition Wednesday night in the
intensive care unit at the medical center, Trinidad said. Earlier
in the day, Marcos' physician, Dr. Derek Pang, ruled out the
possibility of a heart attack, Trindidad said.
   More tests were ordered for today to determine if a lung ailment
caused the chest pains that led Marcos to enter the hospital
Tuesday night, he said.
   Marcos' staff stationed guards in the intensive care unit and at
every entrance to the hospital.
   Marcos wife, Imelda, said in a radio interview aired in Manila
that the former president is suffering because he has not been
allowed to return home.
   Tomas Gomez, Philippine consul general to Hawaii, dismissed the
pains as an attempt on the part of Marcos to return to his homeland
for the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May
4 at the age of 95.
   ``I think these are charades. These chest pains are not
substantiated medically,'' Gomez said. ``The problem I have with
Mr. Marcos is you never know when he's telling the truth.''
   President Corazon Aquino, saying Marcos continues to pose a
threat the national security of the Philippines, has refused to
lift the ban on his return, which she imposed in 1986 after he fled
into exile here.
   Marcos' quest to return home drew support from several
Philippine politicians.
   ``This is going to create another problem if (Marcos) comes home
in a box,'' said Sen. Ernesto Maceda. ``Now is the time for the
government to act to allow him to return.''

<TEXT>
   A federal jury convicted two record company
executives and a reputed mob figure of conspiring to extort $1.25
million from a record wholesaler.
   Morris Levy, 60-year-old president of Roulette Records in New
York, Roulette comptroller Howard Fisher, 60, and reputed Genovese
crime family member Dominick Canterino, 57, were convicted
Wednesday.
   Each could receive up to 40 years in prison at sentencing July 8
for conspiracy to commit extortion.
   Defense attorneys said they would appeal.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Brotman raised bail for Canterino
and Levy from $500,000 to $1 million after Assistant U.S. Attorney
Bruce Repetto said Levy might flee to Australia. Repetto had asked
for $5 million bail each.
   Prosecutors contended the three defendants sought to move in on
the wholesaling business of John LaMonte of Darby, Pa. Authorities
said the case is an example of how the mob is trying to infiltrate
the recording industry.
   Defense attorneys said the three merely wanted LaMonte to make
good on a 1985 deal to pay for $1.25 million worth of records and
tapes bought from MCA Records Inc. of Los Angeles. MCA was not
charged in the case.

   The 5-year-old son of actor Peter O'Toole
returned from London with his American mother pending a decision on
which parent should have custody.
   Karen Somerville of Middleton Township, N.J., and her son,
Lorcan, arrived at Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday.
   ``They're very happy to be with each other,'' said Raoul Felder,
Ms. Somerville's lawyer.
   The Irish-born O'Toole, 55, had taken the boy on a visit to
Britain and refused to return him in early May, lawyers for Ms.
Somerville said.
   The 37-year-old former model, who took the actor's name but was
never married to him, received a court order in London on Tuesday
requiring O'Toole to return the boy pending a court hearing in New
Jersey on June 14.
   The couple have been fighting over their son since they parted
in 1983, and a New Jersey court had given them joint custody.
   O'Toole is known for such films as ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and
``The Lion in Winter.''

   Vietnam will withdraw 50,000 troops
from Cambodia by the end of the year and will pull out all its
forces by 1990, the official Cambodian SPK news agency said today.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, reporting from Hanoi, also reported
the pullout announcement.
   SPK quoted a communique from the Ministry of National Defense as
saying the soldiers would be returning home from June to December.
   Remaining troops will be placed under the command of the
pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government, SPK said.
   A 50,000-troop pullout would be by far the largest of six
partial withdrawals Vietnam claims to have made since 1982.
   About 20,000 troops returned home in the most recent and largest
withdrawal last November. The United States says that was the only
genuine withdrawal, and it estimates that 120,000-125,000
Vietnamese troops remain in the country battling about 50,000
guerrillas.
   SPK, monitored in Bangkok, said that over the past nine years,
the Cambodian government ``has gradually undertaken the defense
work by itself, thus creating the conditions for six annual
withdrawals of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Kampuchea
(Cambodia).''
   ``This time, the command of the Vietnamese volunteer army in
Kampuchea will also be pulled out from Kampuchea and the remaining
Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea are to be placed under the command
of the People's Republic of Kampuchea until their complete
withdrawal in 1990.''
   The announcement followed word on the Vietnamese pullout by a
senior Vietnamese Foreign Ministry official Wednesday to a group of
foreign diplomats in Hanoi, a Western diplomat in Bangkok said
today.
   The diplomat, quoting a cable from his country's embassy in
Hanoi, said he had no other details. He gave the information on
condition of anonymity.
   The development came before Sunday's start of the Moscow summit,
at which President Reagan has said he will ask Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to encourage the Vietnamese to resolve the
Cambodian conflict.
   The Soviet-armed Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and
are fighting guerrillas backed militarily or diplomatically by
China, non-communist Southeast Asian countries and the United
States.
   Hanoi had warned it will take unspecified action if the
guerrillas take advantage of the pullout to try to return to power.
   The strategy of the Khmer Rouge, the largest of the guerrilla
groups, has been to gain control of villages and wait for the
Vietnamese to withdraw in 1990.
   The Western diplomat said the Vietnamese were moving into the
interior of the country, leaving the Phnom Penh forces to guard the
Thai border area, the traditional area of fighting.
   Earlier this week, Reagan said in response to written questions
from reporters from Southeast Asian countries that he would raise
the Cambodian issue in Moscow.
   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand quoted Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze as telling him last week in
Moscow that the Kremlin would talk to the Vietnamese about ending
their occupation of Cambodia.
   That could represent a significant change of position _ the
Soviets previously stated they have no direct role to play in the
conflict and that Vietnam is a sovereign country whose policies the
Kremlin cannot influence.
   In exchange for rights at Vietnam's numerous military bases, the
Soviet Union gives Vietnam several billion dollars a year in aid.

   A tentative agreement that would
immediately close two dumps has been reached in a legal battle over
the regulation and disposal of hazardous waste from the Savannah
River nuclear weapons plant.
   Under the agreement, the federal Energy Department must close
two major hazardous waste dumps at the government plant and begin
developing detailed plans for closing and monitoring three others.
   The department also agreed the South Carolina Department of
Health and Environmental Control should have an active role in
regulating hazardous waste facilities at the Savannah River Plant,
a concession the state had sought for years.
   The agreement, submitted for approval this week to U.S. District
Judge Charles E. Simons Jr., was signed by the federal and state
agency and a coalition of environmental groups that had sued in
1985 over the handling of hazardous waste at the plant.
   James Chandler, a lawyer for the environmental groups, said the
agreement will lead to a cleaner environment at the facility and
make the Savannah River Plant more accountable to state and federal
laws.
   The Savannah River Plant produces plutonium and tritium for
nuclear weapons.

   Striking scriptwriters again failed to come
to terms with producers on residual payments from reruns but agreed
to another bargaining session this weekend in the 12-week-old
walkout.
   Negotiators for the Writers Guild of America also rejected a
proposal by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
to extend the proposed contract from three years to four, said WGA
Executive Director Brian Walton.
   However, Wednesday's five-hour bargaining session, conducted by
a federal mediator, ended with agreement to meet again Saturday.
   The 9,000 TV and film writers went on strike March 7 over
creative control and residuals.
   The walkout cut the TV season short for many shows and is
expected to delay the start of the fall season. It has also delayed
countless movie projects.
   The guild also announced it would take a membership vote tonight
to approve several independent contracts with TV production
companies.
   As of Wednesday afternoon, Walton said, 39 companies had signed
contracts with the union.
   Among the companies, he said, were those producing ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show,'' ``The Tonight Show,'' starring Johnny Carson,
Alien Productions, which makes ``Alf,'' Kenny Rogers Productions,
Henson & Associations, which makes the ``Muppets,'' and the
production company for ``Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.''
   ``Late Night With David Letterman'' agreed to an as-yet-unsigned
contract this week, union President George Kirgo said.
   Producers spokesman Herb Steinberg said the contracts represent
less than 10 percent of all film production and less than 15
percent of TV production.
   ``We'd rather put 4,000 writers back to work than 400,'' he said.
   During Wednesday's negotiations, producers proposed a formula
for one-hour prime-time shows sold into syndication, based on the
premise that such shows are selling poorly.
   ``They rejected the numbers but not the concept,'' Steinberg
said.
   Under the formula, which the producers have offered twice and
the writers have rejected twice, the producers proposed to drop a
fixed residual schedule and pay writers based on a show's success
in syndication.
   Producers said writers could earn as much as 150 percent more
than under their present pay schedule.
   The producers alliance said in a statement that the offer would
``meet the fixed residual requirement of the WGA, while satisfying
AMPTP objectives of having a market price sensitive formula.'' The
release didn't detail the offer.

   An Arab assailant sneaked up behind a Jewish
seminary student in a perfume market today and stabbed him in the
back, police said.
   The victim was hospitalized and identified as the son of an
Israeli government lawyer who handled land confiscation cases in
the occupied territories. But authorities said they believed the
attack was random.
   Police said another Jewish man was stabbed to death later today
in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Katamon, which borders
an Arab village. Israel radio quoted police as saying they believed
it was a criminal act not motivated by ethnic politics. The
neighborhood is a poor area with a high crime rate.
   The army lifted curfews imposed in parts of the occupied
territories after Palestinians defied the restrictions and called a
general strike to commemorate slain PLO leader Khalil Wazir.
   Curfews remained in effect in a village and a refugee camp in
the occupied West Bank.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, meanwhile, said the 24-week-old
Arab uprising has made peace more elusive, but reiterated that
Israel must vigorously pursue negotiations with its Arab neighbors.
   Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, 195 Palestinians have
been killed and hundreds wounded. Two Israelis have died.
   Witnesses identified the first stabbing victim as Chanoch
Albeck. Justice Ministry officials said he was the son of Plea
Albeck, who has handled land confiscation cases in the occupied
territories for the government.
   Jerusalem police spokesmen said the 16-year-old victim was
attacked from behind by a single Arab assailant as he walked
through the perfume market, a narrow lane in the Moslem Quarter,
apparently on his way to a seminary in the adjacent Jewish Quarter
of the city.
   Several Arabs were immediately detained for questioning and
police launched wide searches in the area, said spokesman Alex
Lapidot.
   A police source said it appeared unlikely that Albeck was
targeted and that investigators believed the attack was random.
   In a statement, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said he was
``shocked and disgusted. The Arab public in Jerusalem must
understand that such actions in the end will only hurt the Arabs.''
   Albeck, who wore a black yarmulka, was rushed by ambulance to
nearby Hadassah hospital with the knife sticking out of his back
after two other seminary students helped him to the Jewish quarter,
police and witnesses said.
   ``He had a knife in the upper part of his back. The entire knife
was inside,'' merchant Alex Yosipo told Israel radio. ``He said he
was alone when it happened, that he was stabbed and didn't know by
whom. There was apparently no scuffle. He was simply stabbed.''
   The radio said a witness to the attack, identified as Rami
Shebach, said he tried in vain to chase down the Arab assailant.
   A hospital official, reached by telephone, said the youth was
being treated in the intensive care unit and declined to give
further details.
   The last attack on an Israeli in the old city was last October,
when a 24-year old man was fatally shot in the head.
   On Wednesday, a PLO-mandated general strike shut down
transportation and commerce in the West Bank, Gaza and Arab east
Jerusalem. An army curfew confined 200,000 Arabs to their homes in
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
   The strike was called to mark the end of mourning for Wazir, the
PLO military commander, assassinated April 16 at his home outside
Tunis, Tunisia.
   Wazir, whose code name was Abu Jihad, spent his boyhood in Gaza
City. Israeli sources said Israel security forces were responsible
for his death. The Israeli government has not commented on the case.
   By early today, all curfews were lifted in Gaza, but two
remained in effect in the West Bank's Dheishe refugee camp and the
village of Shuweika, army officials said.
   On Wednesday, despite the curfews, scattered anti-Israeli
protests occurred, leaving at least six Arabs hurt.
   Peres' remarks were aimed at his political rival, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, who has said Israel should not enter peace talks
until calm has returned to the occupied territories.
   ``I think it's more difficult today,'' Peres, leader of the
leftist Labor Party, told Israel Television Wednesday night. ``The
road to peace is full of obstacles, full of disappointments. But
what is the alternative? To let the situation deteriorate?''
   Peres, responding to a question, told Israel Television he was
concerned about possible human rights violations in the occupied
territories, but did not elaborate.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer celebrated his
90th birthday at a gala Kennedy Center concert which ended with
Hammer conducting the National Symphony Orchestra in John Phillip
Sousa's ``Stars and Stripes Forever.''
   Music Director Mstislav Rostropovich handed over his baton
Wednesday night moments after Hammer announced he was giving
$250,000 to the orchestra. More than 3,000 well-wishers filled the
center's Concert Hall to celebrate the birthday of the
philanthropist, art collector and chairman of Occidental Petroleum
Corp.
   During the concert, Hammer sat in the President's Box with his
wife, Frances, and Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin.
   The audience included high-ranking government officials, members
of Congress, diplomats and leaders of the business and arts
communities, as well as Lady Bird Johnson, widow of former
President Lyndon Baines Johnson.
   Mounting the stage after the concert, Hammer said his dream of
creating ``a meaningful peace in the world is closer to reality
than ever before.'' He predicted that the Moscow summit talks
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will be a ``tremendous success.''
   ``I believe the die has been cast for realistic negotiations
that will lead to a new period of understanding and respect between
the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Hammer said.
   Hammer has been close to a long succession of Soviet leaders and
has struck trade deals with the Soviets for many years. He also is
chairman of the president's Cancer Board and has spent millions of
dollars on medical research aimed at finding a cancer cure.
   He proposed that a ``March of Dollars'' similar to the March of
Dimes against polio begun 50 years ago be held to accelerate cancer
research. He said he is lobbying congressional leaders to back
matching government funds for $500 million in private money to be
given to the National Cancer Institute over four years.
   Hammer shared the stage with members of the National Symphony
and Wednesday night's guest artists: violinists Yehudi Menuhin and
Isaac Stern, soprano Kiri Te Kanawa and Chinese pianist Yuhui Hong,
who made her U.S. debut at the concert.

<TEXT>
   An ordinance restricting smoking in public places
in the nation's third-largest city was overwhelmingly approved by
City Council.
   ``Chicago has to line up with the rest of the major cities. We
have been lagging,'' said Alderman Raymond Figueroa, whose proposal
was approved 33-8 with little debate Wednesday.
   New York and Los Angeles, the first- and second-largest cities,
already have smoking restrictions.
   The ordinance, which takes effect in 60 days, requires
restaurants with 40 or more seats to set aside smoking and
non-smoking areas, although they can be in the same room.
   In addition, Figueroa said, the ordinance requires employers to
designate smoking and no-smoking areas if workers request them.
   The ordinance forbids smoking in enclosed public places like
taxicabs, public restrooms, polling places and public meeting
halls. Bars, hotels and private meeting rooms are exempt.
   Figueroa said the ordinance carries fines ranging from $25 to
$100, with enforcement details still to be worked out.
   The quick passage of the ban surprised even some supporters.
Mayor Eugene Sawyer was prepared to break a tie vote in favor of
the measure, said aide Monroe Anderson.
   About 150 cities have enacted some kind of legislation
restricting smoking, health officials have said.

   The offspring of the Baby Boomers are
continuing their sharp increase of recent years, the Census Bureau
reported today.
   The number of Americans aged 5 and under totaled 18.3 million as
of 1987, up from 18.2 million in 1986 and just over 18 million the
year before that.
   Still, the total is well short of the 20.5 million preschoolers
recorded in 1961, near the end of the post World War II Baby Boom.
   Population experts stress that the current surge in tots does
not constitute another boom, but rather is an ``echo'' of that
earlier one, since the great mass of people born in the two decades
following that war are now producing their own families.
   This increase has been underway for several years, with the
number of Americans under age 5 up by 1.9 million from 1980 to 1987.
   Meanwhile, the number aged 5 to 17 has declined in this decade,
slipping from 47.4 million in 1980 to 45.3 million in the 1987
estimates.
   In the same period, those aged 18 to 24 declined from 30.0
million to 27.1 million, while all other age groups increased.
   Other findings of the study included:
   _Alaska and Louisiana both registered population losses for the
first time in this decade, as the continuing slowdown in the energy
industry affected growth rates in several states. Declines
continued in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Wyoming.
   _Population loss also affected agricultural states, with
declines reported for Iowa, North Dakota and Nebraska.

   Fire broke out in the first-floor library
of an eight-story apartment complex for the elderly, injuring 36,
officials said.
   Five of the injured were in critical condition, hospital
officials said.
   The three-alarm fire, which broke out 11 p.m. Wednesday at the
Davenport-Dunbar twin-tower apartment, was under control by 11:45
p.m. About 100 firefighters battled the blaze.
   Most of the injured suffered from smoke inhalation and
superficial officials said today.
   One of the buildings remained closed early today, while some
residents were allowed to return to the other tower, fire officials
said.
   Police Officer Raymond Copeland said the fire started in a
library separating the two towers. He said the cause was not
immediately known.
   The complex houses about 350 residents. About 220 evacuees spent
the night in a community center, Copeland said.

   A leopard fatally mauled a toddler whose
father used the animal in his rock 'n' roll nightclub act and had
fought a bill to restrict ownership of dangerous exotic animals,
authorities said.
   Five leopards owned by Joe Savage escaped from their cages
Wednesday at the singer's home on 200 acres near Ashland City, said
police Lt. Jim Blackmore.
   An orange spotted leopard attacked 2-year-old Nikka Savage in
the family's yard, where the child was playing, police said.
   Savage's only child died later Wednesday at Vanderbilt Medical
Center from blood loss and massive injuries to her head and neck,
said hospital spokeswoman Nancy Humphrey.
   The 7-year-old leopard, Tabus, was captured soon after the
attack, along with four others. More than 40 police officers and
wildlife officials using a helicopter searched for five hours
before finding the fifth leopard, a 40-pound cub.
   Tabu was tranquilized but died while being taken to a wildlife
facility, police said.
   Police Chief Joe Casey said he did not know how the animals got
out of the cages. Savage was in Las Vegas, Nev., when the attack
occurred, police said.
   All five animals had been declawed, said Dr. John Parker, a
veterinarian who had treated the animals.
   In 1986, Savage successfully lobbied against a bill in the
Legislature to restrict ownership of exotic animals.
   ``If an animal is kept in a very rural situation and he has
enough room and there are no other people around, what harm can it
do?'' Savage said in November.
   Savage, whose act features wild make-up and fireworks, has
traveled across the country performing with pythons and leopards in
his show.
   He was treated at a Nashville hospital in 1984 after a boa
constrictor choked him during an act, in which he wrapped snakes
around his neck.

   The major television networks have moved to
Moscow for a superpower summit that may end up producing more pomp
than news.
   President Reagan arrived early Thursday in Finland for a
four-day stopover en route to the Soviet Union. He arrives in
Moscow on Sunday for his fourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Reagan and Gorbachev had hoped to use the summit to sign a
treaty reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons, but
negotiations over the pact have stalled over the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative _ Star Wars _ and verification issues.
   ``It's clear both sides are prepared to accentuate the positive,
orchestrate the ceremonial side of the summit,'' said CBS anchor
Dan Rather. ``I think there'll be a lot of smiles, a lot of toasts
and a lot of talk about promise in the future and great beginnings.
   ``But one of the jobs of a reporter is to separate bullshine
from brass tacks. Unless something changes, it's going to be more
of the former and less of the latter.
   ``But the ceremonial stuff, it'll be terrific,'' he said. ``The
Russians are pretty good at great ceremony.''
   This will be the first visit by the 77-year-old Reagan to the
country he once called an evil empire, and it's the first visit of
an American president to the Soviet Union in 14 years.
   CBS started its pre-summit coverage Wednesday night with Rather
anchoring the ``CBS Evening News'' from Moscow. Features will
include a series of ``On the Road'' segments by correspondent
Charles Kuralt on the Transiberian Express. While Rather is in
Moscow, Bob Schieffer will hold down the fort in New York. ``He's
hoping news breaks out somewhere else,'' joked Rather.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' with Peter Jennings also began
broadcasting from Moscow on Wednesday.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw will originate from Moscow
beginning Monday. All the nightly newscasts will come from Moscow
through Wednesday, then move for the last two nights of the week to
London to assess European response to the superpower summit.
   PBS' Robert MacNeil, co-anchor of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' will report from Moscow each night of the summit through
June 2. Jim Lehrer will anchor in Washington.
   CNN's senior Washington anchor Bernard Shaw will anchor coverage
from Moscow with frequent live updates and coverage of arrivals,
departures, major remarks, speeches and photo opportunities.
   For cable viewers who want to see the Soviet angle on the story,
The Discovery Channel plans to air the hour-long Soviet news show
``Vremya'' each night of the summit at 9 p.m. EDT.
   ABC, NBC and CNN plan to have live coverage of Reagan's arrival
in Moscow on Sunday beginning at 6 a.m. EDT. ``CBS Sunday Morning''
will have a report on the arrival at 9 a.m. EDT.
   NBC's ``Sunday Today'' with Garrick Utley and Maria Shriver will
also originate from Moscow on Sunday. NBC will have a special
one-hour ``Meet the Press'' Sunday with Chris Wallace, Tom Brokaw
and John Chancellor. ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' will
feature an interview with National Security advisor Colin Powell in
a 90-minute special.
   All the weekday morning shows will have one co-anchor in Moscow
_ Bryant Gumbel for NBC's ``Today,'' Charles Gibson for ``Good
Morning America'' on ABC and Kathleen Sullivan for ``CBS This
Morning.''
   NBC additionally plans five-minute updates daily at noon during
the summit, and ABC says it plans occasional cut-ins during the day
for live coverage of significant remarks or news conferences.
   ABC's ``Nightline'' plans to link up with a Soviet news show one
night of the summit.

<HEAD>Syrian Official: Agreement Reached To End South Beirut Fighting</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Israel-Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Syrian official said Syria and a
pro-Iranian militia reached an agreement to stop fighting today in
the southern suburbs of Beirut.
   But gunners from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the Syrian-aided Amal continued fighting sporadically with mortars,
howitzers and tank cannons on the 21st day of struggle for the
slums, where 18 foreign hostages are believed held.
   Another report, in the leftist Beirut daily As-Safir, said a
solution to the conflict ``has been delayed because secret
negotiations on the fate of the American hostages in particular
have not reached a definite result.''
   Nine of the foreign hostages are Americans.
   The Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity in
Damuscus, said, ``Ending the fighting will create new hope for the
hostages, and Syria will spare no effort to secure their release,
regardless of their nationality.''
   The official did not give details of the agreement but said it
had been agreed to by all parties, including Iran and Amal, after a
meeting between President Hafez Assad of Syria and Hezbollah
leaders late Wednesday.
   Hezbollah is a group of Moslem Shiite fundamentalists in Lebanon
believed to be an umbrella for smaller organizations holding the
foreign hostages.
   Syria has been threatening to intervene to stop the fighting. It
has about 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored units ringing the
16-square-mile warren of narrow alleyways and cement shanties,
where nearly 300 persons have been killed in the fighting.
   Syrian officials also have been negotiating with Hezbollah and
Iranian officials, including two deputy foreign ministers, to work
out a plan for Syrian troop deployment to bring security to the
southern suburbs.
   Syrian sources have said that they were willing to use force if
necessary but it was only a last option.
   Threats to kill hostages if the Syrians used force have been
reported. The Syrians have said any action against the hostages
would be considered an act against Syria.
   The battle between Amal and Hezbollah over control of the
southern suburbs has created tension between Iran and Syria, which
is Iran's only major Arab ally in its 7{-year-old war with Iraq.
   Israeli planes today attacked Amal and Hezbollah positions in
south Lebanon today. It followed ground attacks by Israeli-allied
militiamen on two villages Wednesday.
   The As-Safir report, which could not be verified, quoted
unidentified diplomatic sources as saying ``serious negotiations''
are being held between Washington and Tehran and some
``Iranian-allied groups'' on the nine American hostages.
   The short report did not disclose further details.
   The hostage held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.

   A man accused of tricking 50 women into
giving him their underwear has been fined $500 and ordered to
undergo psychiatric treatment.
   ``I wasn't like this before,'' David Sanders, 38, told Circuit
Judge Joe B. McDade at sentencing Tuesday.
   Sanders had pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor theft.
The judge ordered a year's probation as well as the fine and
counseling.
   Sanders telephoned the women and said he was going to use the
underwear to play a practical joke on their boyfriends or husbands
by dressing an inflatable doll in the lingerie, said Verne Dentino,
assistant Peoria County state's attorney.
   Dentino said the victims were amazed how much information
Sanders had collected about their private lives to convince the
women he was friends with their husbands and boyfriends.
   The women agreed to leave their lingerie in brown bags outside
an apartment building where Sanders picked them up.
   Police arrested Sanders in March with incriminating notes in his
pockets, and a search of his home revealed a big collection of
women's lingerie.
   ``I'm very sorry for what I did,'' Sanders told McDade. ``I had
no intention of it getting out of hand. ... It's something that
just happened to me recently.''

<TEXT>
   Leading Soviet officials today called for burying
the ``corpse of the Cold War'' and lauded President Reagan for his
pledge to come to next week's summit in search of peace.
   They said the meetings could produce important advances in
negotiations toward a treaty to cut U.S. and Soviet long-range
nuclear arsenals by 50 percent.
   One official asserted U.S.-Soviet relations had warmed because
Reagan had adopted the Kremlin's way of thinking on disarmament and
international relations.
   Some of the nation's top advisers on foreign policy met with
reporters to discuss the summit and its significance for relations
between the superpowers. They generally forecast improving
relations.
   The state-run press also said superpower ties were improving.
The labor newspaper Trud pressed for a successful summit and said
that the vast majority of Americans want a better relationship with
Soviets. The newspaper Socialist Industry declared that the two
nations have entered a ``political thaw.''
   Reagan was to arrive Sunday for five days of meetings with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the fourth summit between the
two leaders in less than three years.
   ``Previously, our goals were more limited,'' said U.S. affairs
expert Georgy A. Arbatov, observing that Reagan and Gorbachev in
the past focused on easing tensions built up since World War II.
   ``Now, we have the possibility to move toward demilitarization
of Soviet-American relations,'' said Arbatov, head of the
USA-Canada Institute in Moscow.
   He compared the Cold War to a dying patient kept alive by
artificial means. The task at hand for Reagan and Gorbachev is to
bury ``this corpse of the Cold War, which with the help of
artificial means _ political adrenalin and the political machinery
of an artificial heart _ has been maintained in a semi-living
state.''
   Asked about Reagan's comment Wednesday that he viewed his
journey to the Soviet capital as a mission of peace, Arbatov smiled
and replied: ``I think there is something symbolic in this, that
Reagan is now coming with an olive branch to Moscow.''
   He said he was happy to concede that his view of Reagan had
changed from that of a cold warrior to a statesman with whom the
Kremlin can work. But Arbatov said the president himself brought
about the improvement by coming around to the Soviets' way of
thinking on disarmament and international relations.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, military chief of staff and first
deputy defense minister, restated Kremlin positions that there is
no Soviet superiority in conventional weapons in Europe or
excessive military spending. But asked for details, Akhromeyev made
the rare acknowledgement that the reported defense budget does not
reflect spending on research, development and production of weapons.
   Akhromeyev declined to say how much of the Soviet Union's gross
national product is invested in defense, saying he was privy only
to the budget approved by the Supreme Soviet, the nominal
parliament, which amounts to about 5 percent of government spending.
   Western estimates have put Soviet defense spending as high as 19
percent of the gross national product, which represents the total
value of all goods and services producted.
   Arbatov dismissed foreign assessments as ``speculation,'' but
conceded that Soviet military spending is proportionately higher
than in the United States because the Soviet gross national product
is lower while the demands of security are equal.
   Poking fun at the United States, Arbatov said the Soviet
military ``cannot do as the United States does and sell toilet
seats for $700 or a hammer for $150.'' He was apparently referring
to reports of excessive costs charged the U.S. government under
some private contracts with the Defense Department.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky told reporters
that the Soviets view the upcoming summit as an important step in
continuing improvement of relations rather than as a farewell to
Reagan, whose term ends in January.

   A policeman called to an office building
where a lawyer had disappeared found blood splattered on the floor
and walls and scuff marks outside the woman's office but concluded
she had probably cut her finger.
   The woman was later found bound and gagged at the home of a
building security guard and had been raped during her 13-hour
ordeal, police said.
   Police Chief Tony Bouza said the policeman, a 15-year veteran,
won't be disciplined for his handling of the Sunday night
kidnapping.
   ``There was no dereliction of duty, absence from post or failure
to respond,'' Bouza said Wednesday. ``I don't discipline people who
are trying to do their jobs and make a mistake in good faith.''
   He also dismissed the suggestion that prompter police action
could have prevented the rape or at least shortened the victim's
ordeal.
   ``We could not have prevented the rape, of that I'm sure,'' he
said. ``By the time the police were able to do anything the rape
had occurred. She had been missing for hours (by the time police
were called).''
   The abduction took place about 9 p.m. Sunday in a downtown
building where the woman had returned to her office to catch up on
some work, police said. Her husband reported her missing after he
went to pick her up at 11 p.m.
   Among the clues brought to officers' attention were blood on the
floor and walls outside her office, scuff marks, and the
observation of the victim's husband that she had apparently stopped
writing in mid-sentence.
   The officer, the senior patrolman at the scene, indicated in his
report that the woman had probably cut her finger in the office.
   The officer notified a homicide detective working the
after-midnight shift, but neither he nor the detective investigated
further, police said.
   The incident was treated as a missing person case, meaning that
it would not be assigned to a detective until the start of the next
business day, police said.
   Two homicide detectives sent to the scene Monday morning quickly
concluded there was evidence of a crime.
   In the meantime, employees of American Security had tracked down
the guard and staked out his house, where he had allegedly taken
the woman after putting her in the trunk of his car.
   Company investigators had been alerted when the guard, who
worked Sunday night, returned to the building about 3 a.m.,
ostensibly to use a cash machine, and was seen by another guard
with blood on his shirt, authorities said.
   Dwayne Alexander West, 24, was arrested Monday and charged with
two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.

production of drugs abroad,'' he said.
   Bush, in a campaign speech to a Chamber of Commerce audience,
also said he opposes any effort to weaken the Justice Department's
``zero tolerance'' policy for seizing vehicles on which drugs are
found.
   ``Some call this policy controversial, especially among those
big yacht owners out there,'' the vice president said. ``I think it
makes great sense. If people can lose their cars for parking
violations, surely they should lose them for carrying drugs. Zero
tolerance should be the policy of every state in the union.''
   The Republican presidential nominee-to-be planned to stress drug
themes all day in campaign appearances, including a visit in Newark
to a drug rehabilitation center.
   Bush said that, if elected, he would urge other nations to join
in establishing ``an international strike force to hit back, quick
and hard and often, at foreign drug operations.''
   He said it would be far simpler and less expensive to eradicate
drugs at their source than to try to find and get rid of them
later. ``We need to wipe out crops wherever they are grown and take
out labs wherever they exist,'' Bush said.
   The vice president also said he would make adoption of drug-free
programs a condition for companies to receive federal contracts
``and I will ask the states to do the same.''
   In Jersey City on Wednesday night, Bush said that even though he
and President Reagan may have some differences on dealing with Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, both want the Panamanian leader out of
power.
   Bush said that he isn't discouraged that the administration's
efforts to negotiate an agreement with Noriega collapsed on
Wednesday.
   The vice president, who aides have described as opposed to the
talks, said ``public opinion may be more on the side of the United
States'' as a result of the impasse.
   Although Bush said that he and Reagan ``have had some
differences'' on the subject, the vice president said they share a
common goal.
   ``We have a policy objective of still getting Noriega out of
power,'' he told reporters on Wednesday.
   ``The fact that we haven't solved the problem at this instance
doesn't depress me, because I don't want a bad deal, I want a good
deal,'' he said.
   Addressing a Republican rally in Jersey City on Wednesday night,
the presumed GOP presidential candidate said that, if elected, he
would put his vice president in charge of anti-drug programs ``in a
drug czar-like posture.''
   Bush has called for the death penalty for ``drug kingpins,'' but
has dodged questions on whether this should also apply to Noriega,
who is under indictment in the United States on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Earlier in the day, Bush told reporters in Lakehurst, N.J., that
he was spending two days campaigning in New Jersey, even though he
has the GOP nomination clinched, because he was concerned about
polls showing him trailing the front-runner in the Democratic
presidential race, Michael Dukakis.
   ``We're behind. I'm the underdog. You've seen that in the
polls,'' Bush said.
   However, he later voiced confidence that he would close the gap,
asking: ``Why should I worry about polls in May when the election
is held in November?''
   He suggested that the race on the Democratic side between
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson was giving Dukakis a false image as a
conservative because he comes across as less liberal than Jackson.
   ``It's a blur out there,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, Bush campaign officials said that Peter Teeley, a
longtime Bush adviser, was stepping down from his job as campaign
communications director.
   Campaign Manager Lee Atwater said Teeley would remain with the
campaign but be ``a more creative type guy and work specifically on
the surrogate teams.''
   No further reason was given for the switch, but Teeley was known
to have been at odds recently with Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller.
   Teeley will ``continue on as a senior political adviser,'' said
Bush spokesman Stephen Hart.
   ``As we head into the fall campaign, roles and responsibilities
are going to shift and change. It's the right time for such shifts
to occur,'' Hart said.
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as a shakeup,'' Hart said.
   After a full day of campaigning in the Newark area today, Bush
planned to fly to his vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine,
where he will spend a week in strategy sessions and in meetings on
issues with Republican governors and other GOP leaders.
   In other developments on Wednesday, Bush:
   _Called for naming of an independent counsel to study recent
allegations of financial irregularities surrounding House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas. ``We're going to go after Congress hard and
talk about ethics. If they want to talk about (Attorney General) Ed
Meese, how about talking about the speaker?''
   The allegations concern royalties on a Wright book and his
intervention with federal regulators on behalf of troubled Texas
savings and loan associations.
   _Told a West Point commencement ceremony that a ``liberal
elite'' was jeopardizing the nation's security by failing to
support weapons programs he said were needed. Although he didn't
mention them by name, Bush's comments were apparently aimed at both
Dukakis and Jackson.

   Republican presidential nominee-to-be George Bush called today
for an international strike force to hit ``quick and hard and
often'' at foreign drug operations. Democrats Jesse Jackson and
Michael Dukakis criticized the Reagan administration for its
dealings with Panama's Manuel Noriega.
   Bush sought to recoup from the breakdown of talks aimed at
dislodging Noriega, who faces drug trafficking charges in this
country, with tough talk on drugs during campaign stops in New
Jersey.
   ``Our military forces have already made a substantial
contribution to our interdiction effort and today they're being
called upon to do more. Their primary target should be the
production of drugs abroad,'' Bush said.
   He called for ``an international strike force to hit back, quick
and hard and often, at foreign drug operations'' to stop narcotics
production at the source.
   Bush's comments came during campaign appearances in New Jersey,
one of four states with primaries on June 7. Dukakis and Jackson
concentrated on California, the big prize on that final primary day.
   As the two Democrats debated in San Francisco Wednesday night,
Jackson, who released a five-year budget blueprint this week, urged
Dukakis to spell out his spending plans.
   ``The governor is laying out a budget of promises but not a
budget of numbers,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis replied that his experience as governor of Massachusetts
has taught him that it was a ``serious mistake'' to lay out a
detailed budget plan so far in advance, because the revenue picture
can change drastically.
   Jackson also pressed his rival on policy toward South Africa.
Dukakis advocates putting pressure on the apartheid regime through
economic sanctions; Jackson wants South Africa declared a terrorist
state.
   But the two found little to differ about when it came to
Noriega, and they made certain to bring Bush into it.
   Dukakis attacked Bush's call for the death penalty for drug
kingpins. In light of the Noriega affair, he said, ``I don't know
of anything phonier than that kind of policy.
   ``It's the height of hypocrisy for people in the administration
to be advocating the death penalty for drug pushers while they are
doing business with Noriega and funneling aid to the Contras
through convicted drug dealers,'' said Dukakis, who opposes the
death penalty.
   ``George Bush must answer, how much did he know about Noriega
and drugs, and when?'' Jackson said. As for drug traffickers, he
said: ``Do not deal with them and give them sanctuary and put them
on the CIA payroll.''
   Bush has been treading a fine line on the Noriega affair. He has
acknowledged that the controversy was probably partly to blame for
his slide in the polls against Dukakis, his likely November
opponent.
   ``We're behind. I'm the underdog. You've seen that in the
polls,'' Bush said at a campaign stop in Lakehurst, N.J., on
Wednesday.
   The vice president signalled last week that he disagreed with
President Reagan's handling of the matter. But he did it
discreetly, refusing to even mention Noriega's name.
   When Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced Wednesday
that talks aimed at getting Noriega out had collapsed and no new
ones were planned, Bush responded: ``The fact that we haven't
solved this doesn't depress me.
   ``I don't want a bad deal,'' he said, coming as close as he has
yet to publicly criticizing the administration's apparent readiness
to drop drug charges as part of a deal to get Noriega out.
   ``I want a good deal. ... We'll have to go back and figure it
out,'' he said, expressing optimism that the military leader would
eventually go.
   Aides said last week that Bush had urged that the negotiations
with Noriega be suspended. But on Wednesday, he stressed his unity
with Reagan rather than his differences, saying he and the
president share the ``policy objective of getting Noriega out of
power.''
   Bush was taking the offensive on another controversy, calling
for an independent counsel to investigate possible ethics breaches
by Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright. The Democrats have made
Attorney General Edwin Meese III and his legal woes a campaign
issue.
   ``If they're going to talk about Ed Meese, how about talking
about ... the speaker?'' said Bush. Wright has denied he violated
ethics rules.
   In another development, Bush's campaign communications director,
Peter Teeley, announced he was quitting his post but would stay on
with the campaign in some capacity. Teeley said he had not been
given sufficient access to be an effective spokesman for the
campaign.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis and his aides have been sounding more and
more confident that the June 7 contests will give the Massachusetts
governor the number of delegates needed to nominate.
   ``I think we've got a very good chance of wrapping up this
nomination the first week or two of June,'' he said at a refueling
stop in Des Moines, Iowa, as he flew to California on Wednesday.
``We want to wrap up this nomination, if I can, as soon as
possible.''
   Dukakis is far ahead of Jackson in the delegate race. According
to the latest AP count, he has 1,687 to Jackson's 983, of the 2,081
needed to nominate.
   Dukakis and Jackson met privately after their debate, and
Jackson said the two were ``keenly aware of our joint
responsibility to our party.'' But he also joked that the two
talked about ``trying to balance my ticket with a conservative.''

<HEAD>Delegation Of South African Whites Talks With ANC</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with groups meeting and church
delegation meeting with Kohl. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of white South Africans
met today with four members of the outlawed African National
Congress to seek common ground in the struggle against apartheid.
   In Bonn, meanwhile, South African church leaders demanded in
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl that the Common Market adopt
tough measures to pressure the Pretoria government to dismantle its
race laws.
   Delegation leader Wynand Malan said the eight white delegates
were meeting confidentially with the ANC guerrilla movement to seek
``common ground and strategies.'' Malan is a member of Parliament
and head of the National Democratic Movement.
   The ANC is waging a bombing and sabotage campaign against the
white minority government of South Africa. It is based in Lusaka,
Zambia.
   ANC members at the Frankfurt meeting were Thabo Mbeki, head of
information and publicity; Tony Seedat, the ANC's chief
representative in West Germany; and Aziz Pahad and Jacob Zuma. All
four belong to the ANC's national executive committee.
   Malan told The Associated Press in an interview at a Frankfurt
hotel that the two groups would meet throughout the day.
   ``This is a normal further discussion with the ANC, seeking a
common ground and strategies out of the impasse,'' in South Africa,
Malan said. ``It's the National Democratic Movement's policy to
meet with all political groupings.''
   West Germany was chosen as a meeting site, Malan said, because
it was easy for both sides to get to quickly. Malan said he would
return to South Africa this evening.
   ``The ANC belongs to the essential political forces in South
Africa and is therefore an important dialogue partner,'' Malan told
reporters.
   Among those meeting with Kohl were the Rev. Allan Boesak,
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches; Dr. Christian
Beyers-Naude, former head of the South African Council of Churches;
and Denis Hurley, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Durban.
   The church leaders complained of ``a lack of engagement in
Europe'' toward real attempts to pressure the Pretoria government
for change, according to a statement issued by the group.
   They demanded that European Economic Community nations reduce
the number of their diplomatic personnel in South Africa, place
increased economic pressure on Pretoria, institute stricter visa
requirements for South Africans wishing to visit Western Europe,
and take other measures.
   The group made its demands in Bonn because West Germany holds
the rotating Common Market presidency. The church group was
visiting West Germany separately from the apartheid opponents.
   Tha talks with the ANC were expected to focus on a political
program for anti-apartheid groups that do not participate in South
Africa's tri-cameral Parliament. It has separate chambers for
whites, Asians and people of mixed race, but there is no
representation for the nation's 26 million black majority.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the blacks have no vote in South African national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   NATO's chief military adviser said
today the U.S.-Soviet treaty to remove ground-launched,
intermediate-range nuclear missiles means NATO's conventional
forces must be improved.
   West German Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg, chairman of NATO's panel of
chiefs of staff, said he has found no evidence the Soviet Union
will cut back its military.
   ``They (the Soviets) are not able to define in which way their
strategy has changed from an admittedly offensive to a presently
defensive strategy,'' he said.
   Altenburg spoke after giving NATO defense ministers, at their
regular spring conference, a routine briefing on Soviet military
capabilities.
   He also predicted the NATO allies will formally ask Italy to
accept the transfer of 72 U.S. F-16 jetfighters that are to be
removed from Spain within three years.
   Sources said the ministers discussed how the transfer, estimated
to cost $500 million, should be funded. Altenburg said this would
likely be done through NATO's joint infrastructure program.
   ``I am quite sure that all members of the alliance agree that we
do this economically.''
   The 72 jetfighters, comprising the U.S. Air Force's 401st
Tactical Fighter Wing, are to be removed from the Torrejon Air Base
near Madrid under a January agreement between Spain and the United
States.
   Altenburg said the Soviet Union still views NATO as an offensive
alliance and that it shows no signs of reducing its military
outlays. ``There is no evidence whatsoever in that respect that
things have really changed.''
   He added that unabated growth in Soviet military outlays were
linked to the treaty under which hundreds of intermediate-range
nuclear missiles will be removed from Europe.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the
treaty Dec. 8 in Washington.
   ``We think that after the INF treaty, the need to maintain our
conventional posture ... is more important than ever,'' he said.
   U.S Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and his NATO colleagues
were meeting to review how the allies must share their common
defense costs and ways they can make better use of available funds.
   On Wednesday, the alliance's European defense chiefs complained
that some of the recent U.S. criticism about their contributions to
the alliance was unjustified.
   In a report, the ministers detailed their contributions to NATO,
countering U.S. congressional criticism that Europe fails to pull
its weight in the alliance.
   ``Europe is taking a fair share of the burdens in the
alliance,'' Dutch Defense Minister Wim van Eekelen, chairman of the
meeting of the European ministers, said later.
   The debate over who pays what in NATO stems from congressional
efforts to curb U.S. defense spending.
   The Europeans' report said that of NATO's standing forces,
Europe provides 90 percent of the troops and artillery, 80 percent
of the tanks and combat planes and 65 percent of NATO warships.
   It said 3.5 million European men and women are on active duty
and 3.5 million are in reserve. By comparison, the United States
has 2.3 million active duty troops and 1.5 million reservists, the
report said.
   In their report, NATO's European members agreed all allies must
do more for NATO, in part by better managing their budgets.
   The United States spent 6.7 percent of its gross national
product on defense in 1987 against an average of 3.3 percent for
the European allies.
   The Europeans argue the spending comparisons ignore
unquantifiable burdens for them, such as environmental damage from
allied maneuvers and loss of income from real estate dedicated to
military bases and other defense facilities.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Investigating Medical Examiner's Office Over Sale of
Bones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The county's chief medical examiner is
the target of an investigation into allegations he improperly
earned more than $100,000 selling bones from the dead, the San
Antonio Light reported today.
   The Light said an unidentified source provided documents
detailing the sale of hundreds of bones since 1983 by Bexar County
Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Vincent DiMaio's.
   The bones, obtained from bodies taken to the county morgue, went
to the non-profit Bone Bank Foundation of San Antonio, where they
were cleaned, chopped into pieces and freeze-dried for
transplantation, mostly for back, dental or reconstructive surgery,
the newspaper reported.
   Survivors of the dead gave their consent, thinking the bones
were ``gifts of life'' to the foundation, but DiMaio charged up to
$200 for each bone removed, the Light reported.
   A secretary in DiMaio's office today said he would be out of the
office until next week.
   The alleged sideline business is under investigation by the
district attorney's office, the newspaper said.
   The investigation focuses on whether DiMaio legally could charge
the fees if he was extracting the bones on county time and using
county facilities and employees, a source outside the district
attorney's office told the Light.
   The newspaper said invoices it obtained indicate the foundation
paid DiMaio up to $10,000 per month for bones, but none of those
payments went to the county.
   The county has a formal agreement with the Bone Bank Foundation
to be paid $25 for every donor to cover basic organ-harvesting
costs.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. today said the Jan. 2 fuel
tank collapse that fouled two major rivers and contaminated
drinking water in three states resulted from a dime-size flaw in
the tank's nearly 50-year-old steel.
   A crack emanated from the flaw as workers were filling the
4-million-gallon tank at Ashland's Floreffe Terminal south of here
in freezing temperatures, Ashland said, citing a report it
commissioned from the Battelle Memorial Institute of Columbus, Ohio.
   Steel plate of that era lacked the toughness of modern steel and
was made more brittle by the cold weather, Ashland said at a news
conference.
   The wall gave way under the pressure of 3.8 million gallons of
diesel fuel, and an estimated 713,000 gallons entered the
Monongahela River.
   The spill forced communities downstream along the Monongahela
and Ohio rivers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to close
their drinking water intakes.
   About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents were without tap
water for most of the week because their water system lacked
adequate reserves.
   The steel was flawed before the plates were welded to make a
tank at an Ashland terminal near Cleveland around 1940, Ray Mesloh,
head of the Battelle investigators, said in a report.
   The original welding and welds made when the tank was cut apart
and reassembled near Pittsburgh in 1986 made the steel more brittle
around the flaw in the bottom row of plates in the tank's circular
wall, he said.
   ``These factors, combined with cold temperatures and the stress
placed on the tank as it was being filled near capacity created the
conditions required for brittle fracture,'' Mesloh said in the
report.
   X-rays of the welds made during the reconstruction showed some
of the joints did not meet construction standards, but tests
performed by Battelle indicated the welds were nonetheless stronger
than the steel plate, Ashland said.
   Battelle also found that the steel had not deteriorated over
time.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Gets Formal Complaint To Investigate Wright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich filed a formal
complaint with the House ethics committee today asking for an
investigation to determine if House Speaker Jim Wright violated
House ethics rules.
   Gingrich's complaint, which was accompanied by a supporting
letter signed by 71 House Republicans, asked for an investigation
in four areas, including published reports that Wright received
unusually high royalities of 55 percent from his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   Common Cause, which calls itself a citizens lobby, urged the
ethics committee last week to launch an investigation of Wright.
While the panel was not required legally to respond to that
request, Gingrich's complaint will require a formal vote on whether
to launch an investigation.
   Wright's book was published by a printing company that received
nearly $300,000 in business from his campaign committee in 1985-86,
the complaint said in asking for an investigation into whether
Wright converted campaign funds from the sale of his book to his
personal gain.
   The complaint also cited reports of Wright's 1979 intervention
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in behalf of a businessman who
earlier had allowed Wright to invest in a proven oil well, and 1980
reports that Wright intervened with the Department of Interior to
influence a gas lease decision involving a company in which Wright
owned $15,000 worth of stock.
   ``The volume of published evidence clearly calls for
investigation,'' said Gingrich, a leader of Republican
conservatives in the House who before today had waged a solitary
year-long ethics campaign against Wright.
   Wright was asked what he thought of Gingrich and said his views
of the conservative Georgia congressman ``are similar to those of a
fire hydrant toward dogs.''
   Wright sent a letter to Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of
the ethics committee, on Wednesday promising his full cooperation
if the panel, made up of six Democrats and six Republicans, decided
to investigate him.
   ``I feel certain I have not violated any House rules,'' Wright
said today. ``I most certainly have never intended to do so.''
   Wright said he hopes the ethics panel will resolve the matter
promptly and ``if they find that I have violated some rule, just
say so... and have it done so it doesn't become an encumbrance...
an embarassment'' to the Democrats.
   Wright accused Gingrich of timing his complaint so that the
ethics investigation would coincide with the Democratic National
Convention, which Wright is scheduled to chair.
   Gingrich, who has been calling for an investigation of Wright
since last December, denied that the complaint was timed to detract
attention from Democratic efforts to use the ethics issue against
Vice President George Bush in the presidential campaign.
   Gingrich said, however, that Bush aides have been meeting with
his staff over the past seven to eight weeks to discuss Gingrich's
ethics campaign against Wright. He also said he has been getting
``supportive comments'' privately from the White House for the past
three months.
   On Wednesday, Bush called for the naming of an independent
counsel to study allegations of financial irregularities
surrounding Wright.

<HEAD>Playpens Sold Nationwide May Pose Danger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Certain ``Circus America'' playpens, sold
nationwide, pose the danger of crushing children's fingers and may
present a smothering hazard if not used correctly, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission said today.
   The soft, mesh-sided playpens sold for about $90. They can be
identified by a self-adhesive label on the floorboard, stating
``Art. 585, Circus America Ex.''
   About 2,500 of the playpens have been sold since 1984. They were
imported from Italy by C&T International, Inc., of Moonachie, N.J.
   According to the Safety Commission, the design of these playpens
presents the possibility of a child's fingers being crushed in the
drop sides. Also, if the sides are left folded down, an infant
could fall into the loose mesh and suffocate, the agency said.
   No deaths or injuries have been reported involving Circus
America playpens, but some have occurred involving other playpens
of similar design, the commission said.
   C&T is offering a free modification kit including a warning
label explaining how to avoid the suffocation danger and plastic
inserts to prevent the possibility of finger crushing. The kit also
includes replacement plastic for the playpen, since the Commission
is concerned that the removable feet provided originally could pose
a choking hazard for children.
   Consumers can obtain the modification kits by calling C&T at

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case said today
that the congressional immunity granted Oliver L. North and two
co-defendands could make trying the three on conspiracy charges a
``practical impossibility.''
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell raised the problem at a
hearing on the difficulty resulting from immunized testimony given
to Congress by North, a former National Security Council staff
member; former presidential National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter, and businessman Albert Hakim.
   Gesell made no ruling on the question of proceeding with trial
and is not expected to for some time.
   But the judge told attorneys in the case that under normal trial
procedures, a defendant could take the stand and be questioned by a
co-defendant about testimony given earlier to Congress.
   Inthis case, Gesell said, none of the statements given Congress
under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution can be used at
trial.
   ``As I see it, it is a practical impossibility to try the
conspiracy counts ...'' Gesell said. ``If you try them (the
defendants) together, you violate the immunities.''
   Gesell said separate trials also would raise a problem because
the defendants might not be able to call each other as witnesses to
defend their own positions. For instance, Poindexter could refuse
to testify that he authorized North's activities in the Iran-Contra
affair if subpoenaed by North's lawyers.
   North, Poindexter, Hakim and businessman Richard V. Secord are
charged with conspiring to turn a lawful presidential directive to
sell arms to Iran into an illegal enterprise, which included
profiting from the weapons sales and assistance to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels during a ban on such aid. Secord did not testify
under an immunity grant.
   Barry Simon, attorney for North, argued at the hearing that the
case should not go forward because the prosecution staff of
Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and grand jury witnesses were
exposed to the immunized testimony.
   ``Their testimony is being used against them,'' Simon said.
``There's no way of unscrambling that problem. It is a problem that
absolutely prevades the case.
   ``You can't unscramble what witnesses now know after what they
had seen and heard from immunized testimony, and what they (knew)
before.''
   While the conspiracy counts are the main charges, other charges
against the three include theft of government property, acceptance
of an illegal gratuity, obstruction of a congressional
investigation, false statements to Congress and obstruction of a
presidential inquiry.
   At an earlier hearing, Gesell said it also could be difficult to
proceed to trial unless the government made available to the
defense thousands of classified documents in the case.
   Federal officials have been sending those documents on a regular
basis to a secure facility rented by the federal government for the
use of the defendants.
   Gesell did not say at today's hearing whether he remains as
concerned about the classified document problem as he had been.

   A bomb exploded today outside the home of a woman
organizing a controversial conference on the future of U.S.-Cuba
relations. No one was hurt.
   The hotel hosting the forum immediately canceled it.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast at the home of Maria
Christina Herrera.
   Ms. Herrera, who has favored dialogue with the Cuban government,
said it appeared to be the work of anti-Castro militants.
   The 3 a.m. bombing mangled a garage door, damaged the corner of
the house and blew out the windows of a rental car parked in her
driveway.
   The bombing came 2{ hours after a meeting at Ms. Herrera's house
ended early today with the conference organizers deciding to
exclude a representative of the unofficial Cuban Human Rights
Commission, Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz. He is a former political
prisoner who was given permission by the Castro government to set
up his organization, making him suspect among anti-communists here.
   Bill Ripple, general manager of the Sheraton-Brickell Point
Hotel, said the hotel canceled today's conference ``based on the
best interests of our employees and guests because of the recent
incidents, including the bombing.''
   A demonstration against the conference had been scheduled across
the street.
   Ms. Herrera, 53, is a professor at Miami-Dade Community College
and a founder of the Institute of Cuban Studies, an organization
dedicated to the free exchange of ideas with Cuba. She said she
wanted the conference to go on as planned.
   ``This was only to intimidate,'' she said. ``If they had wanted
to hurt me, they would have thrown it through my bedroom window.''
   The bomb was a ``relatively small explosive device,'' said Coral
Gables police Sgt. Dennis Koronkiewicz.
   FBI spokesman Dennis Erich said the agency is investigating.

   Catholic educators, still facing a retreat
in parochial school enrollment, are looking toward a future in
which religious education programs outside school loom even larger.
   Indeed, at a week-long symposium on the future of Catholic
education that ends today, most of the discussion centered on
programs that reach out to children and adults outside the
traditional school structure.
   There was virtually no debate at the Catholic Education Futures
Project sessions about how to stem the erosion of parochial
schools, which lost 110 more schools and 103,000 students last year
alone. There are now 2.6 million students in 8,992 Catholic
schools, down from a peak of 5.6 million in more than 13,000
schools in 1964.
   Even before adjourning, the nearly 300 educators at the
conference had decided against trying to finish writing a ``vision
statement'' on their church's educational mission for the next
century.
   But asked to identify the most important elements of Catholic
education, they gave strongest support to the declaration,
``Catholic education exists to proclaim the gospel, to promote
lifelong personal growth and faith formation of all peoples, and to
support the mission of the church.''
   Other priority items included promoting ``respect for all
cultures which make up our pluralistic society,'' eliminating
sexism and racism, paying particular concern to education of the
poor, and making better use of ``our changing resources.''
   The actual writing of the final document was to done later by
representatives of the 22 church groups at the meeting held at the
University of Dayton.
   Only a quarter of the educators at the symposium are involved in
parochial schools. Others work with young adults, converts, college
students and Catholic children from public school.
   Historically, the public school child who attended weekly
religion classes ``was considered a second class citizen,'' said
Bishop James Malone of Youngstown.
   But now, archdioceses around the country are installing paid,
full-time directors of religious education, like Janet Kayser, a
laywoman who runs the programs for St. Thomas Parish in Crystal
Lake, Ill.
   ``When the topic of Catholic education comes up, there's too
much emphasis in thinking it means only schools,'' said Kayser, who
has 650 students in her programs.
   In some places, she said, ``there has been a real injustice in
balancing'' between the needs of the school and the religious
education program.
   The Rev. Thomas Lynch, pastor of St. James Church in Bridgeport,
Conn., said only 280 of the 2,900 families in his parish send
children to the parochial school, but the school, with a $530,000
budget, consumes half the parish revenues.
   Lynch is trying to rename the school the St. James Center for
Religious Formation to stress some of his parish's prayer classes,
scripture study and other educational activities, but he admits his
parishioners ``get nervous'' about such a change.
   Lynch said Catholic schools must emphasize the teaching of faith
``just as much as geography, math or anything else.'' There is no
reason to operate a parochial school that ``smells like and looks
like the public school except for maybe a course in religion and an
amorphous Catholic environment,'' he said.
   Bishop Francis Schulte of West Virginia, who heads the bishops'
committee on education, said in an interview, ``I believe there's
no adequate substitute for the full curriculum Catholic school.''
But he acknowledged that there are ``very substantial areas'' where
Catholic parents simply don't have a parochial school available.
   To those who would like to see the church shift more resources
into other religion education efforts, Schulte said, ``There's a
fallacy ... that if the Catholic school was not present in a
parish, then all or most of that money would then go into other
educational programs.'' Most of the money is in the form of tuition
that would disappear with the school, he said.
   Parochial schools flourished in big cities with immigrants from
Catholic lands like Ireland, Italy and Poland. When Catholics
became more affluent and moved to the suburbs, churches followed,
but schools did not.
   ``We have buildings in places where we don't have Catholic
children, and we have Catholic children in places where we don't
have schools,'' said Sister Lourdes Sheehan, of the National
Catholic Educational Association, a sponsor of the symposium.
   Malone said, ``The genius of the meeting has to be to affirm the
continued importance and place of the Catholic school ... but then
acknowledge generously and fully that these other activities and
ministries are a part of Catholic education.''
   ``Ideally, the Catholic school is the best vehicle we've had for
helping parents teach values in the Catholic tradition,'' said
Malone.
   But ``we've never had more than 50 percent of our kids in
Catholic schools,'' he added. ``What happens if you can't have a
Cadillac, you certainly find out you can fix up the Volkswagen
pretty well and get along with that.''

   Bomb squad officers today removed a
suspicious-looking canister from a Department of Health and Human
Services office down the hall from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's and
later determined it was not a bomb, police said.
   Police destroyed the device at Moon Island in Boston Harbor with
a high-pressure water cannon, said police spokesman Jim Jordan.
   ``Presumably, if it was a bomb, it would have exploded, and it
didn't,'' Jordan said. ``It wasn't a bomb.''
   He said police had not immediately determined what the device
found at a federal building downtown was.
   Kennedy was in Washington at the time, said a spokesman for the
Massachusetts Democrat at his U.S. Capitol office.
   The FBI, HHS employees and Kennedy's staff said the device, a
metal canister in a paper bag, was found several offices and about
15 yards away from Kennedy's office on the 24th floor of the John
F. Kennedy federal building.
   An HHS employee who refused to give her name said she and fellow
workers discovered the bag on a coat rack shortly before 7:30 a.m.
The woman said she called federal police in the building and was
told to evacuate the office.
   ``I only saw it from the top,'' she said. ``I've worked here
long enough to be suspicious of paper bags.'' Employees said bomb
scares occur often at the building.
   FBI spokesman Jack Cloherty said an occupant of the HHS office
had reported ``something in a paper bag that looked like it had
electrical components.''
   Workers at Kennedy's office were allowed to return soon
afterward.

   Wall Street reacted skeptically today to
financier Carl C. Icahn's offer to buy Texaco Inc., pushing the oil
company's stock higher but still well below the $60 a share he's
touting.
   The stock rose $4 to $50.87{ on the New York Stock Exchange, one
day after Texaco's largest investor disclosed the cash offer that
values the company at $14.6 billion. Texaco called the proposal a
phony ``bear hug'' pressure ploy.
   Icahn, who bought Trans World Airlines and has chased other big
companies such as USX Corp., publicized the offer shortly after
Texaco management scrapped talks with him over how to restructure
following its emergence from bankruptcy court reorganization in
April.
   He disclosed the offer late Wednesday in a letter to Texaco
management.
   Icahn has amassed a 14.8 percent stake in the nation's
third-largest oil company, and has been seeking the most profitable
way to exploit it.
   Earlier this month, Icahn, who has said Texaco would be worth
more broken up and sold, threatened a shareholder proxy fight to
install five allies on its board. The company responded by suing
him for alleged securities fraud.
   They began peace talks about three weeks ago. Texaco President
James Kinnear said the company terminated the discussions Wednesday
because of what he called Icahn's unreasonable demands for special
treatment in a restructuring.
   ``Texaco will not be bullied or cajoled into recommending to its
shareholders a transaction that is not in their best interest or
the best interest of the company,'' Kinnear said.
   Icahn spokesman Daniel H. Burch said Texaco made a ``totally
inaccurate characterization of the negotiations.''
   ``He at all times sought a restructuring that would treat all
stockholders equally,'' Burch said. ``We've now proposed a $60 cash
merger that does treat all shareholders equally.''
   Of 243 Texaco shares outstanding, Icahn owns about 36 million,
for which he paid an average $34 each or about $1.22 billion.
Combined with the $12.42 billion he offered to pay for the rest,
the total offer is worth about $13.64 billion.
   If completed, such an offer would be the biggest in corporate
history. The previous record was the 1984 $13.4 billion acquisition
of Gulf Corp. by Standard Oil Co. of California, now Chevron Corp.
   Icahn said in his letter that he would drop the proxy contest if
management would allow other stockholders to consider the offer. He
gave management until 5 p.m. Friday to think it over.
   He provided few other details, but said part of his financing
plan would include the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. and Caltex, two
of Texaco's most prized assets.
   ``However, we intend to maintain Texaco's core business and
return it to its rightful place as a leader in its industry, just
as we have done with TWA,'' Icahn said.
   Texaco spokeswoman Anita Larsen called Icahn's proposal ``an
illusory offer which so far as Texaco has seen, provides absolutely
no details regarding financing, disappears in less than 48 hours,
and is put forward as an alternative to allow him to avoid the
proxy contest with which he has been threatening the company.''
   ``Just a few hours ago he was demanding that Texaco help him
unload the shares he already owns,'' she said.
   Company sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Icahn
had been hinting at such a move since talks began, and that Kinnear
regarded it as a desperate ploy.
   ``He's been threatening that kind of bear hug,'' said one source.
   Nevertheless, Icahn said in his letter that he was so sure he
could obtain financing that he would place $100 million in escrow
and forfeit it to Texaco if he failed to get commitments by the
annual shareholders meeting.
   Texaco said that in accordance with an agreement with Icahn it
would delay that meeting from June 7 to June 17, unless the
financier withdrew his board slate.
   Icahn's offer came after the close of trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, where Texaco shares rose $1 to $46.87{. The stock
had been falling steadily since the negotiations began.
   Analysts have estimated the company would be worth between $60
and $80 a share if it was broken up and sold.
   Icahn's offer was the latest chapter in a troubled Texaco saga
that began when smaller rival Pennzoil Co. won a $10.5 billion
judgment against it in 1985, eventually driving Texaco into
bankruptcy court 13 months ago as part of a strategy to save itself.
   Texaco emerged from bankruptcy in April after settling with
Pennzoil by paying it $3 billion and announcing a drastic
restructuring plan that includes the sale of about $5 billion in
assets.

   U.S. diplomats began a round of consultations
with Latin American governments today in a search for new options
on bringing about the departure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from
Panama, a State Department official said.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said U.S.
ambassadors were instructed to seek advice from the presidents and
the foreign ministers of their respective countries.
   Abrams spoke to reporters after a closed-door meeting of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the failed
administration attempt to negotiate Noriega's resignation as
defense chief and his departure from Panama.
   ``We begin today a round of consultations with democracies
throughout Latin America,'' Abrams said. ``Cables went out last
night instructing our ambassadors to see the presidents of their
host countries today and the foreign ministers and to tell them
what happened in detail and to ask for their advice in helping us
move forward.''
   Republican and Democratic senators hailed the collapse of U.S.
efforts to negotiate Noriega's departure, and the country's
anti-Noriega ambassador said today the United States should let
Latin Americans solve the problem.
   ``A lot of people are not upset that it fell apart,'' said Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., the morning after Secretary of State George
Shultz told a hastily arranged news conference that Noreiga had
rejected U.S. proposals for his resignation as defense chief and
his temporary departure from Panama.
   But Kerry said, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' that the negotiations to oust Noriega hurt U.S. foreign
policy ``and also sent a terrible message with respect to our
ability to do something about the narcotics traffic.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., on ``CBS This Morning,'' urged
the administration to start working with Latin American leaders on
the matter and said no options for dealing with Noriega should be
ruled out.
   Dodd urged Panamanians to ``keep pressure on General Noriega to
realize that he's not safe when he leaves his country and not
secure at home either.''
   Ambassador Juan Sosa said on CBS, ``The United States should
hold back and let other initiatives go forward.''
   Sosa said the Reagan administration negotiated in good faith but
should not have dealt with a terrorist. ``The problem is Noriega is
not an honorable person,'' he said.
   In another appearance, on NBC-TV's ``Today,'' Sosa said, ``I
suggest that other initiatives, diplomatic initiatives, political
initiatives that are on the drawing boards and are initiatives that
Panamanians are putting together with other Latin American
countries be given a chance, although I still doubt that Noriega
has any intention whatsoever of relinquishing power.''
   Reaction to the collapse of the negotiations came as no suprise
since criticism of the administration's stand had been widespread
well before Shultz's announcement. The critics included Vice
President George Bush, Justice Department officials, Panamanian
opposition leaders and 86 senators.
   Perhaps the most biting comment was made by Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., who expressed no regret at all for the administration's
negotiations failure.
   ``This administration negotiates with the darndest people _
Iranian terrorists and Panamanian drug dealers,'' Cranston said.
``I think we should have an administration which doesn't negotiate
with people like that.
   ``This administration has handled the Noriega situation so badly
that it is an embarrassment to the United States.''
   After the negotiations broke down, President Reagan ordered the
return of State Department envoy Michael Kozak to Washington.
Shultz said that the negotiating package, worked out laboriously
between Kozak and Panamanian officials in the last few weeks, has
been scrapped.
   ``No further negotiations are contemplated,'' Shultz said. ``All
proposals addressed during these negotiations have been withdrawn.
No offers remain on the table.''
   Shultz refused comment when asked if military solutions are
being contemplated. But at the Pentagon, officials insisted there
were no plans afoot for direct military intervention in Panama.
   For much of the day Wednesday, a deal seemed to be within reach.
But Kozak telephoned the State Department at 4 p.m. EDT to pass
along the news of Noriega's decision.
   ``At the final moment in negotiations, Noriega would not carry
through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated,''
Shultz told reporters.
   Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost said Noriega had
indicated that ``majors and captains'' within Panama's Defense
Forces ``might take strong action'' against him if he agreed to the
deal.
   Bush, who has expressed some misgivings at the Reagan
administration's negotiations with Noriega, on Wednesday said that
he still was optimistic that Noriega could be persuaded to step
down.
   ``I'm convinced Noriega will be out of power,'' Bush told
reporters in Lakehurst, N.J. ``The fact that we haven't solved this
doesn't depress me.
   ``I don't want a bad deal. I want a good deal. We'll have to go
back and figure it out.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said that he
welcomed Shultz's announcement. ``Noriega must go if we are to
achieve our goals in Panama. But sending Noriega off into
retirement with a legal golden parachute ... would have been the
wrong step at the wrong time.''
   This was a reference to the most controversial aspect of the
administration's proposal: dismissing federal drug smuggling
indictments against Noriega.
   In February, two federal grand juries in Florida indicted
Noriega on charges of taking at least $4.6 million in payoffs from
a drug ring based in Medellin, Colombia, to protect cocaine
shipments, launder money and hide drug smugglers from law
enforcement officials.
   In return for the withdrawal of the indictments, Noriega was to
step down as commander of the Defense Forces in August and go into
exile until after elections for a civilian-led government were held
in May 1989.
   The State Department's view throughout the negotiations was that
dismissal of the indictments against Noriega was a small price to
pay for his departure from Panama and the restoration of democratic
rule.

   Two bombs exploded in downtown
Pretoria today and injured four whites as the National Party marked
40 years in power. A Cabinet minster blamed the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The attacks in the South African capital coincided with
anniversary celebrations by President P.W. Botha's party,
responsible for the country's apartheid legislation. The National
Party has led the government since the whites-only election of May
26, 1948.
   Four white women, all librarians in their 30s, were returning
from lunch when a bomb exploded in a flowerpot at a busy street
corner.
   One woman lost an arm, a second suffered back injuries and the
other two had extensive facial burns, according to a statement from
H.F. Verwoerd Hospital.
   About five minutes earlier, a bomb placed under a parked car
exploded several blocks away. The car was completely destroyed, but
there were no injuries.
   Witnesses said earlier that at least five people were injured in
one blast and that one or two may have been killed, but there was
no confirmation of fatalities.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok blamed the African National Congress, which
wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the
white-led government.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, generally does not confirm or
deny any role in the attacks.
   Vlok also condemned a trip by white South African anti-apartheid
politicians who are meeting today and Friday with ANC leaders in
Frankfurt, West Germany. The group is led by Wynand Malan, a member
of Parliament and leader of the National Democratic Movement.
   Vlok said it was ``ironic'' that bombings were taking place at
the same time ``people such as Wynand Malan ... are busy holding
talks with this unscrupulous terror organization.''
   The government opposes all contact with the ANC and says it will
not negotiate with the organization until it disavows violence.
   There have been more than 70 bomb blasts in South Africa since a
nationwide state of emergency was declared in June 1986, although
the number of explosions has fallen sharply in the past year.
   The police have blamed virtually all the blasts on the ANC.
   The ANC did claim responsibility for deadliest bombing in South
African history. The May 20, 1983, blast in Pretoria killed 19 and
injured about 200.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A 13-year-old who found a wallet stuffed
with $4,000 on a bus bench treated himself to a six-day adventure
at Disneyland, police said.
   The boy told police he had ``a ball,'' Costa Mesa Detective Paul
Cappuccilli said Wednesday.
   The boy, who was identified only as a resident of nearby Garden
Grove because of his age, found the money May 13 and rented a
$35-a-night motel room in his own name near Disneyland for nine
days from May 13-21, Cappuccilli said.
   He spent the next three days at Disneyland, buying two
skateboards, a watch, a camera and film, a gym bag and new clothes.
On his fourth day at the amusement park, the boy lost the $2,800 he
had left, the detective said.
   The next day, a 30-year-old man befriended the boy at the park
and took him to a car dealership where an employee called police.
The boy's parents, who had filed a missing persons report, were
reunited with their son May 18, Cappuccilli said.
   ``The boy knew he probably should have returned the money but
said he was having some problems at home and was planning to run
away,'' the detective said.

   Authorities don't suspect foul play in the death
of a 79-year-old woman but will exhume her remains more than a
month after the funeral on a technicality _ she was buried without
a signed death certificate.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Kenneth Gillis ordered the exhumation
and an autopsy because the burial of Marie R. Drake was illegal and
her estate can't be closed without a death certificate, officials
said Wednesday.
   ``Imagine putting yourself in the children's position _ having
buried their mother a month ago and then suddenly finding out the
death certificate was never signed,'' said Elliott Robbins, an
attorney for Mrs. Drake's children, Ronald Drake and Marion Sottile.
   ``They thought they had laid their mother to rest and now she
has to be dragged up again,'' he said Wednesday. ``It's a very,
very gut-wrenching experience. I don't know how this could have
happened.''
   Mrs. Drake was found dead, apparently of natural causes, in her
home in suburban Elmwood Park on April 14, a Thursday, said Sean
Fitzgerald, an assistant Cook County state's attorney.
   The county medical examiner's office was not called because
police didn't suspect foul play, and the family doctor was expected
to sign the death certificate, said Roy Dames, administrator in the
examiner's office.
   But the funeral home couldn't get in touch with the doctor over
the weekend and a funeral was planned for Monday morning, said
funeral director Steven Lewis.
   Lewis said that he knew that burying a body without a death
certificate is a violation of the law but that the funeral home
decided to proceed with the funeral anyway, believing the doctor
would sign the document after the fact.
   However, Dr. Charles Shallat refused to sign, apparently because
he hadn't seen Mrs. Drake as a patient in four years, said
Fitzgerald. Shallat did not return a message left with his
answering service Wednesday.
   The family didn't discover the problem until they began trying
to settle her estate in county Probate Court, said Robbins.
   Like the doctor, the medical examiner's office refused to sign
the certificate without inspecting the body.
   ``We can't tell what the cause of death is without looking at
the body. She might have a gunshot wound to the head for all I
know,'' said Dames.
   Fitzgerald said he didn't know whether charges would be filed
against the funeral home.

<TEXT>
   A strike of ferryboat workers has brought
bitter division to this old English Channel port under the famed
White Cliffs.
   A vast majority of the Dover seamen of P and O European Ferries,
the largest English Channel ferry operator, voted Feb. 2 to strike
over new work practices the company wanted to impose.
   Nearly four months later the walkout remains unresolved, and the
2,220 workers are bitterly divided.
   One side decided in late April to defy the National Union of
Seamen and accept a revised P and O proposal to return to work.
   The men and women who chose to stay out lost their jobs.
   Some of those who returned to work have found the word ``Scab''
scrawled in red paint on their homes. Others have reported
receiving threatening, anonymous telephone calls.
   Brian Young, mayor of the city of about 40,000 people, fears
Dover will feel the pain longer after the strike is settled.
   ``You're going to get splits in the community'' he said.
``People are having to make hard decisions.
   ``People rely on each other in an emergency out there when there
is a 10-force gale,'' he added. ``People will remember who didn't
back them up in a strike.''
   P and O, which is refusing further negotiations with the union,
says 1,100 former strikers are back on the job. The union says it's
only 250.
   Violence broke out on the picket lines April 29, when P and O
operated two of its 11 ferries with strikebreaking crews.
   The company says it now is operating five vessels, two carrying
passengers and three carrying freight, and has brought its work
force back to 65 percent of its previous level by hiring from a
pool of 8,000 outsiders.
   ``What has happened here is a tragedy,'' said striker Steve
Bartlett. ``I won't speak to them (the strikebreakers) ever again.
They betrayed us. They are traitors.''
   The strikers say they won't accept the new work rules _ namely
more shifts _on grounds that they jeopardize ferry safety.
   The loss of 193 lives, including ferry crewmen, in last year's
sinking of the P and O's Herald of Free Enterprise off Zeebrugge,
Belgium, had a profound effect on Dover, whose principal industry
is its port, which goes back to Roman times.
   But P and O insists nothing in its work proposals is unsafe and
that safety is a paramount issue with the company.
   P and O maintains it needs the new work practices to make it
more competitive with the new English Channel rail tunnel, which
will offer speedier travel between England and France when it opens
in 1993.
   The strikers, however, believe P and O is trying to destroy
their union with the backing of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government.
   Dover residents who support the opposition Labor Party feel
intensely that the chairman of the parent P and O Steam Navigation
Co., Sir Jeffrey Sterling, has benefitted from Mrs. Thatcher's
capitalist policies.
   Although Dover's economy has been hurt by the walkout, large
segments of the community appear to back the strikers.
   ``It's always been a seafaring town, so these seamen have a lot
of support,'' said James Moore, a taxi driver.
   Mayor Young said shopkeepers donate food to the strikers, who
have set up soup kitchens to guarantee that the seamen and their
families get at least one hot meal a day.
   The seamen, who made the equivalent of $20,500 to $31,600 a
year, are having to make do now with a total of about $372 in
strike payments from their union.
   Crewmen who have gone back to work avoid talking about it to
reporters.
   ``There are too many reprisals,'' said the wife of one,
shrinking away from her front door.
   The first crews to go back to work issued a statement saying
their decision was based on a desire to save the company from being
sold to foreigners, that they didn't want outsiders to get their
jobs and that the strike was undemocratic.
   Hundreds of picketers still wait at the entrance of the docks
every morning for company buses ferrying strikebreakers.
   Shouting with fists raised, they have persuaded a handful of
workers, a few of them in tears, to get off and join them on the
picket line.

<HEAD>30 Tamil Rebels Die In Indian Army Offensive In Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian troops backed by helicopter
gunships attacked Tamil rebel camps in northern Sri Lanka on
Thursday in an offensive that has killed 30 rebels and 10 soldiers,
an Indian official said.
   The United News of India news agency said 6,000 Indian troops
were involved in the offensive, which began Tuesday near the
fishing village of Mullaitivu, 170 miles northeast of Colombo.
   An official at the Indian High Commission said at least 30 Tamil
fighters were killed and 39 injured since Tuesday. The official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 10 Indian troops were
killed and 21 wounded in the operation.
   In a radio broadcast, Tamils put the rebel death toll at eight.
One rebel spokesman, whose uses the nom de guerre Dinesh, said that
25 Indian soldiers had been killed.
   The figures could not be independently verified because
communications with the town have been cut.
   ``The operation ... is still on,'' the Indian official said.
   The rebels, who are fighting for an independent Tamil homeland,
have used the village as a smuggling base, Indian officials said.
   The offensive was the largest India has launched since Oct. 10,
when Indian troops fought two weeks to capture the northern Jaffna
Peninsula from the rebels.
   India has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to enforce
an Indian-sponsored peace accord signed July 29. The pact signed by
India and Sri Lanka was aimed at ending a nearly five-year
insurgency by Tamil rebels.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population, claim they are discriminated against
by the majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and
the military.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest rebel group,
has rejected the peace accord and vowed to continue its guerrilla
struggle for an independent homeland in the north and east of the
island, where most Tamils live.
   The Tigers have been operating from jungle bases since the
Jaffna offensive and still conduct hit-and-run raids on the Indian
forces.
   India is involved because its own 60 million ethnic Tamils are
sympathetic to their Sri Lankan brethren.
   Before the latest offensive, more than 435 Indian soldiers had
died since the troops were sent to the island July 30.

   Federal inspectors are testing seat belts
on a Braniff airliner that reportedly snapped or loosened, injuring
four passengers, when the aircraft was buffeted by stormy weather
near Orlando.
   The belts will be tested to determine whether they were faulty
or improperly installed, said Jeff Kennedy, air safety investigator
with the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Three adults and a baby carried by one of them were treated at
an Orlando hospital Tuesday for minor injuries after the landing of
the twin-engine BAC-111, Braniff Flight 723 from Indianapolis to
Orlando.
   ``Seat belts coming loose _ that's not common,'' Kennedy said
Wednesday.
   Braniff said the aircraft was inspected and returned to service
Wednesday.
   Jack Barker, spokesman for the FAA in Atlanta, said the company
was responsible for replacing the three seat belts and inspecting
remaining safety belts before allowing the plane to fly again.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush is likely to
benefit only indirectly from President Reagan's summit next week
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, scholars and political
observers say.
   Whereas Bush had a role in the Washington summit last December,
the vice president will be far from the Moscow drama, meeting
privately with Republican Party leaders at his home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Bush, as many may remember, stood at Gorbachev's side during an
improptu stop the Soviet leader made at a Washington street corner.
   The Moscow summit may present for Bush another in the series of
Catch-22-type problems that have followed his quest for the White
House. The thinking is that if something goes wrong in Moscow, Bush
will be held as accountable as Reagan. But if there is some
surprising positive development, the American people will give
Reagan credit.
   ``The truth is, he probably should gain something from the
summit and he probably won't,'' said Larry Sabato, a presidential
scholar at the University of Virginia.
   ``I just don't think it's going to make any difference for him
because he's not going there,'' Sabato said. ``Besides, he seems to
be having all the good things (in the Reagan record) roll off, and
all the bad things stick, these days.''
   But Bush's campaign aides hope the vice presient gets some
advantage from the Reagan-Gorbachev summit.
   Communications director Peter Teeley said that ``whatever you
get out of the thing is going to depend on the accomplishments, the
mood and the tone.''
   Sabato, Teeley and others said Bush will almost surely benefit,
to a certain degree, if the summit proceeds without incident or
problems. They said that he would be credited with being a part of
an administration that is advancing the prospects of peace and
easing tensions with the Soviets.
   ``Much of the American public believes that relations between
these two countries are getting better, so the (Bush) experience
factor is important,'' Teeley said.
   Bush, in fact, met with Gorbachev before Gorbachev ascended to
the top Kremlin position, and the vice president attended the
funerals of fallen Kremlin leaders Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov
and Konstantin Chernenko.
   On the campaign trail, he's fond of telling how he observed
Brezhnev's wife doing the sign of the cross as she hovered over his
dead body.
   During the December summit, Bush made a big play over his
one-on-one meeting with Gorbachev at the Soviet Embassy. Pictures
were taken as the pair sat smiling on a sofa, and the Bush campaign
depicted the vice president as a person who would provide
continuity in U.S. dealings with the Soviets.
   Stephen Wayne, a presidential scholar at George Washington
University, said the chief advantage the summit presents to Bush is
that ``it basically takes a critical issue from the Democrats _ the
fear of war with the Soviet Union. It takes a scary world and makes
it less scary.''
   But Wayne said Bush would gain a much greater advantage if he
were to attend the summit, and said modern communications and other
precautions could remove the obstacles to both the president and
vice president being together on foreign soil.
   But he said ``I don't see the people around the president being
willing to share the glory'' with Bush if there is some stunning
accomplishment there.
   ``We know that the vice president is in the worst of all
possible situations,'' Wayne said., ``He cannot take credit for the
administration's successes and he has to share the blame for its
failures.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a former aide when Bush was U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, claimed it was Bush who talked
the West German government into accepting Pershing II missiles,
even though there was a burgeoning anti-nuclear movement in that
country and Chancellor Helmut Kohl was under tremendous political
pressure.
   U.S. officials have said they believe the Soviets would never
have come to the table to negotiate an intermediate-range missile
treaty had it not been for the willingness of West Germany and
other North Atlantic allies to have U.S. missiles placed on their
soil.
   Leach said that because ``the personal dimensions of summits are
almost always presidential,'' it would be difficult for Bush to get
close enough to center stage to get a big political bounce at home.
   Sabato said, ``If politics were fair, I think he ought to get
some credit, just because the summit is happening. But he won't.''

<TEXT>
   Fourteen years after he was sentenced to die
for the slaying of a policeman, Willie X. Ross' murder conviction
was overturned.
   U.S. District Judge Dudley H. Bowen acted on the basis of an
argument frequently posed by Ross' attorneys over the years _ that
blacks were improperly excluded from the grand jury and his trial
jury.
   Ross was convicted by a Colquitt County jury of 12 white men for
the slaying of a white officer, Moultrie Lt. Tommie Meredith.
   The evidence, Bowen ruled Tuesday, does not support the
contention that the lack of blacks and women was due to ``neutral
selection criteria and procedures.''
   Bowen directed officials to release Ross, now 48, from custody
if he is not re-indicted and re-convicted, with constitutionally
selected juries, within one year.
   Southern Judicial Circuit District Attorney Lamar Cole was out
of town, his staff said, and could not be reached for comment.
Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers said he had not received
the ruling and could not comment.
   Ross, a native of Jacksonville, Fla., was one of the first three
men scheduled for execution after Georgia's new capital punishment
law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976. The execution was
delayed by appeals.
   Meredith was shot during a robbery-kidnapping attempt. Ross also
was convicted of kidnapping and robbery in the case.

<HEAD>U.S. To Urge Soviets To Seek Cuban Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA </BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superpower summit in Moscow next week is
expected to include a U.S. appeal to Soviet leaders to promote a
peaceful settlement in southern Africa by encouraging the
withdrawal of Cuban forces in Angola.
   Following an unsually intense period of diplomatic exchanges,
U.S. officials say they see the southern Africa issue as the Third
World conflict that offers the best hope for a settlement.
   It is not clear how much personal attention President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will pay to the issue but other
officials said that, at a mimimum, it will be discussed at lower
levels.
   Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost said last week that
the United States has been seeking from the Soviets use of their
influence with Angola and Cuba ``to encourage a realistic and
prompt timetable'' for the withdrawal of Cuban forces.
   According to U.S. estimates, Cuba has increased by at least
6,000 its troop strength in Angola to between 43,000 and 45,000
over the past several months. It also has deployed its forces to
within a few miles of the border with South African-controlled
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, for the first time.
   Aside from the Cuban troop issue, the administration also has
been asking the Soviets to promote a process of national
reconciliation between the Marxist government in Angola and the
U.S.-backed rebel group, UNITA. The two sides have been at war for
almost 13 years.
   South Africa sent up to 3,000 troops into Angola last year in
support of UNITA although Angolan estimates of Pretoria's
involvement have been much higher.
   With Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker playing the
key role, the administration has for years been attempting to
promote the withdrawal of all foreign forces from southern Africa _
Cubans from Angola and South Africans from Namibia and Angola.
   As the U.S. sees it, this would free the area of both superpower
competition and colonialism, enabling the region to concentrate on
development after years of warfare. Namibia is Africa's last colony.
   The administration has been calling for parallel movement on
both the Angolan and Namibian issues. The stumbling block thus far
is that while the South Africans have agreed to turn Namibia over
to an independent government under a one-year timetable outlined in
a U.N. Security Council resolution, Angola has proposed a Cuban
departure from Angola over a four-year time frame.
   The United States believes the Angolan timetable is excessive.
With U.S. support, South Africa has said it will not relinquish
control over Namibia unless there is an early timetable for a full
Cuban withdrawal from Angola.
   As described by U.S. officials, the principal Soviet advantage
in encouraging a peaceful settlement is that the Kremlin would be
spared continued large-scale losses of military equipment.
   The South African military has said that during a 1987 Angolan
offensive against UNITA and South African forces, Soviet-made
equipment losses included eight MiG 23s, four MiG 21s, eight
helicopters and 94 tanks, among other items.
   But the Cuban military has said that in recent fighting, a South
African escalation was given a ``firm, decisive and crushing
response.'' Cuba has defended its presence in Angola as an effort
to protect that country against ``racist aggression'' by South
Africa.
   Lately, the pace of diplomacy has increased. Earlier this month,
officials from the United States, South Africa, Angola and Cuba met
in London to explore the possibilities for a settlement. The
parties expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the
unprecedented encounter and agreed to meet again.

   Senior Kremlin advisers urged superpower leaders
Thursday to bury remaining Cold War differences and praised
President Reagan's comment that he heads to Moscow on a mission of
peace.
   The task at next week's summit is to bury ``this corpse of the
Cold War, which with the help of artificial means ... has been
maintained in a semi-living state,'' said U.S. affairs expert
Georgy A. Arbatov, one of several foreign affairs advisers who
predicted improved U.S.-Soviet relations in a meeting with
reporters.
   The state-run press also painted a rosy picture of superpower
ties. The labor newspaper Trud invoked U.S. public opinion in
pressing for a successful summit, claiming most Americans want
better relations with the Soviets. And Socialist Industry declared
that the two nations have entered a ``political thaw.''
   Reagan arrives Sunday for five days of meetings with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. It will be the fourth summit between the two leaders.
   ``Previously, our goals were more limited,'' said Arbatov,
observing that Reagan and Gorbachev in the past focused on easing
tensions built up since World War II.
   ``Now we have the possibility to move toward demilitarization of
Soviet-American relations,'' he said.
   Asked about Reagan's comment Wednesday that he viewed his
journey to the Soviet capital as a mission of peace, Arbatov smiled
and replied: ``I think there is something symbolic in this, that
Reagan is now coming with an olive branch to Moscow.''
   He said his view of Reagan had changed from that of a Cold
Warrior to a statesman. But Arbatov said Reagan had brought about
the improvement by coming around to the Soviet way of thinking on
disarmament and international relations.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, military chief of staff and first
deputy defense minister, joined in the spirit of ``new thinking,''
as the Kremlin refers to the force behind its foreign policy shifts
over the three years since Gorbachev came to power.
   Akhromeyev declared himself a ``completely different person'' as
a result of Gorbachev's reforms and said many other officials are
experiencing the same feeling.
   But he clung to standard Kremlin positions alleging that there
is no Soviet superiority in conventional weapons in Europe or
excessive spending on arms. But asked for details on Soviet defense
spending, Akhromeyev made the rare acknowledgement that the
reported defense budget does not reflect spending on research,
development and production of weapons.
   Akhromeyev declined to say how much of the Soviet Union's gross
national product is invested in defense, claiming he was privy only
to the budget approved by the Supreme Soviet, which amounts to
about 5 percent of government spending. That would put it at about
$33.9 billion.
   Western estimates have put Soviet defense spending as high as 19
percent of the gross national product, which measures the value of
all goods and services produced in a nation.
   Arbatov dismissed foreign assessments as ``speculation'' but
said Soviet spending on the military is proportionally higher than
in the United States because the Soviet gross national product is
lower, while the demands of security are equal.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky told reporters
that the talks would help in ``overcoming the heritage of the Cold
War.''
   All of the advisers contended that the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings
could produce important advances in negotiations toward a treaty
that would halve U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Murder Conviction Over Exclusion of Blacks From
Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has thrown out the 1974
murder conviction of a black death-row inmate in the slaying of a
white policeman, ruling that blacks and women were improperly
excluded from the jury.
   Willie X. Ross, now 48, was convicted by a Colquitt County jury
of 12 white men in the shooting death of Moultrie police Lt. Tommie
Meredith.
   U.S. District Judge Dudley H. Bowen, in a ruling made public
Wednesday, said blacks and women were intentionally excluded from
the pools used in selecting the grand jury that indicted him and
the trial jury that convicted him.
   The judge said there is no evidence that the lack of blacks and
women was due to ``neutral selection criteria and procedures.''
   Lamar Cole, district attorney in the state's Southern Judicial
Circuit, said he will seek to re-indict Ross.
   Ross, a native of Jacksonville, Fla., was scheduled for
execution after Georgia's new capital punishment law was upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976, but the condemned man's appeals
delayed the execution.
   Ross' younger brother, Theodore Ross, testified at his trial
that Ross was the trigger man in the slaying. Theodore Ross served
a prison term for kidnapping and robbery and was released in 1987.
   Two other men convicted in the slaying, Freddie Lee King and
Rudolph Alonzo Turner, are serving life sentences.

   A man shot a woman he apparently
mistook for his wife, offered to take her to a hospital, then
killed himself with a shot to the head, authorities said.
   ``We're going on the assumption that it was a case of mistaken
identity,'' Marshall County sheriff's Capt. Randy Amos said after
the shootings Wednesday.
   Officials said Ernest Michael Bowman, 32, shot Marsha Lynn
Atchley, 26, at Lake Guntersville. She was in fair condition
Thursday at Carraway Methodist Medical Center.
   ``I think he realized just what a mistake he had made, and he
couldn't handle that,'' police Lt. Carl Fulmer said.
   Ms. Atchley, of Arab, told witnesses she had never before seen
the man who shot her once in the chest with a .32-caliber pistol.
   Witnesses said the woman was in a bathing suit and lying on a
chaise lounge at a lake when Bowman drove up, walked over to her
and knelt beside her.
   ``One witness said he heard the woman scream and then heard a
gunshot,'' Amos said. ``She begged Bowman not to shoot her again,
and he told her it was all a mistake and then asked her if he could
take her to the hospital.''
   Ms. Atchley refused and walked to her car and got in, Amos said,
while Bowman walked back to his truck.
   Fulmer said Bowman traveled about one-third of a mile, then
``pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head while the truck was
moving.'' He said the truck traveled about 300 more yards before
stopping in a ditch.
   Bowman apparently was upset that a warrant charging him with
parole violation was issued Wednesday. If convicted, he would have
faced serving the remaining three years of a 10-year sentence for
the Aug. 23, 1980, robbery of a package store.
   He was paroled about a year ago and had fulfilled all the
requirements of his parole until this month, parole Officer Bobby
Roberts said. On May 3, Roberts said, he was arrested and charged
with public intoxication, assault and harassment of his wife.
   He was found guilty on May 9. Roberts said that was sufficient
cause to revoke his parole and issue a warrant for his arrest.

   Senate negotiators worked today to clear away
the remaining obstacles to a U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
medium-range nuclear missiles and headed toward almost certain
approval of the first arms-control treaty to be ratified in 16
years.
   Meetings on the remaining issues resumed today between the
Senate's leaders and senior members of the Foreign Relations, Armed
Services and Intelligence committees.
   ``I'm very optimistic about finishing this matter,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who noted that the areas of
disagreement had been whittled down to two or three. ``I'm
confident that everybody is going in the same direction,'' he said.
   The Senate, on a vote of 96-0, today approved an amendment
incorporating into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago in
Geneva by Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, dealing with warheads using
``futuristic'' technology and clarifying on-site verification rules.
   Leaders had conferred late into Wednesday night in an effort to
settle what appeared to be the thorniest dispute, one between the
administration and the Senate over possible future reinterpretation
of the treaty.
   ``We're not there yet, but we've made a good deal of progress,''
said Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   A key to progress on the treaty was the decision on Wednesday by
the leading opponent of the pact, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to drop
his delaying tactics. Helms said he did so in the face of a
probable vote by the Senate to shut off debate.
   ``That was the end of it,'' Helms conceded in a floor speech.
``I've had no illusions about defeating this treaty. The American
people are beginning to understand that this is a dangerous
treaty.''
   Helms' concession ended more than a week of delay and raised
hopes that the accord could be approved in time to be shipped to
Moscow so that President Reagan could formally exchange
ratification documents with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
the summit meeting that begins Sunday.
   The primary remaining issue did not affect the treaty itself,
but the modified conditions under which the Senate would grant its
consent.
   Democrats sought to attach a condition stipulating that any
attempt by a future president to reinterpret the treaty would have
to be approved by the Senate in order to become effective.
   Backers of the change have said it is an attempt to preserve the
Senate's constitutional power of advise and consent on treaties.
The debate stems from a dispute with the Reagan administration over
its attempt to reinterpret the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to
permit more latitude in developing Reagan's Star Wars missile
defense.
   That treaty with the Soviet Union was the last arms-control pact
to win Senate approval.
   The treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces, which Reagan
and Gorbachev signed in Washington on Dec. 8, requires elimination
within three years of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles with a range
of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. It would result in the elimination of
867 U.S. missiles in Europe and elimination of 1,752 Soviet
missiles.
   While the treaty is regarded as militarily insignificant because
it leaves most of both sides' nuclear arsenals intact, it holds
potentially great political significance as a model for a follow-up
treaty to provide for deep cuts in long-range nuclear missiles.
   As leaders wrangled throughout the day Wednesday in an effort to
clear remaining procedural hurdles, the Senate approved a pair of
relatively mild amendments to the accord and overwhelmingly
defeated two others.
   On a voice vote, the lawmakers approved a non-binding provision
urging negotiators in future talks on reductions in long-range
missile arsenals not to give up the U.S. right to maintain stocks
of conventionally armed air- and sea-launched cruise missiles.
   And the Senate urged the president to keep human rights in the
forefront of U.S.-Soviet relations and ``insist on sustained and
demonstrable human rights progress.'' That language was added on a
voice vote.
   Helms was rebuffed in an attempt to add a provision stipulating
that if either side provided ``materially misleading or false
data,'' the other side would be free to withdraw from the treaty.
The amendment failed on a vote of 89-9.
   And Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., failed on a 69-28 vote to win
an exemption from the ban for conventionally armed cruise missiles.
Hollings argued that keeping such missiles in the allied arsenal
would help offset Warsaw Pact superiority in conventional forces,
but opponents pointed out it would be impossible to verify that the
missiles were not nuclear-tipped.

   Seismic technology is sensitive enough to
confidently monitor all but the smallest Soviet underground nuclear
tests, a congressional scientific study said Thursday.
   The conclusions could help to reach a ban on all underground
testing, one of the unresolved issues between the two superpowers,
said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   Fascell called the study ``an important contribution'' to the
effort to develop a test ban.
   The study, carried out by the Office of Technology Assessment,
an arm of Congress, was released as President Reagan rested in
Helsinki, Finland, while en route to the Soviet Union.
   Reagan will travel to Moscow this weekend for his fourth summit
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and one of the issues on
the agenda is underground nuclear testing.
   The two leaders are expected to sign a pair of protocols
designed to improve monitoring procedures.
   Open-air tests are banned by a 1963 treaty, while two separate
treaties, signed in 1974 and 1976, limit underground tests to 150
kilotons. Both sides claim to adhere to the 1970s accords, although
neither treaty has been formally ratified by the U.S. Senate.
   Reagan has promised to submit the pacts to the Senate if
adequate verification procedures can be worked out. The two
protocols will set the ground rules for joint experiments this
summer in Nevada and Semipalatinsk to measure the force of
detonations.
   The Soviets want to use seismic monitoring systems, similar to
the kind used to watch for earthquakes. The United States prefers a
system known as CORRTEX, which involves inserting a cable in a
shaft about 30 feet from the test hole and taking measuresment from
it.
   The OTA study said ``seismology now provides a means to monitor
underground nuclear explosions down to low yields, even when
strenuous attempts are made to evade the monitoring systems. By
doing so, seismology plays a central role in verifying arms control
agreements that limit the testing of nuclear weapons.''
   Seismic monitoring systems, even if none of the stations are in
the Soviet Union, can readily monitor tests down to the 10-kiloton
level ``with high confidence,'' the study said.
   In fact, ``expert opinion about the lowest yields that could
reliably be monitored ranges from 1 kiloton to 10 kilotons,'' the
study said.
   One kiloton has the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT. The
U.S. atomic bomb dropped Aug. 6, 1945 on Hiroshima, Japan, had an
explosive force of about 20 kilotons.
   Once a seismic signal is detected by the underground monitoring
stations, OTA said, its source could be reliably tracked down.
   ``Over 90 percent of all seismic events in the U.S.S.R can be
classified as earthquakes simply becuase they are either toop dee
or not in a plausible location for a nuclear explosion,'' the study
said. ``The combination of all methods, when applied in a
comprehensive approach, can differentiate between with explosions,
down to low yields, and earthquakes.''
   The report also looked at a comprehensive test ban, saying it
``could be considered adequately verifiable if it were determined
that the advantage of such a treaty would outweigh the significance
of any undetected clandestine testing belo the monitoring
threshold.''
   A total test ban has long been a goal of U.S. arms control
advocates and the Soviets have recently backed such a restriction.
For 18 months ending in February 1987 the Soviets unilaterally
suspended all testing, but the Reagan administration declined to
join the moratorium.
   In each of the past two years, the House has voted to ban atomic
tests above the one-kilton level, but the Senate rejected such a
ban and the White House has strongly opposed the limitation.
   OTA suggested that a phased approach could be adopted setting
the first step at 10 kilotons.
   ``This is a level that can currently be well monitored
seismically,'' the study said.

   Rebel and Sandinista government
leaders started a new round of talks today aimed at ending their
6{-year war, and the rebels said they were proposing a peace plan
focusing on democratic reforms.
   The rebels, who have been supported by the U.S. government, said
they would lay down their arms and rejoin the political life of the
country if the Sandinistas guarantee democratization.
   At the center of the proposal is the demand that the Sandinistas
ease their control over the army and government. The rebels, also
known as Contras, also ask for constitional reforms, freedom of
expression and freedom of the press.
   ``We are not optimistic,'' however, said Alfredo Cesar, leader
of the Nicaraguan Resistance rebel delegation.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the nation's defense minister, led the
government delegation to the third round of top-level peace talks
held in Managua.
   Tight security was in effect at the Camino Real Hotel, where the
negotiators met. The witnesses are Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo and Joao Baena Soares, secretary general of the
Organization of American States.
   The rebel plan sets a flexible timetable that eventually would
have Contra fighters lay down their arms before Christmas.
   The government said it was ready to offer political reforms to
guarantee clean elections. It offered to give congressional
representation to parties not in the National Assembly, to set a
timetable for municipal and other elections, and to change the
makeup of the electoral council to assure ``pluralistic
representation.''
   Cesar told reporters late Wednesday, ``We have come here to
present a comprehensive proposal to the government for a global
solution to the war.''
   The rebels, he said, were prepared to make a ``special effort to
achieve a definitive cease-fire.''
   But he said he was not optimistic because the government has not
complied with a preliminary peace plan worked out March 23 in
Sapoa, a small village on the Costa Rican border.
   The rebel delegation arrived Wednesday evening, ending a dispute
over where the talks would be held.
   The rebels had refused to return to Managua, the site of two
previous sessions. They complained the government restricted their
access to opposition political leaders.
   The government insisted the talks be held in the capital and
agreed to let the rebels meet with the opposition Nicaraguan
Democratic Coordinate and visit the Roman Catholic bishops'
conference, the opposition newspaper La Prensa and relatives.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, the rebel military leader, arrived from
Tegucigalpa, Honduras, to take part in the negotiations, marking
his first trip to Managua since the war started in late 1981.
   ``My presence here is due to the fact that I'm a Nicaraguan and
that I'm opposed to the state of affairs in Nicaragua,'' he told a
news conference.
   ``I have come here to try to see Sapoa fulfilled, to discuss a
cease-fire and an end to the war because this is my country,'' he
said.
   In Washington, Wilson Morris, an aide to House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, said on Tuesday the rebels planned to offer to
disarm themselves by Sept. 1.
   The two sides earlier agreed to a 60-day cease-fire to give them
time to arrange a permanent truce. The cease-fire was to expire on
May 30, but President Daniel Ortega announced earlier in the week
that he would extend it for an additional 30 days.
   Cesar told reporters the rebels do not want repeated extensions
of the cease-fire, but rather a permanent halt to the fighting.
   If the cease-fire ends on May 30, he said, the rebels will take
up ``defensive positions'' but will not break the truce.
   Ortega says the war has killed 26,500 people and caused $3
billion in damage to the economy.
   A major obstacle to agreement has been the question of how
non-lethal aid will be delivered to rebels gathered in cease-fire
zones inside Nicaragua.
   Under the Sapoa agreement, the aid was to come through a neutral
international organization. Contras insisted in the talks that they
had the right to choose the organization.
   Contra leaders were quoted as saying they would accept a
proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside
Nicaragua by an agency with ties to the Organization of American
States.

   A small, Southern Baptist college has won a
reprieve from liquidation, but will have to come up with a plan by
June 3 to repay its $20 million debt, a federal judge has ordered.
   Bankruptcy Judge Robert McGuire acted in response to a motion
from Bishop College's attorneys to quash his March order that would
have changed the college's status from Chapter 11 reorganization to
Chapter 7 liquidation as of Wednesday. That would have closed the
107-year-old, predominantly black school.
   McGuire said Wednesday he would set a hearing on the
reorganization plan for creditors for the week of June 27, with a
confirmation hearing the week of July 25.
   The plan would take effect Aug. 15 and school officials promised
they would raise enough money to pay for the entire 1988-89 school
year. Officials said without that money in hand, Bishop would not
open in the fall.
   ``In order for the community to regain confidence, we need to
show we are fiscally responsible,'' said Trip Finley, a Bishop
attorney. ``But we not only have to convince our creditors, but
also the Southern Baptist Association.'' He said Bishop will be
re-evaluated by the association this fall for its accreditation.
   In March, McGuire ruled the 300-student college could remain
open on the condition officials raised at least $50,000 every two
weeks. The ruling further stipulated that without a substantial
change in the college's finances, Bishop would be ordered to
liquidate its assets to repay $20 million owed 400 creditors.
   School officials say Bishop has raised more than $617,000 in two
months and has pledges for $158,000 more.
   Finley said it will take seven to 10 years to repay all the
school's debts.
   The college has failed to meet Chapter 11 obligations to keep
all bills current, said George McElreath, the U.S trustee
overseeing the case. But he conceded the school had complied with
the $50,000 bi-monthly payments since March and officials seemed
willing to work out the remaining debt.
   Judith Swift, who represents the Faculty and Staff Committee,
said she was concerned that faculty members had not been paid about
$500,000 in back salary and wages.
   But Finley said a $125,000 payment to the salaries was made
Wednesday and that school officials hoped to pay $122,000 more _
the usual payroll _ from the next funds received.

   An FEB agent told a congressional hearing
today the government did not entrap U.S. District Judge Alcee L.
Hastings when it was investigating allegations of bribery involving
him and a Washington lawyer.
   William J. Murphy Jr., who headed the FBI's investigation in the
case, said the federal government attempted to determine the truth
of the allegations made by an informant who said Washington lawyer
William A. Borders had bragged that he could bribe several judges,
including Hastings.
   ``We were only trying to prove or disprove what (the informant)
said,'' Murphy told a House judiciary subcommittee holding
impeachment hearings on Hastings.
   Rep. Patrick L. Swindall, R-Ga., said the FBI had no evidence
against Hastings, only the informant's statement about Borders.
``Isn't this a classic textbook entrapment?'' he asked.
   Borders was arrested after an undercover agent allegedly gave
him $120,000 in $100 bills in Washington to bribe Hastings into
giving a lenient sentence to two men on trial before him in Miami.
   ``Would there have been a crime had the federal government not
given Borders the money?'' Swindall asked.
   Murphy said Borders approached the informant ``and he laid out
to (him) what he would be able to do.''
   Murphy said the undercover meeting with Borders, when the money
was exchanged, ``was a tool to respond to (the informant's)
allegations. If Borders didn't show up at the meeting and didn't
say the things he did, the case would have stopped.
   ``The information we were trying to prove or disprove was that
Borders and Judge Hastings were going to do a crime,'' he said.
``We didn't decide one day in the office to get Judge Hastings.''
   Borders refused to testify Wednesday at a House Judiciary
subcommittee's televised impeachment proceedings against Hastings,
citing his Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination.
   After serving 33 months of a five-year sentence in federal
prison, paying a $35,000 fine and being disbarred by the District
of Columbia Court of Appeals, Borders said, ``I believe that my
legal debt to society expired on May 22, 1988, after my release
from parole.''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the chairman of the inquiry,
said the subcommittee will decide later whether to grant Borders
immunity from prosecution and compel his testimony.
   Hastings was acquitted five years ago of conspiring with Borders
to solicit a bribe from two convicted racketeers, Frank and Tom
Romano, in exchange for the promise of a lenient sentence.
   But a special five-judge investigative panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in September 1986 there was
``clear and convincing evidence'' that Hastings committed the crime
and tried to conceal his role by lying under oath and manufacturing
evidence at his trial.
   Hastings insists that he knew nothing of the bribery plot and
accuses Borders of using his name in an attempt to shake down the
Romano brothers.
   Hastings was allowed Wednesday to cross-examine the two fellow
judges who filed misconduct charges against him six weeks after his
acquittal.
   One of them, U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges of
Tampa, Fla., said it was a ``gut-wrenching decision'' to file the
complaint, and U.S. District Judge Anthony A. Alaimo of Brunswick,
Ga., said Hodges was ``on the verge of tears.''
   Retorted Hastings: ``I've cried a lot, Tony.''
   Hastings, who is Florida's first black federal judge, has
charged repeatedly that his prosecution was racially and
politically motivated. But Hodges told the subcommittee that
Hastings' race had ``absolutely not'' any bearing on his decision
to file a complaint.
   Conyers, laying the groundwork for Murphy's testimony, said it
was ``amazing'' that FBI agents arrested Borders and seized
$125,000 in bribe money before Borders had a chance to pass it
along to anyone else.
   Hastings was staying at a hotel a couple of miles away when
Borders was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, inside a car with the payoff
money supplied by an FBI undercover agent posing as Frank Romano.
   The judicial panel said that when Hastings learned of Borders'
arrest, he hurriedly flew back to Miami from a Baltimore airport
because he wanted to avoid questioning by FBI agents.
   John Doar, chief counsel to the judicial panel, said there was
sufficient circumstantial evidence to implicate Hastings in a
conspiracy. But he agreed with Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., that the
case against Hastings would have been ``almost impregnable'' if he
had actually received bribe money from Borders.
   A few hours after Borders' arrest, Hastings was to have appeared
at a boating party given by lawyer friends in Borders' honor.

   A potent cancer-fighting can safely relieve
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in patients unresponsive to other
medication, a doctor reported today.
   The drug, Methotrexate, has been used to treat arthritis in the
past, but daily use is thought to cause cirhosis of the liver.
   Dr. James E. Brick, assistant professor of medicine at West
Virginia University School of Medicine, said in a report at a
meeting of the American Rheumatism Association that weekly doses of
the drug were found to be safe in a 1980-87 study of 96 patients.
   Mild and moderate amounts of fat and inflammation were found to
be common in the livers of patients with rheumatoid arthritis even
before they were treated with Methotrexate, Brick said.
   ``After treatment, these abnormalities increased in some
patients but seemed to decrease in others,'' Brick said. ``None of
the patients developed cirrhosis as a result of Methotrexate
therapy.''
   ``We believe our data indicates that Methotrexate can be safely
given, from an hepatic standpoint, to selected patients with
rheumatoid arthritis for a period of several years,'' he said.
   Treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis ordinarily
involves a combination of medication, physical therapy, education
and surgery.
   Patients that are unresponsive or intolerant to the simplest
drugs progressively receive more potent medications such as
Methotrexate.

   The Soviet Union today abruptly
canceled one of President Reagan's meetings with General Secretary
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and questioned the composition of a religious
group scheduled to meet with Reagan in Moscow.
   But a White House spokesman said the session at the Danilov
monastery was ``going to proceed as scheduled.'' The spokesman,
Roman Popadiuk, said the decision to scrub one of Reagan's meetings
with Gorbachev was ``mutual.''
   However, on the president's flight Wednesday from Washington,
chief spokesman Marlin Fitzwater put the cancellation differently.
He said the Soviets had suggested dropping a meeting and the U.S.
side was trying to clarify the reason.
   Despite the White House's efforts to smooth over any
differences, the schedule change and rumors that the Soviets were
attempting to restrict access to Reagan contributed a measure of
uncertainty to his fourth summit meeting with the general secretary.
   Reagan, meanwhile, passed the day relaxing and keeping his
distance from the hundreds of reporters following in his footsteps.
   A brief press notice said Reagan and his wife Nancy strolled
along a lake near their guest house. During the 30-minute walk the
president skipped stones along the water, the press release said.
   The session, called off because of what the Soviets cited as
``some internal function,'' was one of five that Reagan had
scheduled over four days with his Gorbachev.
   Overall, the president still will spend six hours with the
Soviet leader because the remaining sessions will be expanded, said
Fitzwater.
   ``I regard it as routine,'' Fitzwater said, as Reagan spent the
day in seclusion at a government guesthouse making preparations for
his talks in Moscow.
   The summit encountered another glitch when word reached the
presidential party taking a rest stop in Finland that the Soviets
had questioned the participation of one of the religious groups due
to meet with Reagan at a monestary on Monday.
   ``The meeting itself is still on as far as I know,'' Fitzwater
said. He said he did not know which religious group might be
excluded.
   Reagan also plans to meet separately with a group of Jewish
``refuseniks'' who had been unable to obtain exit permits for
Israel. Fitzwater said he was unable to verify a report that two of
them had been intercepted by Soviet authorities on their way to
Moscow from Leningrad.
   On the official level, the Soviets have shown no concern over
the meeting planned between Reagan and Soviet refuseniks. At a
press conference to discuss the forthcoming summit, U.S. affairs
expert Georgy A. Arbatov and Communist Party Central Committee
official Nikolai Shishlin both stated that they considered Reagan's
meeting partners his own business.
   Reagan's first visit to the country he once denounced as ``the
evil empire'' was already clouded by failure of a U.S. effort to
oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the military ruler of Panama.
   After the summit, Gorbachev will preside at the first
full-fledged Communist Party conference since 1941, but there was
no immediate word on whether the cancellation of the second of
Reagan-Gorbachev sessions on Monday had any connection with the
party meetings.
   For the Soviets, the party conference has tended to overshadow
Reagan's fourth summit meeting with Gorbachev, since it will serve
as a test of the Soviet leader's economic reform policies and his
three years at the Kremlin helm.
   At the same time, the summit itself has lost any expectation of
major results with the failure of U.S. and Soviet negotiators to
complete a treaty to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
Reagan and Gorbachev had hoped to make such an accord the
centerpiece of the 77-year-old president's first trip to Moscow.
   In an interview Tuesday with a group of West European
jouralists, Reagan left open the possibility of a fifth summit with
Gorbachev before he leaves office in January _ if negotiators can
complete the treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons.
   ``I won't rule it out,'' Reagan said in a text released here
today. ``I won't say it's impossible ... I would hope that we can
iron out the still undecided points before I leave..''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz joined Reagan on his summit
trip early today, carrying a full report on the collapse of
negotiations to remove Noriega from power.
   Shultz was greeted briefly and without ceremony by Finnish
Foreign Minister Kalevi Sorsa before climbing into a black
limousine for the 15-minute ride to the guest house where Reagan
was staying.
   ``I don't feel weakened,'' Reagan had assured reporters after
his post-midnight landing. But he seemed disappointed _ and at a
loss on what he might try next to force out Noriega.
   Shultz had stayed behind to supervise the negotiations held in
Panama between Michael G. Kozak of the State Department and Noriega.
   Apparently, the general's aides had given the impression the
deal would go through, but Noriega turned Kozak down and the
emissary was ordered home.
   ``It seemed for a time as if he had some plan ...,'' Reagan said
of Noriega, his voice trailing off, ``but evidently he changed his
mind about this.''
   Asked what he might do next, Reagan said, ``That's going to take
some studying and consultation.''
   Evidently, any serious planning will have to take a back seat to
the Moscow summit and Reagan's first visit to the Soviet Union,
beginning on Sunday.
   In any event, Fitzwater said: ``No other negotiations are
planned. No agreement has been left on the table.''
   Fitzwater said U.S. economic sanctions against Panama would
remain in place.
   Earlier, Fitzwater seemed to expect a positive outcome in the
negotiations. ```We can hear something at any time,'' he told
reporters aboard Air Force One.
   Under the proposed deal, Noriega would have left Panama this
summer and not returned until after elections were held in May 1989.
   The president also was hoping for word from Capitol Hill that
the Senate had ratified his treaty to abolish U.S. and Soviet
nuclear missiles in the range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Another key aide, Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of
staff, stayed behind to oversee maneuvering by Senate Democratic
and Republican leaders to choke off debate and bring Reagan's only
nuclear arms control agreement to a vote before the president opens
talks with General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Sunday.
   If the administration's strategy is successful, Baker will fly
the ratified pact to Moscow on Saturday so Reagan and Gorbachev can
have a formal exchange of the documents.
   The Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, endorsed the treaty
on Monday and sent it to the Presidium, the highest executive body,
for ratification. Viktor P. Karpov, head of the foreign ministry's
arms control office, said the Soviets should not ratify the treaty
before the United States.
   In a pre-departure interview with a group of foreign reporters,
Reagan said he still believed a treaty to cut strategic nuclear
weapons could be completed during the eight months that remain in
his term.
   But, he said, that would require ``hard work and constructive
negotiating by both sides.''
   He said his overarching goal was ``to bequeath to my successor
next January the firm basis for a stable, sustainable relationship
with the Soviet Union.''

<HEAD>Jewish Seminary Student Stabbed in Jerusalem's Old City</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Plea cq as first name of Mrs. Albeck</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old Jewish seminary student walking
through Jerusalem's walled old city Thursday was stabbed in the
back by an Arab, police said. Authorities said they rounded up 27
suspects.
   The victim's mother said her son told her the assailant shouted
``Allahu Akhbar!'' (God is Great) as he plunged in the knife.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a Palestinian
rebellion began Dec. 8, the army lifted curfews on eight villages
and refugee camps. Curfews remained in effect on Idna village and
the Dheishe refugee camp in the West Bank.
   Chanoch Albeck was wearing a black skullcap and was in the old
city's Moslem sector when the attack occurred. Two other students
helped him to the nearby Jewish quarter, where he was given first
aid and taken to a hospital with the knife still in his back.
   Justice Ministry officials said his mother, Plea Albeck, is a
government lawyer who has handled cases of land confiscation in the
occupied territories, but they said they believed it was a random
attack.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem issued a statement saying he was
``shocked and disgusted.''
   ``The Arab public in Jerusalem must understand that such actions
in the end will only hurt Arabs,'' Kollek said.
   Arab attacks on Jewish civilians have been rare in Jerusalem,
where Jews and Arabs often live side by side,
   Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war,
along with the West Bank, and has formally annexed it. Gaza was
taken from Egypt in 1967.
   At least 195 Palestinians have been killed in the Arab rebellion
in the occupied territories. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish
settler also have been slain.
   According to figures compiled by Law in the Service of Man, a
human rights group founded by Palestinian lawyers, 17,000 Arabs
have been detained since Dec. 8., and 7,300 remain in jail, 1,800
of them without being tried or charged. Most are said to be men
aged 15 to 35.
   The organization, an affiliate of the Geneva-based International
Commission of Jurists, said Israeli soldiers had blown up 36 houses
of Arabs suspected of security offenses.
   Rafi Levy, spokesman for the Jerusalem police, said Albeck was
attacked from behind by a single Arab. He said the student was
walking along a narrow lane in the Moslem Quarter, apparently on
his way to a seminary in the adjacent Jewish quarter.
   Dr. Oded Zamir of Hadassah Hospital said the knife passed very
near the heart but Albeck was was in stable condition. ``Only his
lung was injured,'' the doctor said on Israel radio.
   Mrs. Albeck said on the radio her son was conscious and feeling
``relatively good.''
   ``He said he heard somebody saying `Allahu Akbar' and then he
felt a push,'' she said. ``Afterwards he ... felt a knife sticking
in his back. He called for help and walked but nobody would help
him until he reached the Jewish area.''
   Alex Yosipo, a merchant in the Jewish quarter, told the radio:
``He said he was alone when it happened. ... There apparently was
no scuffle.''
   Mrs. Albeck said she hoped the stabbing would not increase
tensions in the old city.
   ``During the years we have all lived here and there was
progress,'' she said. ``With hope, with God's help, there will be
improvement in the future, more understanding.''

<HEAD>Senators Propose Radio-TV Ad Campaign to Combat Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee on
Thursday introduced a bill to provide $75 million annually for a
three-year radio and television advertising campaign aimed at
reducing demand for illegal drugs.
   The broadcasting industry branded some provisions of the
legislation unconstitutional.
   The media blitz would have the ``intensity of a presidential
advertising campaign,'' said Sen. John Danforth of Missouri,
ranking Republican on the panel, who introduced the bill with Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., committee chairman.
   ``When people turn on their TV in the evening, we want them to
see at least once during the evening a commercial that is very
hard-hitting about the drug issue,'' Danforth said at a news
conference.
   Under the measure, the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration in the Commerce Department would oversee
production of the ads and buy time to air them on commercial radio
and TV stations nationwide.
   The bill would authorize $75 million a year over three years for
the program. Broadcasters would be required to provide the
government reasonable access to all time periods to air the spots
and to charge their lowest rates.
   The National Association of Broadcasters said the bill is
unconstitutional because it mandates government access to broadcast
facilities.
   Broadcasters support anti-drug efforts and already contribute
more than $1 billion a year in air time and facilities to the
anti-drug campaign, said NAB President Edward O. Fritts.
   Hollings cited precedents for the federal government advertising
on radio and TV, including the armed forces' recruiting ads and
promotions for Amtrak. But the NAB said that in none of those cases
is a broadcast station required by law to accept an ad.
   Danforth said an anti-drug ad campaign should be at least as
successful as anti-smoking campaigns, which have had to compete
against counter-advertising by the tobacco industry and relied
mostly on public service announcements.
   Despite the obstacles, anti-smoking campaigns produced a 25
percent decline in cigarette smoking among Americans over the past
two decades, he said.

   An overturned propane tanker burned itself
out after two days this morning, enabling hundreds of families to
return home and promising some relief from the monumental traffic
jams caused by the accident.
   Fear of an explosion had prompted evacuation of about 500
families within a half-mile of the wreck and the closing of roads
and rail lines connecting New York City to its eastern suburbs.
   ``As of 6:28 a.m., the flames extinguished and the tank is
empty,'' Officer Richard Scibilia, a Nassau County police
spokesman, said today. ``People are being allowed to return to
their homes.''
   Rail service was restored by the end of the morning rush. County
Executive Thomas Gulotta said the highway would probably reopen in
the afternoon.
   Tens of thousands of commuters had been forced to use alternate
rail lines or other transportation after the truck carrying 2,500
gallons of propane burst into flames Tuesday morning on Long
Island's Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway.
   Water had been shot toward the flames from unmanned pumpers for
days. Emergency workers watched the slow burn through binoculars
from a quarter-mile away.
   Firefighters avoided trying to extinguish the blaze until the
gas was spent in order to avoid an explosion.
   Firefighters opened a vent on the tanker Wednesday to increase
the fire's consumption of the propane. Earlier, Fire Chief Raymond
Kuhner said that if the ``accelerated burn'' didn't work, the fire
could go on for eight days.
   At a news conference, Gulotta defended the precautions, saying,
``If this tank had exploded it would have devastated everything
within a 1,000-foot radius.''
   The Long Island Rail Road said 30,000 rail commuters were
directly affected by the closing of several stations. The truck
caught fire about 2,000 feet from the track.
   The closing of the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway and the Sunrise
Highway, used by about 70,000 vehicles a day, had forced motorists
to go out of their way to get to and from New York.
   James Pearce, a spokesman for a motorist information service on
Long Island, said trips that usually took 45 minutes were taking 3{
hours. ``I would say the western half of Nassau County is backed up
solidly,'' he said.
   ``This is the worst traffic I've seen here in 22 years on the
job,'' said Freeport Police Officer Roosevelt Hendricks.
   Most of the evacuees stayed with relatives or friends. About 300
stayed at the Seaford Middle School.
   ``I never thought I'd have to be here a second night. I thought
it would be all over with today,'' Judy Crinion said late
Wednesday. ``If there's a house left when we get home, we're going
to be very, very, very happy.''

<TEXT>
   Iranian gunboats today attacked a
Norwegian-operated oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and set it
ablaze.
   Persian Gulf-based shipping executives identified the stricken
tanker as the 15,530-ton liquefied petroleum gas carrier Mundogas
Rio and said it was fully laden and sailing out of the Hormuz when
attacked.
   It was the third attack by the Iranians on neutral shipping
since Washington broadened the duties of the U.S. Navy in the gulf,
allowing warships to intervene in attacks on commercial vessels,
even if they were sailing under flags other than the Stars and
Stripes.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
were not aware of any U.S. warships in the area at the time of the
attack.
   They said the captain of the vessel which flies the Liberian
flag reported a small fire aboard the vessel, but no casualties
among the crew.
   Two salvage tugboats in the vicinity rushed out to the help the
tanker, they said.
   The attacks are an offshoot of the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.

<HEAD>Separation Benefits for Railroaders Ruled Fully Taxable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Separation benefits paid 4,500 employees who
lost their jobs with the Conrail railroad are fully taxable, the
U.S. Tax Court ruled Thursday.
   The court held in a test case involving two of the laid-off
workers that the benefits are not unemployment compensation, which
would have exempted part of them from tax; have not been granted a
specific exemption by Congress and must be fully included in income
subject to tax.
   The benefits were authorized by Congress as part of a 1982 law
aimed at cutting the expenses of Conrail, which took over seven
bankrupt railroads in the Northeast and Midwest.
   The ruling came in the cases of John Roberts Martin of Girard,
Ohio, and Bernard J. Spanski of Hudson, Ohio, both of whom were
laid off by Conrail in 1982 and filed claims for subsistence
allowances.
   Spanski chose an option under which he gave up all seniority
rights in exchange for a lump-sum payment of $20,000. Martin
elected a second option, under which he retained his seniority, was
listed as furloughed and received a daily subsistence allowance,
reimbursement for moving expenses and other benefits, with the
package limited to $20,000.
   No money was withheld from either allowance and neither Martin
nor Spansky received a W-2 form at yearend listing income received
during the year. In May 1984, the two laid-off workers received a
notice from the Railroad Retirement Board announcing that the
Internal Revenue Service had ruled that such benefits, except for
health and welfare premiums, were fully taxable.
   After the IRS billed Martin and Spansky for back taxes on the
payments, they challenged the action in Tax Court. The parties
agreed that the outcome of their cases would determine those of
other laid-off Conrail employees.

<HEAD>Financial Woes Reduce PTL Workforce by 66 Percent in Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL laid off 162 employees, shut down its
dinner theater and religious music service and cut back on its TV
operations this week as time and money continued running out for
ministry built by Jim Bakker.
   The layoffs Wednesday were the second such mass dismissal in six
weeks. Financial problems have forced PTL to dismiss 66 percent of
its work force in the last year.
   Earlier this week, PTL's new trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, said
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court that PTL might have to go off the air and
cease all operations within weeks.
   From last June, when it filed for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy law, through the end of April, PTL had piled up $3.6
million in operating deficits. It already owed as much as $130
million in back debts.
   Contributions have dropped steadily and dramatically in the last
six weeks, since the IRS revoked PTL's tax-exempt status.
   Among the operations shut down Wednesday at PTL's Heritage USA
Christian theme park were, according to spokesman David West:
   _The Heritage Grand Hotel's dinner theater, which drew 77,000
patrons in 1986;
   _Park Road Productions, which produced advertisements and other
services for commercial television;
   _PTL Publishing Co., which produced religious music.
   ``This is a major blow,'' said singer Nancy Stainback. ``There's
only four singers left and a rhythm section. There were many tears
shed this afternoon. It was like another death.''
   The biggest cuts Wednesday came on the television side of the
ministry, an area that had not been cut seriously in previous
layoffs. About 50 of 100 employees lost their jobs, sources told
The Charlotte, N.C., Observer.
   ``Today hurt so bad I wasn't sure I could go on,'' said Ron
Aldridge, host of ``The PTL Show.''
   Heritage USA is for sale, although PTL hopes to salvage its
religious functions, including its TV broadcasting, by spinning
them off in a separate non-profit entity to be called Heritage
Ministries.
   The ministry built by Bakker before his downfall in a sex
scandal last year now has 509 full-time employees, compared to
1,480 a year ago.

   Faye Dunaway says her performance as an icy,
manipulative Joan Crawford in ``Mommie Dearest'' was too believable
for her own good, but her portrayal of an alcoholic in ``Barfly''
may have helped save her career.
   ``I was too good as Crawford,'' she said in an interview
published in the June 13 issue of US magazine. ``I think that
changed the notion of who I was. ... It created a kind of monstrous
element which I don't think had been part of my life before.''
   In ``Barfly,'' she said, she was able to show the results of
analysis in which she ``learned to relax as a person.''
   ``I'm more accepting of my vulnerability now,'' she said. ``I've
always had enormous insecurity, but I was always frightened of
showing that before, so I sort of hid behind whatever kind of
facade I could.''
   In her newest film, ``Midnight Cruising,'' Ms. Dunaway plays an
ophthalmologist blinded by glaucoma, which required her to learn
what sightlessness is like.
   ``Hearing became very important,'' she said. ``She (her
character) was always seeing with her ears. ... It makes you
realize how lucky you are.''

   Bill Cosby thinks Father's Day is ``the worst
day of any man's life'' and says the reason fathers don't fare as
well as mothers on their special day is because ``mothers cry and
fathers don't.''
   The comedian and other stars, including Paul Newman, John Ritter
and Tyne Daly, were interviewed about memories of their fathers in
the June issue of Woman's Day. Father's Day is June 19 this year.
   Cosby recalled how he used to shine shoes for a week before
Mother's Day to buy his mom, Anna, a present. But ``When Father's
Day came around, I'd run to the store and buy him (William Cosby
Sr.) two cigarettes _ and smoke one on the way home.''
   ``I think the reason for this difference is that mothers cry and
fathers don't,'' he said, adding:
   ``Next year I may put up billboards showing a father with a tear
running down his cheek. Maybe I'll go on a nationwide campaign with
my picture on billboards and a tear running down my cheek.
   ``I'm all for better presents on Father's Day,'' Cosby said.

<HEAD>Two White Officers Sentenced to Hang in Murder of Black</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two white policemen were
sentenced Thursday to hang for the murder of a young black man who
was beaten and then shot through the head after drunken officers
went on a ``black-bashing expedition.''
   They are the first white policemen in South Africa to face
execution for crimes committed while on duty in a black township.
Only six whites ever have been hanged here for killing blacks.
   The pivotal testimony against Warrant Officer Leon de Villiers,
37, and Constable David Goosen, 27, came from other members of
their 10-man riot unit who abandoned a cover-up attempt after being
pressured by investigators.
   Several officers testified that de Villiers, the unit leader,
ordered Goosen to ``take out'' Mlungisi Stuurman because the youth
had been beaten too severely to be set free. Stuurman, 18, was led
to a river bank and shot in the back of the head on July 26, 1986,
in the black section of Cradock, in eastern Cape Province.
   The non-jury trial took place in the Supreme Court at
Grahamstown, near Cradock.
   Goosen and de Villiers stood impassively as the sentence was
read. Their wives and some court employees broke into tears. Their
lawyer expressed his clients' regret for Stuurman's death, and the
officers were embraced by relatives and fellow policemen before
being led away.
   There was no date set for the execution.
   Justice N.W. Zietsman convicted the two men Wednesday, agreeing
with prosecutors that de Villiers had led his unit on a
``black-bashing expedition'' in which residents were assaulted
indiscriminately.
   On Thursday, Zietsman rejected the mitigation arguments
presented by the defense and also refused to grant permission for
the defendants to appeal the sentence.
   De Villiers' lawyer, Chris Jansen, had said his client was of
below average intelligence and was drunk at the time of the
shooting. Jansen said the defendants deserved sympathy because they
had been living with ``a sword over their heads'' for two years.
   Goosen testified that he suffered from post-traumatic stress
disorder because of repeated exposure to violence in black
townships. He also said he had an unhappy childhood during which he
was taunted because of his dark complexion.
   According to testimony during the trial, members of de Villiers'
squad drank heavily, conducted a blood-oath ceremony swearing
themselves to secrecy, then entered the township at about 3 a.m.
and assaulted several blacks.
   Following another bout of drinking at their base, the squad
returned to the township after daybreak.
   Stuurman, who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan ``Forward
To People's Power,'' was chased and grabbed by officers when he
tried to walk away from them, then was assaulted, several officers
testified.
   The officers said de Villiers ordered that Stuurman should be
``taken out'' because of the severity of his injuries.
   The defendants contended that the shooting was an accident. De
Villiers said he did not report the incident immediately because he
was still under the influence of alcohol.
   Stuurman's father, Jimmy, and his 21-year-old brother, Dan, said
in interviews last week in Cradock that they could not forgive the
policemen. They were not in court this week.
   Dan Stuurman, who was present in 1986 when the officers grabbed
his brother from their yard and forced him into a van, recalled
testifying against de Villiers and Goosen.
   ``I can still remember their faces very clearly, and when I had
to give evidence in court and I saw them again, I felt dizzy and
had to be taken outside.''
   ``Mlungisi was a good boy,'' said Jimmy Stuurman, 63. ``Even
while I am sitting here, I can see his face.''

   Japan must quickly reach agreement on lowering
import barriers to U.S. beef or face retaliatory action, a Montana
senator said Thursday.
   ``Japan has been saying for weeks that they'll come up with an
agreement, but it has not come home with the bacon,'' Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., told a news conference also attended by U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton K. Yeutter.
   Unless Japan moves swiftly to drop barriers to beef imports the
United States is likely to begin steps that could lead to
retaliation, Baucus said.
   An agreement under which the United States accepted Japanese
quotas on its exports of beef expired March 31. Since then, the
countries have been deadlocked on U.S. demands for an end to the
curbs and no increase in tariffs.
   Japan already represents the largest export market for American
beef. In 1986, U.S. beef exporters sold $500 million worth of the
product to the Japanese.
   The Agriculture Department estimates, however, that sales could
be expanded dramatically if Japan would eliminate its quota system
that limits imports of restaurant grade beef, for example, to
58,400 tons. USDA says exports might increase to $2 billion without
the restrictions.
   Yeutter said it was ``just imperative that the government of
Japan and the people of Japan commit themselves to true market
liberalization.'' He said the system of restrictions was ``not
mildly protectionist, it is blatantly protectionist.''
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., who like Baucus is a member of the
Senate Finance subcommittee on international trade, reiterated that
the United States was ``not asking for a guaranteed market.''
   ``We've never asked for a guaranteed market,'' Wallop said.
``We're asking for guaranteed access to that market.''
   He emphasized that Japanese beef prices are far above those in
the United States because of the restrictions.
   ``They are cheating their own consumers,'' Wallop said. ``They
are actually stealing from their own consumers.''
   The massive trade bill that Congress recently passed contains a
non-binding provision expressing the sense of the Senate that the
Japanese should drop their barriers to U.S. beef and citrus imports.

   About 40 activists wearing black hoods
peacefully took over the Mexican Embassy today and said they were
protesting water and electricity rationing in slum areas of the
capital.
   No weapons were seen among the people who occupied the embassy
in the Colombian capital. There were no known threats to harm
anyone or do any damage.
   The protesters demanded to talk with Attorney General Horacio
Serpa and the managers of Bogota's departments of electric power
and water.
   The Mexican ambassador, Rudolfo Figueroa, was not at the embassy
when the activists rushed into the embassy at 9 a.m., the embassy's
press officer, Constantino Morales, said in a telephone interview
from the embassy with the radio chain Caracol.
   Three embassy officials and an undetermined number of Colombian
employees were in the embassy when the protesters arrived, Morales
said.
   Morales said the three officials were himself, political adviser
Carlos Gonzalez and the consul, Sergio Savedra.
   The protesters had hired a bus, the bus driver, Marcos Conti,
said in an interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.
   As the bus approached the Mexican Embassy, the people on the bus
pulled on black hoods, Conti said. Two Colombian policemen guarding
the embassy, following standing Mexican Embassy instructions about
such takeovers, did not try to use their pistols.
   The intruders said they were members of the April 19 Movement.
   The military wing of the April 19 Movement, known as M-19,
seized the Dominican Republic's embassy and held 16 ambassadors
hostage there for two months in 1980.
   The M-19 also stormed the government's Palace of Justice in
Bogota in 1986. Ninety-five people, including 11 Supreme Court
justices, were killed.
   This is the third time in four years the Mexican Embassy has
been occupied by people with grievances against the government. The
previous occupations, by university students, were peaceful.
   Many of the poorest areas of Bogota, in the south, have had
water and electricity rationed for two months as the capital goes
through its worst drought in 53 years.
   The middle-class and upper-class homes in the northern part of
the capital have not been affected.

<HEAD>Six More Bodies Recovered From Golden Temple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal workers recovered six more
decomposed bodies and human bones from the Golden Temple complex
Thursday, and a police officer said as many as 15 more corpses
could be buried around the shrine.
   Two human skeletons, one male and the other female, were
recovered by the workers from the complex on Wednesday.
   In New Delhi, President Ramaswamy Venkataraman promulgated an
ordinance to prevent religious institutions from being used by
radicals and political parties.
   The ordinance bans the use of religious places for campaigns
against the state and calls for five years of hard labor for
violators, government officials said.
   The Golden Temple is the Sikhs' holiest shrine. Militant Sikhs
have been fighting for a separate state in the northern Punjab
region, where they form a majority.
   The workers in Amritsar on Thursday were joined by relatives of
people missing and feared killed by extremists in the temple.
   Amritsar Police Superintendent Baldev Singh said the remains
were ``people tortured and then killed by Sikh terrorists'' and
said a search was under way for more.
   Singh said the bodies recovered Thursday were of two females and
six males.
   ``We are getting lots of human bones and some skulls. It is a
terrible job down here,'' Singh told The Associated Press.
   The workers were seen removing two bagfuls of human bones
recovered from the debris.
   Sikh extremists had turned the Golden Temple into an armed camp.
The radicals were forced out during a police siege of the shrine
earlier this month.
   The siege, from May 9 to 18, resulted in the surrender of more
than 200 extremists and sympathizers. At least 46 people, most of
them Sikh radicals, were killed during the siege. Three other
radicals committed suicide by swallowing cyanide rather than face
arrest.
   There had been frequent reports that people were being detained
and tortured by militants inside the shrine. Several people were
reported missing by families after they went to the temple to pray.
   The Sikh religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam. Sikhs, who make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million population, claim they are
discriminated against by the majority Hindus.
   More than 1,150 people have been killed by Sikh extremists in
Punjab state since the start of the year. In 1987, 1,030 people
were killed.
   Indian security forces raided the Golden Temple in 1984, killing
1,200 people, mostly Sikhs. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered
the raid. Two of Mrs. Gandhi's Sikh guards assassinated her five
months later.

<HEAD>Fired University Official Indicted, Believed To Have Fled Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former University of Minnesota official
indicted in the disappearance of some $186,000 is believed to have
fled the country, authorities say.
   County Attorney Tom Johnson announced Wednesday that a grand
jury had returned indictments against Luther Darville, who was
fired last month by the university's Office of Minority and Special
Student Affairs.
   Johnson said authorities believe he is in the Bahamas.
   ``We will immediately begin pursuing a federal warrant for
unlawful flight,'' Johnson said. ``He is from the Bahamas, he has
family there.''
   If Darville is found in the Bahamas, extradition could be a
lengthy process, Johnson said.
   Darville was fired after a university audit showed $186,000
missing from the Office of Minority and Special Student Affairs
since 1983. Darville told auditors he had given money to 17
minority students, including nine football players.
   Evidence shows Darville used some of the money himself, Johnson
said. He said he didn't know how much of the money was spent on
athletes or other students.
   One former student athlete, Valdez Earl Baylor, told the Star
Tribune that Darville gave him about $5,000 in cash over a six-year
period. He said the money was handed to him in envelopes.
   Baylor, 24, who played football for the university from 1982 to
1985, said he received money on ``several occasions'' and used it
to fly home to Harrisburg, Pa., to pay rent and to buy food.
   Asked if he thought the arrangement might be illegal, Baylor
said: ``At that time, it didn't even matter to me ... as long as it
was understood that I didn't have to pay any of the money back.
   ``If they keep pursuing it, there's going to be a lot more
information about the athletic department,'' Baylor went on. ``Some
of the fellows might be willing to speak out later on, if they get
angry, and tell the real story. It stems deeper than Darville
giving out money.''
   He declined to elaborate.
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association rules prohibit
``the award of financial aid to a student-athlete that exceeds
commonly accepted educational expenses (i.e., tuition and fees,
room and board, and required course-related books), other than
legitimate loans, based upon a regular repayment schedule,
available to all students and administered on the same basis for
all students.''
   James Lawton, Darville's attorney, has said Darville broke no
laws and said he had never denied that Darville had assisted
athletes.
   University attorney Bill Donohue said the school was uncertain
whether NCAA rules had been violated. Donohue said the county
attorney had requested that the university hold off investigating
possible violations.
   NCAA officials said they had no comment on the case. The
school's athletic director, Paul Giel, also had no comment.

<HEAD>Other Countries See US Bases As Liability, Congress Told</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Appealing for an increase in foreign aid,
Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead told senators Thursday
that other countries increasingly see U.S. military bases as a
liability rather than an asset.
   ``This is a disturbing situation,'' he said.
   Whitehead mentioned Greece, Portugal, Turkey and the
Philippines, in all of which the United States is negotiating on
the future of its bases.
   The House on Wednesday approved a bill to provide $14.3 billion
in aid for the fiscal year beginning Sept. 30. The final amount
will depend on agreement between the House and Senate.
   The administration is asking for a 3.7 percent increase in
military aid, with all equipment being transferred for the first
time as grants rather than loans.
   ``Loans only add to our allies' burden of debt, which may not be
repaid anyway,'' Whitehead said.
   He was testifying before the foreign operations subcommittee of
the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Whitehead said an overall aid increase of 2 percent over this
year's level is needed to restore funds for key programs in
Portugal, South America, the Caribbean and Africa which either got
no money this year or were drastically cut.
   ``We cannot expect others to be dependable friends if we cannot
be one ourselves,'' he said.
   Edward J. Derwinski, undersecretary of state for security
assistance, said there is no debate about the need of the
Philippines for aid.
   ``As a newly restored democracy, an ally, and a country facing a
dangerous communist insurgency, the Philippines is looking for
significantly higher assistance levels from the United States, its
principal security partner,'' he said.
   Lt. Gen. Charles W. Brown, in charge of foreign aid at the
Pentagon, called the request of $110 million for the Philippines a
reasonable amount, saying that it was $15 million less than
Congress earmarked for this year.
   ``In addition, the amount of assistance that the Philippine
armed forces can optimally absorb this year is limited,'' he said.
   ``The Philippines requires a great deal of assistance to resolve
its security problems, but it should be applied in the context of
an efficient and reliable long-term program.''
   Whitehead questioned whether $45 million asked for Afghanistan
will be enough as five million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran
seek to return to their homes following the withdrawal of Soviet
troops.

<TEXT>
   Black South African guerrilla
leaders and white opponents of apartheid sharply disagreed Thursday
over the use of violence to attain their common goal, but they
pledged to hold further talks.
   Four representatives of the African National Congress met in
Frankfurt with eight members of South Africa's National Democratic
Movement.
   The meeting occurred the same day as two bomb blasts in Pretoria.
   Four people were injured in the blasts, which South Africa's
justice minister blamed on the ANC. The ANC is the largest
guerrilla group fighting South Africa's white-led government.
   Wynand Malan, a member of South Africa's Parliament and the
leader of the National Democratic Movement delegation, was asked if
the two sides had discussed violence carried out by the guerrillas
to promote their goals.
   ``We voiced not only our position, but our difference to that
strategy,'' Malan told reporters after the meeting.
   ``We also got an explanation from them again as to the origin of
the armed struggle. We can understand from their perspective
exactly what they are saying, but from our position we are still
fundamentally in disagreement to it,'' Malan said.
   The guerrilla group, based in Lusaka, Zambia, wages a bombing
and sabotage campaign in its bid to oust South Africa's government.
   By law and custom, South African apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   In a joint statement after Thursday's meeting, the two groups
said: ``Common ground was found in relation to the kind of South
Africa we would like to see. However, there were important
differences with respect to some aspects of the strategy through
which this could be achieved.''
   Also attending the press conference was Thabo Mbeki, spokesman
for the guerrilla group in West Germany.
   He defended use of force by the group, which was outlawed by
South Africa in 1960.
   ``That left us no choice but to take up arms. If those
conditions were to change, then of course the issue of whether to
continue or not continue the armed struggle would be
reconsidered,'' Mbeki said.
   Malan earlier defended the decision to meet the four executive
committee members of the guerrilla organization. ``This is a normal
further discussion with the ANC, seeking a common ground and
strategies out of the impasse,'' in South Africa, he told The
Associated Press at an interview in a Frankfurt hotel.
   ``It's the National Democratic Movement's policy to meet with
all political groupings,'' said Malan.
   He said the goal of the meeting was to seek ``common ground''
with the black resistance movement.
   Malan said West Germany was chosen as the meeting site because
``it was the quickest access to a mutually convenient venue.''
   The two sides at the Frankfurt meeting agreed to hold more
talks, though no date was given.

   As ``Rambo'' and ``Rocky,'' defeats are few and

women.
   ``Let's say I've developed suspicion to an art form,'' said
Stallone in the June 13 issue of US magazine, discussing his split

   ``You develop a sense of, like, protective paranoia,'' explained
Stallone, who also offered some advice on spotting women bent on

   ``Evil rises to the top eventually, like cream,'' Stallone said.
``You really got to look deeply into their eyes. You can see if
there's gentleness or there is barracuda living behind that
retina.''
   Stallone's problems with women aren't limited to his love life _
the muscular actor says he also has trouble with his mother, who
frequently offers her opinions on his life.
   ``I love her dearly, but she's her own woman,'' said Stallone.
``I say, `Why don't you please try this word, no comment, just this
one time. You'll feel good, really.' But that'll never happen.''

   Public schoolteachers went on strike for
the 17th day in three months Thursday to urge the Education
Ministry to increase its offer for pay raises.
   There were no immediate estimates on how many of Spain's 250,000
elementary and secondary instructors participated.
   Six trade unions, led by the Communist-oriented Workers
Commission, called the two-day strike and threatened an indefinite
walkout starting May 31.
   On May 4, five of the six unions tentatively reached an
agreement with the Education Ministry for a monthly pay increase of
$178 by September 1990.
   But in a May 16 referendum, 75 percent of the instructors
rejected the pact.
   The unions demand a $223 monthly raise.
   Elementary school teachers currently have an average monthly pay
of $929. Secondary and technical school teachers receive an average
monthly pay of $1,090.

<HEAD>Judge Was Early Target of Bribery Probe, Panel Told</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami
was a target of an FBI bribery conspiracy investigation from its
very beginning, a congressional panel conducting impeachment
proceedings against the jurist was told Thursday.
   FBI Agent William J. Murphy Jr., who directed the investigation,
said an informant, William Dredge, told the agency that William A.
Borders, a Washington lawyer and close friend of Hastings, had
bragged that he could bribe several judges, including Hastings.
   Murphy said the FBI had an undercover agent meet with Borders in
the fall of 1981 to discuss the possibility of bribing Hastings,
who was then hearing a case involving two convicted racketeers,
Frank and Tom Romano, in Miami.
   ``We were only trying to prove or disprove what (Dredge) said,''
Murphy told the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice.
   Later, he said, the undercover agent met with Borders and gave
him $120,000 as a partial payment to Hastings in return for a
lenient sentence to the Romanos and a return of a major portion of
seized assets.
   Borders was arrested after the money changed hands. He was
convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe for Hastings, was
sentenced to five years in prison and was fined $35,000. He served
33 months in the Allenwood, Pa., federal prison and 27 months on
parole and was subsequently disbarred by the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals.
   Hastings was acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges.
   Murphy said Hastings ``was a target from the outset. His name
was mentioned by Borders. We tried to prove or disprove the
allegation and it turned out to be true.''
   Rep. Patrick L. Swindall, R-Ga., asked: ``What predisposition
did the FBI have that Judge Hastings would accept a bribe?''
   ``None that I am aware of,'' replied Murphy.
   Swindall asked if the FBI's undercover operation wasn't ``a
classic, textbook entrapment.''
   Murphy denied the allegation, again saying that the FBI merely
investigated Dredge's charges to learn whether they were true or
false.
   He said Borders made the approach to the informant ``and he laid
out to (Dredge) what he would be able to do.''
   Murphy said the undercover operation ``was a tool to respond to
(Dredge's) allegations. If Borders didn't show up at the meeting
and didn't say the things he did, the case would have stopped.
   ``The information we were trying to prove or disprove was that
Borders and Judge Hastings were going to do a crime,'' he said.
``We didn't decide one day in the office to get Judge Hastings.''
   Murphy said that after arresting Borders, the FBI sought his
cooperation in getting evidence on Hastings. Borders refused to
wear a a hidden microphone and confront the judge.
   ``Based on the information we had, we believed he (Hastings) was
involved in the conspiracy,'' Murphy said in answer to a question
by Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr., R-N.Y. ``Had Borders cooperated, it
would have strengthened our case.''
   Borders refused to testify at both his own and Hastings' trials
or before the House subcommittee on Wednesday. He also refused to
appear before a five-judge investigative panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that was appointed shortly after Hastings
was acquitted.
   The judicial panel concluded that there was convincing evidence
that Hastings actually took part in a bribery scheme and then
attempted a cover-up by lying under oath and manufacturing evidence
at his trial.
   The panel's findings were endorsed unanimously by the Judicial
Conference of the United States, the chief policymaking body of the
federal judiciary and forwarded to House leaders in March 1987 with
the advice that ``consideration of impeachment may be warranted.''
   Hastings, who continues to sit on the bench in Miami, insists he
knew nothing of the bribery scheme and accuses Borders of using his
name to shake down the Romano brothers.

<HEAD>State to Pay Nursery Owner $2.6 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nursery owner has been awarded $2.6
million for 510,000 citrus trees the state destroyed in 1985 in a
program to control what was thought to be an incurable,
fast-spreading citrus canker.
   A judge and six-member jury decided Wednesday the state
Department of Agriculture had to pay Richard O. Polk for burning
his stock as part of a statewide program that destroyed millions of
trees.
   Polk had asked for $3 milllion in his suit.
   In a precedent-setting case in January, Circuit Judge Tim
Strickland ruled the agriculture department unnecessarily destroyed
Polk's stock after scientists testified that canker had been
misdiagnosed and there was never a real threat to the industry.
   ``It's a relief,'' said Polk. ``That's all an American citizen
can ask for is a fair day in court.''
   Attorney J. Davis Connor, co-counsel for Polk, said he hoped the
case might influence the state to settle other cases he plans to
file for affected nursery owners.
   The state, however, said it would appeal the award. It's also
appealing a $1.9 million award earlier this year to two Hardee
County nursery owners.

<HEAD>Bill To Limit Ads in Kiddie TV Shows Approved by House Panel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel on Thursday approved a bill to
limit the amount of advertising that may be shown during children's
television programs.
   The House Commerce and Energy Committee voted 39-3 to send the
measure to the House floor, where it is expected to win approval.
   The measure is a bipartisan compromise stripped of earlier
proposals to prohibit programs built around toy manufacturers'
products. Critics of these programs call them ``program-length
commercials.''
   Senate legislation on children's TV would bar these programs.
   The bill passed by the House committee would limit TV stations
to no more than 10{ minutes of commercials per hour during
children's shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during these
programs on weekdays.
   It also would require the Federal Communications Commission to
consider, when deciding whether to renew a station's license,
whether the station complied with the advertising limits and served
the educational needs of children in its overall programming.
   The National Association of Broadcasters, which has said it will
not oppose the House measure, says no stations would have
difficulty meeting the limits in the legislation.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor, former World
Bank President Robert S. McNamara and the Chinese Archaeological
Service have been honored by the Onassis Foundation with prizes
totaling $300,000.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou presented the awards at a ceremony
Thursday. The prizes are given annually in memory of the late
shipowner Aristotle Onassis and his son Alexander, who was killed
in a 1973 plane crash.
   Miss Taylor shared the $100,000 Aristotle Man and Society Prize
with French physician Daniel Defert for their campaigns against
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Defert was not present.
   ``I'm accepting on behalf of the loved ones who have suffered
not only the empty pain of losing someone dear but also the
humiliation of the abhorrent stigma of AIDS,'' Miss Taylor said.
   Miss Taylor, chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS, was
accompanied by Christopher Forbes, son of publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   McNamara, a former U.S. defense secretary, received the $100,000
Athinai Man and Mankind prize for his work in developing Third
World economies while heading the World Bank from 1968 to 1981.
   Chinese Deputy Culture Minister Wang Jifu accepted the $100,000
Olympia Man and his Environment prize on behalf of China's Bureau
of Museums and Archaeological Data. The award honored the
excavation of a 7,000-strong army of lifesize terracotta warriors
in the tomb of the Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi as a ``contribution to
East-West understanding.''

   The wife of soul singer James Brown says
she had nothing to do with causing a hotel-room fire that was the
basis of three charges against her.
   Adrienne Brown, 38, of Aiken, S.C., pleaded innocent Wednesday
in Merrimack District Court to possession of the drug PCP. The
charge is a misdemeanor punishable by a $1,000 fine and a year in
jail.
   She also was charged with arson and criminal mischief following
the May 10 fire in Bedford. She and her husband were in New
Hampshire for a concert.
   Under New Hampshire court procedures, defendants do not enter
pleas to felonies in district court.
   Mrs. Brown said she wasn't in the room when the fire began. She
was charged with possession of PCP based on lab tests on the
contents of a plastic container confiscated at the time of the fire.
   Bedford police Sgt. Roger Grenier said the criminal mischief
charge is a felony based on the amount of damage alleged, $1,500.

   Conservative talk-show host Morton Downey
Jr. says he objects to homosexuality, but will care for his
AIDS-stricken younger brother because ``he's my family.''
   Downey's 52-year-old brother, Tony, was a surprise guest on
Downey's recently taped program on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, said Cynthia Harrison, a spokeswoman for WWOR-TV, where
the show originates.
   Downey, 55, said his younger brother, who was diagnosed nine
months ago as having AIDS, would move to New Jersey from California
to stay with him and his family.
   ``He's my family and I'm going to take care of him,'' said
Downey, known for his anti-gay tirades on his soon-to-be nationally
syndicated program. ``I still object to what I call perverted love,
but nonetheless, he's my brother.''
   The program also deals with the high cost of AIDS drugs such as
AZT. Tony Downey pays $1,200 a week for the medication, said Ms.
Harrison.
   ``He (Tony) had told me a long time ago that if the time came
when there was no reversal, he would like to come on my show and
talk about his lifestyle to help people,'' Downey said. ``I had to
give him his moment.'' The show will be broadcast June 15 on WWOR.
   ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show'' will begin national syndication
Monday.

<TEXT>
   Corporations' after-tax profits edged up 0.5
percent in the first three months of the year, a much smaller
increase than in the last quarter of 1987, the government said
Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said after-tax profits rose to an annual
rate of $146.4 billion, following a gain of 2.6 percent in the
previous quarter.
   Manufacturing profits were up in the first quarter, with the
chemical industry enjoying the largest increases. Profits in the
transportation and utilities industries were down, while those in
financial industries showed a tiny gain.
   Analysts said the slowdown in profits showed that companies were
beginning to see some pressures from rising wages and higher costs
for component parts, especially if those parts are imported.
   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch in New
York, said that faced with rising demand, companies are likely to
begin boosting their prices in order to regain lost profit margins.
   ``Because of the squeeze on profits, there will be an incentive
on firms to raise their prices,'' he said, and these increases will
add to growing inflationary pressures.
   Among the details in the profits report:
   _Before-tax profits fell 1.8 percent in the first quarter, to an
annual level of $280.6 billion, after rising 0.2 percent in the
fourth quarter.
   _Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and
inventories, fell 1 percent to $309.9 billion, the second
consecutive quarterly decline.
   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, rose 1.2 percent to an annual
rate of $381 billion after a 0.5 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
   _Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.1 percent in the first
quarter to an annual rate of $99.3 billion following a 2.2 percent
rise in the fourth quarter.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
will make a pre-summit stopover here for talks with Dutch cabinet
officials, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said Thursday.
   Carlucci, who was attending a NATO defense ministers meeting in
Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday, was expected to arrive Friday,
according to spokesman Leonardo Williams. Carlucci is scheduled to
fly to Moscow on Sunday, the first day of the summit between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Williams said that talks ``on questions of mutual concern'' had
been planned for Friday between Carlucci and Dutch Premier Ruud
Lubbers, Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek and Defense Minister
Willem van Eekelen.
   On Thursday, Reagan was in Helsinki preparing for his fourth
meeting with Gorbachev.
   Williams refused to provide any details on Carlucci's visit.
   Spokesmen for the Dutch officials he is to meet said they were
surprised at the visit.
   ``We have no firm idea as to what he'll be precisely doing
here,'' a Dutch defense ministry spokesman said. ``We've just heard
of it (the visit).'' He delined to be identified by name in line
with Dutch government practice.
   Currently, there are few defense-related frictions between
Washington and the Netherlands.
   Relations between the two allies came under stress in the first
half of the decade, when successive Dutch governments waffled over
the controversial issue of deployment of 48 nuclear-tipped cruise
missiles on its soil.
   The issue was resolved 2{ years ago when Lubbers' government
decided in favor of deployment by late 1988, a decision made
obsolete by last December's superpower pact to eliminate
medium-range missiles from Europe.

   Religious education will mean more than
having a parochial school building in the parish, as Catholic
educators are charting a future that emphasizes adult education and
teaching children outside the traditional setting.
   Faced with continued enrollment declines, educators moved toward
a broader definition of Roman Catholic education during a weeklong
symposium on their future course.
   The concerns of those working with adults and with Catholic
children attending public schools dominated discussions, while
little talk was devoted to stopping the enrollment erosion at
parochial schools.
   The 300 participants in the Catholic Education Futures Project
left unfinished the work of writing a ``vision statement.'' But
they developed a list of priorities.
   Sister Suzanne Hall, an organizer, said the list reflected a
strong belief that Catholic education must embrace ``radical
aspects of the gospel, including education for peace and justice,
respect for all cultures'' and elimination of racism and sexism.
   Twenty-two organizations sent representatives to the symposium
at the University of Dayton, organized by the U.S. Catholic
Conference and the National Catholic Educational Association.
   Roman Catholic dioceses have lost 3 million students and 4,200
schools since 1965. Last year, 110 more schools closed their doors,
and enrollment fell by 103,000 to 2.6 million in the 8,992
remaining schools.
   In the United States, the Roman Catholic Church has more than 48
million members, making it the largest single body of Christians in
the nation.
   By the new, broader definition, ``Catholic education is not
getting smaller, it's getting larger,'' said the Rev. Thomas
Gallagher, secretary of education for the U.S. Catholic Conference.
``We're not going out of business.''
   Sister Georgette Zalewska, director of adult and religious
education for the Brooklyn, N.Y., diocese, said the church needs to
move beyond ``that school mentality'' and find new ways to educate
senior citizens, adolescents and adults.
   But Sister Patricia Bauch, an education professor at the
Catholic University of America who has studied largely black
parochial schools in inner cities, said the conference ignored the
needs of parents and other Catholic school ``consumers.''
   ``The church has come to see it is very expensive to operate
schools and therefore is looking for other ways to educate
people,'' Bauch said.
   Historically, the public school child who attended weekly
religion classes ``was considered a second-class citizen,'' said
Bishop James Malone of Youngstown.
   But archdioceses around the country are hiring paid, full-time
directors of religious education, like Janet Kayser, a laywoman who
runs the programs for St. Thomas Parish in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   ``When the topic of Catholic education comes up, there's too
much emphasis in thinking it means only schools,'' said Kayser, who
has 650 students in her programs.
   The Rev. Thomas Lynch, pastor of St. James Church in Bridgeport,
Conn., said he is trying to rename the parish school the St. James
Center for Religious Formation to stress prayer classes, scripture
study and other educational activities. But he said his
parishioners ``get nervous'' about such a change.
   Catholic schools must emphasize the teaching of faith ``just as
much as geography, math or anything else,'' said Lynch. He said he
sees no reason to operate a parochial school that ``smells like and
looks like the public school except for maybe a course in religion
and an amorphous Catholic environment.''
   Bishop Francis Schulte of West Virginia, who heads the bishops'
committee on education, said, ``There's no adequate substitute for
the full-curriculum Catholic school.'' But he acknowledged that
``very substantial areas'' exist where Catholic parents simply
don't have a parochial school available.
   Parochial schools flourished in big cities with immigrants from
Catholic lands like Ireland, Italy and Poland.
   ``In early times we saw ourselves in kind of a fortress
mentality to the white Protestant culture that was here,'' said
Brother Raymond Fitz, president of the University of Dayton.
   When Catholics became more affluent and moved to the suburbs,
churches followed, but schools did not.

   Vice President George Bush proposed on
Thursday that companies lacking ``drug-free programs'' be denied
government contracts. He also called for creation of an
international strike force to find and destroy drug crops.
   A Bush spokesman said the first proposal might include some form
of mandatory drug testing.
   Bush, in what aides described as a major anti-drug initiative,
said, ``I will make adoption of drug-free programs a condition of
obtaining federal contracts and I will ask the states to do the
same.''
   Bush outlined his drug plan, an expansion of previous anti-drug
proposals, at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in nearby Secaucus,
then underscored his proposals with a visit to a drug
rehabilitation center here, where he talked with patients who had
been drug addicts.
   Later, he was flying to his vacation retreat in Kennebunkport,
Maine, where he will spend a week on strategy and meetings with
Republican leaders and advisers.
   On the drug issue, Bush said that an international strike force,
possibly under the auspices of the United Nations, could ``wipe out
crops wherever they are grown and take out drug labs wherever they
exist.'' U.S. involement would be coordinated by a military officer
reporting to Bush's vice president.
   ``Our military forces have already made a substantial
contribution to our interdiction effort and today they're being
called upon to do more. Their primary target should be the
production of drugs abroad,'' he said.
   Bush also reiterated an earlier call for a Western Hemisphere
drug summit and said he would put his vice president in charge of
anti-drug efforts.
   On another topic, Bush also renewed his call for a federal
special prosecutor to investigate the finances of Democratic House
Speaker Jim Wright.
   Speaking to an Italian-American group at lunch, Bush said, ``We
hear a lot of flak from the Democrats on current ethical problems
in the administration,'' an apparent reference to the legal
investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   ``I wonder if Mike Dukakis and Jesse Jackson will join me in
calling for the House of Representatives to appoint a special
prosecutor to look into its own troubles, starting with the
speaker,'' he said.
   The private lobbying group Common Cause had earlier called for
an investigation, and Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., filed a formal
complaint about Wright with the House ethics committee Thursday.
   Gingrich's complaint, accompanied by a supporting letter signed
by 71 House Republicans, asked for an investigation in four areas,
including published reports that Wright received unusually high
book royalities from a printing company that did business with his
campaign committee.
   In Newark, Bush also told the Italian-American audience that,
while Dukakis should be proud of his Greek-American ancestry,
``he's not going to be the champion of ethnic America. I'm going to
be the champion of ethnic America.''
   Bush's comments on private companies and drugs marked the first
time he had sought to tie the war against drugs to government
contracts.
   His chief of staff, Craig Fuller, told reporters that the thrust
of the proposal was ``the vice president's notion that employers
should do everything possible to get drugs out of the workplace.''
   ``We didn't come today to write the regulations,'' Fuller said.
However, he said it was ``conceivable that testing of some kind
could be part of it.''
   Fuller said that the vice president saw ``a lot of merit to
random drug testing'' for government contractors. Bush has already
proposed mandatory testing for airline pilots, prison guards and
others who hold safety-related jobs.
   On still another subject, Fuller denied that the decision of
Peter Teeley to step down as Bush's campaign communications
director reflected dissension.
   Campaign aides said on Wednesday that Teeley, a longtime adviser
to Bush, would be reassigned to work on political issues. No reason
was given for the change.
   Teeley has been known to be at odds recently with Fuller.
However, Fuller said, ``I don't think there was a rift. There
wasn't a resignation.''

<TEXT>
   A court official said Thursday
that six Americans who were aboard a TWA jet commandeered in 1985
and relatives of a U.S. Navy diver killed in the ordeal will help
prosecute one of the suspected hijackers.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi goes on trial July 5 in a specially-built,
$7.5 million courtroom on charges of air piracy and murder in the
hijacking. The Americans' legal intervention allows their attorneys
to ask questions during court sessions.
   During a tour to show reporters the courtroom inside Frankfurt's
Preungesheim prison, court spokesman Falk Thomas said eight
Americans _including six people who were on the hijacked jetliner _
had formally intervened in the prosecution.
   ``Six are former hostages. The other two are relatives of
Stethem, I believe the parents,'' Thomas told reporters. He
declined to provide the names.
   Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot to death during the
hijacking. His parents, who live in Waldorf, Md., could not be
immediately reached for comment.
   The practice of legal intervention, common in the German system,
is sometimes called acting as a ``private prosecutor.'' It is
designed to ensure that victims' interests are properly represented
in criminal trials.
   It also gives the intervenors the right of appeal to a higher
court.
   They are not required to be present in the courtroom. However,
Thomas indicated that at least some of the Americans would be here.
   During to tour, the court spokesman said, ``Some of those people
who are coming as witnesses or intervenors in the prosecution could
feel threatened, and we don't want that to happen.''
   Four armed men hijacked the plane on June 14, 1985, on a flight
from Athens to Rome, and forced it to land in Beirut. Thirty-nine
Americans were held captive for 17 days.
   U.S. government officials have indicted Hamadi, but West Germany
refused to extradite him.
   Hamadi is in a Frankfurt prison awaiting trial.
   Thomas, the Frankfurt judge acting as spokesman for the Hamadi
trial, said that the construction costs of the courtroom came to
$7.5 million.
   Seats for 100 journalists and 80 members of the public are
separated from the judges, witnesses and defendant by huge plates
of bulletproof glass. The spectators will listen through a
loudspeaker system.
   Thomas said the trial will start July 5 with reading of the
indictment and a chance for Hamadi to make a statement.
   A juvenile court then will decide whether Hamadi was under 21
years old when the hijacking preparations started. If it rules he
was 21 or younger, then Hamadi would be subject to a maximum of 15
years in prison.
   If the court tries him as an adult, Hamadi could receive life in
prison.
   Hamadi has told West German authorities he was born on June 13,
1964, but he later said he was younger.
   West German and U.S. officials believe he is 23 years old.
   Hamadi's 29-year-old brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, was sentenced by
a Duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two West
Germans in Beirut in a failed attempt to gain freedom for his
younger brother.

<HEAD>Authorities Unusually Tolerant At Pre-Summit Jewish Demonstration</HEAD>

   Authorities allowed an unusually large
demonstration Thursday by Soviet Jews who have been denied
permission to emigrate and who urged President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to take up their cause at the
superpower summit.
   Despite the tolerance of the protest, a Leningrad refusenik, the
term for Jews refused permission to leave the country, said the KGB
secret police has warned him against accepting an invitation to
meet Reagan on Monday.
   Reagan plans to meet Monday afternoon at Spaso House, the U.S.
ambassador's residence, with the activists and refuseniks to
underscore his concern for human rights problems. The Soviet
government has not objected to the meeting.
   On Thursday, Soviet officials holding a news conference on the
summit said who the president meets with is his business.
   ``The U.S. president, who will be our guest in Moscow, is
certainly free to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds
interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the
official events,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F.
Petrovsky said.
   But, he added, ``This American move is hardly aimed at improving
mutual understanding between the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.''
   Dozens of uniformed and plainclothes policemen shouted at the
demonstrators to disperse and ripped down some of the protester's
posters during the 1{-hour protest within sight of the Kremlin,
where Reagan and Gorbachev will meet starting Sunday.
   But unlike past protests, the officers did not arrest or detain
any of the demonstrators, gathered outside the Lenin Library as
Western journalists watched.
   One uniformed militiaman, asked why the demonstrators were not
hauled away, responded in one word: ``Perestroika.'' That is
Gorbachev's policy of restructuring Soviet society, including some
greater tolerance of dissent and somewhat freer emigration.
   ``A World Without Missiles or Refuseniks,'' proclaimed one large
banner, made of wallpaper. ``We Welcome the Summit,'' read another
poster, which plainclothes KGB officers ripped from the hands of
30-year-old Marina Durnovo.
   Roald ``Alec'' Zelichonok, who has been refused permission to
emigrate for more than 10 years, said he received a letter and
telephone call Tuesday from the U.S. Embassy inviting him to take
part in Monday's meeting with Reagan. Shortly after the embassy
phone call, he said, a KGB officer telephoned.
   ``This officer called and said in light of security measures
around Moscow, my departure for Moscow will not be permitted,''
Zelichonok said by telephone from his Leningrad home.
   Zelichonok, 51, said the officer warned him that if he traveled
to Moscow, ``administrative measures'' carrying possible penalties
of detention, house arrest or up to 15 days in jail would be taken
against him. He said he thought the warning may have been prompted
by his plan to present Reagan a book he and another refusenik wrote
about 18 would-be emigres who died awaiting permission to leave the
country.
   Zelichonok said he intends to attend the meeting with his wife
despite the warning.
   Soviet authorities have cleared the capital of ``undesirables''
during previous international events, such as the 1980 Summer
Olympics.
   The demonstrators said they want human rights to figure
prominently in the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings.
   ``We very much hope that the summit brings success in the area
of freedom of emigration,'' said Ms. Durnovo. ``America is our
hope, our support, the only country the opposes our country.''
   Asked why she wanted to leave the Soviet Union and settle in the
United States, Ms. Durnovo replied: ``It's impossible to live in
this country. I won't be alive by the time there are results of
perestroika,'' said Ms. Durnovo, a 30-year-old Moscow Jew who
applied to emigrate about six months ago. She said she had not been
denied permission to leave yet, but that ``there's never a
guarantee.''
   Many of the protesters were from Leningrad, although
demonstrators said about 15 of them who tried to travel to Moscow
were taken off a train bound for the capital by KGB officers. Other
protesters came from the Ukraine, Lithuania and Moldavia.
   The U.S.-based National Conference on Soviet Jewry reported last
week that 1,086 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union in
April, the highest monthly total in nearly seven years.
   The figure has been rising for about a year, but it falls far
short of the 1979 levels, when the monthly average was about 4,000
departures.

<HEAD>State Will Tear Down Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>

   The Shoreham nuclear power plant, long a
burden to Long Island Lighting Co., will be taken over by the state
and torn down under an agreement reached Thursday by state
officials and the utility.
   If the agreement, which is subject to many conditions, goes
through, it would be the first time a completed nuclear power plant
was abandoned before it opened.
   The deal calling for LILCO to sell the $5.3 billion plant to the
state for $1 was a victory for opponents of the facility 55 miles
east of Manhattan on the north shore of Long Island.
   At a news conference Thursday, Gov. Mario Cuomo said the plant
should be torn down, rather than mothballed, to prevent its
resurrection.
   ``That would be very much like taking a loaded rifle and storing
it in the closet,'' said Cuomo. ``Maybe someday that NRA (National
Rifle Association) will take over and then we can use it.''
   U.S. Rep. George Hochbrueckner, whose district includes the
plant, agreed. ``We've shown Shoreham the cross, but we have to put
a stake through its heart,'' he said.
   While Cuomo said a few details remain to be worked out, he
insisted, ``We have gotten everything we wanted.''
   ``Shoreham has to die, Shoreham will die,'' he said.
   The Shoreham project, begun in 1965, ended up 10 years behind
schedule and more than 80 times as expensive as originally
predicted, driving LILCO to the edge of bankruptcy.
   Completed in 1984, it never went into service because of the
refusal by state and local officials to participate in emergency
evacuation planning. They argued that Long Island, because of its
geography, could not be safely evacuated during a nuclear accident.
   The densely populated, narrow island, with about 2.5 million
residents outside of New York City, extends eastward about 120
miles from Manhattan. In the event of an evacuation, residents
would have to leave either by boat or head westward.
   Without such a plan, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission refused
to issue anything more than a low-power testing license for
Shoreham.
   State efforts to close Shoreham accelerated after the NRC in
October eliminated the rule requiring state and local government
participation in an evacuation plan. The state had been proceeding
with a possible takeover of the company, and Cuomo had set a
midnight Wednesday deadline for the conclusion of negotiations.
   The announcement of a tentative agreement between the state and
LILCO came about 1{ hours after that deadline.
   For LILCO, the settlement would allow it to continue to operate
as a privately owned utility.
   The entire agreement must be approved by the state Public
Service Commission, and some parts of it need the Legislature's
approval. New generating plants would then be built on Long Island
to ensure an adequate supply of electricity.
   The deal also is subject to LILCO being able to obtain an
investment rating that will allow it to refinance $2 billion of its
debt at lower interest rates.
   And any decommissioning plan would be subject to NRC approval,
said agency spokesman Frank Ingram. While that could give the NRC
the ability to block the dismantling, Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer
said he felt the NRC would consider only safety issues in ruling on
plans to raze the plant.
   Under the tentative agreement, LILCO would pay for
decommissioning, which could cost $500 million, said Cuomo aides.
But the utility would be allowed to raise its electric rates by 5
percent annually for the next three years, and rate increases of 5
percent annually would be the target for the following seven years.
   LILCO's nearly 1 million customers pay the second-highest
electric rates in the country, second only to neighboring
Consolidated Edison in the New York City area.
   The governor said the agreement, if finalized, would have no
negative impact on rates for customers of other utilities in the
state.
   The settlement calls for action by the Public Service Commission
on the rate structure issue within 90 days of the proposal's filing
with it, expected in a few days. During the 90-day period, LILCO
agreed not to turn up the power at Shoreham even in the unlikely
event that it obtained the 25 percent power operating license it
had been seeking from the NRC.
   Cuomo has called LILCO's management ``arrogant and cynical,''
and insisted on company reforms. But he said Thursday that LILCO
and the state had yet to work out exactly what they would be. He
said it might be good if LILCO Chairman William Catacosinos
remained ``for the time being.''
   In addition to the tentative settlement with the state, LILCO is
also trying to negotiate an end to a $8.7 billion racketeering case
filed against the utility by Suffolk County officials and
individual homeowners.

   Two flight instructors successfully
ejected from a TA4J Skyhawk Navy training jet that crashed and
burned Thursday in a forest, authorities said.
   The officers were picked up by a search helicopter and returned
safely to base, said Lt. j.g. Mary Chamberlin, spokeswoman for the
Meridian Naval Air Station in Mississippi.
   They were identified as Marine Capt. Thomas Henry Renken and
Navy Lt. j.g. Timothy John Roorda, who was being examined for a
possible broken leg.
   Chamberlin said the jet, based at Meridian, Miss., was on a
routine training mission and crashed 11:45 a.m. in the Scotch
Wildlife Management area in southwest Alabama, 13 miles west of
Grove Hill.
   The crash sparked a wildfire near Alabama Highway 154 that was
fought by state forestry fire crews.
   There were no other injuries.

   Authorities filed charges of passport violations
Thursday against a man they suspect is one of nine Japanese Red
Army terrorists who hijacked a Japanese airliner to North Korea in
1970, when he was only 16.
   Hideo Marutani of the district prosecutor's office in Kobe,
western Japan, said Yasuhiro Shibata, 34, would be turned over to
Tokyo police ``in the next couple of days'' for investigation on
possible hijacking and related charges.
   Investigators from Kobe, who arrested Shibata in Tokyo on May 6,
said he obtained the passport in Yokohama in July 1986 using the
name of a Kobe man with dual Japanese and North Korean citizenship.
The man had returned to North Korea in 1972 without disclaiming
Japanese citizenship, they said.
   Marutani, interviewed by telephone, gave no further details. He
said Shibata could be sentenced to three years in prison if
convicted on the passport charges.
   A convicted hijacker not charged with murder in Japan is subject
to a maximum term of life in prison, the prosecutor said.
   Hijackers seized the Japan Air Lines Boeing 727, which had 138
people aboard, on a domestic flight. They went first to South
Korea, where they traded some passengers for a Japanese vice
minister of transportation, then to Pyongyang, capital of communist
North Korea, where the rest of the hostages were freed.
   Police said Shibata returned to Japan in April 1985 by an
unknown route, held part-time jobs and traveled several times to
Europe on the false passport.
   Shibata is the only one of the nine alleged hijackers arrested,
and police say he is the only one known to have returned to Japan.
One of the others is said to have died in North Korea recently of
an undisclosed illness.
   A spokesman for the national police said recently, on condition
of anonymity, that he was certain North Korean officials knew of
Shibata's return to Japan. ``He couldn't have left North Korea
without the permission of the North Korean government,'' the
spokesman said.
   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency called
Japanese allegations of North Korean complicity ``groundless
slanders'' and said of the hijackers: ``We did not mind where they
went, regarding it as their right proceeding from their free will.''
   Japanese officials said police had questioned Shibata about his
activities in Europe but said it still was too early to say whether
Europe was being used as a Red Army base.
   Osamu Maruoka, the Red Army's reputed No. 2 man, and Yu
Kikumura, an alleged Red Army member arrested in the United States
in April for possessing explosives, are believed to have traveled
in Europe before their arrests.
   Maruoka was arrested in Japan in November.
   Two more Red Army suspects, Junzo Okudaira and Fusako Shigenobu,
are being sought by police in Italy for suspected involvement in a
car bomb attack at a U.S. military club in Naples, also in April.
   The arrests and bombing have caused speculation that the
long-dormant terrorist group is planning a comeback, possibly on
the occasion of the Toronto summit of seven industrialized
countries June 19-21, or the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea,
beginning in September.
   The Red Army was formed in 1968 and had no more than 300 members
at its peak, police say. Following police crackdowns in the late
1960s, about 30 members slipped out of Japan to operate abroad.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Gets Formal Complaint To Investigate Wright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative Georgia congressman, supported
by 71 House Republican colleagues, asked the House ethics committee
Thursday to investigate allegations that Speaker Jim Wright has
violated House ethics rules.
   The request from Rep. Newt Gingrich, a leader of the Republican
right in the House, came one week after a similar call from the
government watchdog group Common Cause for an ethics committee
investigation of Wright.
   Under House rules, Gingrich's complaint will require the panel,
formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,
to vote on whether to investigate Wright, D-Texas. The committee is
made up of six Democrats and six Republicans.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, declined
comment on Gingrich's complaint, but Wright told reporters he hoped
the committee will resolve the issue quickly.
   ``I feel certain I have not violated House rules,'' Wright said.
``I most certainly have never intended to do so.''
   As for Gingrich, who has been calling publicly for such an
investigation since December, Wright said, ``My views toward him
are similar to those of a fire hydrant toward dogs.''
   Gingrich's complaint asked the ethics committee to investigate
published allegations about Wright in four areas, two of which
involved his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   The complaint cited reports that Wright received unusually high
royalties of 55 percent on the book, which was published by a
printing company that received nearly $300,000 worth of business
from Wright's campaign committee in 1985-86.
   The complaint asked the committee to determine if the royalty
arrangement violated House rules and if Wright's relationship with
the company was used by the speaker as a way to convert campaign
funds to personal use.
   The complaint also asked for an investigation into published
reports of Wright's 1979 intervention with Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat in behalf of a businessman who earlier had allowed Wright to
invest in a proven oil well, and his 1979 intervention with the
Department of Interior to influence a gas lease decision involving
a company in which Wright owned $15,000 worth of stock.
   He said the incidents provide ``direct examples of the use of
public office for personal enrichment.''
   Common Cause cited Wright's book and his financial dealings with
its publisher in its call for an investigation last week, but not
the two 1979 incidents.
   The self-styled citizens lobby also asked for an investigation
into allegations that Wright violated federal ethics rules while
seeking special treatment from the federal Home Loan Bank Board for
Texas constituents and Democratic contributors.
   The 71 House Republicans who signed a letter to the ethics
committee supporting Gingrich's complaint included the entire House
GOP leadership except Rep. Robert H. Michel of Illinos.
   As Gingrich was announcing his complaint against Wright, the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee issued a statement
charging that Gingrich received $13,000 from wealthy friends in
1977 to write a novel he never produced.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr., D-Ark., chairman of the DCCC, said the
objective of the partnership arrangment that provided the $13,000
to Gingrich apparently was ``to allow Gingrich a means for
financial gain not available to the average American.''
   Gingrich said in response that he was paid the $13,000 for a
summer's work researching the novel, but an agent who reviewed the
initial chapters told him he was ``far better at shaking hands than
writing fiction.''
   Gingrich noted he was not a member of Congress in 1977, and
said, ``No one was trying to gain influence over an assistant
college professor.''

   An intense propane fire ran out of gas
Thursday, ending a two-day ordeal that forced 500 families from
their homes and shut down a commuter railroad line to New York City.
   The fire in a 2,500-gallon tanker, overturned on the
Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway, burned itself out at 6:30 a.m.
   ``The tank was empty,'' Inspector Nelson Finkelman of the county
fire marshal's office. ``It literally ran out of gas.''
   ``It was the equivalent of a small bomb,'' Nassau County
Executive Thomas Gulotta said. ``If this tank had exploded it would
have devastated everything within a 1,000-foot radius.''
   Finkelman said the fire burned out sooner than expected,
probably because the tanker was not full when it overturned
Tuesday. It also burned faster after firefighters opened a vent on
the tanker Wednesday to increase consumption of the liquid.
   Within three hours after the fire was out, Long Island Rail Road
began operating trains again on the Babylon line. The truck
overturned just 2,000 feet south of the LIRR track. The Sunrise
Highway and the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway also were reopened.
   LIRR said 30,000 rail commuters were affected. And 70,000
motorists were forced to find alternate routes. About 500 families
were urged to evacuate, and many slept in cots in school gymnasiums.
   The accident occurred when defective springs in the truck broke,
shifting the truck's weight, which in turn caused the drive shaft
to separate and the rear portion to dig into the ground.
   The broken shaft acted as a catapult, overturning the truck,
said Ken Cynar, a spokesman for Gulotta.
   The driver and a passenger escaped with minor cuts and bruises.
The driver was charged with driving with a suspended license.
   Gulotta said the county may sue Conservative Gas of Wyandanch,
which owned the tanker and serves 40,000 residential and commercial
customers.
   Nassau County Comptroller Peter King said the emergency cost the
county more than $300,000 in overtime, salaries and equipment.

<HEAD>Study Says Rival Afghan Guerrilla Groups Will Rush for Kabul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Afghan guerrilla groups will race to seize
Kabul from the Communist government when Soviet troops are gone,
and the result could be chaos, the International Institute for
Strategic Studies said Thursday.
   It also predicted in its annual survey that the U.S.-Soviet
summit starting Sunday in Moscow will produce a reasonable chance
of agreement before President Reagan leaves office on cutting
stocks of long-range nuclear weapons in half.
   ``I don't expect a deal to be cut at the Moscow summit, but I
think we can forsee progress,'' Hans Binnendijk told a news
conference Wednesday before the ``Strategic Survey 1987-88'' was
released. He is director of studies for the London-based research
group.
   ``There is a reasonable prospect that this can be settled before
the end of the Reagan administration'' in January, he said.
   The survey said the Kremlin may try to retain influence in
Afghanistan by exploiting ethnic rivalries and would prefer
Lebanon-style chaos to the total collapse of the government it
leaves behind. The Soviets have agreed to withdraw their estimated
soldiers within nine months.
   ``If and when the Soviet Union withdraws from Afghanistan ...
there will be a race to Kabul'' by guerrilla groups, according to
the 240-page report.
   It said the seven-party alliance of Moslem guerrillas probably
will collapse and the remnants of President Najib's administration
``could seek out local alliances with parts of the warring
factions.''
   ``There could be a power vacuum in Kabul and isolated fronts
fighting each other on the basis of ethnic and political rivalries,
allowing the Soviet Union to retain a foothold,'' the survey said.
``Chaos and the `Lebanonization' ... are better outcomes for Moscow
than signing the death warrant'' of Najib's regime.
   A tribally fragmented Afghanistan would suit Pakistan as a
buffer zone with the Soviet Union, and also Iran, which wants to
retain supremacy with the Shiite Moslem minorities, the study
found. Pakistan and Iran are Afghanistan's neighbors on the east
and west.
   Binnendijk's organization sees the possibility of the Red Army
retaining bases in northern Afghanistan and direct influence over
the area.
   ``Were this to turn out to be the eventual `solution,' it would
at best produce a stabilization of the `warring kingdoms' under a
weak central government; at worst it would result in complete
chaos, leading sooner or later to yet another Afghan crisis,'' the
report said.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978, and the Soviet Union sent military forces to Afghanistan in
December 1979. The Soviet withdrawal began May 15 and half its
soldiers are to be out by Aug. 15.
   The International Institute for Strategic Studies is an
international, non-governmental center for research on security and
arms control funded largely by private foundations. Its members and
staff come from 70 countries.
   On East-West relations, the survey said the superpower agreement
to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles and other developments
during 1987 created ``the sense that significant, and perhaps
fundamental, changes were under way was almost palpable.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms coincided with
Reagan's ``vision of a non-nuclear world and his apparent wish .. .
to leave his stamp on history,'' the report said.
   ``It was the confluence of both superpowers' views that each
could gain from a change in their security relationship and their
respective adjustments to economic difficulties that produced the
sense that 1987 might be a watershed year,'' the researchers
concluded.
   They reached these conclusions in two other areas:
   MIDDLE EAST _ There is ``a shift of focus among key Arab
governments'' to the view that the Iran-Iraq war, nearly eight
years old, is a greater threat to their security than Israel.
   LATIN AMERICA _ Drug dealers emerged as ``a pre-eminent national
security concern'' in Colombia, and in Panama narcotics traffickers
led by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ``have become the government. .
.. In its ability to subvert societies and seize control of
governments, `narcoterrorism' may already be on a par with
communism as a threat to Western interests in Latin America.''

   Blood tests on Air Force veterans who were
assigned to spray defoliants like Agent Orange in Vietnam show
``unusually heavy'' levels of exposure to dioxin, the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control said Thurdsay.
   The CDC reported results of blood testing among 147 Air Force
men who served in the ``Operation Ranch Hand'' defoliation
activities. But the report drew no conclusion about how _ if at all
_ the men's dioxin exposure might affect their health.
   At least 1,200 men participated in ``Operation Ranch Hand,'' the
code name for the continuing aerial spraying conducted by the Air
Force during the Vietnam War.
   The high levels exposure to the toxic chemical among the Ranch
Hand personnel didn't necessarily come as a surprise, said Dr.
Larry L. Needham, a CDC researcher.
   Sixty-two percent, or 91, of the 147 Ranch Hand veterans who
were tested showed blood-dioxin levels of more than 20 parts per
trillion, commonly regarded as the upper threshold for dioxin
exposure in the general population, CDC researchers said.
   The average blood-dioxin level among the men was 49 parts per
trillion; three Ranch Hand airmen had exposure levels over 200
parts per trillion and two had levels over 300 parts per trillion,
the CDC said.
   In a ``control'' group of 49 veterans, tested for comparison
purposes, only one man had a blood-dioxin level over 20 parts per
trillion _ and he had been exposed to industrial chemicals since
1980 at an Indiana steel foundry, the CDC said.
   The blood tests indicate ``that some Ranch Hand personnel had
unusually heavy TCDD (dioxin) exposure,'' the Atlanta-based agency
said. However, the agency noted, ``no threshold level has been
determined as yet for the health effects of TCDD in humans.''
   Earlier, the CDC reported on blood-dioxin levels among Army
ground troops potentially exposed to Agent Orange, Needham noted.
   ``The one big difference we are seeing,'' he said, ``is the ...
Army ground troops ... did not seem to have elevated exposures.''
   Only two out of 646 such soldiers had blood-dioxin levels over
20 parts per trillion, Needham said.
   Dioxin is a toxic chemical to which virtually all people have
been exposed somewhat, through the environment. However, dioxin
contamination of Agent Orange and other herbicides used to clear
the jungles in Vietnam war operations has prompted concern about
the health of military personnel exposed to such agents.
   A study released in March showed no unusual health problems to
date among more than 1,000 Vietnam veterans who were involved in
the spraying of Agent Orange.
   That study drew criticism because it used estimated exposure
levels.
   New techniques make it possible for scientists to detect dioxin
levels in human blood even years after exposure. The test results
announced Thursday, part of a 1987-88 Air Force investigation, are
from the first ``appreciable'' number of those tests performed on
Ranch Hand personnel, Needham said.
   A report on the 1987-88 Air Force Health Study will be published
after blood-dioxin tests have been completed on all participants
and the report passes executive branch review, the CDC said.

   A military training plane on a test
flight crashed in the northern Philippines on Thursday and killed
three soldiers, a Philippine air force spokesman said.
   Lt. Epifanio Panzo told The Associated Press an investigation
was under way into the cause of the accident in the mountain resort
city of Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila.
   Panzo said the three-seat Marchetti FF-260 plane crashed short
of the Baguio airport and burst into flames. He said the three air
force soldiers on board died instantly.
   A radio station in Baguio monitored in Manila quoted residents
near the area as saying the plane slammed into a wall and landed on
a parked car a few miles from the airport.
   Panzo identified the victims as Maj. Amador Feleo, Lt. Roberto
Guerra and Sgt. Rafael de Castro, all of the air force's 100th
training wing unit.
   In June, 50 people were killed when a Philippine Airlines HS-748
crashed near the Baguio airport.

   A high school teacher who pleaded guilty
to eight drunken driving charges will spend the summer and 37
weekends in jail and pay a $5,000 fine.
   Curtis Burton, 41, said at Wednesday's sentencing that he has
told his English students at Bel Air High School about his drinking
problem.
   ``I would like to say I'm remorseful,'' he told Judge D. Clark
Hughes and the crowded courtroom. ``I'm sorry. I can't apologize
for my disease because alcoholism is a disease.''
   Burton was arrested on drunken driving charges in October 1984,
three times in 1985, once in 1986 and twice in 1987. His last
arrest was in January.
   He was not tried until Wednesday because of a backlogged docket,
scattered records and court delays requested by defense attorneys,
prosecutors said.
   After serving a jail sentence from July 4 to Aug. 31, Burton
will go to jail on 37 consecutive weekends. Then he will be on
probation for eight years. His driver's license was revoked
Wednesday.
   Burton's principal and some teachers presented the judge with
character references. Burton told Hughes he has been attending
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and is receiving counseling.
   ``I'm grateful that nothing tragic has happened,'' Burton said.
``I'm trying hard to overcome this disease and will be doing my
best to see that this never, ever happens again.''

Back-To-Back Shows</HEAD>

   CBS announced Thursday it is canceling
``Cagney & Lacey'' and bringing back Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van
Dyke in separate comedies this fall as the network struggles to get
out of third place in the ratings where it ended up this season for
the first ever.
   In an effort to draw younger viewers, the network is adding a
number of comedies, including a half-hour romantic comedy based on
the hit movie ``Dirty Dancing.''
   ``Cagney & Lacey,'' one of CBS's most popular and prestigious
shows, has been canceled, and the critically acclaimed ``Frank's
Place'' has been put on the shelf until a place in the schedule can
be found for it, CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said.
Also held back for mid-season were ``Kate & Allie,'' ``Simon &
Simon'' and ``Jake and the Fatman.''
   Besides ``Cagney & Lacey,'' other shows cut from the schedule
are ``Eisenhower & Lutz,'' ``High Mountain Rangers,'' ``Houston
Knights,'' ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.''
   Van Dyke and Miss Moore, who played a married couple on the
1960s hit ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' will star in back-to-back
comedies on Wednesdays.
   In ``The Van Dyke Show,'' at 8 p.m. Eastern time, stars Van Dyke
and his real-life son, Barry, in a comedy about a turbulent
relationship between a father and son. Van Dyke plays a star of
Broadway helping his son run a struggling theater company.
   Miss Moore, whose yet untitled show follows at 8:30 p.m., plays
an independent divorcee named Annie Block who hooks up with a
recently widowed construction engineer played by Edward J. Moore.
Eileen Heckart plays Annie's ultraliberal mother, and John Randolph
plays his archconservative father.
   Patrick Cassidy and Melora Hardin star in ``Dirty Dancing,''
based on the movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. The
two play headstrong kids in the 1960s working at a resort owned by
her father, played by McLean Stevenson of ``M-A-S-H'' fame.
   Candice Bergen, in her first series, stars as a successful
television reporter in ``Murphy Brown.''
   Other new shows:
   _``Close To Home,'' a half-hour comedy about the relationship
between a teen-age girl (Royana Black) and her father (James
Naughton).
   _``Almost Grown,'' an hour drama that follows a New Jersey
married couple (Tim Daly and Eve Gordon) through three decades,
with an emphasis on the music that bound them through dating,
mating, maturing and enduring.
   _``Paradise,'' an hour drama about a Western gunfighter (Lee
Horsley) who unexpectedly ``inherits'' his sister's four young
children.
   _``TV 101,'' an hour drama about a journalism teacher (Sam
Robards) who tries to bring a high school newspaper into the
television age. It's the first show from Grant Tinker's GTG
Entertainment.
   LeMasters said taking ``Frank's Place'' off the schedule was
``one of the toughest decisions I had to make.''
   ``It's an extraordinary show,'' he said. ``But what it boiled
down to was, would I put it on the schedule to be bounced around,
or would I take the heat and hold it for an advantageous time
period.''
   He said CBS was committed to 13 episodes of ``Frank's Place.''
   ``The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama `Cagney & Lacey'
was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said LeMasters.
``But the show had suffered the slings and arrows. We felt it was
time for it to go off before it got beaten up more.''
   ``Cagney & Lacey'' was canceled in 1983, but CBS brought it back
the following year after a letter-writing campaign by fans.
   LeMasters said ``Kate & Allie'' was being held back because he
wanted to take a more aggressive approach to Monday programming.
   LeMasters said the decision to retain two news shows, ``48
Hours'' and ``57th Street,'' in addition to the popular ``60
Minutes'' was unrelated to the writers strike. News show writers
are not member of the striking Writers Guild of America. LeMasters
said the shows were kept on the schedule on the basis of quality.
   The writers strike, which began March 7, threatens to delay the
beginning of the new season for the networks, though NBC will be
able start in September with prime-time coverage of the Summer
Olympics. CBS announced last month that it would delay the season
at least until late October.
   Talks between producers and the striking writers recently
resumed through a federal mediator.
   Here is the CBS prime-time schedule for the fall:
   _ Monday: ``Newhart,'' ``Coming of Age,'' ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women,'' ``Almost Grown.''
   _ Tuesday: ``TV 101,'' ``CBS Tuesday Movie.''
   _ Wednesday: ``The Van Dyke Show,'' ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Series,'' ``The Equalizer,'' ``Wiseguy.''
   _ Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Paradise,'' ``Knots Landing.''
   _ Friday: ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   _ Saturday: ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``Tour of
Duty,'' ``West 57th Street.''
   _ Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''

   A decomposed body found Thursday in a
mortician's bag may be that of reputed mobster John DiGilio, who
disappeared three weeks ago, state and federal officials said.
   ``There's every reason to believe it is John DiGilio,'' said
Col. Clinton L. Pagano, superintendent of state police.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said credit cards with
DiGilio's name on them were found on the body. If the body is not
too decomposed, fingerprints could be taken for identification, he
said.
   ``We want to get the dental records,'' said Bayonne police Capt.
Tom Lavin. ``That's how badly decomposed it was.''
   Authorities identify DiGilio, a 55-year-old former boxer, as a
soldier in the Genovese organized crime family. After his
disappearance was reported May 7, law enforcement officials
speculated he was killed in an organized crime dispute.
   DiGilio was a colorful figure, acting as his own attorney in a
federal waterfront racketeering trial that ended with his acquittal
last month, often inviting boxing celebrities to court and filing a
harassment suit against federal officials.
   That flamboyance, authorities say, may have led to his death.
   Intelligence indicated that other Genovese family members were
dissatisfied with DiGilio's high profile, and that reputed family
boss Vincent ``Chin'' Gigante sanctioned the hit, officials said.
   DiGilio was to be sentenced on a state loansharking charge May
19, and authorities had also speculated his disappearance was a
ploy connected with sentencing. He has won frequent delays in
trials through claims of mental problems.
   But at the sentencing hearing, DiGilio's lawyer said the only
likely reason for his client's absence was foul play. At the court
proceeding, the judge issued a warrant for DiGilio's arrest.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Sentence Should be Appealed; Woman Ordered to Use
Birth Control</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Constitutional grounds probably exist to
appeal the sentence of an 18-year-old woman convicted of child
abuse and ordered to practice birth control for the remainder of
her child-bearing years, her defense attorney said Thursday.
   Also Thursday, Debra Ann Forster's mother said she understood
the judge's decision ``to an extent'' but hoped the birth-control
requirement could be dropped eventually.
   Robert Billar, a Maricopa County deputy public defender, said he
will recommend that his office appeal the Ms. Forster's sentence,
including ``obviously the provisions for mandatory birth control.''
   Possible grounds include ``constitutional rights to privacy,
religion and so forth,'' he said. Ms. Forster is Roman Catholic;
the church opposes artificial birth control.
   On Tuesday, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge sentenced Ms.
Forster to lifetime probation, with the provisions that she remain
on birth control during her child-bearing years and not see any of
her three children, one of whom was born in jail.
   She had pleaded guilty in April to two counts of felony child
abuse for leaving her two young sons alone in an apartment during a
hot-weather spell, without food or water, for three days last May.
She could have received 30 years in prison.
   Ms. Forster's two boys, 18-month-old William and 6-month-old
Scott, were hospitalized eight days for malnutrition, lesions
caused by a rash and dehydration. Scott was close to death from
dehydration when he was found by Ms. Forster's estranged husband,
police said.
   Ms. Forster told Judge Lindsay Ellis Budzyn she left the
children because she could not cope with the pressures of taking
care of them alone.
   Budzyn said Wednesday the birth-control requirement was the only
way she could make sure the woman would not abuse other children.
   Society offers little or no support to help those who are under
stress so that they do not abuse their children, the judge said.
``We don't have a lot of help out there for people,'' she said.
   Budzyn indicated that Ms. Forster's probation terms, like those
of all cases, could be modified in the future if requested by Ms.
Forster or her probation officer.
   Mary Jane Golotte, Ms. Forster's mother, said Thursday from
Amelia, La., she understood the sentence ``to an extent'' and that
the birth-control requirement is reasonable for the next several
years while the daughter gets life ``back together.''
   However, Ms. Golotte also said she hoped the requirement could
be dropped eventually.
   ``Later, down the road, people do change, and what if she
decides to get married and start her life all over again? What is
there for her to look forward to?''' the mother asked.
   Ms. Golotte also said she disagreed with Budzyn's statement that
Ms. Forster's case was an example of children having children.
   ``I think a lot of it has to do with drugs,'' she said. ``I
don't think it was because Debra Ann was not mature enough to have
children.''
   Ms. Golotte, 33, said that she was 15 when her daughter was born
and that her own mother gave birth to her also at age 15.
   A Catholic church official joined civil liberties advocates in
criticizing the sentence.
   The Rev. Timothy Davern, Phoenix Diocese vice chancellor, said
that he objected to the sentence on the grounds of religious
liberty and what he called its contradictory message.
   Ms. Forster has been sentenced to a lifetime of probation
counseling, he said, but ``the judge seems to be saying that no
amount of counseling could help this person grow to be a whole
person.''
   ``I'm not trying to minimize what she did, but how much does the
average person change between the ages of 20 and 30?,'' Davern said.
   Ms. Forster gave birth to a daughter while in jail awaiting
trial on the child abuse charges. According to court records, a
family friend adopted the daughter, and the sons were being placed
through an adoption agency.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet parliament approved legislation
Thursday making it easier for private cooperatives to compete with
state-run businesses and giving local authorities power to promote
certain goods and services with tax breaks.
   The Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament, made some
rare amendments to the law and held back the tax structure for
further changes. The moves came in a three-day session that ended
Thursday after much debate.
   The Supreme Soviet normally only approves laws put forward by
the ruling Communist Party. Debate over the cooperative law, which
delayed the vote for a day, underscored a greater willingness and
ability to speak out under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of greater openness.
   Officials said that in three months of public debate about the
law before it reached the Supreme Soviet, 42 of its 50 articles had
been amended.
   The amended law, which passed unanimously Thursday as is
traditional, goes into effect July 1.
   ``Local Soviets (governing councils) and other state bodies can
set a preferential tax system on cooperatives and ... members,''
said Alexei Ponomarev, the head of a Supreme Soviet commission that
reported on the cooperative law to the parliament Thursday.
   The law, as initially presented, had given only national
officials the right to give tax breaks.
   The adopted law also guarantees that cooperatives cannot be run
out of business by state-run enterprises. It allows them to conduct
business with foreign companies and receive hard currency as
payment; to own buildings and other property; and to appeal
decisions by authorities not to license a cooperative.
   Cooperatives are owned by the people who work in them and
represent a small sector of the Soviet economy, which is dominated
by state-run ventures.
   The arrangement is permissible under Marxist theory, which
teaches that workers are exploited if they work for anyone other
than the state or themselves.
   A law permitting formation of cooperatives has been adopted
under Gorbachev. Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Tuesday
that 14,000 cooperatives were formed in the first 18 months of the
law and another 6,000 in the past three months.
   Gorbachev has said he is depending on their development to
provide consumer goods and services that the inefficient state-run
economy cannot provide.
   Restaurants are one of the most popular forms of cooperatives
that have opened. Others have formed to make clothing, pump gas,
make home repairs and provide other services.
   In debate Wednesday in the Soviet of Nationalities, one of the
two chambers of parliament, deputy Georgy Tarazevich of Minsk,
Byelorussia, said local authorities should be given the right to
give tax breaks to encourage production of goods and services they
think are necessary.
   ``In my view, it's necessary to transfer to local Soviets the
tax policy regarding cooperatives,'' he said in remarks reprinted
by the government newspaper Izvestia.
   Ponomarev said the overall tax structure also would be reworked,
allowing flexibility depending on ``market conditions as well as
the activity of cooperatives.''
   But he did not say whether the specific tax rates in the law
would be reconsidered.
   Under the law as presented on Tuesday, personal income taxes
would be 27 percent on a monthly income of $1,600 and 53.5 percent
on an income of $3,200. The tax rate eventually reaches 90 percent.
   The average industrial worker in the Soviet Union makes about
$320 a month.
   Officials have said the aim of the progressive tax system is to
encourage the cooperatives to invest in expanding business rather
than paying high salaries to workers.

   A company with ties to the Iran-Contra
scandal and one of its former executives pleaded guilty Thursday to
charges of selling military equipment abroad without U.S.
permission.
   Fourway Industries Inc. of Woodbury, which manufactures military
parts, pleaded guilty to two counts of a 27-count information
before U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson in Trenton.
   Jacobo Farber, who sold his majority interest in the firm in
October 1986, pleaded guilty to five counts of the information.
   In addition, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said the company and
three employees were indicted in San Diego in an alleged conspiracy
to divert weapons parts to Iran.
   By pleading guilty to the New Jersey charges, Forway and Farber
said that from May 1983 to April 1985, the corporation manufactured
and exported military equipment without registering as an exporter
with the State Department, Alito said.
   Both also admitted violating federal law requiring people
exporting military parts on a special U.S. Munitions List to obtain
licenses for each shipment of military parts, Alito said.
   Forway Industries made headlines in March when it was learned
that retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business
partner, Albert Hakim, tried to buy one-third interest in the
company in 1986 with funds allegedly skimmed from the sale of
American weapons to Iran.
   Secord and Hakim face federal charges they conspired to divert
Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contras. They were
indicted in March along with former national security adviser John
M. Poindexter and former White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver North.
   The bid fell through in November 1986 just as news of the
Iranian arms sale broke.
   Forway Industries, which employees 80 people in two red brick
buildings near downtown Woodbury, manufactures and distributes
military spare parts.

   Crown Prince Willem Alexander was
fined $158 for reckless driving after a weekend road accident that
wrecked his car, a spokesman for the royal family said Thursday.
   The 21-year-old heir to the Dutch throne escaped injury in the
Saturday accident in Leiden, where he is studying history at the
university. The prince, who was driving 39 mph in a 30 mph zone,
drove his car into a ditch.
   Leiden is 10 miles north of The Hague.
   The chief prosecutor at the Hague district court imposed the
fine Thursday, the spokesman said. He declined to be identified in
line with Dutch government practice.
   The spokesman said that although the prosecutor's ruling is open
to appeal, Willem Alexander, the eldest son of Dutch Queen Beatrix,
is planning to pay the fine ``without delay.''
   Willem Alexander was passing another car when the road suddenly
narrowed, and he was forced to squeeze into the right lane, police
said.
   The car then swerved into a roadside ditch. The car was declared
a total loss, according to police.

<TEXT>
   The nation's mayors complained to a House
panel on Thursday that local governments face continued delays in
receiving federal monies for anti-drug programs.
   Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Richard Berkley, speaking on behalf of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors, blamed the delays on administrative
problems of state governments as well as the federal government.
   ``Frankly we are frustrated with the bureaucracy and we are
disheartened by the lack of support from the federal government,''
Berkley said in prepared testimony. ``The drug problem is in the
streets, the schools, the playgrounds of our cities. The
hand-to-hand combat is in the cities.''
   Berkley, president of the mayors group, asked the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse to change the law so federal aid could
be sent directly to cities. State agencies now distribute most of
the money after receiving it from the federal government.
   State and local governments are to receive about $456 million
for drug programs in the current budget year, of which $70 million
is for enforcement, $230 million for education and $156 million for
treatment, according to the mayors.
   A Justice Department official acknowledged to the committee that
there had been ``some delay'' by states in preparing and submitting
applications for anti-drug monies in 1987, but he maintained ``all
of those are understandable'' because of the time required to
collect needed data and prepare spending plans.
   ``There is no delay on the part of the federal government,''
said Richard Abell, assistant attorney general in the dpartment's
office of justice programs.
   He said the Justice Department took an average of 37 days to
release monies to a state after it submitted its drug program plan.
   Berkley's remarks reiterated criticisms made last year by the
mayors that federal and state government were not quickly
distributing monies to cities for programs established after a
highly publicized 1986 anti-drug crusade by Congress and the Reagan
administration.
   Berkley also objected to the administration's proposed
elimination of federal aid for drug law enforcement in fiscal year
1989, which starts Oct. 1.
   ``This is not the way to wage a war on anything,'' Berkley said.
   Berkley welcomed Reagan's proposed 1989 increases of $10 million
for treatment and $20 million for drug education.

   A 78-year-old retired farmer will serve
at least 28 months in prison for the shooting death of his wife,
who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a judge ruled Thursday.
   Oscar Carlson, who has said he shot his 71-year-old wife, Agnes,
in February to end her suffering from the disease, will begin
serving his time at the Stillwater state prison immediately.
   Douglas County District Court Judge Paul Ballard gave Carlson a
43-month sentence. With good behavior, Carlson would be eligible
for parole in 28 months.
   Ballard recommended that Carlson later be placed in one of the
state's least restrictive facilities. That decision would be made
by the state commissioner of corrections.
   With good behavior, Carlson would be eligible for parole in 28
months.
   Before the sentencing, Carlson told Ballard that he was ``so
sorry'' for what happened to his wife of 45 years.
   Speaking in a faltering voice and sometimes breaking into tears,
Carlson asked Ballard to place him in a nursing home instead of
sending him to prison.
   ``I hope you will put me in a home, someplace where I can be of
some good to somebody,'' Carlson said.
   Carlson's attorneys had hoped that Carlson, who they said had
never even received a traffic ticket, would not have to serve time
in prison.
   Carlson pleaded guilty several weeks ago to second-degree murder
after Ballard said he would consider a maximum 43-month sentence.
That agreement departs from state sentencing guidelines, which call
for an 18-year sentence for second-degree murder.
   Carlson said in court Thursday during a pre-sentence hearing
that he snapped when he received the news Feb. 28 that his wife had
broken her hip and would have to be hospitalized. The next day, he
took an old pistol to the Crestview Manor Nursing Home in
Evansville where she lived and shot her four times.
   ``I just cracked up. I just couldn't take no more,'' Carlson
said.
   Douglas County Attorney Ann Carrott had opposed the 43-month
sentence. She said that she feels compassion toward Carlson, but
believes sentencing guidelines should be followed.
   She also presented a witness Wednesday who suggested that
Carlson had abused his wife and another who said he had complained
about the high cost of his wife's care prior to her death. However,
the nursing director of the home testified under cross-examination
that an investigation had shown no abuse of Mrs. Carlson.
   Carlson testified last month that his wife asked to be shot.
Carlson said he shot her four times with a .22-caliber pistol and
then sat down to pray and watch her die.
   All three of Carlson's daughters testified last month that they
hoped their father would be shown leniency because of the strain he
was under and his age.

<HEAD>Publicist, Master Of Deception Dead At 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guido Orlando, a publicist who concocted
stunts involving Pope Pius XII to boost hat sales in 1958 and King
Farouk to get a young starlet a movie contract in 1950, has died.
He was 80.
   Orlando died Sunday in a Hollywood hospital following a heart
attack.
   In 1958 he was hired by the Millinery Institute of America to
boost sales. He invented the ``Religious Institute of Research,''
which released a fictional survey that purported to show that 22
million Roman Catholic women throughout the United States went to
church bare-headed every Sunday.
   Through a friend in the Vatican, Orlando managed to obtain a
statement from the pope pointing to the dignity and decorum of hats
in church.
   Sales soared.
   Eight years earlier, Orlando planted stories that the Egyptian
king, known for his lavish lifestyle and romantic inclinations, was
chasing a 16-year-old American girl around Europe.
   Orlando had access to the king's travel schedule so arranged to
have the girl photographed at every city Farouk visited. By the
time the three-continent tour was over, the girl had gotten what
her parents hired Orlando for _ a movie contract.
   A native of Italy, Orlando staged his first hoax in 1925 when he
sent himself a phony telegram offering himself a part in a fake
play so his father would let him leave Wheeling, W.Va., for New
York.
   He met silent screen star Rudolph Valentino at a party and
became his friend, man-in-waiting and eventually his press agent.
   Orlando retired in the early 1970s, turning to work on an
autobiography, said longtime friend and retired journalist Pat
Anderson.
   In a 1972 interview, Orlando said he was not ``really such a bad
guy. I never hurt no one. ... I'm just a dream merchant. I make
people's impossible dreams _ fame, money, the movies _ come true.''
   There were no survivors. Services will be private.

<HEAD>Boy With Heart Defect Dies 1{ Hours After Arriving For Dream
Vacation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The happy characters of Disney often cheered
3-year-old Stephen M. Pritchard Jr. amid the trauma of five
operations, so when he was given a chance for a dream vacation, his
family opted for Disney World.
   But just 90 minutes into the visit Tuesday, before he even could
be photographed with Mickey Mouse, Stephen died in his father's
arms, succumbing to a congenital heart defect.
   His parents knew the defect would take Stephen's life at some
point, and they wanted their son to meet the characters he so
enjoyed.
   ``In a way, I'm glad that it happened now because he was happy
at Disney World,'' said his mother, Lisa Pritchard. ``I wish it
didn't have to happen at all. But it was fast, and he didn't have
any pain, and I'm happy for that.''
   Stephen arrived with his parents at the shimmering Magic Kingdom
in Orlando, Fla., about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday. They had their pictures
taken with Jungle Book characters and even caught a glimpse of
Stephen's favorite _ Mickey.
   The Pritchards said they wanted to photograph their sandy-haired
son with Mickey, but the line was long and they stopped at a magic
shop first. Stephen was lying in a stroller. As his father looked
down, he saw his son pitch forward, the Pritchards said.
   Pritchard quickly pushed the stroller outside the shop to his
wife. Mrs. Pritchard lifted her child into her arms and found that
he was not breathing, the couple said.
   Pritchard took his son back while yelling for oxygen, and then,
he said, Stephen ``just closed his eyes and kind of told me in a
way that he was going to go.''
   The boy was granted his wish to see Disney World by Make-A-Wish
and Give Kids the World, which donated the money for the trip.
   He was due to have breakfast with Mickey and the other Disney
characters Wednesday morning before leaving for home here Friday.
   ``This is the first time we've ever had this happen while a wish
was taking place. It's tough because he didn't get to finish his
wish,'' said Rosemary Ruocchio, chairwoman of the wish granting
committee at Make-A-Wish.
   ``We're all filled with questions like `Maybe if he didn't go .
..,''' she said.

<HEAD>Iranians Attack Tanker; Iraq Claims Iranian Jet Shot Down</HEAD>

   Iranian gunboats attacked and set ablaze
a fully-laden Norwegian-operated tanker Thursday as it was sailing
out of the Persian Gulf, shipping executives said. No casualties
were reported.
   Iraq said its anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iranian F-5
fighter over the battlefield in the Salamcheh sector near Iraq's
southern port of Basra.
   Iran said it sent thousands of volunteers Thursday to the
battlefront after their positions east of Basra fell in a lightning
assault Wednesday.
   Iranians hit the 15,530-ton liquefied petroleum gas carrier
Mundogas Rio at 7:45 p.m. as it sailed out of the Strait of Hormuz
and tried to jam its radio communications, said the shipping
executives, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But the signal for help by the Liberian-flagged tanker, which
carried a shipment of Saudi Arabian oil products, was picked up by
another unidentified commercial ship in the vicinity, the
executives said.
   It was the third attack by the Iranians on neutral shipping
since Washington broadened the duties of the U.S. Navy in the gulf,
allowing warships to interevene in attacks on commercial vessels,
even if they are not sailing under the Stars and Stripes.
   The executives said they were not aware of any U.S. Navy
warships in the area at the time of the attack.
   They said the captain of the stricken vessel reported a small
fire aboard the ship but no casualties among the crew.
   The fire was quickly extinguished and the vessel sailed at full
speed toward the Omani port of Fujairah, outside the Strait of
Hormuz, said the sources.
   Elsewhere, a Baghdad communique said Iraqi warplanes ``scored
effective and accurate hits'' in a raid on the Imam Hassan oilfield
in southwestern Khuzestan province in Iraq's bombing campaign
against Iranian oil lines.
   Iran reported heavy artillery and mortar battles in the
Salamcheh sector, recaptured Wednesday by an estimated 35,000 Iraqi
troops.
   Wednesday's 10-hour battle, Tehran's third major military defeat
in five weeks, underlined a dramatic turnaround in the 7{-year-old
war.
   The Iraqis recaptured the Faw peninsula south of Basra, ending
two years of Iranian occupation, in a two-day April offensive. On
April 18, the U.S. Navy sank an Iranian frigate and several other
craft and disabled a second frigate.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
acknowledged that Iranian forces ``had to retreat from parts of the
area they had captured earlier.''
   It said the Iranians were now in ``new positions'' but gave no
details in one of Tehran's rare declarations of a military setback.
   Tehran Radio, also monitored in Nicosia, said ``large numbers''
of volunteers have been dispatched to the battlefront from 19
cities across Iran by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's government.
   The radio did not specify where the volunteers were headed.
   In Qatar, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon
Walters, said Thursday that Washington and Moscow wanted an
Iran-Iraq cease-fire soon, the Qatar News Agency reported.
   The agency quoted Walters as saying the United States was
seeking a new U.N. resolution to enforce the Security Council's
Resolution 598 passed July 20, which called for a cease-fire.
   Walters was in Qatar as part of a Middle Eastern tour.

<TEXT>
   Fishers threatened Thursday to end a
weeklong truce in the Great Anglers' Strike after they spotted
government inspectors checking for fishing licenses.
   Fishers and boatmen said they would renew a boycott of Irish
lakes and rivers Friday to protest the new law requiring anglers to
buy licenses for the first time.
   After the law was announced in April, angling clubs declared
their waters off-limits to fishing. Hotels told guests to stay
away, and fishing stores refused to sell licenses.
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of Tuam, Joseph Cassidy, announced
he had negotiated a deal with the government that prevented the law
from being implemented until further talks.
   Fishers said the appearance of the two inspectors in western
Ireland betrayed the terms of the deal.
   Michael Ryan, secretary of the Federation of Boatmen, which
represents lake fishing boats, said the boycott would resume Friday.
   ``The only talking we will do is through Archbishop Cassidy
directly to the government,'' Ryan said.
   The licenses cost from $15.60 to $26.50, depending on the type
of fish sought.
   Charles Sinnott, chairman of Ireland's Western Regional Tourism
Organization, said more protests could harm western Ireland's $60
million dollar tourism industry.

<HEAD>Autos, Textiles Free-Trade Agreement Losers, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. auto and textile industries would be
losers in barrier-free trade between the United States and Canada,
while industrial machinery, electronics and energy-intensive
businesses would be winners, a private study concluded Thursday.
   The study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, issued as
congressional committees considered whether to recommend approval
of a free-trade treaty between the two countries, said the
agreement broke new ground in easing trade barriers but failed to
eliminate some long-standing trade problems.
   If approved, the agreement ``probably will increase bilateral
trade, particularly between Canada and the Northeast-Midwest
region,'' the study said. ``However, the impact of the proposed
agreement likely would be uneven, with some industries gaining and
others losing.
   ``While the agreement would provide freer trade, its overall
impact on the balance of trade remains uncertain,'' said the
institute, which is a nonpartisan research group established at the
behest of members of Congress to serve senators and representatives
of 18 northeastern and midwestern states.
   The U.S. automotive industry would suffer because the agreement
would retain through 1996 Canadian programs giving breaks on duties
to third-country manufacturers.
   That provision would enable Canadian parts suppliers to build
long-term ties with foreign-owned auto manufacturers, and ``the
program's distortive trade and investment effects would remain in
effect long after these duty remissions schemes were terminated,''
the study said.
   The treaty's requirement that at least half the content of any
auto crossing the border duty-free be North American is not
stringent enough to prevent the purchase of engines, drive trains
and vehicle electronics from third countries, the study said.
   The proposed 10-year phaseout of Canada's 9.2 percent tariff on
automotive goods would discriminate against U.S. makers while
giving their Canadian counterparts duty-free access to U.S.
markets, the study said.
   Canadian tariffs on textiles, which range from 17.5 percent to
25.5 percent, would remain higher than U.S. duties throughout a
10-year phaseout period, ``maintaining a more restrictive barrier
for U.S. producers selling in the Canadian market,'' the study said.
   The agreement would give Canadian textile makers a 56 million
yard quota for duty-free treatment of apparel made from imported
fabric, double last year's shipments to the United States, while
U.S. manufacturers could ship only 11.5 million yards, the amount
of last year's exports to Canada, the study said.
   That lower level for the United States ``would limit
opportunities for U.S. producers to penetrate the Canadian
market,'' the study said.
   The free-trade agreement, by eliminating over five years tariffs
on most industrial machinery produced for shipment to Canada, would
allow exports of such products to become a leading growth sector in
the region, the report said.
   Canada is the largest market for U.S. electronics exports.
Immediate removal of tariffs on data processing equipment and
telephone sets and gradual elimination of tariffs on
telecommunications equipment would increase U.S. electronics
exports further, the study said.
   Chemical processors, fertilizer manufacturers, food processors,
metal casting plants and pulp, paper and lumber mills would gain
greater reliability in their supply of low-cost Canadian
hydroelectric power and natural gas through provisions of the
agreement preventing new quotas, taxes or price requirements, the
study said.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says It Will Withdraw From Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam announced Thursday it will
withdraw 50,000 soldiers from Cambodia beginning next month and
will complete the pullout from its Southeast Asian neighbor in 1990.
   The development came in advance of Sunday's start of the Moscow
summit, at which President Reagan said he would ask Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to encourage the Vietnamese to resolve the
Cambodian conflict.
   From Hanoi, Kyodo News Service quoted Vietnam's defense and
foreign affairs ministries as saying the pullout would cut the
number of troops in half, or to about 50,000.
   According to American estimates, the move would leave 70,000 to
75,000 of Hanoi's forces battling guerrillas in Cambodia.
   The withdrawal, by land and sea routes, is to take place between
June and December.
   Communiques from the defense ministries of Vietnam and Cambodia
said the two governments had agreed the remaining Vietnamese troops
would be placed under the command of the Phnom Penh government.
   The announcements, monitored in Bangkok, were carried by radio
Hanoi and the official Cambodian news agency SPK.
   The Soviet-armed Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978,
overthrowing the regime of the Khmer Rouge and setting up a
pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh. They are fighting guerrillas
backed by China, non-communist Southeast Asian countries and the
United States.
   The 50,000 or more guerrillas, including the Khmer Rouge, are
grouped in a coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former
head of state.
   In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Igor A. Rogachev said
Vietnam's planned withdrawal could improve relations between the
Soviet Union and China and indicates ``a political decision can be
reached'' in the conflict.
   ``We think this opens a direct avenue for the speedy solution to
the problems around Kampuchea (Cambodia) and for turning it into a
zone of peace,'' Rogachev said at a press conference.
   He noted the withdrawal will eliminate two of the three issues
considered obstacles by the Chinese in normalizing relations
between the Soviet Union and China.
   The Chinese have said relations will improve only when the
Soviets withdraw from Afghanistan, a process begun May 15; the
Vietnamese end their occupation of Cambodia; and the Soviets agree
to reduce troops along the Sino-Soviet border.
   The Cambodian news agency said that over the past nine years,
the Phnom Penh government ``has gradually undertaken the defense
work by itself, thus creating the conditions for six annual
withdrawals of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Kampuchea
(Cambodia).
   ``This time, the command of the Vietnamese volunteer army in
Kampuchea will also be pulled out ... and the remaining Vietnamese
troops in Kampuchea are to be placed under the command of the
People's Republic of Kampuchea until their complete withdrawal in
1990.''
   In Tokyo, the official Radio Hanoi, monitored by Radio Press,
quoted Vietnam's Foreign Ministry as announcing that outsiders
would be allowed to watch the pullout.
   This year's partial withdrawal would be by far the largest of
the six that Vietnam claims to have made since 1982. The United
States says the only genuine withdrawal occurred last November,
when 20,000 troops went home.
   Although pledging to completely withdraw by 1990, Vietnam has
warned it will take action if Khmer Rouge guerrillas try to retake
power.
   In Bangkok, a spokesman for Sihanouk, Roland Eng, said he
welcomed the announced withdrawal but said Vietnam should accept
Sihanouk's proposal for an international peacekeeping force to
verify the pullout and to prevent the Vietnamese and the Khmer
Rouge from returning.
   A senior Western embassy official said Vietnam was able to
withdraw forces last November because of the low level of military
activity in Cambodia in the past year.
   The strategy of the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful of the
guerrilla groups, has been to gain control of the villages and
avoid direct clashes with the Vietnamese, apparently to preserve
its forces for the 1990 withdrawal, he said.
   He said the Vietnamese were moving into the interior, leaving
the Phnom Penh forces to guard the Thai border area, the
traditional zone of fighting.

   The armed forces continued to slash their
active-duty strength in April to accomodate budget cuts, paring
more than 28,500 positions from the ranks in one month, the
Pentagon reported Thursday.
   As of April 30, the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps had
2,113,202 men and women on active duty, down 28,555 from the
2,141,757 on March 31 and 44,960 below the April 30, 1987, total.
   The Air Force had 581,861 people on active duty at the end of
April, down 12,799 compared with March 31. The Army listed 759,679
personnel on April 30, down 8,532 over the month.
   The Navy reported a decline of 4,065 men and women in April,
with 577,694 on its roster at the end of the month. And the Marine
Corps reported 193,968 on active duty, down 3,159 from March.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has ordered a cut of almost
36,000 positions from the active-strength totals reported at the
end of fiscal 1987 last Sept. 30. The cuts are to be completed and
the services stabilized at the new levels by the start of fiscal
1989 on Oct. 1.
   Carlucci has told Congress he would rather maintain a smaller
force that is properly equipped and ready to fight than a larger,
but ``hollow,'' force.

   Kevin Tucker, an ex-Secret Service agent who
once guarded President Kennedy's family, quit Thursday as head of
the police department after a 2{-year tenure that restored morale
to a force laced with corruption and reeling from the MOVE
catastrophe.
   ``It was a high honor and privilege to serve this city,''
Tucker, 47, said at a news conference. His resignation takes effect
June 10.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode praised Tucker for bringing ``integrity
and pride to a department in crisis.''
   Tucker said he wants to spend more time with his wife and
children living in nearby Medford Lakes, N.J. He has been living in
Philadelphia, as is required under home rule charter.
   ``I don't want to go into the specifics of my personal reasons,
but I have a lease that is expiring and I have been wanting to
spend more time with my kids,'' Tucker said. ``One of my
disappointments was being away from my family.''
   Tucker indicated that he will take a little time before taking
on an undisclosed job in Philadelphia's private sector.
   ``I leave with a very good feeling for this city, and I look
forward to being part of this city as a citizen,'' he said before
the news conference.
   Tucker took over a morale-shattered department, reeling from
extortion convictions of 34 people, including a deputy
commissioner, in January 1986. Seven months earlier was the
confrontation with the radical group MOVE, in which police dropped
a bomb that killed 11 people and destroyed 61 houses.
   The police commissioner's job was vacated by Gregore Sambor, who
was in charge during the MOVE siege and the federal investigations
that led to extortion charges against members of the force.
   When Tucker took over, he was the first outsider to head the
6,700-member force in more than 60 years. He told Goode then he
didn't plan to make it a lifetime career and only wanted to instill
pride in the police force in the nation's fifth-largest city.
   During his tenure, he even earned the respect of the Fraternal
Order of Police, who often opposed his clean-the-house methods that
included shakeups of personnel, drug examinations and lie detector
tests.
   FOP President Robert Hurst blamed the City Council and mayor for
Tucker's resignation, alleging that failure to provide money to
hire more officers and pay for needed reforms had soured him.
   ``They've devastated and ruined the department, and as a result
the only shining star in the Goode administration is walking out on
them. He is a visionary. It is demoralizing to lose him,'' Hurst
said.
   Tucker, who was a police officer in Rahway, N.J., before joining
the Secret Service in 1965, spent four years traveling around the
world providing security for John F. Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline,
and their two children. He was agent in charge of the Philadelphia
office before resigning in May 1985 for a job in private business.
   Goode said he would appoint a successor from within the
department, hopefully by the time Tucker leaves.
   Among the leading candidates were two deputy commissioners,
Robert Armstrong and Willie Williams, who were with Tucker when he
announced his resignation.
   Armstrong, the department's No. 2 man, declined to be drawn into
a discussion of a successor except to say ``the choice is going to
be competitive and I am proud to be part of the process.''
   All Williams would say was ``there is a cadre of good men in the
department who are capable of taking over the job.''
   If appointed, Williams, 44, a member of the force since 1964 who
was made a deputy commissioner by Tucker, would be Philadelphia's
first black police commissioner.
   ``The decision will be made by the mayor, and I think he has a
very difficult decision because of the good talent of people within
this organization,'' Tucker said.
   Gerald Caplan, who headed a task force that studied the
department for a year, said Tucker ``got worn down'' trying to
improve the department.
   ``None of it came easy,'' Caplan said. ``He not only had to
educate the department, but develop a constituency within the city
government, something that cost him an enormous emount of energy.''

   Mongolia has signed an agreement with the U.S.
International Research and Exchanges Board to begin an exchange of
scholars, a board spokesman announced Thursday.
   The spokesman, George Eager, said the agreement was signed
Monday in New York by Stanley Katz, head of the American Council of
Learned Societies, which oversees IREX, and Namsrain Sodnom,
president of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences.
   In a statement, Katz noted that ``remote Mongolia has long been
inaccessible to American specialists except for brief visits to
congresses on Mongol culture and history.''
   ``The new arrangement will make it possible for American
Mongolists and specialists on inner Asia to settle in for semester
or yearlong stays in order to tap the unexplored riches of
Mongolian archive and manuscript collections,'' he said.
   The agreement will provide for the exchange of up to 10 scholars
per year, beginning in 1989.
   IREX also administers academic exchange programs with the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.

   The value of U.S. agricultural exports is
expected to reach a four-year high of $33.5 billion this fiscal
year, up from $27.9 billion in 1986-87, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   Actual quantities of shipments were forecast at 145.5 million
metric tons, up from 129.2 million tons last year.
   Export values dropped to a decade low of $26.3 billion two years
ago but improved slightly to $27.9 billion in 1986-87. The tonnage
of shipments dropped to 109.5 million tons in 1985-86 before
recovering in 1986-87.
   Despite this year's gains, the current estimates are still far
below the record of $43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons
established in 1980-81 before world economic conditions, high
interest rates, foreign competition, a rising value of the U.S.
dollar and other factors triggered the slide.
   The new forecast also was up by $1 billion and 3 million tons
from USDA's previous estimate on Feb. 25.
   Officials attributed the boost to a growth in animal and
horticultural products and soybeans. The boost in tonnage
``reflects improved prospects for wheat, feed ingredients and
soybeans,'' the report said.
   The value of animal products was boosted $600 million from the
February forecast to a record of $5.6 billion this year, due to
``stronger-than-expected demand for hides, red meats and animal
fats,'' the report said.
   ``Most of the increase in volume stems from larger grain exports
as the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and tighter competitor
supplies boost the U.S. share of world markets,'' the report said.
``Also, higher prices are expected for grains, oilseeds and
cotton.''
   Under the EEP arrangement, selected countries _ including the
Soviet Union and China _ have been getting wheat and other
designated commodities at prices subsidized by the U.S. government.
   Imports of agricultural products this fiscal year were forecast
at a record $21 billion, up $500 million from the February
estimate. Last year's imports dropped slightly to $20.6 billion
from $20.9 billion in 1985-86, the previous high mark.
   But as a result of export values climbing more rapidly, the U.S.
agricultural trade balance _ the difference between exports and
imports _ is expected to rise sharply to $12.5 billion from $7.3
billion last year.
   However, the 1987-88 balance would still be far less than the
$19.1 billion edge U.S. farm exports had over imports in 1983-84.

<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iowa National Guard medical unit's
training trip to Panama has been canceled, but an officer denied
political developments there were the reason.
   ``From what I can tell, the mission just wasn't there,'' said
Lt. Col. Tim Brown. ``There has to be things for the soldiers to do
when they arrive, medical support missions, those kinds of things.
There just wasn't a mission that had enough things for them to do,
I guess.''
   The training exercise was scrapped after a Guard team had looked
at the area, he said. Though Guard officials were monitoring the
Panamanian situation, Brown said he doubted it was a factor.
   He said the decision against the trip was made earlier this
month before the United States broke off negotiations with
Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega for him to step
down.
   The Iowa City unit's physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other
medical personnel had been scheduled to work Aug. 4-18 in support
of the staff at the Gorgas Army Hospital, an American military
facility in Panama.
   Because of the change in plans, most of the unit's 156 members
will spend that period at Fort McCoy, Wis., said Maj. Paul Schmid,
executive officer of the 109th Medical Battalion. Another 34 will
be assigned to duties in Guatemala.
   In Guatemala, the Iowa physicians, dentists, paramedics, dental
technicians and other health personnel will work with medical
forces from that country.
   Brown said the assistance had been requested by the Guatemalan
government. The Iowa National Guard will be the first unit to train
in Guatemala, he said.

<TEXT>
   A decision by the Agriculture Department to
loosen up acreage controls on 1989 wheat production ``indicates the
United States intends to be a grain seller, not a grain storer,''
the head of the National Association of Wheat Growers said Thursday.
   Frank Johannsen, a wheat farmer from Bayard, Neb., referred to a
USDA announcement on Wednesday that producers would be required to
idle no more than 10 percent of their wheat base acreage to qualify
for 1989 program benefits. The acreage set-aside was 27.5 percent
for 1988.
   Johannsen said the smaller land-idling requirement ``requires a
continuing federal commitment'' to operate the Export Enchancement
Program, or EEP, which has helped reduce surplus U.S. wheat
stockpiles.
   Under EEP, selected foreign countries _ including the Soviet
Union and China _ have been able to buy huge quantities of wheat at
subsidized prices.
   ``We intend to work closely with USDA and the Congress to see
that existing export assistance programs are used effectively and
that the past over-supply of wheat not be allowed to reoccur,'' he
said in statement released by the association's Washington office.
   ``For 50 years _ and often to its detriment _ the United States
has held virtually all the world's surplus grain,'' Johannsen
added. ``With the 1989 wheat program, we shift that burden to our
competitors.''

Counseling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of 23 senators asked the
Reagan administration Thursday to drop efforts to restrict
counseling services at family planning clinics in light of three
court injunctions against the policy.
   ``We urge you to abandon efforts to implement these
unconstitutional regulations,'' Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and 22
colleagues said in the letter to Health and Human Services
Secretary Otis R. Bowen.
   The administration has said its regulations were designed to
strengthen the wall between federally funded family planning
services, primarily aimed at low-income women, and abortion
services, which the government does not subsidize.
   Among other things, doctors and counselors at clinics receiving
federal grants would not be able to tell a pregnant woman that
abortion was one of her options.
   Federal judges in Massachusetts, New York and the District of
Columbia issued injunctions against the regulations.
   The senators said recent statements indicate the administration
plans to determine which family planning grant recipients are not
affected by the injunctions and proceed with implementation and
enforcement ``for these few and unfortunate programs.''
   The nine Republicans and 14 Democrats said they were troubled by
a policy that ``continues to press illegal, unconstitutional and
medically unethical rules onto providers of such an important
service.''
   Th net result of pursuing the policy will be costly litigation
and reduced services for the poor, they said.
   ``We respectfully urge you to put an end to this dispute and
formally withdraw the regulations in question,'' the senators said.
   In addition to Chafee, those signing the letter were: Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.; Daniel Evans, R-Wash.; Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; Paul
Simon, D-Ill.; Robert Stafford, R-Vt.; Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.;
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Bob

<TEXT>
   An AIDS testing and counseling bill in the
works for more than a year cleared its first congressional panel
Thursday, stripped of a controversial provision outlawing
discrimination against victims of the fatal disease.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote by the House Energy and
Commerce health subcommittee, authorizes $400 million next year and
each of the following two years for new and expanded testing
programs run by states, localities and private groups.
   Testing would have to be voluntary and accompanied by
counseling. Anonymous testing and use of pseudonyms would have to
be permitted to the extent possible under state laws. Health
professionals or others who violated confidentiality standards
outlined in the bill, intentionally or negligently, could be fined
up to $10,000 for each offense.
   The measure is to be taken up by the full Energy and Commerce
Committee next month, after which it goes to the House floor.
   A similar bill is pending in a Senate committee.
   House members and their staffs haggled over the AIDS testing
bill for six months before it was introduced last July, and
negotiations continued right up until Thursday's vote. The key
compromise was dropping the anti-discrimination section before
considering the bill in subcommittee.
   ``Unfortunately, that policy is caught up in such controversy
that we will not be able to pursue it at this time,'' subcommittee
chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said Monday when the panel began
work on the bill.
   Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, said the bill is worthwhile even without the
discrimination ban ``because of the confidentiality provisions and
because it mandates a minimum level of counseling'' including
information on AIDS and how to avoid it.
   Waxman said federal laws and policies already make it clear that
discrimination by government employers and contractors is
unacceptable and he said many private employers ``already are
acting responsibly.''
   But Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he would fight to restore the
discrimination ban this year and, if he has to, in the next
Congress.
   ``There is a real question about the private sector,'' Wyden
said. He also contended that ``many Americans will be reluctant to
come forward for voluntary testing if they are then open to blatant
discrimination on the basis of the results.''
   The subcommittee considered dozens of amendments in the course
of three days of work this week on the bill. The panel approved
mandatory testing of people convicted of intravenous drug use,
prostitution or a crime related to sexual assault and made it a
crime for a person to contribute to a blood bank or have sexual
relations if he knows he has AIDS or carries the AIDS virus.
   Amendments requiring testing of marriage license applicants and
people admitted to hospitals were rejected. The subcommittee also
refused to require that public health authorities be given the
names, addresses and phone numbers of people who don't have AIDS
but test positive for the virus that causes it.
   In a final compromise Thursday, the subcommittee agreed to a
section saying money under the bill cannot be used for counseling
``that promotes or encourages, directly, homosexual or unsafe
heterosexual activity or intravenous substance abuse.'' The
amendment also says counselors must supply ``the most current
scientific knowledge available ... provided that any informational
materials used are not obscene.''
   The amendment arose from an educational comic book and videotape
produced by the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, which receives
federal money. Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., said the comic
book ``depicts two males in every state of undress and sexual
contact the mind can conjure.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is transmitted
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring. There is no cure for the disease, which damages the
body's immune system.

<TEXT>
   Sunflowerseed oil exports would be subsidized
under proposed procedures to carry out a new program ordered by
Congress, the Agriculture Department announced Thursday.
   The plan would provide bonuses, or subsidies, to U.S. exporters
so they can charge less to foreign customers, thereby boosting
sunflowerseed oil exports.
   Under the proposal for the Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program,
or SOAP, exporters could collect subsidies in the form of surplus
sunflowerseed oil, said Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg.
   The program was authorized in a 1988 appropriations act, which
directed USDA to buy $10 million worth of sunflowerseed oil ``to
facilitate additional export sales of sunflowerseed oil,''
Goldberg's announcement said.
   Public comments on the SOAP plan can be sent to: General Sales
Manager, Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA, Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Republicans Stage Lockout As Senate Approves Tax Increases</HEAD>

   A $110 million tax increase is on its way to
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' desk, a package that state
Republicans hope will embarrass Dukakis as he campaigns for
president on a reputation as a tax-cutter.
   ``He's projecting himself as a tough law-and-order governor, as
a hands-on manager and as a budget-balancer. He's none of those,''
Sen. David Locke, a state co-chairman for Republican George Bush,
said Thursday.
   The tax package includes $70 million to couple the state income
tax with the federal code and $40 million from a tobacco sales tax.
Dukakis approves the former but has sent mixed signals on the
latter.
   The cigarette tax passed the state Senate on Wednesday following
a bizarre lock-out protest by Republican legislators. It is
expected to land on Dukakis' desk after a rubber-stamp final vote
by both houses.
   The governor's administration and finance secretary, Frank
Keefe, supports the measure but Dukakis aides hastily said that
Keefe was speaking for himself.
   Dukakis, before leaving to campaign in California, insisted that
the state can balance its books without the tax proposal.
   ``The governor's position has been, `I'll take a look at it, I'm
not supporting it,''' Dukakis' chief secretary, Hale Champion, said
Thursday.
   Asked about the cigarette tax, Dukakis told reporters Thursday,
``They'll be working this out, and when the budget gets to
conference we'll sit down and decide if we need additional
revenue.''
   In an unusual legislative tactic, six Senate Republicans failed
to return to the Senate chamber Wednesday evening. They locked
themselves in a Senate office and either took the phones off the
hook or ignored calls from Senate leaders.
   Meanwhile, Senate Democrats, in a voice vote, quickly passed the
cigarette tax as well as the $70 million income tax coupling bill.
   The Republicans said they were hoping to delay action on the tax
increase proposals while at the same time trying _ and succeeding _
to draw media attention to the tax bills.
   ``I would not be surprised if it were almost a Machiavellian
plot (by Democrats) to put tax bills on his desk and have him veto
them,'' Locke said. ``He is desperately trying to assume the mantle
of a tax-cutter.''
   Fellow GOP Sen. Paul Cellucci sees the cigarette tax as a
relatively minor issue compared to the state's budget woes.
Lower-than-expected state revenues have forced several downward
revisions in the $12 billion budget plan Dukakis filed in January.
   ``Why is the budget he filed at least half a billion dollars out
of balance, if not more?'' Cellucci said. ``The answer is a simple
one: there's been no discipline in spending.''
   During floor debate, Locke called the proposal ``a premonition
of what lies ahead for America.''
   ``When they elect the Duke, this is exactly what you are going
to get _ when they run out of dough, they raise taxes,'' he said.
   Senate President William Bulger, a Boston Democrat who supports
Dukakis, derided the Republican lock-out as a publicity stunt.
   ``The minority party was well aware of what's been going on,''
Bulger said. ``I'm not sure what constitutes childish behavior on
the part of Republicans. There's no reason for them to have been
gone for so long. ... Republicans know they're not smart. What they
do is look for attention.''

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis pressed his demand Thursday for ``a full
explanation'' of CIA links with Panama's Manuel Noriega and
ridiculed Vice President George Bush's comments on the subject.
   Dukakis, campaigning in advance of California's June 7 primary,
also gave the back of his hand to several of the vice president's
recent drug proposals.
   ``The question is, `Why haven't these been done the past seven
years?' Isn't the vice president in charge of this effort?'' he
asked.
   The Massachusetts governor also said it was ``proper and
appropriate'' that House Speaker Jim Wright pledged his cooperation
with any ethics committee probe into allegations of financial
irregularities.
   Beyond that, Dukakis offered no defense of the Democratic
speaker, but he said Bush should not try to exploit any
difficulties Wright might face.
   ``This administration has very serious problems,'' he said.
``We've got a Justice Department that's a laughing stock and we've
got this Noriega mess on our hands.''
   At a news conference, Dukakis also said, ``I'm going to continue
to insist on a full explanation from the administration about
what's going on'' concerning Noriega.
   ``The vice president was asked a few weeks ago whether we are
paying Noriega. He said, `I can't confirm that or deny that.' He's
not running for press spokesman of the CIA. He's supposed to be
running for president of the United States,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Are there links with the CIA? Who were the people that were
involved in drug-running and profit-skimming? And who was it in
this administration who thought that that made sense?''
   Dukakis made his comments as fresh poll results showed him
leading Jesse Jackson in advance of California's Democratic primary
and running ahead of Bush in the state as well.
   The California Poll said Dukakis has the support of 53 percent
of the state's voters compared to 40 percent for the vice president
among those making a choice.
   The comment about Bush and Noriega came at a news conference
during a day designed to depict the governor as a future-oriented
leader.
   He visited a company-sponsored day care center, and aides later
distributed a prepared statement calling for improved day care
around the country.
   In a speech to Syntex Co. employees, Dukakis also said the
United States needs to redirect some research and development money
away from the military and into civilian use.
   Responding to a question at the news conference, Dukakis
repeated his stance that he's unable to guarantee he won't raise
taxes if he reaches the White House, although he said that would be
his last resort.
   He also declined to say whether he would sign a cigarette tax
increase moving through the Massachusetts Legislature.
   `They'll be working this out, and when the budget gets to
conference we'll sit down and decide if we need additional
revenue,'' he said.

   The Justice Department told the H. J. Heinz
Co. of Pittsburgh and Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc. of San Diego that
it would file suit to block Heinz's attempt to merge the marketers
of two of the country's three leading brands of canned tuna.
   ``The proposed acquistion poses a significant threat to
competition and to the American consumer,'' said Charles F. Rule,
head of the Antitrust Division. ``Canned tuna is one of the most
popular staple foods on the grocery shelf. This merger could result
in major increases in the prices consumers must pay for one of
their favorite foods.''
   Heinz's subsidiary, Star-Kist Foods, Inc., markets several
brands, including Star-Kist, the leading seller. Bumble Bee markets
two, including Bumble Bee, the No. 3 seller. The No. 2 seller is
Chicken of the Sea, a product of Ralston Purina.
   Star-Kist and Bumble Bee account for about 50 percent of the $1
billion tuna market.
   Heinz announced on Feb. 3 that it planned to acquire Bumble Bee
Seafoods, which also produces, distributes and markets salmon,
oysters and Figaro brand cat foods.

<HEAD>Proxmire Gives `Golden Fleece' Award to NOAA for Buying
Helicopters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. William Proxmire on Thursday gave his
``Golden Fleece Award'' for May to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration ``for wasting $1.9 million on two
unneeded helicopters.''
   The Wisconsin Democrat said in a prepared statement that NOAA's
Office of Aircraft Operations circumvented budget processes to
purchase the pair of Bell 212's, but now cannot identify a specific
program to justify them.
   ``OAO got the rotors and the taxpayers got the shaft,'' he said.
   NOAA's office of public affairs said the agency had no immediate
comment on the award.
   Proxmire, who makes the monthly award for ``ridiculous, ironic
or wasteful'' spending, said the aircraft office originally
justified the choppers as a way of improving safety in NOAA's
program in the Arctic.
   He said that the aircraft operations office, which was
established in 1983 to better manage NOAA aircraft use, ``neglected
to mention to Congress that the (Arctic) program's funding was
being phased down.''
   He quoted an unidentified NOAA manager as saying it was highly
uncertain that the program would even continue after 1988.
   ``As a result of these cuts, one of the helicopters logged only
40 hours of flying time last year,'' Proxmire said. ``I doubt that
many of these hours were spent exploring the Arctic continental
shelf, since the helicopter was kept at OAO headquarters in Miami
for the last 20 months.''
   Only one new NOAA program, a porpoise survey in the eastern
tropical Pacific, will need helicopters, but the Bell 212's
``aren't suited for this project,'' according to the senator.
   ``It would be easy to call this a fly-by-night scheme, but even
that would overstate these helicopters' actual usefulness,''
Proxmire said. ``For a purchase that should never have seen the
light, Northern or otherwise, OAO deserves this month's Fleece.''

In November</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of a black coalition said Thursday
``there is a price'' for Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis to win black votes in November.
   A 28-page report released by the coalition called for U.S.
``stringent and comprehensive'' sanctions against South Africa,
recognition of the government of Angola and an end to aid to the
South African-supported group UNITA.
   ``It is the strong feeling throughout the black American
community that on the issues of foreign policy that the objectives,
the recommendations of this report must be thoughtfully responded
to in exchange for black support in November,'' Randall Robinson,
head of the anti-apartheid group TransAfrica, told reporters.
   ``The Democratic Party can lose with our support, (but) they
cannot win without it,'' he said. ``So all those who turned out in
the black community for the primary must turn out for Michael
Dukakis if he has any chance of the White House. There is a price
for that turnout.''
   Throughout the long primary campaign, Dukakis has made few
overtures to black voters in deference to the popularity of Jesse
Jackson.
   In response to the report, Dukakis released a statement that
outlined his support for the primary concerns of the group.
   ``Apartheid is morally repugnant to all those who cherish
freedom and human dignity. South Africa has engaged in terrorist
acts,'' Dukakis said.
   The report was authored and supported by the Congressional Black
Caucus, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social
Change, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, the National Council of Negro Women and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.

<HEAD>Fire Near Air And Space Museum Causes Minor Damage</HEAD>

   A fire broke out Thursday in the restaurant
being built next to the Air and Space Museum, causing minor damage.
   The two-alarm fire, which started just before 3 p.m., sent heavy
smoke into the air but didn't spread to the popular museum where
countless irreplaceable exhibits of aviation and space history are
on display.
   ``Seeing all that smoke coming out of it, it was a frightening
sight,'' said Madeleine Jacobs, a spokeswoman for the Smithsonian
Institution.
   She said, however, the fire wasn't as serious as it appeared and
visitors to the museum were not disturbed.
   The $14.3 million restaurant, a two-story glass structure
supported by white steel tubing, is scheduled to open in September.
   ``Apparently a spark from a welder's torch ignited some paper
that was being used to line the windows,'' said Leo Givs of the
District of Columbia Fire Department. No injuries were reported.
   Jacobs said the blaze caused little structural damage, although
firefighters had to knock holes in the glass walls to vent the
heavy smoke. No damage estimate was available, and officials didn't
know whether the fire would delay the restaurant's opening.

   The military put its forces on high
alert Thursday following several bombings, peasant marches and the
seizure of the Mexican Embassy by leftist guerrillas.
   President Virgilio Barco was in Portugal but was reported by a
Cabinet minister to be in control of the government.
   Clashes this week between the army and peasants demonstrating
for land reform and nationalization of foreign oil companies have
left 11 people dead and 26 injured, the Defense Ministry said
Thursday.
   In the last three days guerrillas have blown up a bridge on one
of the country's most important highways, dynamited an oil pipeline
and a gas pipeline and destroyed an electricity transmission tower.
   The defense minister, Gen. Rafael Samudio Molina, said in a
communique that he was putting the armed forces on top alert.
   He spoke a few hours after 40 leftist guerrillas wearing black
hoods seized the Mexican Embassy in Bogota to protest water and
electricity shortages in lower-class areas of Bogota.
   The protesters said they belonged to the group M-19, whose
military arm has been active since the 1970s.
   In Mexico City the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday
that the embassy takeover was peaceful and the protesters said they
wanted ``to call attention to questions related to human rights.''
   The protesters apparently were unarmed, it said.
   Three embassy officials and an undetermined number of Colombian
employees were in the building, officials said. The protesters
demanded to talk with Colombia's attorney general, Horacio Serpa,
and the managers of Bogota's departments of electric power and
water.
   Water and electricity have been rationed in many areas of Bogota
during the past two months as the capital goes through its worst
drought in 53 years. The poor have been especially hard hit.
   Barco is being constantly informed of developments in Colombia
and is giving instructions to the minister of government, Cesar
Gaviria, said the minister of communications, Fernando Cepeda, who
was with the president in Lisbon. He spoke in an interview on the
Colombian radio network Caracol.
   In the western city of Cali assailants threw bombs Wednesday
night at the seven-story Cosmocentro department store, causing $17
million in damage, police said. No one claimed responsibility.
   Ten more bombs were found outside other stores and were
deactivated, the police said.
   Four bombs exploded in Medellin, in northwest Colombia, causing
slight damage to two banks, a government office and and recreation
club, the police said in a communique. A fifth bomb was
deactivated, the police said.
   The National Liberation Army guerrilla group, Colombia's most
active rebel group, claimed responsibility for the Medellin
bombings.
   In the central Colombian city of Barrancabermeja, James Cardona,
leader of a petroleum workers' union, was slain Wednesday night,
police said. No one claimed responsibility for the killing.
   Unionized workers at the refinery run by the state oil company
Ecopetrol called a 48-hour strike to protest the slaying.
   Right-wing death squads have killed more than 800 people in the
last three years, including union leaders, leftist political
workers and people believed to be guerrilla sympathizers.
   Thousands of peasants took part in protest marches in half a
dozen northern towns Thursday, said Caracol and the Bogota radio
station RCN. The Defense Ministry claims leftist guerrillas have
organized the protest marches which began Monday.
   Nine peasants and two soldiers have been killed in gunfire
during the marches, and 24 peasants and two soldiers have been
wounded, the Defense Ministry said.
   Broadcast and newspaper reports have said between 17,000 and
30,000 peasants have taken part in the demonstrations.
   The military wing of M-19, or the April 19 Movement, seized the
Dominican Republic's Embassy in 1980 and held 16 ambassadors
hostage there for two months. It also stormed Colombia's Palace of
Justice in Bogota in 1986. Ninety-five people, including 11 Supreme
Court justices, were killed.
   The April 19 Movement takes its name from a 1970 presidential
election which critics said was fraudulent.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson said Thursday that the upcoming superpower summit is a step
in the right direction, but that other nations should be included
in future meetings.
   ``When Reagan and Gorbachev meet in the Soviet Union, they
represent 500 million people, one-eighth of the human race.
Seven-eighths will be locked out of the meeting ... that has to
change,'' Jackson said.
   Still, he said, holding the summit ``is the right thing to do _
to talk it out and not shoot it out. ...our future is to choose
negotiation over confrontation, the human race over the arms race.''
   Jackson made his remarks at a rally with about 1,000 students at
racially mixed Independence High School in San Jose, 50 miles south
of San Francisco.
   He was concluding a 10-day campaign tour of California, where
polls suggest he is running far behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis for the June 7 primary.
   In his campus rally, Jackson said he believed he was having an
impact on Dukakis' views on South Africa. Jackson has been urging
that South Africa be designated a terrorist state, and has been
trying to bring Dukakis around to that view.
   Dukakis says he wouldn't rule it out, but also says he believes
economic sanctions would be a more effective first step.
   ``He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' Jackson said. He said
Dukakis is following his lead on the matter, as well as on drug
issues.
   Jackson again criticized the Reagan administration for ``the
disgraceful practice of negotiating with drug dealers, which
discredits our government and is beneath our dignity.'' He repeated
his familiar anti-drug message to the students.
   ``I challenge you today. Let's stop drugs, crack, heroin,
cocaine, PCP. Drugs are dream-busters. Drugs destroy your mind,
your body, your character, your good judgment... As president, I
can stop the supply of drugs. You must stop the demand for drugs,''
Jackson said.

   Dayton Duncan, a former deputy press secretary to
1984 Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, was named
Thursday as national press secretary for Democratic front-runner
Michael Dukakis.
   Duncan, 38, of Roxbury, N.H., will join the Dukakis campaign in
mid-June, according to a campaign statement. The appointment had
been rumored for several weeks and Duncan traveled with the
Massachusetts governor last week in what campaign aides said was a
trial run.
   Mark Gearan, the current national press secretary, will become
chief press secretary at the campaign's Boston headquarters,
overseeing the expansion of the press staff for the expected fall
campaign against Vice President George Bush.
   Both Gearan and Duncan will report to campaign communications
director Leslie Dach. Duncan will do the bulk of the traveling with
Dukakis in the fall campaign, campaign aides said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Thursday it had 100,300
soldiers in Afghanistan when the withdrawal began May 15. It was
the first count the Kremlin had given in the eight years since it
joined the Afghan civil war.
   The number provided by Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, chief of
the general staff and a first deputy defense minister, was nearly
15,000 below Western intelligence estimates.
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
replaced one Communist government with another and stayed to fight
Moslem guerrillas.
   Akhromeyev gave the figure at a news conference the day after
Gen. Alexei D. Lizichev, another ranking Defense Ministry official,
provided the first Soviet casualty count: 13,310 soldiers killed,
35,478 wounded and 311 missing. Lizichev had refused to reveal the
size of the Soviet force.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Thursday large
Soviet convoys were moving at night in northern Afghanistan in an
effort to speed the withdrawal.
   They said a major movement from Kabul north through the Salang
pass began early Wednesday and continued Thursday, but they did not
have the number of soldiers involved.
   Night travel is unusual and risky, particularly in the Shomali
area just north of Kabul, where reports indicated heavy fighting
recently, the diplomats said. The reports said guerrillas had taken
Qarabagh and Bagram, towns about 30 miles north of the capital.
   The diplomats in Islamabad, all of whom spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they had no indications from Kabul that rebel
pressure had impeded Soviet withdrawal.
   When journalists at the news conference asked Gen. Akhromeyev
for the number of soldiers, he replied: ``The contingent in
Afghanistan as of May 15 numbered 100,300.'' He said 9,500 soldiers
had left since the withdrawal began.
   Reports have said about 20,000 would be out by Sunday, when the
U.S.-Soviet summit begins in Moscow. Under the agreement signed
April 14 in Geneva, half the force is to be withdrawn by Aug. 15
and all Soviet soldiers must be gone within nine months.
   Earlier this week, reports from Islamabad quoted diplomats as
saying only two Soviet units totaling about 3,000 soldiers had left
since May 15.
   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator who arranged the accord, said
Thursday in Geneva the agreement is ``slowly falling into place''
and ``we have a feeling that the implementation has started on the
whole in an effective manner.''

<HEAD>EPA Adds More Than 100 Counties, Rural Areas to Bad Air List</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Thursday designated scores of additional counties, generally in
farther-out suburban areas, that must be considered part of urban
areas failing to meet clean air standards.
   If the counties eventually are included in new air pollution
control plans the agency is requiring, it could mean tighter
controls on their industries and possibly auto pollution
inspections if not already in force.
   The designation was made in formal notices to 44 state governors
and the mayor of the District of Columbia. The agency said it was
disapproving air pollution control plans, or revoking previous
approval, for cities and a handful of rural areas that do not meet
air quality standards. The notices said the additional counties
must be considered in new plans.
   States are being given 60 days to submit schedules on which they
will draw up new plans, which can take two years; to fulfill
promises in old plans; to begin new assessments of actual pollution
as opposed to computer estimates; and to add monitors where EPA
says they're needed.
   The ozone non-compliance areas gained 125 counties and the
carbon monoxide areas gained 115.
   Only Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa and
Vermont do not have non-complying areas and thus are not getting
Thursday's letter.
   EPA announced on May 2 that 68 areas fail to meet ozone
standards and 59 do not meet carbon monoxide standards, based on
1985-1987 data. It had warned last November that it would enlarge
planning areas, but the decision just where the expansions would
come was made during the last two months generally based on census
and other economic data.
   The failure of the nation's cities to meet clean air goals has
frustrated politicians and policymakers alike for at least a
decade, and there has been no agreement on what to do about it.
   Congress last December barred the agency from imposing sanctions
until Aug. 31 for failure to draw up acceptable control plans. Thus
it shelved EPA plans to forbid the construction of major new
sources of pollution in 14 areas where it considered control plans
inadequate. It also told EPA to accelerate its annual designation
of non-complying areas this year.
   In the meantime, Congress is considering a wide range of changes
to the Clean Air Act, including provisions to deal with the failure
of the 68 and 59 areas to meet the Dec. 31, 1987, deadline for
attaining the air quality standards. Most provisions would award
more time and require new anti-pollution steps.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told a news conference he was
doing nothing that would pre-empt congressional action, and
``Clearly what I'm doing is not sufficient to deal with the
problem.''
   If Congress fails to act, Thomas said that in the fall he would
begin to carry out a strategy he outlined last November to require
new control measures against carbon monoxide and the precursors of
ozone. Some measures are in the pipeline already, such as draft
regulations to control gasoline evaporation, which helps form ozone.

   The Soviet Union canceled one of
President Reagan's summit sessions next week with General Secretary
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and objected to the makeup of a religious
delegation scheduled to see Reagan, White House officials said
Thursday.
   Presidential spokesmen sought to minimize the last-minute
glitches, which developed as Reagan and his wife Nancy attempted to
overcome jet lag and rest up for the start of the summit in Moscow
Sunday.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the Senate neared pre-summit approval
of the historic treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear
missiles that Reagan and Gorbachev signed at their Washington
summit in December. The Senate voted overwhelmingly to restrict a
future president's power to change the U.S. interpretation of the
treaty, settling the last major issue before floor action on the
document.
   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said the decision to
scrub one of Reagan's five face-to-face meetings with Gorbachev was
``mutual.'' However, chief spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had said
earlier that U.S. officials were seeking an explanation.
   Fitzwater, talking to reporters in this Finnish capital
Thursday, said, ``I regard it as routine.'' A second
Reagan-Gorbachev meeting scheduled for next Monday was canceled by
the Soviets for what the Kremlin cited as ``some internal
function.''
   Fitzwater said the Soviets had ``a scheduling problem'' with one
of the Reagan-Gorbachev sessions, in particular one set for Monday
afternoon.
   ``They needed the time for some internal function,'' he said,
and his office later issued a statement saying the meeting had been
canceled by ``mutual decision.''
   There was no indication whether the cancellation was related in
any way to a Communist Party conference, the first of its kind
since 1941, that is scheduled to open in Moscow after the summit.
   Another problem developed when word reached the presidential
party that the Soviets had questioned the participation of one of
the religious groups scheduled to meet with Reagan at the Danilov
monastery on Monday.
   ``The meeting itself is still on as far as I know,'' Fitzwater
said. He said he did not know which religious group the Soviets
objected to.
   Reagan also plans to meet separately with a group of Jewish
``refuseniks'' who had been unable to obtain exit permits for
Israel. Fitzwater said he was unable to verify a complaint that two
persons had been intercepted by Soviet authorities on their way to
Moscow from Leningrad.
   A White House official, speaking on condition he not be
identified by name, said the administration had been assured that
``everyone that's been invited will attend'' the Monday afternoon
session.
   On the official level, the Soviets have shown no concern over
the meeting planned between Reagan and Soviet refuseniks. At a
press conference to discuss the forthcoming summit, U.S. affairs
expert Georgy A. Arbatov and Communist Party Central Committee
official Nikolai Shishlin both stated that they considered Reagan's
meeting partners his own business.
   But Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky said, ``This
American move is hardly aimed at improving mutual understanding
between the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.''
   As far as the planned Reagan meeting with ``refuseniks'' and
``dissidents'' is concerned, Petrovsky said, it ``looks in a
different light, since the point at issue is an obviously
tendentious selection of the participants.''
   Petrovsky said ``the U.S. president, who will be our guest in
Moscow, is certainly free to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds
interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the
official events.''
   Dozens of refuseniks demonstrating in Moscow Thursday said they
want human rights to figure prominently in the Reagan-Gorbachev
meetings.
   A Leningrad refusenik said in a telephone interview that KGB
secret police has warned him against accepting an invitation to
meet Reagan on Monday.
   Roald ``Alec'' Zelichonok, who has been refused permission to
emigrate for more than 10 years, said he received a letter and
telephone call Tuesday from the U.S. Embassy inviting him to take
part in the meeting with Reagan. Shortly after the embassy phone
call, he said, a KGB officer telephoned.
   ``This officer called and said in light of security measures
around Moscow, my departure for Moscow will not be permitted,''
Zelichonok said by telephone from his Leningrad home.
   Zelichonok, 51, said the officer warned him that if he traveled
to Moscow, ``administrative measures'' carrying possible penalties
of detention, house arrest or up to 15 days in jail would be taken
against him.
   Despite the White House's efforts to smooth over any
differences, the schedule change and rumors that the Soviets were
attempting to restrict access to Reagan contributed a measure of
uncertainty to his fourth summit meeting with Gorbachev.
   The pre-summit jockeying came as the Reagans remained in
seclusion at an official Finnish guesthouse here _ a plush retreat
furnished with an indoor sauna and pool and located in a wooded
residential area.
   In a private, waterside park near the guesthouse, America's
first couple took a 30-minute stroll, ``greeted local citizens''
and Reagan threw stones across the water, a White House statement
said.
   Reagan delivers a pre-summit address on human rights here
Friday, and rests again Saturday before leaving Sunday for the
five-day Moscow summit.
   As he awaited word from the Senate on ratification of the treaty
banning medium-range missiles, Reagan's top arms negotiator, Max
Kampelman, expressed confidence that the superpowers would dispense
with some knotty problems on a more far-reaching pact aimed at
halving their arsenals of strategic missiles.
   Reagan also met briefly with his senior advisers to go over the
final details of the summit schedule _ omitting the second Monday
meeting and lengthening the times of other meetings, the White
House statement said.
   Overall, the president still will spend six hours with
Gorbachev, because the remaining sessions will be expanded,
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater told reporters that Reagan is going over a 3-inch
briefing book and, six months after he started, has finished
Gorbachev's book ``Perestroika,'' on his plans to revitalize his
country's troubled economy.
   The advisers who huddled with Reagan were not identified, but it
appeared most White House officials attempted to follow Reagan's
laid-back approach by enjoying Finland's light breezes and bright
northern sun.
   Fitzwater refused to hold a formal press briefing and tried to
flee reporters who peppered him with questions as he exited his
hotel.
   Secretary of State George Shultz and the president's top arms
control advisers _ Kampelman, Edward Rowney and Paul Nitze _ were
spotted taking a cruise about the city's harbor.
   Unless the Senate acts in time to rush the INF treaty to Reagan
for the formal exchange of ratification documents in Moscow, the
summit has no expectation of major results.
   In an interview Tuesday with a group of West European
jouralists, Reagan left open the possibility of a fifth summit with
Gorbachev before he leaves office in January _ if negotiators can
complete the treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles.
   ``I won't rule it out,'' Reagan said in a text released on
Thursday. ``I won't say it's impossible ... I would hope that we
can iron out the still undecided points before I leave..''

<TEXT>
   In a stopgap measure to deal with a domestic
nursing shortage, the federal government on Thursday granted a
blanket one-year visa extension for thousands of foreign nurses
working in the United States.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service acted following an
appeal last Friday by 42 members of Congress that it grant an
extension.
   In addition to granting a blanket extension _ coverting
five-year visas to six-year visas for foreign nurses _ INS
Commissioner Alan C. Nelson said agency district director ``will
have discretionary authority to grant additional time on a
case-by-case basis.''
   Guidelines for exercising the discretionary authority are being
developed, Nelson said in a statement.
   Meanwhile, he urged hospitals to redouble their efforts to
recruit and retain U.S. nurses and Congress to seek a long-term
solution to a domestic nursing shortage that administrators say
makes it essential for them to employ foreign-born nurses.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the lawmakers who urged
the extension, called the INS response ``an act of compassion.''
   ``There is a desperate shortage of nurses in many parts of the
country,'' Schumer said. ``Even though we all agree that additional
steps must be taken to expand training programs for more American
nurses and improve their pay, we cannot afford to wait at this
point.''
   Schumer pledged to work for legislation to attack the problem.
``The extension doesn't solve the nation's nursing shortage, but it
does buy time,'' he said.
   About 2,000 foreign nurses, 18 percent of the total recruited by
American hospitals, would have been sent home this year had the INS
not extended their visas. Most work in New York or California.
   An estimated 300,000 nursing jobs are unfilled nationwide _ a
vacancy rate that ranges from 10 percent to 20 percent in various
cities.
   The call for visa extensions was backed by nurses unions as a
temporary measure while more American nurses can be recruited and
trained. Union leaders say the profession demands more status and
higher pay _ especially for nurses with long-term experience, who
tend to quit because of burnout and lack of incentives.
   But they say it will take time to accomplish those changes and
that foreign nurses are needed in the meantime.
   Kenneth Raske, head of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said the visa extension ``averted a potential public
health crisis in New York City'' were an estimated 4,000 foreign
nurses work and about one-fifth faced deportation this year.
   Officials in New Jersey estimated about 200 of the 918 foreign
nurses working there would have been subject to deportation this
year without the extension.

   Neighbors fed up with drug users and prostitutes
using a nearby house followed up trashing the place by torching it,
police said.
   About 25 residents on the city's southwest side stormed the
house Tuesday night and routed the occupants with baseball bats and
pipes, engaging some occupants in fist fights. Thursday morning,
the house was set on fire, and authorities suspect the people
simply finished the job they started.
   ``Get Out Now,'' and ``Move'' were spray painted on the front
door when the house was ransacked.
   ``Sure it was a lynch mob,'' one resident said. ``But what are
you going to do? We have to be vigilantes.''
   Police, who learned of the row only after it ended, said no
arrests were made. The fire, in which no one was hurt, likely will
go unprosecuted too, police said.
   Some neighbors said the incidents resulted from years of
frustration that had built up in the once tidy, ethnic neighborhood
of mostly Polish, Lithuanian and Ukrainian families.
   ``The neighborhood has changed gradually over the past 20 years,
but in the last five years it has accelerated,'' said Jack
Vassallo, a senior social planner and developer for the Detroit
Employment and Training Department who has lived in the
neighborhood 55 years. ``There are dope houses, car thefts,
prostitutes, you name it. I really hate to see the neighborhood go
down like this.''
   Neighborhood residents said they had asked for police help
numerous times, but authorities said they had no record of
requests, except for a narcotics complaint late last year.
   ``You can't take the law into your own hands,'' 4th Precinct
Cmdr. Daniel McKane said. ``I don't care how frustrating your
problem is.''

   President P.W. Botha said
Thursday his National Party is the best hope for ending the
nation's deep racial divisions, which critics say the party created
in 40 years of unbroken rule.
   Two bombs exploded at lunchtime on busy streets of Pretoria,
wounding four white women, one of whom lost an arm. Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok blamed the African National Congress, the
main guerrilla group fighting white domination.
   In a speech marking the 40th anniversary of National Party
power, Botha said the party is pursuing gradual reforms that have
broadened democracy while guarding against revolution.
   His Nationalists are best known for the apartheid policy, which
has formalized and strengthened racial segregation since they
gained power in the election of May 26, 1948.
   Botha has pursued limited reform since taking charge in 1978 but
his party's objective remains the preservation of political and
economic control for the 5 million whites. South Africa's 26
million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   On Thursday, Botha said the National Party will never allow
militant anti-apartheid groups to take power ``because we don't
want a dictatorship that restricts the freedom of people.''
   He conceded some mistakes by the party during four decades in
power, but did not name them and said, ``We did much more right
than we did wrong.''
   ``We will succeed just as we succeeded in the past when we
brought great things into being in this country,'' he told his
audience in Parow, just outside Cape Town.
   The bombs exploded within five minutes and two blocks of each
other on busy street corners of the capital. The four women injured
were librarians in their 30s returning to work from lunch, police
and witnesses said.
   Spokesmen at the H.F. Verwoerd Hospital said all the injuries
were caused by the second bomb. In addition to the woman whose arm
was blown off, they reported two had extensive facial burns and the
fourth suffered back injuries.
   About five minutes earlier, a bomb destroyed a parked car but
caused no injuries.
   ``These cowardly and unscrupulous deeds are characteristic of
the desperate attempts being waged by the ANC to practice
terrorism,'' Vlok said.
   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the ANC military commander, Joe
Modise, said: ``Basically, we do have men with bombs, and no one
else carries out this type of operation inside the country.''
   Modise was in Ethiopia for the Organization of African Unity
summit.
   More than 70 bombs have exploded in South Africa since a state
of emergency was declared June 12, 1986, to thwart an uprising in
black townships.
   In a signed article recently in The Sunday Star of Johannesburg,
Botha reflected on how the National Party has shaped South Africa
over four decades.
   ``Human resources are a country's most valuable asset,'' he
wrote. ``That is why, since coming into power, the National Party
has pursued a policy which offers all the Republic of South
Africa's inhabitants maximal quality of life and development
opportunities.''
   Pro-government papers praised the party this week and said it is
best qualified to resolve racial problems.
   ``The troubles we have had in the last two or three years are
nothing compared with the troubles we would have if the government
had not started to dismantle apartheid,'' The Citizen said in an
editorial Tuesday.
   An editorial in The Star held the National Party largely
responsible for the nation's problems and said it had not offered
solutions.
   ``Triumphant the government may feel, yet it is threatened by a
mounting white backlash on its right and a mighty tide of anger
from black South Africa and the outside world on its left,'' The
Star said Thursday.
   At its founding in 1914, the party was intended as a vehicle for
promoting the interests of Afrikaners, descendants of the Dutch,
French and German settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 17th
century.
   After losing to the British in the Boer War of 1899-1902, many
Afrikaners felt dominated culturally and politically by
English-speakers, who generally were richer and better educated.
   Afrikaners now make up 60 percent of the white population and
their economic and educational levels are comparable to those of
English-speaking South Africans.
   Botha's policy of limited reform has induced many
English-speaking South Africans to support the National Party, but
even more pro-apartheid Afrikaners have joined the far-right
Conservative Party, which emerged from the 1987 white election as
the main opposition in Parliament.

   U.S. diplomats held high-level consultations
with Latin American democracies Thursday in search of new ways for
encouraging military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to leave Panama,
a State Department official said.
   Hours after the collapse Wednesday of the U.S. negotiating
effort, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said,
ambassadors in Latin American capitals were ordered to meet with
host-country presidents and foreign ministers on Thursday to
discuss the issue.
   The envoys were asked to tell these governments ``what happened
in detail and to ask for their advice in helping us move forward,''
Abrams told reporters after testifying before a closed-door hearing
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Appearing on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' Thursday night,
Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost indicated that the Central
American democracies will play an increasingly active role in
mediating a settlement in Panama.
   ``I think it's an excellent idea,'' Armacost said, noting that
several Central American countries ``have a tremendous storehouse
of experience in the transition to civilian democratic rule.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced Wednesday the
failure of the negotiation, which was aimed at inducing Noriega to
resign as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces and go into
exile. As part of the proposed deal, U.S. drug-smuggling
indictments against Noriega would have been dropped.
   Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler, rejected the proposal and
Shultz said no further negotiations were planned.
   With Abrams at his side, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
expressed regret over the setback, but many others in Congress
seemed pleased at the outcome.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said, ``A lot of people are not upset
that it fell apart.''
   Kerry said the negotiations hurt U.S. foreign policy ``and also
sent a terrible message with respect to our ability to do something
about the narcotics traffic.''
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan Sosa, who is allied with forces
opposed to Noriega, said ``the United States should hold back and
let other initiatives go forward.''
   Sosa said the Reagan administration negotiated in good faith but
should not have dealt with a terrorist. ``The problem is Noriega is
not an honorable person,'' he said.
   Later, Sosa conferred with State Department officials on the
possibility of a Central American diplomatic effort to resolve the
crisis.
   He said diplomatic contacts have been made since Wednesday with
Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo, who is expected to play a lead
role in any mediation effort by the four Central American
democracies. The three others are Costa Rica, El Salvador and
Honduras.
   The administration has resisted significant involvement in the
Panama issue by other hemispheric governments, but has now shifted
its strategy somewhat after calling a halt to its own initiative.
   Although Noriega has little overt support in Latin America,
hemispheric nations have indicated deep reservations about the
administration's approach to the problem.
   One example of this was a meeting of 26 Latin American countries
two months ago at which a resolution was passed criticizing the
U.S. economic sanctions against Panama.
   In the aftermath of the negotiating failure, U.S. officials said
they attributed the setback to one or a combination of reasons.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said it was possible
that Noriega had no intention of a serious negotiation from the
beginning and was stringing the United States along.
   Another possible explanation, they said, was that Noriega's
allies in the Defense Forces vetoed the proposed deal on the
grounds that the arrangement offered them no guarantees that they
would not be punished by a successor government for their
association with Noriega.
   Finally, the officials said, Noriega may have been negotiating
in good faith all along but when the moment came for a decision, he
was unable to agree to a package that would cost him his job and
send him into temporary exile.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, Assistant Defense Secretary Richard
Armitage said under questioning by the Senate defense
appropriations subcommittee: ``I don't think anyone has totally
precluded use of force (to force Noriega's removal). You always
have that option open.''
   ``But if we can find a way that serves the interest of democracy
in Panama and the interests of the majority of the Panamian people
and our own national security interests without resorting to
shedding of U.S. and Panamian blood, that is the right direction,''
Armitage added.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a strong critic of dealings with
Noriega and the U.S. military's reluctance to get involved, said
the Panamanian leader had ``successfully divided the doves in the
Pentagon from realists in the State Department'' in the use of
force.
   D'Amato criticized the use of a ``third-string secretary of
state'' for negotiations with Noriega and said the administration
should have sent somebody like United Nations Ambassador Vernon
Walters, who is a retired general, or some other three- or
four-star general.
   The main U.S. envoy in the conflict with Panama has been Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Michael Kozak.

   Convinced that another oil crisis lies down
the road, a group of environmentalists, oil companies and state
governors Thursday announced a new attempt to forge solutions
before problems crop up.
   The Denver-based group, the American Energy Assurance Council,
said its members hope to stage a 48-hour simulated oil crisis in
the third week of November, with 100 participants, and persuade one
of the television networks to make an hour-long program out of it.
   ``Polls indicate that national leaders and the American public
are convinced there will be another energy crisis,'' said one of
the organizers, Gov. George A. Sinner of North Dakota. But, he
added, ``Energy policy has fallen off the national agenda,''
especially since crude oil plunged from $28 a barrel to less than
$10 in 1986.
   Charles Ebinger, a staff member at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies and an energy consultant, said, ``The purpose
of the game is to convince everyone that on the basis of the
current impasse, that no one is going to win their agenda.
   ``Environmentalists may see their interests run roughshod over
in another crisis and oil and gas companies may have to accept
price controls again, which isn't in their interests either,''
Ebinger said.
   The rules of the game have not been decided upon. When it is
over, organizers of the group hope to get conflicting interests to
start serious bargaining on a few unspecified topics where
agreement might be possible.
   Crude prices have recovered to about $18, but are still
considered low in the oil patch. Asked why an oil crisis was
likely, Michael Beatty, senior vice president of Coastal Corp., a
Houston-based oil and gas producer, said, ``Low prices are
stimulating consumption and rapidly expanding demand for cheap
overseas oil.''
   Crude and product imports now account for 39 percent of U.S.
consumption, up from 34 percent this time last year.
   John Jenkins, president of the group, said it will try ``to
grapple with conflicting solutions,'' such as the
conservation-at-any-price vision backed by some environmental
organizations and the expand-production-everywhere solution of some
oil companies.
   ``We are working together with people whose views we vehemently
disagree with,'' Beatty said.
   The group includes consevation advocate Amory Lovins and a
consuming-state governor, Thomas Kean of New Jersey.

   A senator Thursday accused the Justice
Department's civil rights chief, William Bradford Reynolds, of
lying to Congress and of rejecting the advice of subordinates who
called for an FBI probe of a Republican Party voter registration
challenge in Louisiana.
   At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, disclosed memos by civil rights division subordinates
urging that the FBI investigate possible criminal violations of the
Voting Rights Act in connection with a GOP voter registration
challenge aimed at predominantly black precincts in Louisiana in
1986.
   In March 1987, Reynolds told the committee that it was the
conclusion of ``everybody who looked at the matter'' from the
division's voting section that ``there was no ... violation of the
Voting Rights Act that would allow us to go in and prosecute.''
   ``You misstated the facts; you lied to the committee,''
Metzenbaum told Reynolds at a Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday.
   ``You state things in half-truths,'' responded Reynolds.
   ``What kind of half-truths, what kind of half-truths?'' yelled
Metzenbaum.
   Reynolds said that another part of the Justice Department, the
criminal division, was consulted on the matter and concluded that
no criminal investigation was warranted.
   Reynolds and a deputy, Jim Turner, insisted that subordinates in
the civil rights division ended up agreeing that no FBI probe was
warranted.
   Since the case involved the Republican Party, ``I wanted to be
darn sure I wasn't going to do something they would question us
about later,'' said Reynolds.
   Metzenbaum released an Oct. 7, 1986, memo by Rebecca Wertz, an
attorney in the voting section, urging the FBI's entry into the
matter. The senator also released another Oct. 7 memo _ this one to
Reynolds from Gerald Jones, chief of the voting section _ which
called for discussions on the appropriateness of having the
criminal section coordinate the investigation.
   In addition, civil rights division investigators wrote a
three-page document that would have been sent by Reynolds to the
FBI director detailing the proposed scope of a criminal probe.
Attached to the three-page document was a note from Jones to Turner
saying, ``As indicated in the earlier briefing papers we sent to
Brad re the Louisiana voter challenge matter, here is the FBI
request we propose to send out.''
   But at the bottom of Wertz' memo, Reynolds said in a handwritten
note:
   ``There is under the circumstances no legitimate reason to
initiate an FBI investigation of the La. activities.'' The note
said that a state court injunction had brought the voter challenge
activity to a halt, that no voters were denied registration rights
and that there was ``no real prospect'' they would be.
   ``On the other hand, there appears to be a concern of possible
harassment, fraud and intimidation of blacks in the upcoming
election,'' said Reynolds' note. ``To the extent such behavior is
found we may well want to initiate an FBI investigation after the
Nov. 4 elections.'' No such probe was ever launched.
   After the hearing, Reynolds' aides said they had provided
Metzenbaum with additional documents on the proposed FBI probe.
None of the additional documents, however, touched on any
involvement by the criminal division in recommending against a
probe, said aides to Metzenbaum.
   Reynolds is counselor to Attorney General Edwin Meese III as
well as assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's civil rights division.

   Syria said it will send in soldiers
Friday to end a 3-week-old bloodbath between rival Shiite Moslem
armies in the slums of south Beirut. Hours later, assassins tried
to kill Syria's four top generals here.
   The ambush failed, the Syrians reported, and the generals
escaped harm.
   Among the targets was Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, the officer who
earlier Thursday announced a truce in the south Beirut fighting and
disclosed Syrian plans to deploy its soldiers there.
   The generals' car was riddled with dozens of machine-gun bullets
Thursday night, but none of the officers or bodyguards was hit,
said Maj. Gen. Saeed Bairakdar, commander of Syria's forces in
Lebanon and a survivor of the ambush.
   Kenaan, Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon, told
reporters in the Lebanese capital upon his return from Damascus,
``Rest assured the slums war is over.''
   A Syrian official told The Associated Press ending the slaughter
will mean new hope for 18 foreign hostages, most of whom are
believed held in the embattled enclave. He pledged that Syria will
do its utmost to gain freedom for the captives, including nine
Americans.
   Fighting in south Beirut dwindled to sporadic sniper fire
exchanges Thursday after the cease-fire was announced. No
casualties were reported.
   But at 9:10 p.m. (3:10 p.m. EDT) gunmen opened up on the
generals' five-car convoy as it drove through Ghobeiry, one of the
embattled districts of south Beirut, Bairakdar told reporters after
arriving in west Beirut.
   He said the four officers were in Kenaan's bullet-proof Mercedes
500 when it was hit with dozens of bullets ``and the gas tank was
holed,'' forcing the generals to abandon the car and drive away in
one of the others in the convoy.
   The other officers were Brig. Gens. Ali Hammoud, intelligence
chief for the Beirut area, and Zuheir Musattati, a deputy to
Bairakdar.
   They were driving back from a meeting with Sheik Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, when attacked, he said.
   It was not clear who the assailants were. Hezbollah controls
most of the territory there.
   In south Lebanon, Israeli warplanes and helicopter gunships
blasted Palestinian guerrilla bases and positions of Hezbollah in
two separate raids.
   Twelve combatants were reported killed and four wounded in the
assaults, the first of which took place during the night and the
second at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. EDT) Thursday.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a group of Shiite fundamentalists
believed to be an umbrella for smaller organizations holding the
foreign hostages. It is Iran's main proxy force in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal militia have been locked in
a bloody fight for control of the 16-square-mile south Beirut
enclave since May 6.
   Police said the fighting killed 296 people and wounded 1,000.
Hezbollah gained control of more than 90 percent of the slums
during the struggle.
   On Thursday, Kenaan announced, ``Zero hour has been set. The
Syrian deployment will begin tomorrow (Friday).''
   He refused to disclose the exact time of the deployment, but
said Syrian forces will set up buffer zones to disengage the
combatants and patrol the suburbs to ``establish security.''
   Kenaan said the warring factions will be allowed to operate
``only political and information offices,'' indicating that the
militiamen will have to lay down arms.
   As he spoke, Kenaan was flanked by Bairakdar and Hammoud.
   Syria is the main power broker in neighboring Lebanon, which has
been wracked by civil war for 13 years.
   The three generals conferred with Shiite religious leaders and
politicians before Kenaan's declaration.
   In Damascus, a Syrian government official said a cease-fire
accord was worked out late Wednesday in a meeting between Syrian
President Hafez Assad and a Hezbollah delegation in Latakia,
northern Syria.
   ``Ending the fighting will create new hope for the hostages and
Syria will spare no effort to secure their release, regardless of
their nationality,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He told AP correspondent Nick Ludington that the accord has been
approved by all parties concerned, including Iran.
   It was not clear if the hostages were part of the deal. But
Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Mohammed Besharati, predicted
last week that the hostage problem would be solved after peace was
restored in south Beirut.
   Syria has had thousands of troops ringing the slums for days,
but a Syrian source in Damascus said Syria never believed it was
possible to obtain release of the hostages by force. The source,
who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the first priority
was to preserve the hostages' lives _ ``then there can be hope for
their release through negotiations.''
   Terry Anderson, chief Mideast correspondent for the AP, is the
longest held hostage. He was captured on March 16, 1985.

   Panama and Cuba, both targets of U.S.
economic sanctions, were elected to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission on Thursday in what was seen as a slap at U.S. policies
in Latin America.
   Colombia also was elected.
   Western diplomats said the election of Cuba, which has been
accused by the United States of widespread human rights violations,
had been expected because of its strong standing in the non-aligned
movement.
   Cuba replaces Nicaragua and is expected to vote in generally the
same way.
   The secret-ballot vote for Panama, however, appeared to be a
strong sympathy vote for that government and a show of anger over
U.S. sanctions and failed efforts to oust its de facto leader, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges.
   The losers were Costa Rica, whose president, Oscar Arias, won
the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his Central American peace
plan, and Guatemala. Panama defeated Costa Rica in a runoff ballot.
   Ethiopia was elected unopposed as one of the African
representatives in another regional vote. Ethiopian authorities
have blocked food relief for famine-stricken regions in an effort
to prevent it from reaching rebels.
   The three Latin American nations were seated for three-year
terms on the major U.N. human rights organization. They were
elected by the 54-member Economic and Social Council, the parent
body.
   Panama's ambassador, Leonardo A. Kamm, said the vote was a
victorious ``message from the people of Panama to those conspiring
to isolate our nation diplomatically. The votes cast for us
demonstrate the political role my country continues to play in the
international arena.''
   Cuban Ambassador Oscar Oramas Oliva said the vote showed that
his country had international support despite efforts by U.S.
officials ``dedicated to a campaign of provocation and lies'' who
sought to condemn Cuba for purported human rights abuses.
   ``This is a victory for truth, reason and the people,'' he said,
adding that Cuba was committed to preserving human rights.
   Cuba was elected on the first ballot, winning 38 votes _ 10 more
than the required 28. Colombia received 46 votes and Panama 31.
   The election was to fill three Latin American seats on the
43-member commission, which represents regional groups.
   The Commission on Human Rights is the major U.N. organization
working to promote and protect human rights. It meets for six weeks
each year in Geneva.
   It makes recommendations to the General Assembly and considers
ways to combat racial discrimination, apartheid and discrimination
against women, children and the disabled.
   Others elected to the commission were Morocco, Swaziland, the
Ukrainian Republic, the Soviet Union, Canada, Sweden, India, Cyprus
and Bangladesh.
   Other elections will be held next year.

<HEAD>Former ABC News Anchor Max Robinson Says His Health Is Private

<TEXT>
   Max Robinson, the country's first black
network television anchor, knows that people think his recent
life-threatening illness might be AIDS, but he refuses to discuss
it.
   ``I take the position that my health is a private matter,'' he
told The Washington Post in an interview at his home in Chicago.
   The Post, in a three-page profile of Robinson published
Thursday, noted that ``it is widely rumored that Robinson has AIDS,
and he's aware of that.''
   ``The curiosity has at times annoyed me,'' Robinson said. ``I'm
just not going to get into the subject of what I have.''
   Robinson, whose TV career took off when he became an anchorman
in Washington in 1969, moved to the ABC network in 1978 when he,
Frank Reynolds and Peter Jennings were the three anchors on ``World
News Tonight.''
   His relations with ABC wer sometimes stormy; he once accused the
network of racism and in 1983 embarrassed ABC executives by missing
Reynolds' funeral service at which he was expected to escort
President and Mrs. Reagan. He left the network in 1984 and worked
briefly at WMAQ-TV in Chicago.
   He has not worked much since, and said he is selling his
Afro-American art collection which has been valued at a
half-million dollars.
   Robinson was hospitalized on Dec. 4 last year in critical
condition and complaining about weight loss. When he was released
nearly two months later, officials refused to discuss his illness.
   ``While in intensive care, he lay in an isolated room, and when
he was moved to another ward, a warning was posted outside his room
to medical personnel to gown and glove before performing certain
tasks in caring for him,'' the newspaper said.
   ``I feel pretty good,'' Robinson said. Asked if he was
terminally ill, the 49-year-old Robinson replied, ``We all are.''

   They operate in the shadow of world leaders,
these witnesses to history who work mostly in anonymity while
greasing the skids of international diplomacy.
   They are the interpreters at superpower summits, and President
Reagan and Soviet leader Gorbachev could not converse without them.
   For the summit in Moscow next week, Harry Obst, head of the
State Department's Language Unit, is sending eight interpreters,
who do oral translations, and four translators for written work.
   ``Language support is the most crucial element of the whole
operation,'' says Obst, whose unit employs 50 interpreters and
translators, with another 1,800 linguists on contract to supply the
government with services in 60 to 70 languages.
   Turning Russian into English and vice versa is not their only
role. As witnesses to the tete-a-tetes between Reagan and
Gorbachev, the interpreters take notes that constitute the only
record of conversations that could determine the fate of nations.
   It's not enough to know one or more foreign languages. Quick
wits and a broad general knowledge are essential.
   For instance, the interpreter assigned to Reagan, Czech-born
Dimitry Zarechnak, has one degree in mathematics, another in
Russian literature. Zarechnak, 44, became the State Department's
senior Russian interpreter in 1982 and attended the three previous
Reagan-Gorbachev summits.
   Interpreters must have great powers of concentration because
they can't very well turn to a president and ask him to repeat his
remarks.
   And being in shape is important.
   William Krimer, who until his retirement in 1982 was the
country's top Russian interpreter, recalls being stuck in a
motorcade several cars away from his principal.
   The motorcade stopped, Krimer ran up to offer his services, and
as he finished, the cars began to move. Running back to his car,
Krimer saw that he wouldn't make it. ``I opened the door of the
nearest car to me, jumped in and landed in the lap of the joint
chiefs,'' he said in an interview last year.
   That was not the only embarrassment Krimer endured. After just a
few months on the job, Krimer was called to interpret at an arms
control briefing. He kept careful notes of the Russian general's
comments, and then sprang into action _ reading his notes back in
Russian.
   When he realized what he was doing and stoppd, he said, the
director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency smiled and told
the Russians: ``Well gentlemen, at least you see you're getting an
accurate rendition of the speech.''
   Not all mistakes are so benign. An interpreter made President
Carter look a bit foolish in front of his hosts on a 1977 trip to
Poland.
   When the president spoke about the Poles' ``desires for the
future,'' interpreter Stephen Seymour's rendition in Polish was
``your lusts for the future.''
   Carter's ``when I left the United States'' was translated into
``when I abandoned the United States.''
   When former Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiao-ping visited the
United States in 1979, he was presented with a 10-gallon hat in
Texas.
   The diminutive visitor, realizing the hat was way too big for
him, handed the hat to his interpreter Ji Chaozhu, who dwarfed Deng
by as much as a full foot.
   Ji was helpful in other ways. When a questioner tried to ask the
vice premier about the delicate issue of a possible Chinese
invasion of Taiwan, the interpreter jumped in, saying Deng had
answered the question previously.
   His action reflected the fact that both the Chinese and Soviet
chief interpreters are more than wordsmiths. Oleg Troyanovsky, for
example, was the interpreter for the late Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev and later became Soviet ambassador to the United Nations.
   Viktor Sukhodrev, Gorbachev's personal interpreter, also has a
top foreign ministry post in Moscow.
   Sukhodrev is a virtual legend on the summit circuit. Former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger describes Sukhodrev in his book
``The White House Years'' as ``splendid'' and ``unflappable.''
   Kissinger recalls only one time when Sukhodrev was stumped.
Former President Richard Nixon suggested at the 1972 Moscow summit
that certain U.S. and Soviet actions in the Middle East were
preparatory to ``the nut-cutting stage.''
   Sukhodrev interpreted the phrase literally as ``cutting the
fruit from a tree,'' Kissinger wrote, ``to the obvious
mystification'' of everyone.
   Sukhodrev will probably be aided at the Moscow summit by Pavel
Palazchenko and Nikolai Uspenskiy, said Obst. Zarechnak will be
assisted by William Hopkins and Peter Afanasenko.

   Police said Thursday they had no
information about a Belgian physician missing since the weekend,
but Palestinian sources said Dr. Jan Cools was kidnapped in south
Lebanon.
   The Popular Committee, which runs daily affairs at Rashidiyeh, a
Palestinian refugee camp, said in a statement that Cools was
abducted near the ancient port of Tyre by gunmen.
   It said Cools, 32, left his base at the Rashidiyeh camp Saturday
in a taxi headed for Tyre, two miles to the north, and was
``abducted at a road junction leading to Qana,'' about midway. It
gave no further details.
   His Norwegian employers, a relief group called Norwac, said the
Cools left Rashidiyeh at 2 p.m. Saturday.
   Amal, the mainstream Shiite Moslem militia, seized control of
Tyre and other sectors of south Lebanon in April after crushing the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah in the area.
   A statement from Amal said it was ``investigating the Belgian
doctor's case'' and ``parties carrying out their own plots in south
Lebanon'' may have kidnapped him. It did not elaborate.
   Eighteen foreigners are missing, and most are believed to be
captives of Shiite extremists linked to Hezbollah. Held the longest
is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   A Navy officer who defeated fraternization
charges brought against her because of her relationship with a
Marine enlisted man said Thursday she loves the service and hopes
her case will change military policy.
   ``I love my husband. I love the Navy, and I don't see why the
two are not compatible,'' Lt. Kathleen A. Mazure, 29, told
reporters at a news conference a day after a Marine Corps general
dropped the charges.
   Ms. Mazure, a dentist assigned to the Marine Corps Air Ground
Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, Calif., was accompanied by her
husband, former Lance Cpl. Scott Price, and her parents, Jim and
Pat Mazure.
   ``I hope that from out of this the fraternization policy will
become more defined, so that people won't have to go through what I
had to, because it is very ill-defined,'' she said.
   Ms. Mazure, formerly of Mercer Island, Wash., was cleared of all
charges after Tuesday's 4{-hour hearing before Maj. Gen. Gene
Deegan, said Mark Rosenbaum, an American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer.
   ``I'm very proud of my wife for holding up so well,'' said
Price, 24, of Eden, Texas, who married her Nov. 28 and left the
Marines after the charges were brought.
   The charges brought Nov. 25 marked ``the first time in the
history of the United States ... that charges of fraternization
have been brought against an officer for conduct with a member of
another branch of the service,'' Rosenbaum said.
   He emphasized that Ms. Mazure and her husband were not in the
same chain of command.
   On Jan. 11, a hearing was held to determine whether she should
be court-martialed and on Jan. 19 the hearing officer recommended
there should be no court-martial, Rosenbaum said.
   Deegan overruled the recommendation and on Feb. 16 the case was
referred to a court-martial. On Monday the court-martial charges
were dropped and on Tuesday Deegan held a non-judicial hearing that
resulted in final dismissal of the allegation, the attorney said.
   A base spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer Doug Hauth, said Deegan
``was of the opinion that because of her background and training
and short time assigned to this Marine Corps command, that
fundamental fairness required that she not be held criminally
accountable for her relationship.''
   Ms. Mazure said she does not believe the incident will affect
her career. ``I feel that the work I do and the way I am should be
able to show for itself what kind of person I am, that I do intend
to make the Navy my career,'' she said.
   Ms. Mazure said she was stationed in Jacksonville, Fla., when
she met Price during an evening of dancing in July 1986, and that
neither knew the other was in the service until after several dates.
   They kept in touch through letters when Price was transferred to
the California desert base. She said she was offered a post at
Twentynine Palms and was transferred there on Sept. 27, 1987.
   Rosenbaum said items presented at Tuesday's hearing included a
document from the office of the chief of naval operations ``that
states that there is no formal policy regarding fraternization.''
   Also presented was a 1985 study by the Department of Navy
``which found that fraternization ... within one's own chain of
command ... was absolutely rampant and that the majority of
individuals in the Navy simply had no idea as to what constitutes
wrongful fraternization,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee's chairman
introduced legislation Thursday that would prevent healthy savings
institutions from fleeing the ailing federal fund that insures
their deposits.
   Sixteen Democrats and seven Republicans are backing a bill
introduced by Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I. It would bar S&Ls
from leaving the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. until
Aug. 10, 1989 _ one year longer than a ban currently in effect.
   Congress last summer included the initial moratorium in
legislation providing for a $10.8 billion industry-financed
infusion into FSLIC, which insures S&L deposits up to $100,000.
   Because the insurance premium charged by FSLIC is roughly 2{
times greater than the premium charged the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., legislators fear that thrifts eligible for
admission to the FDIC will leave FSLIC and become banks.
   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress,
warned last week that the S&L fund may not have enough money coming
in to take care of the roughly 500 S&Ls listed as insolvent.
   ``Any flight of (healthy) institutions whose insurance premiums
help pay the bills would be a further blow to an already weakened
fund,'' St Germain said in a statement.
   St Germain introduced the legislation after receiving a letter
Wednesday from the top federal regulator of savings institutions,
Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who supports
extending the moratorium.
   Wall said the bank board did not know how many S&Ls would leave
the fund if they could, but, he said, ``The most important value in
this equation at the moment is perception _ the perception that
without the moratorium there may be a major exodus from FSLIC.''
   Mark Clark, senior vice president of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the largest trade group in the industry, said
extending the moratorium is unfair to savings institutions and
breaks the agreement Congress made with the industry last year.
   ``We don't advocate mass exodus. All we're saying is there ought
to be free choice,'' Clark said.

   Juan Orol, a leading director during the
``golden age'' of Mexican cinema, died Thursday of complications
from diabetes, his family said. He was 90.
   Among his best known movies were ``Mother Dearest,'' his first,
in 1935; ``The Right and the Duty'' in 1937; and ``The Reign of the
Gangsters'' and ``Tania, the Beautiful Savage,'' both in 1947.
   Orol was born in Spain and emigrated to Mexico in 1917.
   He was a founding member of the Association of Movie Producers.
He served as producer, director, screenwriter and editor on almost
all his movies.
   Many of his films featured music, especially with tropical
rhythms, and gangsters, cabarets or wrestling.
   Orol dressed in classic gangster style at a tribute to him in
April, wearing an elegant black suit with white stripes, a white
shirt with black stripes, a black satin tie and black shoes and
socks.

   The second anti-Castro terrorist bombing here this
month forced a forum on U.S.-Cuba relations out of a downtown hotel
Thursday, and some Cuban exile leaders say such incidents must end.
   The 3 a.m. blast Thursday injured no one, but demolished a
garage door, tore away part of a concrete wall and blew out the
windows of a car at the home of Maria Christina Herrera in Coral
Gables.
   Ms. Herrera, a Miami-Dade Community College professor who heads
a group advocating more dialogue with Castro's Cuba, sponsored a
forum on the future of U.S.-Cuba relations on Thursday afternoon.
The site of the forum was hastily moved after the bombing.
   ``This is a cowardly attack,'' she said in her damaged home.
``This is an attack on freedom, democracy and freedom of expression
_ the right to do whatever you want in a civilized way.''
   The Sheraton-Brickell Point Hotel, where the forum was to take
place, pulled out after the bombing. But University of Miami
President Edward T. Foote agreed to let the university serve as
host for the event instead, ``in the interests of academic
freedom,'' said a school spokeswoman, Conchita Ruiz-Topinka.
   The event went off without incident at the university's faculty
club, where security guards screened everyone who attended.
   The FBI and Coral Gables police were investigating the case. No
one claimed responsibility for the attack, but authorities had few
doubts about its motivation.
   ``She feels that a new approach should be used toward Cuba,''
said FBI Special Agent George Kiscynski. ``She has probably made
some enemies in the community, and has become the victim of a
terrorist attack.''
   The bombing was the second this month apparently aimed at
protesting closer relations with Cuba. On May 3, a pipe bomb blew
in the door of the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture after a show
featuring some painters still in Cuba who critics said were too
close to Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   Some of the same Cuban radio talks shows and news programs that
had called for opposition to the art show also bitterly attacked
the forum sponsored by Ms. Herrera's group, the Institute of Cuban
Studies, and she blamed them for inflaming the situation.
   ``All of these people in the community that are haranguing
people on the radio against our debate today are somewhat
responsible for this action, morally at least,'' she said.
   Xavier Bray, founder of the Spanish American League Against
Discrimination, said the attacks undermine the freedoms Cubans came
to the United States to enjoy.
   ``This isn't a question to be settled only by the force of arms,
but by the force of reason, by being able to exchange ideas,'' he
said Thursday.
   The bombing came 2{ hours after a meeting at Ms. Herrera's
house, at which conference organizers decided not to include a
visiting representative of the unofficial Cuban human rights
commission, Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz.
   He is a former political prisoner given permission by the Castro
government to set up his organization. His trip to the United
States and request to be included in the forum made anticommunists
here suspicious, and the organizers decided his participation would
only further anger anti-Castro militants.
   Sanchez was allowed into the meeting at the university as an
observer, not a participant in the forum.
   Bill Ripple, general manager of the Sheraton-Brickell Point
Hotel, said the hotel canceled the conference ``based on the best
interests of our employees and guests because of the recent
incidents, including the bombing.''

   Pregnant women should limit alcohol consumption to
fewer than 10 drinks a week, say researchers who found no evidence
of physical harm to the fetuses of women who drank below that
amount.
   The study, at a hospital coordinating European-wide studies on
the issue, was reported Thursday in the British Medical Journal.
   It found that while most of the 846 women surveyed tended to
drink little or no alcohol during pregnancy, the few who had more
than 10 drinks weekly had babies with smaller-than-normal heads.
   Babies of mothers who drank more than 12 drinks scored low on a
standard test of newborns, indicating the babies were ``at
considerable risk,'' the study of mothers in Dundee, Scotland,
found.
   The study defined a standard drink as about .35 ounces of pure
alcohol, or about as much as in a glass of wine, eight ounces of
beer, or 1.18 ounces of hard liquor.
   Although some previous studies reached similar findings for low
levels of maternal drinking, other studies linked even light
drinking with increased risk of slight neurological and behavioral
defects in the child.
   Medical authorities generally recommend that pregnant women
avoid alcohol entirely. No ``safe'' consumption level has been
firmly established, and some fetuses may be particularly
susceptible, they warn.
   Authors of the new study say their findings indicate that more
attention should be paid to detecting and helping mothers whose
drinking puts their fetuses at special risk.
   ``According to our results, we didn't think social drinking
created any harm,'' said Dr. Nabeel Sulaiman, of the department of
community medicine at Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, where
the research was conducted. He added, ``The majority of mothers do
abstain or drink very little after learning they were pregnant.''
   ``But 2 percent of our women drank more than 10 drinks per week
_ that is the risky group. If we want to do anything in terms of
health education, we should point it toward these,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   The 1985-1986 study, published in the May 28 issue of the
journal, was carried out at Ninewells, a hospital where almost
every Dundee woman has her baby.
   Sulaiman said the fact that women in the area have little choice
but to go to Ninewells to deliver helped provide a better
cross-section of the population.
   The report, based on first children, found that most women
naturally tended to drink less or not at all during pregnancy.
   Before realizing they were pregnant, 90 percent of the women
drank, but by the end of the first four months of pregnancy only 56
percent drank, and in later months, only 2 percent.
   It said a sample of 230 mothers said they drank less due to
concern for their baby, problems with nausea, a lack of opportunity
or because it smelled or tasted bad.
   ``From the 92 percent of our sample who were either non-drinkers
or consuming less than 50 grams (1.75 ounces) absolute alcohol .. .
(per) week, we conclude that social drinking at a low level is very
unlikely to have a harmful effect on the fetus,'' said the article.
   ``As there was no detectable effect on pregnancy of alcohol
consumption below 100 grams (3.50 ounces) ... (per) week, it is
suggested that health education should be directed toward mothers
who drink more than this amount.''
   In conclusion, the article said, ``We would advise women who are
planning to become pregnant to limit their alcohol consumption .. .
to below 10 drinks ... (per) week.''
   Mothers who consumed more than 10 drinks weekly had babies with
smaller circumference heads, which ``implies on average that the
baby hasn't developed to the same degree'' as others, said Dr.
Charles Du V. Florey, another of the four authors.

   The first Soviet experts to visit a
chemical weapons facility in Western Europe accused the United
States Thursday of blocking progress on a global treaty banning the
weapons.
   At a news conference, the Soviet and British envoys to the
40-nation treaty negotiations disagreed about the consequences of
America's resumption of the production of binary chemical weapons
last December.
   Yuri Nazarkin, chief Soviet envoy to the talks in Geneva, said
the U.S. plans ``undoubtedly run counter to the aim of a chemical
weapons convention and they undermine the confidence-building
process.''
   But Nazarkin said the three-day visit to Britain's Chemical
Warfare Defense Center by a 13-member group of Soviet technical and
military experts helped pave the way for a chemical weapons ban.
   ``We firmly believe that this convention will be achievable
soon,'' he said.
   He said British officials were forthcoming in talks and helpful
in showing the Soviets around the sprawling 7,000-acre facility at
Porton Down, where the Soviets watched soldiers in gas masks react
to a simulated nerve gas attack.
   Tessa Solesby, the British negotiator at the Geneva talks, said
Washington resumed making chemical weapons to counter the Soviets'
production and to replace aging stockpiles.
   Miss Solesby also rejected arguments by Nazarkin that the Geneva
talks needed a push from the American, Soviet and British leaders,
and said the main problem was the difficulty of verifying any
agreement.
   ``It is not a matter of lack of political will. ... it's the
technical difficulties that remain,'' she said.
   Dr. Graham Pearson, director of the Porton Down center, said the
Soviet visit was a ``significant first step toward building
confidence between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom.''
   Britain ceased making chemical weapons and destroyed its
stockpile in the 1950s and says Porton Down is only for defensive
measures, such as the production of gas masks and monitoring
equipment.
   In July, a British team will visit the chemical warfare facility
at Shikhany in eastern Russia.
   Western experts visited Shikhany briefly last year and Soviet
inspectors went to a U.S. Army chemical weapons disposal plant in
Toole, Utah.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev acknowledged last year for
the first time that the Soviet Union has a chemical weapon
stockpile, which he put at 50,000 tons, but said production of more
weapons had stopped.
   Western governments say the Soviet stockpile totals 300,000
tons, which would make it the largest in the world.
   The Soviets say the United States has a 50,000-ton stockpile _
20,000 tons higher than Western estimates.
   The United States' renewed production of binary weapons _
separate agents that are lethal only when combined _ ended an
18-year moratorium on making the arms.

   A woman who apparently set up
housekeeping in David Letterman's house while the TV talk show host
was out of town was arrested in New Jersey driving his sports car,
authorities said.
   Mary Ray, 36, of no known address, was arrested Sunday night
when she stopped at the Lincoln Tunnel as she was driving into New
York from New Jesey.
   She didn't have the $3 toll and told the toll collector she was
Letterman's wife, said Armando Arrastia, a spokesman for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   A 3-year-old boy was a passenger in the car, Arrastia said.
   Ms. Ray gave authorities permission to go through the glove
compartment of the blue 1988 Porsche Carrera, where they found
registration showing the car belongs to Letterman, he said.
   Authorities ``got in touch with Letterman himself, who said the
woman is not his wife and didn't have permission to drive his
car,'' said Arrastia. He said he was unsure whether Letterman knew
the woman.
   The host of NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman''
immediately reported the car stolen to the New Canaan Police
Department and Ms. Ray was charged with receiving stolen property,
Arrastia said.
   ``She gave no indication as to where she was from or what she
was doing in the area,'' Arrastia said.
   Ms. Ray was released into the custody of the Hudson County
prosecutor's office in Jersey City, N.J.
   Hudson County First Assistant Prosecutor Frank DeStefano said
Thursday the woman was arraigned Monday in Superior Court and bail
was set at $5,000 with a $500 cash option. ``As far as I know it's
been posted,'' he said.
   There was no answer at the county jail Thursday night, and
efforts to determine how the woman made bail were unsuccessful.
DeStefano said she is due to appear on the charge against her in
Weehawken Municipal Court on May 31.
   Arrastia said the woman intially ``told the police officer that
her name was Jane Doe. She said she is also known as Mary Ray.''
   She also ``indicated to our police that she is non-domiciled,''
Arrastia said. ``I guess that means homeless in her context.''
   Arrastia also did not know what relation, if any, she has to the
child.
   The boy was placed in the custody of the New Jersey Division of
Youth and Family Services, Arrastia said. A spokeswoman for DYFS
could not be reached for comment immediately. There was no answer
at her office or at her home.
   New Canaan police went to Letterman's home and found that it had
been ``entered,'' said Capt. Michael Angelastro.
   He said there appeared to be ```some validity'' to a report in
Thursday's editions of the New York Daily News that the woman had
moved into Letterman's house with the child.
   ``It appears that someone has been living in the house for the
last couple of days,'' he said, adding the some plants and a rug
appeared to have been moved.
   ``But we're not saying it was her,'' Angelastro said, because
Letterman declined to press charges. ``We are not pursuing it,'' he
said.
   Letterman did not immediately return a telephone call to his NBC
offices seeking comment.

   NATO formally asked Italy Thursday to
be the host country for a U.S. jet fighter wing that Spain is
expelling from its territory.
   But the allies quarreled over how to pay for the move, officials
said.
   Italy was expected to accept the 72 nuclear-capable F-16 jets if
the allies paid to expand Gioia del Colle, a small air base in
southeastern Italy that could be the planes' new home.
   A U.S. official in Brussels said a final decision on the Italian
site would be made later. He also said details on financing the
move would be put off.
   In Rome, a senior Italian official said Italy agreed in
principle to accept the F-16s, but the government and Parliament
must still examine the proposal.
   The issue dominated the opening session of a two-day meeting of
defense ministers from all North Atlantic Treaty Organization
members except France, which is not part of NATO's joint military
structure.
   The defense chiefs also planned to issue on Friday a joint
statement of support for President Reagan prior to his meetings
next week in Moscow with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said
the officials.
   All the officials spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Alliance officials portrayed the decision to ask Italy to accept
the jets as an important display of Europe's resolve to bear its
share of the NATO defense burden.
   ``This is an important step toward preserving NATO's common
defense and to sharing the burdens of doing so equitably among the
alliance as a whole,'' said Lord Carrington, the NATO
secretary-general.
   ``All agreed that this is an alliance matter and that the
alliance should help finance it,'' said Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg of
West Germany, the alliance's chief military adviser.
   Spain declared in January that the F-16s would have to leave
Spanish territory within three years as part of a domestically
popular drive to lessen the U.S. military presence in Spain.
   The planes play an important role in NATO's strategy for
carrying out a nuclear response to a possible attack by the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Altenburg told reporters that NATO's Military Committee, the
alliance's highest military authority, advised the defense
ministers meeting that Italy was ``the only suitable country'' to
take the aircraft, which are dedicated to the defense of southern
Europe.
   Italy has indicated it would be willing to have the F-16s based
on its soil, as long as a formal NATO request was made and the
alliance paid for moving the planes and the 4,000 U.S. personnel
and their dependents.
   The NATO defense ministers agreed in principle that the cost of
relocating the U.S. jet fighters should be met by NATO's
infrastructure budget, which is a common pool of money used to
build military facilities.
   There was disagreement, however, over whether the amount needed
for the move _ estimated by U.S. officials at roughly $500 million
_ should be added to the infrastructure budget. The American view
was that 100 percent of the cost should be added to the budget.
Others said no additional money should be made available, according
to several officials.
   It appeared that the financing details would be left unresolved
for the time being. The planes aren't scheduled to be moved until
1991.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told his NATO colleagues
that a decision to keep the F-16s in Europe would help blunt U.S.
congressional complaints that the European allies are not pulling
their weight in the alliance, said an official who was present at
the ministers' meeting.
   The ministers were expected on Friday to publicly call for an
alliance study of how common defense costs and responsibilities are
shared.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebels on Thursday offered
a plan to lay down their arms, but set conditions the government
termed ``provoking, preposterous'' and contrary to earlier accords.
   The U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, tied their proposal
to stop pursuing the 6{-year-old war to measures aimed at what they
called ``democratization of Nicaragua.''
   The rebels, speaking at the opening of a new round of peace
talks, demanded within five days freedom of the press and broadcast
media, an end to the military draft, and freedom to supply their
forces in the field.
   Manuel Espinoza, the presidential spokesman, quickly described
the plan as preposterous and said, ``The Contra proposal is
unrealistic and casts aside all that has been done and agreed upon
until now and makes new proposals.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said, ``With this
proposal, they're acting as if they had won the war and the
Sandinistas had surrendered.''
   Alfredo Cesar, chief of the rebel delegation, said Thursday the
offer contains ``democratic changes the country should make at the
end of the war.''
   Tinoco said the leftist Sandinista government was proposing
discussion of ``guarantees in the electoral process, dates for
municipal elections, reforms in the electoral law, pluralistic
representation in the electoral council and guarantees and norms
for the functioning of a mixed economy.''
   Rebel leaders said their plan deals with both military and
political issues.
   At the center of the Contra proposal was a demand that the
Sandinistas ease their control over the army and government. They
also seek constitutional reforms and freedom of expression.
   Under what the rebels call a ``flexible'' timetable, they would
lay down their arms sometime before Christmas.
   ``We have come here to present a comprehensive proposal to the
government for a global solution to the war,'' Cesar said late
Wednesday.
   He leads delegates of the Nicaraguan Resistance, umbrella
organization for the rebels.
   Cesar said the rebels were prepared to make a ``special effort
to achieve a definitive cease-fire.''
   The delegations met under tight security at the Camino Real
Hotel. Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and the brother
of President Daniel Ortega, heads the government delegation.
   Rebel representatives include their military leader, Col.
Enrique Bermudez, who was making his first trip to Managua since
the war started in late 1981.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and Joao Baena
Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
were witnesses.
   Cesar said rebels ``are not optimistic'' about the outcome of
the meeting because they said the government has not complied with
a preliminary peace plan agreed upon March 23 in Sapoa, a southern
border town.
   At Sapoa, the two sides agreed to a 60-day cease-fire and on the
basis for further talks to arrange a permanent truce.
   The cease-fire expires May 30, but President Ortega said he
would extend it for an additional 30 days.
   Rebel leaders have said they want a permanent truce but will not
break Ortega's unilateral extension of the peace.
   The meeting was the third between rebel and government
representatives in Managua since the Sapoa accord.
   Ortega says the war has killed 26,500 people and caused $3
billion in damage to the economy.

   Isolated showers and thunderstorms rumbled across the north
central region Thursday, with rain, hail and gusty winds in parts
of North Dakota as a cold front moved slowly across the region, but
much of the nation was dry.
   In western North Dakota, Watford City reported winds gusting to
60 mph, and Roseglen reported 56-mph gusts. Other showers and
thunderstorms were reported on the Minnesota-Iowa line and in
northern Lower Michigan.
   Central Florida also had showers and thunderstorms, and showers
were scattered across much of New England. Other showers and
thunderstorms were developing over the Colorado Rockies into north
central New Mexico.
   Skies were mostly sunny Thursday afternoon from the Ohio Valley
and middle Atlantic states into the Southeast, with readings in the
60s and 70s.
   Temperatures across the central and southern Plains into Texas
were in the 70s and 80s, with skies partly cloudy.
   Skies were partly cloudy in the central Pacific Coast, and sunny
skies prevailed from the valleys of California across the desert
Southwest.
   The low for the nation Thursday was 28 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT cdt ranged from
45 degrees at Caribou, Maine, to 103 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The national weather forecast for Friday called for numerous
showers and thunderstorms across the southern tip of Florida,
scattered showers across the Northern Pacific and the northern
Rockies. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop late in
the afternoon across western parts of South Dakota. Otherwise, most
of the nation will have mostly sunny skies.
   High temperatures will be in the 70s or 80s over much of the
nation; in the 60s along the central and northern Pacific Coast
into northern Washington state; into the 90s across inland southern
Texas; and, from the mid 90s to 105 degrees across the desert
Southwest.

   The head of the Alabama NAACP, accused
of taking $10,000 to use his influence as a lawmaker to help a
murderer get early parole, appeared before a county grand jury
Thursday, one day after he was indicted on federal extortion
charges.
   A federal grand jury is scheduled June 14 to hear the bribery
charges against Thomas Reed, the longtime state president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Federal investigators said their investigation is aimed solely
at Reed, who's also a state representative. Montgomery County
District Attorney Jimmy Evans said the county grand jury is looking
into the problem of preferential treatment of prisoners by state
parole officials.
   Several officials of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles also
appeared before the grand jury Thursday.
   ``I'd say for the last four or five years we've had a nagging
question in this state: Can you buy early release or early
parole?'' Evans said. ``We're interested in knowing how widespread
the practice is.''
   Evans said the grand jury would probably return Friday for a
short session. He did not say when he expected the investigation to
finish.
   Reed, co-chairman of the Legislature's Joint Prison Committee,
is accused of taking $10,000 from the uncle of Anthony Chesser and
agreeing to use his influence as a legislator to try to get
Chesser's early release from prison.
   The FBI's investigation surfaced last week, with Reed
complaining it was in retaliation for his efforts to remove the
Confederate battle flag from the Alabama Capitol dome. Reed, a
businessman, in 1970 became one of the first two blacks elected to
the Alabama Legislature this century.
   The FBI said Reed got the state parole board to move up
Chesser's parole consideration date from 1994 to 1989. Chesser,
convicted of murdering his wife, began serving a 40-year sentence
in August 1984. But then Reed's efforts were reversed, and the
uncle demanded a refund.
   Reed repaid $8,000 and promised to refund the rest, the FBI said.
   The meeting between the uncle and Reed was taped, with the
uncle's cooperation, the FBI said. ``You could hear the money being
counted,'' said U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson.
   Reed's central Alabama district does not include Anthony
Chesser's hometown of Phenix City, and his uncle, Bobby Gene
Chesser, is from Columbus, Ga. The two legislators who represent
Phenix City, Rep. Charles Adams and Sen. Danny Corbett, said
neither Reed nor Bobby Gene Chesser contacted them about getting an
early parole for the convicted murderer.
   The FBI's investigation of Reed, 60, surfaced last week, with
Reed complaining the probe was in retaliation for his efforts to
remove the Confederate flag from the Alabama Capitol dome.
   Reed drew widespread attention Feb. 2 when he made a symbolic
bid to remove the flag from the Capitol. Reed and 13 other black
legislators were arrested and charged with misdemeanor trespassing
in a case that is pending.
   The FBI has denied any connection between the flag controversy
and the case against Reed.

   Vice President George Bush on Thursday proposed an international
strike force to hit ``quick and hard and often'' at foreign drug
operations. Democrat Michael Dukakis campaigned in California while
more than $100 million state tax increases neared his governor's
desk back in Massachusetts.
   Bush, the all-but-sure Republican presidential nominee, also
called for denying federal contracts to U.S. companies lacking
``drug-free programs,'' a proposal an aide said could involve
mandatory drug testing.
   Dukakis, however, made fun of Bush's recent drug proposals:
``The question is, `Why haven't these been done the past seven
years? Isn't the vice president in charge of this (anti-drug)
effort?''
   Democrats Dukakis and Jesse Jackson were concentrating on
California, the biggest delegate prize in the June 7 presidential
primary finale, while Bush campaigned in New Jersey on the way to
his Maine seacoast retreat.
   For Dukakis, who has campaigned as a tax-cutting governor, the
prospect of being saddled with an election-year tax increase loomed
as he sought votes 3,000 miles away.
   His state legislature gave approval to increases in cigarette
and other taxes totaling more than $100 million as a remedy for
newly found budget deficits. A final vote was needed, but the
legislation cleared its major hurdle over Republican objections.
   Dukakis declined to say whether he would sign the cigarette tax
increase.
   With Dukakis leading Bush in recent polls, the vice president's
pollster Robert Teeter said the Bush campaign is concerned but not
panic-stricken.
   ``You'd rather be ahead. But surely there is no feeling of
crisis or panic,'' Teeter said. ``We're a long way ahead of the
election. A lot of decision-making is yet to come.''
   An ABC-Washington Post poll gave Dukakis a 53 percent to 40
percent lead over Bush, ABC reported Thursday night. The survey,
based on telephone interviews with 1,508 people between May 19 and
Monday, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
   Bush plans to take a week off for meetings with party leaders
and advisers in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   He launched a new anti-drug initiative on Thursday, including
the call for a drug strike force, possibly under the auspices of
the United Nations, to be created ``to hit back, quick and hard and
often, at foreign drug operations.'' U.S. involvement would be
coordinated by a military officer reporting to Bush's vice
president.
   Bush spoke in Secaucus, N.J., then visited a drug rehabilitation
center in nearby Newark, where he talked with patients.
   He said he opposed relaxing the Justice Department's ``zero
tolerance'' policy for seizing yachts and other vehicles in which
drugs are found. ``I think it makes great sense,'' he said.
   With his own aides acknowledging the vice president has been
hurt by the controversy over Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Bush
sought to turn the attention to the Democrats by renewing his call
for a federal special prosecutor to investigate House Speaker Jim
Wright's finances.
   ``I wonder if Mike Dukakis and Jesse Jackson will join me in
calling for the House of Representatives to appoint a special
prosecutor to look into its own troubles, starting with the
speaker,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis visited a company-sponsored day care center in Palo
Alto, Calif., where he called for more investment in schools and
``clear guidelines'' to limit corporate mergers.
   ``Today as in 1960 we're fighting for the economic future of
America,'' Dukakis said. ``And now, as then, old ways simply will
not do.''
   Dukakis offered no defense of Wright, except to say it was
``proper and appropriate'' that the speaker had pledged cooperation
with any ethics committee probe into his activities. Dukakis said
Bush should not try to exploit the Wright issue, and referred again
to administration dealings with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``I'm going to continue to insist on a full explanation from the
administration about what's going on'' with Noriega, he said.
   Jackson also made California campaign appearances, a day after
he and Dukakis debated in San Francisco. He said Dukakis has
followed his lead on South Africa and in making drugs an issue.
   ``He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' Jackson said in San Jose.
   The two men met privately after the debate, an hour-long session
in which they aimed their strongest words at the Reagan
administration for dealings with Noriega.
   Jackson, who released a five-year budget blueprint this week,
did urge Dukakis to spell out his spending plans.
   ``The governor is laying out a budget of promises but not a
budget of numbers,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis replied that his experience as governor taught him it
was a ``serious mistake'' to lay out a detailed budget plan so far
in advance, because the revenue picture can change drastically.
   The Dukakis campaign, meanwhile, announced the appointment of
Dayton Duncan as national press secretary. He was deputy national
press secretary in Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign.

   A suspicious device was removed from an office
down the hall from Sen. Edmward M. Kennedy's office in a downtown
Boston federal building Thursday, but authorities later found it
was not a bomb, an FBI spokesman said.
   ``It has no explosive capability. It has no incendiary
capability,'' said FBI spokesman Jack Cloherty. The parcel
contained some inactive electronic components, he said.
   Cloherty said agents were trying to determine if the parcel was
planted in the Department of Health and Human Services office as a
ruse or simply left behind. No calls claiming responsibility for
the device were received, he said.
   Bomb squad officers took the device to an island in Boston
Harbor and determined that it was not explosive, said police
spokesman John Eisenthal. It was destroyed with a high-pressure
water cannon.
   The device was found in a paper bag in the office on the 24th
floor of the John F. Kennedy federal building, about 15 yards from
a district office of Sen. Kennedy, who was in Washington, said a
spokesman in his Boston office.
   Workers were allowed back onto the floor after the device was
removed, police and the FBI said.

<TEXT>
   Legislators set aside a
drawn-out dispute over election results on Thursday, allowing the
National Assembly to convene formally nearly one month late.
   Lawmakers from the Republican Nationalist Alliance and the
governing Christian Democrats reached accord to open the
legislature after three hours of negotiations at the National
Assembly, El Salvador's single-chamber congress.
   The rightist Alliance, known by its Spanish acronym Arena, won
at least 30 seats in March 20 elections for the 60-seat Assembly.
   Arena contends it won 31 seats and that the Christian Democrats
stole one through fraud. Arena's claim to the seat is pending
before the Supreme Court.
   The Central Elections Council gave the Christian Democrats 23
seats and the small National Conciliation Party seven seats.
   The National Assembly was to have been installed May 1.
   By Thursday night, only one legislator of the National
Conciliation Party backed the Arena-Christian Democrat agreement.
He indicated he would vote with Arena on most bills, in effect
giving the rightists a majority.
   Ricardo Alvarenga Valdivieso, president of the legislature,
announced the agreement at an impromptu news conference in the
Assembly.
   ``We have had differing positions and juridical arguments, but
when the will exists anything is possible in order to respond to
the clamor of a people that wants to see the Assembly working,''
said Julio Rey Prendes, the Christian Democratic Party leader and a
legislator.
   Alfredo Cristiani, president of Arena and one of its lawmakers,
said: ``We're pleased this problem has been resolved. Here there
are no winners and no losers. From now on, the winner is the
Salvadoran people, who will benefit by the normalization of the
Assembly.''
   Arena tried to unilaterally install the legislature on May 1
with its 30 lawmakers. According to law a majority of lawmakers
must be on hand to inaugurate an assembly session, and the other
parties refused to recognize the body's validity.

   Explosions at a military arms dump in
central Zambia killed one person and wounded 48, most of them
seriously, the government said Thursday.
   The explosions at the Kohima army barracks at Kabwe, 75 miles
north of Lusaka, went on for six hours Wednesday night, said Grey
Zulu of President Kenneth Kaunda's governing party. Officials did
not say if sabotage was suspected.
   Zulu said the government ordered an investigation.
   Buildings and factories near the barracks were set ablaze.
Shrapnel, debris and the remnants of armor-piercing missiles were
found up to 10 miles from the munitions dump.
   Doctors at Kabwe hospital said the wounded included women and
children living in houses near the barracks. They said emergency
services were disrupted because explosions cut power lines to the
hospital and its standby generator had been stolen.
   Home Minister Paul Maluktila and the military and civil defense
chiefs visited Kabwe on Thursday, officials said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials on Thursday strongly defended
restrictions against Japan becoming a global military power as
trade and foreign aid spending transform it into a political and
economic superpower.
   Foreign aid is a natural area for Japan to contribute to global
stability ``given Japan's policy, which we fully support ... not to
play a global military role,'' said Deputy Defense Secretary
William Howard Taft IV.
   Japan will surpass the United States as the world's leading aid
donor this year and it can still afford a further ``dramatic
increase'' in aid, Taft added.
   Taft's statement was distributed to the Senate defense
appropriations subcommittee. His position was echoed in testimony
by other Pentagon officials and the State Department at a hearing
on the defense burden shared by the United States and its Northeast
Asian allies, Japan and South Korea.
   Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage reminded
senators that after the defeat of Japan in World War II, ``the
United States played a major and direct role'' in framing the
constitution that continues to bar Japan from maintaining offensive
military force.
   Asian neighbors occupied by Japan during the war and the
Japanese people themselves ``don't want to see Rising Sun flags on
strategic bombers, carrier battle groups or other power projection
systems _ nor do we,'' Armitage added.
   He said Japan obviously could afford to spend more on
self-defense and will do so, but ``in terms of military roles and
missions, Japan is correctly oriented already.''
   Meanwhile, Japan should substantially increase unrestricted aid
grants to poorer countries in addition to boosting existing support
for the upkeep of 55,000 American military personnel in Japan, he
said.
   Other countries in the region accept a defense-oriented military
buildup by Japan but ``they remain sensitive about any indication
that Japan might develop offensive capabilities or seek a regional
security role,'' said Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
   Japan has doubled its foreign aid several times since 1980 and
in the coming year will pass the United States as the world's
leading aid donor, Taft said.

   The state law that bans exit polling within
200 feet of the voting place is an unconstitutional infringement on
the right to free speech, a lawyer for the NBC television network
argued Thursday.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York City attorney specializing in
media-related cases, cited a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decision striking down a similar law in Washington state earlier
this year.
   NBC, in arguments before U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell, is
trying to have the 1985 law lifted for the state's June 7 primary
election. Lovell took the arguments under advisement. No decision
is expected until next week.
   Exit polls ask people after they've cast their ballots for whom
they voted and are used by news organizations to project the
winners of elections. The state contends its ban protects voters'
privacy and voting decorum.
   Patricia Schaeffer, an assistant attorney general representing
Montana, said the law was designed to balance the interests of the
media in reporting on elections and the right of voters to ``order
and dignity'' at the polls.
   Some legislators felt voters and been harassed and intimidated
by people conducting exit polls in the past, she said.
   Abrams contended that the law was enacted out of frustration
over election night projections that declare winners before voting
ends and maintains the statute denies the network its First
Amendment rights.
   He said other state laws already protect the decorum of the
voting place and can be used if troubles arise with pollsters, he
said.
   Asking people how they voted after they cast their ballots
``cannot be said to be an intrusion upon privacy,'' Abrams said.
``A voter has the right to say `I don't want to talk to you','' he
said.
   The 9th Circuit ruled that exit polling is a form of speech
protected by the First Amendment. It said the Washington law, which
prohibited exit polling within 300 feet of a voting place, violated
the Constitution and was not the least restrictive means of
guaranteeing decorum at the polls.

   Three Americans who court
officials said used names of U.S. officials to sell phony gold
certificates were convicted of fraud Thursday in their absence and
given prison terms of five to 12 years.
   Court officials said the men used names including that of
Secretary of State George Shultz to operate a company with a
claimed worth of up to $270 million and which sold investment
certificates for gold that did not exist.
   The trial was held at the court of Ras al-Khaimah, one of the
seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates.
   The court identified the men as Fredrick Gonzalez and Donald
Edward, sentenced to 12 years imprisonment each, and Larry Gazier,
who received a five-year prison term. The whereabouts of the
fugitives were not known and their hometowns not released.
   Officials said the other two members of the ring were Konisa
Maskerensi, an Indian, and Ahmed Zoghbur, an Arab, who were each
sentenced to a year in jail. The two are under arrest.
   The ring claimed to own the gold in Switzerland and United
States and sold the certificates in Western Europe. The fraud was
uncovered when they tried to sell more in the Emirates, court
officials said.

   Federal regulators want a photograph of a
deformed infant on the warning label of Accutane, a powerful
anti-acne medicine that can damage the fetuses of pregnant women, a
pharmaceutical company said Thursday.
   That and other U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements,
which are ``not written in concrete,'' an FDA spokesman said,
follow an FDA panel's recommendation last month that the drug
remain on the market.
   Hoffman-La Roche Inc. spokeswoman Carolyn R. Glynn said the
company is ``in agreement with'' the FDA's order, which does not
stray much from the advisory panel's recommendations on the
prescription drug, which was introduced in 1982.
   The company agrees that female patients should be shown the
infant deformities Accutane can cause, but the photo ``may be more
appropriate ... to use on the patient consent materials'' signed in
the doctor's office, she said.
   Those materials, planned for issue early this summer, would
include a form to be signed by female patients stating they
understand the risks associated with the drug, she said.
   Ms. Glynn said company officials previously discussed using such
a photograph, but not with the FDA or the advisory panel. ``It's
not an issue of using the picture, it's where you use the
picture,'' she said.
   The spokeswoman for the Nutley-based company said
Hoffman-LaRoche received the FDA's requirements in a letter dated
May 19, on Wednesday. She released the order Thursday afternoon.
   The FDA left it to Hoffman-La Roche to release the order or keep
it confidential, she said.
   ``But until we have the opportunity to review the letter we're
not in a position to say `Well, yes we agree with this' or `No, we
don't agree with that,''' she said.
   FDA spokesman William Grigg said that ``there's still some
negotiating room'' if the company wants to alter some of the
requirements from the FDA.
   ``The agency and the company are trying to emphasize that these
are not just minor birth defects that occur rarely, but that if a
woman does become pregnant ... the chances are very very high that
she will have a very grossly debilitated infant that probably can't
take care of itself as it grows up,'' Grigg said.
   The advisory panel and the FDA embraced a proposal by Roche to
sell Accutane only in a so-called blister package in which explicit
patient warnings _ including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a
red X drawn through it _ would be sealed in at the factory to make
sure the patient would see them.
   ``Everybody agrees that we have to minimize birth defects if the
drug is going to remain on the market,'' Grigg said.
   Ms. Glynn said the company, which must respond to the FDA's
letter within 15 days, hopes to have the patient consent kit on the
market by late June, and have the new blister packaging in drug
stores no later than September.
   Since its introduction in 1982, Accutane has carried specific
and explicit warnings that there is a high risk it will cause birth
defects if taken during pregnancy.
   Those warnings have been strengthened in recent years, but the
FDA grew concerned that too many women, and perhaps doctors, were
ignoring them.
   The advisory panel that convened in April concluded the benefits
of the drug _ the only one on the market that can cure the severe
scarring type of acne it is intended to treat _ outweighed the risk
of misuse.
   The FDA has received reports of 66 birth defects associated with
the drug since 1982. Forty-five of the defects were in the first
two years of the drug's use when warnings were less severe. There
have been 21 reports since 1985, when labelling cautions were
strengthened.

   The Senate, heading toward pre-summit approval
of the historic treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, voted
overwhelmingly Thursday to restrict a future president's power to
change the treaty's interpretation, but delayed a final vote on the
treaty until at least Friday.
   The 72-27 decision settled the last major issue before floor
action on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   The Senate later killed, 53-45, a Republican-backed amendment
which would essentially have reversed the earlier decision, and
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., angered that the
Senate had spent time revisiting the same issue, abandoned efforts
to finish action on the pact Thursday evening.
   ``If we're going to continue to have Mickey Mouse amendments
like this, the president is not going to have his treaty before he
leaves the summit,'' Byrd told the Senate shortly before it quit
for the evening.
   Byrd was angry because he said he felt the treaty interpretation
issue had been settled by the earlier amendment, adopted by the
72-27 margin. Byrd and other Democratic leaders had made victory on
the issue one of their major goals in the debate over the treaty.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., agreed with Byrd that
work on the treaty is likely to be finished Friday.
   The INF treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their Washington summit, requires
elimination within three years of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles
with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. It would result in the
elimination of 867 U.S. missiles in Europe and elimination of 1,752
Soviet missiles.
   Ratification is assured because it only requires 67 votes and 90
or more of the 100 senators are likely to vote for the pact,
according to Byrd and other senators.
   Approval would mean the treaty could be rushed to Moscow before
Reagan and Gorbachev meet Sunday at the summit. White House chief
of staff Howard Baker was standing by to carry the ratification
papers to Reagan.
   The pact will be the first ratified by the Senate since the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Also, it will be the first treaty to
actually require the destruction of weapons, rather than simply
slowing the build-up, and its far-reaching verification provisions
include the first on-site inspections allowed by either superpower.
   The Senate voted 96-0 approval Thursday of an amendment which
incorporates into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago by
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, dealing with weapons using ``futuristic'' technology
and clarifying on-site verification rules.
   The Senate has been working on the pact since last week, and the
last major hurdle was cleared Wednesday when Helms, the chief
critic, dropped his opposition.
   Byrd had scheduled a vote Thursday to halt the delaying tactics
used by Helms and other GOP conservatives, but that vote was set
aside when offstage negotiations reached the agreement permitting
the final vote.
   The main unresolved issue didn't affect the INF treaty, but it
involved a long-running fight between the White House and the
Democratic-controlled Congress over the issue involving the
constitutional authority to interpret treaties.
   The amendment approved Thursday requires Senate approval if any
future president tries to reinterpret the treaty.
   The fight arose from Reagan's assertion that he has the legal
authority to unilaterally reinterpret the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to permit expanded tests of his Star Wars anti-missile
defense.
   Congressional Democrats have disputed that claim and argue that
their amendment to the INF pact is an attempt to preserve the
Senate's constitutional power to advise and consent on treaties.
But critics say the amendment would unfairly restrict a president.
   Byrd told his colleagues Thursday that accepting the
administration's claim to having unilateral power to reinterpret
treaties ``would reduce the constitutional role of the Senate to a
mere nullity. The consent of the Senate would be reduced to a
clerical function.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
agreed with Byrd, saying, ``We would be ill-served by that kind of
process and our foreign policy would be damaged severely.''
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the amendment ``holds a
switchblade knife at the United States'' because it imposed a
standard on the United States not imposed on the Soviet Union.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., called the amendment ``palpably
ridiculous, a dereliction of duty'' and said it would put the
Senate on record as asserting authority he contended it did not
possess under the Constitution.
   Ratification would cap an 11-year fight which began with the
1977 deployment by the Soviet Union of SS-20 missiles, a
triple-warhead weapon which was used to replace the Soviets' older
SS-4 and SS-5 missiles.
   The first major alarm was raised in October, 1977, when Helmut
Schmidt, then chancellor of West Germany, warned in a London speech
that the SS-20s were a serious threat to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   In response, NATO began discussing deployment of new
atomic-tipped weapons. Those discussions culminated in the Dec. 13,
1979 decision by NATO to adopt what became known as the
``two-track'' decision. That involved the dual decision to both
pursue arms negotiations at the same time new U.S. atomic weapons
were being installed.
   NATO decided that four years later, beginning in late 1983, it
would deploy 572 new U.S. atomic weapons, including 108 Pershing
IIs which would be stationed in West Germany, and another 464
ground-launched cruise missiles for deployment in Britain, Italy,
West Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Late in 1981, Reagan announced that his administration was
adopting the so-called ``zero option'' as its position in the INF
talks. The U.S. plan, which originated with West German
politicians, called for halting the planned U.S. deployments if the
Soviets withdrew their SS-20s. Administration critics said the U.S.
plan was unrealistic.
   In 1982, Paul Nitze, the top U.S. negotiator, and his Soviet
counterpart, Yuli Kvitsinsky, agreed privately on a formula for a
proposed INF agreement. It became known as the ``walk in the
woods,'' but it was rejected by both the U.S. and Soviet
governments.
   The NATO deployments started in November 1983, in West Germany,
and the Soviets responded by walking out of the INF talks.
   The negotiations resumed in the spring of 1985, after Gorbachev
took over power.

   President Kenneth Kaunda accused
Western governments Thursday of not doing enough to fight apartheid
as he opened the annual summit of the Organization of African Unity.
   ``Inside South Africa, the racist regime has made efforts to
intensify its acts of oppression,'' he told 30 African heads of
state attending the summit, which marked the organization's 25th
anniversary. ``Many people are still being killed, maimed or
imprisoned.
   ``How is it possible for major Western countries to claim that
they must deal with the racist regime because sanctions don't
work?'' he asked, pausing to wipe tears from his eyes.
   ``Am I to conclude that the reason they acted against Hitler is
that those who died were white people?'' said Kaunda, the outgoing
OAU chairman. ``If so, what conclusion am I going to make that they
are not prepared to act against the new Hitler, (President P.W.)
Botha, in South Africa?''
   He said Africa's struggle had never been ``and will never be
anti-white, it will always be anti-apartheid.''
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said in a message to the
OAU that the United States abhors ``the ugly system of apartheid''
and is commited to helping South Africa become a democratic society.
   Shultz said he would have attended the meeting, but the date
conflicted with this week's superpower summit. Kenneth Brown, a
deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs, went
instead.
   Kaunda thanked the U.S. Congress for imposing limited sanctions
on Pretoria and expressed gratitude to American church leaders and
students for supporting anti-apartheid efforts.
   He also thanked people in Britain, West Germany and France ``who
against their governments are supporting our cause,'' and the
Nordic countries.
   The OAU has frequently denounced South Africa and demanded that
Western governments impose mandatory sanctions against the
white-led government. At the same time, black Africa does about $1
billion a year in business with South Africa, much of it covertly.
   Mali's president, Gen. Moussa Traore, was elected Thursday to
succeed Kaunda in the chairman post, which switches every year
between representatives of northern and sub-Saharan Africa.
   Traore urged the OAU to ``further improve our methods of
struggle so as to fully dismantle apartheid and increase moral and
material support to the peoples of south Africa, Namibia and the
frontline states.''
   Traore said OAU efforts to end the Libya-Chad dispute were
``clear evidence of the ability of Africa to transcend its
differences.''
   Kaunda mediated a cease-fire between the North African nations
in September. On Wednesday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi told
reporters in Tripoli that he had declared an end to the 15-year-old
war in honor of the OAU's 25th anniversary.
   President Hissene Habre of Chad, attending the summit, expressed
``cautious optimism'' about Gadhafi's overture.
   Traore also praised Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam and
Somalia's president, Mohamed Siad Barre, for their resumption of
diplomatic ties last month after an 11-year break prompted by their
desert war.
   By law and custom in South Africa, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the country's 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

   South Africa and Mozambique agreed
Wednesday to resume security meetings that lapsed three years ago
when relations between the two countries deteriorated.
   A meeting between the two countries on Wednesday included
ranking diplomats and military officials and was the latest
indication that hostilities were easing.
   The two sides said in a statement that they would resume
meetings of a joint security commission ``at the earliest possible
date.'' The commission was set up in line with the 1984 Nkomati
Accord, a mutual non-aggression treaty in which each country
pledged to halt support for guerrillas fighting against the other
government.
   The commission has been defunct since 1985, when Mozambique
found documents indicating that South Africa was still aiding
Mozambican rebels despite the treaty.
   Since then, Mozambique has persistently accused South Africa of
continued covert aid to the Mozambique National Resistance rebel
movement. South Africa denies it.
   The war has devastated Mozambique's economy and is the main
cause of a famine that has left almost 6 million of the country's
14.5 million people in need of food aid.
   ``The two delegations affirmed the commitments of their
respective governments not to support the commission of violence
against the peoples of their respective countries,'' the statement
said.
   The army commander, Lt. Gen. Tobais Dai, led Mozambique's
delegation at Wednesday's talks. South Africa's delegation was
headed by the director-general of the Foreign Affairs Department,
Niel Van Heerden, and included the army chief, Lt. Gen. A.J.
Liebenberg.

   A British minister on Wednesday said it
was unlikely that a multinational U.N. force would be created to
escort commercial vessels through the Persian Gulf.
   At a news conference, Ian Stewart, minister of state for the
armed forces, praised cooperation among Western naval task forces
in the waterway, where Iran and Iraq are at war.
   But, when asked about the chances of implementing a Soviet
proposal for the creation of a U.N.-sponsored force to replace the
individual contingents in the gulf, he said: ``We don't see it as
an immediate possibility at all.''
   The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Italy,
Belgium and the Netherlands have forces in the gulf to protect
ships bearing their national flags and to destroy mines.
   ``It sounds attractive in theory but it would be very difficult
to put ... together in practical terms,'' Stewart said. ``There has
never been a U.N. naval task force of that kind and certainly not
when two parties are still actively at war.''
   Stewart met earlier Wednesday with Crown Prince Sheik Hamad bin
Isa Al-Khalifa, commander of the Bahrain Defense Force.
   The British minister said countries in the region have been
``very helpful'' in efforts to limit the effects of the 7{-year-old
war on shipping lanes of the oil-rich region.
   Stewart said there have been ``less hostilities and less
activities at sea than would probably have been the case before''
the foreign navies sent forces to the gulf.
   Iran attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for Iraqi raids on
its shipping lanes. Iran also has been blamed for sowing mines in
the waterway.
   Earlier this month, Washington expanded the duties of its naval
task force, allowing the warships to intervene in attacks on
neutral vessels even if they were not flying American flags.
   Steward welcomed the U.S. decision, but would not say if Britain
will follow suit.
   So far, Iran has not attacked vessels under any military escort.
   One of the British warships, the frigate HMS Beaver, is on a
port call in Bahrain. Stewart was scheduled to inspect it and to
visit other gulf countries.

   A utility company today tentatively agreed

deal is finalized, it would be the first time a completed U.S.
atomic plant was abandoned before it opened.
   The agreement between the state and the Long Island Lighting Co.

   It would allow financially troubled LILCO to continue to operate
as a privately owned utility. The state had been proceeding with a
possible takeover of the entire company.

   A catastrophic health insurance bill providing

has cleared a major legislative hurdle.
   The compromise agreed to late Wednesday by a House-Senate

but that is a foregone conclusion given the broad support that the
basic measure received last year when it cleared the two houses in

   Catholic educators, still facing a retreat
in parochial school enrollments, are looking toward a future in
which religious education programs outside school loom even larger.
   Indeed, at a week-long symposium on the future of Catholic
education that ends today, most of the discussion centered on
programs that reach out to children and adults outside the
traditional school structure.
   There was virtually no debate at the Catholic Education Futures
Project sessions about how to stem the erosion of parochial
schools, which lost 110 more schools and 103,000 students last year
alone. There are now 2.6 million students in 8,992 Catholic
schools, down from a peak of 5.6 million in more than 13,000
schools in 1964.

   Seismic technology is sensitive enough to
confidently monitor all but the smallest Soviet underground nuclear
tests, a congressional scientific study said Thursday.
   The conclusions could help to reach a ban on all underground
testing, one of the unresolved issues between the two superpowers,
said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee. He called the study ``an important
contribution'' to the effort to develop a test ban.
   The study, carried out by the Office of Technology Assessment,
an arm of Congress, was released as President Reagan rested in
Helsinki, Finland, while en route to the Soviet Union to meet with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

   The U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly rapid

than previously believed, because of the biggest decline in the
trade deficit in eight years, the government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, was propelled during the first
three months of the year by an export surge, a rebound in car sales
and a boom in business capital investment.

estimate made a month ago that the GNP grew at a more modest 2.3

   Rust, now 20, was sentenced Sept. 4 to four years at a

<HEAD>Raisa's High Profile Played Down by Soviet Media</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   MOSCOW ( AP) - Raisa Maximovna Gorbachev, who charms the Western
press on her trips abroad, is given far less attention on her own
turf by a Soviet media that plays down the high profile of its
first lady.
   The poised, tastefully dressed and alternately demure and
gregarious wife of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has made
several public appearances in the last few months.
   She attended May Day celebrations, where she stood at the edge
of Red Square chatting with her daughter, Irina, a physician in her
30s, and with wives of other party and state dignitaries.
   Earlier this month, she attended a Moscow performance of the
Dance Theater of Harlem. Within the last few months she has been
shown briefly on Vremya, the state-controlled television station's
evening newscast, viewing Western art exhibits.
   But the auburn-haired Mrs. Gorbachev is seldom seen in shouted
exchanges similar to those between Nancy Reagan and the White House
press corps.
   Although Mrs. Gorbachev generally seems amenable to questions
from the foreign press, similar chats rarely occur with Soviet
reporters, who have no tradition of reporting on their first lady.
   In Yugoslavia earlier this year, when American reporters wanted
to talk with her, she sought out a Yugoslavian journalist and told
him to ask a question before she would respond to others.
   Like Gorbachev himself, the Soviet first lady has become
somewhat controversial.
   ``The Soviet people do not believe that wives should influence a
leader politically,'' said a 34-year-old teacher. ``They are not
used to it. And they ask, `why should she influence affairs of our
country?'''
   Mrs. Gorbachev appears to serve as an unofficial adviser to her
husband in a manner similar to former first lady Rosalynn Carter.
But the extent to which she discusses policy with her husband is
unknown among the Soviet people.
   When Soviet television broadcast Gorbachev's interview with NBC
anchorman Tom Brokaw in early December, it censored the Soviet
leader's comment that he discusses ``everything,'' including Soviet
affairs at the highest level, with his wife.
   The reference to Mrs. Gorbachev's role as unofficial adviser to
her husband was the only portion of the interview not broadcast to
viewers, indicating just how sensitive her high profile has become.
   Foreign dignitaries who have met the 56-year-old Mrs. Gorbachev
describe her as well-informed on international and domestic
affairs. But her knowledge of political affairs is not flawless, as
revealed during her Washington visit in early December for the
superpower summit.
   When talking with a group of Armenians who had emigrated to
America, Mrs. Gorbachev told them the Soviet Union has always had a
good relationship with Armenia. Armenia is one of 15 Soviet
republics and, therefore, its people are Soviet citizens.
   Mrs. Gorbachev is frequently seen at her husband's side when he
travels around the Soviet Union, and she has accompanied him on all
of his trips abroad.
   Mrs. Gorbachev has been active in promoting an exchange of
fashion and design ideas with Western firms and holds an official
position as a member of the Soviet Cultural Fund.
   Her wardrobe is smart and varied and has been supplemented by
gifts from Paris couturiers during the couple's official visit to
France in 1985. She is seldom seen in the same outfit twice when
the average Soviet woman usually has no more than three or four
changes of clothes to wear to work.
   Last year on a visit to Prague, she was shown leaving Moscow
wearing a fur hat and coat. But Soviet television also ran pictures
of the Gorbachevs' arrival, revealing that Mrs. Gorbachev had
changed in flight into a cloche cap and wool coat.
   Raisa Maximovna Titorenko was born on Jan. 5, 1932. She and
Gorbachev met at the boarding house where both lived as students at
Moscow State University. She studied sociology, while he studied
law. They moved to Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern
Russia when he graduated in 1955.
   Mrs. Gorbachev took a job as lecturer at her alma mater when her
husband, by then a rising party official, returned to Moscow. She
gave up her job when Gorbachev became Communist Party chief.
   The Gorbachev's have one daughter and two granddaughters.

<HEAD>Money Market Funds Not All The Same</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the climate of uncertainty that has prevailed
since the stock market crash last fall, many savers and investors
have opted for the safe harbor of money market mutual funds.
   It is easy to think of money funds as a kind of generic,
one-size-fits-all product, since all of them do pretty much the
same thing _ investing in short-term, interest-bearing securities
for a respectable yield with safety and liquidity.
   Their net asset values are kept constant, leaving no price
performance comparisons to differentiate among them.
   Thus, many people don't devote great amounts of time and energy
to choosing a particular fund, but rather go with whichever one is
handiest, commonly at a brokerage firm or mutual fund group with
which they already have dealings.
   Convenience is indeed an important consideration in picking a
money fund. And most financial advisers agree that money funds as a
group are very safe investments, even though they lack the federal
insurance that banks and savings institutions can offer on deposits.
   Still, students of the subject say there can be significant
differences between funds that are worth heeding, in order to
maximize both your financial return and your peace of mind.
   In a mid-May tabulation of 322 funds that invest in taxable
securities, Donoghue's Money Fund Report put their average annual
yield, based on the results of the most recent seven days and
including the effects of compounding, at 6.47 percent.
   Among the individual funds, the yields ranged from 5.7 percent
to 7.2 percent.
   Such a variance doesn't mean much to someone investing just
$1,000 or $2,000. With more substantial sums, however, it starts to
add up.
   Why would one fund yield a good deal more than the other? One
common explanation lies in differing investment philosophies.
   An aggressive fund management might stretch its yield by
concentrating on securities considered a little more risky than
Treasury bills _ for example, commercial paper issued by
corporations with credit ratings a shade or two below the top.
   A large number of more conservative funds confine themselves
exclusively to U.S. government securities that are guaranteed by
the government against default, sacrificing a bit in yield for the
sake of an extra measure of safety.
   In addition, a fund can seek an enhanced yield by lengthening
the maturity of the securities it owns. In theory at least, longer
maturities should carry at least slightly higher yields because of
the increased risk they represent.
   Among the funds tracked by the Donoghue organization, average
maturities recently ranged from one to 81 days.
   While such considerations tend to justify yield differences
between funds, says Norman Fosback, editor of the advisory letter
Income & Safety, they by no means account for all of those
differences.
   ``The majority of the yield differential is due to varying
expense ratios,'' he says.
   Fosback cited a recent Donoghue survey that found high-yielding
funds running expenses that effectively lowered their return to
investors by half a percentage point. The lowest-yielding funds, by
contrast, had expenses to the tune of 1.2 percentage points.
   That's just the opposite of the way things should ideally work.
A fund that costs more to operate should earn its keep by producing
superior results.
   The message, as summarized by Sheldon Jacobs in his Handbook For
No-Load Fund Investors: ``Avoid high expense ratio funds. A high
expense ratio almost always means a lower net yield to you.''

   America's marketplace has become so marked by
irrational ups and downs, especially for financial products such as
stock and bonds, that it has been said in jest that it should be
institutionalized.
   That, of course, is one of the problems. Trading by
institutions, not of the mental sort as suggested by the jest, but
mutual funds, pension funds and the like, have come to dominate the
marketplace.
   Not only are they large, but often they think and act alike,
producing a combination that can change the market's direction on
what might otherwise seem to be insignificant news. In a sense, the
market can trip over a pebble.
   However, institutions are probably but one of several reasons
for the frenzies, fads, flipflops and phobias that seem to grip the
market. Technology, financial journalism, economic uncertainty and
internationalization also are factors.
   That is the contention of economist John Tuccillo who, though
his specialty is real estate _ he is National Association of
Realtors senior vice president _ has produced one of the most
cogent explanations of current market behavior.
   In the past, he states, panics occurred infrequently. From 1907
to 1929, for example, there was almost nothing to rate the
designation. Now, we see big changes in stocks, interest rates,
currency values and more on a weekly basis.
   In explanation, he cites five factors:
   _Big block trading. Stock and bond price indexes are weighted
averages of daily trades, and they are watched closely by mutual
and pension funds and other big institutional players.
   Since institutions, as opposed to individuals, now dominate the
market, even slight changes in indexes can causes a great deal of
weight to be thrown around, simply because of the size of the
trades.
   _Computerization has given even more weight to the activities of
these large traders, most of whom use computers to signal the
proper time to buy and sell.
   The problem, says Tuccillo, is that ``all the programs give off
the same signals.'' When the market moves, ``technology will give
it a further momentum,'' turning what might have been small swings
into avalanches.
   _With the proliferation of financial television shows and
newspapers there has been increasing competition for stories.
   ``So, just as TV news has made stars of tin-horn felons and
obscure rebellions, TV financial news has made stars out of
statistics and even (ugh!) economists.''
   Should traders care about the monthly trade numbers? No, says
Tuccillo. ``Monthly numbers are unreliable and the true picture is
shown only annually.'' Do they care? ``Probably a lot.'' Why? ``The
financial media tell them to.''
   ``The result is a jittery market that hangs on the arithmetic of
obscure bureaucrats.''
   _The crash of October 1987 so shattered confidence that most
players don't know what to believe.
   ``Hence, they soar on a `good' numbers and crash on a `bad' one.
And it doesn't help that the media produce reams of instant
analysis.''
   _Internationalization. Financial markets now trade around the
clock. What happens in Tokyo and London affects markets in the
United States and on again around the globe until cause and effect
are obscured.
   ``As the players increase in number ... the risk of strong
movement increases.''
   Tuccillo's conclusion and advice:
   ``The economy in 1988, although weaker than last year, is
growing in an atmosphere of steady (interest) rates and low
inflation. So, when rates run up, hold tight and ride out the
four-to six-week frenzy.''

<HEAD>Euterpe Dukakis: Greek Emigre to School Teacher to Presidential
Campaigner</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Michael Dukakis was 17, he borrowed
his mother's new convertible on a school night and smashed one of
the lights trying to negotiate his way out of a gas station.
   True to his super-straight image, the teen-ager went home and
waited for hours for his mother and father to return home to tell
them of the mishap.
   ``He couldn't go to sleep, he couldn't go to bed without first
telling me,'' recalls his mother, 84-year-old Euterpe Boukis
Dukakis.
   There are no negatives in her assessment of the politician whose
first bid for office ended in the presidency _ of his third-grade
class.
   When asked what her strongest criticism of her son would be, she
scolded a reporter, ``That's a terrible thing to ask a mother.''
   She even insists that he is not as humorless as many people seem
to think.
   ``Campaigning (is) serious business and he cannot be a
jokester,'' said Mrs. Dukakis. ``When we are together, in
gatherings with family, friends, parties, he's just jovial.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, dressed in a blue sweater buttoned to the neck and
a neatly pressed blue-green plaid skirt, sat straight in her arm
chair during an interview and grudgingly held a high school
photograph of her son at the request of a photographer.
   ``That would be too sentimental,'' she said of the pose.
   Many photos of her late husband, Panos, and her son's family can
be found in almost every room of her home. In the living room, a
small teddy-bear with a miniature ``Dukakis for President'' T-shirt
is seated on a rocking chair. Mother and son remain very close,
despite his exhausting schedule.
   ``He calls his mother every other day. He called me this morning
to tell me what the plans are for the week,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
``We don't see each other as much as we used to, but he never
forgets.''
   The likely Democratic nominee for president rarely fails to
mention his immigrant parents in his campaign speeches.
   Panos, his father, came to America speaking little English when
he was just 15 and worked in the mills to put himself through Bates
College in Maine.
   After only eight years in the country, he went to Harvard
Medical School and became a successful obstetrician. He died in
1979.
   The candidate's mother emigrated from Larissa, Greece, at age 9
and worked with her family in the textile factories in Haverhill.
   In 1921 she became the first girl of about 3,000 Greeks from her
hometown to go to college. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Bates
and taught English and history in Ashland, N.H., and Amesbury
schools.
   ``Michael is so proud of that fact,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
   Despite her age, Mrs. Dukakis has made many campaign appearances
on her son's behalf.
   Last December, for example, when Dukakis was tied up with
gubernatorial duties, she went to New Hampshire to officially
register her son for the state's first-in-the-nation primary.
   ``I love it, it's very interesting. This has been a wonderful
opportunity for me to get to know the country,'' she said.
   Asked point blank why her son should be president, Euterpe said,
``His strength of character. He will always obey the law, which our
present administration hasn't done at all. They've been conniving,
they've been underhanded, and Michael would never do that.''
   She also said her son's family would set a good role model for
the nation.
   ``Because we grew in an ethnic family we kept the old values of
discipline, of respect for older people, of family closeness,'' she
said.
   ``What a wonderful role model Michael and Kitty and the family,
a close family, a loving family (would be) in contrast to what we
have now,'' she said.
   Euterpe said that family tradition includes a sense of duty and
discipline.
   When Michael and his older brother Stelian _ who struggled with
mental problems and died after being struck by a car while riding
his bike in 1973 _ were growing up, they never received allowances
for household chores like the other children in the neighborhood.
   ``We are all members of the family, we don't pay each other for
what we do for each other,'' said the governor's mother.

<HEAD>Liza Minnelli in Unusual Variety Special on ABC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been 16 years since Liza Minnelli's had a
special on network television, and it took an unusual idea to get
her onto the small screen for ``Liza Minnelli: Triple Play'' on ABC
next Tuesday.
   ``They (ABC) ask me every year. This year I think we shocked
them because we said `yes.' It took me since 1972 to think of
something different,'' Minnelli said recently on a shooting break.
   ``The last special that was my own was in 1972. I was in
`Baryshnikov on Broadway' and `Goldie and Liza Together,' not my
own.
   ``I got tired of `in concert.' `Liza with a Z' was the first
in-concert special. Then everybody else did them.''
   The one-hour special will air next Tuesday. Minnelli's co-stars
are John Rubinstein, Louis Gossett Jr. and Ryan O'Neal.
   ``The best thing about it is not having to perform alone,''
Minnelli said, ``not going out there, singing your songs and going
home. You get to the point where the joy is working with other
people. That's where the real kick is and the challenge, too. I'm
working with people I admire and hadn't had a chance to work with
before.''
   Songwriter Fred Ebb had the idea that made Minnelli say ``yes''
this time. The same four-line dialogue to begin a short play was
given to three sets of writers _ Lanford Wilson, Terrence McNally
with Wendy Wasserstein, and Ebb and his partner John Kander.
   Wilson wrote a drama, McNally and Wasserstein a romantic fantasy
and Kander and Ebb a musical.
   Minnelli has worked with Kander and Ebb a lot and was in the
1984 Broadway musical ``The Rink,'' with book by McNally.
   ``We got the writers we wanted, first crack out of the box,''
she said. ``We were really thrilled.
   ``We didn't know what they were writing. We hired the best and
trusted them.''
   Minnelli got British director Piers Haggard whom she hadn't
worked with before but admired. ``Martin Scorsese one day showed me
two episodes of the original British TV version of `Pennies from
Heaven' that Piers directed. It was brilliant,'' she said. ``When I
went to London in 1983 I looked him up. Calling strangers is
something I'm not wont to do, but I was in such admiration of this
man.
   ``I've kept looking for things to do with him. This is just
perfect. He has understood the different styles and made this work,
within our budget.''
   The scenes shot the day of the interview take place in a parlor
complete with Tiffany lamps. Stand-ins walked through, while
minions with tape measures and light meters announced measurements
to adjusters of light reflectors.
   Then Minnelli and Rubinstein rehearsed moving from chair to
settee. Haggard had them repeat it slower. Minnelli asked that her
chair cushion be higher and two blankets were folded under it. She
thanked the woman who handed her the high-heeled shoes that she
donned for the scene's three takes.
   Minnelli won't be watching her ``Triple Play.'' As soon as
shooting ended, she and her husband, Mark Gero, left for a European
vacation. She has accepted an invitation from Frank Sinatra and
Sammy Davis to replace Dean Martin in six weeks of concerts next
fall.
   Meanwhile, she said, she needed the vacation because of the
grueling schedule of the TV special.
   ``We work from 6 in the morning to 8 at night, then go home and
faint. But I'm healthy and enjoying it. A lot of it is making sure
when I'm working I get plenty of sleep.
   ``There's a basic tension in the air,'' she said. ``I think the
writers have done some really gutsy stuff that hasn't been seen.
It's not just nice, safe, sitcom stuff. It is about interesting
things. We'll see how it goes over. ``I think we're taking some
chances, some risks. Anytime you try to do that, it's a little
anxious, a little nervous.''

<HEAD>Mystery Oil Spills Endanger Ecology of Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA SMILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil that made the Persian Gulf rich
now is fouling it.
   Environmental experts say oil pollution has never been worse,
and while they regard it as an indirect result of the 7{-year-old
war between Iraq and Iran, the actual source remains unknown.
   ``Nobody can do anything until the war is stopped, because it is
too difficult to find the sources of the leakage,'' said Jassim
Ahmed Al-Qaseer, acting director of fisheries in this island state.
   Iran, however, has reported what it called an ``unprececented''
oil slick in the Stait of Hormuz in the southern gulf and said it
resulted from an Iraqi air raid on the Larak offshore oil terminal
in the area.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an official of Iran's
Environment Protection Organization as saying thousands of fish
have died and that the livelihood of local fishermen is endangered.
   Walt Vreeland, an American adviser to the Bahrain-based
Environmental Protection Committee, said the war restricts scouting
of the gulf for signs of oil pollution.
   ``We're very limited as to how far we can go out,'' said
Vreeland, a native of Bucks County, Pa. ``Bahrain's territorial
waters are 12 miles, and to be quite honest about it, I'm not going
to go 50 miles in a helicopter. No way.''
   Vreeland said in an interview that Bahrain, which is about
halfway up the 600-mile-long gulf, is among the hardest-hit areas,
at a time when it is trying to attract tourists to its beaches.
   ``The main thing you'll find are aesthetic problems. People just
don't want to go to the beach because it's a mess down there,''
Vreeland added. ``The other indirect effects would be reduction of
fish, of sea grass beds. These are not areas you would expect to
see immediate effects.''
   Cleanup efforts already are under way on Bahrain's beaches, but
the oil remains in the water.
   ``I could see tar and tarballs all around. And when I saw the
windsurfing boards, they had all turned black from the tar,'' said
a foreign resident, Ikuko Waki.
   Oil pollution is not new to the gulf, where wells on shore and
underwater produce nearly a fifth of the industrial world's
petroleum. In the past, however, the gulf could handle the
occasional oil spill.
   Extremely shallow along the coasts and about 300 feet at its
deepest, the gulf is fed from the north by the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers.
   Naturally cycled every two years, the water flows out through
the Strait of Hormuz, a passage so narrow as to prevent a large
volume of water exchange between the gulf and the Arabian Sea.
   ``You have to realize we're dealing with an oil spill of unknown
source, of unknown size, of unknown duration,'' said Vreeland. ``We
don't know where it's coming from, we don't know how much is coming
in. It's very widespread.''
   Observers say more clumps of oil are floating in the southern
gulf than at any time in the past year. Gulf-based shipping
executives believe some is from three Iranian oil platforms wrecked
by the U.S. Navy in recent reprisal attacks. Vreeland says it isn't
known if they are leaking oil.
   Another suspected source is Iran's big Kharg Island oil terminal
in the northern gulf. It has been attacked by Iraqi planes several
times, but Iran has never reported on damage.
   Al-Qaseer says pollution threatens a commercial fishing
industry, already affected by the war. South-flowing currents help
to keep northern waters clean, but ``fishermen are afraid to go
there'' because of the fighting, he said.
   Vreeland said that even after the disappearance of light
fractions of the oil, which are most toxic to marine life, the
heavy residue collects dirt and debris and sinks to the seabed,
affecting some sea life.
   As scientists analyze oil samples in a search for the source,
public concern is growing. Gulf-area newspapers give wide coverage
to the prpblem, and environmental groups meet regularly.
   ``It's going to destroy the shoreline, destroy some of the
beaches, some of the rocky shores,'' Vreeland said.
   Nor is the threat short-term, he said.
   ``I foresee this happening again and again, and until the
Iraq-Iran war stops, until we can get surveillance out and actually
watch what's going on, there's nothing we can do about it.''

   Of the three countries taken by the communists

   The communist leaders of remote Laos are
loosening their grip on the country in a local version of the
Kremlin's sweeping reforms.
   Under the banner of the ``New Economic Mechanism,'' ownership
and inheritance of private property have been newly sanctioned, a
code encouraging investment from the capitalist world has been
passed, and plans are under way to cut by one-third a bureaucracy
that controlled the lives of Laos' 3.9 million citizens.
   Although still a one-party state wary of political dissidents
and run by some of the world's most durable revolutionaries, Laos
may go farther in liberalizing its economy than neighboring Vietnam
and a number of other communist countries, according to Western
diplomats stationed here.
   ``People are beginning to smile again,'' said one European who
has known the country for decades.
   While state co-operatives do exist, bonuses and other incentives
have been introduced, and several purportedly socialist enterprises
visited appeared to have the loosest kind of structure.
   ``Go see what we have in the co-operative store, then come back
and buy from me,'' said a friendly old woman trying to sell
hand-woven cloth to visiting Western journalists.
   Although still quiet and slow-paced by most measurements,
striking changes are apparent in Vientiane, the capital city of
250,000.
   The tailors and jewelers along Samsenthai, the city's main
commercial street, are back in business, as are the dance halls
where women in sarongs and their partners alternate between
traditional ``ramwong'' music and semi-hard rock.
   Unthinkable a few years ago, Laotian women now dance with
foreigners at some clubs. Teen-agers wear longish hair and Western
fashions, which in the early days of communist rule was enough to
have them branded as ``decadent hippies'' and sent off to
re-education camps.
   At the city's sprawling central market, U.S. dollars, Thai baht
and the local kip currency are all legally used to buy Japanese
television sets, Thai-made ``designer'' clothes, European liquor
and a wide variety of local farm produce. The newly remodeled
market is on lease for 10 years to Thai businessmen who share
profits with the government.
   Economically booming Thailand next door is the source of most
consumer goods, which are traded or smuggled across the Mekong
River frontier. Local purchasing power is fueled by some $3 million
to $5 million yearly sent home to relatives by refugees in the
United States, France and elsewhere.
   ``Business is getting better every day,'' said Virachit
Philaphandeth, one of a growing number of enterpreneurs whose
monthly 300,000 kip ($850) in net profit is about 50 times the wage
of a middle-ranked government official.
   Virachit, whose ventures include a lumber mill, said growing
confidence in the New Economic Mechanism is leading to more
domestic investment and a mini-boom in private home-building, which
is evident in Vientiane and other areas of Laos.
   The new policies, the diplomats agree, have been influenced by
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet
Union, as well as by reforms in neighboring China and Vietnam, and
by television programs, avidly watched here, from robustly
capitalist, pro-Western Thailand.
   The reforms are also apparent reactions to the period between
the communist victory in 1975 and about 1980, when the regime
attempted to collectivize peasants, flirted with inappropriate
industrial projects and attempted lifestyle changes antithetical to
the basic Laotian character and traditions.
   The economy stagnated. An estimated 350,000 people, including a
bulk of Vientiane's skilled middle class, fled the country and
adherents of the toppled, U.S.-backed government were sent to harsh
re-education camps. An insurgency flickered.
   Although Laos did not suffer the postwar traumas of its
Indochinese neighbors, Cambodia and Vietnam, neither was the
transition a ``Song and Dance Revolution'' as some observers
claimed.
   ``There is no philosophy which must be followed from here to
eternity,'' a key economic planner, Somphavanh Inthavong, said in
an interview. He explained that slowly evolving reforms were
formally approved at the communist party's Fourth Congress in
December 1986 and have gained steady momentum over the past year.
   Whatever changes the economic loosening may bring to the
political arena, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, as the
communist party is called, currently shows few signs of relaxing
its grip on power or dismantling a watchdog apparatus which
penetrates to the grassroots.
   The country's first national elections since 1975 are scheduled
for mid-November following balloting at district levels. Officials
say there will be more candidates than the 79 seats in the Supreme
People's Assembly but all will be screened before being allowed to
run.
   The major tasks of this and next year will be to finish the
draft of a constitution _ the first under comunist rule _ and to
substitute a legal system for the decrees under which the country
has been run since the end of the Indochina war in 1975.
   Widely seen as the architect of change is Kaysone Phomvihan, the
68-year-old leader who is one of the longest power-holders in the
communist world. He has headed the party since 1955.
   Although long regarded as a conservative, Kaysone has sharply
criticized the system's shortcomings and opened some doors.
   Western diplomats say the bulk of re-education camp inmates have
been released. Laotians are being permitted to visit refugee
relatives abroad and Buddhism appears to be well tolerated.
Although entry into Laos is still difficult, more Western
journalists have been allowed to visit the country in recent months.
   Laos is closely bound to Vietnam and the Soviet Union, but
United Nations statistics show that unlike a few years ago about 60
percent of the $100 million that Laos annually receives in economic
aid is now coming from the non-communist world, notably Japan,
Sweden and Australia.
   Souphavanh, the economic planner, said the main socio-economic
thrust will be to uplift the more than 3 million poor, subsistance
farmers, including large numbers of ethnic minorities, in the
rugged countryside.
   Few roads penetrate the provinces, electricity is rare and
diseases rampant, with the infant mortality rate at 120 to 130 per
1,000 births, among the highest in the world.
   Officials indicate that a key measure of the new economic
policy's success will be its effectiveness in spreading the
relative prosperity now being enjoyed in Vientiane and the lowlands
bordering Thailand.

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev,
allied perhaps only in the desire to help their husbands succeed at
the Moscow summit, are expected to suppress their much-touted
rivalry in the interest of a smooth session.
   But gossip-hungry summit watchers will be alert for any hint of
a new round in the purported superpower catfight, be it an archly
raised eyebrow from Mrs. Reagan or an extended lecture to the U.S.
press corps from Mrs. Gorbachev.
   The two women have scheduled their first get-together for Sunday
afternoon, as President Reagan and Soviet Communist Party General
Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev face off for the first time over a
Kremlin negotiating table.
   Soviet experts predict the two women will strive to put aside
their differences and display goodwill at a summit that may prove
to be more show than substance.
   ``I suspect ... they both want to make sure that they don't get
in the way and that they don't become part of the story in a
negative sense,'' said Ed Hewett, a specialist in Soviet studies
and a senior analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   Even though both women pooh-poohed the idea that they engaged in
any form of competition at last December's summit, former White
House chief of staff Donald Regan offered a behind-the-scenes peek
at their relationship in his book, ``For the Record.''
   Regan writes that Mrs. Reagan was peeved at the front-page
attention garnered by Mrs. Gorbachev's outspoken and fashionable
style during the first U.S.-Soviet summit in Geneva in 1985.
   Irritated by Mrs. Gorbachev's extensive conversation at their
first dinner, Mrs. Reagan sniffed afterwards, ``Who does that dame
think she is?'' Regan wrote.
   The former chief of staff also disclosed Mrs. Reagan's
predeliction for star-gazing in his book, a subject that Mrs.
Reagan so far has not addressed or been questioned about and one
that could dominate her early encounters with the media here.
   Mrs. Reagan is described privately by associates and White House
aides as determined to try to squelch reports of any renewed
disputes with Gorbachev's wife during this meeting.
   Mrs. Reagan ``has always been a gracious hostess and has always
been a courteous guest,'' said Shiela Tate, Mrs. Reagan's former
press secretary. ``You'll see that she will be this time, too.''
   Ms. Tate, a public relations executive with Hill & Knowlton,
said the first lady has always seen her role as an extension of the
diplomatic process.
   ``She cares a lot about how she represents this country and so
she'll do her best,'' said Ms. Tate.
   It turns out the two women will be spending a good deal of time
together in Moscow.
   Besides the visit to the Kremlin Cathedral of the Assumption,
they are scheduled to tour the Tretyakov art gallery later in the
week.
   The president and Mrs. Reagan will see their counterparts at the
welcoming and departure ceremonies, as well as the Kremlin state
dinner and the U.S. reciprocal dinner held at the ambassador's
residence, Spaso House.
   The most lengthy and private encounter between the couples will
come after they attend a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet _ the
Gorbachevs have invited them to dinner at a private country house,
or dacha, outside the city.
   But it is unclear whether reporters will have as much access to
the two women as in the December summit, when journalists were able
to pepper them with questions during a nearly hour-long tour of the
White House.
   Though the American couple is staying only five days in the
Soviet capital, Mrs. Reagan plans to spend an entire day in
Leningrad, an hour's flight away.
   Whether that trip was planned to alleviate some possible
friction at this summit, neither the White House nor Soviet
officials will say.
   Ms. Tate said she believes Mrs. Reagan is well aware that it has
been more than a dozen years since a U.S. first lady and president
visited Soviet soil and is therefore intent on making a good
impression with the Soviet people.
   ``I've always said, while her husband represents the head of the
country, she represents the heart,'' Ms. Tate said.
   A senior U.S. official who who spoke on condition he not be
named, said the one-upmanship that occurs when the two women meet
isn't surprising.
   ``The personal chemistry between the two women isn't good,'' he
said, adding, ``I guess that's because they're much alike _ they
are both strong women.''
   Hewett said that compared to Soviet wives in the past, ``Raisa's
role has been a remarkable one,'' and that the couple has been
attempting to show their nation ``it's time to enter the 20th
Century.''
   But he noted that Mrs. Gorbachev has been the target of internal
Soviet criticism for her high public stance and he predicted she
will tone down the assertiveness she displayed in Washington.
   ``Gorbachev wants the (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces)
treaty, and other than that he wants an amiacable atmosphere at the
summit to show that he is in charge,'' Hewett said, adding that the
first ladies can contribute to that notion.
   On her own, Mrs. Reagan is scheduled to visit a Soviet
elementary school in Moscow, where she's expected to try out the
few Russian phrases she's been learning.
   Apparently stung by reports that she was not prepared for Mrs.
Gorbachev's forceful style and extensive knowledge of U.S. history,
art and political theory, Mrs. Reagan embarked on her own course of
study.
   The first lady has read several books on Soviet history,
culture, art and the Russian revolution, said her spokeswoman
Elaine Crispen.
   She has also viewed several videos on the country, including one
produced by Turner Broadcasting System and a series on the country
for ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' reported by the couple's son,
Ron.

   A reputation for ruthlessness stuck to Robert F. Kennedy,
because it seemed to explain something about him.
   He was the kid who lived to tackle in football games; the
diligent young aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy; the hound on Jimmy
Hoffa's trial; the designated S.O.B. in John F. Kennedy's
campaigns; the ``carpetbagger'' senator from New York; the
candidate for president who waited until Eugene McCarthy had led
the way.
   ``Reputation for ruthlessness'' is even in the index of an
admiring biography by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.
   But Bobby Kennedy was also, according to Luella Hennessey, a
nurse who worked for the family, ``the most thoughtful and
considerate of the Kennedy children.''
   In a Roman Catholic family that lived for politics, he was the
one boy who might have become a priest.
   ``He's got high moral standards,'' brother John once said.
   Bobby was the passionate one, the brother of the greatest
intensity _ a brooding quality some found to be deeply Irish.
   ``My, he is unassimilated, isn't he?'' the poet Robert Lowell
remarked after meeting him.
   Bobby first channeled that passion into college football, then
into service as an indefatigable aide to congressional committees
and his brother's campaigns. Finally, bereft of the brother he
idolized, he became a passionate advocate of civil rights and,
after years of backing the war, an opponent of the bloodshed in
Vietnam.
   ``Bobby resembles me more than any of the other children,''
patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy once said. ``He had the same capacity
for likes and dislikes, for love and hate.''
   Robert Francis was the seventh of nine Kennedy children, 10
years younger than Joe Jr. and eight years younger than Jack.
``When you come from that far down,'' he once said, ``you have to
struggle to survive.''
   He was the smallest of the four boys, accident-prone and clumsy
but determined to keep up.
   Unhappy at his slow progress in learning to swim, young Bobby
tried to learn all at once by jumping off a yawl into Nantucket
Sound, where he thrashed until Joe pulled him out.
   ``It showed either a lot of guts or no sense at all, depending
on how you looked at it,'' said Jack.
   Herbert Stokinger, his football coach at Milton Academy,
recalled: ``Bob (at only 160 pounds) loved to crunch. ... He loved
to hit his man. And when he hit, he seemed to come alive.''
   ``Bobby was an all-out,'' said Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas, who took the young attorney along on a visit to the Soviet
Union in 1955. ``If he was climbing a peak or hiking a trail, there
was nothing else in the world to do but that.''
   Schlesinger, author of ``Robert Kennedy and His Times,'' traces
the reputation for ruthlessness to Jack Kennedy's campaign for the
Senate in 1952. Bobby, the campaign manager, once booted a local
labor leader out of the office, saying, ``If you're not going to
work, don't hang around here.''
   When Jack Kennedy decided he didn't want to wage a joint
campaign with Massachusetts Gov. Paul Dever, he sent his brother to
deliver the bad news. ``Don't give it (the joint campaign) to
them,'' Jack told him, ``but don't get me involved in it.''
   ``Jack Kennedy,'' Dever reflected after the campaign, which he
lost, ``is the first Irish Brahmin. Bobby is the last Irish
puritan.''
   Bobby played a similar role in the presidential campaign of
1960. ``Inside the campaign he was the tireless investigator and
goad,'' Schlesinger wrote, ``responsible for everything but the
speeches. Outside he became the man to do the harsh jobs, saying
no, telling people off, whipping the reluctant and recalcitrant
into line.''
   Well before the 1960 campaign, Bobby had earned a national
reputation as a relentless investigator.
   In 1952, his father arranged for him to work for Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, the crusading anti-communist who headed the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Government Operations
Committee.
   McCarthy had made the acquaintance of the Kennedy family after
coming to Washington in 1947, and had won the admiration and
support of fellow Irishman Joseph Kennedy.
   McCarthy made Bobby an assistant counsel _ one of 15 _ to his
young chief counsel, Roy Cohn. Kennedy's major work was a report
detailing that three-fourths of the cargos reaching China were on
Western-flag ships _ this at the time China was sponsoring the
Communist side in the Korean War.
   The committee's more famous work, the hunt for subversives
within the government, was energetically led by Cohn and G. David
Schine.
   ``Cohn and Schine claimed they knew from the outset what was
wrong, and they were not going to allow the facts to interfere,''
said Kennedy, who resigned from the committee after six months.
   At this time in his life, Bobby made a disagreeable impression
even on some friends of the family. Theodore Sorenson, Jack's
speechwriter, found the younger brother to be ``militant,
aggressive, intolerant, opinionated, somewhat hollow in his
convictions.''
   Bobby returned to the Government Operations Committee in 1954 as
counsel for the minority Democrats, resuming his fencing matches
with Cohn. On June 11, in the acidic Army-McCarthy hearings,
Kennedy and Cohn nearly came to blows in the hearing room in what
one newspaper headline called a ``Hate Clash.''
   Even after McCarthy was censured in 1954, Bobby felt a personal
loyalty to the Republican from Wisconsin; in 1955 he walked out on
a speech by Edward R. Murrow, who had denounced McCarthy in a
famous CBS broadcast.
   Kennedy became majority counsel of the investigations committee,
under Sen. John L. McClellan, after Democrats regained control of
the Senate in 1954. First he went after Teamsters president Dave
Beck, and then Jimmy Hoffa, who led the union after Beck was
convicted of tax evasion.
   Kennedy's pursuit of Hoffa was bitter and personal, on both
sides, and continued when Kennedy became attorney general in his
brother's administration. Hoffa called Kennedy ``a young,
dim-witted, curly-headed smart-aleck.''

   In the Kennedy administration, Bobby was not only the attorney
general, but was also acknowledged as the president's closest
adviser. That closeness was, in some ways, a union of opposites.
   ``John Kennedy was the more secure, the freer, of the two _
freer of his father, of his family, of his faith, of the entire
Irish-American predicament,'' Schlesinger wrote. ``... The two
brothers had moved in different directions in adolescence and young
manhood. John establishing his intellectuality, Robert his
toughness. John his independence, Robert his commitment to the
family.''
   Devastated by his brother's death, Bobby struck his associates
as withdrawn, almost shrunken. He adopted his brother's habit of
smoking cigars and began carrying around one of JFK's old coats. He
read Greek tragedies and the work of Albert Camus, and turned to an
old passion _ football.
   ``Everybody was trying to get the hate and the anger out of
their systems,'' Pierre Salinger, JFK's old press secretary, told
Lester and Irene David, authors of ``Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a
Folk Hero.''
   ``Bobby was absolutely relentless,'' Salinger said. ``He
attacked the man with the ball like a tiger, slamming, bruising and
crushing, and so did everyone else. One guy broke a leg, and you
couldn't count the bloodied noses and contusions.''
   Bobby's own political campaigns were preceded by long bouts of
indecision. He didn't announce his candidacy for the Senate in New
York until the latter half of August 1964, although he wound up
winning easily.
   Because he was a Kennedy, there was always talk _ some hopeful,
some despairing _ that he would someday run for president.
   He remained an enigma _ something the cartoonist Jules Feiffer
ridiculed in 1967 as ``the Bobby twins.''
   ``The Good Bobby is a fervent civil libertarian. The Bad Bobby
is a fervent wiretapper,'' the cartoon said, adding: ``If you want
one Bobby to be your president, you will have to take both ... for
Bobbies are widely noted for their family unity.''
   Bobby wavered again in 1968 before jumping into the presidential
race, days after Sen. Eugene McCarthy had run a close second to
President Lyndon Johnson in the New Hampshire primary.
   ``It is hard to forgive Kennedy his shy, calculating delay in
declaring himself, or forgive the shaggy rudeness of his final
entrance,'' Lowell said in Oregon, even though he affirmed his
admiration for the man.
   Jacqueline Kennedy worried in the spring of 1968: ``Do you know
what I think will happen to Bobby? The same thing that happened to
Jack. ... There is so much hatred in this country, and more people
hate Bobby than hated Jack.''
   On the night he won the California primary, Bobby spoke for a
moment with Kenneth O'Donnell, a long-time Kennedy friend.
   ``You know, Kenny,'' he said, ``I feel now for the first time
that I've shaken off the shadow of my brother.''
   Within hours, he was dead.

   For those who loved Robert Kennedy and pinned
their hopes on his 1968 presidential candidacy, the ``what-if''
game has become a form of catharsis.
   Twenty years after he was gunned down, they remember him as he
was then _ a youthful 42-year-old heir to the political crown of
his slain brother, President John F. Kennedy.
   In his 30s, as his brother's attorney general and chief adviser,
he had been thrust into the center of key issues of the '60s _ the
civil rights struggle, the Cuban missile crisis and the Vietnam
War. As a New York senator, he adopted as his cause the plight of
the poor. And then he decided to run for president.
   ``What if he had lived?''
   The question was asked at a recent RFK Remembered conference.
And the answers came in a flood from those who had known him well.
   It would have been a better country, they said. There would have
been no President Nixon, no Watergate. The Vietnam War would have
ended earlier. The poor would have had an advocate that counted.
The young would have eschewed violence for peaceful participation
in the system.
   Or is this just wishful thinking?
   One Kennedy family biographer, David Horowitz, says it was
unlikely Robert would have become president and calls the
speculation idle.
   ``It's fantasy time,'' said Paul Schrade, the former United Auto
Workers official who was shot with Kennedy on June 5, 1968, and who
organized the conference.
   Schrade, whose skull was pierced by one of the assassin's
bullets, recalled the moments just beforehand, as RFK thanked
well-wishers after a speech: ``My own feeling when he was shaking
hands was, `We have a president.' Then I turned and got hit.''
   Schrade is not alone in believing Kennedy would have won and
might have resolved some of the era's most troubling problems.
   ``No one can tell where roads not taken might have led,'' said
scholar and Kennedy family intimate Arthur Schlesinger Jr. ``Yet
the likely probability is that Robert Kennedy would have gone on
from his victory in the California primary to win the Democratic
nomination for president and that he would have beaten Richard
Nixon in the fall election.''
   Such a presidency, Schlesinger said, would have saved lives by
withdrawing American troops from Vietnam in 1969 rather than 1972,
and would have slowed the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union.
   The minority view that Kennedy would have lost the election and
would have had little impact on national policy is posed by
Horowitz, who, in 1968, was editor of Ramparts, the radical
magazine that spoke for the New Left.
   ``I don't think he would have won,'' said Horowitz, co-author of
``The Kennedys.''
   ``There was no support for Bobby Kennedy on the left. ... The
(John F.) Kennedy government was responsible for the Vietnam War.
Bobby Kennedy was dangerous from their point of view. The blood of
Vietnam was on his hands.''
   Horowitz, who has since become an ultraconservative, dismisses
the idea that Kennedy was the lost leader who could have turned the
nation on a new, idealistic course.
   ``Bobby Kennedy was a complex guy and they've totally drained
the reality of the guy for this romantic, symbolic view,'' Horowitz
said. ``This is re-written history.''
   Pollster Mervin Field, whose California Poll has charted
political trends for nearly 40 years, agreed that RFK is ``more and
more glorified'' over time, but he's convinced that Kennedy would
have defeated Hubert Humphrey and Eugene McCarthy for the
nomination and Nixon in the general election.
   ``You know, Bobby was very controversial,'' he said. ``But he
came of age in the '68 campaign and he had some special qualities.''
   Tom Hayden believes a Kennedy candidacy would have calmed the
Chicago Democratic convention of 1968 and averted violent clashes
between antiwar demonstrators and police.
   ``Part of me feels the emptiness of missed possibilities and
always will,'' said Hayden, now a Calilfornia assemblyman. ``There
will never be another Robert Kennedy. ... There will never be a
time as poignant or important, but there is work to be done.''
   Among those who see Kennedy as the nation's lost hero is Jack
Newfield, the Village Voice writer who began his book, ``Robert
Kennedy: A Memoir,'' hours after he had witnessed Kennedy's
shooting in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen.
   ``I started to write it that night as therapy and catharsis,''
Newfield explained.
   ``Robert Kennedy's assassination is a wound that hurts more, not
less, as time passes,'' he wrote recently. ``It was an amputation.''
   With ``a conservative streak'' in his personality, Kennedy would
have forged a new coalition of liberals and conservatives in the
Democratic Party, Newfield suggested.
   ``He would have helped liberalism shed its skin and become
almost more contemporary,'' said the writer. ``It was certainly a
lost possibility that will never be recovered.''
   One of those closest to Kennedy in his final days was his
special assistant for public information, Edwin O. Guthman, who
acknowledges that a Robert Kennedy presidency was not a sure thing.
   ``I don't know that he would have won,'' said Guthman. ``The
only thing you can be sure of is he would have gotten the
nomination. That's pretty clear.''
   Guthman, who helped edit a new book, ``Robert Kennedy In His Own
Words,'' said RFK would be remembered for his fight against
organized crime, his civil rights work and his advocacy for the
poor.
   He added: ``One thing that's certain is, had he lost the
election, he would not have retreated. He would have stayed in
there and fought for what he believed in.''

   The arms control treaty President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came close to
agreeing to in ``raise-you-one'' negotiations in Iceland is on the
table again in Moscow _ still enticing and still elusive.
   But U.S. officials do not expect Reagan to engage this time in
impromptu, derring-do, head-to-head negotiating with Gorbachev of
the sort they partook in at Reykjavik in October 1986.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been negotiating,
off and on, since 1982 on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known
as START. The United States proposed a 30 percent cut in both
nations' stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union
countered by proposing 50 percent.
   It looked for a moment like Gorbachev and Reagan might have a
deal _ or at least agreement at the top on the framework for a deal
_ when they met in Iceland.
   But Reagan's dream of a space-based missile defense system _
Star Wars _ proved too great a stumbling block.
   Gorbachev wanted testing limited to the laboratory. Reagan
wanted real world testing. They could not agree and parted in
disappointment. START went back to Geneva, where both sides have
been negotiating.
   Now it appears too late for a START agreement. Soviet officials
say more than 1,200 points of disagreement exist.
   The issue is awesomely complex, especially the question of
verification. Strategic weapons can be delivered by bombers or
missiles.
   Missiles can be fired from land, planes, ships or submarines.
Land-fired missiles can be launched from fixed sites, or movable
sites _ mobile missiles systems of which the Soviets have two and
the United States have none.
   The two sides are unable to find acceptable ways to verify
cutbacks in such easily hidden systems.
   Another issue is whether a START agreement would ban existing or
future intercontinental ballistic missile systems.
   On top of that, Reagan's Star Wars program remains a seemingly
insurmountable obstacle. The Soviets want to restrict tests in
space, and will not agree to cuts in offensive weapons unless they
can call the reductions off if they conclude Star Wars violates the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   ``It's now clear there is no way these questions can be shaped
up in treaty form in time for the summit,'' Secretary of State
George P. Shultz said May 12 in Geneva, Switzerland after winding
up pre-summit talks with his Soviet counterpart, Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   That being the case, U.S. officials do no expect Reagan to try
to bridge the gap in face-to-face talks with Gorbachev.
   At their first summit in Geneva in 1985, the two leaders spent
time alone, in front of a roaring fireplace, and then walking
outside in the snappy Swiss fall air.
   The informality of the arrangement, with only their interpreters
present, helped break the ice.
   As they strolled back from a conversation in a garden gazebo,
Gorbachev accepted Reagan's proposal for annual summit meetings.
Apparently, that was the only time in their three summit meetings
that one-on-one sessions produced a substantive result.
   At their second summit, in Reykjavik, Reagan was alone with
Gorbachev for about 25 minutes, mostly discussing human rights.
When they turned to the detailed issue of arms control _ and
swapped proposals that escalated until it seemed there would be a
breakthrough in the arms race _ Reagan had Shultz at his side.
   Reykjavik did set the stage for the treaty signed by Reagan and
Gorbachev last December in Washington to eliminate all U.S. and
Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   In Washington, Reagan and Gorbachev were alone for about a
half-hour. Again, the subject was human rights.
   In Moscow, apart from the opening night dinner, Reagan's program
calls for two private sessions with Gorbachev.
   The first will be in the Kremlin, shortly after the president
arrives from Helsinki, Finland. A Gorbachev greeting is all that is
anticipated. On Reagan's third day in Moscow they will be alone
again.
   Even without a START breakthrough, there is much on the arms
control agenda for them to discuss.
   They may sign an agreement under which each side would notify
the other before testing a land-based or submarine-based missile,
giving the place of launch and intended target.
   They may sign protocols calling for experiments to establish
more thorough means of verifying two treaties that have been agreed
upon but never verified by the Senate _ although experts believe
both sides are adhering to them.
   These are the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty signed on July 3, 1974
and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty signed May 28, 1976,
banning nuclear tests greater than 150 kilotons (more than 100
times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb in World War II).
   Gorbachev, in a grand gesture, may announce the unilateral
withdrawal of 50,000 to 100,000 forward-based Soviet troops in
Europe in an effort to spur agreement on a reduction of both sides'
conventional forces in Europe.
   Western experts say the Soviet bloc has a 2-1 advantage over the
West in conventional forces. The Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction Talks went on for 14 years without producing agreement.
   Finally, the superpowers may agree on ways to bring about a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons. Forty nations are negotiating at
the United Nations Committee on Disarmament on a ban, but the talks
are stalled over the intrusive verification measures that would be
required to assure compliance. These weapons can be manufactured in
ordinary chemical factories without attracting attention.

<HEAD>Reagan's Summit: The Gipper Visits the Evil Empire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's trip to Moscow
promises to be short on substance but rich in symbolism: the Gipper
visits the Evil Empire, the captain of capitalism vs. the ruler of
communism, the great communicator co-stars with the media-savvy
Kremlin chief.
   Over five days of talks in the Kremlin beginning Sunday, Reagan
and Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev are
not expected to produce the nuclear-arms treaty that they once
hoped to sign in Moscow. Nor are they expected to announce any
breakthroughs on other subjects.
   ``The headline of this summit is that there is no headline _ the
summit that didn't bark,'' said Stephen Sestanovich, a former
National Security Council staff member who runs the Soviet studies
program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.
   ``This is not a high-water mark,'' said Rozanne Ridgway, an
assistant secretary of state. ``It's sort of like catching your
second wind.''
   White House communications director Tom Griscom said, ``Maybe we
can get away from the fact that you only meet because you sign
arms-control agreements because there are other things that are
important too: human rights, regional concerns, people-to-people
exchanges.''
   Reagan said he even has some suggestions for Gorbachev about
ways to improve the troubled Soviet economy.
   If nothing more, the summit will move the spotlight for Reagan
away from embarrassing controversies about the now-failed
negotiations to remove Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
conflict-of-interest investigations of Attorney General Edwin Meese
and unflattering portraits of Reagan in books written by former
White House aides.
   For his part, Gorbachev will reap benefits because the summit
should bolster his prestige in advance of a rare Communist Party
conference later in the month on his program of economic and social
reforms.
   ``The visit allows him to demonstrate that he has been able to
re-engage with the United States, with the West, that he has been
able to produce from that dialogue agreements, such as INF (the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces missile treaty signed in
December) ... that he can describe, as we do, a relationship which
is now more predictable,'' Mrs. Ridgway said.
   ``Going into whatever meetings he's going into, that would stand
as an accomplishment,'' she said.
   A senior U.S. government official said it would be a successful
summit for Gorbachev just getting ``the most conservative president
in U.S. history coming to the Soviet Union.
   In his public appearances in Moscow, Reagan plans to offer
encouragement for Gorbachev's reforms and express hope for more.
   ``Broadly, what you hope will come out of it would be to
recognize that the relationship between the United States and
Soviet Union has changed,'' Griscom said.
   ``The issues that we talk about are much broader now,'' he said.
``It's not just a narrow agenda. It's a full agenda and it ought to
stay that way.'' Griscom said Reagan's tactics should stand as a
model for his successors.
   Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department and NSC staffer,
said Reagan's visit has ``symbolic and political significance'' by
the mere fact that it coincides with the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan.
   ``From the standpoint of this president, this coincidence of his
appearing in Moscow while the world's television screens are full
of Soviet forces leaving Afghanistan ... is a kind of vindication
of what this president said he was setting out to do when he
started in 1981, which was to slow down the momentum of Soviet
expansion,'' Sonnenfeldt said.
   The only thing that is guaranteed at the summit is a series of
photo opportunties against carefully picked backgrounds.
   The news simply may be the remarkable nature of the event.
   Begin with the fact that no American president has visited
Moscow in 14 years.
   Moreover, only three presidents _ Franklin Roosevelt, Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford _ have ever set foot in the Soviet Union.
   Four years ago it seemed likely Reagan would wind up as the
first American president since World War II not to have a summit
with the Soviet leader.
   Now it turns out he will have had more superpower summits than
any other president _ four in just 30 months.
   It is a remarkable turnabout for Reagan, who earlier in his
presidency called the Kremlin an ``evil empire'' and described
U.S.-Soviet relations as ``a conflict between good and evil.'' A
tough line of anti-communist rhetoric had been Reagan's trademark
for four decades as he preached a gospel of military strength.
   ``Who would have thought in the early '80s, both in the Soviet
Union and the U.S.A., that it would be President Reagan who would
sign with us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history,''
Gorbachev mused in an interview with The Washington Post.
   Gorbachev said, ``Realism is an important quality in President
Reagan ... By this I mean the ability to adapt one's views to the
changing situation, while remaining faithful to one's convictions.''
   Reagan and Gorbachev held their first meeting in Geneva in
November 1985, and set a goal of a 50 percent cut in strategic
nuclear weapons and began a course of lowering East-West tensions.
   Eleven months later, they met in Reykjavik, Iceland, where they
came close to reaching sweeping arms agreements but, instead,
parted in anger over a dispute about the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative _ Star Wars.
   They papered over the Star Wars disagreement when they held
their third summit in Washington last December. The meeting was
crowned by the signing of the INF treaty.
   Reagan now considers Gorbachev a real friend, despite their
disagreements. He says the Soviet leader, unlike his predecessors,
is not bent on world domination but content to see the superpowers
live together in peace.
   In Gorbachev, Reagan has a formidable rival, whose apparent
self-confidence, media polish and style appeal to Westeners.
   In fact, Americans view Gorbachev almost as favorably as they do
Reagan, and the Soviet leader outpolls the president among
college-educated Americans, according to a Media General-Associated
Press survey.
   The leaders will get intense media exposure in meetings
beginning Sunday and ending Thursday. In addition to talks at the
Kremlin, they will host elegant dinners for each other and attend
the Bolshoi Ballet with their wives.
   Reagan is not expected to jump out his limousine and wade into a
street crowd, as Gorbachev did in Washington. But the president has
plenty of attention-grabbing events on his agenda. He plans to
visit the Danilov Monastery in Moscow to talk about freedom of
religion. Reagan also will meet with Soviet dissidents and
``refuseniks'' who are denied permission to emigrate.
   Reagan is to have lunch at the Union of Writers with artists,
filmmakers, intellectuals and others to discuss freedom of
expression.
   In addition, the president is to deliver an address on
U.S.-Soviet relations at Moscow University and then conduct a
question-and-answer session with students.
   He also plans a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   A room in the Kremlin has been reserved and time set aside
Wednesday for the signing of any agreements, such as a minor pact
on missile-testing notification, anti-cheating provisions for
peaceful nuclear explosions and monitoring steps at nuclear test
sites.

   The nation's trade deficit narrowed
dramatically during the first three months of the year as an
all-time high in U.S. export sales offset a relentless climb in
imports, the government said.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the trade gap
from January through March totaled $35.9 billion, a 12.7 percent
drop from a deficit of $41.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   It was the second quarterly improvement in the deficit in the
past two years and represented the biggest decline since the
deficit fell by 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices rebounded from an early
sell-off to finish little changed in quiet trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, contracts for
July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude
oil, settled at $17.37 per 42-gallon barrel, down 3 cents from
Tuesday's close.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled at 51.72 cents a gallon, down 0.13 cent, while
wholesale heating oil closed at 47.31 cents a gallon, unchanged
from Tuesday.
   Analysts said July crude broke through the psychologically
important $17.30-per-gallon barrier early in the trading session
following the release of statistics that showed a recent buildup in
U.S. oil inventories.
   ``The market showed a little weakness on the statistics,'' which
also showed an increase in refining runs, said John Hill, vice
president at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Traders interpret an increase in refining as a signal that
product inventories might increase in the near future.
   But ``sellers didn't come out in force,'' Hill said, and oil
futures prices were able to regain some ground in quiet trading.

<HEAD>Quarterly Trade Figures Upbeat; Homes Sales Climb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The trade deficit is definitely improving, existing home sales
are up and business failures are down, according to the latest
batch of economic data.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday the nation's trade
deficit narrowed dramatically during the first three months of the
year as an all-time high in U.S. export sales offset a climb in
imports.
   The trade deficit from January through March totaled $35.9
billion, a 12.7 percent drop from a deficit of $41.2 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   It was only the second quarterly improvement in the deficit in
the past two years and it represented the biggest decline since the
deficit fell by 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982.
   The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown
up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The
earlier figures showed a 16.4 percent drop in the deficit to $36
billion in the first quarter, compared with $43.1 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   Wednesday's figures are smaller because they subtract factors
such as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers.
The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal
variations; the monthly figures are not.
   In other economic news Wednesday, a major real estate trade
group said sales of existing homes increased 4.5 percent in April,
the biggest advance in 17 months. The group attributed the increase
to a rush of closings in the face of rising interest rates.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.48
million units last month, following increases of 2.5 percent in
both February and March.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist for the association, cautioned
that the sales pace could slow in the months ahead.
   Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said business failures declined by 10.1
percent in the first quarter over a year ago due to an improving
outlook for farmers and retailers.
   The business-information company said 15,211 businesses
nationwide went under during the first three months of this year,
compared with 16,924 in 1987.
   In Washington, federal banking regulators said the nation's
commercial banks appeared to be recovering from their worst year
since the Depression despite mounting bank failures in the
Southwest and continuing problems with loans to Third World
countries.
   ``The banking system as a whole is sound and getting sounder,''
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman told
the Senate Banking Committee.
   The performance of farm banks is slowly improving as agriculture
recovers from its slump, he said.
   Seidman further noted that the nation's largest banks have
written off big losses and now have ``adequate, if not comfortable,
reserves.'' He also claimed the economy of the Southwest, heavily
dependent on the oil industry, has hit bottom and is turning up.

<TEXT>
   Carl C. Icahn is a man obsessed with making
deals.
   Before his record-shattering, $13.64 billion offer for Texaco
Inc. on Wednesday, the 52-year-old financier had already tracked,
cornered and _ in some cases _ acquired some of America's most
imposing corporations.
   There was Marshall Field & Co., the retailer. And
Chesebrough-Ponds Inc., the consumer products company. Phillips
Petroleum Co., USX Corp., ACF Industries Inc., Trans World Airlines
_ and on and on.
   His scrapbook of corporate raids reads like a Standard & Poor's
Register of U.S. companies. Indeed, Icahn is so well known in the
takeover business, he says he was considered for _ but turned down
_ a role in the movie ``Wall Street,'' which starred Michael
Douglas as a vicious corporate raider.
   Always his own boss, Icahn is a master strategist who recently
described himself in Fortune magazine as ``obsessive in everything
I do.''
   Often reluctant to speak to the press, he is actually quite
loquacious in person, people who know him say.
   ``I talk to him all the time. I mean, I listen to him all the
time. There's a difference,'' Texaco Inc. President James W.
Kinnear joked recently.
   Icahn's involvement with Texaco has been no laughing matter to
Texaco's managers, however.
   After launching a slate of candidates for the company's board of
directors and negotiating with Texaco over the terms of a
restructuring, Icahn decided Wednesday to take matters into his own
hands and make an offer to acquire the company at $60 a share _ in
cash.
   It would be the largest deal of its kind in American history.
   Holding 14.8 percent of Texaco's stock, Icahn had been
pressuring the oil giant to put itself up for sale since it emerged
from a 13-month reorganization under the supervision of a
bankruptcy court judge.
   ``I've learned one thing: What counts is which way the tide is
going _ on the last day,'' he said recently in describing his
protracted battle with Texaco.
   Whatever happens, it is generally agreed that if anyone could
dislodge the status quo at Texaco, it's Icahn, the man whose very
name can send shivers through boardrooms across the land.
   He has made a reputation by buying up shares in companies with
assets worth more than their stock price, then selling the
companies off later, in whole or in pieces, at a highe price.
   Sometimes companies have agreed to buy the stock back at a
premium to get him to leave them alone, a practice known as
``greenmail.'' Other times, as with Trans World Airlines and ACF
Industries, Icahn has retained a management role, but also has used
the company as a vehicle for more takeover attempts.
   One way or another, Icahn almost always walks away millions of
dollars richer.
   To his critics, Icahn is little more than a pirate in a coat and
tie. But Icahn says the real villains are corporate chieftans who
are wasteful, inefficient and more interested in protecting their
high-salaried jobs than looking out for the interests of their
stockholders.
   That, more than the money _ which he does not need _ is what
keeps him in the takeover game, Icahn recently told The Associated
Press.
   ``I think there's no question there's a competitive force in me.
But it's also a sense of outrage about the way companies are run,''
he said.
   Actually, Icahn's management has been paying off at both TWA,
which he took over in January 1986, and ACF, a conglomerate he
bought in 1984 and stripped down to its core railroad-car business.

PaineWebber Inc. ``We ought to use him against the Russians. I
mean, this guy is good.''

<HEAD>Farley After Up to 25 Percent Of West Point-Pepperell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farley Inc., one of the nation's largest
privately owned conglomerates, is going after a major stake in West
Point-Pepperell Inc., a major textile manufacturer which itself
just swallowed a rival company.
   Pepperell announced Wednesday that Farley had filed with the
Federal Trade Commission seeking permission to acquire between 15
percent and 25 percent of the West Point, Ga., company's
approximately 32 million outstanding shares.
   Rumors have been circulating for several weeks that Farley,
whose holdings include Fruit of the Loom Inc., was interested in
buying into Pepperell.
   Pepperell said it did not know how much Farley, owned by William
F. Farley, already owned or what Farley's intent is. However,
Farley has filed no other papers with security agencies, meaning it
has less than a 5 percent stake in the company.
   Pepperell's stock was among the most active in trading Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange as 1.2 million shares changed hands,
with the price climbing $4 a share to close at $35.375.
   A spokesman at Farley's Chicago headquarters would say only that
Pepperell ``is a fine company and we think it's a good investment.''
   Farley has $300 million available for acquisitions from a bond
issue earlier this year, the spokesman said, but some analysts
expressed surprise over the move because of the high debt carried
by both Farley and Pepperell.
   Farley has about $1.4 billion in debt, and Pepperell owes about
$1.1 billion after its recent $1.22 billion buyout of rival textile
maker J.P. Stevens & Co.
   ``It didn't seem to make much sense to me when I first heard
talk of him (Farley) buying the entire company,'' said Kay Norwood,
an analyst with Interstate Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
   But she said Pepperell's acquisition of Stevens will ``pay off
in a major way,'' and ``if (Farley) is approaching this from the
standpoint of investing, ... he's a pretty smart fellow.''
   Patricia Ryan, an analyst with Raymond James in St. Petersburg,
Fla., said, ``We had been hearing the rumors that (Farley) was
interested since the beginning of May. I am a little surprised he
is willing to take on that much debt.''
   Farley's filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act gives the FTC
and the U.S. Department of Justice up to 30 days to review the
proposed deal for anti-competitive effects. The agencies can take
no action, seek a negotiated settlement or seek an injunction
blocking the deal. The parties also could voluntarily back out.
   Pepperell recently became the nation's largest publicly owned
textile company through the Stevens acquisition.
   Pepperell joined with its rival suitor for Stevens, New York
investment firm Odyssey Partners, to acquire Stevens in a deal
which left Pepperell with most of Stevens' linen and towel
operations and gave the company about 25 percent of the nation's
home fashion textile market.
   Pepperell sold Stevens' carpet and industrial fabrics division
to Odyssey, and to satisfy antitrust concerns, sold Stevens' sheet
and towel plants to Bibb Manufacturing Co. of Macon, Ga.
   A health-conscious, former door-to-door encyclopedia salesman,
William Farley also controls Acme Boot Co., Anaheim Citrus Products
Co., Doehler-Jarvis and Southern Fastening Systems through Farley
Inc.
   Farley Inc. employs about 25,000 workers.
   Late last year, William Farley toyed with entering the
Democratic presidential derby, but backed out in November, saying
he had waited too long to get in the race.

<HEAD>Sugarman Apparently Loses Bid For Media General Board Slate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burt Sugarman says he is not surprised he
may have lost his bid to put three people on the board of Media
General Inc., but that the 10.3 million votes his plan got should
send a message to the company.
   Sugarman, a California-based investor, launched a $1.8 billion
takeover bid for Media General earlier this year.
   ``From the outset of the proxy contest with Media General, we
recognized that it would be an uphill battle,'' Sugarman said
Wednesday after the company announced that preliminary results from
Friday's shareholders' vote show the incumbent management nominees
won re-election.
   The returns show the three incumbents have received more than 56
percent of the vote, compared with 42.6 percent for Sugarman's
proposed slate, Media General President James S. Evans said.
   Evans said Corporation Trust Co., an election inspection
company, told him the incumbents received 13.5 million votes and
Sugarman's ticket of himself, Harold Simmons and David Gotterer got
just under 10.3 million votes.
   Evans said a final report on the vote will come after both sides
get an opportunity to inspect proxies and raise any questions with
Corporation Trust.
   Sugarman said the shareholders who backed his slate ``cast their
proxies in favor of enhancing values for all shareholders _ whether
it be through our $70-per-share cash merger offer or another type
of transaction.
   ``We fully expect that Media General's management and their
board of directors will respect the opinion of this large group of
shareholders and initiate action that will maximize shareholder
value,'' added Sugarman, who in his address to shareholders at
Friday's annual meeting talked about the possibility of splitting
Media General up into two or three smaller companies.
   Evans said Corporation Trust told him that 86 percent of Media
General's total outstanding 28 million Class A shares voted.
   The family of Media General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan owns 71
percent of the company's controlling Class B shares, which control
seven of the 10 board seats.
   Sugarman owns 10 percent of Media General's Class A holdings,
and in February he offered $61.50 a share for Media General, a bid
he later boosted to $70 a share, or about $1.8 billion.
Subsequently, he offered his own slate to challenge the three
Bryan-supported directors seeking re-election to the board's three
Class A seats.
   As the shareholders meeting approached, lawyers for both parties
sought court relief from what they characterized as false and
misleading information the other side was giving shareholders about
the proxy battle. U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams denied
both parties' motions, saying the proper time to file them would be
after the annual meeting.
   ``Any further challenge by the Sugarman group is likely to come
through the courts, where we have litigation already pending,''
Evans said Wednesday.
   Media General owns several daily newspapers, including the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader, as well as
several weekly papers, television stations and cable operations.
   Sugarman is chairman and chief executive officer of Barris
Industries Inc., a producer of television programs, and Giant Group
Ltd., whose holdings including cement businesses.

<HEAD>EEC Stops Imports Of U.S. Apples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reduced demand for apples, coupled with
rising foreign supply, has prompted the European Economic Community
to stop importing the fruit from the United States and some other
countries, according to an EEC spokeswoman.
   The 12-nation European trading bloc imposed import quotas on
apples this year and orth America _ which includes apples from the
United States and Canada _ reached its limit of 17,600 metric tons
in late April, Ella Krucoff said.
   ``The reason (the EEC) thought it was an emergency situation was
that consumption was down and imports were way, way, way up,'' Ms.
Krucoff said in a telephone interview Wednesday from Washington,
D.C.
   The quotas will remain in place until Aug. 31, the end of the
current apple season, she said.
   ``This is a one-time thing,'' Ms. Krucoff said, adding that it
was the first such EEC restriction covering U.S. apples in at least
10 years.
   The EEC quota system has also banned further imports of apples
from Chile, a major supplier at this time of year, Ms. Krucoff
said. That country's limit was more than 142,000 metric tons, she
said.
   Washington state is the largest U.S. apple producer, but
traditionally has not had much success in cracking the European
market.
   However, the nation had been enjoying a record export year to
Europe prior to the imposition of the quotas, said Charles St. John
of the Washington Apple Commission. Exports to Europe had jumped
from 500,000 boxes last year to 2 million boxes prior to the ban,
he said.
   A box normally holds about 42 pounds of apples.
   The ban's impact on total U.S. exports will not be great, St.
John said.
   ``Normally after the first of May exports really start to taper
off because of the Southern Hemisphere crop,'' he said.
   Still, negotiations are underway to allow for additional U.S.
exports to EEC countries, he said.
   The financial impact of the decision on U.S. apple growers is
unclear, because apples destined for EEC countries will now have to
be sold elsewhere, which could depress prices, St. John said.
   He called the EEC quota a ``protectionist activity'' for the
benefit of European growers.
   Washington state produces half the nation's supermarket apples,
with this year's record crop expected to produce about 67 million
boxes.
   The nation has also produced a record fresh market crop of about
130 million boxes this year.
   About 15 percent of the Washington state crop, or 10 million
boxes, remains to be sold before the end of the season in August,
St. John said, adding that most of those apples will go to domestic
markets.
   The majority of Washington state exports traditionally go to
Asian countries, and St. John said it was unclear if the EEC ban
would prompt increased competition with Chile for Asian markets
this year.
   The EEC is made up of France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain
and Britain.

<HEAD>Tenneco To Sell Oil and Gas Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc., the 10th-largest U.S. oil company,
picked a favorable time to sell its oil and natural gas operations,
analysts say.
   ``I think they see where they can liquidate some assets at
decent values,'' said H.B. Juengling, a gas pipeline analyst for
Howard Weil Lobouisse Friedrichs Inc. in Houston. ``In 1986, the
values just weren't there.''
   On Wednesday, Houston-based Tenneco announced it would be
leaving the oil business by selling its oil and gas operations,
concentrating instead on other industrial and pipeline ventures.
   The company would not put an estimate on how much the sales
might bring, but George J. Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W.
Baird & Co. Inc. in Milwaukee, believes Tenneco has already courted
some interested buyers.
   ``I would expect they've had a nudge already, and decided to go
public with the announcement to solicit other bids to make sure
they will get the most attractive price possible,'' Gaspar said.
   Tenneco, which posted 1987 revenue of $14.8 billion, will use
proceeds from the sale to help pay its hefty $8.5 billion debt,
Tenneco spokeswoman Suzanne Thomas said.
   ``The new Tenneco will be a financially stronger and more
focused company,'' said James L. Ketelsen, Tenneco's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``With significantly reduced debt and capital expenditure needs,
the company's earnings should improve materially, and its intrinsic
value to shareholders will be secured and enhanced,'' he said.
   Proceeds from the sale also may be used to repurchase shares of
the company's common stock, depending on market conditions and
total proceeds from the sale, Ketelsen added.
   Tenneco has adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to thwart
hostile takeover bids and prevent someone from gaining control of
the company without offering a fair price to all shareholders.
   The oil and gas ventures being sold are from the Tenneco Oil Co.
subsidiary engaged in oil exploration, production, refining and
marketing.
   In 1987, the subsidiary had revenue of $3.3 billion and
operating income of $233 million. Its proved reserves of crude oil
and natural gas liquids were 407 million barrels at the end of
1987. Natural gas reserves totaled 2.95 trillion cubic feet.
   ``While profitable, these businesses are not now providing
adequate returns on past invested capital, and we do not believe
their market value is fully reflected in Tenneco stock prices,''
Ms. Thomas said.
   ``The sale will unlock the underlying value and provide us funds
that will enable us to take advantage of growth opportunities in
our pipeline and industrial businesses.''
   The current mix of business in Tenneco's energy ventures make up
22 percent of the company's revenue, while all its industrial and
pipeline ventures account for 78 percent, she said.
   After the sale, Tenneco will be comprised of 31 percent farm and
construction equipment, 23 percent pipeline, 14 percent
shipbuilding, 13 percent auto parts, 10 percent packaging and 9
percent chemicals.
   The businesses are: Tenneco Automotive, an auto parts
manufacturer that includes Monroe shock absorbers and Walker
exhaust systems; Packaging Corp. of America, a major producer of
paperboard, molded fiber, aluminum foil and plastic packaging;
Newport News Shipbuilding, the largest privately owned shipyard in
the world; and Albright & Wilson Ltd., a manufacturer and marketer
of specialty chemicals and phosphates.
   Tenneco said the businesses together have achieved a five-year
compound annual growth rate of 18 percent in operating income and
have averaged 26 percent return on net assets employed.
   The shipbuilding and auto parts companies are worth an estimated
$1.25 billion each.
   Tenneco also owns Case IH, the nation's second-largest farm
equipment maker, and Tenneco Minerals. Ketelsen said Case should be
able to reap benefits from further upturns in the domestic
agricultural equipment business. Tenneco Minerals is a producer of
soda ash and gold.
   Tenneco also operates a Gas Pipeline Group, a 20,000-mile
network of natural gas pipelines serving 26 states.

<HEAD>House Could Vote on Fiscal 1989 Budget Today If Compromise Reached</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: May be topped; also ran on general news wires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators have ironed out most
of the details of a $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget, and House
leaders are hoping the rest of the differences can be resolved in
time for a vote today.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said Wednesday there were only about $150 million in
differences remaining and that he anticipated a speedy resolution.
   The House Rules Committee cleared the way for the vote today
with its approval on Wednesday of a resolution allowing immediate
action on the budget compromise. Usually, the resolution has to sit
for three days before a vote. Congress leaves town at the end of
business today for a Memorial Day holiday.
   Both the House and Senate have passed budget resolutions that
follow the outlines of last fall's deficit reduction agreement with
President Reagan. That agreement spelled out spending totals for
military, foreign aid and domestic agency accounts.
   But negotiators have been bogged down for six weeks over
priorities within the domestic budget.
   The budget doesn't require the president's signature. However,
it serves as a guide for Congress in producing its 13 annual
spending bills and any changes in taxes or entitlements that would
require the president's signature.
   The $14 billion in new taxes for fiscal 1989 contained in the
deficit agreement were enacted last December.
   The budget has to comply with the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget
law, as well as meet the budget agreement with the president. The
Reagan administration already has warned that the spending plans of
the Democratic-controlled Congress might exceed the limits of
Gramm-Rudman.
   If the administration determines that a deficit of more than
$146 billion could be expected in fiscal 1989, automatic spending
cuts would be imposed next fall to bring the budget into line.
   The budget already is six weeks past its statuatory deadline,
and the House has begun approving spending bills without the final
budget outline.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Kiss-and-tell'' books may generate quick cash
for former government employees, but job hunters could be putting
the kiss of death on their chances if they complain about past
bosses, experts say.
   ``If you have a grievance, the court to resolve that grievance
is not in your next job interview,'' Robert Bies, assistant
professor of organization behavior at Northwestern University's
Kellogg School of Management, said Wednesday night.
   ``Nobody wants to hire a complainer,'' Bies said in a telephone
interview. ``Nobody wants to hire an attitude problem.''
   ``Kiss and tell'' have become Washington watchwords of late.
Former Reagan administration aides from budget whiz David Stockman
to spokesman Larry Speakes to staff head Donald Regan have penned
books with what some consider embarrassing references to operations
in the White House.
   Bies said revelations such as Speakes' disclosure that he made
up some quotes he had attributed to President Reagan made Speakes
appear less credible as a spokesman for any firm. Speakes made the
disclosure in his book, ``Speaking Out.''
   After controversy surrounding the publication of his book this
spring, Speakes left his job as vice president of communications
for the Wall Street firm of Merrill Lynch.
   ``Maybe the income from the book is enough to compensate,'' Bies
said.
   But if Speakes is a highly visible spokesman, ``You're always
going to wonder if he's telling the truth _ is it Speakes, or is it
the CEO (chief executive officer) that's talking?''
   Bies said that discussing problems with past employers in a job
interview, embarrassing or not, almost always sends the wrong
message.
   ``I may say I want someone to be forthright and open,'' he said,
putting himself in the employer's place, ``but most companies don't
really like that. ... Nobody wants a whistle-blower. They want a
team player.''
   People who are willing to approach current bosses about problems
are needed to keep companies on the ``cutting edge,'' Bies said,
because they can point out performance problems that could be
costly in the long run. But that doesn't change the human nature of
bosses' not wanting to hear about the problems, he said.
   Past problems should be framed positively in job interviews,
with negative statements limited to things such as ``We had a
parting of the ways,'' he said.
   A warning against employer-bashing was also issued by James E.
Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a
Chicago-based consulting firm which helps find new jobs for people.
   ``Sour grapes seldom win,'' Challenger said in a statement. ``No
one wants to hire an individual who bad-mouths a prior employer.''
   Such talk can also raise questions about a person's ability to
get along with co-workers, an essential for productivity, he said.
   Job-seekers should also avoid unrealistic bragging, or
indications that they may know better how to run things than their
bosses, Challenger said.
   ``When job hunting, the employer is always right,'' he said.
``That means leaving your ego at the door when you go into the
interview.''

<TEXT>
   Leon Shimkin, who joined Simon &
Schuster as a 17-year-old bookkeeper and eventually bought the
entire publishing company, has died at the age of 81 at New
Rochelle Hospital.
   Shimkin, who lived in Larchmont, was chairman of the board of
Simon & Schuster and one of the founders of Pocket Books, the
company's mass market paperback division.
   He sold Simon & Schuster to Gulf & Western in 1975, but
continued to go to the office he maintained in the Simon & Schuster
building in midtown Manhattan twice a week until he became ill last
winter, according to his son, Michael.
   Shimkin died Wednesday of ``natural causes,'' his son said this
morning.
   In pursuit of his goal to combine ``the creative art of
publishing with the science of commerce,'' Shimkin played a major
role in transforming book publishing from a cottage industry to big
business.
   In his history of paperback publishing, ``Two-Bit Culture,''
Kenneth C. Davis said that many in publishing resented Shimkin's
``dollar-oriented publishing.''
   ``But few people inside publishing begrudged Shimkin his
financial savvy, and it was soon acknowledged that the way of the
shrewd businessman was the track that the publishing business was
heading down.'' Davis wrote.
   Shimkin was born in Brooklyn, the son of Russian immigrants, and
joined the company in 1924 after completing his freshman year at
New York University. Shimkin finished his degree at night and, out
of gratitude, became a major benefactor to the school, which has
named a building on its Washington Square campus after him.
   Although he rarely involved himself in the editorial side of the
business, he was responsible for two books published in the late
1930s that are still among the company's biggest sellers: ``Your
Income Tax'' by J.K. Lasser and ``How to Win Friends and Influence
People'' by Dale Carnegie.
   He is survived by his wife, Rebecca; a daughter, Emily Gindin of
Princeton, N.J; and his son, who lives in New York.
   Funeral services are planned for 10 a.m. Friday at Temple Israel
in New Rochelle. The family has requested donations be made to
charity in lieu of flowers, Michael Shimkin said.

   Fireblight has struck 60 to 70 percent of
the pear trees in the Yakima Valley and will probably reduce the
current crop, officials say.
   The blight bacteria, which enters during spring bloom, has also
infected trees in the Columbia River Basin, said Mike Willett of
the Yakima County cooperative extension office.
   ``It's a real disaster for those individuals that have to remove
those trees,'' Willett said Wednesday.
   The infection will reduce the crop, but it is impossible to
predict by how much, he said.
   Washington is the nation's second largest pear producer after
California, accounting for about 35 percent of the nation's
production in 1986, according to state Department of Agriculture
statistics. The crop was worth $72.7 million to growers that year,
the last for which statistics are available.
   So far 50 to 100 acres of pear trees, mostly eight to nine years
old and just coming into production, have been destroyed in central
Washington because of fireblight, Willett said.
   It costs $10,000 to $15,000 to bring an acre of pear trees to
production, he added. Pears bring $12 to $15 a box.
   In most trees the infected branches can be pruned, reducing
production but allowing the trees to survive, Willett said. There
is no other treatment, and the infection period has passed, he
added.
   ``You can spend as much as $800 to $1,000 a day in controlling
fireblight,'' he said.
   The bacteria, which prevents widespread pear production in much
of the United States, requires warm temperature at bloom time to
enter the trees, Willett said.
   Spring temperatures in Central Washington are usually too low,
but warm weather last month allowed the bacteria to multiply and
spread, he said.
   Of the 11,000 acres of pear trees in Yakima County, 60 to 70
percent have some degree of infection, he said.
   To the north, Chelan County, which has 7,500 acres of pear
trees, has escaped the fireblight problem, although that area has
been hit in past years, Willett said.

<HEAD>EEC Says Leading Indicator Continued Recovery In March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community's
economic sentiment indicator recovered strongly in March amid
optimism about Europe's economic prospects for the next year, the
EEC Commission said Thursday.
   The indicator was at 103 in March, up 0.3 percentage points from
102.7 in February, and up 0.4 percentage points from 102.6 in
November 1987 when the indicator fell steeply in the aftermath of
the October stock market crash.
   The EEC's economic sentiment indicator is made up of an
industrial, construction and consumer confidence indicator and
share price indices.
   The Commission said in a statement that expectations for the
economy of the 12-nation trade bloc had brightened steadily since
November 1987.
   It said the March indicator confirmed ``no signs of an economic
downturn are discernible at the present time.''
   By comparison, the Commission said the leading U.S. indicator
improved ``appreciably'' in February for the first time since the
stock market crash. Japan's indicator was unchanged in January.
   The Commission said that the improvement in the value of the
dollar since the beginning of 1988 had strengthened export demand
and made assessments by European industry of export orders less
pessimistic.

<HEAD>American Stores Accepts FTC Requested Buyout Delay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MIMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Stores Co., the nation's
third-largest grocery chain, has agreed with federal regulators not
buy any shares of Lucky Stores Inc. until Saturday.
   A 10-day waiting period following filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission of American Stores' $2.5 billion buyout bid for
Lucky had expired Wednesday.
   However, the Federal Trade Commission asked the Salt Lake
City-based company not to purchase any shares of Lucky stock until
after 11:59 p.m. EDT Friday so federal regulators could review any
possible antitrust implications of the merger.
   In a brief statement released in New York by Executive Vice
President Michael T. Miller, American Stores said the agreement
with the Federal Trade Commission does not affect the timing of its
$65 per share cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Lucky
Stores, which is scheduled to expire at midnight EDT on June 1.
   American Stores officials in Salt Lake City declined to discuss
the development, saying they had no comment beyond the prepared
statement.
   In New York, Lissa Perlman of Kekst and Co., a public relations
firm representing Lucky, indicated the delay was not considered a
serious one.
   ``Things are progressing,'' she said of the buyout agreement.
She would not discuss any possible antitrust concerns.
   American Stores and Lucky officials announced they had reached
agreement on the buyout May 20. The deal terminated Lucky's April
28 deal to go private in a leveraged buyout led by the New York
firm Gibbons, Green van Amerongen Ltd. for $2.35 billion in cash
and stock.
   Analysts widely have speculated that if American Stores succeeds
in acquiring Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky, it will merge the company
with its weaker Alpha Beta chain in California.
   In announcing the buyout last week, American Stores Chairman
L.S. Skaggs said his company ``has always considered Lucky to be
the leading supermarket chain in California and is enthusiastic
about the combination of our Alpha Beta operations with those of
Lucky.''
   Lucky Stores has 480 stores and had $6.4 billion in 1987 sales,
while American Stores boasts 1,600 stores and $14.1 billion in
sales.
   Since it defeated a takeover attempt last year by New York
investor Asher B. Edleman, Lucky has been considered a desireable
takeover target.
   In order to hold off Edleman, the company sold off its
non-grocery divisions, plus stores in Arizona and Florida under a
restructuring plan. The company also paid $2.8 million of Edleman's
legal costs in return for his dropping the hostile takeover bid.
   To break off its buyout agreement with Gibbons, Green, Lucky
Stores agreed to pay the firm a $20 million fee plus expenses.
   American Stores offer, besides awaiting the outcome of the FTC
review, is subject to a majority of Lucky's 38.6 million shares
being tendered. American Stores officials have said they have
written commitments from commercial banks for all financing needed.

   The president of Honda of America Mfg.
Inc. is leaving the position to become managing director of the
Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co.'s worldwide manufacturing operations.
   The new assignment in Tokyo becomes effective June 30.
   Shoichiro Irimajiri, 48, will be replaced by Hiroyuki Yoshino,
general manager of Honda's Suzuka factory in Japan.
   ``I look forward to this new assignment because it represents an
opportunity to guide Honda's plan of establishing a worldwide
manufacturing network with a complementary international parts
sourcing network,'' Irimajiri said in a statement released by the
company Wednesday night.
   Irimajiri will be responsible for both planning and operations
for all Honda manufacturing worldwide, including auto, motorcycle
and power equipment, as well as quality control.
   Irimajiri joined Honda of America as president in May 1984.
Before that, he was general manager of the Suzuka factory and
executive vice president of Honda research and development at
Asaka, Japan.
   In 1982, at the age of 42, he was appointed a managing director
of Honda Motor Co. Ltd., the youngest ever.
   Yoshino, 48, joined Honda in 1963. He spent most of his career
in Honda research and development and was executive vice president
of R&D at Asaka. He also had primary responsibilities for both
Honda's international purchasing and data processing divisions.
   Honda, the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the United
States, began its operations here in September 1979 with production
at its motorcycle plant in Marysville, about 35 miles northwest of
Columbus. The motorcycle plant now employs about 320 people.
   The auto plant at Marysville, which began production in November
1982, employs about 3,700 people. The engine plant at Anna in
western Ohio began production in July 1985.

<TEXT>
   Japanese construction executives Thursday called
for the United States to lift its ban on Japanese bids for American
public works projects now that a construction dispute has been
formally settled.
   Japanese and U.S. officials signed an accord Wednesday in
Washington that provides for increased U.S. penetration of the
construction market here, smoothing over a 2-year-old dispute.
   ``We strongly hope that the office of the U.S. Trade
Representative will immediately reverse its decision to name Japan
as one of those countries that should be subject to exclusion''
from U.S. government-funded construction projects, said Hajime
Sako, chairman of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors,
in a statement.
   Taichiro Kumagai, chairman of the Japan Civil Engineering
Contractors' Association, urged the Japanese government in a
separate statement to internationalize Japan's contract bidding
process ``with a long-term perspective,'' Kyodo News Service
reported. Among the U.S. complaints was that bid-rigging was common.
   Kumagai also said U.S. construction companies should compete on
an equal footing with their Japanese counterparts if the American
construction industry is aggressive enough, Kyodo reported.
   Sako is chairman of Taisei Corp. and Kumagai is president of
Kumagai Gumi Co. Ltd. Both are among Japan's largest general
contractors.
   The Washington accord provides for Japan to encourage foreign
participation in major public works projects financed by the
Japanese government and other projects carried out by Japanese
companies with funding from both the central and local governments.
   The U.S. government had threatened to invoke legislation
allowing retaliatory trade moves against Japan for what Washington
perceived as an unfairly closed construction market.

<HEAD>Suchard Offers $4.3 Billion For Rowntree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rowntree PLC, the British confectioner that is
trying to keep two Swiss suitors at bay, on Thursday rejected a
2.32 billion pound, or $4.3 billion, offer from chocolate maker
Jacobs Suchard AG.
   Rowntree said the $17.77-a-share cash bid from Suchard, a
Zurich-based candy and coffee group that controls more than 29
percent of Rowntree, did not fully reflect the company's value.
   Investors apparently agree. Rowntree's stock was trading above
$18.50 a share Thursday on the London Stock Exchange.
   The bid was the latest development in the battle _ dubbed in
Britain as the ``candy bar wars'' _ between Suchard and Nestle SA
to gain control of Rowntree.
   Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland and holder of a 16-percent
stake in Rowntree, has offered $16.55 a share, or about $3.91
billion for the confectioner. Rowntree repeatedly has rebuffed
Nestle's overtures.
   On Wednesday, the British government cleared the way for
Nestle's bid by deciding not to refer the proposed takeover to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   The government also approved Suchard's stake in Rowntree in the
same manner but said a full bid by Suchard would need further
clearance.
   Immediately after the approvals were announced, Suchard said it
would seek Rowntree board approval for a possible cash bid or for
other means of joining the two companies' confectionery businesses.
   The Conservative government's clearances sparked a row in
Parliament, where opposition politicians and some Conservatives
attacked what they saw as the government's failure to ensure that
York-based Rowntree remains in British hands.
   Suchard aggressively began building its stake in Rowntree last
month, when it launched a ``dawn raid'' that took its holding to
14.9 percent.
   Nestle, saying Suchard forced its hand, then responded with a
bid for all of Rowntree.
   But this didn't stop Suchard from increasing its stake further
to just under 30 percent, the maximum it could hold under British
takeover regulations without launching a full takeover bid.

   Japanese exporters of computer printers
to the European Economic Community must pay anti-dumping duties
beginning May 27, the EEC Commission said Thursday.
   The anti-dumping duties followed an investigation that showed 14
Japanese companies were dumping _ selling at unfairly low prices _
in the 12 EEC member states.
   Sales of Japanese computer printers rose from 390,000 units in
1983 to 1.52 million in 1986, accounting for 73 percent of the EEC

about $1.3 billion.
   The EEC Commission said Brother Industries Ltd., Seiko Epson
Corp., Citizen Watch Co. Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp and Seikosha
Co. Ltd. must pay duties of 33.4 percent.
   In addition, the company said, Alps Electrical Co., must pay 7.4
percent; Copal Co. Ltd, 18.6 percent; Japan Business Computer Co.
Ltd., 22.4 percent; Nakajima Ltd., 12.3 percent; Oki Electric
Industry Co. Ltd., 9.2 percent; Shinwa Digital Industry Co. Ltd.,

   Stock prices held steady today as the market
absorbed the news of stronger economic growth in the first quarter
of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.00 to
1,963.37 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 400 up, 413 down and 511
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.08 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department said this morning that the gross
national product grew at a 3.9 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first three months of 1988. That
was up from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent.
   Many analysts had voiced concern earlier in the week that a
stronger figure would reinforce investors' worries about a possible
revival of inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   Rates rose in the government securities market following the
news. But brokers said traders evidently concluded that the
revision had already been taken into account in stock prices.
   Tenneco rose \ to 46 on top of a 4]-point gain Wednesday, when
the company said it planned to put its oil and gas properties up
for sale.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .17 to 143.94. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .59 at 291.17.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.16 to
1,961.37.
   Gainers outpaced losers by about 7 to 6 on the NYSE, with 784

   The U.S. economy, helped by the biggest
improvement in trade in eight years, expanded at a robust annual
rate of 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year, far
better than previously thought, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, performed far better from
January through March than it had estimated a month ago.
   At that time, the department put GNP growth at 2.3 percent.
   About four-fifths of the improvement from that first estimate
came from a narrowing of the foreign trade deficit, which shrank in
inflation-adjusted terms at an annual rate of $16.7 billion in the
first three months of the year.
   This represented the sharpest narrowing of the trade deficit
since a $24.8 billion drop in the first quarter of 1980.
   The trade improvement had been estimated as a much smaller $3.6
billion last month, but that was before the government had data for
exports and imports in March, a month when the trade deficit shrank
sharply because of a record level of exports.
   Economists had been expecting an upward revision in the GNP
report, but the 3.9 percent growth rate was far above most
estimates. The consensus outlook had expected a GNP increase of 3.2
percent.
   ``The economy is on a roll. It is amazingly strong and resilient
for such an aging expansion,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
for the Boston Co.
   Sinai said he was revising his estimate of growth for all of
1988 up to 3.5 percent, which would be the fastest growth pace
since 1984.
   ``It looks like President Reagan is going out in a blaze of
glory on the real economy,'' Sinai said. ``The growth in the first
quarter pretty much locks in a good growth rate for the year.''
   The economic performance this year is far different than the
fears raised in the wake of the stock market crash last fall. At
that time, many economists said the country could well topple into
a recession this year caused by consumer fears about the stock
market downturn.
   The strong economic growth has buried recession fears for this
year, but now financial markets have become concerned that the
economy may be expanding so rapidly that inflation will be
rekindled.
   But the new GNP report did not support any inflation worries.
The revised report showed that an inflation index which measures
prices of a selection of goods rose at an annual rate of just 1.7
percent in the first three months of the year, down from a 2.7
percent rate in the fourth quarter. It was the lowest rise in
inflation since late 1986.
   The Reagan administration has predicted that the economy will
expand at an annual rate of 2.9 percent for all of 1988. The
government said that growth as low as 1.9 percent would be all that
was needed to meet that forecast. Many private economists have been
busy revising their growth estimates upward for 1988.
   ``If you take all the evidence that is available, you would have
to come to the conclusion that the economy is going to do quite
well for the rest of the year,'' said Hugh Johnson, an analyst with
First Albany Corp.
   The 3.9 percent January-March GNP growth rate followed an even
faster 4.8 percent increase in the October-December quarter.
   But the fourth quarter growth masked some dangerous imbalances
that were not present in the first quarter figure.
   Almost all of the fourth quarter increase in the GNP wound up as
unsold inventories sitting on shelves. At the same time, consumer
spending was taking a rare nose dive, falling by 2.5 percent, the
biggest decline in seven years. That combination has often
signalled an impending recession.
   But in the first quarter, consumer spending bounced back, rising
at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, with about half of that increase
attributed to stronger car sales.
   Business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual
rate of 32.8 percent in the first quarter, the fastest advance
since the first year of the recovery from the 1981-82 recession.
   Analysts said much of the investment boom was directly tied to
trade improvements as American companies have rushed to expand
production facilities to meet the surge in export demand.
   ``Businesses apparently decided that the market crash would not
affect them because they were depending on an export boom this
year, not increased domestic demand,'' said Michael Evans, head of
a Washington forecasting firm.
   In another report, the government said today that after-tax
corporate profits rose by 0.5 percent in the first quarter, a
modest gain which followed a much bigger 2.6 percent rise in the
fourth quarter.
   The various changes left the GNP rising by $37.2 billion in the
first quarter, an annual level of $3.92 trillion.

<HEAD>Ford To Meet Fuel Economy Rules Rather Than Seek Reprieve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will meet the 27.5
miles-per-gallon fuel economy standard for its 1989 fleet rather
than seek a reduction in the standard from the federal government,
a Ford executive said.
   Ford will meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE,
standard drawn up by Congress in 1975 by selling more small cars in
1989, said Philip E. Benton Jr., president of the Ford Automotive
Group.
   CAFE is the average fuel economy rating of the vehicles each
automaker sells in the United States during a model year, which
begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30.
   That means that a company whose large cars sell better than its
small cars could be penalized because its average fuel economy is
too low.
   The U.S. Transportation Department lowered the standard from
27.5 mpg to 26 mpg three years ago at the request of Ford and
General Motors Corp., the nation's two largest automakers.
   Chrysler Corp., the third-largest U.S. automaker, argued against
the change because its fleet met the 27.5 mpg standard.
   Ford and GM had argued that low, stable gasoline prices had
increased demand for larger and luxury cars. The companies
threatened to cut big car production and lay off workers to meet
the standard rather than pay stiff fines for selling the larger
vehicles.
   GM and the Automobile Importers of America, which represents all
Japanese automakers and all but two European makers, have asked
that the 27.5 mpg standard for 1989 be reduced to 26 mpg standard
that was in effect for 1986, 1987 and 1988 models.
   Benton said Ford would break with the other automakers and added
that Ford is continuously reducing the weight of its cars and
engines.
   ``We're effecting change in that way and we also are using heavy
marketing actions. We're selling every small car we possibly can to
bring down the average,'' Benton said Wednesday.
   Ford also will use credits built up in previous years when its
fleet's average fuel economy exceeded the standards, he said.
   Benton was in Monroe to present a quality award to the Monroe
stamping plant.

   Many analysts had voiced concern earlier in the week that a
stronger figure would reinforce investors' worries about a possible
revival of inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   Rates rose in the government securities market following the
news. But brokers said traders evidently concluded that the
revision had already been taken into account in stock prices.
   Texaco made a big contribution to the Dow Jones industrials'
rise, climbing 3\ to 50[. Late Wednesday Carl Icahn, the company's
largest shareholder, proposed to offer $60 a share to take it over.
   Tenneco rose } to 46{ on top of a 4]-point gain Wednesday, when
the company said it planned to put its oil and gas properties up
for sale.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .47 to 144.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .89 at 291.47.

   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, then turned mixed as some
meteorologists offered drier weather forecasts.
   Analysts attributed the lower opening primarily to
follow-through selling after Wednesday's sharp declines, especially
in the soybean pit.
   Wednesday's losses were sparked by predictions for rain in the
Midwest early next week. But some of today's early forecasts
offered a drier outlook, and bullish traders began buying contracts
on any significant dip in prices, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in
New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Wheat prices also were pressured by the Agriculture Department's
authorization of a program that will allow sharply higher wheat
production next year, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents to 6 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.39 a bushel; corn was \ cent to

<TEXT>
   Several academic experts, consultants,
governors, energy companies and advocacy organizations today
announced the formation of a new group that will try to restore the
notion of an impending energy crisis to the nation's consciousness.
   ``Energy policy has fallen off the national agenda,'' said one
of the organizers of the group, Gov. George A. Sinner of North
Dakota, even though ``polls indicate that national leaders and the
American public are convinced there will be another energy crisis.''
   The president of the new, Denver-based group, the American
Energy Assurance Council, John Jenkins, said the group will try
``to grapple with conflicting solutions,'' such as the
conservation-at-any-price vision backed by some environmental
organizations and the expand-production-everywhere solution of some
oil companies.
   ``There is no set agenda,'' said Michael Beatty, senior vice
president and general council of Coastal Corp., a Houston-based oil
and gas producer. ``We are working together with people whose views
we vehemently disagree with.''
   Charles Ebinger, an industry consultant and staff member at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said
the group had taken about a year to form, and the organizers had
difficulty persuading some participants it was not just a front for
oil companies.
   But the participation of well-known conservation advocate Amory
Lovins helped overcome that suspicion, he said.

   A utility today tentatively agreed to give
up the $5.3 billion Shoreham nuclear plant for $1 and let the state
dismantle it. It would be the first time a completed U.S. atomic
plant was abandoned before it opened.
   Under the agreement, Long Island Lighting Co. would pay the more
than $400 million to decommission the plant on Long Island, 55
miles east of Manhattan, but would be guaranteed 5 percent rate
increases in each of the next three years.
   ``We have gotten everything we wanted,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said
at a news conference today.
   The agreement would allow financially troubled LILCO to continue
to operate as a privately owned utility. The state had threatened a
takeover of the entire company.
   Utility spokesman James Lois confirmed the agreement but
withheld detailed comment.
   Once completed, the deal will end years of attempts by
environmentalists, local activists and others to close Shoreham,
situated on Long Island's North Shore.
   ``I think that utilities throughout the United States will be
very mindful of what happened to the Long Island Lighting
Company,'' said Irving Like of Bay Shore, a Shoreham opponent and a
member of the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), a board the state
set up to examine a possible takeover of the utility.
   The plant, conceived in 1965, was completed in 1984, 10 years
late and more than 80 times over budget. It never has opened
because of the refusal of state and local officials to approve an
emergency evacuation plan.
   The officials had argued that Long Island, because of its
geography, could not be safely evacuation during a nuclear accident
and without such approval the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission
had refused to issue an operating license.
   State efforts to close Shoreham accelerated after the NRC in
October eliminated the rule requiring state and local government
participation in an evacuation plan.
   The entire agreement must be approved by the state Public
Service Commission, and some parts of it need the Legislature's
approval. New generating plants would then be built on Long Island
to ensure an adequate supply of electricity.
   The accord was announced 95 minutes after Cuomo's midnight
Wednesday deadline for an agreement. Earlier, Cuomo threatened to
call off negotiations and resume a lawsuit to keep Shoreham closed
if LILCO failed to agree to a deal.
   The settlement provides a prototype for opponents of other
nuclear plants because it had been widely believed that once
Shoreham was completed, it would be licensed despite state and
local government opposition, said Harold Holzer, an aide to Vincent
Tese, Cuomo's chief negotiator in the deal.
   The future of the plant has been in limbo for years and the
delays in construction and the licensing effort, along with massive
cost overruns, drove LILCO to near bankruptcy.
   In addition to fears over Shoreham's safety, negotiations have
been driven by the fact that LILCO's nearly 1 million customers pay
the second highest electricity rates in the country, second only to
neighboring Consolidated Edison.
   The utility's problems were highlighted after Hurricane Gloria
in September 1985 knocked out power to more than 80 percent of
LILCO's customers.

<TEXT>
   Suits being filed nationwide against Chrysler
Corp. have delayed payments of at least $500 each to owners of
Chrysler cars sold after being test-driven while their odometers
were disconnected.
   Chrysler, the nation's third-largest automaker, agreed last year
to pay about $16 million to more than 32,000 owners but will not
pay the money until the settlement is approved late this summer by
U.S. District Court Judge John Nangle in St. Louis.
   Approval of the settlement has been delayed in part by continued
filing of class-action suits against Chrysler nationwide, said
Marcia Aud, Nangle's deputy clerk. The suits must be consolidated
and heard in St. Louis.
   So far, Aud said, 38 suits have been filed against Chrysler by
owners and state attorneys general, ``and we're still adding new
ones.''
   Chrysler pleaded no contest last year to federal charges of
odometer tampering contained in an indictment handed down in St.
Louis. The investigation was launched in Missouri after state
police noticed in several instances in which traffic citations were
issued to Chrysler employees that the odometer read zero and
speedometer was out of commission.
   Chrysler stopped disconnecting odometers in October 1986 after
learning of the government investigation.
   Chrysler also extended the warranty on the cars to seven years
or 70,000 miles from the standard five years or 50,000 miles. The
warranty is in effect despite delays in the settlement, Chrysler
spokesman Steve Harris said.
   Last July, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said selling cars
tested with disconnected odometers was ``dumb'' and that selling
cars damaged during the testing went ``beyond dumb and reached all
the way to stupid.''
   All automakers disconnected odometers during testing at one
time, but General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. halted the
practice in the 1970s.

<HEAD>Honda Says Earnings Rose 63.2 Percent In Latest Fiscal Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. said its profit from
consolidated, worldwide operations rose 63.2 percent in its latest
fiscal quarter as revenue climbed 3.4 percent.
   The automaker said its results were helped by increased car
sales in Japan, cost-cutting efforts, successful currency hedging,
and improved profits from non-consolidated subsidiaries and
affiliates.
   Honda said it made a profit of 33.0 billion yen, or $264
million, in the three months ended March 31, which was a
transitional quarter because the company is changing to a new
fiscal year. The results were compared to the profit of 20.2
billion yen in the quarter ended Feb. 28, 1987.
   Honda's revenue rose to 795 billion yen, or $6.36 billion, in
the quarter ended March 31, from 769 billion yen in the quarter
ended Feb. 28, 1987.
   For the latest six-month period, Honda's profit rose 51.7
percent to 56.7 billion yen, or $453 million, from 37.4 billion yen
in the six months ended Feb. 28, 1987. Revenue rose 11.3 percent to
1,585 billion yen, or $12.7 billion, from 1,424 billion yen a year
earlier.
   Honda is changing to a fiscal year beginning April 1 instead of
March 1. It used an exchange rate of 125 yen to the dollar to
calculate the dollar value of its profits and revenue.

<TEXT>
   Thanks in part to the new-found popularity
of its 757 twinjet, Boeing Co. appears headed for its fourth
consecutive year of record commercial jet orders, industry analysts
say.
   The giant aerospace company may be entering a sellers' market
for aircraft, and an order announced Wednesday by American Airlines
for as many as 100 of the 757s may be one of the last at bargain
prices, the analysts believe.
   American said it was ordering 50 757s for delivery between July
1989 and November 1991, with an option to purchase 50 more for
delivery through December 1993. Robert W. Baker, American's vice
president for operations, declined to give exact figures, but said
the deal was on ``very favorable terms for American'' with the firm
order worth slightly more than $2 billion and the second 50 planes
about the same.
   Today, United Airlines announced it was ordering 30 757s, with
options on 30 more. United Chairman Stephen M. Wolf placed the
value of his company's order at more than $2 billion.
   And 10 days ago, International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly
Hills, Calif., ordered 100 Boeing jetliners and took options for 24
more. The $4.6 billion price  $25 billion in
1988 orders was possible.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton on Wednesday
acknowledged that 1988 could see a record, but said he felt
uncomfortable saying Boeing was on a roll.
   ``It can't keep up at this pace,'' he said. ``The past three
years have been successive record years in terms of orders. I don't
think it can continue, but I wouldn't hazard a guess as to when it
will end.''
   Thornton said it's a coincidence that Boeing is receiving large
orders in quick succession. But Demisch and others say now may be
the time to buy.
   ``We're moving toward a sellers' market for airplanes,'' Demisch
said, adding that as orders continue to build, aircraft prices
could rise by 10 percent to 20 percent.
   ``The desire to sort of get in before the gates close and prices
go up is not far from the airlines' mind,'' he said.
   Nisbet said the recent huge orders may ``encourage everyone to
hurry up and get their place in line'' for new aircraft needed in
the 1990s.
   Demisch said ``American got a very good deal'' at a price of
roughly $40 million a plane. Depending on configuration, 757s
normally sell for $41 million to $47 million each.
   American's new jets will primarily replace its aging Boeing 737s
and 727s, Baker said. The 194-passenger 757 jetliner, with a range
of about 3,300 miles, burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable
aircraft and will be powered by two Rolls Royce engines.
   The 50 additional planes, if ordered, would be delivered through
December 1993. In an interview with The Seattle Times last week,
American President and Chairman Robert Crandall said the airline
could order yet another 100 757s by the end of the century.
   Baker said American chose the 757 because of its economy,
quietness, and because crews flying the widebody Boeing 767s in
American's fleet can easily switch to the smaller jet. Also, he
said, more than half the parts in 767s are interchangeable with
those in 757s.
   Boeing launched the 757 in 1978 as a high-technology,
fuel-stingy replacement for its 727 tri-jet, which entered service
in 1964. But a drop in fuel prices stalled sales, with just 239
757s ordered through 1987.
   ``I think most of you know that we've been probably a little
disappointed with the 757 over the years,'' Thornton said.
   That's changed, with 90 of the planes ordered this year.
   Baker said the 757 makes sense with growing passenger demand
coupled with growing airport congestion. He said the ``realization
that those of us who are going to survive deregulation must begin
the process of retiring the first generation of aircraft makes this
airplane really kind of come into its own and be recognized for its
merits.''
   He said American wasn't rushed into the order, but had studied
it for months. ``You're betting your company when you buy a fleet
of 50 or 100 airplanes,'' he said. ``You want to be darn sure
you've looked at everything you can think of.''
   Thornton said Boeing plans to increase 757 production at its
Renton plant from four to five a month sometime next year. However,
he said Boeing doesn't expect to need to hire many new workers.

<TEXT>
   Writers will be able to reach their public by
computer in June when a Florida company introduces a way to browse
through books electronically.
   ``We consider this the latest exercise of First Amendment
rights,'' said company president Joe Barcheski.
   The BookMart database will allow authors to reach readers
without going through the grueling process of submitting and
rewriting manuscripts for a publisher's approval.
   The database will also allow publishers to scan new books.
   BookMart is the brainchild of writer Samuel Bleecker, who along
with two partners have formed PubTronix, based in Pompano Beach,
Fla.
   The on-line computer service will provide access to five pages
of text and a book-jacket description of each volume for the price
to the shopper of a telephone call.
   The author or publishing company, however, will have to pay $250
a year for each computer listing.
   After browsing listings by subject, author or title, readers can
order a work by credit card and get it on a floppy disk, or in book
form if it has been published, Barcheski said.
   PubTronix announced BookMart last weekend at the Florida State
Writer's Conference in an effort to attract unpublished writers
seeking a forum outside the publishing world.
   ``In the next few weeks we will also be competing agreements
with several publishers'' for listings, Barcheski said.
   BookMart will go on line sometime in mid-June with about 1,000
titles listed and hopes to expand to as many as 10,000 titles, he
said. The on-line telephone number to RAC Information Systems in
Great Neck, N.Y., will be advertised in computer magazines and on
electonic billboards nationally when the start-up date is set,
Barcheski said.
   In addition to books, Barcheski, Bleecker, and Herb Rubinsky,
president of RAC, plan to use the database to sell rare books, such
as first editions and those carrying an autograph that would be of
interest to a national audience. The men also intend to begin
compiling magazine articles with RAC's staff of 30.
   Eventually, the men want to offer BookMart in kiosk units to
book stores as a way to boost selection without being buried in
inventory, Barcheski said.
   ``With a BookMart listing, a publisher can effectively reach the
home shopper and in the near future, the book store browser for a
very low cost,'' said Bleecker. ``Publishers are, therefore, no
longer required to distribute physical inventory to have a
nationwide audience.''

   United Airlines today ordered 30 Boeing 757-200
jetliners and took options for 30 more, giving Boeing Commercial
Airplanes its third multibillion-dollar order for aircraft in two
weeks.
   United's firm order for 30 jets is valued at more than $1.3
billion, Boeing said. Deliveries of the jets are to be over a
three-year period beginning in 1989.
   United has chosen Pratt & Whitney engines to power its new
planes, which will be outfitted to accommodate 192 passengers in
two classes.
   On Wednesday, American Airlines announced it was ordering 50
757s worth more than $2 billion and taking options on an addition
50. On May 16, International Lease Finance Corp. ordered 100 Boeing
planes and took options on 24 more, a deal with a total value of
$4.6 billion, a Boeing record for a single order.
   ``It's been a very pleasant week, hasn't it?'' Boeing spokesman
Jim Boynton said in confirming the order. He repeated Boeing's
earlier statements that the new work would mean no new major hiring
at Boeing's 757 assembly plant in the Seattle suburb of Renton.
   In Chicago, United Chairman Stephen M. Wolf placed the value of
his company's order at more than $2 billion and said United chose
the 757 because of its cost-efficient operation.
   ``Our objective in returning to to our core business of running
an airline is to grow United Airlines and to establish it as this
nation's pre-eminent airline,'' Wolf said in a statement.
   ``The 757 will strenthen our domestic network and with operating
efficiencies that will enable us to compete more efficiently,'' he
said.
   United will take delivery of its first 757 in August 1989, Wolf
said. The delivery schedule for the first 30 airplanes calls for
delivery of six in 1989, 21 in 1990 and three in 1991.
   Delivery of more 757s depends on the airline's ability to
produce a consistent level of earnings, Wolf said.
   The 757 is a twin-engine, short-to-medium range jetliner and is
the most fuel-efficient aircraft Boeing builds. It also is designed
to meet the most stringent noise and operational restrictions at
U.S. airports.
   Boeing has had 356 jets ordered in 1988 with an estimated value
of $14.9 billion. That's just 10 fewer than the 366 Boeing
commercial jets ordered for all of 1987. The value of 1987 jet
orders was $19.9 billion, a company record.
   Industry analysts say Boeing could be headed for its
fourth-straight year of record orders, with some predicting a total
of up to $25 billion.
   Boeing has had 120 firm orders for 757s this year. Until
recently, the plane was a disappointment for Boeing, which only had
239 orders for the twinjet from 1978 through 1987. However,
industry officials say the plane's fuel efficiency, larger size and
availability in the early 1990s have brought it new popularity.
   United said it would finance part of the transaction through the
sale of its McDonnell Douglas DC-8 fleet to GPA Corp., a subsidiary
of GPA Group Ltd, based in Shannon, Ireland. The DC-8s are less
fuel-efficient than the 757s.
   United, which was started by Boeing, Pratt & Whitney and three
other companies in 1929, is Boeing's largest customer. With the new
order, United has purchased 528 jetliners from Boeing, including
all models the company has built.
   United and Boeing severed corporate ties in 1934.
   The announcement came at a meeting at which shareholders
approved a change in the name of United's parent company from
Allegis Corp. to UAL Corp.
   The company, formerly UAL, adopted the name Allegis in February
1987 as part of an ill-fated effort to structure itself as a
travel-and-hotel conglomerate. The ensuing stockholder uproar
forced the resignation of then-Chairman Richard Ferris and led to a
sell-off of all of the company's holdings except United.
   United already has taken delivery of 22 737-300s, part of an
order of 110 from Boeing, and will begin taking delivery of 15
747-400s next year, spokesman Joe Hopkins said.

   The first Toyota produced in Kentucky
rolled off an assembly line Thursday and was greeted by cheers from
the plant's 1,100 employees.
   The white, four-door Camry sedan with a sunroof rolled onto an
80-foot stage to the applause of the employees and Toyota
officials. Its appearance was greeted by flashing lights and the
Toyota theme song.
   The car then went through a quality inspection and Katsuro
Nakamura, general manager of the Toyota plant in Japan, gave an OK
sign.
   ``This car is a symbol of our most important company principle,
teamwork,'' said Kaneyoshi Kusunoki, president of Toyota Motor
Manufacturing, U.S.A., Inc.
   The car rolled out Thursday was a pilot vehicle. Commercial
production is expected to begin in mid-summer.
   Full production will be reached in early 1989 with one shift
turning out 400 cars per day. Another shift will be added next
year, giving the plant an annual quota of 200,000 vehicles annually.
   Ground for the $800 million plant was broken May 5, 1986. A $300
million expansion to add a power train plant, which will produce
engine axles and steering components, was announced Nov. 9, 1987,
bringing the total investment in Kentucky to $1.1 billion.
   The Kentucky plant is Toyota's second in the United States. Its
first is a 50-50 joint venture with General Motors Corp. in
Fremont, Calif., called New United Motors Manufacturing Inc.
   NUMMI uses a GM plant previously shuttered because of
troublesome labor relations.
   Unlike Honda, which began producing cars on its own in the
United States in 1982, Toyota was more cautious and waited to gauge
the success of the NUMMI experiment before making the heavy
investment required to build its own plant.
   The Georgetown plant is considered the largest under one roof in
the United States.

   Grain and soybean futures closed lower Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade with wheat prices down sharply on
concerns about increased production next year.
   The Agriculture Department approved a new wheat price-support
program Wednesday that will allow greater wheat production next
year, a prospect seen as strongly negative for prices, analysts
said.
   Mixed forecasts for weekend weather also pressured the markets,
with most traders expecting significant rainfall before the end of
the long Memorial Day weekend, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in
New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``The wheat crop is maturing and rain would be very helpful as
the crop starts to `head' out there,'' Spilka said. Heading refers
to a critical phase of the wheat ripening process.
   Soybean futures closed well above their session lows, an
indication of the market's persistently positive tone, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 4\ cents to 10 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.37 a bushel; corn was 2 cents
to 4{ cents lower with July at $2.12} a bushel; oats were } cent to
1 cent lower with July at $1.71 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to
14{ cents lower with July at $7.55 a bushel.

   Stock prices inched ahead today as the market
absorbed the news of stronger economic growth in the first quarter
of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.89 to 1,964.26 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 706 up, 600 down and
579 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department said this morning that the gross
national product grew at a 3.9 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first three months of 1988. That
was up from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent.
   Many analysts had voiced concern earlier in the week that a
stronger figure would reinforce investors' worries about a possible
revival of inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   Rates rose in the government securities market following the
news. But brokers said traders evidently concluded that the
revision had already been taken into account in stock prices.
   Texaco by itself accounted for the Dow Jones industrials' rise,
climbing 2~ to 49}. Late Wednesday Carl Icahn, the company's
largest shareholder, proposed to offer $60 a share to take it over.
   Tenneco rose | to 46] on top of a 4]-point gain Wednesday, when
the company said it planned to put its oil and gas properties up
for sale.
   Sears Roebuck led the active list, unchanged at 34\ in trading
largely attributed to strategies focused on the company's dividend.
   U.S. Shoe fell ~ to 17|. The company reported lower earnings for
the fiscal quarter that ended April 30.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .27 to 144.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .76 at 291.34.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 143.25 million shares with an

<HEAD>Forecast: Crash to Cost Wall Street 26,000 Jobs by January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street has lost 8,200 jobs since October's
stock market crash and likely will shed another 18,000 workers by
year's end, an economist said Thursday.
   The report by New York University Professor Matthew P. Drennan
was slightly more optimistic than his forecast late last year that
the securities industry in New York would lose 28,000 jobs by the
end of 1988 because of the crash.
   Drennan revised his prediction to about 26,000 because trading
volume on the New York Stock Exchange held up better than expected
during the first quarter of 1988.
   ``However, that support for employment is now crumbling,'' he
said.
   Market volume last month was 17 percent lower than in April
1987, and so far this month is 12 percent off last May's level,
Drennan, of NYU's Urban Research Center, said in an annual economic
report.
   ``This pattern of greatly reduced volume of stock trading is
expected to continue through the remainder of 1988. Consequently,
securities industry employment in the city is likely to take
another big hit,'' he said.
   Other reports have made similar forecasts. The state
comptroller's office in December predicted the loss of 20,000
securities industry jobs in 1988.

<HEAD>Shoreham Abandonment May be First of Many Blows to Nuclear
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tentative decision to close the $5.3
billion Shoreham reactor on Long Island, N.Y., may be only the
first of several severe blows awaiting the nation's troubled
nuclear power industry.
   An agreement reached early Thursday between the Long Island
Lighting Co. and New York state would result in the abandonment of
Shoreham, which, though complete, has never generated commercial
power. It would be the first U.S. nuclear plant to be scuttled
without ever operating.
   A similar fate may await the equally costly Seabrook nuclear
plant in New Hampshire. Like Shoreham, Seabrook has been embroiled
in legal and political problems over the issue of whether residents
and tourists in its much-traveled resort area could be safely
evacuated in the event of a major emergency.
   Adding to Seabrook's woes is the recent declaration of
bankruptcy by the plant's owner, Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire. Gov. John Sununu recently said the bankruptcy filing may
actually be a blessing in disguise, allowing a new financial
package to be put together that could put Seabrook back on track.
   But many financial analysts doubt that, and Democratic
presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis, who if elected would
appoint a new Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is foresworn to close
the reactor.
   In addition to Seabrook, more than a dozen other plants are in
deep trouble. Voters in the Sacramento, Calif., area will decide in
June whether to close the long-plagued Rancho Seco plant owned by
Sacramento Municipal Utility District.
   The Pilgrim plant in Massachusetts, owned by Boston Edison, will
be the subject of a similar referendum in November.
   Rancho Seco and Pilgrim were singled out recently by an
anti-nuclear group, Public Citizen, as the two worst commercial
nuclear plants in the nation. The group, virtually duplicating a
``worst'' list put out a year earlier by the NRC, also named 14
other plants as candidates for permanent shutdown.
   Among them are two Peach Bottom reactors in Pennsylvania, shut
down by the NRC last year after federal investigators found plant
operators sleeping on duty, and several plants belonging to the
Tennessee Valley Authority, whose nuclear program has been
embroiled in a wide variety of management and safety problems.
   All five of TVA's operating reactors were shut down in 1985 for
safety improvements, and only one, Sequoyah Unit 2, was allowed
just recently to restart. Meanwhile, TVA had to cancel plans to
build eight other reactors, and construction, already under way, of
four others was slowed.
   While TVA hopes to restart all the facilities closed in 1985,
the future of those under construction remains dark.
   The industry insists the overall outlook for nuclear power is
good, if not bright. It points to an increase of 10 percent last
year in electrical generation and an improved safety and efficiency
record, in which sudden shudowns dropped to 2.7 per reactor,
compared with 3.9 the previous year and 7.4 in 1980.
   But the fact remains that many reactors are candidates for
closure, and no utility has planned a new nuclear power plant since
the 1970s.
   Among other plants cited by Public Citizen and the NRC as
problem reactors are Fermi No. 2 in Michigan, Oyster Creek in New
Jersey, three Browns Ferry TVA units in Alabama, Davis-Besse in
Ohio, Dresden No. 2 in Illinois, Fort St. Vrain in Colorado and
Byron No. 1 in Illinois.

   Assets of the nation's 429 money market mutual
funds fell $1.79 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $273.31 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $3.70 billion increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 214 general purpose funds increased $163.6 million to
$84.07 billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds fell $63.9 million
to $115.72 billion, and assets of 118 institutional funds fell
$1.89 billion to $73.52 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.29 percent from 6.27 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.21 percent from 6.17 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
39 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts was 5.70 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.12 percent from 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7 percent
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 6.95 percent the
previous week. Yields were 7.34 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.28
percent; 7.73 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.70 percent; and
8.21 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.18 percent.

   The dollar drifted aimlessly in light dealings
Thursday and finished the day marginally higher against several
major currencies.
   Gold prices edged downward. Republic National Bank of New York
said gold was bid at $453.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
from $453.75 an ounce late Wednesday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was little affected by
an upward revision of first-quarter figures for the U.S. gross
national product to 3.9 percent from the 2.3 percent reported
earlier.
   Fears that the economy's strength would add to inflation were
restrained by a companion report saying the annual inflation rate
edged down to just 1.7 percent in the first quarter.
   The dollar declined slightly late in the U.S. trading session,
but nothing nudged it out of the narrow range in which it has
remained for weeks.
   ``We're anticipating it's going to be a pretty dull summer,''
said James Chorek, an analyst for Money Market Services Inc. in
Chicago.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8625 late Thursday from
$1.8650. Later in New York, sterling fell to $1.8611 from $1.8631
late Wednesday.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.50 Japanese yen, up from
124.30 late Wednesday. In later London trading, the dollar was
quoted at 124.43 yen. At the end of the trading day in New York,
the dollar rose to 124.58 yen from 124.42 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates in late U.S. trading, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7086 West German marks, up from
1.7064; 1.4233 Swiss francs, up from 1.4238; 5.7565 French francs,
down from 5.7583; and 1,267.75 Italian lire, up from 1,265.38; and
1.2364 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2427.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7080 West German marks, up from
1.7045; 1.4257 Swiss francs, up from 1.4245; 5.7620 French francs,
up from 5.7550; 1.9125 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9090; 1,268.00
Italian lire, up from 1,264.50; and 1.2374 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2434.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $452.42 a troy ounce, down from
$460.27 late Wednesday.
   Later, gold bullion fell to a bid $453.30 a troy ounce in
London, down from $454, and to $454 bid in Zurich, down from
$454.50. At the end of the trading day, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $454.10 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, from $454.40 an ounce late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.63 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.67. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $6.610 a troy ounce from $6.592 an ounce late
Wednesday.

   The rapid growth of Compaq Computer Corp., which
surpassed $1 billion in sales in record time, is expected to slow
significantly because of a shortage of computer memory chips,
officials said.
   Neither computer industry analysts nor Compaq executives would
estimate how big of an impact the chip shortage will have except to
say that the company's growth will be less robust.
   ``I don't think they will go backward, but they won't have that
rapid growth rate of the past,'' said Bob Greiner, marketing
manager for the Dallas research firm StoreBoard Inc. ``To what
extent they will be affected is still in question.''
   For the first three months of the year, Compaq's sales more than
doubled over the same period a year ago, increasing to $439 million
from $211 million. Net income rose to $47 million from $20 million
last year.
   Compaq is the world's leading manufacturer of portable personal
computers and a leading manufacturer of desktop personal computers.
The Houston-based company made U.S. business history by being the
first company to break the $1 billion mark in sales within five
years of starting up.
   Rod Canion, Compaq's chief executive officer, said Wednesday
that the company's second quarter sales would suffer because of the
memory chip shortage.
   ``There will be some impact on sales, although it is hard to
estimate how big it will be in the second quarter,'' Canion said.
   Canion said he does not expect the company's growth in sales and
earnings to match 1987's growth rate. Last week, he told
shareholders at the company's annual meeting that the rapid
quarterly percentage growth would slow down.
   Compaq will not be suffering from the chip shortage alone. Most
computer manufacturers are scrambling for memory chips. Some other
major companies complaining about the pinch are Apple Computer Inc.
and Sun Microsystems Inc.
   ``The shortage will affect most manufacturers to some extent,''
Greiner said.
   Industry observers blame the chip shortage on several factors,
including production cuts by Japanese semiconductor makers after
the introduction of tariffs by the United States last year.
   The most serious shortage has been for dynamic random access
memory, or DRAM, semiconductors, which are the most widely used
computer memory chips.
   Japanese companies produce more than 75 percent of the DRAM
chips sold worldwide, and some analysts say the majority of these
chips are going to Japanese computer makers.

   Stock prices pieced together a small gain
Thursday as the market absorbed the news of stronger economic
growth in the first quarter of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.38 to 1,966.75.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
787 up, 592 down and 543 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.26 million
shares, up from 138.31 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 187.85 million shares.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday morning that the gross
national product grew at a 3.9 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first three months of 1988. That
was up from a previous estimate of 2.3 percent.
   Many analysts had voiced concern earlier in the week that a
stronger figure would reinforce investors' worries about a possible
revival of inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   Rates rose in the government securities market following the
news, amid conjecture that the Federal Reserve was tightening
credit a bit further.
   But brokers said traders evidently concluded that the revision
had already been taken into account in stock prices.
   Texaco accounted for most of the Dow Jones industrials' rise,
climbing 3[ to 50. Late Wednesday Carl Icahn, the company's largest
shareholder, proposed to offer $60 a share to take it over.
   USX, another company in which Icahn holds a stake, gained 1 to
30{.
   Tenneco slipped [ to 45| after gained 4] Wednesday, when the
company said it planned to put its oil and gas properties up for
sale.
   Newhall Land & Farming jumped 4] to 44{. Late in the day the
company said it wasn't involved in any talks about being acquired.
   Long Island Lighting rose 1\ to 11]. The utility reached an
agreement with New York state officials to settle a long dispute
involving its Shoreham nuclear power plant, which is to be
dismantled.
   Sears Roebuck led the active list, up \ at 34{ in trading
largely attributed to strategies focused on the company's dividend.
   U.S. Shoe fell ~ to 17|. The company reported lower earnings for
the fiscal quarter that ended April 30.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.37 billion, or 0.37
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.46 to 144.23.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .74 to 294.31, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .87 at 254.63.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.69 to 339.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 292.06, up 1.48.

   Students shouting ``Go Home Yankees!''
attacked an American bank with rocks and firebombs Thursday, and
farmers protesting U.S. agricultural imports hurled cow dung at
police during a clash outside the National Assembly.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jai ordered a crackdown on violent
protests and radicals, but the mandate seemed to have little effect
on the wave of anti-American rage.
   About 30 students dashed out of sidestreets and hurled rocks and
firebombs at a branch in southern Seoul of the KorAm Bank, police
said. Police said four people were arrested.
   The bank, a joint venture between the Bank of America and Korean
business groups, was not damaged. It had not yet opened for
business and had shutters over the windows and entrance.
   Riot police fired tear gas in front of the National Assembly
building in Seoul to disperse farmers protesting plans to increase
imports of U.S. agricultural products.
   At least five people were injured.
   About 500 farmers, with two calves at the front, hurled cow dung
and clashed with police after a rally attended by about 1,500
farmers. Police kicked and punched the protesters, who shouted
``Oppose American beef and its pressure to open the Korean market!''
   One calf ran amok through 1,000 riot police surrounding the
assembly compound.
   The United States is pushing South Korea to widen its markets to
American imports. The trade issue has fanned anti-U.S. sentiment.
   The attack on the bank was the first on U.S. business interests
in the wave of violent protests that have been aimed mainly at the
United States.
   A senior government official said Wednesday that the
anti-American sentiment of the radical students is not shared by
most Koreans.
   Hyun Hong-choo, minister of legislation, said: ``We are
confident the majority of the people are happy with our relations
with the United States.'' He was commenting at a lunch with the
press about the recent unrest.
   Radical students blame the United States for the partition of
the Korean peninsula and accuse Washington of supporting military
rule in the South. They demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   The Korean peninsula was divided by U.S. and Soviet troops that
ended the Japanese occupation in 1945 at the end of World War II.
   Last week, protesters hurling rocks and firebombs attacked U.S.
cultural centers in Seoul and in the southern city of Kwangju and
hurled homemade bombs at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.
   Dissidents said Thursday they would continue the anti-U.S.
campaign and called a major anti-U.S. rally in Seoul on Friday to
mark the end of the eighth anniversary of a 1980 civil uprising in
Kwangju, where thousands of students and citizens battled police in
daily protests.
   Dissidents contend the United States condoned the South Korean
army's bloody suppression of the nine-day uprising, in which at
least 191 people were killed.
   A 20-year-old student who had called for a full probe of the
Kwangju uprising died in a hospital Thursday after dousing himself
with kerosene and setting himself afire during a campus rally May
18.
   About 400 students shouting anti-U.S. and anti-government
slogans staged a sit-in protest at the hospital in Seoul where Choi
Duk-soo died. Choi was a student at Dankook University.
   In South Korea, suicide is sometimes used as a form of protest.
   In a Cabinet meeting, Lee called for a crackdown against
radicals and tighter security around foreign facilities.
   Lee said the recent protests posed a threat to the people and
``inflicted undesirable influence on the nation's security and
diplomacy before staging the Olympics.''
   The Olympic Games open in Seoul in September.

Growth</HEAD>

   The U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly rapid
annual rate of 3.9 percent from January through March, much better
than previously believed, because of the biggest decline in the
trade deficit in eight years, the government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, was propelled during the first
three months of the year by an export surge, a rebound in car sales
and a boom in business capital investment.
   The report represented a sharp upward revision from an initial
estimate made a month ago that the GNP grew at a more modest 2.3
percent rate in the first quarter.
   It provided fresh evidence that the economy has escaped
unscathed from last fall's stock market crash, and it sent
economists scurrying to revise up their growth estimates for the
full year.
   ``You would have to say that not only was the stock market crash
ignored, but the economy thumbed its nose at it,'' said Robert
Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said he had
revised his forecast to show GNP growth of 3.5 percent for all of
1988. That would be the fastest rate of growth since 1984.
   ``The Reagan years are ending with a bang. The first quarter GNP
report shows an economy that is amazingly strong and resilient for
such an aging expansion,'' Sinai said.
   All the good economic news is especially pleasing to Republicans
in an election year when they hope George Bush will win the White
House running on a platform emphasizing the peacetime record of 66
months of expansion since the last recession in 1981-82.
   The economic growth in the first quarter was a far cry from the
recession that some analysts had predicted immediately following
the Oct. 19 collapse in stock prices. However, economists now have
begun to worry that inflationary pressures have begun rising
because the economy is growing so rapidly.
   Those fears are present despite the fact that a GNP price index
which measures a changing marketbasket of goods rose at an annual
rate of just 1.7 percent in the first quarter, the smallest
increase since late 1984.
   Analysts said this performance masked growing price pressures
stemming from tight labor markets and the rising number of
industries that are pushing against capacity constraints.
Unemployment fell to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent in April.
   In a second report Thursday, the government said after-tax
corporate profits rose just 0.5 percent in the first quarter of the
year following a much larger 2.6 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch in New
York, said the weak profit rise in the first quarter would add to
inflation pressures as companies seek to boost revenues by raising
prices in coming months.
   ``The inflation environment is deteriorating. The economy is
growing too rapidly for stable prices,'' Steinberg said.
   Analysts predicted that the Federal Reserve, whose job it is to
worry about inflation, will push interest rates higher to dampen
demand. The central bank already has tightened credit conditions
twice in the past two months.
   Frank Cappiello, a Wall Street investment adviser, said the fast
GNP growth in the first quarter was adding to inflationary
pressures and setting the stage for a recession next year.
   ``What (the GNP increase) reflects is light from a dying star,''
Cappiello said during an appearance in Omaha. ``You're seeing the
best growth in the economy. I think from here on in it will be
dragged down by higher (interest) rates.''
   But Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser,
disputed that contention, saying there was no evidence of either
recession or inflation threats in the GNP figures.
   ``We had an upward revision in real growth, a downward revision
in inflation and greater strength on the exports side,'' Sprinkel
said in an interview. ``These are all objectives of this
administration.''
   The administration's current forecast calls for GNP growth of
2.9 percent this year. With the fast start, the economy could grow
as slowly as 1.9 percent for the rest of the year and still reach
that estimate.
   About 80 percent of the improvement in the GNP report from the
previous estimate came from a bigger shrinkage in the trade deficit
than previously believed. The trade defict declined at an annual
rate of $16.7 billion in the first quarter, the sharpest narrowing
since early 1980, as exports, after adjusting for inflation, rose
20.7 percent while imports were up only 3.4 percent.
   The 3.9 percent overall GNP growth rate followed an even
stronger 4.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter. However, that
increase came almost entirely from a buildup of unsold inventories
which was occurring at the same time that consumer spending was
posting a rare decline.
   Growth in the first quarter was much more balanced, with
consumer spending rising by 4.3 percent, reflecting in large part a
rebound in car sales.
   In addition, business investment for capital equipment shot up a
remarkable 32.8 percent, the biggest rise in more than four years.
Analysts attributed this investment surge to the improving trade
deficit which has sent U.S. companies scurrying to expand
production facilities in order to meet higher export demand.
   Analysts said they were looking for slightly slower growth of
around 3 percent in the current April-June quarter due to an
expected slowdown in growth of export sales, consumer spending and
business investment from the rapid rate of the first quarter.
   The various changes left the GNP rising by $37.2 billion in the
first quarter, an annual level of $3.92 trillion, after adjusting
for the effects of inflation.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Plummet On Rumors Ivory Coast Re-Enters Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices plummeted Thursday on rumors that the Ivory
Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, had sold up to 100,000
tons of cocoa beans after a two-month absence from the market.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans finished lower; energy,
livestock, meat and stock-index futures advanced; and precious
metals were mixed.
   The Ivory Coast, an African nation that is world's largest
exporter of cocoa beans, withdrew from the cash market more than
two months ago because prices were so low.
   Prices subsequently rose more than $150, with the contract for
July delivery of cocoa on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New
York settling Wednesday at $1,685 a ton compared with $1,507 a ton
on March 15.
   Rumors Thursday morning that the Ivory Coast had sold as much as
100,000 tons of cocoa to a consortium of trade houses sent futures
prices tumbling as much as $100 during the session. The contract
for delivery in July settled Thursday at $1,596 a ton, off $89 from
Wednesday's final price.
   ``Everybody understood that as soon as the Ivory Coast came out,
the rally was going to end and we saw it today,'' said Sandra Kaul,
an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Philipp Brothers Inc., one of the trade houses rumored to be
among the purchasing group, would not comment on the rumors.
   Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade with wheat prices down sharply on concerns about increased
production next year.
   The Agriculture Department approved a new wheat price-support
program Wednesday that will allow greater wheat production next
year, a prospect seen as strongly negative for prices, analysts
said.
   Mixed forecasts for weekend weather also pressured the markets,
with most traders expecting significant rainfall before the end of
the long Memorial Day weekend, said Walter Spilka, an analyst in
New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``The wheat crop is maturing and rain would be very helpful as
the crop starts to `head' out there,'' Spilka said. ``Heading''
refers to a critical phase of the wheat-ripening process.
   Soybean futures closed well above their session lows, an
indication of the market's resilience to bearish news, he said.
   Wheat settled 4{ cents to 10 cents lower with July at $3.36} a
bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with July at $2.12} a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent lower with July at $1.71 a
bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 14{ cents lower with July at $7.54
a bushel.
   Gasoline and heating-oil contracts posted strong gains on the
New York Mercantile Exchange amid traditional pre-Memorial Day
buying, analysts said.
   The Memorial Day weekend marks the beginning of the summer
driving season, when demand for gasoline typically rises, said
Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc.
   Some buying also was linked to the June 8 meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, although Beutel said
there was little chance of the OPEC ministers agreeing to
production cuts.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents to 20 cents
higher with July at $17.54 a barrel; heating oil was .58 cent to
.88 cent higher with June at 48.19 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .54 cent to .63 cent higher with June at 52.35 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as cash and wholesale prices steadied after
falling for several days, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .45 cent higher with June at
72.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .50 cent higher
with May at 80.97 cents a pound; hogs settled .20 cent lower to .33
cent higher with June at 53.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to .23 cent higher with July at 53.40 cents a pound.
   Gold finished nearly unchanged while silver advanced slightly in
listless trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold settled 70 cents lower to 70 cents higher with June at
$454.10 a troy ounce; silver was 1.6 cents to 1.8 cents higher with
May at $6.61 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures posted modest gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.60 points higher at 255.60.

   The nation's basic money supply fell $1.5
billion in the week ended May 16, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure of money known as M1 fell to a
seasonally adjusted average of $768.1 billion from a revised $769.6
billion the previous week.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks.
   The Fed said a broader measure of money, known as M2, rose $2.5
billion to an average of $3.002 trillion in the week ended May 16.
M2 equals M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and
money-market mutual funds.
   The broadest measure of money, known as M3, fell by $300 million
to $3.775 trillion in the week ended May 16, the Fed said. M3
equals M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of
deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000.
   For the 13 weeks ended May 16, M1 averaged $765.9 billion, a 2.9
percent rate of decline from the previous 13 weeks, the Fed said.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is paying
little attention to M1 but instead is monitoring the value of the
dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short- and
long-term interest rates. It also has shifted more attention to the
two broader money supply measures.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell by $1.1 billion
in the week ended May 18, compared with a decline of $506 million
the previous week. The latest decline brought the total to $56.807
billion.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $388 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, down from $406 million a day the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $275.6 billion in the two-week period ended May
18, down from $276.5 billion two weeks earlier.

   Gannett Co. Inc. said Thursday it plans to buy
back up to 7.5 million shares of the company's 162 million issued
shares of common stock.
   Gannett's board of directors authorized the repurchase on the

the company said in a statement.
   The purchases will occur ``from time to time,'' and no maximum

   Allen H. Neuharth, chairman of Gannett, and John J. Curley,
president and chief executive officer of the company, said the
current low trading prices of Gannett's stock make it an
``excellent investment compared to recent media acquisition
prices.''
   Gannett stock closed at $30.75, up $1.12{ in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Thursday.
   Gannett publishes USA Today, 89 daily newspapers, 35 nondaily
newspapers and USA Weekend, a newspaper magazine. It also operates
10 television stations, 16 radio stations and Gannett News Service

<HEAD>Boeing 757 Moves From Stepchild To Star</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, the 757 had been the stepchild in
Boeing's fleet: a plane highly praised but seldom bought.
   But in a flurry of multibillion-dollar orders, including United
Airlines' announcement Thursday that it was ordering 30 757s and
taking options on 30 more, the twin-engine, medium-range jetliner
suddenly is Boeing Commercial Airplanes' hot item.
   ``It's been a very pleasant week, hasn't it?'' said Boeing
spokesman Jim Boynton.
   Boeing valued the 30 firm orders at $1.3 billion. United did not
give exact figures for the total order's value except to say it was
``in excess of $2 billion'' including planes, spare parts and
engines.
   On Wednesday, American Airlines confirmed a long-expected order
for 50 757s, valued at more than $2 billion, and options for 50
more at the same price.
   On May 16, International Lease Finance Corp. ordered 100 Boeing
planes and took options on 24. The firm orders include nine 757s.
With a value of $4.6 billion for the 124 planes, the order was a
record for Boeing.
   This year alone, Boeing has received orders for 120 757s and
options for 80 more. In comparison, just 239 757s had been ordered
from 1978, when the plane was launched, through 1987.
   In all, Boeing has had 356 jets ordered in 1988 with an
estimated value of $14.9 billion. That's just 10 fewer than the 366
Boeing commercial jets ordered for all of 1987. The value of 1987
jet orders was $19.9 billion, a company record.
   Industry analysts say Boeing could see its fourth straight year
of record orders, perhaps up to $25 billion.
   At a Thursday news conference, Boeing Commerical Airplanes
President Dean Thornton said the American order was a strong
endorsement for Boeing and for a plane he felt will be a mainstay
for U.S. airlines.
   ``I think most of you know that we've been probably a little
disappointed with the 757 over the years,'' he said.
   But now, Thornton said, ``The 757 is fast becoming the new
workhorse for U.S. carriers because it answers the challenges of
operating into congested or controlled airports where high capacity
is desired'' without adding flights.
   The 757 was to be a larger, quieter and more fuel-efficient
replacement for the three-engine 727, which was designed in the
late 1950s and entered service in 1964. The 757 won accolades, but
few orders, especially as fuel prices went down in the mid-1980s.
   Airlines seemed content to stay with the older, fuel-guzzling
planes rather than front the $41 million to $47 million cost of a
757. Also, said William Whitlow, analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Seattle, the hub and feeder-line route system airlines adopted
favored smaller, shorter-range airplanes.
   ``The 757 was an airplane a bit ahead of its time in terms of
our ability to assimilate it,'' Robert Baker, American's vice
president for operations, said Wednesday. But he added, ``the
now-proven economics and operating characteristics of the airplane,
I think, have been borne out.''
   United's 757s will have Pratt & Whitney engines and will carry
192 passengers. American's jets will use Rolls Royce engines and
haul 194 passengers. Both versions have normal ranges of about
3,300 miles.
   Analysts and airline executives cite several reasons for the
757's sudden popularity:
   _The airlines' older planes are requiring more maintenance.
``It's just like a car, you can keep going forever'' with
maintenance and repairs, said Paul Nisbet, analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. ``But there's a point
where the economics don't pay.''
   _The 757 is cheaper to run. Boeing says it's unsurpassed in
fuel-efficiency, burning up to 43 percent less than a 727 and up to
33 percent less than competing twinjets. It also uses a flight crew
of two, instead of three for the 727.
   Baker also noted that 53 percent of the parts in a 757 are
interchangeable with Boeing's wide-body 767, and that pilots
certified for one plane are easily switched to the other.
   _The 757 exceeds the toughest airport noise standards, said
Stephen M. Wolf, chairman, president and chief executive officer of
United.
   The airplane industry may be turning into a sellers' market.
Nisbet said production for comparable planes, including Boeing's
smaller 737, McDonnell Douglas' MD-80 and Airbus Industries' A320,
is nearly all booked. ``If you want an airplane delivered before
1991 ... you have to go for the 757,'' he said.
   Wolfgang Demisch, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland in New
York, said that as production fills up, airplane prices also will
rise. ``The desire to sort of get in before the gates close and
prices go up is not far from the airlines' mind,'' he said.
   Thornton acknowledged that Boeing is on a roll, but did not
think it could last.
   ``I just believe that things go up and down,'' he said.
   United will receive its first 757 in August 1989 and five more
that year, Wolf said. It will get 21 more in 1990 and three in 1991.

<HEAD>Corporate Raider Files Slander Suit Over Remark That He
``Welshed''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Well-known corporate raider Paul A.
Bilzerian, who frequently battles industrial titans, has filed a
slander suit against a Little League officer.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in Pinellas Circuit Court, charges
that Rick Brannelly, first vice president of the Northeast Little
League, made false statements about Bilzerian that appeared in an
article in the St. Petersburg Times on Saturday.
   The dispute revolves around whether the league met its 1987
fund-raising goal or fell short by $52.25 as charged by Bilzerian,
who bought the Singer Co. in February for $1.06 million.
   In spring and summer, Bilzerian has coached a baseball team of
5, 6 and 7-year-olds and his Tampa based firm, Bicoastal Financial
Corp. has sponsored a team.
   In the newspaper article, Brannelly maintained Bilzerian failed
to provide a matching $5,000 donation he promised to the league if
it raised $5,000 on its own.
   Brannelly claimed Bilzerian ``welshed'' on the promise made
before dozens of people, according to the Times.
   Bilzerian's attorney Michael Ingram was quoted in the story
saying the league failed to meet its fund-raising goal and
therefore Bilzerian was under no obligation to make the donation.
   Such statements by Brannelly, the suit alleges, have ``a
tendency to injure Bilzerian in his office, occupation, business or
employment.''
   The suit seeks punitive damages in excess of $5,000, the minimum
amount required to get a civil case into circuit court.
   Bilzerian was out of town and could not be reached for comment
Thursday. Ingram was called but was not available Thursday.
   Singer spokesman Tom Elliott said only ``I think it's all pretty
much in the complaint.''

   The fuel tank collapse that caused the
contamination of drinking water in three states stemmed from a
dime-size flaw in the tank's nearly 50-year-old steel wall, Ashland
Oil Inc. said Thursday.
   The 4-million-gallon storage tank collapsed Jan. 2 as it was
being filled with 3.8 million gallons of oil, spilling more than
700,000 gallons into the Monongahela River and then the Ohio River.
   A combination of factors aggravated the impact of the flaw and
caused the wall of the tank to split in less than a second, sending
the oil over the dike ``like a skier going off a jump,'' according
to Ray Mesloh, head of a team from an independent research
institute that investigated the accident for Ashland.
   The steel wall of the tank was first assembled in Cleveland in
1940. It was taken apart and reconstructed at the company's
Floreffe Terminal south of Pittsburgh in 1986.
   The original welds and the welds made during the reconstruction
made the steel more brittle, said Mesloh, of the Battelle Memorial
Institute of Columbus, Ohio.
   Other factors in the collapse were the relative weakness of
World War II-era steel, pressure from the 3.8 million gallons of
diesel fuel inside and the cold weather, he said.
   ``If you had a combination of these same events, it could happen
again,'' said John R. Hall, chairman of the Ashland, Ky., firm.
   However, Hall said, ``Once again, and I hope for the last time,
we apologize.''
   The flaw was in the steel before Ashland assembled the tank near
Cleveland. It was caused by a torch, possibly one used to cut the
plate at the mill where it was made, Mesloh said.
   The flaw, a small, rusting cavity about one-eighth inch deep,
was located near a weld about 8 feet from the bottom of the tank's
48-foot-high wall, said Mesloh, displaying the defective steel at a
news conference.
   ``It is likely that flaw would have been found by X-raying,''
Mesloh said.
   Hall also emphasized that similar fuel tanks are in use around
the country and that the Jan. 2 accident could happen elsewhere,
too.
   The American Petroleum Institute said there were about 1,850
major oil terminals in 1987, many with more than one tank, in the
United States. The institute does not track the age of tanks, said
spokeswoman Jane Van Ryan.
   Ashland has concluded that improvements are needed in some of
the 1,000 large tanks it has inspected and has abandoned the
practice of moving old tanks, Hall said.
   The estimated 713,000 gallons of oil that escaped the tank's
protective dike forced communities along the Monongahela and Ohio
rivers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to close their
drinking water intakes. About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents
were without tap water for almost a week.
   The accident spawned a flurry of legislation in Congress,
including a bill that Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., on Thursday said
``would have required Ashland to test the tank before using it.
That is not now required.''
   Walgren's bill would set standards for above-ground tanks with
capacity of morew than 4,200 gallons.
   The U.S. Bureau of Standards, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
are also investigating the Ashland spill.
   Besides failing to obtain all the local permits required for
erecting the tank, Ashland said it failed to fill the tank with
water, a test recommended by the American Petroleum Institute.
   More than 4,000 claims seeking about $18 million in damages have
been filed against Ashland, which says it is fully covered by
insurance. Ashland said it has paid about $7 million, including $6
million in clean-up costs.

<TEXT>
   The House passed a $1.1 trillion federal
budget for the 1989 fiscal year Thursday after negotiators from the
House and Senate solved a month-long dispute over domestic spending.
   The measure was approved by a 201-181 vote and sent to the
Senate, where it was expected to be accepted after that chamber
returns from its Memorial Day recess next month.
   Twenty-six Republicans joined 175 Democrats in voting for the
measure, which is moving toward its earliest congressional approval
in years. The legislators, however, already have upheld their
annual tradition of missing the April 15 deadline set in the law
for completing the budget.
   The spending plan would satisfy the limits placed on defense,
domestic and international affairs spending that were set in last
fall's budget summit agreement between President Reagan and
congressional leaders.
   It also would avoid automatic spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law later in the year by producing a
deficit just under the law's $146 billion deficit ceiling.
   ``It has been designed bipartisanly, in good faith to avoid''
the automatic cuts, said House Budget Committee Chairman William H.
Gray III, D-Pa.
   However, some lawmakers warned that Gramm-Rudman spending cuts
could still be forced later this year if the economy worsens.
   ``We should be scaling back spending below the summit levels,''
said Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr., R-Ohio.
   Under the law, the budget's deficit will be recalculated in
August, and a weakening economy usually increases federal spending
and reduces the taxes it collects.
   The last dispute that negotiators from the two chambers resolved
was over new spending in domestic entitlement programs. In such
programs, formulas in the law automatically decide how much money
will be spent.
   The House wanted to increase that spending by $100 million next
year and $1.3 billion over three years, while the Senate sought a
$500 million increase for 1989 and $2 billion more over three years.
   Under the compromise, such spending will grow by $375 million
next year and by $2.2 billion over the three years, with most of it
being used for nutrition programs for the poor.
   The measure contains $299.5 billion in new defense spending,
$18.1 billion for international affairs and $148 billion for
domestic programs for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   The amount for the Pentagon is an $8.1 billion increase over
military spending this year, but below the amount that would have
been needed to keep up with inflation.
   Education, health, social services and job training programs
would all be given enough money to keep up with inflation. And
selected other programs _ including those for AIDS research and
treatment, anti-drug initiatives, space and air traffic control _
would get enough new money to surpass the costs of inflation.
   The election-year measure would allow an additional $1.4 billion
in anti-drug spending to be provided later this year if Congress
and the White House decide that an emergency exists. The extra
money would have to be covered by spending reductions in other
areas or by new revenues.
   In legislation passed in December that enacted the terms of the
budget summit, $14 billion in new taxes for fiscal 1989 already
have been written into law. The budget approved Thursday includes
no other additional revenues.
   The House passed its original version of the budget March 23,
and the Senate completed its work April 14.
   The two chambers had differences _ small ones in budget terms _
over how the domestic spending was to be divided.
   The Senate sought $13.4 billion for space and science programs
and $36.6 billion for education and job programs, while the House
wanted $12.5 billion for science and $37.6 billion for education.
   In their compromise, the lawmakers agreed to $13 billion for
science and $37.2 billion for education.
   They also agreed to a 4 percent pay raise for military personnel
and federal civilian employees to take effect in January. The
Senate had sought a 2 percent increase for civilians and a 4.3
percent raise for the armed services, while the House had sought a
3 percent increase for each category.
   The raise also would apply to members of Congress, who already
earn $89,500 annually. If included in forthcoming appropriations
bills, members of Congress would earn $93,080 a year, a raise of
$3,580.
   The budget does not require the president's signature, and is
used as a guideline by Congress as it passes the 13 appropriations
bills that actually provide money for federal spending. But this
year, its value seems even more questionable than usual.
   While the House-Senate negotiators spent six weeks trying to
iron out their differences, the two chambers' appropriations
committees began work on their spending measures.
   Thus, the House already has passed four of the 13 appropriations
bills, while the Senate appropriations committee has taken the
first steps in writing its spending measures.

<HEAD>Court Orders Extension Of Bank of NY Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New York Co. said Thursday it agreed to
extend its hostile $1.1 billion bid for Irving Bank Corp. for one
week until next Friday.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said the company made the
extension at the request of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   The court is hearing a suit Irving filed last week against Bank
of New York alleging the unwanted suitor violated federal
securities laws when it amended its takeover bid to seek two-thirds
of Irving's stock rather than all of it.
   Irving claimed the company failed to adequately notify
shareholders of the financial ramincations of the amended offer.
   Irving management is backing a friendly merger with the
state-run Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second-largest
bank.
   Bank of New York is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its
stock for each of Irving's outstanding shares.
   The company is proceeding with its tender offer although it
recently lost a crucial proxy battle for control of Irving's board.
As of last Monday, it held about 50 percent of Irving's shares,
including those it owned and those tendered to it.
   Banca Commerciale is offering $80 a share for a 51 percent stake
in Irving, or about $760 million. The bid is part of a complex
restructuring plan that includes sale of Irving assets, several
cost-cutting measures and a special $10 dividend.

   The Holme, a 170-year-old London
mansion claimed to be the world's most expensive dwelling, is on
the market for about $58 million, a California real estate agent
said Thursday.
   The 26,000-square-foot house in prestigious Regents Park sits on
4.5 acres of landscaped, terraced grounds. It features a grand
dining room, a library, and an all-weather tennis court, said Mike
Silverman, an agent who specializes in accommodations for the rich

   The Holme was designed by Decimus Burton and completed in 1818.
Modern amenities include eight garages, luxury elevators, sauna,
whirlpool bath and exercise rooms.
   Silverman, who said he has an exclusive listing for the Holme,
claimed the asking price, 30 million pounds sterling, is the
highest sought anywhere.
   The identities of the occupants were not revealed.
   ``There's a family that lives there whose lifestyle has
changed,'' said Jane Harman, a spokeswoman for Silverman. She added
that the house has been on the market for several weeks.

   Higher electricity prices caused by
scrapping the Shoreham nuclear plant could cramp Long Island
industry, already burdened by high energy costs, economists and
industrialists said Thursday.
   ``No doubt about it, higher rates will hurt growth,'' said
Martin Melkonian, a Hofstra University economics professor. ``But
it won't be the factor that brings Long Island to its knees.''
   Melkonian was a co-author of ``Project 2000,'' a report on the
island's energy needs written for businesses.
   He noted that the Long Island Lighting Co.'s rates have
increased more than 300 percent in the last decade compared with a
national average of 195 percent and are already among the highest
in the nation.
   According to Energy User News, a trade publication, LILCO has
the seventh-highest commercial rates in the nation. For residences,
the cost is 11.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, meaning a household that
uses 600 kilowatt-hours a month would have a monthly bill of
$70.20, LILCO reported.
   ``We are used to the high cost of energy,'' Melkonian said.
``The cost of energy in relation to the total value of the product
output here is relatively small.''
   Under Thursday's agreement to dismantle the never-used, $5.3
billion plant, the estimated $500 million decommissioning cost will
be paid for by ratepayers over 10 years.
   Richard Kessel, a state negotiator on the LILCO deal and Gov.
Mario Cuomo's chief adviser on consumer issues, said the agreement
would increase the average Long Island resident's electric bill by
a little more than $3 per month.
   LILCO would get a guaranteed 5 percent increase in rates each
year for three years, and 5 percent would be the target increase
for each of the following seven years.
   James LaRocca, president of the Long Island Association, an
organization of 2,000 companies, said that would mean a 63 percent
total increase.
   ``This is a very expensive deal which has to be borne entirely
by Long Islanders,'' he said. ``Our rates will be significantly
higher when three other utilities in New York are in the midst of a
multiyear rate freeze.''
   ``We are already seeing the consequences of Long Island's
decreasing ability to compete,'' LaRocca said.
   A direct mail company recently fled Suffolk County for
Pennsylvania and saw its electric bill plummet from $48,000 a month
to $19,000 a month, LaRocca said.
   Grumman Corp. of Bethpage, the Navy's prime contractor and Long
Island's largest employer, expanded its facilities last year but
did it in Houston, citing the high cost of energy and taxes on Long
Island.
   Grumman has 23,500 employes on the island. It pays $30 million a
year for electricity.
   ``People with cheaper power can be more competitive in the
market,'' said Robert Harwood, a Grumman spokesman. ``The cost has
to be passed along to the consumer and in our case that is the
American taxpayer.''
   Harwood found a silver lining, however, to the steady rate hikes
planned: some certainty and stability, with companies able to plan
better.
   ``Our overall problem is that we did not know what was going to
happen with rates,'' said Harwood. ``Now we can plan.''
   Long Island has a thriving economy with one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the country, a highly skilled and educated
work force and one of the largest multinational business
communities in the region.
   ``There will be a substantial impact on rates, particularly with
those in the manufacturing industry,'' said Martin Cantor, Suffolk
County's director of economic development. ``But I think the rates
will be absorbed without too much hardship.''
   Wayne Prospect, deputy supervisor of the Suffolk Legislature,
criticized the proposed settlement as an ``economic bailout for
LILCO.''
   ``The people of Long Island wanted that nuclear power plant
closed,'' he said. ``I guess higher electric rates is the economic
tradeoff.''

   Striking television and movie scriptwriters
claimed they had split management ranks Thursday after 64
producers, including the makers of ``The Cosby Show'' and Johnny
Carson's talk show, signed independent contracts with the writers'
union.
   Several of the firms that signed with the Writers Guild of
America produce successful television programs for NBC.
   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers,
representing the industry's biggest producers, downplayed the
signings, which represent a significant break in the 12-week strike.
   The walkout has forced delays in the start of the fall
television season and reruns of such shows as ``Late Night with
David Letterman'' and ``The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.''
   The 9,000-member Writers Guild of America was scheduled to vote
Thursday night in New York and Los Angeles on contracts with
smaller, so-called independent producers.
   Voting results wouldn't be known until Friday, said union
spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden in Los Angeles.
   ``We're anticipating ratification,'' Ms. Rhoden said. ``We see
it strategically as a good move at this time to break the logjam
with the alliance.''
   Ms. Rhoden released the names of the independent producers and
the terms of their three-year contract with the WGA before members
gathered to vote on the proposal. The contract includes increases
in foreign residual payments and provides writers with greater
creative input.
   The list of 64 production companies includes the Carsey-Werner
Company, which produces two of the most popular shows on
television, ``The Cosby Show'' and ``A Different World.''
   The makers of ``Tonight'' signed a contract and the producers of
``Late Night'' have agreed to a contract but haven't signed, said
union President George Kirgo. Others signing were producers of
``Alf'' and ``The Muppets.''
   Also on the list are Michael Landon Productions, which makes
``Highway to Heaven'' and You and Me Kid Productions, the maker of
the now-cancelled ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.''
   Most of the producers appear to be film companies, such as The
Gaby Film Group Inc., and some, such as Paul Keyes Productions,
produce TV specials.
   None of the 217 big producers who belong to the alliance have
signed independent contracts, management spokesman Herb Steinberg
said Thursday.
   The large producers, whose ranks include such big-time
moviemakers as Columbia Pictures and such TV giants as MTM and
Lorimar, employ 80 percent of the industry's writers and supply 84
percent of prime-time TV, he noted.
   ``The alliance producers are holding strong,'' Steinberg said.
   ``This is all very, very interesting, but it has no impact on
the new season or on the contract negotiations,'' Steinberg said.
``What they're talking about makes no change in the point of
conflict, which are the deficits for productions of one-hour
prime-time TV shows and the depressed market for those shows in
syndication.''
   Nearly 180 producers had discussed independent agreements, which
meet the writers' demands on residual payments they receive when
shows are rerun and for consultation on script changes made during
filming, she said.
   Those are the main points of contention in the strike, which
began March 7.
   On Monday, both sides sat down with a federal mediator for the
first time since April 8. The talks at alliance headquarters in the
Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks failed to produce agreement on
any issue.
   Negotiators agreed to meet in small groups Saturday and set
another full bargaining session Tuesday.

   The U.S. dollar gained moderately against the
Japanese yen in morning trading Thursday, while Tokyo share prices
also rose.
   After opening at 124.35 yen, up only 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
close, the dollar continued to edge up and was changing hands at
about 124.43 yen at late morning.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei stock average of 225
selected issues, which gained 130.99 points Wednesday, added
another 48.26 points, or 0.17 percent, to close the morning session
at 27,491.91. The Tokyo market's leading barometer hit a
mid-morning high of 27,641.49 points, but then fell on
profit-taking in heavy trading.
   Traders said Wednesday's dip on Wall Street did not discourage
investors in Tokyo stocks. The dollar's strength reflected a strong
closing Wednesday in New York, they said.
